B003YL4LYI|2.0|This was my least favorite of all the Song of Ice and Fire books. Even though it focuses on a lot of my favorite characters, very little of any consequence to the plot occurs in the entire book. In my opinion it could easily have been cut by 2/3's of its overall length and been much much better for it. The problem is if you have read this far into the series already you are probably too heavily invested in finding out what happens to quit now. My advice would be to borrow the book or check it out from your local library rather than spend any money to read it. It isn't worth any amount of money to read about how Jon Snow needs to feed some people, or how Dany suspects there is intrigue going on around her without ever finding out exactly what it was. As happens in just about every commercially successful \\"epic\\" fantasy series it appears that Mr. Martin has decided to pad the series a bit in order to add as many cars as possible on to the gravy train.

1439153663|5.0|This book appealed to me especially that it brought back memories of my mother's stories of her voyage from Belfast, Ireland at the age of six . Although the time was later - she came in 1886- and circumstances were a lot different, Lavinia touched my heart from the outset.  While she came with her grandmother and several aunts and uncles, her parents came the following year with their other two  childrenTheir 11 year old daughter,  Mary, died while on the trip and was buried at sea.  How different Lavinia and her brother's lives would have been had that fate not happened to<br />their parents!<br /><br />Personal thoughts aside, this book should be required reading if all that want to try to understand life during slavery in the South.  We have come a long way but there is still a long way to go.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|Jonathan and Charlotte came in second place on the 2012 season of Britain's Got Talent.  The audition video is amazing (available on YouTube).  Simon initially panned them, until he heard those voices.  He then told Jonathan he should drop Charlotte, Jonathan disagreed.  After coming in second, Simon signed them for a million british pounds (about 1.6 million USD).  I don't know which was more amazing Simon signing them or actually admitting he was wrong.  Either way, while their story is amazing, the truly incredible thing about this album is their talent.  Ave Maria is the best rendition I've ever heard.  The entire album is an incredible mix of Jonathans powerful operatic tone and Charlotte's sweet pop vocals.  It's a mix that's better than... well pretty much anything. Buy it, get a copy for your friends, get another copy for your family... Can you tell I'm a big fan?
B008VBYN80|3.0|It is a fun game. The graphics and music are good too. The only thing disappointing is how you really need to buy gems in order to advance in the game. If it were possible to convert money into gems,  the game would be even better. Overall,  pretty fun.

B002LB7S10|5.0|I remember when this movie came out when I was a teenager.  I had nightmares about it for months then.  When the remake came out, I had to see it.  It kept the fear factor and seriously messed up subject matter that the original did.  Still scared the caca out of me too!!!!!  Loved it.  Not for little kids or even teens.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|This was a present for my husband's birthday and neither one of us were disappointed.  We have all the previous Fourplay music.  I was so afraid that, as so often happens to bands that have played together consistently well,  the group would veer off onto an unusual path in the quest for something new and end up with something just different and not pleasing.  Espirit De Four is a gem, each song better than the next!  Loved it!
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I usually watch whatever superhero movie is out, not that I am a big fan but who doesn't like a saving the world movie. This movie with all the heroes together I thought would be fun to watch. I never read comic books and thought this movie had a boring plot and It just took to long to get going. I thought the movie was too much around Iron Man and his ego.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Andriod smart phone users need a quality Cloud experince which Amazon is well positioned to provide.  However, while the price is reasonable the user experience is lacking.  If one were to use Pandora as the benchmark then the Amazon MP3 Player is limited in the features provded and user interface is lacking.<br /><br />The recent ehancement of \\"upgrading\\" uploaded music looked like it might be a positive step towards  \\"iTunes\\" level service.  However, the upgrades were limited and since the initial migration I have not had a single uploaded song meet Amazon's upgrade criteria.  As such, it has become more of a quality detractor.<br /><br />Bottom line, the Amazon Cloud experience is \\"okay\\" but has work to do before it can earn those extra stars...
159420411X|5.0|This book has received a wide array of reviews here, but I'll focus on the key elements within it that I think are essential to everyone living today in our complex, information laden world with predictions coming to us from all sides with much 'authority' behind them.  In a short summary, the book informs us of the reasons behind bad predictions, and provides guidance as to how to make good ones.  The author points out five underlying concepts that influence decisions 1) the interaction between signal and noise and the difficulties in sorting one from the other 2)the difference between causality and correlation 3) the difference between forecasts and predictions 4)how the thinking of 'hedgehogs and foxes' deals with the complexity of signal mixed with noise --(and how the 'hedgehogs' end up as thought leaders' because of their focus on 'one big idea' rather than the more complex thinking of the 'foxes') and 5) the critical importance of Bayes theorem with its need to understand 'prior probabilities' in making decisions, and how those prior probabilities can be generated and modified.<br /><br />This is not just an academic exercise as we are bombarded with confident predictions that misuse or fail to use these principles.  The author illustrates these by examples.  One of them is the heated discussion around global warming, in which the causality is certain (effect of carbon dioxide on the greenhouse effect), the signal to noise is high, predictions and forecasts are confused, how the politics favor the 'hedgehogs' and how prior probabilities can be factored in.  Other examples used are political and economic and sports predictions...all used to clarify how we can factor in the massive amount and burden of information swirling around the topics.<br /><br />The failure of predictions in an intelligent and data laden world is a constant theme and caution to help better understand how these can be so wrong, and what we, as consumers of information, can do to better understand the process and variables.<br /><br />The book is written in an easy to understand way but includes complex and important ideas that the author gets across clearly and well as he walks his way through the examples, and the analysis of the thought processes that go into them. The example of the possible finding to predict an 'unfaithful spouse' is the best example of Bayes theorem that I have read, along with the more classical one of the need to use prior probabilities in evaluating the use of cancer screening, again recently in the news relative to the value of mammograms in breast cancer and PSA testing in prostate cancer.  If you've been confused(as many have been) by those controversies in the press and the heated advocacy on each side, this book explains how to cut through the verbiage and better understand the process of how such predictions can best be made.<br /><br />This is a must read book for anyone trying to figure out what will or can 'happen next' -- which is the core goal of predictive science and vital to our understanding of the major issues of today.
0321127420|2.0|I didn't think much of this book. Martin uses really complicated words to explain simple concepts. He literally drowns in his own verbage. Although, many of the ideas discussed in the book are relevant and useful, they are also mostly intuitive to the average developer.
1401937519|5.0|This book gave an interesting account of a Near Death experience that I haven't encountered before, and I've investigated a lot of Near Death Experiences. We're all going to die. It's not a question of \\"if,\\" but a question of \\"when.\\" Personally, I would like all of the information I can garner, before that fateful day occurs.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|After having read the book I was disappointed with the movie. Too many unexplained events and it was disjointed in jumping from scene to scene. The video streamed well, as usual. Amazon Video on Demand is my first choice when renting a movie.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|My mom introduced this series to me just last week. I watched one episode and was curious so she gave me the entire first season on DVD to barrow. I watched it and I am now hooked and quiet enjoy it. I also love the show \\"Life\\" (which lasted one season) and I find this much better then \\"numbers\\" which somehow bored me after a while (too squeaky clean). I've just purchased season 2 via stream on amazon.  It sometimes has a little bit of a Macgyver-esque quality to it which I also like, which sometimes doesn't 100% make sense because while I know Jane is very intelligent and clever it doesn't always make sense why he knows random things. I love when they get into the phycology part of it all I enjoy episodes that center around Red John or do not at all, and for once in my life I can watch a show and say that I REALLy like all of the characters on it, the whole \\"CBI\\" team are wonderful actors and each play their parts perfectly.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|Somehow he did it. Christopher Nolan has completed, for me, the ultimate Batman series. Ever since I was a child reading Batman and Detective Comics in the late 70's I've always wanted to see Batman on the big screen. But the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher films didn't quite satisfy me. No, I wanted a grittier Batman, not necessarily the darker Frank Miller style, but still somewhat grounded in reality. A Batman, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon and Rogue's Gallery that bares resemblance to that of the Denny O'Neil era, or possibly the later Jeph Loeb years.<br /><br />Then, in 2005, BATMAN BEGINS is released into theaters. Compared to Bat-movies of the past, it arrived with surprisingly modest hype. I guess we were all weary and cautious from the BATMAN & ROBIN debacle that came before it. Still, I had fairly high hopes as I sat in the theater. And before my eyes I saw the greatest Batman film ever...well, at the time anyway. Here was the ideal incarnation of Bruce Wayne/Batman as played by the intense young Christian Bale. Gary Oldman was a happy surprise as a Jim Gordon not that far removed from the depiction out of the graphic novel \\"Batman: Year One\\". Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, a character from the Denny O'Neil comics, which was wonderful to see. Also included from the O'Neil years is the character Ra's al Ghul, and who better to portray an older yet sufficiently intimidating warrior than Liam Neeson? Finally, they cast Michael Caine, my favorite actor, as Wayne's loyal Butler Alfred. Add a fantastic version of the Scarecrow (aka Jonathon Crane) and my dream was realized. The movie was well filmed. The screenplay was intelligent and the source material taken seriously. By the end, I felt like I was watching the Batman onscreen for the very first time.<br /><br />Three years later The Dark Knight is released and presented probably Batman's greatest crime thriller put to film. Featuring a fully formed, terrifying Joker. I always thought Batman's arch enemy should not be so much \\"funny\\" as he should be scary as hell. And, as we all know by now, Heath Ledger succeeded beyond all expectations. He created one of the all time great movie villains. Factor in the central character of Harvey Dent (and a personal favorite villain Two-Face) and we have what many consider the greatest Comic Book movie of all time.<br /><br />Which is why Nolan's follow up had such high expectations. Everyone wondered how THE DARK KNIGHT RISES could top THE DARK KNIGHT. That was never a question for me. I never expect a sequel to top a prior film in order to be good, or even great. I expect it to be a good story. If Nolan had one more good Batman story left in him, I'd be one happy Bat fan!<br /><br />And did he ever!<br /><br />Nolan and the screenwriters decided the only way to make a third film was to conclude Batman's story. It's a stroke of genius. Whenever I review movies on Amazon I usually stray from synopses and plot points. This is primarily out of laziness and because I'm more excited about my general feelings regarding the film. I'll just say that eight years after the final moments of THE DARK KNIGHT, Bruce Wayne's body and spirit have been damaged. He's a recluse, leaving Alfred to take care of Wayne Manor and Fox to run Wayne Enterprises. Batman and Gordon have seemingly made Gotham City a better place, with less organized crime, yet it's only a facade. There's evil brewing underneath the streets of Gotham with a grand scheme to turn the city on it's head. This evil is led by an international terrorist known only as Bane. And caught in the middle is cat burglar Selina Kyle. Anne Hathaway is a thief alright as she steals every scene she's in. Sometimes Nolan's Batman films have been called too dark and serious, but I have to say Hathaway's Selina (let's call her what she is, Catwoman!) is one of the most fun characters to grace any Batman film. I admit I've never appreciated the character Bane in the comics. He seemed like such a conveniently brainy yet brawny bad guy. Plus Bane looks like a Mexican wrestler...which is just weird. So, while I don't want to say I was worried, I was curious why the filmmakers chose Bane of all characters to pit against Batman. Now I know. Given the story, the villain could only be Bane (well, perhaps not only, wink). Instead of tights and a wrestler's mask, Bane sports a military uniform, hulking muscles and a contraption on his face that allows him to breath painlessly. His mask intimidates and conjures slight recollections of Darth Vader. And Tom Hardy's Bane is an absolute force of nature. He is smart. He is strong. He's a field general and a soldier all his own...<br /><br />...and the initial confrontation between he and Batman is one of the greatest moments of any Batman film, certainly the most horrifying. I think it will be as classic as the Batman/Joker interrogation scene from THE DARK KNIGHT.<br /><br />As I've already given away, Bruce comes out of \\"retirement\\" to save Gotham once more. There's a heck of a lot to discuss regarding this film. There's all kinds of subtext and plot points and twists which I will leave alone. I will simply say that Bruce Wayne's journey in this film is (and perhaps has always been) about tragedy, triumph and sacrifice. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is epic. It's large scale. It covers a lot of ground. I've heard a few say there's not enough Batman and not enough fights. I must respectfully disagree. There's plenty of Batman and plenty of incredible action, with refreshingly few digital effects. There's also a lot of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne. And why shouldn't there be? This is Bruce Wayne's story. And while Wayne and Batman were always considered different personas in the previous Nolan films, both are closer than ever here. Batman and Bruce Wayne are almost one and the same this time around. This is not a continuity error. This is an indication that Wayne is no longer interested in carrying on the rich playboy public image. It seemshe's long since taken off that mask and has no intention of putting it back on. That's my take anyway. My point being while watching THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, I no longer felt I was only watching Bruce in some scenes or only watching Batman in others...it was always the same guy. Although the Batsuit is still really, really cool!<br /><br />While Bale has been excellent in the trilogy, he gives his best performance of the character in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. Freeman is solid, as always. Oldman is an older Gordon, also scarred emotionally from the events of the last film. Consequently, Oldman gives perhaps his best performance in a Batman film. Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are new additions to the series yet are critical to the plot and certainly leave a lasting impression. And, as you might expect, Michael Caine's Alfred provides the heart of this story. There is an emotional impact to THE DARK KNIGHT RISES that I've never experienced in a comic book movie. Caine is one of the reasons why. There is a heartbreaking speech by Alfred that feels so genuine one could have heard a pin drop between sniffles from the audiences around me.<br /><br />That's what makes this Bat film unique. I have nothing against the other fine comic book films out there. This year alone provided a couple of incredibly fun, fantastic superhero movies that I enjoyed tremendously. But when it's all said and done, they feel like sweet dessert to THE DARK KNIGHT RISES' steak dinner. Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy has given us substance, thrills, scares, twists and, with this final film, tears.<br /><br />People want to compare THE DARK KNIGHT RISES to it's predecessors. That's just not how I view Nolan's trilogy. All three films are critical by themselves. BATMAN BEGINS is the perfect Batman origin film. THE DARK KNIGHT is the perfect Batman crime drama. And THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is Batman's perfect finale. Together they make a phenomenal series and one of the greatest trilogies of all time.<br /><br />So...I can't tell you THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the best of the Batman films, but I can tell you it's my favorite. Maybe that will change one day and I'll decide it's THE DARK KNIGHT or BATMAN BEGINS. That's how much they mean to me. That's how thankful I am that Chris Nolan brought my Batman to life.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I can't really say anything negative or critical about The Avengers, but I sure can't give it more than 3 stars.  Yes, it was a special effects extravaganza. It was \\"fun\\" to watch most of the time. It was satisfying in many ways.  BUT, it lasted WAY too long. Two hours and twenty minutes is too dang long to sit through anything; The Avengers could have used a ruthless editing of at least 45 minutes of film. I caught myself wondering, \\"Will this thing ever end?\\"<br /><br />I couldn't figure out Scarlett Johansson's role in the scheme of things. What exactly was her \\"super-power\\" other than her ability to kick butt?  Was her casting just a fulfillment of a female part?  Neither Johansson nor her character worked in this film.<br /><br />Capt. America and Thor: Terrible actors. Painful to watch.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr./Ironman stole the show. Hawkeye was pretty awesome too.  And casting Ruffalo as the Hulk rather than Edward Norton was a smart move.<br /><br />Maybe I was tired and The Avengers was too much stimuli late in the evening. Hell, maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff. I mean, almost 700 Amazon reviewers can't be wrong, right?  All I know is, The Avengers just didn't grab me as I had hoped, and I was ready to cut it off after 90 minutes.

B0085Z8F4A|2.0|Apart from the opening sequence, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a 3D blu ray, even if you like the film.<br />As for the movie itself - I went into it without the expectations of it being an Alien prequel, but as a scifi movie made by probably one of the best directors of the genre out there. The plot, suspense and acting are all awful. About the only good thing about this is the special effects, but even they won't wow you.<br />For the amount this cost to make, you'd expect far better.<br />This will sit and collect dust.<br />For anyone looking for a good scifi, I recommend Moon. Cost nothing to make, keeps you gripped for 2 hours and is about $12 for the blu. I wasn't aware of it until I saw it on Crackle, but its very good.
B000002TQV|5.0|Superior listening experience.  Not a collection of songs, each track is unique, but carries a common style throughout.  Delicate melodies, inspiring choruses, performed with precision, not a wasted lyric or note.  Pure production quality, the music sound unfiltered and live.  The crescendos make this album stunning to me because they start from a basic melody, build in volume, power and complexity to a point where you think it could go further.  Yet continue to go bigger, and suddenly drop off, back to the beginning to a pause, then ramp up again.  The range of emotions in the vocals and lyrics: pain, sarcasm, anger, fear, and love.  It's all there, and oddly I hear it in each song.  Clearly a masterful performance.
B004P1JEWU|4.0|The first book in the series was a surprising, refreshing read. The second book I found to be a little dull and somewhat lacking in the adventure of the first book. This book was reminiscent of the first one with lots of action and a fast-paced story.<br /><br />The plots of all the characters progressed in this instalment and similar to previous books I found the story lines of Arya and Tyrion to be the most interesting. However, in this book, the stories of the other characters were just as engrossing, from Robb and Jon Snow to Dany and Sansa and even the Onion King, the vivid accounts of their lives amidst the chaos of war was riveting. There was almost a moratorium in the killing of characters but just when the reader is lulled into complacency, a number of main characters are killed off in quick succession. The twist regarding Robb was well played and while I almost expected it and I was also fervently hoping that I was wrong and that the events wouldn't transpire. However, even expecting something like that to happen I was still surprised at the manner in which it was executed and found it to be en excellent part of the story.<br /><br />Of course, the story ends of a cliff hanger and while I will be taking a break from the series I expect to return shortly and continue the adventure with...well...the characters that remain.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had heard talk of this book, but expected not to be as drawn in as i was. Will continue the series.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I think the key to enjoying this book is to not expect Harry Potter with adult content. There was always going to be huge pressure on JK Rowling to deliver the goods with her book after Harry Potter and I believe she has.<br /><br />The book opens with the death of a councilman of Pagford and proceeds to detail the events leading up to the election of a new councilperson. Making the events more interesting are the contentious issues surrounding the election and the consequences which will be felt depending on the standpoint of the newly elected councilperson. These issues include whether the much maligned Fields may remain part of Pagford and the closing of the addiction clinic. Interwoven into this are the personal stories of a myriad of characters, some of which are sympathetic and others which are somewhat loathsome. I found the plot engaging and incredibly interesting and I must commend the author for weaving together a cohesive tale with so many diverse characters and plots. The story of how one man's death can rip apart a community and cause simmering tensions to bubble over and ultimately result in catastrophe, force individuals to face up to their lot in their life and even in some instances unite characters makes for a powerful read.

I do wish some things weren't applied to be pinned, for example a company pinning their weightloss program and pinning it to every board so even if you are not looking on the health and fitness category you still see multiple pins from them... but that's not easily controlled I understand..
0316069353|3.0|I liked the book...but didn't thoroughly enjoy it.  The story line moved away from the traditional (and very well liked) world of LA Criminal Courts.  For example, Mickey Haller now handles foreclosure cases and takes the time and effort to open up a Van Nuys office.  To me this took away the pizaaaz of the 'Lincoln Lawyer.'  Also the end of 'The Reversal' leaves readers thinking that Bosch and Haller are going to start a brotherly relationship.  Ed Bosch's character was virtually absent in this story.  Overall, the story wasn't bad...or a horrible read...it was just disappointing in comparison to the others in this series.
B00914JWSW|3.0|If you're a Streisand fan you want to hear this and I'll almost certainly be picking up Release Me II when it is issued.  However, I think you'll enjoy the album a lot more if you approach it with realistic expectations.  This album is ok, but I think Streisand was right when she originally rejected these cuts.  In just about every song there is some little thing off in the arrangement or the vocal or the interpretation.  I can't always put my finger on it.  Streisand's great, but even she has her limitations which become quite clear with her version of the Jobim song \\"Lost in Wonderland\\" (aka \\"Antigua\\").  Perhaps the worse vocal I have ever heard from Streisand.  I had to quickly find another version of the song just to reassure myself that the problem was with the singer, not the song.  This is one selection that should have stayed in the can.  If you are a Streisand fan, but unfamiliar with Jobim I urge you not to be put off from his music by this one terrible recording.  He was one of the great composers of the 20th century and there are hundreds of wonderful recordings of his music.  Seek them out.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Claire Danes.  So many series have good to great acting, but Danes on Homeland is in her own universe.  Perhaps it's been said here before that CD was the actor the creators had in mind for Carrie from the beginning.  She goes in and out of Carrie's moods seamlessly.  One moment a pushy, obsessed CIA professional, the next a hair-flitting single woman yearning for love and intimacy.  Fortunately all of this skill accompanies a moody, disturbing, urgent story.  Television actors like Danes work so damn hard for their money, while eclipsing almost all of their A-list movie counterparts.

044022425X|5.0|Another action packed (and massive volume) in the Outlander saga. Anyone who loves historical romance fiction would love this very long story. The characters are very appealing. Some of the things I hoped would happen in the narrative do happen in this particular novel.  The series is packed with action and truly seems to be a window into the past. I am already reading the next one.<br />Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\"
B007HLIUN4|5.0|why nations fail? is an excellent book and explains in intimate detail the reasons behind the nations being powerful and rich.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|Definitely enjoyed this book!  Not only was the subject thought-provoking, there were a lot of historical examples used throughout the book that were also interesting.  Would recommend to all \\"thinkers\\" out there that are looking for a light and quick read.
0345803493|5.0|The trilogy..., in and of itself..., to me was a wonderful read.  I was told by a college classmate of mine who majored in English that it was a poorly written book.  I was listening to a talk radio show on a Saturday morning and they likened the book to abuse.  Oh BUT I..., I looked at the subliminal messages that the book entailed.  I learned a lot about sex and the different kinds of ways to enhance your sexual activity.  For me, this was indeed a good read and somewhat educational.  :-)

B0058YPILY|5.0|This is my favourite TV show!! I have already viewed all discs twice. Many of the episodes I did not get to see during regular seasons.<br />Very pleased with the quality of this product.

0525952926|5.0|I have been a fan of Ken Follett since I read  \\"Eye of The Needle\\" many years ago<br /><br />Having read Book 1 - The Fall of Giants, I looked forward to reading Winter of the World, and I was not disappointed.  The historical facts were accurate, and the families and their experiences were incredible.  The only problem, if it could be described as such,  was not wanting to stop reading it. The horrors and atrocities of war were described without glossing over the events, or becoming maudlin.  The foolish mistakes of politicians were handled appropriately by describing the incidents and how they reacted to them.<br /><br />I would say that reading Book  One is a requirement for reading Book Two, in order to get to know the families well, and understand their reactions and experiences.<br /><br />These books are classics , and I eagerly await the release of Book Three.

B005HSL626|1.0|I've tried this app on several different Android devices, even with different versions of Android, and it never makes it to the point of actually playing a game; it just freezes or force closes.  Maybe it only works on iPhoney devices or something.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|At first this is a great game and fun to play.  I would have given it 5 stars however you will run into problems/glitches in this game. It is a fun game that yes gives you plenty of energy to complete tasks at first but as you go along you have more tasks and run throughyour energy more quickly.  However every three minutes it gives you one free energy so you do not have to buy energy.  I just left the game and was given notification when my energy was recharged.  I encountered problems with not earning trophies for tasks/quests that I compete.  After reading the Q&A from the forum board I uninstalled and reinstalled the game like it States.  When you do this you will loose your entire game and have to start over on level one you also loose all the REAL MONEY in which you have spent in the game.  After I did the reinstall I am unable to log into Gameloft Live.  I have contacted the company twice with no live response only on automated computer response.  Needless to say I am worse of than I was before since I can not play with other friends on Facebook or Gameloft live and I can no longer complete so tasks/quests with out spending money or taking a long long time.  I am very disappointed by the lack of customer service as well other players state on the GameLoftforum.  It would be the best game I played if it did not have problem. I fell that Amazon should reconsider selling Gameloft Live products when they clearly do not have an active or big enough customer service department.
0765342294|5.0|I'd not heard of this book prior to looking through different Listmania science fiction lists.  I am so glad that I trusted other reviews to read this one.  Good storyline, characters, techy gadgets, with enough familiarity so as not to be a future history completely out of the realm of belief.  I hope you will read and enjoy Ender's Game.

B00364K6YW|4.0|If you saw the recent movie, this is a 1995 version that's very similar.  However it has seven 50 minute sessions, so that it can tell the story much better.<br /><br />Unlike the movie, the photography here is not as clear.  Washed out dark areas as you see with so many British imports to PBS.<br /><br />None-the-less, if you're a Jane Austin fan, you have to get this.  I don't know why that I, a mathematician/engineer, am so attracted to this silly story.  :)  Much more so than my English-major wife.<br /><br />BTW, I realized that I saw this on PBS a few years ago,<br /><br />Factoid from my wife:  an upper class British family living in these times could live comfortably with a servant or two on 100 pounds a year.  It was important to marry off your children to a person of means so that they could live comfortably.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found it very difficult to put down No Easy Day, and finished the book in just a couple of days. This is not because I wanted to know how the book ended, because anyone who doesn't know how the raid to capture OBL ended would have to have lived under a rock. It is also not because of the style of the book, because the literary style leaves something to be desired as is often the case for books written by a non-writer with the help of a co-author. Despite all this, the author manages to draw the reader into the world of a Navy SEAL after 9/11. Although the author is careful not to go into too much detail about Tactics Techniques and Procedures, the book will also appeal to those interested in special forces when it describes the planning for and the execution of the operation. The perspective of the book is vey much that of an operator, and it will be interesting to see whether any further publications appear to shed further light on the perspective of the decision-makers.
0060873175|4.0|Really flimsy plotting with cardboard characters to boot.  If you're familiar with regional Hawaiian dialects and colloquialisms you'll also find most of the vernacular usage cringe worthy.  With that said, I really enjoyed this posthumous Crichton release because it delivers a plethora of fantastic set pieces and scenarios faced by half-inch tall humans in the natural environs of Hawaii.  There's also a goodly amount of ick factor that one would expect when encountering gigantic ants, spiders, larvae, wasps, etc that will make your skin crawl.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just as her other books it was hard to put down . Not to spoil the ending for those of you who haven't read it. Justice prevailed in the end with a suspenseful ending.

B000FCKGPC|2.0|You will probably come to books 4 and 5 of A Song Of Fire And Ice expecting the books as good as Books 1 and 3. Or at least Book 2 (nobody expects much from \\"bridge\\" books so I don't think many were offended by #2). Won't you be disappointed.<br /><br />Frank Zappa had a fun term in the 60's and 70's for albums that were obviously inferior to the band's previous work, cranked out just to get the record company off the artist's back; he called it a \\"contractual obligation\\" album. Books 4 and 5 are almost the opposite and Book 5 should never have been written. The whole thing should have been wrapped up in Book 4.<br /><br />But the author succumbed to the lure of HBO money and so he strung out the series while lacking interesting material or story line, subjecting his readers to the worst sort of affliction any author can: boredom. Seriously, I felt like I was being punished by the end of the first third of Book 5. I had a heck of a time getting through the entire series (to date). Could 1800 or so pages (I have a Kindle so it's difficult to tell exactly) feel more like slow death? MY slow death?<br /><br />I guess Martin decided that replacing interesting story with sex was an acceptable strategy to fill the pages. This ramps up in each book after Book 1 as he runs lower on ideas. Let me tell you, it works as well in book form as it does in poorly written movies; sex and swearing takes the place of good plot and character development perfectly, doesn't it? That must be why movie attendance is continually dropping, the strategy DOESN'T work. At all. I'll bet a lot of viewers drop out during Season 4 and the series may be cancelled by Season 5.<br /><br />If you've read Books 1-3 just wait and go straight to Book 6. I guarantee you won't have missed much.

B009A3NGF4|5.0|As a huge fan of Mumford & Sons first album (Sigh No More), I was a little worried about a sophomore slump. Initial listen had me liking 2 songs and warm on the rest. Each day (and I have played it each day since release) I get more attached to the album. I find a different song stuck in my head at random times. I think that Babel will take its place alongside their first album as one of my favorite listens.

B001PB3RU8|4.0|I bought this album after listening to the previews here on Amazon, which I thought were good but in reality don't begin to capture how good the album really is.  I've listened to it several times and I'm at a loss for superlatives, this is truly one of the best albums I've heard in quite some time.  Each song is unique and the whole shows a range of musical craftsmanship that is both outstanding and impressive. I'd give it 4.5 stars, as I find \\"Kiss with a Fist\\" and \\"Girl with One Eye\\" to be the weak points, whereas virtually every other song is a standout, with \\"You've Got the Love\\" being my favorite.  I can't wait to pick up Ceremonials.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I found the book very interesting. Unbelievable strength & determination of the individuals going through the different stages of training to get to the point of risking their lives day after day.Certainly takes a special & dedicated person, hats off to you. Loved the book.
039456152X|5.0|I was raised on the movie Fried Green Tomatos and it wasn't until recently that I decided to read the book because I wanted some questions answered. Such as is Mrs. Threadgoode really Iggy? So I looked and found the book. I LOVED the book! It was just a wonderful and charming and for once beat my love for the movie. I will probably read the book again because it was just so wonderful. I found myself not being able to put it down.
0547995660|5.0|The Giver was a novel study book for my 6th grader son.  I enjoyed the book very much as I had to read it and discuss it with my son, as he had so many questions about the society and it's inhabitants.  My son is now grateful to live in a place where he actually can choose and decide for himself, make mistakes and learn from them.  I applaud Jonas for having had the courage to take baby Gabriel away before he got\\"released\\". What a brave Jonas!  I also enjoyed Gathering  Blue and Messenger. I  am now reading Son. I recommend parents to read this awesome book.  ( will there someday be a movie based on the Giver, Lowrey?)
1594135851|3.0|Okay I am not dis'ing on the Hunger Games what so ever, I'm actually a great fan of the books however; I didn't enjoy reading the third one as much as the first two. I feel like the author tried to put so much information in the third book that the plot got lost a lot of the time. By the time I finished it, I was glad I finished nothing like the other two where I still wanted to know more. But still this was a great book series to read.
0470449764|4.0|Good book for people who are not Engineering or Math majors.  Some wrong answers but overall good.  Explanations could be simpler but a good starting book for those wishing to get decent scores.
1577312082|5.0|The Power of Now, Wow.<br />This book is truly a gift from the CREATOR to all of us who ever have asked the questions, Why Im I here in this world? Why is there so much Hatred? Why am I not happy? This book explains every thing and the one thing we all need to know in order to free our selves from simply our self. This book is a way to freedom, finally I know I can stop searching now. Now it's time to do the work that's been layed out so simply Beautifully in this book from Heaven. I love the simplicity in how Eckhart Tolle takes you step by step through the process of dismantling all of the confusion that we've placed on our selves unknowingly. What you are left with after reading this book, I prefer the audio book for his voice seems to speaks directly to my heart, is simply no more EXCUSES. You either do the work that will set you free, or you can continue to do the work that will keep you in a form of self imprisonment. Let's not fool our selves,this world is a Beautiful place,The beauty represents the good in us. But it's the ugly that robs us and keeps us in fear. Thank God there is a way out, and you will be so amazed how simple it is after reading this wounderful book. It's time to clear the debris and reclam our whole true self back from this living dead state of mind into enlightment.
0062119044|3.0|The book was well-written, the characters well-developed and the plot riveting. The question remains, do you want this disturbing content in your brain? The images conjured cannot be forgotten. The disturbing relationships cannot be understood. I, for one, wish I'd never read this book. It doesn't positively contribute to my life nor give me something to emulate. Best to leave it unread, smoldering in its negativity.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! I use it on the computer as well, but I'd rather use it on my Kindle. I think it's easier on the Kindle. There are so many great diy ideas, recipes and so much more on pinterest. Definitely worth getting!
B008G12ERC|3.0|I love Muse's first few records, then Resistance started raising eyebrows with it's over-the-top derivative music which sounded too much like Queen wanna-bees.  The 2nd Law, which seemed so promising with Madness (although it stole shamelessly from George Michael's Faith, it was still a catchy song), is almost a parody.  The music seemed too campy at times, like something that Spinal Tap would've conjured up.  Matt needs to bring his music back down to earth!  There were a couple of beautiful songs (which sounded like something I heard before, but I can't place it), however in hindsight, I would've rather have just paid for those songs individually instead of buying the whole record.

B008FSCNTK|4.0|What can I say about Diana Krall that hasn't already been said. She's awesome! I know there's alot of debate over the album cover (which I love) but it is a statement to the to music contained within and it's origins. I think this is lost on many people that may not recognize the relationship. Anyway, my only negative statement woudl be that I think it could have been mixed better. I know it's meant to sound a little raw, but at times the instruments overpower her voice. Love this lady's voice.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book was advertised as Ms. Rowling's \\"first adult book\\".  While the subject matters were adult, I found the book was mostly centered around the teenagers' point of view and not from the adults...I was disappointed.  I was expecting an adult book about adult matters and centering around the adult characters.  I would not recommend this book to friends without explaining this point...If I had known what the book was really about, I would not have bought it.

1451696191|5.0|This book was excellent! I read this at the begging of September, and I could not put it down. The depth that the author goes in with Charlies feeling is astounding. The way the author has Charlie address us, who he is writing the letters to. We do not know who Charlie is, we do not know where he is either,all we know is what he tells us. Charlie is kind of an odd ball. He is very articulate and does not really have any friends. Because at the begging of the book Charlies best friend Michael has just died, and Charlie tells us about going through the funeral. The book starts at the begging of Charlies freshman year in high school. He loves his parents and family and his brother and sister. He is lonely and completely and totally socially awkward. But then his older cousin takes him to a party, and his whole world changes, and he fall in love, but things don't turn out how you would think, but it was a great book, so Read it!!!!!

1423140605|5.0|If you're picking up Mark Of Athena, it's highly unlikely you'll be doing so fresh - which means you must have read and loved all the books that have come before, whether they were about Percy Jackson, the Kanes or the Heroes of Olympus. Whatever the case may be, you're likely on the lookout for myth master (as his publicity would have it) Rick Riordan's characteristic mix of gods, monsters and demigods, spiced with action, snarky humour and heart.<br /><br />Astoundingly, Riordan doesn't disappoint. For the third book in an ongoing series (which usually suffers from exposition-heavy get-to-the-point-alreadyness), Mark Of Athena is perhaps the most plot-rich, action-packed installment for the Heroes of Olympus thus far. The novel chronicles the adventures of the seven demigods of the new Great Prophecy as they make their way across the bedevilled Mare Nostrum (the Mediterranean Sea) to actual Rome. Along the way, our seven heroes meet all manner of (you guessed it) gods and monsters as they puzzle out the trap awaiting them in Rome and Percy's girlfriend Annabeth tries desperately to figure out the millennia-old mystery that cloaks the solitary task her mother Athena has laid out for her.<br /><br />It's a huge, ambitious undertaking, and Riordan - against all odds - somehow manages to pull it off with aplomb. The viewpoint chapters alternate among four of the seven demigods (Percy, Annabeth, Piper and Leo), and they move the tale along at Riordan's standard brisk clip.<br /><br />The wealth of story Riordan has managed to build up in this universe continues to amaze. There's so much lore and history packed into the novel, and Riordan mines his killer premise - the gods of Olympus are now torn schizophrenically between their Greek and Roman incarnations - to great effect. The story of Athena is particularly affecting, as Annabeth finds her Greek war goddess mother still reeling from her displacement in history and status by the conquering Romans. Whether it's strictly accurate as a re-telling of history is up for debate and up to you to decide for yourself. What can't be denied is that Riordan has woven a thrilling, intriguing tapestry against which his narrative can play out in grand style.<br /><br />Don't worry if your favourite aspect of Riordan's books has always been the fun, tongue-in-cheek way he treats both his own literary creations as well as the historical figures ot myth and legend he's co-opted into his universe. Even in the midst of high adventure and near-death scenarios, Riordan peppers the proceedings with his trademark brand of sweet, irreverent wit - Percy, for example, continues to insult Dionysus (the wine dude, I mean, god), whatever incarnation the latter is currently sporting, and it's fun to see that play out through the eyes of another character.<br /><br />There's a sense here too that the characters are growing up alongside their target audience. Riordan has never shied away from themes of emotional sacrifice and loss, but those notions are front and centre now, echoing heavily in the thoughts and actions of his young protagonists. For a series so squarely focused on action adventure, there's a fair bit of introspection and soul-searching as well, which provides welcome insight into these boys and girls who should be flitting about their teenage lives instead of risking life and limb to save the world from an awakening menace who animates the very earth they walk upon.<br /><br />If Mark Of Athena suffers from anything, it's an over-abundance of plot - the adventures flash past so quickly that there's hardly time to soak them all up. The selfish, demanding fan in me would prefer that Riordan expand and deepen his characters' conflicts (both internal and external). I suppose it's refreshing to complain for once that the author could well afford to be more rather than less indulgent! (And it's unfair to bellyache, really, since his narrative brevity and self-restraint is something I've always greatlyadmired in his Percy Jackson series.)<br /><br />At times, the story also strains a little beneath the restraints that have been placed upon it by the narrative technique - there's less insight than I'd like into Hazel, Jason and Frank, of course, which you would expect since they're more or less bystanders in this particular novel. But sometimes the story being told doesn't quite fill up the chapters set aside for the particular character who's currently taking centre stage. In the end, the various plot threads do coalesce satisfyingly into the larger whole, but this does nevertheless mean that some sections of the book feel flatter and more forced than others.<br /><br />That being said, Mark Of Athena remains a towering achievement and one of the best new books I've read this year. It ends on a cliffhanger worse than any the Heroes Of Olympus series has inflicted on us thus far - eliciting the response that is now standard from me every October: \\"I have to wait a YEAR for the next book?!?\\" Untoward.admired in his Percy Jackson series.)<br /><br />At times, the story also strains a little beneath the restraints that have been placed upon it by the narrative technique - there's less insight than I'd like into Hazel, Jason and Frank, of course, which you would expect since they're more or less bystanders in this particular novel.

B007TK77QE|3.0|I have never read a JK Rowling book in my life (Harry Potter just didn't appeal to me) and I was curious to read a book by the author. The book is a slow burn.  The first half of the book introduces the reader to the characters, most of whom are hard to like. I continued to read the book as it was quite an easy read and suddenly found myself gripped and couldn't put it down. The issues highlighted in the book are a sad reflection on society and all our petty prejudices, however, a few of the characters manage to transcend the hopelessness portrayed in a few of the characters narratives.  I enjoyed the book - but it's not life changing.  The best part is that I can now say that I have read a JK Rowling book!!

0307744434|5.0|This book was a wonderful surprise.  I had no idea what it was about and had not read any reviews on it.  It was unlike any book I've read before and was so beautifully done.  The writing was phenomenal and painted a magical picture of the different elements of this special circus.  It reminded me of how I felt after seeing Cirque du Soleil's \\"O\\" in Las Vegas, where the costumes and colors and interactions were so beautiful that I wouldn't have even cared if there were gymnastics.  Just so beautiful to see, and that's what this book was to me. I keep recommending this book to everyone I know.  I can't wait to see what follows this, but it will have huge shoes to fill in my mind.  I know I will be reading this one again.

B007N3A2F0|5.0|Dont understand all the negative reviews, but I guess you can't argue taste.  Seems some folks want every album to sound the same.<br /><br />This album is, in my opinion, the culmination of everything I have always loved about sonata arctica.  There's old school power metal (losing my insanity), listener-friendly mid-tempo stuff (I have a right; only the broken hearts), emotional sweepers (The Day, Dont be mean), grinding rippers (somewhere close to you, Cinderblox), and epic blistering masterpieces (Wildfires II-III).  Tons of great riffs and heaviness strewn about on this one!<br /><br />There are a couple songs I could give or take (Shi*load of money, Alone in heaven), but nevertheless a complete album that you can listen to from start to finish without having to yawn through some stinkers.  Its not as one-dimensional as Ecliptica or Silence, yet not as disjointed and random as Unia/Days of Grays.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I really dig every Sonata album to date but I love the way SGHN seems to blend all elements of the past into a great, cohesive album. Plus, the use of classic instruments throughout like the banjo, fiddle and piano is sweet.  And Tony has never sounded better or shown more vocal range.<br /><br />Probably ranks in my top three Sonata albums (along with Winterhearts and Ecliptica).  So nice to see these guys get stronger and continue to grow musically...most groups by the 7th album are mere shells of their former self.<br /><br />Simply put: an excellent hard rock/heavy metal album.  Highly recommended to Sonata fans!

0345803485|2.0|1) I had to read this because all my friends recommended it 2) I did enjoy parts of it and finished book one 3) I think what I took away from it was the fact that I did not like how Christian IS *such a bad guy* yet she makes an exception.<br /><br />He's shady, abusive and not what a \\"good guy\\" is supposed to look like.... and hunny if he's not what a good guy is supposed to look like--- then he isn't one!<br /><br />I don't plan on reading the 2nd or 3rd book. You know why? Because I don't WANT to like him.<br /><br />Doesn't anyone remember having that girlfriend - who has a dodgy boyfriend and she keeps justifying his actions, making excuses for him, blowing off her friends and family for him... and finally she's convinced herself that he treats her that way because he has \\"commitment issues\\" or \\"problems\\" or is \\"busy\\", and it turns out HE IS JUST SHADY?<br /><br />This book gives the impression that if you dabble with someone like this, in the end he will actually be NICE and SWEET and a good guy- NOT<br /><br /> The reality is that isn't necessarily true... I don't think this book should be read by teen girls, not simply because of the sexual content ( I'm pro-free speech!) but because the main character keeps giving into what she KNOWS is wrong for her....<br /><br /> And SURE we've all been there... haha-right.... and tell me how did that end up for you?? :-)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great fun game to play!  i always run late in getting the latest games and/or version out in the market.  But man 'o man is it Sooo worth it once you get around to downloading what's out there. Enjoy!
0316228532|5.0|i got this book really quickly .. i am a super fan of JK ROWING in harry potter of course. but this one is also what i'm looking for~<br /><br />although many bookstore has a 20% or 30% discount. the price is still lover than them~<br /><br />got them quickly
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I probably would never have read this book on my own but since it was my book group's pick for this month, I had to.  I haven't finished it and probably never will.  It's not my style.  Sorry.  I think that the author is a very talented \\"visual\\" author.  I could easily see many portions of the book in my mind and we spoke about the possibility of it being a movie, but that's not enough to get me to finish the story.  Just begin the book and you'll figure out the ending.
0800141660|5.0|This special edition of Sense and Sensibility is the best version of the Jane Austen tale I've ever seen and is simply the best version of this particular version with Emma Thompson.  I had a cut version of this but after seeing this edition, which is uncut, I had to discard the first and buy this one.
B007TK77QE|1.0|Surely the English people have not become as sickening, hateful and archaic as J K Rowling describes?  The personalities in this book are full of decadent thoughts and actions, with very few redeeming characteristics.  I found each character hard to believe, which spoilt this story for me.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love this version.  I've been waiting years to treat myself to this DVD, and I am thrilled with it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is addicting... My husband and I have just about got all of the puzzel pieces... We haven't had any problems at all with this app!!
B00364K6YW|5.0|This uncut and restored edition is the best version of Pride and Prejudice I've ever seen, and I think I've seen them all.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is ok. but it needs some more varieties. I like a few of the games but most of them are too difficult even for me.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Wow! Never knew where this was going even at the end.  I have read all three books now and only on the last book do you finally start to see the bigger picture.  If you loved The Hunger Games, READ THIS!!!  I am currently reading The Kill Order.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is the most challenging game for Chess. You can set your own pace and the timer keeps track of how long it takes to make your move. Be smart or you will get beaten.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|This is one of two good movies with Modana.  She is funny and entertaining and wish she could make more comedy movies.  I don't know if I can write 20 words regarding this movie or anything else about her career.  She is famous for inventing her image and many popular artists of this day are following in her footsteps of invention and becoming successful performers.  I hope this meets with your approval.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I found only 1 bug. and it needs the other blocks and WORKING Tnt so it is a little bit to much but I still like it
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|What with the big Hollywood names recruited to this caper picture, I was expecting much more out of TOWER HEIST. I figure when you rope in the likes of Matthew Broderick, Eddie Murphy, Ben Stiller, and T&eacute;a Leoni, that you're in for sensational stuff. But TOWER HEIST is okay, just okay. It should've been more.<br /><br />In a brilliant bit of counter-casting, Alan Alda plays the heavy. Alan Alda, who is such a nice guy that, next to him, Norman Rockwell is a piker. Alda plays unscrupulous Wall Street kingpin Arthur Shaw (ranked #138 on the Forbes 400 list), a man so self-satisfied he's got Steve McQueen's original 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Luso on wanton display in his swank penthouse. But there's no crime against smugness. Except that Arthur Shaw is also an embezzler, a swindler so slimy he's been running the Ponzi scam on those what had been diligently staffing the New York luxury apartment high-rise in which he resides. Alan Alda is pretty spectacular in his heel turn.<br /><br />What's that phrase? Never crap where you eat? When the Tower's wound-up building manager Josh Kovacs (Stiller) learns that Shaw had cleaned out his work force's pension funds and investments, he concocts a plan to break into Shaw's penthouse and crack his safe. To pull off the heist, he engages the services of a crew of losers and underdogs, including an evicted math whiz (Broderick), the daughter of a Jamaican safecracker (Gabourey Sidibe), a low-rent street hood (Murphy), and a tech \\"expert\\" (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) who took an online electrical engineering course at the DeVry Technical Institute. I guess the Three Stooges weren't available.<br /><br />I did like the character dynamics. Even though Stiller's schtick is more suited to his playing the put-upon target of fate, he pulls off his mastermind role while retaining his trademark quirks. And, frankly, it's just nice to see Eddie Murphy go back to his roots and channel his edgier side. But the film criminally underutilizes Matthew Broderick and T&eacute;a Leoni (who plays the FBI agent on the case).<br /><br />The Tower - refusing to own up to the missing \\"Trump\\" in the middle - flaunts a sophisticated seucrity system and is, to boot, guarded by a complement of FBI agents (because the G-Men had finally caught wise to Arthur Shaw and had placed him under house arrest pending his trial). So, yes, another impediment facing our amateur crooks is that the target site is always inhabited by Shaw. Anyway, cue the time-honored montage in which the crew cases the joint and identifies the obstacles. Cue also the internal infighting and fall-outs. And cue the last-minute swerves and then watch as our hapless squad tries to adapt. Props, by the way, to the funky cool theme score. It's very reminiscent of the theme songs from those 1970s caper films (THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 comes to mind).<br /><br />Given that Kovacs and his squad are woefully unschooled in the art of taking what's not yours, I'm still bothered at how weak their execution was, and how lame the idea behind the heist itself was, to begin with. Writer Ted Griffin slavishly follows the mechanics of the heist film, and the shocks he injects - as the heist naturally goes horribly off the rails - won't have anyone suddenly gripping their armrest. At least the experienced cast gets to dabble with comic chemistry, and so we're treated to amusing scenes in which Murphy, Stiller, and Broderick interact. Imagine how much better they could've been if only they were working with superior material? Sucks that, ultimately, the rallying theme of the little guys versus the big, bad crook is undercut by the slick but impersonal tone the film generates. TOWER HEIST will entertain you; it goes down easy. But, two days later, you'll probably have forgotten about it.<br /><br />Okay, I love movie quotes, and three quotes have stuck in my brain: \\"I never saw an episode of Matlock... where the criminal banged Matlock.\\" (Broderick's remark when he thinks Stillerand Leoni are acting too chummy); \\"We stick to the plan. We go on Snoopy.\\" (Stiller's cue for his crew to spring into action); and, lastly, Leoni's outburst when she catches sight of that Ferrari.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- 2 Alternate Endings: \\"15 Months Later\\" (00:00:37 seconds) & \\"Lester's Bar\\" (00:01:50 minute)<br />- 9 Deleted/Alternate Scenes (totaling 00:05:58 minutes)<br />- Gag Reel (00:04:18 minutes)<br />- Plotting TOWER HEIST: 7 behind-the-scenes featurettes (totaling 00:47:19 minutes)<br />- Audio Commentary by director Brett Ratner, editor Mark Helfrich and co-writers Ted Griffin & Jeff Nathansonand Leoni are acting too chummy); \\"We stick to the plan. We go on Snoopy.\\" (Stiller's cue for his crew to spring into action); and, lastly, Leoni's outburst when she catches sight of that Ferrari.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- 2 Alternate Endings: \\"15 Months Later\\" (00:00:37 seconds) & \\"Lester's Bar\\" (00:01:50 minute)<br />- 9 Deleted/Alternate Scenes (totaling 00:05:58 minutes)<br />- Gag Reel (00:04:18 minutes)<br />- Plotting TOWER HEIST: 7 behind-the-scenes featurettes (totaling 00:47:19 minutes)<br />- Audio Commentary by director Brett Ratner, editor Mark Helfrich and co-writers Ted Griffin & Jeff Nathanson
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love using pinterest. So when I got it on my Kindle Fire, I was extremely disappointed to not be able to use it half the time. it always freezes and I have to force close the app. If the problem was resolved I'd give it a 5. Until then, I will have to keep reopening the app a million times before it actually functions like it is supposed to.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's great for busy people. I love it because its simple and there are a lot of plans to choose from.
B008476HBM|5.0|It is the first book I happened to read on my Kindle. I was afraid the quality may be bad, for it was among the cheap or free classics. It is not the case, the format is very enjoyable. Concerning the book, its fame is sufficient to make clear how nicely written it is. That is definitely  the kind of book that make me really enjoy the english language.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the building of the relationship between Ana and Christian. The thing that bothered me most was Ana got a little whiny.
B007SGM084|5.0|Romantic novel that speaks to complexity of a relationship and physical desire without being vulgar.  The full trilogy is a must read -- hoping author writes a similar series with different characters and deeper relationship.
B005LAII08|3.0|Big Pixar dork. This was impressive to watch at the show, just not a great script is all. Which is a big deal to me, personally.
B0058YPL66|4.0|This show is well-written, well-acted, and brings new twists while retaining the fundamental truths of the original fairy-tale characters we all grew up loving. Couple of the deleted (heart-breaking) scenes included in this set should have remained in television show. Second season (Sundays on ABC at 8E/9C ongoing now) hints to more action, new characters, deeper character growth...can hardly wait to Season 2 collection.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Works well. Only seeking new calculator because one aspect of droid app regularly bugs me (that a new calculation does not clear previous and must press and hold &quot;clear&quot; to work). This app could be a little better, but very good.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I found this book interesting, with a few twists I didn't expect.  My 12 year old grandson has finished reading the trilogy and found it very interesting.  At first I thought it would be too strong for him, then I watched the evening NEWS!<br />[[ASIN:B005EGXTEE The Hunger Games (Hunger Games Trilogy)]]
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book has exceeded my expectations. A nice blend of history and comedy.  The main character is a lesson of humility, trust, simplicity, forgiveness, and adventure.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I felt an awful lot of this book could have been contained in the second book of the Trilogy, \\"Catching Fire\\". It's not really a problem for younger readers, but as a grandfather I thought it really strung things out.[[ASIN:B003XF1XOQ Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]
B000IZA9OE|5.0|Has to be one of the awesomest things South Park has ever done. I usually don't buy movies to keep, but I defiantly had to get this. Funny, offensive, violent, everything a movie needs. I must have watched it 20 times already. :D
B0000042GM|5.0|Julius Katchen is a truly remarkable pianist to perform all of Brahms' piano works with such dynamic contrast in such a musical and stylistic manner. An excellent recording, highly recommended.
B000OXHRRC|3.0|\\"A Good Year\\" is about a driven and competitive stockbroker (Russell Crow) who has inherited his uncle's vineyard and villa in France. He lives a fast paced lifestyle in London and saves no time for \\"holiday\\". However, his uncle who raised him (as he is an orphan)dies, he must return to France to make arrangements to sell villa. The movie flashes back and forth as to memories he reflects on when he lived with his uncle. While he is in France he meets a woman who he tries to woo unsuccessfully at first as she is reluctant to engage into a relationship. There is also a young woman who claims she is the daughter of his uncle. The movie basicaly revolves around these three events: present day, memories, and the woman he is interested in. The acting is excellent by all. It is a sweet movie with a small twist at the end. It has humor, romance and beautiful scenery. An added bonus is listening and watching Russell Crow speak French to the woman he is enamoured with. Like liquid sensuality. If you are interested in something not too fast paced, bloody, or action packed, this would be the movie to rent. Just something to cuddle up with, with your favorite beverage, relax and enjoy. I only gave 3 stars as it did seem slow in a few spots, but not too bad. The great acting makes up for it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This whole trilogy is great!<br />I cant put them down! The only books ive been able to sit down and fully read and enjoy. Never a dull moment with these two.<br />A must read
0525953728|4.0|No matter how much they pay these guys, it's not enough.<br /><br />And having a \\"normal\\" life seems a very unlikely prospect. Excerpt: \\"It isn't smart for me to get too much into families for security reasons, but it is also dishonest to make you think we didn't have them. We had wives, kids, girlfriends, ex-wives, and parents and siblings all vying for our time. We tried to be good fathers and spouses, but after years of fighting the war it was hard to be present even when we were at home.\\"<br /><br />The true story takes us through the Navy SEAL training and many of the deployments to the most dangerous places in the world. Intense training and practice first, then subdued concentration and forced rest while on hours-long flights to their location are repeated over and over. Then they walk miles up mountains to their destination under the cover of the night, or they sit crammed so close together on a helicopter that legs fall asleep, waiting to fast-rope down on top of the enemy. Attack their target, take them out, grab evidence, get out of there, alive if possible, and return to their base. These steps are repeated mission after mission, year after year, for 10 years or more, all with no fanfare, no welcoming committee, no celebrations on their return. And they cannot even talk about it with their families or friends. Just leave for a few days of work, then return.<br /><br />The SEALS considered themselves lucky to be assigned to the Osama bin Laden mission. This was the type of work they had trained their whole life for, and while they realized how dangerous it was, they were committed from the instant they were first selected. The political process was sometimes more frustrating than the actual mission: \\"Why haven't we heard anything yet?\\" I said. \\"It doesn't make any sense that it takes this long to make a decision.\\"  \\"Dude, it's Washington,\\" he said. \\"Does anything make sense?\\"<br /><br />The easy-reading story takes us through almost newspaper-reporting descriptions of several missions prior to bin Laden. Then we follow the team into bin Laden's compound, the crash of Mark Owen's helicopter where he was certain he was about to die as the helicopter hit, and the switch to mission mode as they realized they were on the ground and still alive and intact due to the skill of their pilot. No day is ever easy and luck plays a large role.<br /><br />We should be extremely thankful that we have such dedicated men in the Navy SEALS protecting our great country. We must be ever vigilant that no politician ever treats this force that stands between our freedom and our enemies with anything less than the utmost respect and care they deserve.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0741420570 For Honor: An Adventure of What Might Have Been: Book One of By Honor Bound]]scriptions of several missions prior to bin Laden.

B007THA4FI|4.0|The Casual Vacancy is a very interesting story about the interactions between people.  J. K. Rowling gets into the minds of her characters, and does an excellent job of showing the characters point of view.  The story is about what actually happens to real life people and the games they play between themselves.  This book is a wonderful read, and it can teach you so much about the interaction between different social statuses of people, the goodness and the evil mischievousness.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent insight into the training and dedication of our elite military units.  As a military wife and mother I found this very telling in the time consuming, repetitive and intense training needed to prepare our soldiers for difficult and demanding assignments.  It showed the strength of the bond of brotherhood our service members feel and brought home to me the need of space, thankfulness and appreciation but not smothering that they need when they come home.  They have a special service family that should be respected and appreciated and not felt competitive to.  These are the men and women that keep them alive and they need to return home to us.  Thank you for a job well done for our country and for the world at large of eliminating such evil from our planet.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Read Name of the Wind and WMF on a recommendation from my son. I was surprised at how well it read. I'm waiting anxiously to see how it all turns out in Book 3. 5 stars!
B007THA4FI|2.0|It was very overated. I did not enjoy enjoy reading it. I only finished it because I spent money to buy it.
B00006ADD5|5.0|David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia may be 50 years old (as of 2012), but it stands the test of time like all truly great works.<br /><br />The movie details T.E. Lawrence's experiences as a British liaison who inspires the Arab revolt against Turkish rule during World War 1 (1916-1918).<br /><br />At 3 hours and 47 minutes this is a LONG movie but somehow strangely hypnotic. The awesome music plays a huge part in this effect.<br /><br />If you're weary of the moronic approach of too many modern films (too much CGI and roll-your-eyes action, etc.) Lawrence of Arabia is the perfect antidote.<br /><br />It's mainly the story of a European man who sheds his stuffy \\"civilized\\" upbringing to revel in a new-found freedom in the desert wilderness as he integrates with the Arabs and basks in their glowing acceptance. He accomplishes this by, first, disregarding his superior's orders and honestly relating to the Arabs and, second, by proving himself unbiased to any specific tribe and willing to risk everything in helping them to defeat the Turks.<br /><br />Those spoiled by modern blockbusters won't likely appreciate Lawrence of Arabia but those who crave true artistic cinema will revel in it.
0525952926|5.0|This is a  \\"can't put it down, not going to get any sleep until I finish it\\" type of book. I did need a very brief review of the end of FALL OF GIANTS to update myself on where it ended... but the ultimate would be to have all three books available to read one after the other. The characters are so real; if one has any knowledge of the history at the time, the other stories fit right in, creating a cohesive whole. I can't wait for Book Three !
B0091574VI|1.0|Story would better serve as a documentary on animal planet. Not much detail and a sudden ending. Glad I didn't pay a theater price to see it.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was light and entertaining and a very quick read.  Perfect for relaxed cottage reading.
B0000CDLC8|4.0|For a LIVE 1972 recording the sound is excellent - 24 bit stereo and surround!!!  Essential for hardcore fans.  Recommended for fans but way too expensive with a little bit of relief from the fact it is a two disc set.  Good luck on this one before becomes it's a whoops it got away title.
B008MM9630|5.0|While by no means does this app break any new ground, it does provide an enjoyable use for spare time. Relaxing with charming graphics and design. I find it worth a couple bucks to buy some gems and help keep the game devs in shoes and pizza.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|This wonderful movie touched me to the core, especially the scenes where Gandhi was thrown off the train, burned the passes in spite of a vicious beating, and lay down on the ground with his fellow protesters in front of charging horses. The other actors in the film are also superb, especially the actress who played his wife. Gandhi's message to choose self-respect has stayed with me long after I finished watching the film.

B00457X7XQ|5.0|Wonderful story that presents a thrilling series of events.  Mark Russinovich has a great understanding of the computer security world.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I was hooked on this series after reading Bared to You which set the scene.  Reflected in You is an amazing story and brilliantly written.  The underlying storyline is completely compelling and kept me enthralled. Yes the image of Gabriel and the sex scenes are all very tantalising but the characters' vulnerability and determination was what really drove the story for me.  Can't wait to read Entwined in You!
B009329ZF2|5.0|It's really awesome for navy fans like me.<br />I seldom watch movies. But this one is special, I have been waiting for if for half one year and today I finally get it!!!<br />Welcome to my model-ship homepage: [...]
B007THA4FI|5.0|Wow - I thought this was a powerful book.  Since I've never read any of the Harry Potter stories, I was curious to read something by J.K Rowling.  It is not easy to get into - there are so many characters to keep track of.  I finally had to resort to writing down a list of characters - something I haven't done since \\"War and Peace and all those Russian names - but the list really helped.  The other reviewers have covered the plot - a small English town full of politics and dysfunctional families.  But what a plot Rowling can weave.  Some of it is so realistic as to be hard to take - particularly the bullying of teenagers (my least favorite part) but I quickly became engrossed in the characters and stayed up very late last night to find out what happened to them all.  I plan to read parts of it again.  If you like a good story with many characters and excellent writing, I can definitely recommend this book.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I watched it almost all the way through -- it had promise & on that, I kept watching. But alas, i fell asleep & tried to reconnect at that point that I did. But couldn't. I would have been very disappointed if I paid the movie price; but at the $3.99 price -- I can live with that. No fancy mojo on the who, what, when, where, why this movie didn't make it. I'm just glad I didn't pay more than I did. And, fwiw: part of it was okay, until I fell asleep....zzzzzz.
0439023521|3.0|This is a pretty good book. I'm not going to be a spoiler and say the book, but I'll say about the new binding. VERY GOOD CONDITION. I LOVED THIS BOOK. GREAT BINDING. I would get this for a easy, reading that you could finish in about 1 week
0307592731|1.0|Disappointing and annoying.  I wanted more about the PCT and the high Sierras, less about her on-and-on self-pity-party.  She's not a likable nor admirable character, and the book is too much about her issues, and the monotony of her reiteration of off-the-trail self-absorption. The sex angle was overdone, more creepy than interesting, and seemed to be inserted to make this sell as a paperback.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is nothing like the x box version. It gives you unlimited blocks and there is no way to use the chest, crafting table, or the furnace. There isn't diamonds as far as I know. The ONLY thing you can do is build.
B005S9ELM6|5.0|It's hard to believe it's already been 33 years since the Iran hostage crisis, and Ben Affleck's \\"Argo\\" makes it seem like it's all happening now. Chris Terrio's script, based on the memoirs of CIA agent Antonio J. Mendez, has the urgency of today's headlines. This true story of how Mendez (Affleck), working with a real-life Hollywood producer (Alan Arkin) and special effects wizard (John Goodman), created a ruse to get six American diplomats out of Tehran is amazing stuff, and Affleck keeps us on the edge of our seats, with very few sequences that lag even slightly.<br /><br />In its urgency and topicality, \\"Argo\\" is reminiscent of \\"Charlie Wilson's War.\\" In its breathtaking suspense in recreating an historical incident whose outcome is well-known, it resembles \\"Apollo 13.\\" This is high praise indeed, and totally deserved. Affleck gives a solid, sympathetic performance as Mendez (he also looks great in his hippie hair and beard, once you get over the initial shock). Even more, he fulfills the abundant promise as a director that he demonstrated in his first two films, \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" and \\"The Town.\\" (Interestingly, one of \\"Argo's\\" producers in George Clooney, another leading man who became a fine director.) Affleck assembled a wonderful crew, including photographer Rodrigo Prieto, editor William Goldenberg, composer Alexandre Desplat and production designer Sharon Seymour. He also has wonderful actors: Arkin and Goodman give delightful, Oscar-worthy comic performances, and there is also fine work by Bryan Cranston as Mendez's boss, Victor Garber as the Canadian ambassador, and literally dozens of others. (The end credits demonstrate that the actors playing the American diplomats bear an astonishing resemblance to the historical characters they play.) Clean, swift, and straightforward, \\"Argo\\" is a state-of-the-art historical/political thriller.
0316228532|5.0|After reading so many negative reviews, I approached this book with a bit of trepidation, wanting simply to put a toe in the water by reading the first few pages. What I found was one of the most engrossing pieces of literary composure of our time.<br /><br />It's a small story, about a small town with petty problems and petty people.  What makes it genius is Rowling's unassailable ability to pen full, wholly drawn characters, complete with insecurities, faults and flaws, but also with hope and optimism, and do it all with the tiniest of gestures.  (At one point, early on, she describes a character, Samantha, as finding her husband increasingly absurd and dull, yet occasionally appreciating his pomposity in precisely the same spirit as she likes, on formal occasions, to wear a hat - sometimes it's just appropriate.)<br /><br />There's no hero and no villain - only many people who are in short: human.

I really don't get all of these super negative reviews on it for the Kindle Fire, because for me it worked fine! I Love This App!
B003BWERF8|5.0|It is most unfortunate that Apple Corp did not include blue tooth technology on their expensive Classic Ipods.  This forced me to purchase the blue tooth adapter.  It worked as soon as I plugged it into the Ipod and linked to sound box up to 300 feet away. I am well satisfied.

1936608898|5.0|I cannot begin to tell you have life changing this has been for me.<br /><br />I have struggled with dieting for the last 15 years.  I tried Weight Watchers and lost 11 entire pounds in 6 months-- and had to deal with the constant \\"You must be doing something wrong...\\"  \\"Clearly, you aren't tracking your points...\\"  Yes, I was .<br /><br />I had lost weight in my mid-30's through diet and exercise, but I never got to my goal.  I had another kid.... turned 40... and nothing that I did seemed to help.<br /><br />I did Crossfit over the summer which introduced me to Paleo.  I had a few friends that had switched to a more Paleo type diet.  Although they hadn't lost a lot of weight, they spoke of their energy, better sleep habits, clear skin, etc.  I thought they were crazy- why would I do this if not to lose weight?<br /><br />Well, here I am 7 weeks later and I am sold.<br /><br />I am 42.  I am on the line between obsese and overweight.  I exercise.  I ate a \\"healthy\\" diet- never more than 1500 calories a day.<br /><br />Even though they said not to track calories- I did.  For three weeks.  Then it became apparent- I was eating more, exercising less and the weight was falling off.  More importantly, the inches were coming off.  It looked and felt like someone had put a pin in me and the air is slowly coming out.  No joke.<br /><br />I am in sizes now that I wore at 20 lbs less than where I am now.<br /><br />I was NEVER hungry.<br /><br />I ate until I was full.  I relearned what full was.<br /><br />My skin is incredibly soft.  My acne, which I never had until my 30's, is clearing up and nearly gone.  I sleep 7-8 hours a night- straight through. I have a ton of energy.  My mental acuity has improved.<br /><br />Oh- and I lost 13 pounds in a month and am continuing to lose about 2-3 pounds a week.  But like my friends who talked to me about this, that's the smallest part of this.<br /><br />I used to say I didn't feel fat, I felt bloated.  I don't feel bloated any more.<br /><br />The first few days- almost the whole first week- were MISERABLE.  I was mean.  I felt sick.  I fell asleep at 9 pm.  Then on Day 6, my skin was glowing.  I had energy.  I was sold.<br /><br />You do have to prepare for this and put in some effort.  Use the master recipes in the back (trust me- I love to cook and I ran out of ideas).<br /><br />The other thing that I found incredibly fascinating was that my taste completely changed.  After my 30 days, I tried to eat an Oreo and almost threw up- it tasted like licking the fat off a cold roast.  No joke.  Today is my husband's birthday and I couldn't eat the cake from the supermarket.  And ice cream tastes like scoops of sugar.  It's amazing.  It's like suddenly I can taste every preservative in everything- it's bizarre.<br /><br />I don't see going \\"off\\" this any time soon.  I did the 10 day test after, to see what I reacted to-- pretty much everything except rice.  Some things (like wine) are worth it, most of it isn't.<br /><br />What kept me going through the first week was the comment in the book that if you do have a serious reaction, keep at it because it means this is your issue.  It was definitely mine.<br /><br />If nothing has worked for you- try this.  It's 30 days.  I've had 5 friends do this since they saw the success I had-- they've all had great success.  Insulin resistance may not be your issue, but if it is-- my blood sugar levels kept creeping up every year-- this is fantastic.<br /><br />On a technical note- the Kindle Edition cuts off the recipes in the back.  I just purchased the hard copy for this reason.<br /><br />And on a final note- read the ENTIRE book first.  This is a \\"try it\\" lifestyle.  The more you know, the more it makes sense and the more you will stick with it.<br /><br />GOOD LUCK!!e.<br /><br />The first few days- almost the whole first week- were MISERABLE.  I was mean.

0634023020|5.0|I can't imagine having enough to complain about to give this 2 stars. These are nice arrangements. Wish I'd found it long ago.
B004KPX5GC|5.0|I had never watched this movie.  I had resisted since I am old enough to remember Secretaroat when he won the tripple crown. A friend insisted, and we watched, it was wonderful.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Thank you Ridley Scott for showing today's non-talented producers how to produce a real SCI-FI movie correctly! Additional thanks for the much needed realignment of the SCI-FI universe, saving the ALIEN franchise. I hope you teach another lesson, by making the next installment of Alien, and putting into place stricter guidelines as to who you allow to film any installment of this franchise without destroying it with poor productions. I'm among the very rare and few (old school fans)that actually grew up with the greatest(SCI-FI) movie of all time...ALIEN! I actually seen this movie in theaters when I was a kid. Prometheus is a great Prequel to ALIEN. This movie answered a lot of questions I've always had about the ALIEN movie. However, after viewing this movie, new questions arise. Ridley Scott has once again reset the true baseline of any good SCI-FI movie. This movie is so well written and produced, and there are no dry or dull areas at all. This movie is all hardcore action from the word go. That's impressive! Alien movies are very complicated and can go off into any direction. The Cinematography, CGI effects, props and acting were stunning. SCI-FI movie like this are very rare indeed. This is an A-List movie which you should buy. I recommend blue ray. It has already been announced that there WILL be a sequel to this movie. Enjoy!uestions than answers. There will be a sequel to this movie per Ridley Scott. There are several biological questions that still need to be addressed. This type of movie can be very complicated and challenges who we are and where we come from. Only true FANS understand  this. Those of you who are just now jumping onto the ban wagon do not even have a clue, so your comments don't have much credibility...I grew up with the movie ALIEN,  so  people like me have deep rooted scientific questions that stem from our teenage years. I did catch one blooper mistake in this movie...it's at the end, the last surviving female,.. well  she  is outside with her \\"Helmet\\" on ...but notice what's  missing from her hands.  Gloves! This means the suit is not air tight. Really Ridley!  Other than that...this movie is the shit!  Thanks
B0097EWK3A|5.0|fun game,  not too intense. interesting story line,  but a little dramatic at times. i am looking forward to the next segment
B00992CF6W|3.0|needs blocks like redstone items portals and other things. I have the Pc version and it is better than this because it has all the blocks
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I read all the books this past summer, but missed the movie in theaters.  I pre-ordered this as soon as the release date became known, while there are definitely one or two important parts of the book missing from the movie, overall this movie was a great representation of the first book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun to play made me really think which is why I love this game and recommend it to people who love thinking games.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|super addictive and fun to play....love it..I do wish puzzle pieces would show up more but still highly enjoyable to play.

0451196716|5.0|\\"The Long Walk\\" is a fascinating novel written by American author Stephen King in 1967. He published it in 1979 under his pseudonym pen name of Richard Bachman. It is a story about a game show featuring an annual race between teenage boys. King is able to transform what would be a seemingly boring and ordinary plot into one that is riveting, entertaining, and even disturbing at the same time.<br />The story takes place in an alternate, totalitarian version of America, sometime in the near future. One hundred teenage boys selected from a random pool of applicants would compete in \\"The Long Walk\\" which is a national and highly publicized event. The winner of the contest receives the ultimate prize of anything that he desires for the rest of his life. All of the young boys, who are under the age of 20, are required to walk continuously at a speed of at least four miles per hour. If their speed falls below this threshold for more than thirty seconds then they are given a warning. After three warnings, another violation gets the contestant a \\"ticket\\" or he is otherwise eliminated from the contest. Their warnings can be reset if they resume and maintain the minimum speed for a period of time. They also can receive warning for interfering with other contestant and get an immediate ticket if they leave the race track for any reason. The walk begins at the border of Maine and Canada on the first day of May of every year and continues until all but one of the competitors is remaining and is not stopped for any reason at all.<br />Receiving a ticket isn't clearly defined in the beginning but it is quickly revealed as the first contestant \\"buys a ticket\\". This unlucky soul had succumbed to muscle cramps shortly after the contestants broke a record for the best start ever. When he slowed below the minimum speed after his final warning he was immediately shot in the head by accompanying military guards. It is discovered that buying a ticket meant certain death to a participant and the contest would only have one lone survivor by the end of the race.<br />The event is extremely popular and attracts several applicants every year. Only a select hundred are chosen from a large pool of candidates. One might ask why so many young boys would volunteer for what would more than likely be their undoing. This question is answered throughout the story as applicants are eliminated one by one. The spectators don't seem to care who wins the race, but rather are only there to witness the deaths of the losers. The atmosphere is reminiscent of the bloody, gladiatorial contests that were held in the Coliseum during the days of the Roman Empire.<br />Ray Garraty, the main character is a sixteen year old kid from Maine. He like most of the walkers makes friends along the way and starts to get desperate, afraid, and a little crazy as the contestants are eliminated one after the other. Although at bit depressing at times, King's does an excellent of keeping you in suspense despite the plot being about something as simple as walking. He keeps you hanging from your seat as you wonder who will be the next to buy it.
B0086449YA|5.0|You are get perfection with Mark Knopfler's production and guitar work.  For the most part a lot of jazz . Most enjoyable if you enjoy those arrangements.for a two disc set maybe an excess of mellow. The lyrics are disappointing. But if you enjoy the musical arrangements and the full sound Knopfler bring to music and recording this set is wonderful.

B008RYN44U|1.0|What a terrible disappointment this album was. Truly wish we could get our money back. Not one winning song here. Trite through and through. They should have stayed retired. Obviously the focus is not on good music or their fans.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I was hooked from the first episode! Great acting all around and the zombies are killer! I will definitely buy the second season!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so cool, I cann't stop playing it. If you want a challenge, you should get this game.
0316228532|1.0|I pre-ordered Rowling's new novel, thinking that a writer with her imagination and story-telling ability would write something else that was at least half as good as her previous works. No dice! This book was so crappy, I didn't fully finish it. I got through four chapters and couldn't stand it any more, so I just skimmed and speed-read the rest of the book.<br /><br />I read for four reasons: 1)to be educated, 2)to be entertained, 3)to be uplifted, and 4)to be inspired. None of that happened with \\"The Casual Vacancy\\". All Rowling did was give the reader a multitude of uninspiring characters that you never care about one whit. Not only do you not care about them, you can't stand them! The more I read, the dirtier and sicker I felt.<br /><br />A previous reviewer states \\"the plot doesn't matter - it was as dull as a bowl of oatmeal\\". I heartily concur! Rowling doesn't seem to be able to pick a theme either. She's got death, cheating, cutting, masturbation, child and spouse abuse, drug abuse, twisted marriages, twisted sex, bullying, crime, and so much profanity it's like reading a jail-house conversation.<br /><br />I am so mad I bought this book! I'd donate it to my local library, but why inflict it on others? Wish there was a way I could get my money back.
B007THA4FI|2.0|After writing seven books without a swear and nothing more sexual than a little \\"snogging\\" JK let herself go wild.  I am concerned because some of the Harry Potter material was taken from her childhood so if some of her childhood is included in this book she needs counseling. The book details child abuse on every other page, which inclused neglect, emotional, and sexual abuse.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|One of the best Paul Newman movies ever made. Newman is so harasmatic and likeable in this film that you can't helpbut root for him every step of the way. George Kennedy is great too!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I think it is fun! So what you have to wait a little while for the food but it's really addicting. I just got some decorations for my restaurant and it looks cool!!
B009AMAKJU|5.0|I don't think I could've like this movie more. Steven Chbosky really makes his novel come to life in this spellbinding adaptation. The dialogue is very honest and as you see these characters progress through the movie, you really want to see them succeed. Logan Lerman is very good as a high school freshman trying to fit in and move forward through his past tramas. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller are the friends that guide Charlie into the real world and they give terrific performances. See this film, it sticks with you.
B0058VW36U|5.0|i really enjoy this app because it is funding fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun! BUY MEEE!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I have been reading WOOL in my own beautiful isolation and regret leaving the world of your engaging characters to tend to my own life.  Looking forward to  meeting up with each silo one day.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|If I didn't already have a great appreciation for the Seals, and the great men and women that also serve, this book really enhances my understanding and gratitude. It does not compromise national security or seek personal agrandizement. Sadly it also helps to understand why this man, and others like him, are no longer Seals. Don't miss it. You'll be glad you took the time.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|I really enjoyed this documentary. In particular, it made me wish someone would dust off the entire Beatles Kinfauns sessions and release them as a new Beatles product. The Beatles \\"Unplugged\\" would be great to hear in a digitally remastered format. As it was, I loved the Kinfauns version [snippet] of While My Guitar Gently Weeps.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is realy epic and diamonds ! op ill love to get my hands on that (: im 16 and single and I r<br />ealty love building
1442346949|5.0|It's a great book and the audio book (CD)is really entertaining. The writing is truthful and factual. I enjoyed both items so much and I told my friends that they should read it or listen to it.  [[ASIN:1451648537 Steve Jobs]]
B003V4AK8E|1.0|I bought the controller and only had it about 2 weeks before the transmiter stopped working. That's 40 bucks gone.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book was very hard to follow as far as the characters were concerned.  Definitely not a book that kep my interest.  I had to force myself to finish it.
B0088WGBC8|4.0|Interesting premise with good twists and turns. I enjoyed this movie, more than a lot of other movies I've seen lately. Denzel was his usual self.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I know what actually took place during 1963 regarding JFK's assasination. Or, at least what was made known.  But the concept of imagining the consequences of a different outcome was intriguing to imagine.  Stephen King always surprises us!  And this outcome was typical Stephen King.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I originally got this app as a Free App Of The Day because I enjoy Sudoku and this looked similar. The game does seem a little intimidating at first and takes a few puzzles to start figuring out the tricks, but it quickly becomes an engrossing experience. Even when you know how the game works, the challenge remains. There is always a way to figure out the puzzles logically. I have only had to make a blind guess on 2 puzzles. Be warned that some of these puzzles take some work, you may be at it for quite a while. This is a great game for any puzzle enthusiast.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game!! It is challenging and soothing to me at the same time! You choose if you want an easy game or harder game. The music and graphics are very good as well. Thank you!
0316228532|5.0|Firstly, those people getting upset that this is not a kid's book/not Harry Potter really need to read more about a book before they buy it. It was categorically stated that it was an adult book, and not more HP. Secondly, I thought this book was excellent. I just finished it this morning, and I really would like to read more about the people of Pagford, as soon as possible. I was completely drawn into this very real and well written world, and if I have any disappointment, it's that the book was not longer, and that there isn't (yet) a sequel in the works. The characters were three dimensional, and interesting, and I have absolutely met many similar \\"types\\". Yes, there were a lot of characters, but this is a story about the inhabitants of a town - and to fill that larger picture, you need a big cast. I could see this novel translating easily to the small screen, perhaps over 5-6 episodes - I would love to see that in fact. Perhaps at some point, J K Rowling can shake off the mantle of Harry Potter and write more novels like this. I would absolutely invest in another one, and hopefully I will get the chance to do so.
6304696558|5.0|my granddaughter is heading to Army boot camp tomorrow and we thought this would be a good watch. everyone loved it. 5 stars.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I was recommended this book by a friend. While i normally do not read this genre, i thoroughly enjoyed this book. Lee Child's descriptive skills really stood out. His writing left a distinctively clear image in my mind, without being long winded. i have not experienced quality writing like this in a while. The storyline was anything but predictable and kept me interested and entertained and on the edge of my seat the whole time, from beginning to end. I enjoyed it so very much that i went and bought the second Jack Reacher book, as soon as i finished this one. Highly recommended.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This was slow, boring, and illogical.  What a waste of time.  Good thing I only rented it.  Was anybody able to sit through this to the end in the theater?
B008XG1X18|2.0|Worked fine &amp; wonderfully for a few weeks, then the app decides it doesn't want to respond. Love the app when it works, but the glitches need checked. frustrating.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My twins who are 4 absolutely love this app.  My son loves the stickers and my daughter loves the paint.  I love that they are also using this as a way to practice writing.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great book , hard to put down ,I really enjoyed Mr Gray shades! Ana side kick in her mind makes you laugh
B005LAII0I|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.<br /><br />Beautiful acting, storyline, music soundtrack, and cinemagraphic (reminds of 1960's technicolor with a 3D illusion).<br /><br />Great for families and adults.  Trust me, I did not want to see anymore kid movies but this is very entertaining.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This movie is absolutely fantastic! It's great fun for the whole family, we can just watch over and over again.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This app is very addictive but if you really want to get the full experience you will need to open your check book. the game gives you 45 coins to start but when you run out that's it. if you want more then it gives you the option to buy them. No thank you. I never spent money on Farm Town &amp; I refuse to spend it on this!
B000TERFGO|4.0|Great Music! I listened to this on the plane all the way to Sacramento, CA. I love it! You get lost in the music.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was so looking forward to JK Rowling's new book.  I love her story telling ability, however I was very disappointed in this story.  It really left me flat.  To me, the characters were not very interesting and the story did not keep my interest.  Sorry, but I cannot recommend this book.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|The book is well written so that even a non-technical person such as myself can understand it, although it undoubtably is more meaningful to computer-savy individuals. The length of the book and the amount of details are just right for my taste. A good read and very informative.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|use it all the time. i find many things on you tube i would like to share so i copy save then show to others with out buffering on the phone which is far better that letting it stream. it is a must have in my book. does so much to be a free app.
034580404X|5.0|I loved this set of books, they were very easy to read & very hard to put down.  I couldn't wait until my next opportunity to start reading my books again.  I hope E L James writes more of these...but until then, I'm looking out for my next book to enjoy as much as I have these books.<br />Very well recommended to all.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I loved it and it really good u should write  a other one it helps me ,find words and grap  like that
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|just right, easy to follow, gets better all the time, not too short and not too long, love the spins
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Loved it is a little laggy but it is so much fun.  wish they would add something new though u should definitely get it<br />)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun game that really helps pass the when I have nothing better to do. A. A. A. A. A.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very good account of the action. The detail was very real. Do not see that any sensitive infornation was released. Story very realistic
B009329ZF2|5.0|definitely an attention retaining pleasent way to spend an evening with family... on the edge of our seats and not wanting the thrills and mystery to end! was definitly worth the wait and money spent... thank goodness for amazon.com and their means of affordable entertainment.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The Help is one of my favorite books. I have shared it with so many friends and have had many lively discussions concerning it. The movie is good but did not do justice to the story. The actors were great. I will go back and read that one again.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|one of those things waiting for a second part made it all worth the wonder... excellent cast and storyline... another thank goodness verizon.com exists... our collection of such wide variety has been well worth cost and time well spent on every minute of enjoyment.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I found the story a little predictable and rambling. My expectation of the book was very high because of previous childrens books so I was a little dissapointed, but that will not stop me reading the next book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is a page turner. I never give 5 stars but this was good to the last sentence and had so many twists and turns in it it keeps the amateur sleuth on her toes.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great item. I wanted something small and compact and this is it and it works great. I can take it wherever I need to.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Gave me 4X Ethernet copying speed on my MacBook Air (compared to USB adapter).  13 MB/sec to 55 MB/sec.  Greatly reduce my backup times.<br /><br />FYI.  Some people seem disappointed that this product does not speed up their internet access.  Typically, this will not speed up your internet access.  Your internet access is normally between 1 to 10 MB/sec, depending on your service.
0060007737|5.0|If you want to know why some products succeed and others fail, you'll want this book. The authors have broken it down into their 22 laws which explain why two brands seem to dominate every category, why your success in one category doesn't necessarily translate into other categories (but that won't stop some bored executive from trying!) and how fielding too many products can dilute your brand. You can agree or disagree with the premises of this book but you should at least use those premises to resolve for yourself how to do advertising and establish brands. The best advertising book I have read in a while! Very helpful with both photo and written illustrations.
B008EQIK90|4.0|laughed our arses off! the fact that it was so cheesey made it even better.  great family lesson on sterio types.
B000001Y5D|5.0|Awesome! I just love this CD. [[ASIN:B000001Y5D Bigger, Better, Faster, More!]] The whole thing is great. Of course the mega tune \\"What's Up\\" is what I was waiting for.<br />This CD took me to YouTube to watch music videos featuring Linda Perry and her So Powerful Voice with the 4 Non Blonds which I also really enjoyed. Good to see her Come Back!<br />A Great CD for me to listen to when cooking dinner. Dancing with the wooden spoon as a microphone and lip singing is a common sight in my household when I have Bigger, Better, Faster, More of the 4 Non Blonds blaring from the dining room. Lol. That is when my pup is in the bedroom for a nap as she really dislikes this sort of music, especially if there is any real volume to it :o<br />Just love Linda Perry's crazy hats. She is So Cool.<br />If you enjoy this sort of music and care to learn more, I recommend checking out all there is to watch on YouTube of the 4 Non Blonds or even Google Linda Perry to learn a bit about her history.<br />Quite Fascinating.<br />Enjoy!  I know I sure do.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|As a die-hard scifi/fantasy snob I rarely delve into self-published material.  I'm thrilled to say that The five star reviews for Raven's Shadow Blood Song are completely deserved. Just finished reading it and went immediatly to the author's blog to find that the first draft of book 2 is complete with hopefully publication in December.  Fortunatley,Blood Song does not end in an unresolved cliff-hanger.  Buy it now!  I'm off to reread it now...
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|no idea why its so highly rated... even for a free game this is lousy. it just goes way too slow and boring.
B008XG1X18|5.0|and my Kindle Fire. Now they are one. I give Pinterest 5 stars and the app 4 stars.....only because there are a few bugs in it....much better app than others though.
B0094B2K2W|5.0|I loved this television show. Plus watching DVDs is like watching a month long movie. If you love fairy tales with an adult twist then you will love this. Plus the bonus disc gives you a few more insights on characters and the season to come. I can't wait for season 2.

0375507256|1.0|I read Cloud Atlas several years ago. It made so little an impression on me that I forgot I already read it and almost ordered it again today. Another look at the book cover and an unsettling feeling about the name of one of the characters (\\"Frobisher\\") finally brought my memory back. I just remember being incredibly bored by the stories and wondering what was the point of it all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very entertaining and hard to put down.  Enjoyed reading this and have already ordered part 2.  Now I think I need to see the movie:)
B007THA4FI|4.0|Human behavior fascinates me, and this detailed exposition absorbed my attention to the extent that for much of the book I forgot to look at the Kindle indicator at the bottom of the screen. Rowling clearly is a keen and perceptive observer and listener, and her facile use of dialect and vocabulary of each character is accurate and consistent.<br /><br />I'm not certain what other readers were expecting or hoping for, but some of them seem to have wanted something else. Maybe the book would have been better received had she written under a pen name. In any event, the deliberate pace of events is essential to develop each character and bring the story to it mostly inevitable end. Though the ending was abrupt, it was not surprising. Had it extended with more detail, it would have decreased my conjecture about what each character had learned and not learned, how he or she had grown or remained static.<br /><br />This is a book for adults truly interested in the human drama.

1451627289|3.0|I enjoy reading the novels by Stephen King, \\"11/22/63\\" wasn't one of his best, but certainly not one of his worse.  The concept of time-travel in the novel is very original, one can go through time via a portal in a 2011 Diner which is located in a closet, which always sends you to the same date and location everytime you use it - September 9, 1958.  You can spend years in the past, but when you return to the present (2011) you've just been gone two minutes.  And anything changed in the past affects the present, unless you go back again even for a minute, then everything starts from scratch as it originally was.<br /><br />Al, the owner of the Diner, has used the portal or wormhole (it's called \\"rabbit-hole\\") in the novel many times, but his ambition is to prevent the assassination of JFK.  Because he is dying of cancer, he convinces his friend, Jake Epping a high school English teacher, to stop Lee Harvey Oswald.  Jake undertakes the task, encountering the US of the 1958-1963 era.  He also encounters the resistance of time itself trying to prevent the past from being changed. Jake discovers this by trying to change history in smaller events among ordinary people.  Through several hundred pages of rather tedious stuff, I'm assuming that Stephen King has a big obsession of late '50s culture, music and dance, Jake accomplishes his deed and prevents the assassination but not without a great personal loss.  He returns to the America of 2011 and of changed history.  The world is almost literally falling apart and political history has went awry.  What's a poor time-traveler to do, but to cause a reset of what he has done.<br /><br />The novel's shortcomings, were first of all, it's length.  Which didn't keep me as enthralled as the massive \\"The Stand\\" novel.  Also, I'm not into the '50s culture as apparently King is.  The romance between Jake and Sadie dominates much of the novel, and I'll never look at another pound-cake the same way again.  The real disappointment wasthe lack of depth about the origins of the \\"yellow-card men\\" who are apparently some kind of \\"time-guardians\\" who watch the \\"rabbit-hole.\\"  We only learn about this in the last 10-20 pages of the novel, and without very much detail at all.  Also disappointing, was the all too brief return of Jake to the very messed up America of 2011, after he changed history by preventing the JFK assassination.<br /><br />The novel in my opinion, is more of a romance novel, than science-fiction.  The idea of a time-traveling wormhole being in a diner's closet sounds corny at first, but if any of you remember the gothic-horror daytime serial, \\"Dark Shadows\\"  there was \\"stairway through time\\" which connected the Collinwood of 1970 to the Collinwood of 1840.  And I've read that Stephen King was a fan of the original \\"Dark Shadows.\\"<br /><br />I gave the book three stars, it's shame I can't give it any more than that.  But it's mediocre at best if science-fiction is your game, perhaps better if you're into romance novels.  But I think a lot will agree that Jake's tracking of Oswald did get a bit redundant.

0547848412|4.0|The story of Pi Patel his bravery, determination and desire to succeed against all odds is the premise of this modern day classic, and one that deserves to be read by all generations of book lovers.<br />The premise of the book is that life is a story, and this is reiterated with startling clarity throughout Yann Martel's prose as he manages to combine a clever use of imagery together with a lyrical narrative. At times reminiscent of Rudyard Kipling, Life of Pi is a story of survival at its most basic level. The spiritual voyage of individual belief combined with the power of imagination provides a unique vision which allows the reader to undertake an idealistic journey into the unknown.<br />The story doesn't suit everyone, reviews have been divided since it was first published, but it does make a very good book group read as it always encourages lively debate.<br /><br />Life of Pi has been reissued in light of the recent movie edition, and as such will bring this unusual story to a wider audience.
1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House, by Kathleen Grissom is a fictional historical account of slavery, indentured servitude and the daily interactions of the plantation household in the American south.  In school, we are taught the aversions of American slavery, the Atlantic Slave Trade but little is known or taught about American indenture servitude during this time period.<br /><br />Utilizing the late 1700s architectural landscape of a southern plantation and its surroundings, the two main narrators of the story, Belle (slave of mixed heritage) and Lavinia (white indentured servant) are introduced to us.  Through physical and psychological bondage, their lives are dramatically intertwined with love and sadness.<br />In most homes, the kitchen is a place of gathering, preparing food, daily conversations, and where wounds are tended.  In The kitchen, Grissom utilizes the physical structure, as an instrument that separates and brings together all that are part of the daily workings of the plantation.  This is where, we are introduced to the other inhabitants of the plantation, Cap'n (plantation owner/ship merchant), Miss Martha (Cap'n wife), their children Sally and Marshall, Uncle Jacob, Mama Mae, Papa George, Rankin (the overseer) and other members of the plantation.  Each individual character has their distinct personality.  Each in their own way, mold the reality of the lives of Belle and Lavinia.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, Grissom weaves the storyline with deliberate, delicate and purposeful accuracy by incorporating the unequivocal descriptive details and vernacularize dialogue of the ante-bellum inhabitants.  This also helps in setting the tone in understanding the various levels of status of the plantation inhabitants.<br /><br />The time period is late 1700s were Belle's (a house slave) position is that of the cook for the big house.  Not only does the physical location of the kitchen separate her from the big house and the field slaves, she is also separated by her parentage.  (This is later elaborated in the story).  In introducing Belle to Lavinia, Uncle Jacob (another house slave) tells Belle, \\"The cap'n send this chil' to you.  He say she for the kitchen house\\" (p. 4).  Belle immediately describes Lavinia's physical description by saying, \\"What's that man thinking? Can't he see she's white?\\" (p. 4).  By doing this, Grissom makes you wonder why a little white girl is being sent to work in a plantation kitchen.  And with this question, the reader begins to wonder about indentured servitude in America.  Although not defined clearly in the story, indentured servitude is the practice of placing a person in contract work for a fixed period of time which would last between three to seven years.  For their service, they did not receive payment but received food, clothing, lodging and learned a skill.<br /><br />The location of the kitchen, with Belle's and Lavinia's position on the plantation, a string of ante-bellum stereotypical conflicts are put in motion that ignites the relationship ebbs and flow of the plantation inhabitants.  Lavinia, lost her parents to illness and is placed in the kitchen to learn a skill.  This in itself gives the reader a view of the shared experiences of herself and Belle.  Belle on the other hand,  is believed by Miss Martha, her son Marshall and Rankin believe Belle to be the Cap'n mistress, when in actuality she is his offspring that he had with a slave woman that he adored.  Through the interactive descriptions, Grissom was able to verbalize a documented fact of the common occurrence  of the relationship between a slave owner and his female slaves.<br /><br />By positioning Belle in the kitchen, the Cap'n has deliberately placed her out of sight of Miss Martha, his wife.  Although Belle feels the love of her slave family, not being publicly acknowledged by her father, Belle is faced with the constant reminder that her life is in limbo.  Filled with the love of her adopted family (slave family), and recognizing the reality that she is not like the rest of them, Lavinia must learn to navigate between both worlds.<br /><br />Although the plot was depressing and hopelessness loomed over the horizon, I continually found myself not wanting to put the book down.  Grissom as a historical storyteller and researcher, kept me entrenched in the daily lives of Belle and Lavinia.  Her descriptive application of dialogue with the architectural landscape gave me a deeper emotional connection of this time in American history.<br /><br />Reference<br />Grissom, Kathleen. (2010).

B000NHQLPS|5.0|Wanted to see this film yet again and found a copy of the Special Edition Steelbook DVD at a great price from one of the associates here on Amazon. Decided on the DVD edition because it includes the bonus \\"Scorsese On Scorsese\\" piece that is, apparently, not on the Bluray edition. Highly recommended.
B007TK77QE|4.0|This was not a children's story, but it was a great read, and I found I could not put it down until it was finished.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great reading very interesting. Couldn't put it down!!! Love the characters and the whole story. Great author goes into very good detail
B004LROUNG|4.0|This is a sentimental sort of story rather than the more strict morality tales John Grisham has told in the past.  I found it a little slow getting into, but past the half-way point he begins throwing in enough excitement to hold your attention.  It's a sweet story, and a good read.
B0012HQKZE|4.0|A little far fetched with script.  To domronr thst was engaged with my wife and attempted to kill me, not sure I would regard him with compassion.  Cinematography great...............
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|OMG!  This movie was great!  Was totally mislead by the so called \\"critics\\".  It goes to show you that they don't know what there talking about!  This might not've been accurate to the comics, but I didn't care so much.  I couldn't believe when I found out Joss Whedan directed this.  But when I found out it explains how good the movie is.  Just look at Serenity!  Even if your not a fan of Marvel Comics, you'll enjoy this!<br />PS:  Mr. Whedan, we need a Serenity Two.  I'm waiting (impatiently)!

B007MB5OCE|4.0|No preconceived notions when I began this read.I found myself laughing aloud and genuinely engaged.

I would definitely like to know where he is off to now!
B0086UXYZO|2.0|The Vaccines debut was an energetic fun ride.  I had eagerly looked forward to this album's release.<br />But, by the second song my son and I were wondering if this was the same band.  I popped it out of the CD player and put in The Birthday Massacre's new one instead.<br />What happened to the Vaccines?  The energy is gone.  The tongue and cheek lyrics<br />are absent.  The production overall is dismal.  Three songs on the album are worth a listen while the rest is forgettable.<br />This was not a wise purchase for me--on the CD shelf it will go to gather dust.  Much better new music of this genre would be:<br />The Chevin/Borderland, A Silent Film/Sand & Snow, The Killers/Battle Born, and the list goes on.  Save your money here.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I'm more angry at myself for not figuring out this movie than I am angry at Scott or the movie.  The acting is good but the story is very boring and tries to add suspense but never fulfills.  If you are going into this expecting something new and exciting - you will be disappointed as I was.  The movie begins almost 100 years in the future and the team of doctors/scientists/engineers and yes, the ubiquitous millionaire investor, are looking for answers to our existence.  Searching for God, if you will.  If you are not religous, you might find the \\"awakening\\" for these folks funny.  If you are religous, I suggest you be prepared to be insulted and even angry.  Not a horrible movie but I would wait for it to come out for $1 - if I had done that, I would not be so emotional about being disappointed by this movie.

0385742886|1.0|I loved the Death Cure Series and I was really excited when I learned that there would be a prequel. But, boy, was I let down. The characters are thin and as underdeveloped as the entire concept of the book. At no point did I feel even remotely connected to either of them. On top of that it was extremely poorly written. I have to be honest and say that I actually didn't finish the book and therefore cannot tell whether it gets better towards the end, but based on the other reviews I highly doubt it.
B008HK3S04|4.0|This Kindle Fire case is really quite nice.  It's a real sturdy product with excellent quality materials that make it a sure fire item that will last for quite some time.  The velcro closure is very secure so there is no worry of your kindle falling out accidently.  The fabric also feels like it would be good to help keep your kindle dry if you were running in the rain.  Double stitched is a fantastic quality that I like since I do quite a bit of sewing.  It always makes things seem more secure to me and it only takes a few extra moments.<br /><br />I feel for the price you are getting a nice quality case that you should be happy with for a long time.  Check out the different colors that it comes in too as there are some really pretty ones if you like something a little fancier.

The most important aspect of this book is the illustrations. The book is full of detailed, yet beautiful pictures of all the adventures the boy and the monsters experience with each other. Children should have a fun time reading this book since it is full of exciting moments that are capable of making the reader laugh, smile, and dream of new worlds.

B009B50QOU|4.0|This album sounds much more like Green Day before American Idiot and their obsession with a softer, rock-opera type sound. IMO, this means it is much better than their recent albums. There are several songs that re-use and play off of riffs from songs from Nimrod and other classic albums. These moments hit you right in the nostalgia in a good way. Overall, there are a couple duds in this album, but the older sound matched with Armstrong's more modern and cleaner vocals is quite good. It will be interesting to see what Dos and Tre have in store.

B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Liam Neeson has quickly become an even bigger star than he already was thanks to the first Taken movie. Since then, he's appeared in more action movies, with the big one after Taken being The Grey. I was excited to see it, as the trailers showed just enough to get you interested, and it looked like he was going to be fighting wolves instead of European traffickers.<br /><br />However, the trailer is probably the reason this movie's getting so many mixed reviews.<br /><br />Neeson plays Ottoway, a marksman who was hired to kill wolves in Alaska. He's haunted by flashbacks of his wife, and sets out to kill himself after taking out a wolf. He's unable to do so, and heads back for his plane to go home with the oil workers. It's a stormy night though and the plane has a lot of turbulence, making for a bumpy flight. The bumpy flight soon turns into a nightmare- the plane is ripped apart in mid-flight and crashes. Ottoway wakes up and sees complete destruction (to say the least), finding only a small handful of survivors. The men set up camp at the crash site for the night, only to be disturbed by wolves. These wolves aren't just passing by though...they want the men dead. Even a little provoking by one of the men proves to be a big mistake as the wolves respond, showing just how outnumbered the men are. In the middle of nowhere, without any real supplies and weapons, and with a bad egg or two in the group, how are they going to make it out of this alive?<br /><br />There's so much that could've been standard with The Grey, but I was amazed at how quickly things moved along and how it kept my interest from beginning to end. Ottoway is a great character, not being the perfect leader. How often do we get stories like this, where the group is led by someone with no flaws? Ottoway admits that he's scared right off the bat, and that there's no shame in it. Why bother trying to show how manly you are in a situation like this? He might come off as cool and relaxed, but the guy shares a couple of laughs with the others at appropriate times. It's good to see that. The other survivors are all given a good amount of time for the most part, and whenever one of them was threatened, no matter how they may have been acting just seconds before, I cared. One man tells a story about his daughter and her long hair, how she'll swing it around in his face to get him up. We find out that another had a sister that passed away when he was a kid, and he still hurts from it. There's a lot I want to say about these characters but doing so would ruin a bit of the movie.<br /><br />The cast is good, and The Grey has a lot more than just that going for it. The Alaskan scenery is absolutely beautiful. A lot of the locations reminded me of the snowy winters of Oregon I saw when I was younger. There's a scene that takes place by a stream, and you can tell that the director let it play out long enough for you to enjoy the beauty. And how about the plane crash at the beginning? Good lord, I haven't seen anything that intense in a long time. The last big plane crash scene I saw was probably in the first Final Destination, and the one here easily beats it. Before it was even halfway over, I didn't ever want to step foot on a plane again, blizzard or not. One more thing I'll mention is the 'philosophical' nature of the movie. A lot of people have complained about this, and I don't understand why. It's not overdone, not preachy, and it was cool getting something like that in an action-thriller movie. The only thing slightly overdone is the poem that Ottoway reads a couple of times. It's a great poem the first and last time we hear it, and I wish it was only these two times that we heard it.<br /><br />What keeps The Grey from getting a full 5 stars in my book is the wolf attack scenes...and I can't really fault them for how they did it. Wolf attack sequences are usually done at night with a lot of camera movement to add suspense. The first time the wolves attacked, I wason the edge of my seat, and also unsure of what exactly was going on because it seemed like I was staring at a black screen for a few seconds at one point. In fact, I'm pretty sure I was. I feel things could've been a little cleaner with this part. I'm just glad they didn't take the cheap way out and give us CG wolves. How embarrassing would it be to see men facing the elements, and then a CG wolf pops out? The other small complaint I have is just a pattern I noticed about the movie. It made me laugh when I realized that the movie's pattern is: walk, set up camp, get attacked, walk, set up camp, get attacked. Of course they do a little more here and there. It's just something I noticed.<br /><br />Those little nitpicks aside, I didn't have any problems with the ending. With how much the poem is drilled into your head, I thought it was pretty obvious what happened, especially when you see the quick scene after the credits. I guess if people are complaining about a movie being 'too philosophical', then it shouldn't surprise me that the ending needs to be spoon-fed to them. If you haven't seen The Grey yet, you're missing out.

B004L9MFM2|4.0|I have been thoroughly enjoying Martin's medieval/fantasy series.  I especially enjoy that the series is about the story itself, not a particular character (otherwise it would be called 'A Song of Ned Stark' or 'A Song of Robb Stark').  Martin's willingness to kill off characters that have become beloved isn't a terrible thing at all.  It keeps the story fresh as the reader wonders what will happen next.  The only thing that awards this chapter 4 stars is that some of the plot is a little difficult to understand as a logical sequence of events (which was so great about about the first two instalments).  I think these are probably petty concerns but it detracts just a little from the story.  If you have read the previous instalments - buy this one.

B008RTE08E|5.0|I'm mainly writing this to stress that there are multiple versions of this film available on DVD, and Amazon can't seem to differentiate among them.<br /><br />If you're looking at Amazon's listing of the 2012 DVD release of this film, you're looking at a great disc. If you're looking at a DVD released prior to 2012, you're looking at a bootleg, and a poor bootleg at that.<br /><br />From 1963-1970, the Beatles made five films: A Hard Day's Night (1963/64), Help! (1965), Magical Mystery Tour (1967), Yellow Submarine (1968 - they didn't really have much to do with it), and Let It Be (1969, released 1970, not on DVD as of this writing). If you're into the Beatles at all, you really need all five films.<br /><br />If you've ever seen it before (and not many have), this is the best that Magical Mystery Tour will ever look. The Beatles were on their own, their manager and friend Brain Epstein having passed away a few months prior. They did the film on their own (mostly Paul McCartney), without a script, and it was a mess. Nevertheless, it contains videos for six songs that are classics in the Beatles' canon, and the videos for the most part serve the songs well.<br /><br />The extras on the 2012 DVD are too cool to ignore and make the DVD well worth the price of admission.

B003F5NSTW|4.0|This book was recommended to me by my English teacher; she thought that I was more of an adventurous spirit. I can easily say that this was an incredibly poignant account of a PERSON dealing with a situation that's been reduced by (pop)psychology and the media. Why do I capitalise 'person'? So often when a book is written from a mother's perspective (or any perspective where sentimentality is expected) the mother is entirely enthralled with her children/husband. I really enjoy Eva (the protagonist) because she is believable; she is a real person who has been thrust into a situation that is complex and nuanced.<br /><br />I am sure that most people would regard Kevin as an unrealistic character. I would respond that society's over-romanticising of child-rearing, as well as the supposed infallibility of parental bonds, have left most people incapable of understanding that there is no \\"minimum\\" bond between a mother and son. There is also no reason to believe that a child like Kevin is implausible, on a planet with 6 billion people - the odds of such a coupling (Eva & Kevin) is not unlikely.<br />The plausibility of Kevin's character aside, the development is superb! I really enjoyed the way that characters were introduced and used as illustrations for how Eva and Kevin interact with each other. The complexities of their relationship was truly made clear in the writing.<br /><br />The medium which Shriver uses (letters addressed to Eva's husband Franklin) was very effective - the bareness and frankness of her letters allows one to be entirely immersed in Eva's mind. The fact that they are addressed to Franklin make them all the more bittersweet, and it's truly agonising that it turns out that they have been addressed to his corpse throughout the narrative.<br /><br />I have been singing the book's praises throughout my review; yet I have given it only four stars. The reason is the disastrous ending.<br /><br /> [SPOILER ALERT] Kevin finds himself suddenly at a loss for explaining why he committed Thursday, and actually seems to be acting normal towards Eva. He's also afraid - why is he afraid? He's afraid of real prison. The simple fact is that Shriver took mass-murdering Kevin on page A, then on page A+1 he is suddenly harbouring fears and doubts all along. It's simply (in my opinion) a stunning Americanism, where suddenly there is a wave of redemptive (in an implicit sense) sentimentality. Why did Kevin not remain resolute? I feel that Shriver destroyed the believability of Kevin's character by giving-in to a \\"happy ending\\" for the book (as far as this story can produce a happy ending). Most people can't take a book that is relentlessly, inevitably dark and true. It's in our nature to want to see some humanity from Kevin. Hence I deducted the star for Shriver's craven ending: the rest of book was superb.explaining why he committed Thursday, and actually seems to be acting normal towards Eva.

0316228532|1.0|It took an effort to finish this book.  Ala Miss Marple, Rowling has decided to expose English village life as the a true cesspool of humanity.  There is not one sympathetic character.  They range from nasty and unpleasant to warped and vile.  Nothing good happens in this book.  It is a total downer with many tragic events and noone even learning from them.  If you want to be depressed, read this book.  I guess the author wanted to prove she is a serious writer.  If this is how she sees the world, she needs some serious help.

B007THA4FI|1.0|This book really makes me upset. One thing that J.K. Rowling was excellent at was making even the characters you didn't like, likeable in a way that kept you interested. There was not one character in this entire book that I liked or thought was the least bit drawn out. It's as if she wrote a book every crappy person she's ever met and tried to write a story around it.<br /><br />No real story.<br /><br />No magic.<br /><br />As an adult that grew up on Harry Potter, was nurtured by the words of J.K. Rowling, I have to say I feel as though a good friend has passed away from reading this.<br /><br />There was not even a tiny spark of light in this book.

1577314808|5.0|My mother and father are Christians - they study their bibles almost every day, to hopefully glean wisdom and to further incorporate the doctrine they find so important into the very foundation of who they are..<br /><br />I feel similarly to The Power of Now, and A New Earth. The books are less \\"self help\\" than \\"self discovery\\", and when you begin to synthesize the information, you come to realize how it's been there all along.<br />More than teaching you something new, it's as profound as someone who always looks straight ahead being reminded that they can gracefully, and easily use their neck to turn their head - expanding their capability, as well as world view.<br /><br />Truly an enlightened text, which therefore enlightens those who read it. I do that however important you or i personally find this book, each person must be at a point in his or her life to really synthesize the message. for instance, you can gift this book - and you'll most likely want to - but the person who receives it may let it sit on a shelf for quite some time before something in them becomes curious. Rome wasn't built in a day, and \\"a new earth\\" won' be either i suppose ;)<br /><br />I highly suggest reading The Power of Now first. It's a bit more accessible upon first reading, and jumpstarts a beautiful change within you - when you're ready for it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It had me captivated from the very first page till the end. Granted, Katniss was a bit more whiney than one would prefer a leading female in a raunchy action thriller. However, considering the circumstances she endured...I would be the same if not worse in such a situation. Sorry for the vague review but I do not want to give anything away. Bottom line if you like the storyline from either reading the first book or movie you will enjoy this book immensely...
0345444051|5.0|What a gem of a sci-fi read.<br />If you have an interest in science fiction, this is required reading and you can stop reading this & other reviews now ;)<br /><br />Beyond a compelling and grandiose read, like other Clarke novels, it's a window into more than just space and science, but into the potential of Mankind itself - our potential as a species, and the inner potential we all possess.  It therefore transforms from an entertaining sci fi read to a text that through its richness of thought and exploration of inner dimensions becomes far more. Wonderful.

B003Q6D1YW|4.0|Catfish is a captivating film although I have some doubts that every last thing presented by the filmmakers is true. The story moves along at a very good pace; and the cinematography, while somewhat amateurish, works well enough to enhance the film. There's a fine musical score and enough time for us to get to know the people involved in the story which highlights online relationships with all the inherent benefits and risks.<br /><br />At the start, we meet a young successful New York City photographer Nev Schulman who works with his brother Ariel and their buddy Henry. When Nev gets a painting of one of his photos sent to him by an eight year old in Michigan named Abby; Nev is flattered and starts an online friendship with Abby under her mother Angela's supervision. Ariel and Henry document the budding friendship between Abby and Nev by filming it; and it isn't long before Nev befriends Abby's entire family and starts \\"internet dating\\" and flirting using text messaging, phone conversations and online chat sessions with Abby's older half-sister Megan. Nev befriends other people on the Internet who also know Abby's family.<br /><br />But things become much more complicated. While on a trip to Colorado, Nev gets some music from Megan--but they turn out to be songs posted on a website by another artist! They also can't find any evidence on the Internet that Abby is an artist. Nev feels confused, scammed or taken advantage of but to some degree the young man really doesn't know what to think. Nev, Ariel and Henry decide to get to the bottom of things: They fly to Chicago, rent a car and drive to Megan's farm and the town where Abby and her family live to find out once and for all what's going on.<br /><br />What Nev, Ariel and Henry discover is shown in the rest of the film. I agree with anyone that the trailer for Catfish is misleading; it's not a thriller despite their best efforts to use music that sounds \\"eerie\\" and their encouraging each other to check out Abby's family when each of them gets almost too nervous and scared to discover what might really be happening. Nevertheless, what they discover is quite dramatic.<br /><br />There has been considerable controversy over just how much of the story is true. One thing is clear: the scene in which they discover Nev's mail to Megan at a farm where Megan told them she lives was almost certainly fabricated. The camera shows that postcards from Nev to Megan were already stamped \\"return to sender\\" so they couldn't have been sitting in that mailbox; that mail must have been returned to the sender (Nev in New York)--and then brought back to the Michigan address by Nev, Ariel and Henry so the scene would look realistic. Whoops! Looks like there's at least one hole in the story; that leaves me wondering how much of the rest is true.<br /><br />The DVD comes with an interview with filmmakers Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman as well as Nev Schulman.<br /><br />Catfish is interesting not necessarily for honesty but more so for highlighting how people can use social media websites to portray themselves or others as they wish--and what can happen in \\"real life\\" as a result. I recommend this film for fans of documentaries and people who are interested in the effect of social media on human relationships.family when each of them gets almost too nervous and scared to discover what might really be happening.

Everyone will love this movie. My mother who is not a super hero fan loved this movie. You just can not watch this movie and not feel good throughout it.<br /><br />But on to the 3D part. So many movies, for me at least, even if in the theatre the 3D was breath taking, for some reason the BluRay 3D just wasn't as awe inspiring. Fantastic movie! Depth to the video! But nothing that really grabs you and pulls you in. The Avengers was amazing in 3D in the cinema! Finally getting to pop in the 3D BluRay at home, I was expecting the same mediocre results as the rest of my collection. But The Avengers 3D actually maintained the WOW factor! They actually managed to make you feel like you were part of the experience in your own home! I feel they did a better job at the 3D transfer than most of the films where they use 3D as a gimmick and force the \\"pop\\" effect. This movie is already a must have film for everyone, but the 3D version is a must have for the 3D alone!

B008673ZAQ|3.0|Wow, where to start. Let me first say that I was waiting for this sequel like a kid at Christmas. I even pre-ordered it so I would get it as soon as it was available and then stayed up late checking my kindle until it appeared and at the risk of being exhausted at work, I stayed up and read front to back all night long. Well, the happiness I felt at 2am was long gone by the time it was 5am and I'd finished reading this book. It was nothing like its predecessor \\"Bared to You\\" which was a wonderful read with strong, mature characters who were interesting and pushed you to the point of not wanting to put the book down.<br /><br />I don't know who the people were who showed up in this book. Eva a sassy, strong young woman of 24 turned into a needy, whiny, weakling who phoned in her robotic performance. As for Gideon, he was an alpha male who commanded attention with a cool, dark veneer and intelligence made even more enticing by his secret past and love for Eva. But, for this book, he too phoned in his robotic performance and became a two note of sex and violence. I was looking forward to these characters fitting the original title of the book \\"Deeper in You\\" because I thought that's exactly the direction this book would take the reader but it didn't even come close. This leads me to think Ms. Day herself knew this book wasn't going anywhere and therefore changed the title to \\"Reflected in You\\" because that's exactly what large parts of this novel were, a reflection back to the most filler parts of \\"Bared to You.\\" It seems this book was written under the assumption people would read it without having read the first due to all the over-telling of places, events, and secondary characters.  And yes I understand the reflection part is supposed to be Eva reflected in Gideon but I hardly find that to be true given she was an open book and he was a closed one.<br /><br />I want to say if you decide to take on a subject such as Child Sexual Abuse or any form of abuse it should be treated in a manner that is respectful and intelligent for those out there who have really suffered from abuse. It's not something to be taken lightly and research is required before putting information out there, yes even in a fictional book. This is the problem I had with \\"50 Shades of Gray\\" along with the general bad writing and plot, but I digress. I get that Eva and Gideon are victims who have been pre-disposed due to their abuse to use sex like an addict uses drugs - when they're happy, sad, angry, bored, lonely, etc. to feel good about themselves and their relationship. But, Gideon was made to appear like he was using Eva as his sex toy and Eva was just happy he would show up to use her. The scene in the limo was the worst ever - not romantic in the least. None of the repetitive sex scenes were what I would classify as \\"HOT.\\" There was so much hair fisting in every sex scene I seriously wondered if these people would show up bald in book 3. And, while I'm on repetitive, Hello- raised/arched eyebrow is the new biting lip. Geez everyone's response to anything was always a raised or arched eyebrow - I guess this means no one in the book had botox.<br /><br />Getting back to plot fails - I read this book twice because I really thought I was tired and it wasn't as bad as I initially thought, but it was. There was so much potential here from \\"Bared to You\\" like Eva facing her own abuser and using her Krav Maga skills to kick his a** maybe even kill him in self-defense then Gideon would have to deal with a woman who took control of her own problem while being submissive in the bedroom - that would be something I'd like to see him work with.  And, that would be a true reflection of him since I think he probably killed his abuser.<br /><br />There are many other plot fails, but the biggest is to bring in a non-descript character to run down the Cliff Notes of what happened to Nathan and for anyone who's watched one episode of\\" Law & Order\\" knows that was a completefail and just plain lazy writing. If you didn't want to get into the Nathan thing why even put it in the story? It did nothing except make Eva look like a desperate women and Gideon a thug - not the refine \\"urbane\\" New Yorkers they've been painted as. Not to mention the whole \\"event\\" and most of the book was predictable from chapter 2.<br /><br />I'm going to be completely honest and say I feel like this book was dumb downed to match in my opinion the \\"50 Shades\\" series. And if that's true then this book was written for the money and not for the art evident in I paid $3.82 for \\"Bared to You\\" and this book is $9.99. Sad being picked up by a publisher killed this series. I would not recommend.fail and just plain lazy writing. If you didn't want to get into the Nathan thing why even put it in the story?

The cameos were great too.  Sebastian Bach..showing his face many times as usual.  LOL  Anyway, if you want it to be a serious movie, forget it!  If you want a satirical, musical romp through the good ol' days, then this movie is for you!  Surprisingly, Tom Cruise can sing....a little.  His version of what he sang of \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" was just right.  Mostly the audience sang it, sorry about the spoiler, but it was fun anyway!  So sit back, put on your leg warmers and spandex and ROCK OUT!!!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great fun for everyone and never boring.  Grandparents and grandiose can really have fun.  Worth the price for sure.  #1 we've found!

B003SI6C4O|5.0|One of the best sci-fi thrillers you've never heard of. I happened to stumble across this on my Kindle and only barely remembered any buzz about it. I'm glad I found it. It's tightly plotted, with great effects, the science fiction premise carefully introduced and kept plausible.<br /><br />Philosophically, the movie grapples with the difficulty of changing destiny, and it's from this difficulty that the movie derives a tension that arches over the immediate problems faced by the main character. By turns it appears that he has, and then hasn't, been able to change fate for the victim the movie begins with. These twists, and the final ending, remain satisfying and even believable, within the premise.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love the game but it takes to long to collect engery tho.... it should Sss have others helpinh u collect stuff...
B0060D08JO|5.0|The original Tron was an eye-popping revelation with a story that was ultimately disappointing in its simplicity, glossing over the interesting possibilities it raised. Tron: Legacy returns to do it right, and for me, it worked. Tron: Legacy greets the mystical dimension of a digital collective unconscious head-on, and explores it without trivializing it (no &#34;midichlorians&#34; or their like here). The music by Daft Punk is a terrific addition and fits perfectly.<br /><br />The CGI reconstruction of a young Jeff Bridges works perfectly well in the digital universe, but when it's done in the &#34;real world&#34; it falters in a couple of scenes. Someday those scenes will look dated. But that is one of the very few visual flaws.
0743289684|5.0|Infidel is a detailed, comprehensive look at a Muslim woman's life and how she grew up into very intellectual questioning about her religion.<br />Ali's writing is not literarily smooth, but the story of her life is very compelling.<br />A very interesting read.
B004NELBPC|3.0|If you're interested in the text of the articles, this is a fine interface to the main sections of HuffPo. But it's irksome to run into a slideshow or video and get little &#34;?&#34; in question marks, or an unresponsive black screen. Don't tease. If the assets aren't available for mobile, don't publish them there.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|While Ben Affleck's acting career has its share of hits and mostly misses, he's now 3 for 3 as a director.  Here he recreates a real life rescue which only came to light in 1997.  If you were around in 1979 or have knowledge of history you are already familiar with what is known as the \\"Iranian Hostage Crisis.\\"<br /><br />When the deposed Shah was allowed to enter the U. S., Iranians were none too happy.  They wanted his head in a noose.  As a result, they stormed the American embassy, imprisoning the ambassador and his staff for more than 400 days.  What didn't come to light until later is that 6 staff members were able to escape through a back door.  In this film they were secretly taken in by the Canadian ambassador (Victor Garber).<br /><br />CIA \\"exfiltration\\" specialist Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) came up with a plan to bring them out by passing them off as a Canadian film crew scouting shooting locations for a faux film called \\"Argo.\\"  Mendez gets the authorization from his boss (Bryan Cranston) and enlists John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) who were real life movie-makers to create the background for the film.<br /><br />Affleck could be fairly criticized for casting himself in the lead, but he is spot-on with the rest of the cast including those mentioned above.  All could be up for Oscars in a few months, especially Arkin.  They add some needed snarky humor to the serious events in which they are involved.  This helps ease the tension Affleck masterfully creates in this gripping film.  He manages to take a true story of great importance and give an audience 2 hours of exhilarating entertainment.  The final act found me with a white knuckle grip on the armrest, although I did think the last second chase of a rumbling 747 was more theatrical hyperbole than actual events.  That minor quibble aside, \\"Argo\\" is one of the best films of the year.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This puzzle system has kept me entertained.  the free puzzles are plentiful and the options are sufficient.  the play is also well thought out translation into computerized from the old printed versions.  the shapes are good and the &quot;magnetic&quot; edges work well when dealing with small pieces.
0812550706|5.0|A fantastic read and a great inroduction to the author.  This was the first book of his I'd read, after finishing it I read right through his entire catalogue.  It's that good.  The charachters display admirable morality, kindness and compassion BELIEVABLY.  They are neither cowards or weak for doing so, and this is what sets Card up as a fantastic molder of charachters.  Hooray for morality!

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I've read Game of Thrones-A Song of Ice and Fire, book one of a 5 book series.  I enjoy reading books speaking of fantasy in far off lands where no one has ever heard of, sorcery, magic and mystical, romance and hatred, swords and soldiers and lords and ladies.  There's a little bit of everything and it has you coming back for more.
B005LAIHPE|2.0|This movie is bad. The script, acting, editing, and cinematography were all awful. I get the idea of bringing the board game into it, but it's way out of the box and totally unbelievable.  The only points it gets is for some of the special effects (I almost believed some of what was on the screen).  But just as soon as I get into it, Some bad editing ruins the moment. 1.7/5 Stars. Don't waste your time (unless you really love Rihanna).
B000UNYJV8|5.0|Best skinhead movie ever!  The music, the clothes- it all feels right.  We've all know guys like Combo his non-skin drinking buddy.  Amd of course the riffs and divisions were always there and I think the movie captured that well.  Guys like Woodie were few and far between.  I still don't understand why they went with the ending like they did- it just didn't make any sense.
B001NESPHC|5.0|I heard Melody Gardot thru Itunes Ambient Radio station. This album captures her pain and unique style - very natural without having to sound like any great female singers past and current but herself. The recording is very transparent and the microphone placement makes it sound intimately haunting. Deep within the corner of my mind is a haunting melody. All the tracks are first rate. Waiting for another follow-up. Thanks Melody !!!
0525953728|5.0|I received the book in about two days and immediately started reading. It is an excellent book, well written with just enough information to put the reader into the action. The author does not go into minutia detail like a Clancey novel which keeps the narrative moving. After reading I gained a new appreciation and respect for the dedicated members of our armed forces and especially the special ops units. I highly recommend this book.
B007THA4FI|4.0|J K Rowlings in her book Casual Vacancy has succumbed to a genre that is based on reality, but delves into the world of sensationalism. Her fantasy is much faster paced and exciting...rather than boring. This reader found some pages were worth skipping.<br />  I can see why movies producers are shunning this story. Not enough action and too contrived.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|this is a great family movie. my kids loved it as much as i did when i was young.<br />i would recommend this movie to any family.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Great read.  James Clavell captures you from the very beginning with the characters and the vivid descriptions.  The story is so good you don't want to stop but you have to due to the length of the novel.  Highly recommend purchasing especially on the new Kindle Paperwhite!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I've enjoyed alot of Apps. This one is well made. Fluid, fun and very replayable. You need to get this for your library, its a definite must have!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Excuse me, my inner goddess just tried to escape out of my ear, and I let her. This is an absolutly awful book. The sex scenes are deplorable, the plot is Twilight (another awful book) and I felt nothing for the characters except disgust and horror. I weep for the future if people today call this well written literature.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Bravo I want to see this on tv a series, please don't leave me hanging want to know more 6-10 maybe???<br />well written,could imagine this happening. again a very good book, hope there is more to come.

B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This is a novel that took me to the crude reality of women in Afghanistan. Is is a beautiful story supported with many, many facts that make the reading experience truly enjoyable. It is incredible what women in the middle east have to go through. A real eye opener.

B001NIA27E|5.0|Dante's Peak is a great movie to watch for those who loves Adventure. I wanted to know how the family of 3 (A mother and 2 kids) along with the person studying volcanoes got out safely from the town that will be destroyed. Again, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves watching adventurous movies.

1595827684|3.0|Initially I had pre ordered the Special Edition of Mass Effect 3, but as the bad things about the game came to light I canceled my pre order and bought this book instead.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase however this book feels like just a larger version of the art book that comes with the special edition of the games rather than a comprehensive catalog of work.  (not necessarily a bad thing)<br /><br />The content and its presentation are quite good.  Getting to see portions of the design process, and some of the ideas that were not/or could not be explored was very insightful.  As an illustrator myself, seeing how others tackle a particular problem and some of the decisions that they reject, is just as interesting to me as the actual pretty pictures. I was disappointed to see that there are little or no comments or sidebar annotations from any /mmuch of the art team, nor are they giving any credit anywhere in the book (unless all of the work presented was done by the art director).<br /><br />\\" THE ART OF THE MASS EFFECT UNIVERSE\\" is a worthy candidate for anyone who collects art books.  It is a hefty tome chock full of visual goodness.  The overall design and the build quality (assembly, binding, stitching, etc) is very good and Dark Horse Books deserves kudos for its fine publishing effort.

1401322786|5.0|The Time Keeper was a fascinating fable.  I finished reading it and started over. Imagine three children playing in a field long, long ago.  Dor would become Father Time, Allie would become his wife and Nim would become the king of Babylon.  The two present day characters, one wanted more time and the other wanted to shorten her time on earth.<br />I want tell the story, the plot is captivating.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|I have only one thing to say... This Hailfire blaster is a huge advantage on the nerf battlefield. It makes the bearer a one man army. Literally. I go me vs. my brother and his 3 friends, and I still win. Only thing is, this gun only comes with 4 clips and 24 darts. Fortunately for me, I happened to have 4 clips from previous firearms, (recon, longshot, longstrike) and all I needed to do was purchase a 30 pack of elite darts, ($30 @ walmart) and I was ready to go.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I have owned the graphic novel \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" for years now and it is one of my favorites. This animated version is very much true to the original both in graphic style and in story line. I thought this novel was taylor-made for video when I first read it.<br />I will not summarize the plot here. I am sure other will do that. For those who know it, you will find some short pieces missing and much of the story line with the Joker are not there but I expect some of that will be put in the second part which I have not seen yet.<br />The only thing that I missed was the inner monolog that Batman has throughout the story. A few things are replaced with dialog but there are not audible thoughts. I do miss that but otherwise this is very close to the original. One always has to expect that some editing will be done when converting a story from one medium to another. Very enjoyable.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I thought the movie John Carter reminded me of Star Wars with the mix of ancient machines that flew and were deadly.<br />Good movie, too bad Disney lost money on it at the box office.
B0095R76EW|1.0|I actually like most romantic comedies which is why I rented this, but \\"The Five Year Engagement\\" isn't even remotely funny. The estrogen levels are so high it makes \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" seem like \\"Fast and Furious Five\\".  Guys, you've been warned.  This movie is strictly girls night out!
0307279189|3.0|Born to run is a book about running.  More specifically it is a book about the Tarahumara Indian runners and the few outside of Mexico who have actually competed alongside them.  I really enjoyed reading about the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico's Copper Canyons.  I found their history and culture very interesting.  I also enjoyed reading about the U.S. ultra-runners who decided to venture down to the Copper Canyons for a race against the Tarahumara.  The book was also a book about the author's journey to transform himself into a runner that was injury free by studying the ways of the inhabitants of the Copper Canyons.  The only part of the book that I didn't enjoy reading about, was the 30 or so pages that scientifically explained  why humans are so frequent injured from running.  Overall, Christopher McDougall wrote a book that I enjoyed reading, but it could have been about 30 pages shorter.
B008VSIAN2|3.0|[[ASIN:B008VSIAN2 March of Progress]]<br /><br />Threshold is not my favorite prog metal band.  In fact its not in my top 25.<br /><br />However, Damain Wilson's voice is irresistable to me.  Regardless of the style in which he sings, his voice is spectacular in my view.<br /><br />That said, I would encourage to buy this on the strength of his voice.<br /><br />March of Progress is probably mistitled because it is not all that progressive, either in its style or in the sense of moving their body of work forward.  So in the latter sense it doesnt really march ahead.<br /><br />In fairness, it has some tunes with nice riffs and some catchy hooks.  I know that's not reason enough to buy the album.<br /><br />But did I tell you Damian Wilson sings on it ?
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I really enjoyed this imaginative remake of the children's classic. The seven dwarfs were not the guys I remember as a child.

1449389627|5.0|I wish I could give it more than 5 stars as it is the most awesome book I have read in long time. It is a must-read for people who want to pursue the path of innovation to change the worlds. It busts the various myths involved around the \\"moments of epiphanies\\" , \\"best ideas win\\" and lot more. The book states the quite obvious but yet ignored facts for creative work.<br /><br />Some of my favorite quotes from the book -<br /><br />\\"The world cares about the ideas that are shared (not the ones that are in your mind)\\"<br /><br />\\"All great ideas require grunt work\\" / \\"At some point, all creative tasks become work\\"<br /><br />\\"People are bad judges of their own ideas\\"<br /><br />Have fun reading this awesome book.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've had these headphones for over 12 years now, and they are as awesome as the day I first put them on.  I have drawers full of other headphones (even from Sony) that I thought might be better, both cheaper and more expensive.  The short version is, nothing exceeds the clarity and richness of these.  You can blast whatever you're listening to as loud as your ear can stand, and the sound is crisp, clear, and free of any distortion.  Bass response is amazing.  Also, they are extremely comfortable, so wearing them for long periods doesn't give you sore contact spots.  Over the years, I've become protective of these 'phones so the kids don't get at them and ruin them.  They stay in a little-used drawer in a 200 year old desk in my office, and they only come out for something special when I want to hear every little detail.  Replacement ear pads are $9, so I ordered several sets.  Better to spend $9 keeping these in business than wasting money on other headphones that can't compete anywhere near this price range.  I intend to go to my grave listening to these.

0345803485|4.0|This book is structured around two people.  Christian Grey is a handsome, knowledgeable, successful businessman.  Anastasia Steele is a college student still finding her way.  They happen to meet only because Anastasia fills in for a sick friend and interviews Christian for the college's newspaper.  It's apparent that Anastasia's nervousness is appealing to Christian.  He apparently finds this attractive in a woman and attempts many times throughout the interview to cause her unease.  Just from this encounter, both Christian and Anastasia become somewhat enamored with one another.  Christian wastes no time in finding out everything he possibly can about Anastasia.  He finds out where she works and shows up there.  Keep in mind that Ana works in a hardware store.  This is some place that no one would ever expect a rich businessman to be frequenting.  There is a feeling that Christian is hiding facts about his life from the beginning of the story.  When he does show up in the hardware store and asks for Ana's help in purchasing some questionable items, it intrigues Ana.  From here the plot centers on not only Christian learning everything about Ana but Ana begins to learn things out about Christian.  Although she is interested in him, the reader gets the sense that Ana is somewhat afraid of him.  They both have a mutual sexual chemistry each one wants to explore.  Christian explains eventually that he is considered somewhat distasteful in the sexual world according to society.  He goes on to explain to Ana that if she is interested in entering a contract with him, he would be willing to start a sexual relationship with her.  The contract continues to add to the plot of this story.  The contract is made in order to protect Christian against any retribution from a love slave.  It has particular rules regarding submissive behavior expected from the slave.  Ana initially balks upon finding out about this hidden side of Christian.  She has already started to fall for thisman and clearly cannot walk away.  There is further complication when Ana reveals that she is a virgin.  Christian shows Ana another side of himself after finding out about this.  Instead of being the sexual deviant she expects, Christian shows her a tender side of himself.  There is a constant battle of wills between Christian and Ana throughout this book.  At times it does become annoying that Ana seems to be somewhat of a crybaby.  She groans and moans a lot about getting new clothes, a new car, and other items Christian wants to give her.  The book can be somewhat repetitive with the sex scenes, however it stills manages to hold the reader captive.  The idea that a woman with no knowledge of the deviant sexual world meets the brooding handsome man that introduces her to it quickly will keep readers coming back and probably re-reading it.  I personally think it's well worth the purchase and difficult to put down.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I think this is a very fun game but it never gives a good mix up of the prizes. So moving forward in the game is taking far to long.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Perks main character, Charlie, is so endearing.  You find yourself routing for him and becoming his friend as you read.  Just as you would do for any \\"underdog\\" who is trying to change their life for the better.  The movie and book were both equally powerful, thanks to the genius writer of this book.  He also wrote the screenplay for the movie.  I didn't want the book to finish because I felt like I lost a friend in the end.

B007TK77QE|4.0|You can't expect to know what this book is going to be like  Jk Rowling writes an intriguing novel that whilst slow and really not much happens till the very end she keeps it ticking over enough that you struggle to put it down. I thoroughly enjoyed it however I do get a little lost in stories that every chapter is  told by 'a difference perspective'.
0060873175|1.0|Awful.  Embarrassingly bad dialog, \\"slasher film with bugs\\" storyline.<br />By the end you won't even care who dies:  if your  brain can make it that far .<br /><br />Waste of money, and more tragically, TIME.
B0044FEZBM|5.0|Outstanding. Natalia Osipova is right at the top of her game and an absolute joy to watch. Despite her stealing the show the corps de ballet and other principals are by no means overshadowed. Ivan Vasiliev also performed magnificently and the pair were perfectly matched.<br />The story of the French Revolution is well told in dance and the haunting music so evocative of the time and place. Folk tunes are picked up and of course La Marseillaise is showcased.<br />This will appeal to all, both newcommer and connoisseur alike. An outstanding example of the genre.<br />Budding dancers can learn a lot from examining the finer detail and the bonus section interviews are riveting.

B008I34YYY|5.0|I'm not sure how people are so disappointed with this movie. It started out silly, and the absurdity got exponentially more intense as the movie went on.<br /><br />Yes, the acting may be off at times. The writing may be poor at times. The direction may be clunky at times. But none of this matters. If anything it enhances the \\"expensive B movie\\" feel.<br /><br />If I have one complaint about this movie, it's that it made me appreciate the potential awesomeness of a Sarah Palin presidency. That's scary.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is the best game somebody has ever made. I played it a ton of times. Best ever selling game and its free.

B0009UC7QQ|5.0|One of Jim Carrey's quintessential films, entertaining yet containing certain elements of 'what if'. In a world filled with dozens upon dozens of reality tv shows and trash tv, you have to question whether this isn't a social critique of sorts.<br /><br />Either way, it's extremely funny, and some of Carrey's best acting is featured here.
B008A1NSTG|4.0|The movie was well cast and story line was good for all ages. It was a little slow in the beginning but the action picked up quickly. It had a great message for young people that if all nations work together great things can be accomplished. This theme of team work is so important in today's world.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Everyday, I look forward to having time to escape into this book. It is well written, imaginative, and totally entertaining. The characters, with all of their strengths and weaknesses, seem very real. One can imagine clearly the setting and people of this ancient time. A reader can clearly see the author's creations in their mind's eye. I have only read 20 % of this book, but it is captivating and a very good read. It is the kind of book that makes you think about it during your day and wonder what will happen next. I would never read the last page of a book first, so I cannot be certain, but I believe that upon finishing this book, I would want to rate it with 5 stars.
0307730697|5.0|Sometimes when i find a great book or new author, i'll post a recommendation to share with others. this time, i am at a loss for words. There was a small town kid from Arkansas whose life became absolutely derailed by drugs. A crack addict, he also intraveneously speedballed heroin and coke, stole from family and friends, and finally ended up facing 11 felonies when he was 23 years old. He found God, got clean, and with considerable assistance, joined the Navy with the intent of becoming a SEAL. Inbetween he met Kelley, the love of his life, battled relapses with crack (even after becoming a SEAL), and accomplished feats no one on the planet had so far attained. when he got shot in the eye while training down in Georgia, his military career should have been over. when the fingers of his right hand got severed in a rollover in Iraq, he had them re-attached and taught himself how to shoot left handed. A member of SEAL team 4, he tried out for the elite team six, and did what no sniper anywhere in the world has ever done before--shoot expert with the non-dominant hand and eye. Never has a SEAL been allowed to go downrange into a combat theater with one blind eye, and never has someone passed the stringent, other worldly requirements of landing on Team Six, where the top 1% of the top 1% reside, with injuries like these. At any point, he could have retired with full disability and benefits, but he continued on, raised two kids, and was about as selfless as any human you will ever read about. which is what makes this story so profound. It's the story about all of us, battling whatever demons we face, demons looking to take us down. Sometimes there are true giants that walk among us without our knowing it. Sometimes there are tragedies and events that define who we are. Adam Brown's story is not to be missed. And neither is this book, aptly titled \\"Fearless,\\" by Eric Blehm.
B009GEPPYC|1.0|Terrible destruction of awesome music. This was the gayest, most boring excuse for a rock movie ever. Tom Cruise should be ashamed of himself, as should the artists that allowed their songs to be butchered in such a manner.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I have read the first book and now this one and I will definately be purchasing the last of the trilogy<br />an easy and raunchy read for me.<br />not a literary masterpiece though.
B00846REIS|2.0|After reading 50 Shades Trilogy, this book was disappointing!!!  Poorly written, too many First person sentences!!  Somewhat similar story line!!!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I didn't think that they couldn't make a better snow white, I guess I was wrong, absolutely loved this one.
B000JMKO3C|2.0|I found this to be an unlikable book; it was difficult to read. There were difficulties in following changes of character when speaking and many changes in point of view through out the book.<br />I knew from early in the book that Veronika was not dying of heart disease. The clues were far from subtle, more like a hammer. Few women dying of heart disease could go through the the extended sexual climaxes that she did,nor \\"trudge\\" up a hill, nor get totally drunk, nor stay up all night walking around.<br />The ending was  disappointing as was the entire book.The ending was very abrupt and left the reader with many unanswered questions.

Really I can not say, as these fabulous artists association has been such wonderful.<br />This (vynil) album is still my favourite in my collection.<br />To be honest, I bought this Jewel Box to make a gift to a good friend of mine.<br />And I rented the same in our Multimedia Center.<br />I found that beautiful songs has been added again to the original (vinyl).<br />This item has been shipped in a very short time, and well arrived.<br />And my friend did appreciate this gift so much ...<br />So, well let's go to 4 Way Street.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool Omnibus creates an absorbing dystopian world of oppression and treachery. The inhabitants of this world live underground in a silo, the outside world above ground hostile and toxic, a world they can only see on video screens. The political climate inside the silo is almost as poisonous as that outside. Those who voice their unhappiness are sent to cleaning, a death sentence where offenders are sent outside in airtight suits with a limited oxygen supply to clean the sensors which project a view of the outside world to the video screens on the upper levels. No one sent to clean has ever failed to do so, though no one knows why since nothing is forcing them to, and no one sent to cleaning has ever survived. Inside, the population is segregated by occupation, each living on their own levels of the silo. Everyone lives by a rigid pact, everyone but I.T. I.T. seems to run by its own rules while pulling all the strings behind the scenes. An intrepid few try to unravel the fabric of secrets and lies before they too are put to cleaning.<br /><br />Hugh Howey weaves a fascinating tale of politics, treachery, loyalty, bravery and love. There is no heavy-handedness to the storytelling. Revelations are woven in masterfully, gems for the reader to find and interpret. If you ever wondered who would replace Bradbury and Heinlein, the answer is Hugh Howey. Much like Stephen King, though he may not write in a genre you usually read, his masterful storytelling demands your attention. I can't remember who recommended this book to me, but I would like to thanks them. The story ends with a few open ends leaving room for a sequel, which I hear is in the works. That is a good thing as I was not ready to leave the world of Silo 18. There is also a movie in the works. I hope they do the novel justice. Read the book first.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another great read. Loved the first book and can hardly wait for the final chapter in this story line.<br />[[ASIN:B004V49H6O The Song of the Defiler (The Songs of Aarda)]]
B00846REIS|5.0|Very similar to Fifty Shades, just less graphic sex scenes. This book is very well written- can't wait to read the other two!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An excellent final novel to complete the hunger games.<br /><br />I realize that \\"The Hunger Games\\" books were written for young adults, however, the characters are so realistically drawn and their struggles are so compelling that even an older person like myself can become thoroughly involved with them.<br />I love character driven fantasy story lines and this series is well worth reading no matter what your age.<br /><br />A thoroughly enjoyable reading experience.<br /><br />Well done Suzanne!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004V49H6O The Song of the Defiler (The Songs of Aarda)]]

8876250441|1.0|Breaking Dawn, the final installment of the Twilight Series seems to be about wish fulfillment rather than a story about overcoming difficulties through effort.  The characters are basically handed what they want with little or no work for it.<br /><br />Additionally, the idea of imprinting on a child is repulsive to me.  It may not be pedophilia by its strictest definition, but it is still child grooming.  Jacob forms a relationship with an infant, knowing full well that one day he will engage in sexual acts with this child when it is older.  That idea is distasteful to me at best.<br /><br />Along with that, but earlier in the story, the offer Edward gives to Jacob, giving him permission to have sexual relations with Edward's own wife Bella was in poor taste, and did not add to the story nor move it forward.  I suspected it was put in for the young female readers who imagine themselves in Bella's place, to imagine themselves not only desired by two attractive men, but to imagine also the idea that both men are fine with her being sexually intimate with both of them.  To me, however, Edward's offer of sex with Bella to Jacob was unnecessary and offensive.<br /><br />There is more than can be said as far as poor writing, and unnessarily repeated description.  But I will not go into that in detail.

B008UTV6S8|4.0|When this item arrived I was very surprised. I had not realised it contained 2 CD's PLUS a DVD of Paul Simon's performance. I think it is exceptional value for money - cost only $20 for all that. Also he sings many of his old and famous hits - although I think the original arrangements were probably better than these new ones - BUT different groups and also  live peformance rather than studio recordings. Excellent - highly recommended to all who think Paul Simon is a great songwriter and musician!
B005DN7W4G|1.0|Not worth watching for Sci Fi. More emotional drama. Less of technical common sense.<br />The major sci fi parts of the movie are the space ship collision and the tidal wave - both are a few minute scenes at the end.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I expected a different type of story. Too much about teenagers and their sexual habits and not enough about the adults.<br />It was predictable.
B00139XSBA|5.0|This was a re-read for me motivated by the death of Neil Armstrong.  As an Air Pilot in the early-70's the \\"Right Stuff\\" was something we all knew existed but never discussed.  Military flying through the 60's and 70's was a special time in history for a special kind of individual. On one hand we could be the utmost professionals, but at other times gut-feel and what some call \\"flying by the seat of our pants\\" prevailed.  Today we look back on the Mercury Seven as larger than life heroes, but Tom Wolfe brilliantly unveils the trials, tribulations, and heartaches experienced by the Seven and their families.  I hope to get my grandchildren to read this book when they become teens.
1465001107|5.0|I buy a new MJ calendar every year.  This is the official [estate authorized] version.  The photos are always fantastic.
B007R41E8O|4.0|Decent game for the price. Good graphics and mystery story. Some scene sequences were a little repetitive. Game crashed several times (7 or 8 times) during the 4 hours it took to solve the game but only had to repeat a few steps to recover. Had to use the walkthrough on one of the mini-games.  Didn't use Openfeint. Works fine on kindle fire hd.
B0084I9QI2|4.0|Sadly, if you never got to see a Michael Jackson concert live, this is likely the closest you will ever get to seeing the creative genius in his element.  This supposed to have been created from MJ's personal live recordings. [the ONLY one! Right!]  Unfortunately, the truth remains difficult to ascertain.  I recall MJ himself saying that he was NOT able to add Dirty Diana back into the set on this date, when Lady Diana was in attendance, yet it IS on this--reported as live--recording.  I have also seen YouTube footage attempting to prove this DVD is not from that night.<br /><br />REGARDLESS, it is actual concert footage remastered to DVD.  I purchased the set for my collection.  The unreleased tracks are great.  It will be interesting to see how many more previously unreleased albums we will see in the balance of the Estate's posthumous contract with Sony.  It is such a bitter sweet experience for many of us.  It is difficult to contribute to Sony now, but if one wants the treasures that remain there is little choice.  We can only hope that the proceeds will in fact benefit MJ's children and his charities.<br /><br />Rest in peace Michael.
0307730697|5.0|Among the Best of the Best reads.  A must read about a SEAL but really about: a life well lived, a loving family, an amazing wife, uncommon friends/team mates, and a testament to one special man.
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|If you are a fan of Liam Neeson, then you will probably watch this movie.  However, I suspect that most will find this movie uninteresting from a plot perspective.  The plot is unrelentingly depressing.  Men working in a remote frozen wasteland only do two things - work and drink.  Flying home, their plane crashes in an area where there are lots and lots of large, aggressive wolves, who one-by-one, pick off the survivors from the plane crash.  Part of the issue with the plot is that the survivors of the plane crash always seem to have the worst luck.  Another unrealistic aspect is that the wolves are very big and fearless but what exactly where the wolves getting fat eating before the plane crash?  Also, the wolves seem to follow them everywhere - the men at one point make it down a shear cliff and low and behold the wolves are there as well.<br /><br />This movie could have been so much better if they had just toned down the huge amount of bad luck the men encounter, and the wolves were more realistic (check out the movie Never Cry Wolf for a more realistic perspective on wolves).
B0086700CM|5.0|My 9 year old daughter downloaded this game to my Kindle Fire...and I absolutely love it. It is challenging and relaxing at the same time. Also it is not one of those games that you have to wait to gain more time, coins, money ect..which I really enjoy.
B000I186FW|4.0|Alternate future movie. I thought it was very entertaining. Very dark setting that adds to the grim future that the movie was set in. This is a movie that you can watch more than once and still be entertained. Worth the rental price.
B00871C09S|5.0|Please note that I saw this on a movie channel so that I can't comment on the quality of the DVD release or its features.<br /><br />As there are already almost 400 reviews on this great classic I don't claim to be able to add anything that profound except to say that after seeing the movie recently for the second time I was pleased to see how well it stood up. I'm much older than the first time I saw it, which was probably 25 years ago, and it still held up very well despite my being a lot older and (hopefully) a bit more knowledgeable about film and cinema.<br /><br />The movie is really about the voyeur in all of us, the only difference being that, in the case of Stewart's character, Jeff, this isn't just the occasionally harmless voyeuristic act of which we are all guilty sometimes.  No. in this case, what starts out as a passive, casual pastime becomes a two-edge sword as Jeff follows his voyeuristic obsession to a nearly fatal end.<br /><br />Being a photographer, Jeff was already in a voyeuristic profession, so Hitchcock's choosing a photographer as the main character makes sense. As Jeff is confined to a wheelchair after breaking his leg he has few opportunities for diversion other than pensively looking out his apartment window at the rest of the tenants in his apartment building. The only problem is, he starts noticing some disturbing clues and from there he is drawn into a risky game of cat and mouse with Raymond Burr's character, putting both himself and Grace Kelly's character in danger.<br /><br />Looking out his rear window, Stewart casually observes the mundane lives of his fellow apartment dwellers, most of whom appear completely normal and of nothing more than passing interest. Or are they? One seems to be hiding a deep, dark secret. Perhaps that is just the tip of the iceberg. Maybe Hitchcock is saying that we all have secrets and perhaps it's only luck that we don't get found out by a Jeff who just happened to look out his apartment window one morning at the fateful moment and catch us in the act.<br /><br />Ultimately the movie plays on the tension between the desire to be merely passive observers vs. the desire to act and participate in all of us. Most of the time, it's our behavior that gets us humans in trouble. In Rear Window, it starts out as a seemingly innocent pastime by an otherwise bored Stewart, but it's his willingness to follow that wherever it leads that provides the suspense and drama here.<br /><br />The whole cast turns in fine performances and there's not a false note anywhere. Burr is great as the bad guy who brings a quiet intensity to his role. This is a movie that stands up to repeated viewing and deserves its reputation as a true Hitchcock classic.rning at the fateful moment and catch us in the act.<br /><br />Ultimately the movie plays on the tension between the desire to be merely passive observers vs. the desire to act and participate in all of us.

B0083GPDBO|1.0|I walked out half way through and I never do that. Another HORRIDLE movie shot with a video camera. Need I say more? Save 90 minutes of your life and take a nice long nap instead of wasting it watching this amateur garbage.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Kate Norton is one of my favorite writers, she transport me with the detail of her writing, the places, the people, everything.  This book reminded me how family ties are stronger than anything and how sometimes we have to make tough decisions in our lives.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|You get a four-Disc combo of the best \\"Comic book\\" action movie to date for under $20.  I originally pre-ordered this for $29.99 and felt that was a good deal.  Amazon automatically refunded the difference when they lowered the price.  You really can't go wrong when you order from Amazon!!!  This movie is great and so is the holographic image that comes on the case.  Only thing that I would change was that the while the case holds all four discs, it does so by stacking two on top of each other.  Not a major issue if you are aware of what you are doing when you remove and replace the disc.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I loved the story, and as usual, Kate's detail in every book makes you really view and feel the characters, places, pain, happiness and misery.  All good, all read, I'd recommend it as much as I'd recommend her \\"Secret Garden\\" (my favorite by her).

1476712042|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  The characters were very interesting. A real page turner.  I was pulling for Travis the whole time.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|Reason saying &#34;really…?&#34; is because for some odd reason, this book didn't go on it's usual jump start like the past books of this trilogy. Actually, I think this is the worst one, first being the best.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is a good book trilogy, but once the Crank thing got out, it could possibly scare the $!&?@ out of younger reading lovers. So unless you're a fan of zombies, I recommend not reading anything but that epic first book.<br /><br />Since I feel like saying random truths of my opinions, I'll keep writing this in a random order.<br /><br />Gally's second appearance made a shocking discovery to me. Or at least the trust Thomas had in him. I'm guessing now most of the Gally in the maze was a controlled version. This is acceptable for a good series.<br /><br />Chancellor Paige never appears. I expected at least one appearance, but nothing but those epilogues and the note for Thomas.<br /><br />Newt! He's kind of a ground breaker here. I won't say why so, but read this book and watch both yours and Thomas's ground break.<br /><br />And last, Teresa. Only reason I would give this book a one star, but unfortunately I had to balance out the goods and bads. TERESA FREAKING DIES!!! C'mon, she was my favorite character in every of the books. For saying WICKED is good, she should earn a little slack. (And by WICKED, I thought Paige.) Smart and thoughtful Teresa. Always following every single order. Kind (what I thought) at all times. And her present is not very much appearance here in this book and death on the last few pages. What a rip-off from life.<br /><br />It's about midnight for me when I wrote this, so I'll not conclude.  But what I would say, is that this book should have been a bit more reviewed.<br /><br />See that account name at the top? I'm not her, but her son.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|I fully expected a movie about killer worms to be corny, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually a good thriller action movie. Yes the tenticles coming from the beast is a little laughable, but none the less still a good movie.<br /><br />I remember when I was a kid watching this movie that I was scared. It brings back memories.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game. lots and lots of games that are fun and easy. I would recommend this for all ages. I love it.
B008V0OLOW|5.0|I love this CD. I have been a Diana Krall fan for 12 years and I love her interpretations of the standards, as well as her Bossa Nova CD and even the much maligned Girl in the Other Room. What a refreshing change of material and what a delightful selection of songs Glad Rag Doll is!<br /><br />I am listening to it for the second time as I write this, and I can see this will be one of my favorites, right alongside All For You and Live in Paris. Garden in the Rain, Lonely Avenue, the title track and Here Lies Love in particular stick out in my mind as instant classics, but the overall feeling of this disc is very reminiscent of Sinatra's wonderful albums of the 50's with Nelson Riddle in that it consists of songs that all have a specific feel or theme. I just can't stop smiling each time I hear these songs.<br /><br />Diehard fans of Diana's pop standards CDs may have some trouble with this, but I implore you to give it a fair chance. Diana's talent has rarely been showcased better, and the musicians she has surrounded herself with are impeccable. As others have said, it's great to hear old songs that have not been done by everyone and that allow Diana to put her own indelible stamp on them.<br /><br />Well done Diana! I look forward to the next challenge you tackle.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|Very deep novel. Typical PKD style. If you were thinking this was going to be like Blade Runner, nnnnnno. The movie is VERY loosely based on this book. Don't get me wrong though, I am very glad to have it in my collection.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I liked this movie. I didn't watch the theatrical version but rather the extended version and thought it was very good. I have read reviews that said Kristin Stewart was horrible, and that Chris Hemsworth wasn't much better. Although not a Stewart fan for many reasons, I thought her portrayal of her character was very well done. Except for riding to battle in armor in which she looked cold and uncomfortable (and who wouldn't under the same circumstances) She came across as very believable to me. Watching the bonus features, I learned that she is NOT a horsewoman, so her acting in that very brief scene was also understandable. I also thought Mr. Hemsworth's acting was right on point for his character. In all, I really liked this movie. The other actors were well done, and believable, except perhaps for the brother, and even the Queen. I find characters who are so evil a bit hard to take, but then, that is just my personal opinion. The acting was well done in all cases.<br />Now, on to the movie itself.  I don't care for dark movies:  meaning, scenes done in pitch black lighting. I can't see anything! Why directors feel the need to make things completely dark, so that only in a movie theatre can they be seen is short sighted. Even at night with all the lights out, there are many details totally lost to the viewer due to this fact. Also, and this may be due to my age, I really wish that moviemakers would take into account that \\"background\\" music and noise should be just that: IN THE BACKGROUND!!! Most movies these days feel that emotional music scores and sounds not related to actual actors speaking should be louder than the actual dialog. WRONG! If I can't hear the actors lines, how am I to understand what is going on? In some of the bonus features, I actually HEARD the lines missed in the movie because sound was not a major distraction in those interviews.<br />So, except for some major problems with filmmakers, which has nothing to do with this movie specifically, this is a great movie to watch for general entertainment value. And that, for me, is the reason I watch movies: Entertainment. I don't watch to be `preached' to about social issues, or for the most part, to learn about history (although sometimes that is a benefit, since I realize movies that have historical background are usually full of inaccuracies, which I am also aware of, so that doesn't bother me).<br />All in all, I would definitely recommend this move to others. It is great fun and well acted, in my opinion.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is incredible, and a good follow up from the first book.  I recommend anyone to read this.  A true love story.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|It works well. I was able to find & take pictures with it (though they are grainy). Add my own movies etc. One down side- wish it was easier to watch movies & find the camera.
0316228532|5.0|Could not put this book down, not just because of the intriguing plot but also because of the great writing. It is amazing that after so many years, Rowling is still able to keep me up and night turning the pages.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Monter, the 20th studio album from KISS represents the Evolution of the Band.  While it still has all the components of a KISS album, it also represents classic rock. I enjoy all of the tracks, but am especially fond of All for the Love of Rock and Roll.  I love ther fact that KISS did not bring any outside collaborators onboard and that the four of them played all the tracks and wrote all the lyrics. A nice follow up to Sonic Boom, and easily a great opportunity for non KISS fans to listen and enjoy what the band has become.
B0026LK100|4.0|I kind of wish that they used something else to portray the creatures babies... Instead they used superworms, also known as the larvae of Darkling Beetles. I was waiting for something to happen that would connect the fact that insects were related somehow to the creature but the creature had no insect genetics in it. I feed superworms to my Tarantulas and I'm guessing that a bat, which is what made up a part of the creatures genetics, would probably eat superworms so I just thought it was funny that they were talking about the insects as though they were the bat creatures babies. Other than that, it was a good episode. I love the series!
B009AJD5E0|3.0|I wouldn't watch this movie again....it needed to be a miniseries, as it is, you have to attempt to fill in not just gaps in terms of what makes sense, but in terms of characters, who they are, how they relate to each other, and what they go through.<br /><br />It was kind of like watching clips from episodes, of a jumble of patched together parts about people you didn't really know. Too many things made no sense....I felt cheated....that somehow the storytellers were untrustworthy....they never invested in character development and didn't give us enough for any of it to make real sense or be satisfying....<br /><br />I don't like that, and it was so promising at the beginning....
B008X9Z37A|5.0|I bought this cover to help protect my Kindle Fire. It also lets me hold it like a book. The people I work with always want to have a  look at my Fire. Everyone that sees it likes it.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|love the book and would recommend for anyone and  everyone. more books should be written like this. i give this book five stars
B009GEEMLY|4.0|I definitely would have preferred seeing this in the theater. I can't believe I missed it to tell you the truth. I must have just been too busy at the time. Nonetheless I was fully entertained and there were enough twists and action to satisfy my need for comic book hero movie worship. All the characters have their own quirks and failures and their inner outer conflicts make for great plot development. Like I said it's just good fun.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|Building all but the most simple castles is either very difficult or impossible. My eight-year-old  got this for her birthday.

B009KHDT0C|3.0|Was expecting more from this movie. Thought it would be funnier based on the previews, but really, the best scenes were probably what made up the preview. Story was a little slow, and the humor was lacking.

Since then I have been listening to it often (in prep to see her perform in Seattle).<br /><br />Some of the tracks have boring/monotonous bass/drum beats, and I wish she would re-arrange those songs to have more melodic bass & more creative drum playing. That said, I think her violin playing is excellent, and recommend her work.<br /><br />I was completely captured by the first two YouTube clips that I discovered by her: Crystallize, and Phantom o/t Opera (she was linked by Annie Haslam's site because she has a Mark Wood Viper violin that's custom painted by Annie).<br /><br />Anyway, the more I listen to this CD, this more I like it. Good stuff. If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would.
0307593312|3.0|This was the first Marukami book I read.  Its an okay book but it got really long in the tooth toward the end.  I liked the setting descriptions the most.  You really have to be okay with stretching the plot to like this book.  Like the whole pregnancy thing and the changing roles of the little people thing, these elements were manipulated to work with the story too much,IMO.
B004JK61K0|4.0|I gave this 4 stars because (unlike the Google client) it facilitated my multi-client environment, but sometimes the UI is confusing.  For example, basics like \\"copy and paste\\" will be a head-scratcher for users until they do a guessing-game to figure out the multi-step process.  On version 4.200, a related icon was mis-mapped or inoperable . . .
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Better game than I thought it would be.<br />Plane is pretty easy to fly but still a challenge.<br />There's a lot more going on than the first glance makes you think.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this book on a different website but want to add my enthusiasm to the almost 2000 other reviews.<br /><br />I love Wool! It is a book I would recommend to anyone. I read and read not able to put it down. There are so many questions still needing answers and I can hardly wait for the next book in his series. Hugh Howey writes wonderful and tragic characters who you are able to connect with and understand why they do the things they do, even if they are terrible things. The starting section of the book brought uncontrollable tears that I still think about 1200 pages later. What a beginning! It is extremely difficult to get through but hang in there! It is well worth it and you will be richly rewarded upon completing it. I sincerely hope to find out what happens to Lukas and Juliette and hope it's only wonderful. They are amazing characters.<br /><br />You need to read this book!

B000XR4OC0|5.0|I just bought these shoes and I love them for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1: With every pair you purchase Tom's will donate a pair of shoes to a child in need<br /><br />2: They look adorable with everything from jeans to cute summer dresses<br /><br />3: They're super comfortable (after they stretch out a little)<br /><br />Tip: Buy these shoes a HALF SIZE SMALL! I'm normally a 9 1/2, but was told to get a 9 because they stretch after the first couple of wears and they did and fit perfectly now.<br /><br />Bonus: If you have big(ger) feet like me, they make your feet look a lot smaller. Total WIN:)
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry birds is by far not my favorite game. But do not get me wrong I do like this game.And would also recomend it.
0316228532|5.0|Just finished J.K.Rowling's \\"The Casual Vacancy\\".  I'd say it is the antithesis of Harry Potter.  Hard read (compared to HP), cast of dozens and all omniscient up in there (though I luv watching skilled writers break rules, as a writer myself I kept mentally whispering \\"No Sir!\\" followed by \\"You go Girl!\\").  Wow.  Brilliant. All I can say is it is worth the effort it takes to read.  Though I sincerely hope the next book will take us inside a few more pleasant minds.  If it's not a classic, we've allowed our short attention spans to ruin us.

B00275EHJG|2.0|but I hated the fact that I had to fix it in order to watch the whole movie<br />it played the 1st half fine, however, the other half it just stopped and said the disc wasn't there<br />I cleaned  the DVD player and it did the same thing, so I got it fixed since I didn't want to return it<br /><br />It didn't cost much but still, I love the movie and happy I have it but the fact that I had to walk 2miles just to get it fixed is just crazy...I didn't return it cuz I didn't want to walk an extra 3miles to the Post Office
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I really enjoyed the second book in this series. There were some interesting character developments and I was genuinely left guessing throughout the book as to what mystery was unfolding. The element of surprise was wonderful as I can usually guess these things. It was well written.<br />Even though others have said the opposite, I saw more of the similarity to Fifty Shades in this book than the first. But not so much that it was a problem and by the end it was not reminding me of Fifty Shades at all.<br />I'm eagerly awaiting the next installment....
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is very much so like the catchy story in the Hunger Games. If you like 1st person adventures then read this book ! :)
B00866H7SS|4.0|Well, while I understand the similarities to Fifty Shades, I think the author was inspired by the plot of that series but took the basics of it and made her own version of it. No harm in that. I found the experience of reading this book completely different to Fifty Shades. Having said that, I enjoyed Fifty Shades a lot more and found it far more impressive as a series.<br />But, this series is interesting and I am hooked!<br />I found some of the sex scenes actually a bit off putting as the author is too descriptive - and I am no prude but over doing it by describing every little physical detail can really take the passion out of a scene. It's just not necessary!Especially when she describes his member as this massive, almost dinasouricly (I know that's not a word but it fits!) unnaturally large creature that she gags on - eww! Lol! So not sexy.<br />And I found the love story unbelievable, some of the conversations had me rolling my eyes.<br />And yet - you can't put it down. It's weird!<br />It is a story that ends up pulling you in and it is entertaining. It's also a series that gets better as it goes.....
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|This is the first time I've read a book using these themes, although I've heard that this book relies heavily on its influences to tell such a good story. I see originality here, having only read William Gibson and Philip K. Dick and I don't see them majorly copied in anyway. To me, this is a highly conceptualized, wonderfully written masterpiece!<br /><br />Altered Carbon takes place far in the future, a time when people rely on a \\"Cortical Stack\\" to live forever. That's right, your essence can be re-sleeved in a new body, essentially keeping you alive forever - if you can afford it. Otherwise, your stack goes on ice until your family can afford to get you in virtual or a new sleeve - sleeve being a recently acquired dead body that has been altered for extended life.<br /><br />The main character of this novel is Takeshi Kovacs. He's an envoy, newly sleeved on Earth. He's been hired to solve a mystery, that unravels before the reader in a very engaging way. There is a lot of heat here. This isn't a tame novel. There is futuristic sex and drugs. It's graphic and well-written. The setting is perfectly described. Be prepared for a long novel and a journey that's difficult to put down. I fell asleep on my Kindle four times while reading this novel! It's that difficult to put away. When I did finally finish reading it, it was 1:30 in the morning!<br /><br />Overall, I really love this book. It ends neatly, with all questions answered and some real surprises. It's well-written and engaging. If you're a sci-fi fan, you can't go wrong with this surprisingly accurate look into the future. If we were going to live forever, it makes sense.

B001XUH69Y|5.0|Casablanca is simply the best movie ever made. I think that there is a generational divide to a certain extent because it was made so long ago, but a person of any age who really gets involved in the movie can always feel its true power and emotion.<br />The most beautiful woman ever, after my wife, Igrid Bergman, certainly makes the movie easy to watch - and Bogey , what a guy!!! To see Bogey change from the apparently narcisitic big man on campus to the sacrificing, earth saving guy we all knew he really was hidden underneath that rough exterior, is a masterpiece.<br />I have never written a review before but this film deserves watching - not reading about.
1594203059|2.0|This book is the third I've read by the author (ok, I'll admit, I didn't make it through the second of the three).  As other reviewers have pointed out, his writing style isn't the best.  What I didn't like about Civilization was that it read more like a train of thought than a well organized and supported thesis.  I wonder if the author is able to turn out so many long books quickly because he isn't putting a lot of time into organizing and editing them.  Ferguson also adds in numerous excerpts from other \\"important\\" historical writers and references to philosophers and scientists, etc; such usage saves him writing time and being forced to make his own points.  Sure, I feel smart when I get the reference but I'd rather get smarter from him making a really novel argument.<br /><br />I feel like a scrooge saying this, but if you're a Ferguson fan and like academic and long books with numerous references and quotes then this book is for you.  I personally didn't learn much and am still pondering whether his core thesis works or not (as he didn't support it).  There are better books, life Guns, Germs and Steel, in my opinion.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|great game lots of fun and best of all it is free. love it and I would reccomend it to all
B008XG1X18|4.0|sooo addicted to pinterest! glad there is an app for my kindle fire. cannot edit previous posts or maybe I just haven't found out how to. other than that, it is awesome!
B008HK3QII|5.0|This is a really nice idea.  Personally I've found that the smaller Kindle readers also fit just fine.<br /><br />NOT THAT IF YOU ALREADY USE A CASE on your Kindle Fire or Kindle Reader, then this will be a super snug fit and depending it may not work.  Also there is no need to use a envelope if you use a case.<br /><br />The closure is a strong Velcro.  So strong you hear that \\"rrriiiipp\\" when you open/close it.  Inside is red.<br /><br />Use your Kindle and put it in here instead of putting it in your bag/purse and getting it scratched or \\"dinged\\" up.<br /><br />It fits in like a glove, so that if it falls, you're safe.  Be realistic, we're not talking about a fall from a house.  But a fall from a table, etc.<br /><br />An idea for future production would be  a side pouch for the charger?  But that may make it too bulky?
B0072GPQNG|5.0|When I sat down to watch War Horse, I wasn't very excited about it. My daughter read the book, and she said it was excellent. She told me it was written from the viewpoint of the horse. Well, with that information in mind I concluded before the movie even started that it was going to be a waste of time, and it doesn't help that I'm not a huge fan for movies about horses.<br /><br />As soon as the movie started with Joey the horse being born and showed him fresh out of the womb, I was hooked. It follows Joey's life, from the point he was separated from his mother to a more experienced animal that understands life more so than most human beings. Joey proved to be very loyal and very brave. Even when the world was in complete hell around him and sometimes let him down, this horse never gave up. Joey stepped in for his friend, the black horse [don't know his name] time and time again, and he took the hurt and pain just so his friend wouldn't have to endure. This movie was not so much about the human caretakers, in my opinion, but the undying love, loyalty, and pain of this beautiful animal. After all, it is called War Horse, not War Human.<br /><br />I am glad I sat down to watch this movie. I like Spielberg movies anyway, and he won me over with this one, too. I laughed, I cried, and I was amazed. I think when a movie does that, it has done its job at entertaining me.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|I painfully watched the whole movie hopeing the ending would justify sitting through the whole movie, but alas, I discovered I should have shut of the movie sooner. the story is in my mind what killed the movie, for it was well was there a story?  it is definatly not your basic story line were you invest in some characters to the conclusion, for the movie seems to deviate from characters you think should be more prominant then it deviates back to them then leaves again, an focuses on something else.  my first thought after watching it was that the editor of the film must have been high on something, for basically the story is horrible put together.  don't waste your time unless you could care less about the story.

B00887490Y|4.0|All I can say is  you have to watch it,  a number of twists,  not who you think or what you think or why you think.....sorry but that's all....or I'll spoil the whole movie.  I think those who rated it it low were expectiong a horror movie, which I don't like because most are predictible and not scary.  I didn't know who Jessica Biel was untill I saw this movie.....she did a good job.
0375842209|5.0|Young adult literature is one of the perks of teaching high school.  Even if I might not be able to teach it exclusively I'm exposed to it all the time whether in the school library or through direct recommendations from my students.  The Book Thief is the kind of young adult novel that doesn't come around often and I'm a little disappointed in myself that it's taken me this long to read it.  It talks about WWII in a refeshing but heartbreaking way and Liesel Meminger's voice rings just as true as Anne Frank's did when I was in middle school.<br />Liesel, our Book Thief, is a young German girl growing up in the turmoil of WWII.  She's lost her mother for reasons she doesn't understand, buried her brother, and been forced to move and live with a strange gamily that's agreed to take her in.  While Liesel is not able to read as her story begins she has an instinctive understanding of the power of words.  She craves them, she collects them, she loses herself in them.  Liesel and her adoptive father begin a quest to teach Liesel to read as she painstakingly makes her way through the only book she has.  The more she reads the more words she craves and when her foster parents agree to hide a Jew in their basement she begins to collect his words as well as the two paint over the pages of Mein Kampf to create a new story, full of hope.<br />Liesel's story, narrated by the charming and disconcerting personified death, is hear breaking.  Something about the way Zusak writes has you caring for these characters by the end of page one even though you know the ending can't be a happy one.  While there is a large selection of excellent books surrounding the events of the Holocaust something about this one pushes it to the top.  You aren't brought inside the concentration camps or tossed into the front lines, instead Zusak brings you another kind of horror.  You are forced to see propaganda at its worst.  You must watch as Germans avert their eyes to save their families and even worse, as they begin to buy in to the Nazi propaganda for themselves.<br />Written in lyrical prose that flows from page to page it's the subject matter that makes Zusak's book hard to read and impossible to finish without shedding a tear or two.  Written in a modern style that brings this tragedy into the 21st century it may be time we see this classic replace some of the old standbys.se, as they begin to buy in to the Nazi propaganda for themselves.<br />Written in lyrical prose that flows from page to page it's the subject matter that makes Zusak's book hard to read and impossible to finish without shedding a tear or two.

B009AJDDQU|3.0|I was jazzed to begin with that a new science fiction movie was coming available.<br /><br />I am guilty of not researching the movie more thoroughly on the web before renting it.<br /><br />On the face of it, it is not obvious that it is set in the \\"Alien\\" universe. My first clue was<br />when I saw the hologram saying \\"Wayland Creating better worlds\\".<br /><br />There were some good special effects, but mostly creepy ones. It was not a bad movie,<br />just a let down that it was going to be horror and not some uplifting plot.<br /><br />I suppose it was worth renting, but I was hoping for something classy like Avatar.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Other reviewers are expressing concern over the terms of service and that is probably something worth looking into.  I dont know much about that.  I appreciate Evernote so much, and use it for goal setting and chores and scribbling notes in one spot.  I really like that there isnt a modern device that I own that doesnt have at least a decent version of Evernote.  The simplicity and power is there, theyve done their job and its really up to you to use the framework to add value to your time and devices.  Is privacy important to me?  Not really, if anybody wants to know that I need to caulk the bathtub, they can be guest.  Cheers and good luck.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is my first foray into the automatic watch world. I just want to say that the Seiko SNK809 seriously impresses me.<br /><br />I'd previously only been aware of quartz watches, and only because that's what's most common for my peers nowadays. It's this stop motion feeling as applied to watches. Tick, tick, tick... until the day is over. My current watch is more like tiktiktiktik... as if it is showing that time is continuous and fluid.<br /><br />Speaking of mechanics, my particular watch is pretty accurate. It has, in fact, a barely noticeable deviation (i.e. about 2-3 seconds gained in 3 days). I hope this continues into the future. In the meantime, the watch is very wearable; I've worn it almost 3 full days and it feels like I could wear this continuously for the next 30 years.<br /><br />Also, it is probably a good thing that I like the feel since I would wear it for 30 years; moreover, I also like the the simple styling and the nylon strap. It's not hipster at all... but it is very utilitarian.<br /><br />I highly recommend this (or the SNK 795 if you're into metal) as a starter watch.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|This movie was more predictable than most movies that I watch --- I rented this from amazon and am really glad I rented it, instead of buying it.  Hunger Games has decent acting and great photography but after awhile I found it to be a bit boring while waiting for the predictable ending.  Hunger Games has received a lot of publicity, some even compare it to Harry Poter and say its better --- I disagree with these people.  I am glad I rented it but I do not believe I will rent or buy any sequels.

B001I45UFC|5.0|I love how C.S. Lewis posits the trilemma of Mere Christianity, perhaps C.S. Lewis's most famous apologetic work, to also support the idea that Narnia exists.<br />Lucy must either be a liar, mad, or telling the truth that Narnia is real in the same way that in Mere Christianity Lewis posits that Jesus must be Lord, liar or lunatic.  Clearly, there are more possibilities than these with regard to Jesus, lest we believe every fantasy our children tell us.<br />This writing is very much secretly evangelistic, but probably not in a way most people would expect.  I feel when an evangelist presents me with the Jesus story, and declares something like that Jesus must be Lord, liar or lunatic, it is not Jesus whom I am passing judgment upon, but the witness of a fairytale presented to me.  It is thus not Jesus that must be Lord, liar or lunatic, but the person or author that presents Jesus to me that is probably liar, lunatic or telling the truth.  But, as I believe happens in the case of the Jesus story, most people that believe in fairy tales are just honestly mistaken about their tale.  That is, they are neither telling the truth, lying, or insane, but that they are just plain honestly mistaken.  When someone tells me that if I don't believe in a fairytale, such that my soul depends on it in order to escape eternal punishment, I won't sell my soul to believe in Jesus anymore than I would subscribe to the idea that Narnia is a real place.  Strangely, C.S. Lewis seems to support that idea as upright, such that entering the fantastic world of Jesus and Christianity, even if it be lies, is still ideal to the alternative of denying Christian religious fantasies.<br />Of course, Jesus was a real person, but anything beyond that is anyone's guess, and as mysterious as Narnia itself.  Three major religions have three stories about Jesus that are very much in conflict.  Christianity says that Jesus is Lord.  Judaism says that Jesus was the antichrist.  And, Islam says that Jesus was the humblest prophet, but not as great as Mohammed.  Therefore, what is to be made of this man's story is anybody's guess.  Absurdly, most Christians say that this decision is central going to either heaven or hell in the afterlife.  That much I am unable to accept.was the humblest prophet, but not as great as Mohammed.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|Seriously??  I feel like I accidentally stumbled into a \\"parallel\\" book series.  Characters were vague and undeveloped, even Reacher seemed like some stranger.  Story just had no depth.<br />The whole thing about the prison-camp-secret government facility was way out there.  If something like it actually existed, wouldn't it be a highly guarded secret?  It appeared to be just sitting there off a main highway with fencing and razor wire, etc but staffed with only three people!  Reacher and two women were able to virtually walk out with three cell phones and just \\"disappear\\".  It seemed a little lame considering the effort the author had gone to earlier in the book explaining how everyone who carried a cell phone could easily be tracked by Big Brother.<br />I pre-ordered this book in Kindle format and paid more than a decent paperback costs.  Wish I'd waited and borrowed it from a library!!  I guess authors have a right to become greedy, too.

0062020889|4.0|Fun historic adventure tale with great character development that make Follett's stories my favorite. Was a bit disappointed with the end, however - felt like he was trying to quickly wrap things up in a James Bondish kind of way. But then I read the postscript - highlight of the book IMO. Not his best book for me, but like all Follett books I've read - a great tale based on historic events. Highly recommended.

B008K5T5AI|3.0|I think it is safe to say that the Culture series has well and truly peaked (actually several books ago).<br /><br />I won't bother writing a long detailed review.  Suffice to say that I think Hydrogen Sonata is well past the peak of this fantastic series.  Had it been the first Culture book I had read, I would not bother reading any others.  I got the impression that Banks was sort of painting by numbers with this one (Inferior culture with a crisis? Check.  Irreverent Minds? Check.  Awesome weapons?  Check.  etc etc).<br /><br />If, like me, you are a die-hard Culture fan you won't regret reading this book.  But here's the thing, I can also honestly say that if you don't read it you're not missing anything.  It is not a \\"must buy\\".  If you're not (yet) a Culture fan, don't start with this book under any circumstances - you'll taint your view of one of the best SF series ever.  Go back and start with Consider Phlebas.

B0058YPL66|5.0|Couldn't be happier with my purchase!! Ordered on Wednesday received on Saturday. So quick! Probably the best experience I've had so far.
B007SGM084|5.0|very good book you should be aware it its pretty explicit!!  would recommend it to others.  hope the author writes more books
B007THA4FI|1.0|I reserved this book the moment I heard about it and anxiously awaited the release date.  It was a huge disapointment.  There are way too many characters and to make it even more difficult they are all dull and have nothing really remarkable about them.  Their names seem similar (or perhaps I was just that confused) and then adding in the various nick names for the various characters who have nothing exciting about them, I spent most of the book thinking \\"now who the hell is this?\\"  I wanted to tough it out and get through the book in case something got exciting, but it never happened.  It was a long, painful read.
B0091XIZO0|5.0|Great,great piano by Lang Lang.Just listen, the words are useless! Five bright stars for the Star of piano of our time!
B004CEUEWE|4.0|It was a pretty good movie.  A lot better than we thought it would be.  I recommend it to anyone
B001KQZ7I8|4.0|This book provides an explanation for suffering and its fruitfulness contrary to contemporary paradigm of escapism. It demonstrates how interpersonal relations can 'make' or 'break' a person in extreme situations. Frankl's experiences and his practise of logotherapy provides motivation to fight for survival and healing on all human levels - the physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual.
B0068THAGY|3.0|I would have given this movie 5 stars if it hadn't been so dark in parts that I couldn't see what was happening.  The story and the characters are good, and I liked seeing Elle Fanning in it.  I had a hard time following the story line in some parts, and it's not very clear to me why the creature had to destroy the town and so many people. I know it just wanted to go home, but the destruction didn't make a lot of sense.  Maybe if I see it again, I'll pick up more.  It is interesting and it makes you want to find out what happens to the kids, but when they are in the cave (or whatever that place is) it get confusing, which is something of a disappointment.  But I will watch it again and see if I can \\"get\\" it.  The actors are all good in their respective roles, but the plot is just sort of.. meh.<br /><br />Oh yea, and I liked Kyle Chandler in this, too. It was nice to see him again.  Joel Courtney in the lead was really engaging, too.  I would say that the actors deserve 5 stars, if only it weren't for the confusing plot.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I mostly got this movie for Theron.. it was a good movie. it was different from most movies but in a good way. I never watched any of the alien movies but now I am considering them..so over all its not a modern classic but it is deffinitly worth watching.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book depicts typical conservative small town in England. As in the Harry Potter series, Rowling is masterful in building up characters, but the storyline moves so slowly and once the expected tragidy happens, bamg, the book is over. I was left perplexed.
B007SPPANM|5.0|I am completely satisfied with this dvd. The quality, color, and special features are excellent. I never tire of watching this movie. A valued addition to my collection.
B005LAIHE0|5.0|This was funny, charming, and witty, with a touch of drama.<br /><br />Segel and Blunt had terrific chemistry and what a perfectly cast group of talented comedians.<br /><br />This really did the romantic comedy genre justice.<br /><br />This is one of those movies I'll will be watching more than once.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great mindless entertainment for my kindle fire.  The different levels of this game are fun and just challenging enough to keep me addicted.<br /><br />For a FREE app I am very impressed!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kids love this game. they play all the time. hope I can find more great kids games like this.
B000W0B0KM|5.0|This is an essential album for thrash fans, and together with \\"Worship Music,\\" it showcases one of the best thrash bands still going.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book has more twists and turns than a corkscrew.  It keeps the reader in a constant state of suspense.  Just who is the bad guy???  Love it!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Trilogy is great! My only complaint is that the author would bring something awesome to attention, but never go into detail with back story. This happened in all three books. I feel a prequel should accompany this series before it is forgotten. A story that brings to life the war and the experiments the capitol brought against the districts.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|Words cannot begin do describe how well-crafted, diverse, and simply phenomenal this album is.  Thomas Bergersen has truly created a masterpiece in modern-classical music!  The range of emotions that Mr. Bergersen fleshes out is massive and swings from one end of the spectrum to the other so seamlessly that it seems like each song is a piece to a grand musical puzzle.  The best example of this is hearing the intensity and darkness of Femme Fatale followed immediately by the heavenly and uplifting them of Homecoming.  Having said that, each piece is still amazing on their own.<br /><br />Apart from the use of a large variety of instruments from around the world, the excellent placement of electronic sounds (Reborn and Promise), and his ability to keep an 8-minute song interesing to the end (Aura and Illusions), what really drives the music is the amazing group of female vocalists that Mr. Bergersen uses throughout the majority of the album.  All of the vocalists do an incredible job of lifting the music to new heights and when backed by a coed choir and a male vocalist in Sonera, some amazing vocal moments are produced (e.g. Ocean Princess and Promise).  However, they are also more than capable of leading the song without a choir behind them as shown by the songs Remember Me and Dreammaker.<br /><br />My only issue with this album is that I cannot find the english translations to any of the songs.  I would assume that the lyrics are amazing, but I simply do not know what the translations are.  If anybody knows where the lyrics can be found, please let me know because I would love to find them.  Otherwise, I would give my highest recommendation in buying this album.  Over a short period of time, \\"Illusions\\" has certainly become my favorite of all time!  Since I bought this album and Two Steps From Hell's \\"Invincible\\" I have searched the web to find other music similar to this (Trailer Music, Modern-classical, whatever you may call it) but none of it quite reaches thebar set by Thomas Bergersen's \\"Illusions\\".  I am excited to see how Thomas Bergersen's repertoire of music will evolve as time passes.<br /><br />P.S.  This is my first review and I would like to hear comments and opinions on this review.  I am starting to take an interest in reviewing music and would like some feedback.  If you've read everything up to this point, thank you and I hope you like this album!!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I enjoyed this story and think you will too.  The characters were developed well so you really care about their story.  I would love to see a part 2!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very interesting & entertaining, read the book within a couple of days, couldn't put it down!! A must read for women!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a book that is more than just for kids!  Suzanne Collins paints quite the picture and tells quite to tell here!  You feel that you are right there with them in the games.
B008O69SZ0|3.0|Ian should step out from behind those dark glam rock shades, because he's hiding nothing here, making When I'm President the finest, most real album he's ever released.<br /><br />Nothing stands out to grab you, not the Memphis style horn arrangements, not the boogie woogie piano, or the shimmering guitars ... everything weaves in and out and together, like magic happening right before your eyes, where a splendid smile of approval is the best you can give, `cause it's all so captivating, understated and inter-related.  Each song is like falling into the arms of lover who suddenly reminds you that what-was has gotten even more intense with the comfort of no pretense.  Ian presents a whole new set of ideas here, channeling the ghost of Elvis Presley, and giving nods to Bob Dylan and Jerry Lee Lewis, tempering their visions by wrapping them in a warm blanket, and then adding a just taste of British country honk, laced with a Mick Taylor era Stones' twang.<br /><br />Ian Hunter has always been an artist who's record collection I'd love to leisurely browse, `cause there's little that hasn't influenced him ... though when his bill comes due, I don't want to be anywhere close, as the man has the ability to make nearly anything his own.  Yet for all this, he still needs a band who can make his dreams come true, a band who are not overly polished, yet can still erupt with passion and flair.  And The Rant Band do just that, balancing Hunter's intonations and tenderness, driving this album along flawlessly, lacing one song into another with undeniable substance, in a fashion usually reserved for younger bands, much like Dylan did on \\"Cold Iron Bound.\\"<br /><br />And now with \\"I Don't Know What You Want\\" fading into my ears, a song where he gives me everything I want, I'll pull up an extra cover and dance into my dreams ... satisfied and safe.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B008IYN9P8|4.0|Dexter tends to start a bit slow each season, defining new characters, and setting up the big serial-murderer scenario arc that carries through the season. This season is no exception. By now, the recurring characters are well-known to Dexter fans. A new forensics intern and Bastista's sister are introduced, both recurring. If you enjoyed previous seasons of Dexter, you'll enjoy this one. It gets pretty creepy!
B0098VXE50|5.0|I wasn't really sure that I would like this but I took a chance after reading several reviews. Snow White makes you think of a kids fairy tale, but this is an adult feature that I think was well done. The underlying story of Snow White is there including the dwarfs. There is CGI of course, but it is only used when needed for effect and fairy tales parts that we all know are not real. The main story line relates to the human side of good verse evil,the Queen and soldiers against Snow White and the Villagers. I really thought the movie was done up right and would recommend it for an adult as I think that it would be too scary for a minor.
B009CPRZ9I|5.0|This was a great movie! It was the best adaptation to a book I've ever seen. I cant wait for Part 2 come out this winter.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I get on this application whenever my kindle is on low. Spot on accurate! Ive never had a problem! Gives you how long you can do each thing!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|this cd is great - as usual with anything dylan it requires a few listens to the whole album to get it into your mind but it is dylan and he is the best
B006LSZECO|4.0|My book club chose this book. The beginning of the book was confusing for me and I thought I have to get through this for my meeting so I kept reading and things became really interesting.  I could not put the book down! It has so many twists and weird turns and kept me intrigue about how it would end.  I was thoroughly entertained by this \\"murder\\" mystery.
B000IHY146|5.0|I give this album 5 stars because Karen Dalton was unique, a singer who could evoke the heart and soul of folk music.I knew Karen back in the golden days of folk music and she was the real deal in every way. Had she lived and overcome her demons she would be right up there with anyone you can think of. The album is a mixed blessing, even though Karen's singing isn't. It's a product of its time, with arrangements of background music that do little to add to Karen and a lot to get in her way. It was an attempt to take her to the \\"commercial\\" level, i.e., sell records.<br /><br />The opening song is killer. \\"Something's on your mind\\" is one of Karen's greatest interpretations and shows the real power and emotion she could bring to her music. I defy you to listen to this without being moved by it. \\"Katy Cruel\\" appears on all her few recorded offerings and is an example of folk music in it's purest, best sense. If you love folk music you really should have this album. Karen is an unsung legend. I miss her.
B005H0IW6W|2.0|There are a few great tracks, particularly the numbers with big band (Winter Wonderland, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming to Town). The arrangements are generally interesting, well orchestrated, extremely well performed, well recorded/mixed. This is obviously a big time production, and refreshing that a few artists still use real musicians playing real instruments.<br /><br />But what is with all the autotune? Michael Buble can sing. Why is he auto-tuned to death? Whoever did that made a great singer sound like 'autotune the news'. Idiosyncrasies in pitch are part of what make peoples voice sound unique, and pitch is a part of style. When a producer obliterates the musicality and styling of a real singer who has trained their voice all their life, it's an absolute shame. Autotune should be used sparingly to fix problem spots and made to be inaudible. You can't just slap it on the whole track. If this was an original and the artist was shooting for the style and sound of modern pop (for some reason), then I wouldn't mind as much. But using heavy autotune with classic styles like blues, swing, and traditional songs is totally out of character. I can't believe a production at this level would do this. Everything else about the mixes are fabulous, but the autotune totally ruins it for me. I'll be keeping a few tracks from this album where the autotune is almost bearable, and I will just have to cringe occasionally.<br /><br />Why do modern producers compress and autotune the **** out of vocals? Dynamics and pitch are integral to music. When the whole band drops out, the vocal shouldn't be just as loud as it is on top of the shout chorus. Slapping automatic compression settings and autotune over the entire track is lazy. You would be better off using your ears and writing in some volume automation instead of just reducing the dynamic range of everything.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|product downloaded to my ipad 2 without any problems using the free app. Only problem was I couldn't figure out how to watch it on my TV with the hdmi attachments. Only audio came out, no video so had to watch it on my Mac computer. The good thing is the rental can be watched on ipad or the mac without transferring rental and its good for 48 hrs. Not like Itunes only 24 hrs. So I gave it 4 stars.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|enjoy having fun!<br />This an easy game that takes little intense time. Able to put down and pick up again. interesting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|calculator plus is awesome<br />calculator plus is cool<br />and it is fast it works hard and doesn't stop working for you
0345803485|5.0|I had heard the buzz about this book but was sure that I would find it a total turn off and was anticipating the scathing review I would write. Instead I found convincing and complex characters...sexy scenes and realistic reactions. I had a few issues with details of the book but overall I was riveted and finished it in 7 hours. The next two books are already on order!!
B000002H97|1.0|seriously who would Listen to this junk besides prepubescent boys.  This isn't rock or metal, this is just junk that should never have been made. Songs on here Like enter sandman and sad but true are just sad pathetic pieces of crap, in fact the whole album is crap.  Yes I hate metallica from this album forward and I think they should retire or just die.  Anyone who Likes this this band doesn't know anything about true good music.
B000OLTBL4|5.0|Very good Movie for those who like Dragons. Very good for for young adults also. I listened to the whole series of books and this movie follows events in the book pretty closely. So many movies don't. Definitely a movie I want to own and watch over and over.
B005RJ6AIK|4.0|Just saw the movie tonight, I was surprized to hear one after another through the entire movie great soothing instrumental music. Having being an admirer of slack key music for a great sometime and only recently began learning to play, this form of music is easy on the ears.... The backdrop of Hawaii was great. Movie - line -- so so.... I would recomend this movie just to hear the music........
B004P12SSW|5.0|I was hesitant about watching this movie. I really didn't know who Christina Aguilera was although I grew up with Cher.  I was extremely surprised and delighted with the movie and the music.  The premise of the movie is totally believable and the acting was very well done. The dancing and the music is spectacular and Cher does an amazing job.
B000S0GYRU|2.0|This was supposed to be the greatest horror movie of all time?
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Outstanding story! Started Crossfire series after reading Fifty Shades of Grey series....I think this story is a home run! Can't wait for the third and hoping a movie will be in the works!
0847835073|5.0|An excellent overview about how great photographers look at the same celebrity. Good printing and very \\"chic\\" finished book[[ASIN:B008HDEQHA Monica Bellucci]].
B002MQYOFW|4.0|this is an easy read ..and very entertaining. Not an easy book to put down I would recommend this for light reading and look forward to reading the next 2 books related to this one.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This story started slow for me, but will draw you in to a decades old mystery, that is filled with complex characters and hidden agendas. When Mikael Blomkvist is hired to write a family history, and try to solve an old mystery, he doesn't realize to what lengths some family members will go to keep their secrets hidden. With the help of Lisbeth Salander, a computer hacker with extraordinary talents, they get involved in more than they bargained for. Plenty of action and well developed characters, make this a superb first rate story that will leave you thinking long after it is over. A thrill ride that escalates slowly and will take you on the ride of a lifetime.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|After reading Thirteen Reasons Why, it made me think a lot more about life and how I treat others. So many people take lifefor granted and just expect every day to happen. In reality, nobody is guranteed another day. Jay Asher wrote his first book with no flaws. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a book in one sitting.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so addicting I can't stop playing! I may actually fail all my classes, but it will be worth it!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|If you have ever been a fan of the Alien franchise, or Ridley Scott, you must watch this movie. Don't ask why, just watch. When you're done watching Prometheus, turn on Alien. It will Segway perfectly and leave you wanting more!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|If you enjoy loud, heavy, upbeat, badass rock and roll, then this album is perfect for you.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" starts off with \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\", a very energetic fast paced song with a great guitar riff and guitar solo. Paul Stanley's vocals are clearly not what they once were, but considering the circumstances, it still sounds damn good. In my opinion one of the weaker tracks on the album though.<br /><br />\\"Wall Of Sound\\" is one of the best tracks on the album, with a thunderous heavy guitar riff that rips through your speakers while Gene's scream reminds you of Creatures of the Night. A great song for any hard rock/heavy metal fan. One of my favorites on the album.<br /><br />\\"Freak\\" is one of the more odd songs I've heard by KISS, it's catchy don't get me wrong, but it's just a little out there. The guitar riff is solid, the song flows nicely but in my opinion one of the weaker songs on the album.<br /><br />\\"Back to the Stone Age\\" is just a fun, upbeat, cool song. The guitar riff is smash mouth in your face from the very beginning, with cool lyrics and vocals by Gene here. The background singing of Back to the stone age\\" is very nice and it just makes you wanna sing along and bang your head at the same time. This song is one word: fun.<br /><br />\\"Shout Mercy\\" is a catchy song that can grow on ya, the double pump by Eric Singer here is cool. It's one of those cool little songs you can snap your fingers to and sing along with at the same time. Just a nice upbeat little rocker that will grow on ya.<br /><br />\\"Long Way Down\\" is probably the slowest song on the album, not that it's really all that slow of a song anyways. It's still pretty heavy, but was the song I liked the least on the album. It has its moments when Paul sings \\"It's a long way down, when the grounds starts comin\\" and then it transitions into the guitar solo. Overall a decent song but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />\\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" kind of reminded me of \\"Hot and Cold\\" from Sonic Boom. Just a great guitar riff followed by great vocals by Gene, along with great background vocals by the whole band. The guitar solo absolutely smokes and grooves all the way through with perfection. If you're not snapping your fingers or tapping your feet to this I'd be surprised. It's that good, probably my favorite song on the album.<br /><br />\\"The Devil Is Me\\" is another great Gene song, my has his voice aged well. He can still growl and scream at the top of his lungs like he did at times in the 80's and 90's. There's nothing like the heavy thunderous guitars and bass while Gene screams with a real porpoise. If this song were a person, you wouldn't mess with it.<br /><br />Tommy's song \\"Outta this world\\" flows similarly to \\"When Lightning Strikes\\" from Sonic Boom, and is just about as good as that song. It starts with a nice little guitar intro as Tommy sings in between rhythm guitar riffs, the guitar solo is nice. It's a catchy song from start to finish and a solid tune from the album.<br /><br />\\"All For the Love of Rock and Roll\\" is just a feelgood rock song that's straight from the 70's. It has a very \\"Peter Criss\\" like feel to it, and probably for good reason. It's a song that will have to grow on you with time, but you'll be snapping your fingers after a couple listens.<br /><br />\\"Take Me Down Below\\" is another of the gems on the album, the guitar riff starts off smoking. Gene starts the song singing with a deep voice, and abruptly switches to that epic scream. Then it's Paul's turn and the background vocals flow well. The guitar solo starts off with a duel riff and transitions nicely into a smoking solo. It's just a great song from the start to the finish.<br /><br />\\"Last Chance\\" is great, it's a fast paced song as Paul sings \\"This is your last chance to getttt it right, do your dance on the edge of the knife\\". Along with the background vocals that remind you of \\"Russian Roulette\\" from Sonic Boom or \\"Thunderstruck\\" by AC/DC. The song is fast pacedand you just can't help but raise your fist as the song progresses.<br /><br />Overall this album is great, nothing less than that. The energy for a group of guys that are as old as they are is really amazing. You can tell they enjoyed making this album, cause the music is just plain fun to listen to. If you enjoyed KISS' music of the 70's, this will exceed your expectations.and you just can't help but raise your fist as the song progresses.<br /><br />Overall this album is great, nothing less than that.

B004S5C91Q|5.0|Wonderful. Topical and compelling. Interesting to explore one interpretation of how a captive might find the resources and imagination to cope with such a catastrophic personal event, and find a way to raise a child in this toxic environment. I enjoyed every page.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett has always been one of my favorite authors.  If you have enjoyed his previous books, then you will definitely want to read this trilogy.  He does a great job developing this assortment of characters, and once you get started it is difficult to put this book down.  I blew through the first 2 books, and am excited for the third to come out!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I liked this one the best out of the three. But I started to flip pages and skim over to get to something more interesting.
B006IYFCIM|4.0|People always cheating, we always suspect it. But what makes it different from person to person? Just small nicks in prior situation can fork the outcomes.<br /><br />The studies themselves shown in the book are interesting but are not quite diversified like the author's previous books. Maybe it's because the topic is not broad for discussion and testing as [[ASIN:0061353248 Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions]].<br /><br />You can find the proofs to some of your belief about cheating here and hope it is a starting point for preventing cheating in society.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game my son chase thinks its just awsome so I Tride it for my self and got adicted!!!
B0083SBM7Q|3.0|very misleading. bonus features on Blueray disc only....not on DVD. description of two disc set says both discs are the same. they are NOT. DVD version DOES NOT have deleted scenes or gag reel. major bummer.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Could not even make myself finish this book. How I got through the first two I will never understand. So many better things to read and do than to waste my time finishing this book.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|Will often just hang/freeze with the loading circle Icon. I often have to kill the task and open it again to make it work.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|This movie was highly rated and I wanted to see it.<br />It is an unsettling concept.  The movie had plenty of action and a decent plot.  Movie can be considered disturbing and may not be enjoyed by everyone.<br />The actors and actresses did an excellent job playing the roles.<br />I would not watch it again, but it does make you think about things.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This story is always moving. Because of the nonstop forward progression and action, it's a quick read, even though it's over 500 pages.<br /><br />I really like Reacher. Finlay is also a favorite character for me. All of the characters are well developed and believable, villains and good guys alike. The town of Margrave is realistic and easily visualized. The dialogue is smooth and extremely well written. The book reads as a good book should, like a movie in your mind.<br /><br />The end is well done with Reacher continuing his wandering lifestyle. I'm already anticipating the second in the series, Die Trying.<br /><br />I've heard tell of a movie in the works with Tom Cruise as Reacher. I have a hard time seeing Cruise as Reacher. Reacher is described as 6'5\\" in height and Cruise is short. I hope they rethink that.<br /><br />There is minimal coarse language. You won't find the \\"f\\" word anywhere. There is sexual content, which is brief and minimally described. It's not graphic by any stretch. There is a lot of fairly graphic violence.<br /><br />I read purely for entertainment and I was thoroughly entertained. The Killing Floor gets 5 stars from me without hesitation.
0525953728|5.0|This book truly is amazing. It's full of details about the training of Navy SEALS and the commitment they have to doing the jobs they are assigned. It's full of bravery and determination -- and the care of each other. The details of getting to Osama Bin Laden and killing him are astounding. The book makes you look at yourself closely to see if you have any of the \\"right stuff.\\" For the majority of us I'm sure it's NO. Thank God for the SEALS ...
0767818040|2.0|Aside from anything else that is good or bad, routine or entertaining about this film, I can't be the only one who was completely unable to get past the fact that, in the big murder scene, both the hero and the victim act more stupefyingly idiotic than any characters in the lowest-grade teen slasher ever made.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Downloaded the amazon mobile app onto my Acer a700 (at least I went to the right place on amazon and \\"purchased\\" it), but it told me to go to the amazon mobile app store \\"to download and install it.\\". Did that (pressed all kinds of buttons, anyway) and still nothing.  I'm an android rookie, but have 30+ years building, using and teaching PC applications.  I get it, androids are NOT PC's -- but I can't believe I can't figure this out using simple logic and the instructions that go with the app.  Very frustrated at this point.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I have been using this app on my Kindle Fire HD (7&quot;) for about two months.  Excellent app.  I have the paid version, it is clear without becoming pixelted.  Crisp and clear on an HD tablet.  Have issue with the ability to have any widgets work.  More of a Kindle issue than a app issue.  I have three paid weather apps and this is the best one.  Wish it had a home screen app that was a weather clock that would stay on when plugged it.  Definately would recommend.
B007IX383I|2.0|I only discovered this band the other day, and I was amazed by their previous album We're Here Because We're Here.  I eagerly downloaded this album as well, but sadly it's just not as good.  The track \\"Beginning and the End\\" is pretty good, but as for the rest of it... meh.  Honestly, this sounds more like Riverdance than prog rock.<br /><br />I'm still pretty interested in this band, so I think I'm going to keep digging into their back catalogue, but I don't see much reason to give more time to this one.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|great book,couldn't put it down. the writing itself was  easy to read . the story was captivating and kept me hungry for more
B00594XOZU|3.0|i wish this would be a lower version. i hear its good on devices that can download it. id love to downoald it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I just love it! This game is addicting! Very fun game. I have nine more words to go. Goobly goo.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Watch only if you agree there is no hope and we all all gonna die. Not even God cares according to this. Do not watch if already depressed.
B007THA4FI|4.0|As a reader of the entier Harry Potter series (twice) I already knew J.K Rowling was a writer who could grab you & keep you interested, but I was curious how she would handle a different kind of story.  In my opinion, it was harder to get into the story (Harry Potter books were engrossing from page 1), but once I got into it I wanted to keep reading, and the expansion of the story was surprising and went in directions I didn't expect. So I would definitely recommend this book and look forward to anything new from this author.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|This is a good short read for anyone. It‘s silly and yet partially true. I recommend this book who wants a short comic and fun read. It has some adult material though, so it‘s mostly for teens and adults. Otherwise a good read for most ages.
0446691437|5.0|This is the ultimate get off your buts book and get to your goals by recognizing and dealing with the ever pervasive \\"resistance\\" killer of dreams. I read this in two days and by the end of week two I had rented a shared office, sorted through years of articles clipped for inspiration which were only taking up space, and rewritten my goals.<br /><br />I have read many books as a professional artist and this is one which deeply resonated with my personal styles of procrastination. He uncovers the many insidious ways resistance works to defeat us. If you are self employed or want to be you need this in your library. My daughter is reading it now and I already see the changes she is making!

B0041D843M|4.0|Even though there're some people find some flaws in this book, its information is good enough for me to decide make a minor change in my diet by reducing meat intake and no more dairy products (better safe than sorry). Having read the book, now I know why milk sometimes upsets my stomach.<br /><br />Regardless of how the book has changed my diet, there're several things that utterly disappoint me. First of all, the author obsessively promotes a plant-based diet against a animal-based one to a degree of overkill. Which results in a lack of other aspects of nutrition.<br /><br />This book doesn't talk about the effects of sugar on the human body. Which is an important subject that every nutrition book should talk about. And the book implies (or states clearly?...I don't remember) that vitamin supplements do not work, but the lack of clarity really makes me confused. I also expected to read information regarding fish which is a good source of protein. But there's none. It seems to me that the author thinks that every kind of protein is bad regardless of it source.

B004T4KQJS|1.0|Lots of words about time and space and popping into existence but misses the philosophical question he poses.  Reminds me of asking someone \\"What time is it?\\" and they respond by telling you how to make a fine Swiss watch but never actually give you the time.

0525952926|1.0|This book is so tedious because Follet's leftist pacifist world overshadows the story. I'm used to reading around an author's ideology if the character development and story line is good enough. This one isn't. Very simplistic. Not neatly as good as earlier novels. I will probably finish this book but I will not buy another one.
B0000028RR|2.0|If you traveled back into the late 90's and early 00's, and asked me what favorite band was, I'd quickly answer Rage Against the Machine.  Especially around 2002 up to around 2004, I drank up the Kool-Aid and bought into their political views and thought their music was the epitome of metal music (little did I know that I was terribly mistaken into thinking that RATM was a metal band).  I thought RATM's lyrics were the gospel of truth, and took up a textbook liberal agenda.  I'm glad that around 2005 and '06 that I quit drinking the RATM Kool-Aid, started listening to REAL metal music, and have a more moderate political perspective.  Anyway, on to the review.<br /><br />To be fair, this album is one of the more tolerable rap-metal albums out there, certainly above the likes of Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Hollywood Undead, Papa Roach, Crazytown, and even Biohazard.  Though even with that taken into account, this album is mediocre at best.<br /><br />MUSICIANSHIP<br /><br />Zach de la Rocha is the weakest link on this album.  His attempts at rapping are pretty laughable, as he's pretty nasally and melodramatic in his delivery.  He was much better suited in the hardcore band Inside Out.  I think Zach performs best when he's not trying to rap and calms down a little.  I think some of his most annoying moments on this album are the last few minutes in \\"Killing in the Name,\\" most of \\"Bombtrack,\\" and most of \\"Fistful of Steel.\\"  Zach actually does well in the song \\"Settle for Nothing,\\" as it shows that he can deliver angry yet competent vocals that actually vary in emotion.<br /><br />The rhythm section is competent, and I especially like Timmy C.'s bass.  I really dig the funky tone he brings to a lot of songs.  Tim's best bass is on the songs \\"Take the Power Back\\" (which reminded me a bit of the Seinfeld theme) and the first minute or so of \\"Know Your Enemy.\\"  It's a shame that Tim played in this band, because I think he'd be a good fit in a funk-jazz fusion band or even a well-done funk-rock band.<br /><br />I have some mixed feelings about Tom Morello.  He's fairly competent, but he's way, way overrated as a guitarist.  Out of all his guitar performances in Rage Against the Machine's career, I'd have to say that he does his best in this album, since this was before he fully embraced his signature \\"whammy peddle/goofy sound effects\\" type of guitar solos and delivered more traditional solos that actually sound quite good.  Yes, I know that Morello's brand of guitar solos is supposed to be \\"unique,\\" but unique doesn't always equal good.  In songs like \\"Killing in the Name\\" and \\"Bullet in the Head\\" that have the \\"noise\\" solos, they just sound goofy.  However, in songs like \\"Take the Power Back\\" and \\"Township Rebellion,\\" Morello shows that he can make some cool solos.  There's been debate that the main riff in \\"Wake Up\\" is ripped from Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir,\\" and I'm inclined to believe that Morello was feeling lazy that day and decided to rip off the LZ song (though I can make a separate argument that Led Zeppelin ripped off a lot of old blues musicians, but that's another kettle of fish).<br /><br />Brad Wilk's drumming is okay.  He establishes a competent rhythm, though not many of his performances have struck out at me.  Though I guess the end of \\"Killing in the Name\\" has a good delivery of aggressive beats.<br /><br />SONGS<br /><br />The quality of the songs on this album is all over the place.  \\"Settle for Nothing\\" is easily the best song on this album.  It's actually reserved and shows good use of dynamics in emotion and tone.  Not many RATM fans seem to like this song, but I quite like it.  The band shifts from more quiet openings to exploding into some corrosive hard rock, that actually features a tuneful guitar solo in the last quarter of the song.  It's also refreshing to hear Zach not rap.  \\"Township Rebellion\\" is also pretty solid, as it's one of the stronger \\"aggressive\\" songs on here, and the solo in it is awesome.<br /><br />\\"Take the Power Back\\" is a middle-ground song since the instrumental work is really solid in this one, but Zach's vocals kinda bring it down (though these are more tolerable than in some other songs).<br /><br />The rest of the songs just seem mediocre.  \\"Bombtrack,\\" \\"Killing in the Name,\\" \\"Bullet in the Head,\\" and \\"Know Your Enemy\\" are fan favorites, but these aren't terribly good.  It's just too goofy to hear Zach rap \\"Yo, it's just another bombtrack!\\" and while I'm not the least bit offended by profanity, the last moments in \\"Killing in the Name\\" overuses the f-bomb to the point where it looses its punch pretty fast.  \\"Know Your Enemy\\" is a pretty annoying song, especially with the guest vocals by Maynard James Keenan of Tool fame, and the fact that the riffs just seem phoned-in.  \\"Bullet in the Head\\" is another song with bland riffage and annoying guitar screeches.  \\"Fistful of Steel\\" has competent instrumental work, but this one has some of Zach's more obnoxious vocals in this one, though the solo is pretty cool.  \\"Wake Up\\" is famous for being featured at the end of The Matrix (yuck), and it's probably my least favorite song on the album as it has clear riff plagiarism from Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\" and the instrumental work is annoying.  \\"Freedom\\" is the album closer, and while being more varied in tone, it's just kinda so-so.  The song is famous for the quiet sections of Zach saying \\"Anger is a gift.\\"  Someone should have told him to use it wisely.<br /><br />PRODUCTION<br /><br />This album has a good production and sound quality to it.  Everything comes in crystal clear, and the accent to Timmy C.'s slap bass helps to make the album tolerable in some points.<br /><br />POLITICS<br /><br />Keep in mind that I'm not adding or deducing points with the politics in this album, I'm just elaborating on the phoniness of them.  I think it's funny that RATM has spent their career screaming their political agendas at the top of their lungs, claiming to be among those who are standing up to big corporations and the system, yet they were making money hand over fist with the help of big corporations and taking full advantage of the freedoms provided by the system.  It also doesn't help that most of the people in the band (particularly Zach de la Rocha) came from pretty wealthy upbringings, making their messages about justice and oppression seem so phony.<br /><br />Compare that to the fiery music and lyrics penned by Napalm Death circa 1985 and '86, when the band at the time consisted of three lower-middle class angry teenagers from Birmingham, England.  To me, their politically-charged music and lyrics from early Napalm Death feel more authentic and genuine, while the politically-charged music from RATM feels fake in comparison.<br /><br />I know that Tom Morello said in interviews that they signed to a major label to quickly get their message across to a wide audience, but even with that in account, if these guys really cared about their political agenda, they would have only kept enough of their earnings to live a middle class life, using the rest to fund organizations they believe in.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />This is NOT the angry, politically-charged hard rock masterpiece Sony, MTV, and Rolling Stone magazine wants you to think it is.  If you want politically-charged albums that are either more convincing in their political/social views or just makes much better music, invest your time and money on these instead.<br /><br />Ice Cube:  AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted<br />Public Enemy:  It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back<br />Living Colour:  Vivid<br />Napalm Death:  Scum<br />Fall of Because:  Life is Easy<br />Discharge:  Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing><br />\\"Take the Power Back\\" is a middle-ground song since the instrumental work is really solid in this one, but Zach's vocals kinda bring it down (though these are more tolerable than in some other songs).<br /><br />The rest of the songs just seem mediocre.  \\"Bombtrack,\\" \\"Killing in the Name,\\" \\"Bullet in the Head,\\" and \\"Know Your Enemy\\" are fan favorites, but these aren't terribly good.

B009CPES4I|5.0|Fantastic story and acting. Rarely do you come away from a movie so moved and appreciative of the bittersweetness of life. A must see.
B004SGWYW4|1.0|I've heard a lot of things about High School of the Dead, but mostly how it's a combination of zombie horror and anime fan service. I wasn't really expecting anything good since a few respectable anime fans confirmed that I'd hate it, but out of morbid curiosity and the fact that I was able to watch this for free, I spend a day watching it and holy moly, this is among the worst of the worst in anime.<br /><br />I loathe this so badly, I now consider it the second worst anime I've ever seen, right behind Elfen Lied.<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />High School of the Dead focuses on a group of teenagers in a high school that soon find themselves in the middle of a zombie outbreak in Japan. They must band together to survive and possibly even find the truth behind the zombie outbreak.<br /><br />TONAL INCONSISTENCY<br /><br />This is one of the most tonally-inconsistent anime titles I've ever seen in my life. The tonal inconsistency is the biggest \\"death sentence\\" for this anime. There's so many scenes in this anime that switch tones and visual styles at the drop of a hat. At one moment, you'll see really gruesome killings at the hands of zombies and right afterward, you'll see dumb, over-exaggerated faces, nosebleed gags, and way too much ecchi comedy. It's like the writers that created this anime couldn't decide between making a zombie series or a high school teenage dramedy, so they took the worst route imaginable and mashed the two together, and they mesh about as well as two ferocious streetdogs fighting for dumpster scraps.<br /><br />I swear it's almost like the people who wrote this anime were trying to outdo Elfen Lied in terms of horrible tonal shifts. Among the worst examples of the bad tonal shifts is the episode where all the female characters bathe together and aren't the least bit hesitant to grab each others' unmentionables and spraying each other with shower heads. Aside from this not being sensually appealing or funny, it's followed by a man and his daughter trying to hide from the zombies, and the dad gets killed, followed with the girl crying over her dad's dead body. Another example of odd tonal shifts is that the nurse has a brief fantasy of herself as a maid cleaning her friend's apartment, which doesn't fit in with the fact that there's zombies all over the place, killing people. Even worse is that there cartoon-ish \\"bouncing\\" sound effects and other sound effects that are more appropriate for a Looney Tunes short than a \\"mature\\" anime centered around a zombie outbreak. The tonal shifts and changes in serious to silly visual styles harmed this anime so badly, that I was totally unengaged by anything else and was just waiting out until the end.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />There was no creativity in the way the characters were made. None of them have much nuance beyond the most base stereotypes, and this makes them unlikeable and especially uninteresting. Among the worst characters in this anime is the nurse (characters are forgettable to the point of not remembering names). She's dumber than a coffee can full of nails and whines a lot about everything, yet the students take her with, despite the fact that's she's practically nothing but dead weight. This shows that this anime is without much logic, either, as the nurse is beyond stupid yet is somehow holding a job healing minor ailments that befall students at school. Another among the worst stereotypes is the chubby geek (I think his name is Kota), as he represents all the worst stereotypes of ostracized kids due to his unhealthy fixation on guns and his choice to wear black clothing. Easily among the most annoying characters is the pink-haired one, since she has an ego bigger than Kanye West's (she's always claiming to be a genius) yet proves to be useless in 99% of the anime, and is further damaged for the fact that she's just a cookie-cutter caricature of over-achieving honor students (uptight, belittling others, and constantly harping over her intellectual prowess).<br /><br />PRETENTIOUSNESS<br /><br />Aside from the fact that this anime is rampant with bad tonal shifts, it also doesn't help that in terms of its themes and overall story, it wants to have its cake and eat it, too. So much of the time is spent in this anime trying to be a constant vehicle for fanservice to appeal to teenage male anime fans, yet there's hints of it trying to be higher than what it is as it also tries to make commentary about whether or not the real monsters are the humans or zombies (highlighted by the hysterical school teacher who tries to form a cult with some of the surviving students). Instead of adding depth to the anime, it just feels like tacked-on social commentary thrown in there to make this anime seem smarter than it really is.<br /><br />This anime goes even further into pretentious territory where there's a segment that tries to tie in the storyline of this anime with Mutiny on the Bounty. This scene didn't make the anime anymore \\"artistically-developed,\\" but just trying too hard to be more than something stupid.<br /><br />LACK OF ORIGINALITY<br /><br />One of the things that struck me the most about High School of the Dead is that it's nothing but a salad bowl of all the most base cliches from the anime genre.<br /><br />Lots of jejune violence? Check.<br />Majority of female characters are schoolgirls? Check.<br />Unimaginative character personalities? Check.<br />Lots of unfunny ecchi comedy? Check.<br />Half-baked storyline? Check.<br />Lots of redundant fanservice? Double check.<br />Half-baked ending? Check.<br /><br />It's apparent that none of the people who made this anime wanted to make something that was a labor of love or to add anything of artistic merit to the anime genre. They just looked at all the most lucrative aspects to anime and mashed them together.<br /><br />ACTION SCENES<br /><br />With this being an anime that's supposed to be heavy on zombie-slaying action, this didn't deliver at all. Despite the plentiful action scenes, the absolute dearth of quality character development or character personalities stripped away all tension in these scenes. The way these scenes are made are so predictable, as there's plenty of scenes where you think one of the main characters is going to get eaten by the zombies, there's a \\"deus ex machina\\" moment where the zombie(s) in question get slain before they can infect one of the main characters. I should have kept count when these scenes occurred, but there's more than enough to take away any tension. Not that this would have helped out a lot since the clashing tones damage this anime beyond repair, but it would have helped if the writers were more creative and had one or two of the main characters die off. I should also point out how absurd some of the action scenes are, since there's a scene where one of the guys runs out of ammo during a fight with the zombies and grabs the brown-haired girl's gun, but because of the strap attached to her, he has to push her down and sandwich his arms between her chest. Does there really need to be this much blatant fanservice? I rolled my eyes at least twice when this occurred.<br /><br />BAD HUMOR<br /><br />Now you must be saying \\"Can't you just get over yourself and enjoy the action and ecchi humor for what it is?\\" I answer with a gigantic \\"NO!\\" The humor in this totally lacks creativity, since these types of ecchi jokes have been repeated ad nauseum in previous anime, and they don't do any good (especially for folks like me, who have a giant disdain for anime comedy as it is). If I wanted humor, I'll go watch some Angry Grandpa videos or Dumb and Dumber. Speaking of that, I swear there was a gag that was ripped off from that hilarious movie. There's a scene where the group leader saves a little girl from the zombies and is carrying her on his back, and she has to go to the bathroom, and because she couldn't hold it in, she wets herself and the guy's back. That scene was funny in Dumb and Dumber, but not in this.<br /><br />APPEARANCE<br /><br />The animation and artwork certainly had a lot of time and effort put into it, but good visuals alone NEVER make a worthwhile anime. Despite being a huge technical achievement, this is easily Madhouse's worst creation thus far. To think the same studio that cranked out Perfect Blue and Battle Angel also made this.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />The background music in this anime was pretty forgettable, and the music in the intro wasn't any good. It's just pop-rock that doesn't fit at all with an anime centered around an apocalyptic zombie attack.<br /><br />MATURE CONTENT<br /><br />There's a great deal of gore in this anime. There's plenty of bloodshed and of people getting eaten by zombies, and even some dismemberment. The nudity and sensual content isn't at all extreme for me, since there weren't any female parts totally exposed, as the animators were chickens and conveniently covered up any private areas, in which the scenes are as absurd as the comedic censoring in the Austin Powers movies.<br /><br />Since there's so many scenes with fanservice and absurd female behavior, this anime totally reeks of misogyny (no points were added or deducted for allegations of misogyny, these are merely observations), yet I'd bet a dozen Snickers bars that the anime fans gushing over High School of the Dead would quickly smash Doomed Megalopolis for allegations of misogynistic content.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />If you're looking for Japanese animation to feed into your most personal fantasies of women, man up and get some Bible Black DVDs instead (or watch BB on the internet). Bible Black goes all the way with its \\"mature content\\" and as a whole, is much more enjoyable than HOTD since even though its animated erotica, it still manages to maintain a pretty serious, consistent tone and with semi-competent story and character development.<br /><br />If you want adult anime containing artistic merit, check these titles out instead.<br /><br />Shigurui: Death Frenzy<br />Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne<br />Doomed Megalopolis<br />Perfect Blue<br />Battle Angel<br />Wicked City<br />Ninja Scroll<br />Ergo Proxy<br />Ghost in the Shell<br />Armitage III<br /><br />High School of the Dead is horrifying for many reasons, but actually being a scary anime series isn't one of them.te the plentiful action scenes, the absolute dearth of quality character development or character personalities stripped away all tension in these scenes.

B007ZI06FE|5.0|I started this book towards the end of a long haul flight that just seemed endless. I wasn't really motivated to start reading the book as I couldn't remember why I had downloaded the book a while back - but I was out of entertainment options. Best decision ever !  I almost didn't want the plane to land. This book is a perfect mix of steampunk, vampires and romance. I actually thought I had had enough of vampire novels, but wrong, this book has a new and interesting take on vampires. What I enjoyed most was the pace the relationship between the 2 main characters developed - just perfect ! I really do hope that Honor and Blake will be a mayor part of the next book eventhough a new romance is simmering.

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I saw this film in theaters and loved it. It was not as good as Alien but it was worth a theatrical viewing. If you like Sci Fi and breathtaking images, well then this film is for you. Some of the acting was great:Example: Michael Fassbender. Some of the other actors performances were good too, but, not as well as his. The blu ray is excellent with over 7 hours of bonus material. The 4 disc collector's edition is the one to buy. Pay the extra 5 dollars. Can't really say anything more. Such a great release for a Ridley Scott film.

0553386794|5.0|Power is arguably the most influential five letter word in the English language.  Empires have been built and destroyed based upon the illusion of power alone.  Whether the power is factual or an illusion, the people wielding it have the ability to do great good and great evil.  In the book, A Game of Thrones, we can see how the word power affects people and to what extremes they will go to achieve their desired level of status.<br /> In the beginning of the book, we are introduced to four families:  the Starks, the Lannisters, the Baratheons, and the Targaryens.  Each of these represent a major player in the struggle for power through the story.  The Starks are the embodiment of what it means to be a family of nobility.  They are bound by honor, duty, and loyalty.  The Lannisters are a family driven by the lust and greed for power.  Their twisted sense of honor is dictated by their motto, \\"a Lannister always pays his debts.\\"  What is left of the Targaryens are the product of a dynasty driven mad by power.  The Baratheons seem to be the true losers in this tale, as their house is divided and destroyed as a result of attaining the crown.<br /> Eddard Stark is the lord of Winterfell and seems happy with his status.  That is until his friend and king, Robert Baratheon, asks him to be the hand of the king.  It is through his sense of duty, to not only the king but his friend, that he should leave his home and become the second most powerful man in the realm.  Due to his new found station Eddard discovers a truth about Robert's children that ultimately costs him his life.  Even though it is said \\"truth is power,\\" his honor forces him to make the grave mistake of warning his enemies to leave before he reveals the truth to Robert.<br /> Robert Baratheon is a warrior turned king who overthrew the Targaryen dynasty.  His rebellion is one based in vengeance from what he sees as a power-hungry and bloodthirsty family.  Once he is made king, he finds that his dealings in ruling a kingdom cause him to lose his character and the very essence of himself.  He even goes so far as marry Cersei Lannister for political means.<br /> The house of Lannister is a respected, feared, and hated house in the realm.  Their thirst for power has no bounds.  Their family can be found at various levels of power in the royal court and throughout the kingdom.  Their grasp of the realm has grown so bold that even the crown itself is indebted to them.<br /> The plot of this book follows multiple characters as the events unfold.  This allows us to understand the series of events from different points of view.  There are no defined protagonists or antagonists because each character forces you to empathize with them.  We can attribute this to the duality of man and perception itself.<br /> Though the story may be fantasy, the lessons learned in it hold a truth in every society.  The variety of characters presented represents all of humanity in deed and action.  The author seems to have done this to blur the lines of good and evil.  Inside of each of us there is a combination of Lannister, Stark, and Baratheon.  It is up to us which house we will embody during our own quest for power and success.a kingdom cause him to lose his character and the very essence of himself.

0061692042|2.0|John Irving. He defeated Richard Ford with these two sentences: 1) \\"Sorrow floats.\\" 2) \\"Keep passing open windows.\\"<br /><br />Richard Ford's entry was: \\"What I know is, you have a better chance in life -of surviving it- if you tolerate loss well; manage not to be a cynic through it all; to subordinate, as Ruskin implied, to keep proportion, to connect the unequal things into a whole that preserves the good, even if admittedly good is often not simple to find. We try. All of us. We try.\\"<br /><br />The book title implies a better shot at this develops from: 1) going to Canada, 2) becoming a naturalized citizen. Been there. Done that. And the plot seems to imply that, percentage-wise, Canada has fewer Narcissists. Sorry, not so in both cases.<br /><br />The plot also has 15 year old Dell Parsons worry about becoming sick and needing medical treatment. But - the town of Swift Current, Saskatchewan is precisely where the concept of universal health care was first put into practice on this continent, and P.M. Tommy Douglas soon developed a system across the entire province, at the time of this story's setting. Research helps.<br /><br />Although not a stickler for \\"political correctness\\" I was discomfited at times by Ford's portrayal of Jewish ethnicity. When Dell reaches Winnipeg he is enrolled in a Catholic school. There were enough Jews in Winnipeg for an alternate choice.<br /><br />As a dual citizen, who lived in Canada more than 30 years, I can find no justification for the title of this book - particularly as the main character ends up across from Detroit, living in Windsor, eh?
B004LWZW8S|2.0|If you've skipped the movie description entirely, here's a quick rundown of Immortals:<br /><br />King Hyperion, a bloodthirsty warlord, is on a quest to find the Epirus Bow, a mythical item that will allow one to \\"wage war on Heaven and Earth\\". He has set his sights on Tartarus, in order to free the imprisioned Titans and let them destroy the gods as punishment for them failing to save his family. Theseus, our young protagonist, holds a grudge against the king for killing his mother, and is thusly out for revenge. Along the way a ragtag group of heroes is formed, made up of Theseus, escaped slaves, and an Oracle who Hyperion seeks so he may find the location of the bow.<br /><br />I, as a lover of mythology, thought it was going to be a wonderful adventerous romp that at least, y'know, made sense. The title itself is decieving; it had very little to do with the Immortals themselves. Within the first several minutes I was already scratching my head for the film being vague, and a bit...jumpy. Part of my confusion may lay in the fact I was ranting aloud during the film at certain things (for example, why do all of the gods wear ridiculous headgear and dress like they're going to a disco rave?) but I couldn't help myself. The characters go from one location to the next with minimal or no visual travel, and the costumes, which in pieces like this are generally stunning, are lackluster. Espcially disappointing (along with the aforementioned gods' costumes) are the costumes of the Oracle and her three \\"sisters\\" when they are held captive. They are almost perfect, and a gorgeous shade of crimson to boot. But each outfit is topped up with a ridiculous lampshade looking...thing that absolutely ruins them. This is just my opinion, however, so it doesn't necessarily take away from the overall film.<br /><br />Another disappointing factor is the Minotaur, or what passes for it at least. When one imagines him, images of a massive, muscled, fearsome creature, part bull and part man come to mind. Here, he is simply a henchman of Hyperion clad in a barbed bull shaped helmet, who in my opinion makes a half assed attempt at killing Thesus before being struck down.<br /><br />The two redeeming moments of this film (and hence why it gets two stars) are the battle scene between the Titans and the Immortals, and the obvious eye candy that is the constantly shirtless Henry Cavill, who aside from being good looking is also a fantastic actor (one need only to watch any season of The Tudors to know this.)<br /><br />If you're still interested in seeing it, you'd be further ahead to rent it or watch it on Netflix rather than buy it, but keep your expectations low in doing so.man come to mind.

0375831002|5.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" is not an ordinary novel. Your narrator is in one person like a regular book except your narrator is Death. This one is. That is the main reason I found myself reading it. A book narrated by Death? I've got to read this.<br /><br />Set during the rise of WWII, Death narrates of a girl named Liesel who finds herself in a foster home with the Hubermanns after her mother. The story revolves around her life with them and the rise of Hitler along with her best friend, Rudy. There many ups and down for Liesel as she sees what a monster Hitler really is and how he actually affects her whole family life and the lives of her town. From her father's case with the Nazi Army to the persecution of the Jewish people and to the death of many souls from air bombs and the Holocaust, Death tells it all. You will find that Death is not like what you would expect.<br /><br />I honestly do not want to say any more for fear of spoiling it. But I will warn that you will want to have a box of tissues nearby and that this story will stick with you far after you're done reading and make you think of life in a different light. So, go read it!
B006LSZECO|2.0|After all the hype and glowing reviews, I recently purchased this book.  Unfortunately, I found it rather dull and far too predictable.  A romance - no, a mystery - no.  Guess I am looking for the unusual and this was rather trite for my taste.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! great to play while ur bored! great mind teased! keep the cobwebs away. good game if u like to think, some Ppl dont like to think. not good 4 slow ppl

B004XWMXW4|1.0|After listening to their version of Smooth Criminal by M. Jackson, I thought this cd could be an interesting concept. But it's really undoable listening to more than one track. I love cello, I like quite some of the original songs that they covered, but the combination is just plain wrong. Too fast, too brutal, too messy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was honestly one of the best books I've read in a long time. It has a unique storyline and quirky, wonderfully developed characters. It's one of those books that makes you think. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a funny, heart-wrenching, and beautifully written novel.
B009ME47H2|1.0|I feel like a trap . They give a free app, but all the features are locked and requires you to upgrade. I would give higher rating if they mentioned this in advance .
0671004107|5.0|Contact is one of those rarities where the book and the film of the book are of equal excellence.    The book works because the science is accurate, due to Carl Sagan being a physicist, astronomer and cosmologist and his underlying plot for the book... the interception of encoded transmissions from deep space being something that the scientific community was and is working on as embodied by SETI, the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence, which was located at the Paracebo Telescope on the island of Puerto Rico.    The concept is a simple one. That a non Earth-based intelligence would probably try to communicate with other developed intelligences in the galaxy by the use of radio telecommunications. Sagan uses the intercepted broadcasts of radio pulses which occur in the same sequence as prime numbers and it is this property that identifies the signals as non-random radio transmissions which draws the attention of the astronomers and causes them to investigate further.    Eventually, the investigating astronomers discover a television signal underlying the pulses and when they reconstruct it they find themselves looking at a the broadcast of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. The hypothesis is that the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin were the first TV transmissions which were broadcast around the world and that these had been recorded by another intelligence and re-broadcast to Earth. These TV pictures themselves had embedded within them the technical schematics for the building of a machine which would enable a human being to make a journey through space-time in order to gain knowledge of a more advanced civilization. I won't spoil the denouement.    Contact is a powerful book, because the detail is accurate and Sagan is stimulating our imaginations and yet staying within the realms of the actual and the 'doable'. The idea of traveling through a worm-hole, is, as yet, theoretical but according to Professor Stephen Hawkins, his theories do not break the Laws of Physics.Contact is a great work of science fiction and an uplifting one.[...]
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a great book, selected by my book club.  It is a very quick read!  I just couldn't put it down!
B0018Q4DTY|5.0|From start to finish, arguably their best album. Catchy songs, good beats and clever lyrics make this a sonic pleasure.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Waited till movie was available for home viewing and totally enjoyed The Hunger Games.  Suspense filled, human emotion, action movie. Not suitable for younger children 10 and under; contains violence, some language.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|If you haven't seen this movie, go ahead and rent it and be disappointed.<br /><br />The stories are just so disconnected.  Nothing makes sense and related to the whole movie as far as the stories go.  There is no action.  There is very little special effect.  Everybody plays very little part to the entire movie.  I feel like they chops up the whole movie and then stitches the pieces together in the wrong places.<br /><br />So, the movie is supposed to be about going to look for God; but this is not.<br /><br />It is like seeing a slightly better budgeted B-movie. So disappointed.<br /><br />2 stars.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Great vocals and guitar work!  She still has it.  Have loved her music since the early 70's and she is getting better with age.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Installed on my original Kindle Fire and it works great.  It is a very fun little time waster.  Perry and the other characters make it even better.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! Great story! It was exciting in many more ways than one! I'm glad I purchased all 3 because I'll definitely be reading them again!
B005LAIHR2|1.0|This movie did not advertise as just a musical.  It is...and a horrible one at that.  While the songs are good (from the 80's) the performances are just plain hokey.  Tom Cruise's role, which was probably hoping to be the lifesaver role, was just plain stupid.<br /><br />Save yourself the time and money.  This movie belongs UNDER a rock.
0385344333|1.0|I think this is easily the worst of the series, mostly because it's boring. You keep waiting for something to happen but it doesn't till almost the very end. The Reacher I'm used to would have sprung the lady from the car....easily. The plot was bland IMHO and, even when it was all said and done, the whole setup just didn't make sense. I just felt dissapointed for most all of the book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|If I was able to give ten stars I would.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl is simply the best, most intensely crafted nuclear mind screw of a book of all time. On so many levels the writing, characters, story is beyond brilliant.
B007TK77QE|3.0|Full of caricature rather than character with many reminiscences of Harry Potter characters it is an easy read but not a compelling one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is the best I love it it is really easy to build on and its way better than block story you cant even do anything on block story without collecting stuff it takes forever.  but mine craft is easy you dont have to collect anything
0374275637|3.0|It is good book, but I don't agree on outcome of irrational thinking. Herd and group mentality comes through irrational behavior. But irrational/group/emotional behavior creates and runs the economy and human evolution. If we were perfect in thinking we could not have existed or even created. Think it again.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I bought this book because Chris helped me out not too long ago. While in Afghanistan, as a Marine, I got blown up, had a guy killed 8 ft in front of me, my house on base was broken into 3 times, I came home to $200 in my account, I finally saved up enough to get a German Shepherd I wanted only to find out after I got it that it had parvo. After finding out that I would not be able to pay for it the vet started asking for donations and Chris Kyle picked up the majority of it allowing me to get my pup back. This is a great read about a class A guy. Read it and you will not be disappointed.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I like games with a 'theme ' or point to them and this fits the bill. I have enjoyed playing it - it is a very slow paced relatively easy game (not sure where others see a challenge as I have found it easy)  I have had trouble getting it to load on my kindle and it has force closed once which I find annoying. overall I will finish up the last level and probably send it to the cloud - a good faotd - would not pay full price for this, just not worth it.
B009UQCD0K|5.0|The last episode ended as Rick chops off Hershel's leg after he is bitten by a zombie. As they worked on him 5 living prisoners pop up and surprise the group. The prisoners thought they were a rescue team but soon realize that they are just civilians. There is a fierce standoff and the group puts Hershel onto a rolling cart and backs cautiously out of the cafeteria.<br /><br />The prisoners follow them and there is another confrontation and Rick and Darryl back them down. They try to negotiate a peaceful coexistence but it is difficult. The group and Rick have to decide which is worse, the violent prisoners or the flesh eating zombies....<br /><br />This episode is simply the best one of all of season 1, 2 and 3. The action and suspense is nonstop. If they can keep up this type of intensity then this season is destined to be spectacular. This TV show is directed, produced, acted, and written like a top class movie with a lot of action. I loved this episode and I recommend it to you.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was just as good as the first one. It is a great follow up story line.  Can't wait to read the final book..
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|We own about every game Playrix has developed and they are entertaining and fun to play. This game is a combination of a journey through the ancient world while finding hidden objects and touring the ancient lands of Rome, Greece, Troy, Phoenicia, Egypt, Babylon and Carthage. The game has very good graphics and sound effects. There are 54 levels to play and they will take you through the 7 different lands to explore.<br /><br />You get a history lesson on the ancient worlds and life during those times while you play the game.  The graphics are good and this game is challenging.  My family has been playing for over 2 years and it has become one of our top 5 games.  I can also recommend all of the Playrix games and we actually own them all and they are all enjoyable and fun to play.<br /><br />This is one of the three games based on the Atlantis series. They are all fun and I believe you will enjoy them all. I recommend them all to you!  Get this game now as you will love it!<br /><br />Edit:  The game does progressively get more difficult so save your power-ups, you will need them in the later levels.  My wife and I have finished the journey through all of the ancient lands and gone around the map many times. It is a great game.<br /><br />Size: This app is 368 KB in your app memory and 72.1 MB in your data storage area.<br /><br />Permissions:<br /><br />* Storage - modify/delete internal storage contents<br />* System Tools - Prevent Kindle from sleeping

B009GEEMLY|5.0|My wife and I absolutely loved this movie! But, what we really enjoyed was being able to rent it online and have it streamed to our TV. We rented the high-def version, and the picture was great. There were no buffering problems. Although it was a little bit more expensive to rent it from Amazon, I didn't have to make a trip to pickup or return any discs. That right there was worth the extra dollar.
0316228532|5.0|The Casual Vacancy is a very well written book. The breaks in the chapters are all lead into by the character mentioned in the previous section. Its a rather clever way to wright. It goes round in circles and makes the story very easy to read. The characters are complex and there are sublites to the story that you have to think on. The Casual Vacancy it may be but the book is anything but casual.<br /><br />As a warning this book is not for the faint of heart. its very hard to believe that the same woman who created Hagrid in Harry Potter can write a book with some of the vulgar parts that are in the Casual Vacancy. But as much as I might dislike some parts of it I must admit that this IS NOT HARRY POTTER! It is an adult novel and should be treated as such. Anyone who bought this book was forwarned that it was J.K. ROWLINGS first ADULT NOVEL.<br /><br />That being said it was a very book! Keep your children away from this one but as far as I can say there is no reason that this book should be discredited for its content. Its COMPLEX, COMPELING, AND INTERESTING. So to J.K. Rowling I comceded a job well done! Cant wait for your future novels!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app requires you to think to solve the puzzles. You can also do time trials and see how many puzzles you can solves in a certain amount of time. I definitely recommend this app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it because it is the best game ever and it has minecraft on the computer so that is cool
B00006FDCD|4.0|I love the movie! However in the end it looked like King started getting tired of writing and wanted to finish the book. The ending where they killed the monster failed horribly!
B007GE2H3G|5.0|The animation in this was outrageously fantastic- it left us wondering how soon digital imaging would successfully imitate reality, a somewhat disturbing question...<br />But, we loved this movie. It is too dark in a spot or too for young children, and probably difficult to follow as well, but for older children, teens and adults, a really fun, gripping, intense, interesting movie, looking forward to the next chapter.
B005LAJ212|4.0|I didn't immediately start watching Revenge until after I'd seen a couple of adverts. Intrigued, I went on to channel 4 On Demand and watched the first episode becoming instantly hooked. Unfortunately in the UK, we haven't finished the first season yet, but I had to post a review. Loving this.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />Emily Thorne/Amanda Clarke is outstanding. She's dedicated, driven and definitely not some fluffy girl waiting to be rescued. I am with this character every step of the way and most of that is down to Emily Van Camp's acting. In the blink of an eye, she changes character, from sweet Emily Thorne to angry Amanda Clarke. Love her totally.<br /><br />Nolan Ross: Amazing character, has some of the best lines in the show and I am just loving his connection to Emily. So shipping these two, but the writers keep thinking that we care about the overly handsome Jack and Daniel.<br /><br />Victoria Grayson: Oh so broken and calculating. Smother dearest comes to mind and Madeline Stowe does an outstanding job.<br /><br />Conrad Grayson: Delightfully vicious.<br /><br />Daniel Grayson: Interesting to see which way he is going to go. I actually don't mind the pairing with Emily, it works, just a shame that the writers can't seem to stop turning this into a total soap.<br /><br />Takeda: Although a bit character, he's still wonderful.<br /><br />Unfortunately there is some bad:<br /><br />Jack Porter: Dull and mildly stalkerish. I find it appalling that we're meant to root for a relationship between two people, who supposedly met for one summer when they were 10. I find it creepy that Jack remembers Amanda so much that he names a boat after her and dates someone who claims to be her. I know there are shippers for this pairing and I can't understand it. I think you're supposed to root for this 'good guy' but there is no chemistry between the two actors and Jack is as dull as soup. Hate the character and forced pairing, feels out of place and every time he's onthe screen, the pace vanishes.<br /><br />Charlotte Grayson: Her descent into drug addition is forced and feels unreal. Would have preferred a different story arc with her.<br /><br />Declan Porter: Fluctuates between reasonable and boring.
B000MDJH9A|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite gangster movies.  I love the fact that it was set in Jamaica and Miami.  Had me toned in right from the beginning.  I first saw this movie 5 years ago on bootleg and have searched for it every where, and once I found it here on Amazon I immediately purchased it and the cost was great!
B005HSG3VK|2.0|Cover for Kindle is great for protection. I gave it two stars for protection but... Quality gets two thumbs down. It is already fraying on the edges...sadly, I have only had it for 10 days max. Look for another cover. Paid too much for it to be coming apart already.
B008SOS63S|3.0|I'm giving 3 stars because the DVD and show are great, of which I also own. but the CD however seems to be flat in comparison.  So the great DVD averaged with the poor sound quality of the CD gives it only a 3 in my book.<br /><br />Overall very flat sound on a high quality home system.<br /><br />Quite a let down :(

B000022TSY|1.0|This self indulgent and self congratulatory piece of awfulness is a better movie than \\"Plan Nine from Outer Space\\", and pretty solidly worse than every other movie ever made.  The culture of the 60's sucked, and this flick is exhibit A.

B004ZRV3AU|1.0|Have cut 12 bottles of various shapes and sizes and not one was successful. It is very difficult for one person to manage the entire process as the cone that fits in the top constantly slips out.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|The movie was ok. It has some funny moments. While I like the majority of the actors in this movie, it just didn't seem to flow. The movie to choose when there are no other choices.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Got it for the weekend with the grands coming over and watched it 5 times!!!!!  We watched it like three times with the kids then 2 by ourselves, LOVED it!<br />Lots of action, humor, love. it's got it all, bring on the next one!
B000002GJS|5.0|Bryan Adams- \\"Waking Up The Neighbours\\" certainly does just that cranked up, it gets the party going with some great classics and brings back many memories and karaoke too... Amazon sure delivers a quality product on time, every time. Thanks so much... Scotty.
B006O6F932|5.0|I think it is a cool toy. People say it is flimsy but there is a hand hook that keeps it from falling and spider webs to keep the first floor up. I got this from amazon and I was surprised when I had to pay 90.00 for every thing. I sometimes  use it for a house instead of a high school. I wish they did the catacombs though in stead of the bathroom. I would NOT USE THE HANDLE THAT LONG! because my handle is about to fall off! In the cafeteria I put the disco ball in to make the dawn of the dance.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|i bought this neat little gear to try out the external DAC/AMP scenery. i currently have a decent soundcard with Asahi AK4396 DAC / JRC 4580 Op Amp for analogue output. people always say external DAC/AMP will always be better than internal soundcard. so there i was, gave it a shot. i must say the result was underwhelming. i guess if you already have a decent soundcard that has a decent DAC and AMP, this \\"portable\\" DAC/AMP might not be better than what you already have. note the keyword \\"portable\\". you might have to go up to some serious professional, or high end external DAC/AMP in order to feel the quality difference. on paper, the e17's DAC (WM8740) actually is pretty close to AK4396. the WM8740 edges out slightly in THD, while the AK4396 edges out slightly in SNR and Dynamic Range.<br /><br />after all this is only a portable DAC/AMP so i guess one shouldn't expect too much out of it. i was just expecting it to crush my current soundcard setup, but it didn't. in fact, it did slightly worse than my current home setup.<br /><br />sound quality:<br />i did an extensive 36 hour A/B comparison between the e17 and my current Asahi AK4396 DAC / JRC 4580 Op Amp (Soundcard). it's clear that the e17 while does the mid range and treble really well, on par with the AK4396 and JRC4580, its low end response is lacking a whole lot. and i mean a LOT. i had to use the e17's internal eq and boost the bass up by 6db in order to get the same punch. i am not a person for eq, since you're just listening to electronics at that point, this immediately is a BIG negative for me in my book. equipment should sound their best when you get them, one shouldn't have to eq in order for it to sound good IMO. the e17 ever so slightly edges out on treble. but if you already have a very good set of cans, extra treble might actually be too much. i am using it with a Sennheiser HD598 at home. other than that, there really isn't much to write home about. bottom line, the e17 is ever so slightly on the bright side, while the AK/JRC combo is ever so slightly warmer. the difference in warmness and brightness between the two become VERY VERY slight once you bump the bass up by 6db on e17, that you probably will have to really look for it in order to tell the difference.<br /><br />this portable DAC/AMP works really well for a laptop setup, consider laptop's internal DAC/AMP is always poor. it's an upgrade for my 2010 MBP setup with the ATH AD700. and by bumping the bass up 6db, it brings it almost equal to what i have at home with the Asahi AK4396 DAC / JRC 4580 Op Amp. i say \\"almost\\" because the home setup doesn't require any eq at all.<br /><br />i'll probably keep the e17, since i can use it in the office, or when i am not home.<br /><br />if all you have is a dinky creative soundcard, or onboard, this will definitely be an upgrade. otherwise, if you already have a decent soundcard setup, it might not be an upgrade at all for you, in some cases might be a downgrade.<br /><br />i definitely wouldn't think twice about buying the e17 if it's priced at $100, or $110, but at $139, it's a BIG maybe. hope this review helps those who're in the same boat. my next upgrade for the home setup will be the Asus Xonar Essence STX with the burrbrown DAC and PCM opamp. anyone care to chime in their experience, please feel free to let me know.bright side, while the AK/JRC combo is ever so slightly warmer. the difference in warmness and brightness between the two become VERY VERY slight once you bump the bass up by 6db on e17, that you probably will have to really look for it in order to tell the difference.<br /><br />this portable DAC/AMP works really well for a laptop setup, consider laptop's internal DAC/AMP is always poor. it's an upgrade for my 2010 MBP setup with the ATH AD700. and by bumping the bass up 6db, it brings it almost equal to what i have at home with the Asahi AK4396 DAC / JRC 4580 Op Amp. i say \\"almost\\" because the home setup doesn't require any eq at all.<br /><br />i'll probably keep the e17, since i can use it in the office, or when i am not home.<br /><br />if all you have is a dinky creative soundcard, or onboard, this will definitely be an upgrade. otherwise, if you already have a decent soundcard setup, it might not be an upgrade at all for you, in some cases might be a downgrade.<br /><br />i definitely wouldn't think twice about buying the e17 if it's priced at $100, or $110, but at $139, it's a BIG maybe. hope this review helps those who're in the same boat. my next upgrade for the home setup will be the Asus Xonar Essence STX with the burrbrown DAC and PCM opamp. anyone care to chime in their experience, please feel free to let me know.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app gives some really nice details on your devices battery life. Good breakdown based on potential usage. I would recommend to a friend.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I'll start with the characters. No character was remotely normal, with a small exception to our heroine. Why would the most important scientific investigation in history have a hot head geologist who simply throws a tantrum seeing a dead body from 2,000 years ago and run off? However, after essentially being deserted by the crew when a storm approaches, and seeing a true alien lifeform displaying cobra like behavior, he's not upset or scared...he pets it. Oh brother! Now, the movie itself. Alien was magnificent, scary, ground breaking, etc. This thing is just plain stupid. First it goes into all these philosophical and religious questions regarding the creation of life, faith, and evolution. However, there's no real answers, just generalizations a plenty. Second, these 'creators' are out to kill humanity? They are developing this 'substance' that turns into an alien race to do this? Why? Why kill us? Why go to all this trouble when they are obviously much more advanced? Why, why, why? Oh well, I could write all day, but you get the point.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I've always loved this game. And now having it on my Kindle Fire makes ke oove the game AND the company that developed it.<br /><br />Well done Playrix. Well done indeed.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Prometheus is not worth the $4 I paid for to see it on demand. However, I am glad not to have seen this on big screen which I would have paid more than I did. The movie was just confusing and difficult to understand where it was heading. I kept asking my friend what the deal was with the David's role in planting the alien baby inside Elizabeth. I did not also quite understand why the humanoid alien killed the old man who sent them to their quest. This movie will make your mind spin, not like how Inception made our minds spin in a very positive way, but more like a major headache after you sit through this two-hour-long movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't think I would like this book but was told if I could get past the first book then I would love the next two.  However, I did love the first one and I didn't hink it was over the top concerning the BDSM part of it.  I've read other books that were much more eroctic than this one that used the actual words.  It kind of got on my nerves when she kept saying down \\"there\\".  Puhleeze! All in all I enjoyed it and jumped right on the next two.  Now I'm like a lot of other readers looking for similar story lines because this one one has spoiled me. Another point I'd like to make is that I don't get where people are saying \\"Bared To You\\" by Sylvia Day is like plagerism.  To me, these books were as different as night and day and I enjoyed both authors.
0307951529|2.0|I wasn't impressed with this book and am surprised at how many excellent reviews it gets.  It had some helpful content and a some useful ideas, but for the most part it was advice you could easily find for free on the internet and much of it was a rehash of stuff you'd find in tons of other books already on the market.  A lot of the stories just sounded like good luck stories more than something people could easily reproduce for themselves and some of them sounded downright unbelieveable.  My biggest issue with the book though is some of the shady advice given.  The three things that bothered me the most:<br /><br />-The author shared a story of two people who didn't have startup money and couldn't get a bank loan, so they got a fake car loan for their startup.  Of course he had an endnote at the end of the chapter that it isn't recommended to do that, but that kind of thing shouldn't even be in the book as a suggestion.  He gave it as an idea in the chapter but then to cover his butt legally said he doesn't recommend it in the footnote.<br />-The author shared a story and the suggestion that you could sell something before you even have a product and then come up with the product after the fact and if people don't want to wait then you can just refund them their money.  The example he gave was someone who developed a written program/product and sold it and then once a few people bought it, he contacted them and (lied) said that he was developing a newer, improved program and if they were willing to wait a month or so then they would get the new program at no extra cost and if they didn't want to wait then they would get a refund.  I totally get the idea behind something like the kickstarter program, but at least in that instance people know they are funding an idea, but the suggestion in the book was totally different and totally shady.<br />-The author said you can create (fake) tiers for a product and charge different amounts for the same exact product.  This isn't as bad as the other two things I listed above, because really if someone is silly enough to pay more money for the exact same product in a shinier package then that's their foolishness, but it's still a pretty shady idea.<br /><br />Yep, I've used the term shady quite a few times in this review, but quite a bit of the book came across as if it was written by a stereotypical used-car salesman.  I'm sure with all the glowing reviews this book gets that the author must be a decent guy, but if there is an edit of his book in the future, he should seriously consider taking out some of his very shady advice because it made him and his book come across to me in totally the wrong way and once I read the fake car loan idea it was hard to take anything he said seriously after that.'t as bad as the other two things I listed above, because really if someone is silly enough to pay more money for the exact same product in a shinier package then that's their foolishness, but it's still a pretty shady idea.<br /><br />Yep, I've used the term shady quite a few times in this review, but quite a bit of the book came across as if it was written by a stereotypical used-car salesman.

B003Q7B78S|1.0|I was unable to watch the movie because the dvd didn't have the right region. I live in Norway. extremely irritating that the product I purchased and waited for to be shipped for over a month is worthless. Amazon should have sent me a dvd that I could have played in my region.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|I am grading this solely on the blu-ray quality since everyone and their dog has seen this movie and probably come to the conclusion that this is a horror classic if not the best horror movie of all time.<br /><br />The quality of of this blu-ray is great. They did a great job cleaning this up for blu-ray material. This blu-ray paired with my LG7600 Clearmotion technology made this movie look like it was filmed yesterday. This movie was not filmed in the best of conditions and the equipment and film was not very good, but you would never know it when you watch this on blu-ray. I was really impressed.<br /><br />Now I am 30 so I wasn't alive when this movie came out, but I do appreciate the greatness of the movie. If I had to pick my top two horror flicks I would pick Exorcist and Halloween (in no certain order). They just don't make movies like they use to. My generation just can't figure it out. I highly recommend this for any HD enthusiast, and especially Halloween fans.
0316212377|4.0|Anything with the 'culture' is a good read.  I did think it got a little slow towards the end, but certainly worth the time investment.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book becomes interesting when it starts solving some problems from a trauma lived by Christian and when he starts to comprehend that he needs to respect his partner´s wishes too.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|This wasn't one of those books that I ignored my family for a week because I couldn't put it down but I did enjoy reading it.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I also do not like having to re-do all the puzzles if not finished in the time aloted. Having said that, the games are challenging but not impossible. The match stick puzzle gave me the most problems so I just paused the game and googled the solution. Worked fine on my Kindle Fire.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Great read for anyone. Don't matter if what you read was presented in the past in one form or another, the point is it's all consolidated here and you don't have to hunt around for it on the internet, wondering which thread is truly correct.<br /><br />With the exception of the recommended reps, I agree with most of the information. I used to be a personal trainer and the reps I always recommended to people for strength and size was between 6-8 reps (if you were to pick and stick with a range), the happy medium. I thought 4-6 placed too much strain on joints, ligaments, and the risk of injury overall was much higher if your form was not correct, which is the case even among experienced lifters when they are in the moment, trying to push for that final rep.<br /><br />I recommend if you do go with the 4-6 reps have a working partner not necessarily for the spot, but for your form. Make sure he ensures your form is good THROUGHOUT all your reps. Everyone trained starts with good form, but the last rep or two they get brainwashed.

B0078XGJQQ|5.0|Attitude is everything and this book gives you specific things to do each day that will adjust how you feel.  You will see changes.
B00933JL0A|4.0|It's refreshing to find a fun game for my Kindle that doesn't require me to spend actual currency or recruit friends as the only way to get rare items. Of course there is the option to buy the full game but you don't need to buy it get everything (it just takes longer). The game play itself isn't earth shattering or super challenging, but it is a fun way to pass time. The goal is to build a town that produces enough food to feed to population of townies, give them luxuries so they don't strike and collect resources to build profitable businesses. It has an addictive quality about it, like Civilization on a micro level without conflict. The graphics are fun and cute. I have had the game crash once so I can see how that would annoy people.
B001N3UO7C|3.0|Good action with some unique elements.  See if you can spot Hercule Poirot and anticipate the fate of Steven Segal!!
B000I5SY5U|5.0|This is a great classic movie. The acting is superb. And it has reference to Nazi Germany, a meaningful allegory.
B004GBFF5Y|2.0|Any story whose premise is the would be suicide of a teenager is rather too cynical to be saved by dark humor. I'm not one to take things too seriously to see the humor in everyday life; in fact I consider doing so to be humans' best coping mechanism. But this movie falls prey like so many others these days to the urge to drastically overstate its thesis lest the slow-witted fail to grasp it. You can't start with miserable and strive for sardonic irony. You can start with sardonic irony and strive for humor, sure, but going waaaay too dark from the start makes it impossible to be lighthearted to the grown-ups out there. Think the difference between Little Miss Sunshine and One Flew Over Cuckoos Nest: this is trying for the former and nailing the latter but without the social commentary. No upside here.
0385344333|3.0|I love Jack Reacher novels, it's one of those things.<br />I have almost all of them, and I have enjoyed them.<br />I don't think this was one of the better ones.<br />I did not feel warm and fuzzy after reading it.<br />I am sorry fans of the novel.<br />It didn't do it for me this time.

0525953728|5.0|This is definitely a piece of American History being told as written by a man that was there on the ground.  We must respect this chosen few and try to understand how they accomplish the miraculous.  As an American, I am so proud to have these men on our side.

1402270275|5.0|i wasnt sure going into this book since I think its hard for some authors to really get the steampunk world but I really thought this author did a great job. Adding in virus's that result in deadly vampires after the % of the blood gets to infected, a girl with smarts in hiding, A man/infected in charge, a bounty, and who really is the vampire who is killing our main guys people: it left me satisfied. Not a knock out wonder but a very good story.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|While the idea is novel in this era--others come to mind in different era's: Pamela, Lady Chatterley's Love, Anna Karenina, to name a few, this writing is an abomination, repetitious and dismal.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|For a movie producer to make many movies about heros who have character to display that's something worthwhile for our youths to watch (within the context of a fun story) and then connect them all together within another story that includes all their character traits is, I think, genius. All the movies leading up to this final tale where they all contribute their own idiosyncracies for the good of all were fun along the way and certainly not disappointing in this final tale....AND...this final new twist of putting some candid shots at the end of the credits that either announces the next story or shows a candid shot of the group in their human form doing something they mentioned in the movie, is just another bit of creative genius....I loved it...it just keeps getting better and better. Iron Man is my favorite with Captain America as a close second....

B008IJHIAA|5.0|Thanks to the band and/or the powers that be at IRS Records for including the concert from Holland circa 1987 as the second (bonus) disc! As they did with the 25th anniversary reissues of both \\"Murmur\\" and \\"Reckoning,\\" I much prefer R.E.M.'s live tracks or concerts to unfinished or even bizarre studio outtakes. And as another reviewer noted, it would be great if they'd finalize the IRS-era reissues with an expanded edition of \\"Dead Letter Office\\" from 1986 too!

B008BM9L72|5.0|Intriguing story which makes you want to read on and on. It hasn't become a worldwide phenomenom by mistake. Awesome read - in fact I've read it twice already. Loved the characters - in all their complexity. Does require an open mind though. Christian and Ana could teach lots of couples a thing or two about being open and honest with each other.

B007WFR0QS|4.0|Actually, I had never heard of Emeli Sande until I heard just a few bars of one of her songs played on a reality TV Show called Basketball Wives.  The sound intriguied my interest enough to listen to a few samples from her CD here on Amazon and then decided to purchase it. While it's an acquired taste for her unique voice, the lyrics are meaningful and the songs have harmonius melodies which draw you in to listen closer. She is certain to be around for a while, as long as America gets to hear her music frequently on the radio. I'm a new fan myself.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This is one fast paced fun pinball game. I love it and play it while waiting in the doctor's office, in the airport, etc.  Only Angry Birds Space gets more play time on my tablet than this wonderful Pinball game!
B007PFDJH4|3.0|Ian McEwan is a great writer.  He is such a master of the language that he is a pleasure to read.  And this book had stories within stories that are very clever.  It reminded me a little of Le Carre's \\"A Perfect Spy\\" in that it centers on the real silliness of lots of espionage activities, but somehow Le Carre was better on this.  Perhaps because he knows the field better than McEwan.  I found McEwan's story just a little too cute, too pat, maybe a little silly.  If you're a diehard McEwan fan you'll like this book for the quality of the writing, which is as usual really very good.  But ultimately I found myself unsatisfied by this novel.

B0086700CM|4.0|when my boyfriend told me I would like this game I was very skeptically, usually I go for the rpg's or Sim games so I just figured I would try it because he suggested it. I was hooked instantly, the graphics are pretty good, I like fufilling the goals and the graphics are pretty grips. the reason for my 4 star rating is it does get a little glitchy from time to time especially when I have run more than 5,000m but overall a great game
B00846REIS|5.0|Okay so I read this hearing that it was like fifty.. all I have to say is that it is similiar in some few aspects but VERY different in many ways.<br />I would have to say that Yes I LIKED fifty but this one was MUCH better!! in SOOO many ways.<br />I love Gideon and his dirty mouth!! ohhhh sweetness! and how dominering he is..<br />Of course I wanted the book to be longer and answer the questions that I had but have to wait for book 2 to get most of them answered.<br />I wish I could just climb in the book and take her place when they go to the library! ohhh lord was that hotness!!! The steamyness is just off the charts!!!

0307361012|2.0|This book was written some time back and other Harry Hole books have followed on...that is the basis for my title about the evolution of Harry Hole.<br /><br />Although a huge fan of Harry Hole and Jo Nesbo, as an Aussie, this book was a disappointment.  The book was set in eastern Australia and the Sydney sections had failed to capture anything other than a standard stereotype of life in Sydney and surrounds.  The blokey cop, the Oxford Street gay scene the wise koori (aboriginal Australian) and Doyles being the best restaurant in Sydney (!!))<br /><br />Lots of inaccuracies about how things work In Sydney will annoy informed readers and long passages of koori dreamtime stories that could have been culled from any brochure...the connection with the story was marginal.  I skipped all these sections.<br /><br />I Because this book was written so long ago,  it is interesting to see both the evolution of the writing and the evolution of Harry's character.  Nonetheless the complexity of plotting and pacing that characterizes Nesbo's other Harry Hole books was missing and the book was a very average crime thriller.  Thank goodness the writer and character evolved!

B0098VYCCE|3.0|I didn't approach Snow White and the Huntsman with high expectations, and the movie did not disappoint. The visuals are interesting, and the previews provide a good impression of the dark atmosphere of the film. I think it really falls down in two areas: characters and plot. I didn't find any of the characters three dimensional enough to care about. It seemed like significant effort was put into making us understand the wicked queen, but I didn't find those efforts successful. The wicked queen's brother was a complete, disturbing mystery. The storyline was okay, and a lot happened during the film, but the plot meandered around without a whole lot of focus or intentionality. And at the end (no spoiler), there was an odd, dramatic pause that felt like it should mean something, but I have no idea what. Overall, an okay production that could have been better with more character development.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Nobody ever got it right, until Rick Riordan. Not the comic books that made them superheroes, not the TV shows, and certainly not Disney. Who knew that Riordan could launch a best-selling YA series based on the absolute truth: all the gods are jerks. Complete SOBs.<br /><br />Riordan's Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus books give us that old-time religion. Percy and his friends are demi-gods-children with one mortal and one divine parent. Since the Greek/Roman gods procreate prolifically, but aren't big on parenting, their children start off with abandonment issues. Add to this that the monsters of mythology don't stay dead-they \\"respawn\\" after a few years or centuries-and there's nothing they like more than tasty young demi-gods, and survival becomes a real issue for the god's neglected offspring. The answer is for demi-gods, when they reach a certain age, to go gather in Camp Half-Blood to be trained as heroes (by Charon, centaur-trainer of greats like Jason and Hercules, no less).<br /><br />We of the modern world would notice all these demi-humans and monsters running around killing each other, if it wasn't for the Mist-a divinely imposed mass hallucination that makes us forget, dismiss, or explain anything \\"out of the ordinary.\\" No need for Men in Black to come flashy-thing us and tell us it was the light of Venus reflecting off of swamp gas or whatever. So we don't see the \\"terrorist attacks\\" and natural disasters around us for what they are-the fallout of hero-monster battles and harbingers of the End of The World.<br /><br />Because the world is, in fact, doomed but for the victories and sacrifices of our main characters, Percy (son of Neptune), Annabeth (daughter of Athena), and so on. And wonderful-and terrifying, and sometimes heartbreaking-adventures they are too. And here is where Riordan shines; he takes the old myths of the Greek gods, demi-gods, and monsters, and updates them for a modern story, but he doesn't pretty them up in any way.<br /><br />So here we see the Zeus who is an arbitrary ruler (and a serial seducer at best) and his homicidally jealous wife Hera, who loves making life miserable and short for her husband's many children (forget what Disney said-it wasn't Hades who tried to kill Hercules as an infant). The other gods aren't a whole lot better, some are worse. With absentee-parents like these it's a wonder their children survive at all, and don't think Riordan wasn't making a pointed social comment here.<br /><br />The stories are wonderful, and Percy, Annabeth, and their companions are fighting for the highest stakes; they must save mankind-first from domination by the Titans, then from extermination by Gaea and her other monstrous children. But as you read the stories, you realize why, whether it is Absolute Truth or merely another mythology, the Judeo-Christian worldview was a Good Idea that eventually supplanted the old-time pagan religions. Today we can read about these old-time gods but we can't understand them unless we look at them through the eyes of their demi-god children, who \\"worship\\" them-in the sense that they make offerings to them and follow orders-but don't love them. The old-time gods of the Hellenes (Greeks) demanded respect-but did not inspire adoration.<br /><br />Why not? Because the Greeks saw the world as arbitrary and unfair, and their gods reflected it; after all, the gods ruled the world, so they were responsible for it. Thus Ares was a bully-he personified military strength, nothing else, and to the victor go the spoils. Aphrodite and her son Eros personified love-which could wreck marriages, destroy alliances, inspire murder, etc. Zeus and Neptune personified the sky (weather) and the sea (also weather), the two forces that brought the Greeks-farmers and sea-going merchants-prosperity or tragedy. If the gods smiled on you, you prospered, if they frowned, you failed, so you'd better worship them with offerings and rituals if you knew what was good for you. But evenif you did all that, and kept the few moral laws (mostly civic laws) that they considered important, there was no guarantee of the god's favor; fate was fickle, leading Solon, one of Athens' greatest historical figures to declare \\"Call no man happy who is not dead.\\"<br /><br />So for Percy and the gang, happiness is not guaranteed even if they win. The gods don't have their best interests at heart, and often obstruct their quests. Each book contains the potential for tragedy (heroes die), and therefor for great heroism as they struggle against sometimes hopeless odds. You know that they will win in the end, but you cringe at the cost.<br /><br />The Percy Jackson and The Heroes of Olympus books are written for the Young Adult market, and certainly Riordan gains strength as a storyteller as the series progresses, but I cannot recommend these books strongly enough.if you did all that, and kept the few moral laws (mostly civic laws) that they considered important, there was no guarantee of the god's favor; fate was fickle, leading Solon, one of Athens' greatest historical figures to declare \\"Call no man happy who is not dead.\\"<br /><br />So for Percy and the gang, happiness is not guaranteed even if they win.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have not finished reading this book, but so far I am loving it. I will be sorry when the saga is over.
B005LAII1C|5.0|After being beat down by Hollywood's recent (say, the last 15 years) interpretation of comedy, I was skeptical of this movie.<br />But, since it seemed different from your basic mindless, re-hash comedy(Epic Movie), or endless do-over (W. Farrell, J. Carey), thought I'd give it a chance.<br /><br />After watching Ted, I was actually happy to have taken the time to see it, and that doesn't happen often in this age of re-makes and sequels.<br />Being 49 years old, it's tough to come across a new, funny comedy. This is definitely one.<br />Admittedly, there are one, or two, scenes that even made me cringe.<br />This is NOT a movie for kids, or folks whose laces are tied a bit tight(as noted by a few bad reviews,... 'What did you expect, Teddy Ruxpin?').<br /><br />Most people will find this quite funny. 'Most'.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|Good CD... Tracks can stand by themselves.. However, it's starting to sound like a \\"Boston\\" CD. - I mean where the band has a sound and it's throughout the whole CD... Kiss' early stuff had a mix of everything... When I listen to this, the songs a good, but I think they all sound quite the same.... I do like the recipe they used for Sonic Boom... Lots of hooks and no filler!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Got this for the free app of the day, and its addicting. Well worth money, especially if you like this type of game.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|addictive. once you stop you can't stop playing. There's at least some sort of story line. It's  basically a matching game.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|yes this app is a swap 3 kind of game but it has different elements that set it apart from the others. There is an actual story line and the graphics are done very well. In all I am having fun with it. So worth it especially as the faotd!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a cool game! The graphics are real nice, especially on my Kindle Fire. I love the combination of several games in one app.
0316017930|5.0|Great book--inspiring. Easy and fast reading. Lots of great and eye-opening information. Although, there are people whose brains work on much higher frequencies. They can think much faster than an average person. For example, one of my classmates in college in my physical science class was a very bright girl who out-thought me in every case even though my math level was significantly higher than hers. We both were getting 100s or 98s on exams and I do believe that I knew way more than her and can calculate very complex things without a calculator, but she was still significantly faster than me. She did mention that she was home-schooled and that her dad is an actuarian, though, which makes sense why she was very sharp. But still, she didn't know Calc 2 and all that other complex and creative stuff  like poetry writing I know because I'm 35 and she's in her early twenties. Her brain was amazing. She finished all of exams in 10-15 minutes which took me 30-40 minutes. I don't know, perhaps she was familiar with the subject when she came to the class. Perhaps she already had lots of physics education before the class. This was my first true exposure to this very basic physics level because back in the school days, I kind of let it go through my ears, and only now in my 30s I took education seriously.
B007J2TMQ0|3.0|Fan though I am of Anthony Beevor this book left me cold...I think it would have been better for Mr. Beevor to have tried to either concentrate on campaigns,theatres of conflict or on the armies involved following each from start to finish...the chronological sequences did not work for me...an appendix with chronological dates would have done just as well...as it stands to me it was just another book about world war 2.... I appreciate it is difficult to cover such a vast subject and was pleased to see the pacific campaigns included but I couldn't get a sense of how things were unfolding....I would like to see a book about an enemy formation from the start of the war to the final end...this book to me was stolid, unimaginative and somewhat indigestible
B004J2TPSI|3.0|Well, it does what it's supposed to do, I can't say if it does it better than other similar products or not, because it's the only one I used.<br /><br />The effective transmission range is a little bit less than advertised (33 ft.) but walls will obstruct the transmission, so if you're planning to use it efficiently you'll have to be in the same room that it's in, but I have a Bluetooth USB dongle attached to a PC and an iPhone and they both have the same limitation, so I think it's a limitation of Bluetooth in general.<br /><br />The thing that's really annoying about it is the very low volume you get using this device, it's about 40% of what you get using a wired connection. Also the sound is a little out off synch when used to watch TV, but it's not noticeable unless you really want to.<br /><br />The quality is good but could be better, for example the on/off switch is too small to be used easily and it's placed on the bottom of the device near the 3.5 mm jack so you'll have to unplug it to switch it on or off. And for $50 I expected a more than this, like an AC charger instead of the USB one.<br /><br />On the good side, you can use it while charging it if you have a near by USB port, which means unlimited use.<br /><br />An important note about pairing, this device will only pair with stereo devices that have pairing code (0000)
B008QE9VJI|3.0|What happened to the story? I expected an update of the TV serial which was chock full of plot. Instead I saw a flic that was neither scary or funny but a watered down screenplay that bordered on the corny. I am a fan of the TV drama, Burton and Depp... and much of the cast. Was I disappointed? You bet! I did like the songs featured in the movie and I wondered why the closing song by the Killers, Go All the Way, was not included in the CD soundtrack??
B003YL4LYI|3.0|When I began the series I was in love, slowly but surely I am falling out of love with the books and the author. PLEASE come back to us MR. Martin. You're writing is amazing yet this book along with the last contained too many stories, too many characters, and too much oomph!!! I was not satisfied with this book it created a roller-coaster effect where I'm just ready to get off. Please let the next book tie up the loose ends created in this book and end on a better note.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The best part of the film is the credits. This is where you see who is responsible for the real creativity, and who is responsible for all the crap.<br /><br />The genius of the film lies with the more than a screen full of software engineers and digital artists, so one can speculate that each one of them was given a year and 1$ million to each create one minute of superlative special effects, and given today's technology, would be limited only by their imagination. You cannot fault the software engineers for creating the incredible special effects.<br /><br />In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if these special effects companies spend all their time creating special effects which they sell to people like Scott Ridley.<br /><br />So, we all remember the special effects, but we also remember the crap screenplay that still approves of smoking cigarettes by futuristic highly intelligent, highly evolved, trained astronauts who still appear to have a binge drinking ignorant and illiterate view of life better seen in your zombie/vampire movie. A line or two from one of the geologists - i luv rocks, i'm only 'ere for the money. Why doesn't Scott Ridley employ a writer who has the same talent as the computer programmers?<br /><br />So, what kind of screenplay were we treated to. I can't help thinking it had to be approved by people who believe in God and who have a rather puritanical and prudish view of sex;<br /><br />The central tenant of the film is somebody other than God created Man. The Hollywood film industry appears to have a problem with this, so it introduces all manner of distractions into the film such as making a big deal of each astronaut's personal egos and aspirations, and will this destroy faith, and of course we can't have that.<br /><br />For me, there was only one truly upsetting scene and that was the Caesarean operation performed by the patient, and which reminded of when Rambo stitches up his own shoulder using a needle and thread that he carries aroundwith him in the handle of his knife. Next it will be do it yourself heart transplant.
B001RMYWG8|4.0|i have seen this movie so many times i know it intimately it is pacino at his very best but there is a scene where he is handed money from another cop from a man named jewish max,BUT,they have voiced over the dialogue and changed it to JOYCE MAX,why!! will jewish people be offended? this is the name also given in the book,so why? i have seen an ugly trend in hollwood to erase anything not politically correct. remeber spielbergs new changes to E.T.? RADIOS FOR GUNS!!hollywood and their ilk must think mighty low of us unwashed heathen thinking we cant handle it!!!as if there were anything to handle! 4 STARS FOR THIS ACTION,
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I have a Focusrite Saffire that uses a firewire 400 cable, but my MacBook Pro only has a firewire 800 port. I have a firewire 400/800 cable that works, but the 800 port on MacBooks are bad for having a loose connection for a lot of firewire 800 plugs and the cable I'd been using would pop out once in a while.<br /><br />I bought this when I couldn't find the adapter recommended by Focusrite, and it works fine.  The 400 cable from my interface fits snugly in the adapter, and the 800 end of the adapter fits snugly in my MacBook Pro firewire 800 port. Previously I had a lot of problems with disconnects, but no more.<br /><br />The plug doesn't take up too much room from the other ports like some firewire adapters with way too big plugs.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This was a little slower paced than the usual Reacher novel but that was the only negative. I really liked all of the twists and the challenge of trying to figure it out. Kudos!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It's no secret that I'm a Percy Jackson groupie, so I was beyond excited for the Mark of Athena. This may be my favorite of any Percy Jackson book. I like that they are older, not only because they are having more adventures but also because the relationships grow and develop more (plus pre- and early-teen romances kind of creep me out, so it's nice that they are now about 16/17).<br /><br />Riordan is one of the few authors who can actually pull off telling several different stories at once. He does a great job in giiving each character enough time for the reader, without muddling up the plot. I like that his characters aren't perfect; they doubt themselves, recognize their flaws, and are relatable in the sense that they aren't perfect. They may all be demigods, but they are also just people trying to figure it all out.<br /><br />I hope to see more of Percy and Annabeth in the next book(s). I admit, I don't care that much about Jason and Piper since I'm all about the Greeks, but I suppose I'll tolerate them :). I'm glad Nico is back, and Leo always gave me a good chuckel (and I rarely laugh when reading). I also hope that Riordan recaps a bit more. I can't remember everything that happened in previous books but there are times when he alludes to important moments and I draw a complete blank.
B000V656X4|3.0|I loved this record when it first came out (yes, I had it on Vinyl).  I gave away my LPs a long time ago and haven't listened to it in probably 20 years. I purchased on a whim because it was inexpensive.  Sadly, I could not get through the entire album.  The sound is very dated, and the digital conversion loses some of the depth that I remember in the original.  The band members were all accomplished artists, and the music is crisp.  But it is also uninspired and formulaic.  I'll probably chose one or two tracks to add to a playlist.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|easy to play. fun that doesn't require too much thought. Good for all ages:  relaxing and entertaining for the whole family.
B00542UMIY|3.0|But a little thin for adults, leaning heavily on predictable gags, dilemmas, and character quirks.  It's a sharp stick in the eye to rich snotty women and the unpolished or corrupt lifestyles of some Mexicans.  Drew Barrymore does the best she can to pull off the bland stereotypes and absurd coincidences.  Don't expect much and you may be amused.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Could not even finish watching this movie. I knew it was going to have some things that I would find a tad bit nasty, but to make me close to being on the verge of throwing up!!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|The  story of Ender Wiggen is a captivating story that ensnares you, a must read that you can't put down!
B0037A4ILC|5.0|Great film with a perfect realization, making a real feeling of what happened in that sad temptative to Eiger north face.<br /><br />Perfection also is reached by the actors and actresses who make their characters so plenty of humanity, that no one who watches the film can avoid to feel courage, fear, love....<br /><br />And perfection is the result fr the specialists who had to enter in the same situations where the original alpinists where, giving so realistic images, that leave almost nothing to the imagination.<br /><br />My congratulations to the team, and its Director, that have turned a so good-for-learning situation in a film plenty of feelings and thriller.<br /><br />And, as alpinist, my deeper admiration for the men who fighted those days against one of the harder hell ever found in earth.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I picked up a copy of The Avengers on Bluray last Tuesday afternoon intent on watching it that evening even though I wasn't feeling well. I stopped at urgent care after work on the way home to have my cold and cough checked out. They told me I had bronchitis and prescribed antibiotics and an Ibuterol inhaler. I have never used an inhaler. Went home and took the antibiotics at 6pm, then the inhaler at 7pm. Sat down to watch the Avengers with the kids at 7pm. I had no side effects from the inhaler at that time.<br /><br />The Avengers was wickedly funny and I ended up laughing and then coughing a lot. I had a really bad coughing fit at the point in the movie where Loki starts monologueing at the Hulk and the Hulk grabs him and beats the ground with him like he was a rag doll. Great stuff.<br /><br />Then around 9pm I noticed a strange white washing effect in my left eye. I went into the kitchen to see if it was just from the dark room with the TV. The effect started to get worse and I called my wife in. I felt almost like I was going to pass out so I sat down on the floor. I started to sweat. My first reaction was that I was having a reaction to the inhaler. The white washing was getting worse. My wife was going to take me to urgent care, I tried to move across the floor on my hands and knees, got 5 feet and then sat back against the wall and told her to call 911. It felt like gravity had quadrupled.<br /><br />The ambulance arrived at 9:24. My left eye was still goofed up, getting worse. Right eye was 100% fine. I was still sweating, and was speaking with a slow, measured gate. Some initial assessments included holding my two arms out. In doing so, my right hand was dropping. These were signs of a stroke. I did not have any facial drooping. I was able to crawl out the front door to make it easier to get onto the stretcher.<br /><br />They took me to the Hospital in Grafton, a 30 minute ride. St. Joe's was closer, but I would only take someone there if I knew they were certain to die. By the midpoint of the ride, I could no longer lift my right hand and had a pretty good idea I was having a stroke. Alas, it does not seem that was meant to be. By the time we got to the hospital in Grafton, I had regained full use and strength of my right hand and my speech was back to normal. My left eye was still goofed up, with everything being all white-washy and sparkly like.<br /><br />Into the hospital, they did some assessments, ran a CT and X-ray and started an IV. Everything seemed better except for the eye, but that was improving. They had gotten hold of a neurologist and he ordered up a CT with contrast. During the scan, when the injector shot the contrast into my arm, the needle backed out of the vein and ended up filling my arm instead. It hurt like a SOB. Given the speed at which the technologist was able to figure that something had gone very wrong (sloth speed), I declined her offer to try again in my other arm, opting instead to wait until morning. I went back to the emergency waiting area (still on my stretcher) where my wife was waiting. It was just after midnight at this point, marking the official start of our 20th wedding anniversary. They put me up in a room for the night, freaked out of my mind.<br /><br />I got the contrast CT in the morning (Wednesday)around 11am and although it was of poor quality, it did show blockage in both my right and left carotids. I was still having some of the visual effects in my left eye. The initial prognosis was dissected carotids on both the left and right sides.  The doctors started me on heprin. I took a nap and when I woke around 1:40pm the eye issue had gone away.  Then decided to send me to St. Luke's as it is the premier hospital in Milwaukee for strokes and such. I arrived late afternoon (very nice ambulance ride) and was delivered to the Neuro ICU. I met with several doctors and the plan was to perform an angiogram in the AM on Thursday. The staff was friendly and courteous.<br /><br />Thursday morning they sent me for an MRI first and then for the Angio. The MRI was at 9am. There were some really cool protocols used, one of them sounded like sound effects from the old donkey kong game. The Angiogram went smooth without a hitch. It was a very nice Siemens scanner with a panel of displays that would make any NASA staffer drool.  Afterward, the doctor came by with my news. The MRI showed that I did not actually have a stroke (no dain bramage) but based on my symptoms, came ridiculously close. The Angio showed about 90% blockage on the left side and 50% on the right. It also showed that the blood flow was straight and smooth. They kept me in ICU for another day for observation.<br /><br />The course of treatment is now rat poison. I was transferred to a regular patient room, out of the ICU, on Friday evening. They started the warfarin at that time. The last few days have then been laying around waiting for results on the warfarin levels. For those that have not been through it, they give you the pill at night, then sneak in and steal some blood around 4am and let you know around 8am if you have to stay another day. I got the clearance to leave Tuesday morning at 11am (I ended up just a few hours shy of a full weeks stay). I will now be on the rat poison for the next month at which time I go back for a follow up scan. Depending on what they see, I could keep taking the rat poison or be able to stop it.<br /><br />The doctors indicated we will likely never know what caused this. Typically it is caused by blunt force trauma to the neck. There was nothing like that. The only thing I could figure is that it was from the forceful coughing I was doing.<br /><br />So, bottom lining it, based on the fact that it almost gave me a stroke and blew out both my carotids, I have no choice but to give The Avengers 5 stars.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|it is just like the online version...i love it there &amp; the app did not disappoint!  give it a try.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|great game. the only thing was why not charge the full amount up front instead of 1/2 way. its well worth 1.98. i feel the cost is cheap. its one of the best games i played in a long time. keep up thr good work
B0019EXZY4|5.0|This movie tells the story of the largest bank heist in history.<br /><br />The characters are English theives and con-men who work together refreshingly without any real treachery.  Instead of most American movies in the same vein, the group pulls off the heist, splits the loot equitably and depart friends.<br /><br />Thus we get to see this wonderful groud in action, each member doing a certain job fairly well.  Because much of this is based on a real story we get real stories of people and how people would act in certain situations.<br /><br />Intricate and intelligent with a believable happy ending.<br /><br />A great British bank heist movie.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|The colors, the music and the animation in \\"Rio\\" are extraordinary!  This is a coming-of-age story for the main character, Blu, who metaphorically and literally 'learns to fly.'  It is also a subtle, but instructive love story which depicts how letting someone go is sometimes the best expression of loving.  Like all Blue Sky movies, it is delightful to both adults and children.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Downloaded on my Kindle Fire to be able to view an AVI file that was unplayable with the standard viewer.  Downloaded it along with its recommended codecs, still unable to play.  A video player with codecs that can't play standard video formats isn't worth having.

But when researching on myDish.com learned I could find my favorite show here.<br /><br />Thanks for continuing to expand and carry so many series, shows and movies.  I am a fan of watching on catching up by watching on computer. And I am a great fan of Amazon.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Who does that?! Who says that?! Didn't see that coming!  Colorful characters.  No literary awards here but, Just the right mix of adult content and twist. Glad i picked it up.
B0012HRJEA|2.0|I was happy that the movie did stream well with no interuptions, however it did not have closed captions which was very disappointing. You have wheelchair ramps to your buildings, put closed captions on your movies.
0316228532|5.0|Amazing book!  Rowling captures the \\"real\\" world - the world of liberals & conservatives, bullies & victims, rich & poor, old & young - in her first adult novel \\"The Casual Vacancy\\".  Her characters are fully realized, flawed members of the human race with all their capacity for love & kindness as well as mean-spirited stupidity.  Rowling has successfully created the same kind of magic here that she brought to \\"Harry Potter\\": she has invented fictional people who become real to the reader.  These are characters to love, to hate, and to mourn.  This is a place to live in and know - the way we know our own home town - and the way we know Hogwarts.  A fantastic achievement!  I can't wait to share this book with my adult friends who've grown up with Harry Potter!  If you love this book as I do, you might also enjoy \\"Major Pettigrew's Last Stand\\", by Helen Simonson.[...]
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This app is pretty addictive. Definitely able to waste a lot of time playing. Free and fun. Worth the download, definitely.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Initially, I had no interest in reading 50 Shades due to the dominant/submissive story line. I had read about D/S while doing research for a book I have been writing about the culture of on-line dating, and the subject did not interest me. Eventually, I succumbed to the media hype and took the plunge.<br /><br />After reading the first in the trilogy, I wasn't sure if I hated it or loved it. But, immediately purchased the second, then the third. Honestly, I thoroughly enjoyed the series.<br /><br />To me, the book was about the evolution of a man, and I felt a deep sense of compassion for Christian. He is tormented by abuse endured as a child, while in the care of his biological mother, and then, as an impressionable adolescent, by a trusted family friend. He was unable to love a woman in the true sense of the word. Then, he met Ana, who loved him unconditionally, and they embarked on a remarkable journey. D/S, sex, trust, suspense, conflict, compassion, forgiveness, and love are all elements of the story.<br /><br />Recently, at a restaurant, I stopped to chat with a group of women who were dining at a table nearby. I began by introducing them to the mystery romance novel I had just published. The women were in their 40s/50s and one pointed to another saying, \\"She has read 50 Shades of Grey 7 times!\\" Everyone laughed and I turned to the woman and she said, \\"I'm looking for Christian.\\" I admitted to looking for him myself and having read the series twice.<br /><br />As evidenced by the popularity of the trilogy, 50 Shades has captured the heart and mind of many. It may be the only book of its kind that you will ever read.

B004A8ZWWO|1.0|10/14/12 review: Tower Heist is one of the worst films I ever saw! Boring story, with an implausible sequence involving a car (I won't spoil it for anyone). Much of the acting was amateurish and stilted. It seemed as if a bunch of friends got together one weekend to make a movie on the cheap, and everyone decided to sleep-walk through their roles. Even Eddie Murphy, who used to be one of the funniest people on the planet, could not save this turkey. I kept waiting for something funny to happen, all to no avail. I bought this DVD, used, for under $6 - $2.98 of which covered the shipping. Even at that low price, this film was still a huge waste of my time and money.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Loved season 2 and the show in general and season three promises to be just as good! No issues with viewing whatsoever and will watch it again I think.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|The Hulk made the movie.  Good script and great special effects without being Transformers Over-the-Top. Let's hope this is the last comic movie from Hollywood for a while.
B007SPPANM|1.0|All the hype for this film was a big joke. I remember watching this for the first time and wasn't impressed at all. There is only one likable character in this film and that's Victor Garber's character. I wish they had focused more on his character since he's the one that built the titanic, but no we have to endure three hours of crap from Jack and Rose.<br /><br />First of all that \\"love\\" story between the main two characters was stupid. Fall in love after two and a half days and she's already opening her legs in the back of a car. Ready to run off with Jack and doesn't know a damn thing about him besides he doesn't have a lot of money and he sketches. What does he like to eat Rose? What are his beliefs? Rose was a tease and a manipulative bitch throughout the whole film. How she just flaunted her being a big tramp in her fiance's face by putting the sketch of her nude in the safe along with a note. She knows Cal doesn't like Jack but Rose just flaunted Jack in his face. Just letting her fiance know that another man saw her naked that she's known for about two days. Cal should have thrown her ass overboard. Rose is no better than Cal she's spitting in his face, cheating, and giving people the finger, so classy.<br /><br />Jack is no better either, knows Rose is engaged but had no problem sexing her and damn near stalking the slut every chance he got. It's like he couldn't go one second without seeing her, following her on every part of the ship.<br /><br />I don't blame Cal at all for how he felt about those two twits. I would have tried shooting them too. Why would Cal waste his time trying to help Jack get on a boat, he slept with his fiance. Was Rose that damn naive to think Cal would extend an olive branch like that, Jack's right, \\"she's stupid.\\"<br /><br />All in all the film could have been great if they nixed the stupid love story and concentrated more on the history of the boat, the victims, and the survivors.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have had the PC version of this game for quite awhile and I absolutely love it! I was unaware it had been made into an app and would have gladly paid $5 for it had I known, but seeing it as the FAOTD...I am so geeked! Thank you, Amazon!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is a good one if you have the time and want to return to it through out the day. I do enjoy it to passthe time or on my break.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is very nice. It has a very pleasant soundtrack along with beautiful graphics. It also has great gameplay and a interesting storline to go along with the game. Worth downloading and trying while it's free. You won't regret it if you enjoy matching games like Bejewled.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Call of Atlantis is a HIGHLY POLISHED GAME. Works smoothly with NO Glitches on my Xoom Tablet.  It has Vibrant, colorful Graphics, Good Puzzles, Great Music and Sound effects, Nice Storyline and Engaging Challenges with much VARIETY.  The Controls work well. An Addictive Fun filled game.  Permissions are SAFE and so far, No Intrusive Annoyances.  I like it but wouldn't pay $5 for it.  Worth about $3 to me.  Definitely a 5 STAR app though.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this app helps me sleep at night and calms me down when I get upset or mad.I think this app deserves a 5<br />star rating to me.<br /><br />Nadia moon Williams<br />:)
0394826817|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book to my granddaughter when she came to visit recently.  She took it home with her.  She is not quite 2 years old, she followed along but not all the way thru.  Her Mommy and Daddy will read it to her more at home.  But it was illustrated and written well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I cannot wait for the next book... I could not put it down... where has this author been and why is he so unknown... his book was better than some of the best sellers that I read this summer...
B004XGN8W4|1.0|Firstly ignore the score and read what I have to say. I bought this product on Amazon because i wanted a console on-the-go. As far as doing that, it seems like it is an accomplishment. The screen does show a strong 720p image, and it keeps the Playstation 3 very secure in the Straps. You can use this for mobile gaming...the issue comes in when you try to use it for anything more than a quick fix on the go.<br /><br />Now lets get into it. I'm going to imediately point out my model was \\"defective\\" as the screen was suffering from water damage. I contacted support (their only support is by email) and they responded in roughly 20 hours by saying that some models suffered water damage during the natural disaster in japan. I wanted to get my money back as it was unusable, they told me send it back to amazon first, and if they wont take it to return to them second, and they have a return policy set up with Amazon. I did Amazon's exchange program for the first time and my second model came. This was a hassle and most people might quit here and say the product sucks but im fair. The second product came in and also had water damage, but to a much lesser more manageable degree. While the first had severe water damage mid-screen, the second model had minor water damage along the top of the screen edges in the form of bubbles lining the entire top portion of the screen. It only shows through white and grey screen making PSN games like Flower annoying and bothersome. The screen itself is crisp 720p but the viewing angles are very bad. You will need to adjust your chair a certain way, generally looking straight forward at the unit gives you the only working angle, where it doesnt end up too dark. PS ONE games can be unplayable unless you use the highest brightness and contrasst, the settings on this thing are really wacky and the screen itself (other than it's hd imagery) is low quality and they definately cut corners. There are ghosting issues and the screens very thin, pressingon at all it WILL cause physical pressure damage. It seems to hold everything sturdy and work well for gaming, scratches are either all over the screen boarder and unit or at a minimum its a gamble when you buy it. my first defective unit had scracthes all over the screen boarder, this one has none. All in all it works for portable gaming if thats all you want and are willing to go through multiple units if it does have water damage (it sounds like most do) good luck as it seems to be a crap shoot. If you are using this as your main gaming machine and are bothered by craftmanship defects such as screen bubbles, scratches, and difficult viewing angles, you will want to buy a regular TV. Since this product is fairly cheap i'll recommend it to those looking for a cheap way to play games while traveling and that's it. its a one star for anyone else, because of defects, poor lighting and viewing angles, and general cutting corners to keep the price low If they worked on making a better product and upped the price it would be better, but they didnt want to charge higher prices, so that's how it is unfortunately.<br /><br />having to keep a unit because i dont feel like jumping hoops that has minor water damage lining the screen, and fumbling with bad viewing angles isn't what i should have to do at all, so i cant recommend this product to most people... but as i said it does do what it is suppose to do other than that. its a 720p hdtv in a suitcase.<br /><br />I also wish they had a number for tech support, email only is bad, although they do respond and are helpful. I feel very limited here, so whatever they tell you in email, goes. your best way to get your money back is entirely through amazon so their tech support most likely wont be needed.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fairly easy, but a lot of fun with excellent graphics. I have enjoyed playing it, and appreciate that there are only a couple permissions.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I am a big Lee Child reader of the Jack Reacher books.  I would rate this book as a four on the first part ; a three on the middle and a four on the ending.  As usual when Reacher gets in a tight spot the bullets fly and the blood flows.  But, Lee does not get to grafic and that is good.  All and all it was a good read.<br /><br />I purchased this from Amazon for my Kindle.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love it this game. very addicting! works great on my Acer tablet. background art is good and music is cool. most have.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|it was a good movie. even my husband, who was not looking forward to watching it and usually falls alseep, stayed awake and watched it, he thought it was better then he expected and good.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When I first started reading this trio of books I never thought it would be possible to read 3 books supposeably all about sex. However, it becomes less about the kinky sex and more about the life of this man and what made him \\"fifty shades of grey\\". The kinky sex is interesting the first couple of times but then you'll find you'll skim over those parts and get to the \\"good\\" stuff, which is the story of this couple and the drama that surrounds them. I enjoyed the books very much and read them quite quickly.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|I was anxious to view a 3D movie at home and thought this would be a good title.  I also liked that you got a regular blu-ray movie in this package.  I really enjoyed the movie.  The 3D graphics were amazing!  I'm sure I will watch it again!  I waited a couple of weeks to buy and the price went down quite a bit.  All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Maybe a paid version of this game would be okay, but the ad-supported one drove me bonkers.  I think I had just played one game, enjoying customizing my cards and play options (to draw 3), but then my entire phone showed nothing but an online dating service ad and even the back button did not get rid of it.  I think I wound up exiting with the menu button.  Not sure how I got out, but I tell my 8 year old daughter never click on stuff like that so I wasn't about to break my own rule and/or tell her it's okay to click on a dating service ad.<br />Since she wasn't around, I played another hand, and sure enough another ad for the same service.  I could deal with a subtle, G-rated, easy to bypass ad, (or even an ad of the sort you find on the Kindle special offers version) every 10 hands or so, but I've already uninstalled this app.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Real fun hard to put down and it was free on amazon get it today. I would recommend it to any one wanting a fun Bejeweled like game
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this application. Very addictive. Disappointed though that once you complete all the puzzles that it does not move up to a new level or page of puzzles.
B00785P2QC|5.0|a real time game that is like simcity but add in the management of trash and delivery trucks. works great on the kindle fire. does run in real time so even when the game is closed ur city is still running. so be sure to set up ur tech stations to upkeep your trucks.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great application for the Kindle Fire. Seems as though it can be quite confusing but is actually easy to use once you work on it a bit. I love having the different versions of the Bible available to me as well as the ability to highlight, add bookmarks, etc. Great application!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game starts out like it is designed for a three year old.  Fortunately it gets better rather quickly.  It is a simple matching gem game but there are a few twists that make it a little more fun in my opinion.<br /><br />As a FAOTD this game is a welcome change from the intrusive data mining trash that has become the norm recently.  I do not believe I would value it at $4.99 though, the game is not long enough to warrant that price.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I'm enjoying it very much! I wish they would sometimes offer the full game free tho... but nothing is tor free anymore these days!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Having read many of Jody Picoult's books, I really enjoyed reading The Pact. The emotions all of the characters displayed were true to life. Makes you wonder how you would handle being the parent of the victim and/or the accused.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|All the other reviewers have probably said enough.  This is an amazing story that I feel like I just happened to come across while browsing on Amazon.  I read the reviews and even though I never heard of the author I figured there must be something here.  And I'm so glad I did.  I'm hooked.  I've already purchased book 6 and can't wait for the rest of the story, the movie, the soundtrack, etc.<br /><br />Very nicely done.
B004NSULHM|5.0|When i was reading some of the reviews on here, i was shocked to see so many negative comments. First off, this album is GENIUS, to say the least. The only thing i can really compare this to is the late 60s era Miles Davis Electric Music. Why? because Radiohead pushed the limits of music just as far as Miles did in that period, and honestly, this is the ONLY band i have heard do that since Miles. This is music for thinking people, people that simply dont want verse, chorus, verse, solo type music. This is for the VERY deep thinker. The band approaches this just like Miles, airy, repeditive rythem, and trance like structure. Yes, this is NOT ok computer..And im glad its not! Any band out there that moving forward will change over the years, if they are any band at all. Thats part of musical growth. King of Limbs will go down in history as one of the deepest Radiohead albums ever, in my opinion. This is waking people up to rethink what music is. You dont PLAY King Of Limbs, King of Limbs PLAYS YOU. Thank you Radiohead for bringing this to us
B009AJDDQU|1.0|I saw \\"Alien\\" on its release over thirty years ago, and was scared out of my socks.  No doubt there were some glaring holes in the story and some obvious issues with the science and technology on display, but it was an ultra-suspenseful gothic horror pic. With the exception of \\"Aliens\\", subsequesnt sequels seemed to follow a death spiral of silly ideas and poorly-developed characters.  I always figured that the lack of Ridley Scott's hand at the helm, and 20th Century Fox's \\"let's bamboozle the movie-going public with amazing special effects so's nobody notices we don't have much of a story to work with, and maybe we can still make a fast buck\\" ethic lead to the franchise's decline.<br /><br />Imagine my excitement at Mr. Scott's return with \\"Prometheus.\\"<br /><br />I missed the show at my local multiplex, so greedily anticipated the DVD release. What a let-down.<br /><br />I spotted too many holes in the story to even try to count'em; the primary characters, while purportedly scientists, act like junior high schoolers who'd spent the two year interstellar flight sniffing glue; none of the scientists and crew was even likeable or vaguely sympathetic, with the possible exception of the ship's captain, or maybe the damned robot (was he evil, or just following Weyland's orders?  Just what was his motivation, anyway?); there are few lines of dialog containing more than five words per sentence (I guess somebody in production figured, \\"why say 37 words when one will do?\\"); the gothic spookiness of the original \\"Alien\\" was sorely lacking yet again, as was any remote hint of suspense; the authors of the script mustn't know a damn thing (the dingbat biologist character says an increadibly stupid line about \\"...three hundred of 'DARWINISM'...\\": no biologist would say \\"Darwinism\\"-- that's for TV evangelists.<br /><br />But I pick at nits.<br /><br />All-in-all, this cinematic catastrophe, while at times spectacular, represents Hollywood's failure to \\"get\\" science fiction.  I thought this one might be high-concept, but it's no more high-concept than \\"Plan 9 form Outer Space.\\" If you put enough efx on screen, the studio hacks seem to think, the lumps in the multiplex seats will go, \\"OOOOOH, ain't that cool!\\"  I saw (by accident, mind you) 15 minutes of the latest \\"Transformers\\" picture, and I was hard-pressed to tell the difference between that one and \\"Prometheus\\": the look (production design), sound effects (including over-compressed booming noises that pummell us from time to time, sometimes just to remind us to be scared), cgi visual effects, action sequences, even costumes, were from the same mold.<br /><br />Paramount was able to save their \\"Star Trek\\" franchise three years ago with that reboot (it has problems, too, but dang, it's Star Trek, ain't it?).  Can 20th Century Fox learn a similar lesson before they release further \\"Alien\\"-ish drek?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great app to pas the time with. It is not so hard that you get frustrated and notbso easy that you get board. Beginner levels make the game intresting and fun for children and tjen as you progress there are harder and more chlanging levels for all ages.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I like this game, but sometimes it lags really bad. The lag starts when you get the amulet power-up and use it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is fairly good. The controls are a bit hard to master at first, but it gets easier. However there's no lava in the game. I can't find any animal other than sheep and it's always foggy. However it's helpful to me because I don't have the computor version and my brother is always on the x-box so I can't play.
B00943SP0G|4.0|Well it's a good movie it's a good start to the classic old series run on Hulu. Johnny Depp doesn't remind me of capt jack in this movie.
0345803493|5.0|This isn't the most erotic book I've ever read but the story line was wonderful! I enjoyed reading the first two books and now my husband is reading them...
B001223BLU|5.0|It's so nice to discover that I can get some of my favs so easily downloaded onto my new android phone.  And, cheap too.  Amazon makes it so convenient.
1401238580|5.0|There isn't much I need to say about this expect AMAZING!!!  The full size mask and packaging make a great display for my office.  The graphic novel is one of the best stories told next to Alan Moore's The Watchman.<br /><br />V for Victory on this Collector's set!!!!!
B0095R64AO|1.0|This movie seemed to drag on and on and on. A lot of the scenes were irrelevant to the story line. Very little humor, especially for Jason. There really was no \\"ups and downs\\" to the movie, but rather just a line of garbage. Very disappointed.
B005Z28M58|4.0|The best thing about \\"Desperate Housewives\\" final season is that it nicely bookends Season 1 by going back to its' roots and entangling ALL the women in the same mystery.<br /><br />With Gabby's abusive stepfather dead and the ladies banding together to keep the nasty secret, this season has a more cohesive feel to it. Fans of Marcia Cross/Bree will be delighted because she practically assumes lead status here as her character is the one who steps up to the plate when the majority of suspicion falls upon her. The writers take Bree as far away as possible from the demure Miss Manners stereotype she was in the beginning and Cross rises to the occasion wonderfully. She always was my favorite and doesn't disappoint here.<br /><br />Vanessa Williams' character Renee comes across more sympathetic this season as she's not used to generate friction among any of the characters like she was last year.<br /><br />This being the finale, the producers kill off several characters and not just peripheral ones like they did in the past. We also get some surprise and welcome returns from departed characters of seasons' past to help bring closure.<br /><br />A great end to one of the best series of the last decade. While it's not as good as Seasons 1 or 3, it's still miles better than the poor shows ABC is foisting on the public as replacements (the now-cancelled \\"GCB\\" and boring, overrated \\"Revenge\\").<br /><br />FOUR STARS.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|The movie played well on the computer, ipad and television.  We watched it as a family and my son invited a friend over and they watched it the second day.  Well worth the price.
0345803485|1.0|This is so, so bad. Even the grammar is bad. Don't read it. Seriously. You'll think you want to, just to see what all the fuss is about, but you're gonna want to resist that impulse, trust me. Try that old Anne Rice Sleeping Beauty trilogy, at least she had an editor at one point.<br /><br />P.S. To all the fanfiction writing, self-publishing authors out there--if your characters are American, then don't have them speak like British people. If you're British, and you want to avoid this problem, make your characters British for chrissake.
B00127RAJY|3.0|i've heard good things about this workout, but i have wrist problems and there are a ton of pushups in this workout, so i've only done the 1st part.  eventually, i'd like to do the entire 30 days.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|heard the hype and went for it any way.  it was worth the time and money.  fun and interesting story.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|there really isn't much to say about these, they are wonderful.  got this as a gift for my sister and she loves them too.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game has great music to set the mood,amazing sound and total involvement. Destined to become an all time great.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love this book, has wonderful characters and keeps you reading way after you should have started dinner! I will continue with this series.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved this book; the story was compelling and kept me wanting to go back to it.  The style of writing was superb.
B00914JWSW|4.0|I am slightly disappointed with this puchase but must admit that it's my own fault ...... I didn't read in advance what this collection was going to be.<br />The main reason I ordered it was that it included a version of \\"With One More Look At You\\" that didn't have \\"Watch Closely Now\\" attached. (I have wished one was available for many years now.)  However, this version just doesn't have the deep, heart-felt passion found on the soundtrack from \\"A Star Is Born.\\" That's where my disappointment lies.<br />Otherwise, this is a wonderful collection of Barbra's work. Most people will be thrilled with it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A very good for a free game. Most levels are too easy,  but the larger maps can be a challenge.
030758836X|2.0|Unfortunately someone in my book club picked this to read, otherwise I would have stopped reading after a few chapters.  This is a talented author who definitely has the ability to write, but that's as far as it goes for me.  It was unique having the story written in a narrative format by both of the lea  characters, Nick and Amy.<br /><br />My problem are as follows:<br /><br />It's hard to read a book in which all the characters are evil and unlikeable (Nick's mom had about the only redeeming qualities in the story)<br />Portrayed Midwesterners are dumb hicks who all live to cook and have a \\"thing\\" about tupperware<br />Likewise the New Yorkers and especially writers were all stereotyped - it made me think of something from the beatnik era<br />Take out the \\"F\\" word and the book would be 100 pages shorter<br />Take out all the crude words and sex scenes and the book would be cut in half<br />The ending made me sick to my stomach thinking about its ramifications (I won't give it away, but it's not a happy thought for the future).<br /><br />Basically I felt like many people wrote that I needed a shower to clean off the filth from reading this book. Yes, I don't normally read this kind of stuff and it just reminded me why I don't.  Just glad a friend lent me the book and I didn't pay to put this kind of filth in my mind!  This may be somebody's idea of a bestseller, just not mine.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Very disappointed after all of the hype.  Storyline has become amazingly slow and whiny.  Characters have lost edge and meaning.  Relationship is boring.
B002RI9PKO|3.0|This was interesting. As it always is when one looks for reasons beyond yourself for not being the no.1. The influence of pure unadultered chance was  disturbing and made me want to sit down and have a \\"bosberaad\\" with myself. The results of straight down hard work as illustrated hy the New York schools are encouraging though.a good entertaining read.captivating.
B000W9179M|4.0|The portuguese title is an homage to paulo although not his words. Paulo Coelho's stories make me proud and contented I have followed my dreams, and inspire me to reach for even more. This is a great book...don't recommend for your first Coelho read though. Try Warrior of the Light or The Alchecmist. Don't miss the epilogue of this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|great ap and great timewaster. now I can tell my mom that there are evil monkeys chasing me... five stars!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I admit I am obssesed with these books! I finished the mark of athena in two days! I really dont like the endings though because he always stops it at the most interesting part of the book and makes us wait a year for the next book. But i will be very sad when you stop the series! PERCY JACKSON RULES!
B0091QS88K|5.0|its a fun cooking game but you can only cook two things if u have the free version but.it wouldnbe worth it if you bought the free version
B003E8P9G0|5.0|The red pyramid is the best kind of book for teenagers who love the percy jackson series and areinterested in Egyptian mythology.Sadie is very funny,but can be rather annoying and oblivious at times. Carter is smart, but has no idea what sadie's life is like at times.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Teen Wolf is just the Best Series ever. It's fun and mysterious. Everyone should have a peak. ;)<br />I really enjoy it and also Colton Haynes is a nice man to look at. Get the DVD girls. It's worth it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|A typical fast moving Jack Reacher book. Action, action, intrigue and a different ending. I think after reading this book and other Jack Reacher books that if we put Jack and Rambo together they would conquer the world!
B003B02O14|4.0|I enjoyed this read. It was a typical John Grisham Novel with all of the twists and turns of a legal thriller.
B00846REIS|5.0|Right up there with 50 shades! and good to hear this author has so many other books to choose from!
B00003CX5P|5.0|this was the best right here they did me so ridht i like theys guys thangs guy for all thet you do to help us thanks and have a nice day your friend tommy rogge
0316228532|5.0|First of all, let me just say, not about Harry Potter = Boo!! But once I got over the hope that Harry would make an apperance in this book...:) I really enjoyed this book. The subject matter is definitely gritty at times, but very real. Too real. Definitely an adult book. But the way J.K. Rowling writes the characters is amazing. Even the characters you hate, are perfect. The story sucked me in right away, and the way it all is pulled together in the end is amazing. I especially loved how each character is tied to the others, through someone who knows someone, or someone's kid works for another character, or their kids are friends, and their stories cris cross back and forth at different paths, each character touching another's lives in different ways, whether for good or bad. Highly recommend this book as a great story, written by the best, but be ready for lots of swearing, descriptive drug use, and sexual situations.
0525953728|4.0|This book was great in starting from the beginning of a future SEAL and showing the life of the silent in a real scope. Great read.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|Peter here.  I'm a huge PT fan; have been for years.  In fact, I've spent an obscene amount of money on all things Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson.  He's the Pete Townshend of our time; and I don't say that lightly.  I was born in '65, the year of Help! and 'My Generation' and have been listening to great prog-rock since the age of 8.  But I digress.<br /><br />I had been lamenting the Tree's hiatus (I attended the Radio City show in 9/09).  While I eagerly await PT's comeback (2014, perhaps), SW and this band are more than worthy to hold me over.  These musicians are amazing!<br /><br />This blu-ray blew me away.  A huge shit-eating grin adorned my face as i watched:  it's so good!  I'm off to go watch it again!<br /><br />Regards.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|real fun game to play! Its nice to have a good playing game with a story behind it. controls are good with a great response time! I had the free app but it wasn't enough!! I wanted more! So I'm sooooo glad this is an FAOTD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Luv this game!!!!!!!!!!!! Def. 5 stars especially for free! thank u for making this an FAOTD!!!!!!!!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|If you have time to sit and play for a while, buy it.  You won't sit it down till you win.
B00571F26Y|4.0|The book contains solid advice about nutritional facts unknown to many Americans.  It is a worthwhile read, and I commend it to you.  There are still so many factors about our nutrition that are misunderstood.  This book reveals several more.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|The characters , you got to feel like you really got to know each one of them and you could feel the love between them like every family should be but which very few families really are. It is a long book and that was good with me because i didn't want it to end.
B001F0WXY0|1.0|I purchased this Kindle book because I wanted to re-read the book but also wanted to have the electronic version.  Huge mistake.  The book is horribly formatted and is almost impossible to read.  One font size results in words being dropped from the end of a page and the next size down results in last passage of a page also appearing on the next page.  It appears that there is not a way to get the text to appear correctly.  Fifteen pages into the book and I have given up trying to read this great work in the format.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Great product. I got one of these for my wife and I. We love them. we both had otter boxes before and got tired of how big they where. These provide great protection and are small enough to dock on our charger/speakers
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I like this game very much.  It keeps my interest and the music is soothing.  it is fun to play.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This is a Wonderful Book!!! I love, love it! I could harldy put it down. A must read for everyone. A very good price at Amazon.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is one of the best electronic caculators I own. I especially like the large display and the ease of tapping the keys. It is really handy when you need it to brainstorm numbers on your Kindle in the middle of the night.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was phenomenal. I loved hearing what REALLY happened and not everything that was presumed and proclaimed truth by the media. God bless these brave men and women.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love it... A great time killer. Almost too easy in the beginning, but makes you think as you get deeper into the game.
B00012FXAE|1.0|The movie I received was damaged and refused to play past 1 hour.  Tried to play it on a different device with same outcome. Waste of money.  Extremely dissatisfied.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|A good app to have to thoroughly monitor your battery, rather an itty bitty icon! Also lets you k.ow the runtime of other things like games, music, videos, and even web browsing!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Great movie. Excellent product. Good format and package. The presentation is prefect. Just good! Just good!Just good!Just good!Just good!Just good!Just good!
B002WV5A9G|4.0|The movie had terrific sound effects and visual effects. The actors: Captain Kirk played a great role, he was very<br />  covincing and supported the movie very well. Dr Spock played the actor as a boy very well. Also played the actor<br />  as a grown man in a good suported role , he was fatastic. Overall it was a great movie.
B004T0E2S8|2.0|Bought this for my tablet and it crashed every time I searched anything. Ended up getting a refund. Great app though when I bought it from play store.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The saga continues this book like the first of the series was very interesting one that makes the reader very anxious for the next book in the series.  If you enjoyed reading the first in the series you'll find this a good follow on.
B00932A2MC|4.0|A little far fetched, but a great sci-fi movie.  We really enjoyed it.  The effects were \\"out of this world\\"  The streaming quality was very good.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Jack Reacher is the character to follow, book by book.  This book is no exception.  Lee Child knows his character.  Child does not disappoint.  Enjoy
B007EDZ20O|5.0|Hitchens does a thorough analysis of Mother Theresa's operation and exposes it for what it really is:  a donation collecting operation that does little if anything for the sick and dying, while lending credibility to some of societies' worst characters. It is a must read for anyone willing to look behind the \\"oh so caring\\" facade of this organized religion.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I played The Lost City and enjoyed it quite a bit.  Thus was pretty entertaining az well.  However, az the others have said it is very short.  It seemed more like a preview than a full length game.  Could gave been better.  Still this company has the best games I've tried so far.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Should have know that if Ridley Scott was the producer, that this copy cat movie would be like all his Alien movies!  If you've seen all the original 'Alien' movies, then you don't need to waste your money on Prometheus!  It's story line and characters are identical to all his past movies!  Right down to the female survivor, the android robot who loses his head and still can talk and think like a human, and even the ending made absolutely no sense!  The \\"creature\\" gives birth to a baby \\"Alien\\" from the original movies, but the \\"creature\\" looks nothing like the baby that just popped out of it's stomach!! (Maybe this \\"creature\\" had an extra marital affair...who knows!) It was a total waste of time and money.  Paid $15.99 for it and if you want it for $5...let me know! There's two hours of my life that I'll never get back!!! Save your money and bypass Prometheus!!!
B005LAJ212|5.0|revenge is great i love it i couldn't wait to for season two.  you got have it. couldn't stop watching it my co-worker is watching now
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the plot, but not the author's repetition. But I do believe I read that this was the first book the author had written. Not bad for a first book. And I will definitely read the next two books and cannot wait for the movie.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Works well on sprint Samsung 4G touch! Great graphics and narration. A great time killer! Very enjoyable to play, nice slow pace.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have played this game, or something very similar, on my computer.  So glad to be able to play it on my kindle fire! I have not experienced any problems yet.
B007Z9QWVK|3.0|I was very excited to get this movie. What a disappointment, too much jumping from one time period to the other. It would have been great<br />  to just tell the story about the Duke and Duchess of Windsor!!!!!!!!!
B005LAIHY0|3.0|If this is meant to be a reboot of the \\"Alien\\" franchise, it leaves something to be desired.  It is great visually, but none of the characters are worth getting emotionally invested in.  Hopefully this is just a bridge movie to tie together the previous ones to a new plot storyline yet to come.  If so, please get us a character we can actually care about!  Still, its better than the \\"Alien vs Predator\\" abominations.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I saw the movie at least 4 times in the theatres and I still can't get enough of it. I'm glad I own the movie.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Everytime I get on it, it won't respond then I close out and get back on and it's working again..
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book is one of those milestone books that you should never miss. As expected from mitch albom, this book cant be put down after you started reading it. When you get to last page you have resolution and satisfaction, yet you hunger for more. Will certainly read again from time to time...great insights and thoughts
B001DCZ4IW|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There was nothing funning about it. A complete waste of time...
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|had this on my pc and now on my kindle fire.  works beautifully.  very rich graphics.  cant believe its free.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Very well played! Fantastic charicters and cinamatography! I expected it to be great and it was even better! Appreciate that they are always changing things up and keeping us guessing while staying true to our charicters.  Performances were note worthy
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool.  Excellent series.  These are the kinds of stories that big publishers have been smothering for decades.  Doesn't compromise.  Balanced and engaging.  For me, personally, it's inspiring.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Para los amantes del cine, una de las colecciones que debemos tener y si es mejor en calidad Blu Ray!!!
B0044WSGXI|3.0|I guess movie was OK.  Could not hear half the dialogue.  Amazon needs to get real and supply subtitles or captions. I am a PRIME customer.  Contacted Amazon. They don't do captions or subtitles (except foreign language) for any of their movie downloads.  I will have to get the movie from Netflix to have captions, I guess.  Too bad, Amazon. I won't be getting any more movie downloads from you until you change this ridiculous policy!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I'm not giving 5 stars because I reserve that rating for games that border on perfection. I give it 4 stars because I like almost everything about it. The graphics are smooth, well animated, and colorful. The gameplay is as responsive as it needs to be, but lacks the wow factor of a pop cap game. The music is catchy, but repetitive. The story (gratuitous for a puzzler) is just interesting enough to get you involved. Overall, a solid good app. Thanks for the freebie.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|I love seeing all of my old comic book heroes come to life on the big screen although some have been quite the tongue in cheek almost boring, like FF4, and could've been done much better.  I'm one who watches movies strictly for their entertainment value, not tear 'em apart based on story, actor's performances, etc.  And I found Avengers quite entertaining and a movie the whole family can watch together.  I look forward to additional episodes of Avengers and others.  I liked it.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie has been getting ripped apart by people with their hopes just way too high. I feel this is a prequel film to the Alien series yes but come on people your just being way too judgmental. Anyway that's what I wanted to say off the bat this movie is fantastic great cast very good storyline (yes it's not perfect but and it has it's plot holes) but it fits the Alien theme well and has great potential to relaunch the series which was kinda faltering on it's own anyway. Any real sci-fi fan should check this movie out it's worth it!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I am still reading this first book for adults by J. K. Rowling but totally absorbed in the characters she has painted with glorious color, humor, flaws, jealousy and survival.  It's a story about years of the rich dominating the poor,  as well as about detached parents and angry kids. I have not arrived at the resolution of all the issues brewing, but strongly feel that I will be delighted at the end of the book.
B007I1Q4W2|2.0|Some movies are good when they move slowly, Suspense,Drama,Romance,etc. But some movies genre's should NEVER move slowly Horror,Action,Thriller, and THIS DANG MOVIE!<br /><br />This is a post Civil War involving zombies (with cheap makeup) and a main plot that in any other movie would be a minor 10minute sub story. Think about The Book Of Eli. Imagine if instead the movie wasn't about a man on a quest to deliver a book but instead it stopped 20 minutes into his journey after he came across the first gang of bandits, and that became the entire movie. That is what Exit Humanity is. It's a long drawn on movie with an uninteresting plot that doesn't carry much suspense. The acting is good for this type of low budget film, and the animated selections add an interesting touch. However what's out of place is the Narration POV story format that gets old quickly and the idea that there's never a moment when you feel like the characters have a reason to run for their lives or be in fear like most Zombie movies.<br /><br />This probably would have been a better Post Civil War movie than a Zombie movie. It would be better if there were no Zombies and instead it was about a Soldier who came home and found his family murdered by bandits and go on a hunt to find them for revenge, then find out in the end the bandits are a group of soldiers who have been tainted by what they've experienced in war and can't seem to forget the battle field so they kill,rape, and rob people. Then the movie is about the former soldier hunting down these men and making them pay for what they did and in the final scene he has a stand off with the former General who commanded the group of bandits and for a twist let it not be just that he had a simple group of bandits, but they were just a few soldiers from the army he was rebuilding to raise war again only this time to attack the WEST. See that sounds like a better movie already.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I don't normally play this type game, but this is hard to put down.<br />this will make me late for work.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|In spite of an initial error message saying it won't work on my phone after installation, this is a fun little time-killer.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|really like this type of game. good graphics and colorful. wish there were more faotd like this. kudos to the developer.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This entertained us all weekend! I thought and dreamt about the characters!  Jessica Lange is amazing!  Really creepy and really real! Just such a wonderfully inventive take on a ghost story and creepiness!  The house is gorgeous and scary looking and so believably haunted looking!  The Tiffany glass is amazing! This is a treat for the eyes.  A scary, believable, amazingly imaginative story!!!!! Love it! Love the incredible depth of the characters!!!!! Comparable to True Love in a whole different way!!!!!! Exceptionally well-done!!!!!!!!!!!! All of the actors are amazing!!!!! Bravo! You deserve all of the Emmy awards!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have issues with insomnia caused by a mind that can never truly quiet down by itself. Audiobooks have worked for years but now I'm letting the stories take up my concentration. I'll lay there awake, listening to the book the whole night. This silences my mind and relaxes me so much. It' wonderful! Being in highschool, the sleep this app lets me get is a GODSEND.
B0098VXE50|5.0|this is a great movie great actors great plot action from beginning toend I think everyone should watch it at least once I watched it twice in one week
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The kids really enjoyed playing it and since I've tried it, it's kinda catchy. Yes, it's a fun little game requiring very little thought, mostly eye hand coordination.
B001BANK32|5.0|Great character development here with psychological pain and family ties. King really gets in the mind of his victims and the terror feels real. I recommend this to any horror fan
B008OOYALE|4.0|The kid loves dragons and so he loves this game.  It's a cute game and can teach kids patience because you have to wait, sometimes hours, to see what happens.  I do wish however there was a better way to get gold besides paying rreal money for it.  And they should make it where you can interact more with the dragons.  Overall, a good game.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Babel seems to lack some of the energy of the first album but still brings the unique style and emotional immediacy.
B004EPZ03O|1.0|Disneys first flop was a movie called Tex, the first movie I walked out of the theater on. Then came George of the jungle, both of them, and Underdog.  Now it sounds like they are making another flop with the Lone Ranger.<br />All this movie did was make a sick fun of the other muppet movies.  They had to put the rainbow song in it to have at least one good song in the whole movie. I wish they didn't put so much importence on the movie if miss piggy wasn't there. I wish they would do a good muppet movie without that character in it at all.  What Disney should have done, besides get a better writter, was make a Muppet Adventure and forget this thing about the gang braking up.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|If you're like me you have probably dreamed of meeting the public person who most inspires your life many times. Maybe it will happen for you as it happens for some fans backstage on Part of Me.<br /><br />The next best thing would  be going to the concert and hoping that one day, maybe.. you could be one of the lucky few who make it all the way backstage and meet your inspiration, or would you meet them randomly somewhere? It happens.<br /><br />Here then is a rare opportunity to do something similar, experience Katy Perry in concert, get a backstage pass and a fly on the wall behind the scenes look at the California Dreams tour.<br /><br />I will be the first to admit that I am not Katy Perry's number one fan. I don't own any of her albums, but I do respect her accomplishments, her mighty alabaster orbs, her charisma and presence and the fact that she did manage to get five number ones singles off her Teenage Dreams album.<br /><br />In so doing she matched an accomplishment only ever achieved by Michael Jackson for Bad.<br /><br />Her number one Billboard singles were: Last Friday Night (TGIF), California Gurls (featuring Snoop Dogg), the anthemic Firework, E.T (featuring Kanye West) and Teenage Dream.<br /><br />As a writer I loved her use her use of alliteration on songs such as Hummingbird Heartbeat, and cherry chapstick on I Kissed a Girl.<br /><br />Part of me is combination biography, concert tour, real life drama. I loved watching the performances and I think she is a tremendous songwriter with one of the best voices in the business.<br /><br />The bio part shows that overnight success only came after years of hard work, struggle and rejection. It's an inspiring story about persisting against the odds.<br /><br />Although she was going through some tough personal stuff in her life during this tour particularly with the end of the marriage with Russell Brand I found this gave an emotional wallop to the movie. At one point before the concert in Rio she sobs uncontrollably in her dressing room. Her staff wonders if she can perform at all.<br /><br />Then she calls for her makeup artist. On her way to the stage she breaks down again her body racked with sobs. Then she gets on the elevator to the stage, she turns on her lollipops and we see a change in her facial expression as her game face comes on. It's a wonder to behold. What a trouper.<br /><br />Then the fans sing 'we love you Katy' in Portuguese almost as if they sense her struggle and lift her up. These were some of the greatest moments I will experience at any movie this year. The concert scenes I found to be visually spectacular down to the smallest detail with vibrant colors and a dizzying array of colorful costumes that dutifully and beautifully highlight her voluptuous figure.<br /><br />I commend her for letting us get so close and sharing something so deeply personal even though she was hurting at the time. In so doing she has fashioned a remarkable movie.<br /><br />I loved this movie and highly recommend it even if you are not a huge fan but just love great performance and I hope you found this helpful.uncontrollably in her dressing room.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|Excellent functionality and value. Fits snugly but easy to put on. Not slick nor is it sticky, handles nicely. Provides great protection. Can't beat the price.
0316743003|4.0|Very happy I read this book. Great inside info on  the U2, SR71 and F177A stealth planes and how they were developed, funded and used.  After listening to Ben Rich's comments I wish we had more organizations use these small independent research divisions in their arsenal.  Let's hope they continue to provide the technological edge we may need in the future.  A good read and well worth the money.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Having returned reciently from England I find this look into West Country English life very interesting.  The Characters play very well and the insights into young minds facinating. Unfortuniately, the portrail of adolicent morals is all too close to the mark.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This is a fascinating look at the influence of classical cultural documents on the early renaissance. It focuses on the scholarly research of Poggio Braccolini,whose love of classical literature led him to a discovery of one of the most important poems of the ancient era, On the Nature Of Things by Lucretius.He and others of his time faced profound internal struggles between the values of classical humanism they were reading in these texts and their Catholicism. They were influenced by the approaches of Epicurus and Lucretius, men of the ancient world, they had discovered, who accepted atheism and who had a world view that was remarkable as a precursor to a  modern scientific ethos.<br />These men, including Poggio, who rose from the ranks to become the Pope's secretary were often in the Papal inner circle, where such philosophies were extremely dangerous. Swerve is an insider's expose of the political and social intrigues of the Papal environment, which  makes present day corruption seem sanitized and tame. In addition, it ties the intrigues of the early renaissance Papacy to how these ideas of the ancients survived suppression to influence the emergence of the modern world because of the scholasticism and reverence of these men.

B007TK77QE|2.0|I am finding it difficult to finish this book chiefly because I consider it to be young adult/teenage material. It is slow moving and does not for me have adult appeal.

0316228532|4.0|I will attempt to leave no spoilers. I hate reading reviews with spoilers.<br />I loved this novel. It is not my normal fare, I am usually a fantasy/science fiction connoisseur. Rowling, however, made me absolutely love to hate Pagford and most of its inhabitants with this one. I cannot stress enough, this is NOT a child appropriate novel. I would think it was marketed well enough as an adult novel, but it seems some people are letting their children read it thinking it's for them. The best word I can think of for this novel is gritty. It is real life, showing all the hard knocks a person or family may deal with from drugs to sex to death. It's the intricate, complicated relationships of families with abusers of everything from drugs to people, and how the families interact with one another. To me, it was the epitome of everything lovable and despicable about small town living, and the grim reality of the sad underbelly of society of which everyone wants to wash their hands and deny knowledge.<br />Her characters are realistic, believable characters. The story is engaging and honest, a real look at life in the small town of Pagford and the outlying communities from a number of different perspectives.<br />If you are expecting to read something like Harry Potter, don't read this. It's well written, believable and a good read; but it is nothing like the Harry Potter novels. If you liked The Thirteenth Tale, or something similar, then this is a novel for you.

B0085KGHI6|5.0|During the mid 1980's I worked at The Blues Harbor in the Buckhead section of Atlanta. I had the opportunity to see many graet Blues artists; Matt Murphy and \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown, just to name a couple. I also visited Chicago a couple of times and heard some of the best live performances of my lifetime.<br />If you have never been to a live Blues show, or if you want to remember what an incredible experience it is to be there, I think this is the best representation you'll find.<br />And besides, it's the great Muddy Waters and the Rolling f*%$ing Stones!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|OK this is not the cerebral review so many other write. I will just say that this film was intensely great. It delivered incredible visuals. It gave a foundation for the Alien movies. It also created a lot more questions than it answered which for some is a huge drawback. I for one hope to see more in this story line as I hate for the story to end. What's next? I am sure it will be incredible. Ridley Scott certainly has not lost his touch after all these years.<br />SK

0316228532|4.0|Imagine for a moment that you are J.K. Rowling. Your internationally bestselling novels about an orphan boy who attends an imaginary school for wizards and witches, over which you labored for 10 years, have sold hundreds of millions of copies. They have been translated into 73 languages and turned into eight blockbuster movies. Harry Potter is now and probably will remain a household name for decades. You are reportedly the richest woman in England (even richer than your queen), quite possibly the world. You are A-listed for every conceivable event on the planet. Would you rest on your laurels, perhaps buy a private jet and a yacht or two, and tour the world?<br /><br />Suppose instead that your life consists of an occasional commencement address and the rare television interview, but you would rather retain your privacy and work with disadvantaged children that harken back to your own humble beginnings. And your creative mind continues to nudge you that you still have stories to tell.<br /><br />This is how Rowling's eagerly awaited new novel, THE CASUAL VACANCY, came about. By virtue of her fame, over one million copies were pre-sold before the book hit the stores. Readers expecting the charm and magic of Harry Potter are in for a surprise. This serious, often dark and sometimes humorous novel is a tale of the inhabitants of the small, west England village of Pagford, similar to the one where Rowling grew up. She has brought them to life through a half-dozen middle-class families who share career, political and social ambitions. Their children attend the same schools; several are teenagers who live in their own worlds of cell phones, laptops and social networking. Between Pagford and a nearby medium-sized city that provides industry and commerce to the region lies a crumbling housing project known as The Fields. The Fields are rife with the problems attendant to poverty --- drugs, prostitution, alcoholism, unemployment, hopelessness --- and an especially poignantfamily, the Weedons.<br /><br />Pagford's governing council is led by its most popular and beloved councilman, Barry Fairbrother. Barry's unexpected death at age 42 brings about a rift in the community as selection begins to elect his replacement. The council was about to vote on the continuation of a controversial methadone clinic in The Fields, a project that Barry had strongly supported. This event becomes a tragic catalyst for destruction. Relationships between married couples, parents and their teenage children, and long-term friendships become frayed as the ghost of Barry Fairbrother seems to hover over the conscience of the village.<br /><br />There are no magic potions or wands in Pagford to mitigate the problems that lay just below the surface of the idyllic little village. The all-too-human inhabitants of Pagford are left to fend for themselves, as must we all. Rowling has turned her storytelling mastery to a subject that has made the book controversial in England. It is a story of the clash between classes and is very British in its view of the haves versus the have-nots. The humor, dialect and vocabulary are often colloquial, so if you are unfamiliar with British slang and phrases, you may be nonplussed on occasion. For instance, if one is not familiar with the difference between \\"public\\" and \\"private\\" schools in the UK --- the exact opposite of the American education system --- it can be confusing. Also, reference to \\"living on the estate\\" in England means that you live in publicly financed housing. Going home to the estate is not driving through the gates to your mansion containing rare works of art, a pool and tennis courts in Beverly Hills. It is far more likely to be a tenement whose art is defined by graffiti.<br /><br />Class consciousness is a popular theme of novels, even in America's coveted ideal of democracy. THE STARBOARD SEA, the acclaimed first novel by Amber McDermont, takes place in a similar American eastern small town. It is a story ofclass warfare between the privileged students of an exclusive boarding school and the \\"townies.\\" Much like CATCHER IN THE RYE of an earlier era, these and books like them define the ever-present pecking order of the human condition. Will A CASUAL VACANCY by an author of the stature of J.K. Rowling compare? Only time will tell.<br /><br />Reviewed by Roz Shea

B008JGSM6G|4.0|I have enjoyed it and my 7 year old really likes it. It polrogressively gets harder which allowed her to get adjusted to the concept.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I was so looking forward to this movie. This is a pretty movie that piggy back's on Alien and X-Files but without the action or tension. In addition, great actors were wasted since they really had relatively little screen time and even those seemed to somehow be after thoughts.<br /><br />And my husband was even more disappointed than I was.

I bought the book and had a basic knowledge of Adam, but from page one I could not put this book down.

And if that isn't convincing enough, it's 10X easier to use with the app. I would go online and try and try to repine someting until the point were I got so mad I thought I could break my kindle in half. THANK YOU PINTREST APP!!!!!!!!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I had been hearing about this book for sometime and I didn't know whether or not I wanted to pick it up.  The plot didn't captivate me from the blurbs that I had read in various magazines.  I finally read the book at the insistence of a friend and ultimately I'm glad I did.  It wasn't necessarily what I was expecting.  I'm not giving anything away when I say that the two main characters must dual each other and only one can live.  I guess I was expecting a more active duel where many lives were lost or the characters were continually challenged on a moral level.  I was surprised that I was wrong and it made for a very pleasurable, easy read.  It did remind me a bit of the movie The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus.  All in all, the book didn't have a huge impact on me, nor did it make me think after I put it down, but I liked reading it and I would recommend it for any casual or serious reader.
0525952926|3.0|I awaited this book since reading Fall of Giants, but was slightly disappointed in it. In every book I've ever read by Follet, the characters grab me and make me Feel like I know them personally. But in this one I had trouble differentiating the characters due to their two-dimention blandness. The storyline was quite well drawn and I will definately read the third installment.

If you are shopping for a concise and beautiful book about cookies, look no further. She's got it all wrapped up for you.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game was fun for a while. Then it started doing funky things to my Kindle Fire. The game wouldn't load so I would have to completely shut down my Kindle. Once I was able to open the game, I wasn't able to move around my town or harvest anything. My citizens were coming down with dyptheria or breaking bones and the timer would run out before I had time to create the items needed to help them.
B009CYCF5I|5.0|I cannot stress enough how great this deluxe edition CD is! I've only had it about a week but I constantly keep playing it. The variety of musical styles available on this CD prove once again why P!nk is still awesome! I think the title track \\"The Truth about Love\\" is the best song but there are many other favorites on it. I highly suggest getting the deluxe edition in order to get the bonus tracks. It's worth every penny!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it!!!! I wish the energy would generate faster but I like playing it. I do wish it wasn't. so much like facebook games
B005LAIHY0|3.0|There are some hilarious (and on the money reviews) on the stupidity of the crew actions but this movie was interesting and visually fantastic.  That is if you view the DVD because the BLUE RAY disk is so heavly protected that after the first 15 min. it became unviewable and I had to eject and watch the DVD version.<br />I've read reviews of other BLUE RAY movies with this problem but it's the first for me. Disapointed with 20th Century Fox.

B0049VQZUA|4.0|Season one of TWD is still my favorite and probably always will be.  This was the show that made all of us zombie genre geeks go \\"Yes! Finally someone gets it right!\\".  It's got some episodes that are better than others.  It starts out great and ends great too.  If you love zombie gore and fun, you've come to the right place.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|Only 3 Stars.....because no new extras and not Extended version.<br /><br />I have had the 3D version for 6 months now, compliments of Panasonic.  I love it!  The depth of the 3D rivals cartoon 3D (UP, How to Train Your Dragon, etc.)  I just wonder why the Extended version wasn't released....Perhaps it will go the route of the Star Wars movies, ie:  A new, 'IMPROVED with more features' version every 6 months!  The almighty dollar is the force behind that, I imagine.<br /><br />Welp, This version of AVATAR will not be purchased by me...why duplicate what I already have?<br /><br />20th Century..listen well to me...you want to sell the 3D version and make money?  Release the extended version in 3D....Then I will buy it, as, I am sure, many other 3D TV owners.
B009FZZK8I|4.0|Season three is in one word, dark.  Due to the incessant belly aching over season two the producers decided to give us all the zombie gore we could handle and then some.  Personally, I think this show is going to wrap up soon.  I give it one more season, two at the most.  That's ok, very normal for a show in fact.  It's been a fun ride and it will no doubt be till the end.  Season three adopts some cliches we've all seen with zombie stories, but does so in way that doesn't turn you off.  All of the characters are interesting and fun to watch.  I definately recommend it.
B00933JL0A|4.0|Love this game but, many times when it goes to load up, the game exits on its own. Getting to be aggravating. That problem definitely needs fixed. Other than that, I enjoy playing it.
B005RUV714|3.0|This is the best place I suppose to rate the entire season, I promise not to give any real spoilers.  Season two most certainly is much slower than season one.  I'll bet over time the second season will become more appreciated.  Granted, watching season two after rip roaring season one was like trying to satify yourself with a ride in a Prius after a joyride in a Corvette, but it was more entertaining than the naysayers claim.  Episode one was as intense as what you find in season one, and the last three episodes are as well (especially the final one).  In my personal opinion the investment of character development in season two will only add more to the series as the story continues.  I don't rate it as high as season one for the simple fact that it is true that there are several episodes that are just plain boring.  It's still worth a watching if you are a fan of the show or just simply like zombie flicks.
055380684X|3.0|The Talent Code, by Daniel Coyle, is a book that explores how talent is developed.  After reading the literature, querying experts in academic towers, talking to master coaches, and pounding the pavement to places where talent unexpectedly emerges, Coyle concludes as his subtitle purports that, \\"Greatness isn't born.  It's grown.\\"  Coyle definitely takes you along for an incredible ride on this elegantly written journey.<br /><br />Coyle takes a fascinating look into the psychology of learning and expertise and offers a provocative look at the world  of talent.  All this is well worth the read and is incredible food for thought.  Unfortunately, there is a major flaw here: Coyle isn't interested in other theories of learning or data that doesn't support his thesis. Still, although I do not agree completely with Coyle's outlook, I have to thank him for an excellent read and getting the gears in my head turning.<br /><br />I almost gave this one 4 stars: I found the book infectiously readable and it inspired me to think about and look into research on a very interesting topic.  However, I believe that there are some severe problems with Coyle's conclusions that I will address later in the review.  On rereading my review, these flaws caused me to downgrade my rating to 3 stars. Please realize that in the limited context of an Amazon review, I cannot address all the problems brought up in a 256-page book. Therefore, I have chosen to critique topics that I felt were pivotal and the ones that interested me the most.<br /><br />THE MAJOR POINTS OF THE BOOK/COYLE's POINT OF VIEW<br />As noted above, Coyle's main thesis is that talent and expertise are developed by training and do not rely on innate abilities or genetics. The first part of the book is devoted to discussing how deep practice results in talent and the physiological basis of this.<br /><br />Deliberate (Deep) Practice:<br />His proof is based heavily on deliberate practice theory as demonstrated by K.Anders Ericsson and others.  The deliberate practice school of thought asserts  that genetics have little or nothing to do with the development of talent.  Instead talent (and even genius) is developed by highly targeted practice (called deep practice or deliberate practice), where the learner maintains a laser-like focus on the activity or subject at hand and responds promptly to critical feedback.<br /><br />In deep practice the mind doesn't wander, it hones in on the desired outcome paying close attention to recognizing errors and correcting them.  There may be different methods of achieving deep practice, but the goal of learner is to work at the 'sweet spot'--at the razors edge of his or her ability.  As the theory goes it takes about 10 years/10,000 hours of deep practice to become an expert in any field.<br /><br />The theory is based on seminal work by Ericsson and others, who have observed deep practice at work in the laboratory, calculated the hours logged by experts in many fields prior to achieving expert status, and even analyzed the lives of historical figures.  In all cases, these researhers have found that the 10 year/10,000 hour rule applies.<br /><br />As Coyle would tell us, the moral of the story is that experts, geniuses, savants etc. are NOT somehow special, they have exactly the same machinery as the rest of us.  Coyle boils it down to a simple equation: deep practice x 10,000 hours= world-class skill.  The conclusion is two fold: 1) deliberate practice is what drives learning, and; 2)innate/genetic factors do not matter in the development of expertise, even genius. If you put in your 10 years/10,000 hours you're as good as gold.<br /><br />Coyle backs all this up with scientific studies and some pointed observations that show deep practice at work  He also visits so-called Chicken-wire Harvards--small, humble, and unlikely places that produce mammoth amounts of talent.  Coyle also shows how talent is fostered through expert teaching and coaching.  All this, he quite convincingly exhorts, is the recipe for creating expert talent and genius.<br /><br />Coyle also takes a foray into the physiological basis of learning.  Drawing on the work of Douglas Fields and George Bartzokis, he shows how the developing myelin is the key to developing learned skills.  Basically, myelin is the substance that wraps around neuron (nerve cell) axons (the long projections that jut out from nerve cells that propagate nerve signals).  Myelin insulates, speeds up, and fine tunes nerve signaling.  Because \\"every human movement, thought, or feeling is a precisely timed electric signal traveling down chains of neurons\\" having maximally aligned, networked, and efficient neurons is the key to learning.  For Coyle learning=the development of myelin.<br /><br />Once Coyle has discussed how deliberate (deep) practice is the key to developing talent and expertise, he uses the second part of the book to show concrete examples of how deep practice is motivated. In the third part of the book Coyle show how master coaches (knowingly and unknowingly) use deep practice to train elite athletes and musicians.<br /><br />The epilogue takes a very brief (so brief it was unsatisfying to this reader) look at how the principles outlined in the book might apply to education, business, psychology, aging, and parenting.<br /><br />CRITICISMS, CONTROVERSIES, AND CONUNDRUMS:<br /><br />Make no mistake, all of the above makes for some incredibly interesting and engaging reading.  However, as I read I started to ask some important questions and started searching outside sources for answers.  Please realize that I am no psychologist or neuroscientist (and I sure as heck have not put in the requisite 10,000 hours to become an expert in these areas).  However, even my superficial reading of the literature brought up some controversies that Coyle simply avoids.<br /><br />My goal here is NOT to pop Coyle's bubble or to suggest that he is some kind of charlatan.  He weaves an interesting story and a story that is supported by some eminent experts in the field.  However, Coyle does not present a balanced picture as he leads you down the garden path.  Some critical information is often left out and some of his explanations--although seemingly internally consistent and downright captivating--are more controversial than he lets on and are easily subject to alternative interpretations.<br /><br />As noted above, there is not enough room to fully address all the issues that are brought up by the book. I will try to address the ones that I felt were more pivotal and more interesting to me personally.<br /><br />DIFFICULT DEFINITIONS<br />Talent, expertise, and genius are difficult terms to begin with.  For example, we all agree that proficiency in, say, a musical instrument such as the violin requires talent, but it is often difficult to define what 'true talent' is.  For some, it may mean that someone is able to play a tune by ear.  For others, it may mean that you can play the violin better than most people who are able to play the instrument.  Still to others, it may mean that the talented person must be able to play some of the most complex music ever written for the violin or become a coveted soloist.<br /><br />Expertise and genius are also difficult to define.  How do you define levels of expertise?  When do you know that you have reached it?  Is genius simply being among the best in your field? Does this imply that that you need only a certain level of technical expertise or does it imply that you have to have the ability to create something groundbreaking and new?  Is being an elite athlete simply being able to play better than most people?  Does it mean that you have to be able to play your sport on a professional or Olympic level? What if you play an off-beat sport or come from a country that has lower overall athletic standards? Does it mean that your in the top 30, 20, or 10?  For students in the KIPP schools, success is goingto college.  But for someone who is interested in winning the Nobel Prize, college is but a stepping stone.<br /><br />This ambiguity often makes it difficult to judge some of the claims posited in the book. If you can't agree on what level defines genius or expertise, it's hard to judge whether the 10/10,000 rule applies.  If it's too 'easy' to reach a certain goal, it will, on average, take less than 10/10,000 to get there.  If the definition of 'elite' is too limited (say making it to the podium in the Olympics) and 10/10,000 may not be enough to achieve it (e.g. only three athletes can win a medal in a given sport no matter how much practice the top athletes have put in).<br /><br />Coyle isn't all that helpful in this respect.  He defines talent in a footnote as, \\"the possession of repeatable skills that don't depend on physical size\\" but doesn't clarify how to define genius or expertise.  Which only leaves us with a Justice-Potter-Stewartistic concept of \\"But I know it when I see it...\\"<br /><br />DELIBERATE PRACTICE THEORY/NATURE VERSUS NURTURE:<br />For Coyle and those who adhere to 'orthodox' deliberate practice theory, almost every aspect of talent is determined by deep practice.  This is fine, but it ignores other theories and studies that have real data that could potentially poke holes in the deep practice x 10,000 hours= world-class skill equation.<br /><br />The argument seems to boil down to two distinct issues:<br />1) Whether deliberate (deep) practice improves performance<br />2) Whether deliberate practice (10 year/10,000 hours) is an equalizer without regard to genetic differences in cognitive/athletic abilities (with the caveat that the subjects cannot have organic or acquired cognitive deficits and that some innate physical characteristics, such as height and weight, may make some better or lesser suited for certain athletic pursuits).<br /><br />As to #1, there is little argument. No one contests that deliberate practice will result in improvement of performance.  Even scientists who feel that there is a so-called 'innate' component to talent do not believe that babies are experts upon exiting the womb.  The 'innate' component would simply represent a potential in a given area.  Without deliberate practice, the innate component is irrelevant.<br /><br />The dicey part is conjecture #2.  Is the 10 year/10,000 hours of deliberate practice enough to make you an expert or are there differences between subjects that can't be explained by deliberate practice alone?  Coyle presents the 10/10,000 theory as accepted without question, but a quick look at the scientific literature shows that a healthy debate is raging.<br /><br />There are studies such as those of Baker et al., (JASP, 15: 12--25, 2003), where expertise for certain sports was found to be less than 10,000 hours.  Additionally, Baker et al showed that there was variation between subjects in terms of the amount of deep practice required to become an expert (Basketball 5772-6026 hours, Field Hockey 864-5164 hours, Netball 600-3440 hours). Campitelli and Gobet looked at the role of practice in chess (Developmental Psychology, 43, 159-172) and found that the average amount of deliberate practice necessary for reaching master level was considerable 11,053 hours (very close to the golden 10,000 hours). However, there was also a substantial amount of variability between subjects, with the slowest player requiring 23,608 hours and the fastest player 3,016 hours. Some players with more than 25,000 hours of deliberate practice never reached the master level. [These are only examples.  There are many similar studies done by these and other authors.]<br /><br />You can decide to read, for example, the Campitelli/Gobet paper in any number of ways, including: 1) There is an error in the data collection (lack of understanding about what deliberate practice is/under or over reporting of time by subjects); 2) There is a flaw in the study design; 3) Some subjects performed similar intellectual or physical tasks that were NOT chess based that either helped with chess performance or confounded their ability to perform well at chess; 4) there are other differences (innate, environmental, etc.) between subjects that explain why the 10/10,000 rule doesn't seem to apply.<br /><br />Any way you slice it, however, the data as it stands is not consistent with the 10/10,000 hypothesis.  Please realize that this is not my opinion: it is the data that does not fit with the 10/10,000 hypothesis.  Either the data is in error or some other explanation needs to be found. Please remember, these scientists think statistically.  There isn't any disagreement that there are clear differences between groups (expert, novice, etc.).  There are two bones of contention: 1) do all activities require the same 10/10,000 hours, and; 2) do all subjects require the same amount of time to reach expertise (are the variations between the subjects within each groups statistically significant enough to show that some people require more or less than 10/10,000).<br /><br />My opinion as a non-expert in the field, for whatever it is worth, is that the 10/10,000 hypothesis is a little naive.  All biological systems exhibit variability.  It would be hard to believe that mental and physical capabilities--two incredibly important capabilities that work hand-in-hand when it comes to natural selection/survival--would not exhibit subject-to-subject variability.<br /><br />Anecdotal, non-scientific observations at least hint that not all experts are the same.  When it comes to elite athletes, there are those who consistently fall within the top ten and even fewer who consistently fall within the top three at the World Games and the Olympics.  There are chess masters who consistently win international tournaments and those who don't. The key here is that it is very hard for me to believe that elite athletes who consistently place within the top ten but never quite make the podium are somehow more deficient in deliberate practice when compared to the medalists.  It is hard for me to believe that the chess masters who fall within the top ten or twenty but don't consistently win international tournaments aren't somehow trying hard enough.<br /><br />We also often see that, when working with a group, there are people who simply pick things up more quickly than others.  As Dean Keith Simonton--a researcher that puts a 20 to 30% premium on innate abilities--might put it, those with the golden genes might get more 'bang for the buck' when practicing.  (20 to 30% seems quite high to me, but at the extremes of performance, even a 1 to 2% innate difference might make a difference.)<br /><br />Note as well that there is a very big difference between being highly proficient or even an expert at something and making that leap to genius, where someone makes creative connections and comes up with something completely new. Deliberate practice theorists feel that these creative connections are simply the end result of enough deliberate practice.  But this doesn't explain, for example, why only Liebniz and Newton were the only ones of their generation who came up with the idea of calculus and why only Newton was able to write the Principia where he was able to use calculus to explain natural phenomena. After all, there were other mathematical experts at the time that had all the same tools at hand. Moreover, these tools were available for many, many years prior to the invention of calculus.<br /><br />Before you accuse me of determinism and cynicism, please realize that I am NOT saying that the 10/10,000 theory is wrong. I am stating that it has not been proved beyond a shadow of a doubt. There is data that needs to be explained, so the jury is still out.<br /><br />Science may not care about optimism, but I do. So the simple answer here is that, at very least, deliberate practice theory has demonstrated that we are all far more capable than we may think. There is incredible plasticity within our brains and bodies such that we CAN leverage our physiology with deliberate practice. It may take some 23,608 hours to become a chess master and others 3,016 hours, but the end result is still the same. Even in the worst case scenario where someone spends many, many hours but never becomes a master, his or her performance is still VASTLY improved over his/her baseline with deliberate practice.<br /><br />So, even at very worst, there is no futility here, just a more measured look at the outcomes. Even if the 10/10,000 theory needs to be qualified, there is no way to measure the extent of my capabilities prior to practicing and it doesn't change the fact that I can vastly improve my performance through deliberate practice.<br /><br />PRODIGIES<br />Coyle discounts the existence of prodigies: prodigies are simply the product of driven behavior and unusual amounts of deliberate practice at a much younger age than average.  He points to studies that show that  although prodigies might shine at a young age, on deeper analysis they do not exhibit true expertise/genius until they reach the 10/10,000 hour limit.  Moreover, he cites studies that show that prodigies are overrated in that they are not any more likely to be successful in the long run than persons who start their 10/10,000 hours at a later age.<br /><br />Reviewing the literature, the prodigy studies are historical in nature and therefore 'fuzzy' science for me.  On the one hand it is convincing to know that Mozart likely had 3,500 hours of music instruction from his father by age 6 and that he didn't achieve his genius in composition until his 20s.  (Of course, he did transcribe Allegri's Miserere note for note from memory after only hearing it twice and composed a successful opera around age 14...  However, a lot of historical claims for prodigies were fabricated or their age was fudged to enhance the myth.)  Some prodigy pundits also point out that being a prodigy is not a good predictor of long term success.<br /><br />Still, other researchers point to the existence of modern prodigies whose lives have been well documented.  For example, Sarah Chang, a successful violinist who received a violin by her 4th birthday, was accepted in Julliard at age 5, and who was a soloist with the New York Philharmonic at age 8.  This kind of history gives one pause.  As to lack of success for prodigies, it could be argued that success is generally a difficult thing for anyone to achieve.  Moreover, we are plagued by the absence of a denominator.  It is hard to say that prodigies are any more or less successful than the rest of society when we can't calculate a true success rate for either group.<br /><br />(Other possibilities: prodigies may 'burn out' after spending excessive time early on in a singular pursuit.  Alternatively, you could apply a somewhat circular style of reasoning and state that prodigies who don't make it were not 'true' prodigies at all.  They were simply people with average capabilities that applied the 10/10,000 rule and looked somehow remarkable because they reached their peak earlier than most.)<br /><br />CHICKEN-WIRE HARVARDS<br />Coyle points to Chicken-wire Harvards--humble hotbeds of talent production that have few major resources but create massive amounts of talent.  I won't mention all the places that Coyle does, but will point out some discrepancies.  Coyle paints a deliberate picture of these chicken-wire Harvards.  Often, however, he leaves off important information that might allow a place to be seen in a different light.  He also offers a single, plausible interpretation of events that fits with his thesis, neglecting other plausible interpretations that don't quite fit his theory.<br /><br />--Meadowmount School of Music: a remote music camp in Upstate New York that is well known to produce major talent.  First, Meadowmount is really a 7-week summer program, not a full blown music school. There is an auditioning process.  You don't make it into Meadowmount unless you are talented to begin with.  Let's look at some graduates by doing a quick web search... Pinchas Zuckerman: began music studies at age 4; started violin at age 8; discovered at age 14 and shipped off to Julliard.  So, he did spend time at Meadowmount, but he also received extensive training in Israel and at Julliard.  Yo-Yo Ma: began violin and viola, until he settled on the cello at age 4. Performed concerts at age 5.  Performed concerts for US Presidents at age 7.  Television debut at age 8.  Studied at Julliard and eventually enrolled in the not-so-chicken-wire Harvard University.  That said, I don't want to take anything away from Meadowmount.  It may be that the school left an indelible impression on Zuckerman and Ma.  But, however seminal an experience, it is hard to give all the credit to Meadowmount for these and other already extremely talented musicians who crossed the Meadowmount threshold.<br /><br />--The Spartak Tennis Club: a \\"freezing junkpile that has produced a volcano of talent.\\"  Of the students mentioned, I found some quick information on Anna Kournikova, Marat Safin, and Dinara Safin.  Kournikova attended Spartak from age 6.  By age 10, she was shipped off to Brandenton, Florida where she trained in a much more posh setting with Nick Bolletieri.  Marat Safin and Dinara Safina's parents were on staff at Spartak.  Marat trained there until age 14 and Dinara until age 8, when both moved to Spain and more stylish quarters.  It took Marat 3 years and Dinara 6 years in Spain before going pro.  Spartak starts off with many, many young tennis players and ends up promoting the few that make the grade.  There is no question that Spartak is definitely a place where raw talent can be found, but spotting raw talent is a somewhat different skill than nurturing that talent to fruition. (That said, the staff at Spartak will have to duke it out with Bolletieri, regarding who had the most influenceon Kournikova's career.)<br /><br />--Futsal:  Futsal is a quick paced, soccer-like game that is played on a much smaller field.  The game developed in Brazil and Coyle attributes the development of Futsal to the success of Brazilian soccer. He attributes this to the fact that Futsal is a much faster game than soccer, players get more action, and that players touch the ball more times than in regular soccer.  I believe that all this has a certain historical validity. But as Coyle also points out, Brazil has an incredible, national interest in soccer but its cities have a paucity of open fields in which to play soccer.  By shrinking the game down in size, futsal courts can be found all over Brazilian cities.  This makes futsal incredibly available to the people in the same way basketball is brought to the people in the United States.  Interest+available courts=more people playing the game.  More people playing the game gives you a larger pool to pull from in terms of talent and a place to hone it.  That said, there's evidence here for the effects of deliberate practice, but it doesn't rule out the ability to winnow out 'natural' talent, if such a thing exists.<br /><br />OH, MY! OH, MYELIN!<br />Coyle goes so far as to produce a physiological correlate to deliberate practice. I do understand that the science of how we learn on a cellular level is of interest to Coyle.  At first, I thought that the meylin stuff was mostly used as an easy-to-explain metaphor for how learning occurs in the central nervous system.  In fact, I wouldn't even comment on this topic at all if it wasn't such a pervasive feature of the book.  By the end, however, I was almost banging my head against the wall when Coyle mentioned myelin... over and over and over... and over.<br /><br />So here goes: Generally, we are not born with nerve cells within our brains that are maximally aligned, maximally networked, or maximally efficient.  The nerve cells are basically the working units of the brain and communicate with each other by transferring electrical signals.  These signals are transported by projections off the nerve cell called axons. By improving the reliability, speed, and accuracy of nerve signals, we improve our skills. (I'm okay with this, so far.)<br /><br />Coyle's assertion is that by performing deep practice, we improve our myelin, allowing for maximally efficient nerve circuits.  For Coyle, the development of talent IS the development of myelin.<br /><br />I'm not against scientific revelations. I realize that the glial cells that produce the myelin were much maligned when I was learning this stuff in high school biology.  Nerve cells themselves were the stars of the show and the myelin producing glial cells were just `helper cells' that kept those sexy neurons happy.  Yes.  Glial cells and myelin are far more important than we ever thought before.<br /><br />Once again, I'm no neuroscientist, but a quick canvass of the literature reveals that learning is NOT simply the production of myelin.  It is a far more complex process.  Learning=myelin is a convenient metaphor but it is not the whole ball of wax.  To give a really poor analogy, the learning=myelin metaphor is like saying that to get full function from an internal combustion engine, firing six cylinders is better than firing only four cylinders.  Yeah, that's true, but if the spark plugs aren't in place, none of the cylinders will function.  And if there's no crankshaft, your wheels will never turn.  And by playing around with a bunch of gear ratios and improving efficiency, you can probably squeeze out a lot more function with one four cylinder set up than another.<br /><br />If you talk to a myelin scientist, my guess is that they get a little over excited and start stating theory as a fact.  So I'm going to go out on a limb here and throw a wrench into some of Coyle's stranger assertions:<br /><br />1) Maybe we have 20% more myelin than monkeys do, but this isn't the only reason why monkeys can't speak.  At least one of the other reasons has to do with well developed language centers that are genetically hardwired into our brains.  You could myelinate the crap out of a monkey and it still wouldn't have human speech capabilities.  (Then again, monkeys don't have to put up with bad reality TV, so they may have an evolutionary advantage here.)<br /><br />2) I can't find a paper to support evidence of increased myelin in the brains breast fed babies as opposed to formula fed ones.  But even assuming that breast fed babies get more Omega 3 fatty acids than their formula fed counterparts and that this actually does give them more myelin, there may be psychosocial reasons why they are smarter; for example they may have a closer bond with their mother.  See Harlow's monkey experiments for an extreme example of how nurturing might affect fear, security, and attachment in a baby, all of which potentially could affect intelligence. Myelin may play a part here, but it's hard to saythat myelin is the only issue.<br /><br />3) Michael Jordan's musculoskeletal system is just as subject to age as his neural network.  I'm sure his myelin was affected by age, but age related declines in athletic performance likely reflect age-related changes in all body systems.<br /><br />4) Neanderthals may have supplanted Cro-Magnon man, but it would be hard to pin it all on myelin.  First, there are other components apart from myelin that are responsible for intellectual function.  Moreover, there might have been other genetic and environmental factors involved.<br /><br />5) Horses walk at birth, as do many large mammals.  It's hard for me to believe that this is simply a myelin factor.  A human infant (or rat infant or mouse infant) may have a myelin deficiency, but they also lack a musculoskeletal system that can support their weight.  Horses need to walk at birth for survival, so all this is built in.  Myelin may be a part of the story, but it's not the entire story.<br /><br />6) Adolescents may make bad decisions, but it's certainly not only because their frontal lobe isn't myelinated enough.  Myelination does increase as adolescents grow older, but this is correlational data.  It would be impossible to say whether frontal lobe myelination is simply an age related change that has nothing to do with decisions making capacity or something that truly affects higher cognition and decision making.  For example, adolescents don't make better decisions because they go through growth spurts and become taller. Let's not forget as well that adolescence is accompanied with many, many other changes that could affect decision making; for example, hormonal changes.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />Coyle has written a very interesting and very provocative book.  My main gripe is that the book is one sided--Coyle did not present a balanced view of the state of the science of learning.  A more nuanced view would likely have been more difficult to write, but would probably have been even more interesting to read.  Still, The Talent Code brings up extremely profound and compelling issues regarding development of expertise and compelled me to look more deeply at these issues.  It may not be perfect, but for me it was well worth the read.
B002ZG99A4|3.0|There's a whole lot of action but a very weak plot.  After seeing it once, I won't watch it again.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app!  It offers both sticky notes, checklists, and calendar reminders. It is very easy to use and I can color code things as needed - - great product!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn is one if the best psychological/thriller/suspense/drama writer of all time! I literally stayed up all night reading this book and then I went right to her next book and I think I read every one of her books in about a week and a half!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love the game... it has quite a challenge. It's a jewel-matching game with a good story and the puzzles present a challeange.
B000FC146C|5.0|A must read for every generation. This sweeping saga will have you show every emotion and you will love it. Thank you Colleen for this masterful tale.
0307383415|1.0|I bought this book because I was curious.  Frankly, I'm not voting for Obama and wanted to fact check some comments myself.  This is especially true because the movie 2016 is drawing mostly on comments from this book as well as on the book The Rage of Obama.  I didn't want, however, to contribute to Obama's millions of dollars of rolayties so I bought this book for 1 cent.  I stopped reading it after 10 pages and threw it away.  Actually, I threw it out with in the reclyes bin.<br /><br />I remembered later that there was talked that J. Ayers, the self avowed murderer, was the ghost author of this book.  I'm gldd I threw it away and will just watch the 2016 DVD I recently ordered.<br /><br />Update 6/11/13: Surprise; he's a corrupt dictator.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I was skeptical at first to watch a 'zombie' TV series but the plot and acting caught my attention from the start.  The first episode had the flavor of an old flick titled 'Day of the Triffids', which I, and I'm sure many other Baby Boomers will agree, enjoyed.  The story line proceeds smoothly (with some bumps) throughout.  One gets used to smashed skulls, brains and blood very quickly.  The make-up and special effects are supurb.  I had to buy the second season (which I never do) to see where it's all going.  Now I'm dvr-ing the third seasoning.  Hooked I am. Worthy entertainment.
B009329Y30|5.0|Nice feel good movie.  Although there were tense and sad moments, overall the movie was very enjoyable.  Only downside was that it seemed to follow a 1950s era stereotype of southern law enforcement, but that was probably necessary to make the storyline work.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Well worth seeing and I would have rated this film as a 4-star except for the fact that It doesn't inform the viewer that it is related to the \\"Alien\\" series until well into the film.  So I thought it was copying \\"Alien(s)\\" and I resented it for that until well into the film.<br /><br />Once I realized that it was a prequel or sequel of the \\"Alien\\" series, I enjoyed it immensly.  Now I'll be watching for the \\"Prometheus\\" sequel(s)with great anticipation!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Good game.  I like it.  Good for relaxing before going to sleep.  Nice and realistic graphics and game play. Needs a little better instructions so you don't have to figure out the finer points by trial and error.  Highly recommended.  Just like the old game at the carnival!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|When I saw this in theaters I loved it, so of course we had to get this 4-disc combo pack from Amazon to enjoy this movie over and over again.<br /><br />This case comes packed with lots of extra things to watch and enjoy if you loved the Avengers movie. I have rewatched it several times already and plan to watch it many many more!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I found \\"Les Miserables\\" an interesting combination of history and fiction. The characters though spread through several years of time were all intertwined to make the entire book (of several books) tie together.  It made me feel like I was right there with each character as they struggled through their lives.  I look forward to seeing on the big screen.
B007RTAR64|4.0|I am a Barbie lover and I also love both the book and the movie The Hunger Games.  So when I saw this doll I fell in love with it, however, the discription and the doll are two very different things.  First this doll's discription said that it was a likeness of the lead female actress in the movie and it also said that the doll had all of the added items that Katniss would have had in the movie.  Well, first off the doll does not look like the actress I mean it is close but it is not the actress, and second, it does have the bow and arrows and her outfit but it does not include the backpack that she had in the movie.  All in all the doll is nice but it is not the complete package.  This is the second time that I got one of the newer Barbies and the second time that my expectations were not fully met.  The Barbies of today are a far cry from the ones even 10 years ago.  I just hope that my next purchase is a really good one.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I've always been a Frank Ocean fan but this album was amazing . It wasn't as magnificent as The Lonny Breaux Collection but on a scale of 1-10 , it's about 250 :) . Frank Ocean doesn't do all of the crazy notes in his voice that you'll hear with other artists such as Beyonce , but it works for him . The simplicity in his voice gives him power . His intricate , descriptive lyrics leave you wanting to listen to the same songs over & over again without ever getting tired of them . I can already tell that this is going to be a classic, timeless album .
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not sure if this was a book for me but I couldn't put if down. I read all three books in four days. It had suspense, drama, sex and more. It may not be for everyone but I enjoyed it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is awesome. I cant put it down. my new fav app. I play for hours every day. Great free app
B003TSEL7S|4.0|So I was a huge fan of Rick's Percy Jackson series, it was a wonderful series that drew me in. But this review isn't about Percy Jackson it's about the Heroes of Olympus and more specifically The Lost Hero. So I bought this book by chance just taking a browse through some books for a possible new book to read. I'm only currently halfway through but none the less, this book is wonderful and if you were a fan of the first series you'll enjoy meeting characters from it in this series. I've been addicted to it and am really working to finish it. It makes break times and lunch times at work a lot faster because I'm reading and it's wonderfully.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Popcorn movie of the summer! It was really fun and can't wait for the next one. Hope it will be as great as this one was!
B000T9W5MI|5.0|true. hollywood can be over the top or under the rug.<br />this movie will move you faster then freddy croger -- walking on elms st.<br />ever read a book that you couldn't put down ?<br />ever saw a movie that made you feel that you were literally glued to the sofa ?<br />you guessed it -- this movie makes you feel like the later / former.<br /><br />like action realistic movies that compel you to see / think about governments / political trades / madness etc.,? -- look no more.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Great season, very intense and unexspected. Still like season 3 the best, but no let downs here. Cant wait for season 7!
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Seriously, guys, couldn't you at least *tune* your piano before you recorded Arwen's Song??  That stupid B4 kills me!  I can't listen to that song, and I was very disappointed that the 5 of you (plus however many other people heard the song) didn't catch this!  It's just painful.<br /><br />Other than that, I adore your CD, and I've listened to it 100+ times since I got it two weeks ago.  It's fabulous.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a great app. I think it makes pintrest better then on the PC. its never given me an issue and works everytime I use it. every member of pintrest should download this.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I did not have high expectations for this game when I downloaded it.  The title alone had my thinking that it was going to be some kind of crappy Plants vs. Zombies rip-off.  But I couldn't argue with the price, so I gave it a download.<br /><br />And as it turns out, I was pleasantly surprised.  It plays somewhat like a single-played MOBA game (LoL, HoN, Dota 2) but mixed with an RTS.  You have a hero, a samurai initially, though later you can unlock a zombie hero to play as.  This hero has to fight off waves of enemies on a side-scrolling field and keep them from destroying his base.  You can move the hero by tapping and holding either side of the screen and he will automatically use his basic attacks when in range of his opponent.  The skill element of the game comes in knowing when to move him in to attack and when to keep him away from the various enemies that he fights.  His initial melee attack can be used to knock enemies back and slow them down, this is very useful for buying time for the other aspect of the game, cooldowns and units.<br /><br />As the game progresses, you build up leadership points which allow you to deploy units to fight the zombies, such as farmers, warriors, archers, heroes, and other troops.  You are also allowed to choose from two abilities that you bring with you in to the fight, which confer bonuses such as, summoning additional temporary troops, performing an AoE attack on enemies, or slowing the enemy army for a short amount of time.<br /><br />Enemies drop currency and items when can be used in between levels to upgrade your hero, his weapons, his units, or to buy and upgrade structures that aid in base defense, such as a bell that damages demons, or archers that shoot enemies that get too close to the base.<br /><br />There is a surprising amount of depth and effort that went into this game.  The music is fitting, and the sound effects are great.  The units are all very well done and are easily distinguishable in the field of battle, the animations are smooth, and I only encounter the very smallest of framerate issues at times.  Really the only things that bug me at times are the inevitable occurrence in pretty much any game you get for 'Free' these days.<br /><br />As I mentioned before you buy upgrades in between waves.  But it's worth mentioning that some of these upgrades cannot be purchased with the normal currency that you get for beating levels.  These upgrades can only be bought with special coins, which only ever drop VERY rarely in the game, or purchased from the game makers, for real money.  Now, it's worth mentioning that these upgrades are far from essential for playing the game, I've gotten 30 or so levels in with no need to spend even a single cent, the drops from enemies and from the pachinko mini-game more than enough to see me through up to this point.  This hasn't been the case in the zombie defense mode, which seems to be FAR more difficult than the samurai mode.  I'm not really sure why this is, perhaps I'm simply playing it wrong, but many of the units in that mode seem to be stronger and harder to deal with, almost requiring the player to use charms just to stand a chance of winning.<br /><br />It also remains to be seen if I will be able to continue to perform as well as I am in the regular game as things progress.  It may be that the further I get in the game the more likely it is that I will have to purchase one of these 'special' upgrades.<br /><br />I can't really begrudge the gamemakers for this, after all, they have to make money somehow, but it's still frustrating, and and ever-present reminder of the facebook-game method of nickel and diming players for all their worth that's become ever prevalent.<br /><br />These grumps aside, this game is a lot of fun, and at the low, low, price of $0 well worth a download.<br /><br />Grab it for your Kindle and go kill some zombies!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait for the next one... Best series in a long time that will always keep you on your feet.
0553374842|4.0|Amazing book, and what makes it worth buying are the incredible Mcquarries illustrations, the guy was a genius. The book has a nice glossy paper, really beautiful.<br />Such a pity the book has no hard cover, the material is really beautiful and deserved a better cover, but still is a great edition.
