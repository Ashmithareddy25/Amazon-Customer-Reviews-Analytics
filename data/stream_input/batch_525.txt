0156030209|1.0|I have to say, I'm glad I finished the book. Because, This book is a very gory book. It was sickening, disturbing, and I can't believe it was in my school library. It describes all the details of an inside of an animal, (when the zebra is killed), and not only that, It has a bit too much dialogue.<br /><br />This book is about a hindu boy who is shipwrecked somewhere along Boreno. He later on befriends a 450- pound tiger, and later on the tiger becomes gung-ho on other animals on the island. Unfourtanatly, I was dissapointed because of the \\"reccomended age\\" level is 10-16. MORE LIKE 14-23! anyways, good book, but FIZZLING QUICKLY!
B000068QZK|5.0|......then this album would be the picture next to it!! I'm dead serious, you don't like it then don't read this review cuz all I got is good stuff:<br /><br />The Original Track list:<br />1. Miracle Man: I heard this song before I bought this album because I had the 6-track \\"Just Say Ozzy\\" EP (WTF was I thinking?) and thought it was great, but this version is that much greater! The intro to this is awesome with Zakk's 'Wylde' riffs and Ozzy's inventive lyrics for the hypocritical Jimmy Swagert. By the way Zakk's solo is great, it sonds part Van Halen part Satriani inspired 10/10<br /><br />2. Devil's Daughter (Holy War): I think this has got to be one of Ozzy's most underrated songs, I'll even go as far as saying this should have been a hit instead of Crazy Babies (which was really weird in the first place). The bass and riffs on this are awesome and Ozzy has a certain dramatic flair on this piece.  Definitely a 10/10.<br /><br />3. Crazy Babies: I used to think that this song was kind of weird, I still do but in a lyrical sense and not songwise sense. THere is GREAT guitar spots throughout this track by Wylde and the tempo is just outstanding. Even Ozz's party boy lines are great on here. 9/10<br /><br />4. Breaking all the Rules: A truly balls-to-the-wall track. From the heavy intro all the way to the 'rules' chant is awesomeness. It's easy to see why this became a hit. 9/10<br /><br />5. Bloodbath in Paradise: Before going on with this track review I just want to address a few things: in the booklet for the newly remastered edition they say this is Vietnam inspired. Thats crazy, anyone with half a brain stem can tell just by LISTENING not even having to read the lyrics that it is inspired from the Manson family! Now onto the review: This songg is absolutely #$#%ng unbelievable. In fact I would rate it next to some of the tracks from Blizzard/Diary. Listen and make your own judgement. Rating: makes the \\"Helter Skelter\\" movie look like bull#$%t. 11/10<br /><br />6. Fire In the Sky: FIrst off let me just say to all of those that are like : \\"Zakk's solo in FIre in the SKy is better than any of Randy's solos.\\" I disagree. In fact, I think that there will never be anyone who can or will be as great as Randy Rhoads was, but I'll get to that later (saving it for my 'Tribute' review). I will say though that this solo is proof of why Zakk is Ozzy's guitarist: the guitar solo is sooooo unbelievably great that only a Mega-virtuoso like Wylde could pull off. The other thing about this is that it shows the beauty of Zakks guitar playing: he played so beautifully that it still keeps the melodic-like atmosphere while having the ubergreat virtuoso solo. THis song would have sounded great on Bill and Tedds Excellent Adventure (random but pratical). Rating: If only the Gods were mortal men with guitars, then they would be like Zakk Wylde! This track is easily the greatest on the album and I would rate it with the best of Blizzard of Ozz and daresay even Diary of a Madman. THe solo spot in my opinion is also better that No More Tears. 25/10<br /><br />7. Tattoed Dancer: This song seems kind of out of place with the rest of the material. Of course the percussion on this is outstanding: Randy Castillo is such an awesome drummer, in fact I consider him one of the greatest in the history of heavy metal (face reality he could kick the crap out of Lee Kerslake and Tommy Aldridge, as great as they are.) But the lyrics, they are sooo UNOZZY! Leave writing dirty songs to Poison or Motley Crue, not Ozzy. Admit it, it's really awkward to hear Ozzy scream: \\"Dance for me b#$ch!\\" with that said I would have to give it an 11/10 because the drumming unbelievable.<br /><br />8. Demon Alcohol: Unlike what the 'professional' critics say, I don't consider this a sequel to suicide solution because when Ozzy made Suicide Solution it was a tribute to his dearly departed friend and beer buddy Bon Scott. Demon Alcohol is about his own problem, which means it is notthat sequel they are talking about. Nice riffs and beats throughout and the mention of 'suicide solutions' in there is just lyrical genious on Ozzy's part. 10/10<br /><br />9. Hero: Supposedly the hidden track on the original cd version, it seems that the Ozzy camp has gotten smart enough to include it on the track listing this time. A beautiful ballard, you can definitely hear the emotion in the music. I think that this song is really about how much Ozzy gives to the audience whenever he is out there in frontman form, which if you ask me even in his old crippled state now, his voice sounds like crap, he may limp like a 150 year old, but the heart of the man is still there. and this song says it all. Rating: It comes from the heart of the man, that is one thing I can not rate, but if I could I would give it an 11/10<br /><br />Extra Tracks:<br />10. The Liar: I can't believe they didn't keep this track on here! It would have fit perfectly well right after 'Hero'. In alot of ways this reminds me of 'Spiders', the bonus track on BATM. There is a light melodic bass line throughout and at times a little bit of riff, good for soothing ones spirit when down. 10/10<br /><br />11. Miracle Man(Live): Better than the normal version and way better than the JSO version. It somehow keeps the riff atmopshere of the original but yet at the same time keep the live production atmosphere of JSO. LIsten to this and you can tell that Ozzy just loves stickin it to the man, which in this case is Jimmy Swaggert. I like this version better than Just Say Ozzy because there is more of a live feel in this one (for example in the middle of the song Ozzy shouts: \\"everybody clap your f#$%#ng hands!\\") YOu should definitely check out the 2002 remaster. 11/10<br /><br />NOw if you don't like this album, then you are a big fat retard! Don't worry I'm just kiddn'! However, if you don't like it then give a legitamite excuse besides \\"I don't like Ozzy\\" or some crazy crap like that. I for one obey the guidelines, you should too.<br />Out of all of Ozzy's albums, this would be my fourth favorite. Here's how I would rate Ozzy's albums from best to worst:<br /><br />1.Randy Rhoads Tribute<br />2.Diary of a Madman<br />3.Blizzard of Ozz<br />4.No Rest for the Wicked<br />5.No More Tears<br />6.The Ultimate Sin<br />7.Live and Loud<br />8.Just Say Ozzy<br />9.Speak of the Devil<br />10.Bark at the Moon<br />11.Ozzmosis<br />Anything after Ozzmosis isn't really worth adding on here.and the mention of 'suicide solutions' in there is just lyrical genious on Ozzy's part. 10/10    9.

0767812166|3.0|The story line was acceptable but lack continuity and reality in the category of a science fiction movie. <br /> <br />After a few minutes into the movie you feel that it is like any other domestic movie involving the drama of two fugitives. <br /> <br />Maybe it was produced in the 80s when expectation on special effects and sci fi type action were not so demanding. <br /> <br />Anyway the acting was reasonably good and factual.
B000000OQF|5.0|My old review was just a bashing of Led Zeppelin fanatics who insult other bands works, so this one is an actual review. You could call it remastered. Hahahahahaha! I kill myself with laughter. Anyway in the 80's hair metal had dominated the stage and all of the tough boys had turn soft in order to get commercial and gain big bucks. Well, Guns n' friggn Roses is going to change all that. Weeks after its debut Appetite already has teens not taking baths and combing their hair and cussin out their Algebra II teacher for being \\"So Easy\\" and telling their sister to \\"turn around B#$ch I got a use for you, besides you aint got nothin better to do!\\" But all incest jokes aside, here is how I describe Appetite for Destruction.<br /><br />Track Listing:<br /><br />1.Welcome to the Jungle: Welcome to the Jungle! We got riffs and lyrics, and decadence beyond magnitude. A song about entering LA in search for a new life, the introduction to Gun's N' ROses and I can't think of a better first song than this! 10/10<br /><br />2.It's So Easy: The most underated hit on this album next to Mr. Brownstone. The bass intro by DUff is legend, every band I worked with opens their show with that bass riff. Also when Axl tells you to \\"F#$k off!\\" and Slash solos are the other trademark of the album. 10/10<br /><br />3.Nighttrain: In my opinion greater than Welcome to the Jungle. This is the quintessential GnR concert opener, because it is loud and extremely lyrical. The whole band does amazingly well on this track. 10/10<br /><br />4.Out Ta Get Me: A little weird coming after Nighttrain but great nonetheless. A little FU rock mixed with fast beat riffs make this a must-hear. 9/10<br /><br />5.Mr Brownstone: One of GnR's most underated hits, the drums on this track are amazing. If you think Steven did a great job wait till you hear it with Matt on drums. 10/10<br /><br />6.Paradise City: An absolute must-hear, one of GnR's greatest hits and in my opinion the best song on this album. Axl's vocals are top-notch and SLash's guitar riffs are amazing. 11/10<br /><br />7.My Michelle: A story of a druggie-addict call girl whose mother is in the ground and has a drunk father. Axl has great vocals but suffers from only being 3 and some odd minutes long. 9.2/10<br /><br />8.Think About You: In my opinion the most underated song on the album. It's a love story about a guy and this girl he has known for a long time and when he his drunk or high he thinks about her. Great lyrics, for those who have a childhood love they just can't reach. 10/10<br /><br />9.Sweet Child O'Mine: The quintessential metal ballad. I never got the message of it, I think it is about Axl having a crush on a 15 year old (that's a joke, just ignore) but anything is open for interpretation. One of the best power ballads out there, a must listen too. 11/10<br /><br />10.You're Crazy: One of cuss rock's early songs. Originally recorded as an acoustic track (see my Lies review) this electric version is more racy, rocky, and loud. Axl's vocals also sound alot more sober too. 11/10<br /><br />11.Anything Goes: A weird song. I know what I said about Hollywood Rose and if possible get their version of this song because it is way better. This version has weird toy noises and sounds like a big band performance. 7/10<br /><br />12.Rocket Queen: I never really got this song, it has nice guitar tone and lyrics, but the bass seems a little heavy at times. The distortion is unnecessary but the message is sure. 8/10<br /><br />Guns n' Roses rating:<br /><br />1.Use Your Illusion II<br /><br />2.Use Your Illusion I<br /><br />3.Appetite for Destruction<br /><br />4.Live Era: 87-93<br /><br />5.GnR Lies<br /><br />6.The Spaghetti Incident?uitar riffs are amazing. 11/10 <br />7.My Michelle: A story of a druggie-addict call girl whose mother is in the ground and has a drunk father.

B0000TB050|2.0|No doubt if you're a U2 fan this will probably be the best of the series. U2 is a good bar band that has garnered a following over the years, however, I am getting tired of bands that utilize their fame for \\"political statement\\" as they do on U2 Go Home. Sort of a wannabe youth lobby, although I suspect they've sold a few with this tack.  <br />When I purchase a Music/Concert DVD I want to be entertained, not hit over the head with a pseudo intellectual (and half baked) political commentary, and I'm not even a Republican. <br />The sound is good in dts 5.1 surround but not great, I have yet to hear anything as good as the Eagles \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" albeit this one is a studio production. <br />The best concert DVD for pure adrenalin in 5.1 Dolby Only (no dts) unfortunately, but still of the bar band variety, is INXS Live Baby Live. An oldie when INXS AND the late Michael Hutchence AND 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium got caught up in a two hour ride of unprecedented energy. Contrast this with U2 Go Home and the crowd was barely awake after the third song. <br />If you want to hear contemporary state of the art music and musicians and your taste has evolved well past the bar band but you still like a stage venue try \\"Sting - The Brand New Day Tour - Live from the Universal Amphitheatre\\". Unfortunately also only in Dolby 5.1 (not dts) but well worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />U2 Go Home!
B000002J09|4.0|Please can someone answer that please! How can you get that from the fourth Led Zeppelin album! which brings me to my next point, does it really matter what it is called? The reason I'm asking this is because whenever I talk about this 'album' with Zeppelin fans they are always like: \\"It is not called Led Zeppelin 4, it is the fourth Led Zeppelin album.\\" How are people supposed to know what the heck I am talkin about if I can't use any roman numerals! This is a disgrace, I should give it 0 stars! But then again the package looks cool, I think I'll give it 5. But then again, I don't need to listen to Stairway to Heaven again, 4 points to team Zeppelin and that's the game!
B0000TLA9G|1.0|This album is more or less major crap, especially when it's coming from the last good rock band. If you want to get into Guns N' Roses, go get Appetite For Destruction, don't get this. Don't get me wrong, I love most of the album, but it's not really great for a greatest hits. First of all, why are there only 3 songs from AFD on here? The inclusion of Nightrain, Out Ta Get Me, It's So Easy, Mr. Brownstone and Rocket Queen are all essential songs by GN'R. Now, more songs from Lies would have been nice too. I Used To Love Her is a great song, and also one of their most famous hits. And to give it something from all the albums, Mama Kin or Reckless Life should have been included. Now onto the Use Your Illusions. The songs picked from Use Your Ullusion's I and II was much better than you could expect on an album like this. There were really only 2 problems with the stuff from these albums. First, 7 songs from UYI I and II is WAY too much if they can only put on 3 songs from AFD. Second, Civil War and Yesterdays should have been cut and replaced with Estranged, quite possibly the best song between the 2 albums. Finally, \\"The Spaghetti Incedent?\\" songs. For an album that recieves as little praise as this, 2 songs seems like a bit much. Both great songs, especially Since I Don't Have You. <br /> <br />Although it's tough to make a compilation for a band of such magnitude, this list would serve damn well: <br />Welcome To The Jungle (AFD) <br />It's So Easy (AFD) <br />Nightrain (AFD) <br />Out Ta Get Me (AFD) <br />Mr. Brownstone (AFD) <br />Paradise City (AFD) <br />Sweet Child O' Mine (AFD) <br />Rocket Queen (AFD) <br />Mama Kin (LLAS) <br />Patience (Lies) <br />I Used To Love Her (Lies) <br />Live And Let Die (UYI I) <br />Don't Cry (UYI I) <br />November Rain (UYI I) <br />Knockin' On Heaven's Door (UYI II) <br />Get In The Ring (UYI II) <br />Estranged (UYI II) <br />You Could Be Mine (UYI II) <br />Since I Don't Have You (\\"TSI?\\") <br />Hair Of The Dog (\\"TSI?\\") <br/>Oh My God (End Of Days soundtrack/Chinese Democracy) <br /> <br />One last thing, the most important reason not to buy it...the band wouldn't want you to. When Axl and former Gunners Slash, Duff and Matt heard about Geffen's idea to release a greatest hits to \\"tide people over until Chinese Democracy\\", they protested. Obviously, they lost in the end, but would GN'R really want you to buy an album that they never wanted released? And if you want it just so you can get Sympathy For The Devil, download it on iTunes, it'll save you $12 bucks.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|I bought \\"Guilty\\" in 1980 on vinyl, then on CD the moment it came out. It was always in the top ten favorite list of Barbra albums. <br /> <br />Now I have the newly minted 25th Anniversary Edition, and it has moved up to the top 2! \\"Guilty Pleasures\\", though not yet released, will be the other one in the top 2. <br /> <br />Barbra's vocals teamed with Barry's production are pure heaven. Every song is like buttah. <br /> <br />\\"Woman in Love\\" is perfection. I get goosebumps when she hits and holds that looooooong note. <br /> <br />\\"The Love Inside\\" was never a favorite for me back in 1980, but I have sort of rediscovered it, and I am amazed at the beauty in it. I find myself listening to it over and over again these days. <br /> <br />\\"Life Story\\" is another WOW track. So dramatic and surging. <br /> <br />\\"Make it Like a Memory\\" is to die for. Truly takes your breath away. <br /> <br />I would have given the CD 10 stars if there were room to add more, but I'll have to settle for the 5 alloted. If you never heard this CD, I strongly suggest you buy it NOW! If you had the original LP or CD, I still strongly suggest you get it - the newly spiffed up version is worth every cent! <br /> <br />Great work, Barbra & Barry! <br />
B000AADYYO|5.0|This cd is amazing.  I have always been a fan of Opeth's slower, acoustic songs (\\"Damnation\\" being my favorite cd).  The blend of death metal riffs, and vocals fits together with the slower music so well.  The whole cd is good, there is not one bad song on here.   <br />I think everyone should go pick this one up...
B000000W5B|5.0|The year was 1973. The band had just gone on a highly successful U.S. tour in support of their album from the previous year; \\"Exile on Main Street\\" (ever heard of it?). Not only has 'Exile' been named as the band's best album on numerous occasions, it is also in line with a string of albums that have also been considered the bands best (Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed & Sticky Fingers). So when the band began recording this, they were coming off of alot. Upon the record's release, it was considered a dissapointment (but hey, so was 'Exile' at the time!). In fact, many people STILL consider it a dissapointment. Me? I consider it timeless. <br /> <br />1. Dancing With Mr. D - Starts with a lazy sounding riff that can be described as a slower variation of the riff to their 1971 song 'Bitch'. Infact, the whole song has a 'lazy' sort of vibe to it, so it really sets the mood of the album. Spooky overtones and somewhat dark in content (even if it does come off as sounding a bit contrived). It chugs along nicely as a slow paced rocker. Some may describe it as corny, but I wouldn't call it bad AND it has a nice chorus to boot. It does seem to go on a bit too long though and the song really isn't THAT strong. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />2. 100 Years Ago - Now we're talking. Not a rocker, more like \\"power pop\\", but it still....rocks! The verse melody is one of the catchiest Mick has ever come up with and Mick Taylor plays a nice wah wah guitar throughout. There is a loose jam at the end where Charlie is pounding the drums as hard as ever and Mick Taylor is tearing it up on his guitar. Perfect. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Coming Down Again - One of the first Keith sung ballads. This is actually a strong effort though. It does go on a bit too long, but it's very laid back sounding. Deals with his drug addiction, I would say. Has a nice dreamy electric guitar sound. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />4. Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker) - You still hear this one on the radio from time to time. More nice wahwah guitar from Mick Taylor. This song can be described as a funk rocker. Considered a classic, deservingly so. Not my favorite, but good nonetheless. 8/10 <br /> <br />5. Angie - Some call it a classic. Some bash it as too sappy, poppy, or \\"70's-ish\\" to be a Stones song. I fall into the first category. Acoustic driven pop ballad with an instantly recognizable melody. One of Mick's greatest ballad vocal performances. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Silver Train - Nothing spectacular here, just the band having fun with a fast paced blues song. I guess I could compare it to 1972's 'All Down The Line' except it's not as good. Mick Taylor does play a mean slide on here though. Just a fun track. 7/10 <br /> <br />7. Hide Your Lover - Again, just sounds like the band having fun doing a bluesy tune. This one is piano based, but is still uptempo and again has some mean guitar brought to you by Mr. Taylor. 7/10 <br /> <br />8. Winter - Acknowledged as one of the bands classic ballads. However, I don't know that I agree with that. It's good, but not excellent. Just a midtempo pop ballad. I do, however, think that Mick Taylor's guitar solo brings this song to soaring heights. Had it not been included, I probably would have considered this tune to be filler. 7/10 <br /> <br />9. Can You Hear The Music - Probably the most experimental song on the whole album. Also one of the weakest. Kind of has this psychadelic pop feel to it. Midtempo but with a dominant guitar riff. However, not dominant like 'Brown Sugar' or 'Start Me Up', but dominant with the effect it has and it's volume. Especially when it first comes in. Another song with a lazy vibe to it. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />10. Star Star - Orignally titled 'Starf*cker', but had to be renamed upon release. This is a classic. Uptempo hard rocker with classic Mick vocals and a great sing along chorus (it's true). Ranks with the band's best. A must hear. If you only needed one reason to buy this album, this would be it. 10/10 <br /> <br />This isn't the band's best album, but it's one of them. As I've stated a few times throughout the review, the album does have a lazy vibe to it. It also has, at time, a drug hazed vibe to it. This was due to Keith Richard's strong heroin addiction. His presence isn't always felt on the album and you can tell. It DOES make a difference. But this is still a classic and one of my favorites.

B000005S5N|5.0|This is my favorite a-ha CD, and one of my favorites from my HUGE CD collection (I think I'm over 400 CD's now).  And, no, I don't collect the standard bubble-gum stuff from the likes of Britney Spears and other worthless, talentless wannabes - the music in my collection comes from solid talent, for the most part - a lot of rare, eclectic, and hard-to-find music.  So, for me to make the claim that this CD ranks as one of my favorites is quite a feat on a-ha's part!<br /><br />With that said, there are many reasons I just love this CD.  I fell in love with the song \\"October\\" the very first time I heard it and still love it to this day.  \\"Scoundrel Days\\" is a fantastic, up-tempo song that kicks you in the gut after a quiet start.  I think that the CD flows easily and smoothly from song to song, and that this was one of those rare CD's that just fell together perfectly.  \\"Soft Rains of April\\" was the perfect last song for this CD, and it leaves you wanting more - I just want to shout, \\"Another song!  Another song!  Encore!\\"  So, what do I do?  I start the whole CD over again for another listen!  :-)  Yes, I can play this CD over and over and not tire of it.  If you're an a-ha fan and don't already have this one, you need to add it to YOUR collection TODAY, before it goes out of print (how unfortunate).
B000002U82|5.0|It is not my favorite Pink Floyd album. I don't really know where to begin with this one. It was the first Pink Floyd album I owned and since then I wanted them all. I listened to it all the time, it was like nothing I've ever heard before. I didn't even get into the band untill the late 90s. After this came Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall and the most recent gem I've wanted for the longest time the underated insane out there masterpiece Ummagumma. Many has been said about Dark Side it's crazy, some looneys on the grass talk trash about it, because they don't know music if it hit them in the face. Pink Floyd is music man. It's what inspired most of the bands that followed. Radiohead, Yes, Tool, Ween, Mercury Rev, pretty much anyhting alternative, you name it, Pink Floyd has had a huge impact in rock history if you like it or not. Dark Side is the best selling album of all time. It blew away the charts like no other album. Heres what I think track by track.<br /><br />1. Speak to Me/Breathe Gorgeous intro to a classic album 10+<br />2. On The Run  I'd say the biggest inspiration to good electronic/techno music 10<br />3. Time  Amazing song, best on the album 10++<br />4. The Great Gig In The Sky  Very cool, great vocals, unique song for its time. 10<br />5. Money  Huge song, but not one of my favorites, overplayed 9+<br />6. Us And Them  One of Floyds most overated songs, still good 9<br />7. Any Colour You Like Great instrumental 10<br />8. Brain Damage all the lunitics should love this brilliant song which leads into<br />9. Eclipse  Perfect ending! 10+ for them both.<br /><br />I love this album, but also check out Meddle, Animals, Wish You Were Here, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Obscurred by Clouds and for more obscure albums check out Atom Heart Mother and Ummagumma(beware this one is quite out there). Also check out The Wall, but they have more then just The Wall you know. Basically everything they did was great. Pink Floyd are the gods of obscure rock man.
B0000DJZ9T|4.0|I have never seen Coldplay live, but have enjoyed their previous albums. The DVD captures the excitement of a live concert from your own living room couch. Except for the circles of light that occasionally obscure a clear view of Chris Martin, the DVD made me want to see them in person. It is crisp, entertaining and shows off the talent of this band. I found the bonus CD which is also live was even better. Without having the distraction of the lighting, the bonus CD rocks. This is a worthwhile package that can serve as an initiation into the band's repetoire, and a collector's item for those who are familiar with the band.
1400032717|3.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is a story of an autistic teenager who is excellent with numbers and has a photographic memory but lacks communication skills. His view of the world is simple: if it is not true, it is a lie. If he doesn't know a person, he shouldn't talk to him or her. If it is yellow or brown, it can't be touched. And nobody, not his father, not even his mother can touch him. <br /> <br />Mark Haddon's first book puts him in the league with great authors of our time. The book is so well written and the story has been narrated in such convincing tone, that at times I had to make sure that Mark was not writing his autobiography! <br /> <br />When Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone finds a murdered dog in his neighbors's frontyard, he picks him up instinctively. That is because he likes dogs. The neighbor assumes he killed the dog and from there start's Christopher's long and arduous journey to find the killer and unravel the mystery. However, in doing so, Christopher finds more than he had bargained for. His simple autistic mind cannot comprehend why anybody would kill a dog. While the answer, which he uncovers by the middle of the book, makes no sense, it does bring him face to face with the surprising truth about his dead mother and that ultimately convinces him to travel to London. Now begins the story of a boy, a child, who hasn't stepped beyond his street alone but travels boldly all the way to a metropolis where even adults with all their sense and knowledge of the world can get lost.  <br />Does he make it? What happens to the killer of the dog? What was the secret about his mother? The book links all questions rather beautifully but still fails to impress. <br />This is a very one dimensional book. The story didn't seem to be very original. We have all read books, watched plays or movies of handicapped children who undertake huge tasks and complete them.  <br />The book also fails to explore the relationship between Christopher and his mother even though his bond with his father has been explained well enough.  <br />The only charcters that are well developed are Christoper and his father. Readers get no insight into rest of the characters who could have very well defined the nature of relationship between Christopher and his parents. <br /> <br />CONCLUSION: Well written and moving but not entertaining. Very one dimensional. Read a few pages before you buy it.
006072448X|5.0|It is so rare to find a book that you can't put down but also one you don't want to end. Lionel Shriver has written one of the most introvertive, terrifying novels about a family doomed from the very start for tragedy, in exquisite prose and with everyday details that make us believers.  She still has me wondering if it really is a novel or her personal experience. She makes us laugh while we're afraid of what the humor relates to.  Early on her detailing of deciding on their son's name had me in hysterics, and these refreshing asides are dotted throughout. Although there are very subtle hints along the way they do nothing to solve the plot except to add excruciating suspense.  All through the reader knows something's afoot and although we know it's not anything that can be avoided, it is in the past, it's done, but what?, is the question that is answered so terrfiyingly not until the very end. The anxiety builds until the very end. Not often does a daily journal after the fact present such anticipation, which is more than fully satisfied.  Congratulations Ms. Shriver.  I am now ordering several more copies as this must be discussed and enjoyed among friends.
B000000OAN|5.0|If you were fortunate to be listening to this in the 70's as i was, this was such different music that was out there at the time. One of the great \\"party \\" albums of all time. Bohemian Rhapsody was and is still one of my favorites along with \\"You're my best friend\\" to this day! I turn up the volume on these ones!!
B00005JODA|1.0|While Ralph Finnes and Rachel Weisz are excellent actors, this film left me wondering how they managed to stay awake long enough to film their scenes. The plot of the movie was excellent, but that's about the end of it. The evil government and corporate operatives were so obvious as to be laughable. There was really no mystery here at all and the outcomes were predictable.<br /><br />My main beef was the glacial pace of the movie and the frentic camera work that made me want to put my popcorn down and grab some dramamine. At times, I found my eyes fluttering shut, as it was easier to just listen to the dialog rather than watch it.<br /><br />The main attraction of the movie was Africa itself and the occasional pauses in the film that let the beauty of the land and people shine through.<br /><br />If you must see it, be sure to load up on some coffee beforehand. Trust me, you'll need it.

B0000AUHQT|3.0|I won't reiterate what other reviewers have said in general about this picture; however, I feel compelled to write a few impressions.  I watched the movie shortly after reading Fitzgerald's novel for the first time, and, like others, was generally disappointed in the adaptation, notwithstanding its being almost completely faithful to the storyline of the book.    1. I was confused about the film's score's winning the Academy Award in 1974, since much of the DVD's score sounds like the left-over soundtrack of an old \\"Marcus Welby, MD\\" episode.  Based on some of the reviews here, however, it appears that the original Nelson Riddle score was replaced, possibly due to concerns about royalties or other intellectual-property issues.    2. Some of the casting can only be explained in the context of 1970s cinema, as it makes little sense now.  In 1974, Robert Redford was considered the quintessential dashing leading man, and Bruce Dern had a long history of playing the heavy, although usually in westerns.  I think someone must have seen something \\"period\\" in Mia Farrow, although I suspect that \\"something\\" tends to escape most viewers nowadays, in part because she looked too old for the role in 1974.  However, I agree with some reviewers that Sam Waterston as Nick, Scott Wilson as Wilson, and Lois Chiles as Jordan Baker, were inspired choices, and are rightly regarded as such even today.  Reasonable people may disagree, but I personally consider Karen Black as a great choice for Myrtle, but for a slight problem with her acting (see my next comment).    3. The biggest problem with the film is not the casting, per se, but rather the ACTING, for which I blame the director more than the actors themselves.  Given that Tom Buchanan is supposed to be from the midwest, one can forgive Bruce Dern for sounding and acting a little hick-ish, but I can't forget the fact that I'm watching Dern PLAYING Tom.  Farrow's performance as Daisy is also unconvincing; her simpering, cloying manneris enough to make me wonder (a) why someone doesn't break HER nose, and (b) why Gatsby doesn't simply say, upon making her re-acquaintance, \\"Oh, NOW I remember how you were--never mind the whole thing!\\"  Black's performance as Myrtle is too over-the-top--she well LOOKS the part, but she comes off as too unbalanced to attract anyone of Tom's economic stature.    4. The cinematography and editing leave a lot to be desired, as well.  The film simply has too much of a made-for-TV look and feel (and, mind you, a 1970s made-for-TV look and feel), which is only aggravated by the new-for-video score.    5. Notwithstanding all my criticisms, the costumes, sets, and art direction are sometimes stunning.  One good example is the ash-heap location of Wilson's garage and the all-seeing \\"Dr. Eckleburg\\" sign--as I read the book, I had trouble picturing the locale in my mind, but the film nails it.  Another image that the film gets right is the \\"green light across the bay\\" and everything that it symbolizes.  Finally, as one reviewer said, perhaps the West/East Egg mansions in the film look more Newport than \\"Lawn Guyland\\"; however, they do much to evoke the opulence and \\"carelessness\\" (i.e., the amorality and sense of privilege of the old-money rich) that Fitzgerald wished to convey in the novel.    It all adds up to a fairly mediocre film, but it still has its little charms.  For fans of the book, it bears one or two viewings, anyway.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This is a must have CD, if you've seen the movie or not....it has a wonderful array of genres and artists. The music is fantastic. I, actually, have a friend who asked me (when I was playing the CD in the car) if this was from the movie. She is a great fan of the movie and recognized the music immediately. We overplay this one!
B0000AKY7O|5.0|Some of the finest guitar music ever recorded.  Jazzy style.  Side men aren't too shabby either.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Being one of Christina's biggest fans, I had to have this album. I was expecting a good album, with some good vocals, but I had no idea how GREAT this album will be. First off, the songwriting on this is top notch. Christina as well as her team did a excellent job writing the music and lyrics for these songs. This album also gets very personal which I applaud Xtina for. She does an amazing job expressing her feelings and issues without the listener feeling bored w/ some singer's problems. The album has a real mature vibe, and it is a shame that the genre of an album is usually based on the artist rather than the album itself. We automatically think of Xtina as a \\"pop\\" girl, but she has a lot of good soul on this album, but it's put together in a clever, mainstream way. This album is amazing, go buy it!! <br /> <br />Stripped Intro- Xtina's introduction of this album. It's a nice intro and has a cool vibe 10/10 <br /> <br />Can't Hold Us Down- Basically it's about woman power. She's sending a message to the ladies to not let men bring us down. Features Lil' Kim  9/10 <br /> <br />Walk Away- Listen to this song and then tell me this girl doesn't have soul in her. LOVE this song  10/10 <br /> <br />Fighter- Nice, strong song sending a message to people who have hurt her in the past. She's a fighter!! I like the use of a lot of different instruments in this song to give it some edge. I could do w/o some of her yelling though. It kills my throat listening to it  8/10 <br /> <br />Primer Amor- This is in spanish, it's just her talking about her first love, puerto rican dancer w/ amazing brown eyes and blah blah. haha..gushy stuff. it's ok though  9/10 <br /> <br />Infatuation- This is the actual song about her first love. It has a nice latin vibe to it and her vocals are cool on this track  10/10 <br /> <br />Loves Embrace- An intro to the next song. It has a nice light, airy feel to it. When I first listened to it, I thought it sound a lot like Mariah Carey, and I thought she was just imitating her. But after listening to this album about 35,000 times, I don't think she's imitating, their voices just do similar things.  10/10 <br /> <br />Loving Me 4 Me- This is a really beautiful song. She uses sexy/sweet vocals on this track. It also has some soul in it. I love it.  10/10 <br /> <br />Impossible- Alicia Key's wrote this as well as the vocal arrangement for it. I'm not a big fan of her though. She does a lot of yelling and stuff that just does NOT sound write. So basically she has Christina do all the things that she does wrong w/ her voice on this song. But the song itself is great  10/10 <br /> <br />Underappreciated- Xtina singing about her relationship w/ a guy going sour. The relationship used to be great, now he doesn't pay attention to her. That sorta thing. Its an ok song but there's nothing too special about it. I still like it though  8/10 <br /> <br />Beautiful- Beautiful song, beautiful message  10/10 <br /> <br />Make Over- I like the message in this song. She's also doing an edgy, rock sound here. Its ok, but once again, I could do without the yelling  8/10 <br /> <br />Cruz- It's a nice song. But again, nothing too special in this one as with the other one  7/10 <br /> <br />Soar- Amazing vocals on this one  10/10 <br /> <br />Get Mine, Get Yours- Great vibe. She's talkin about being in \\"casual\\" relationships  10/10 <br /> <br />Dirrty- You saw the video.  10/10 <br /> <br />Stripped (Part Two)- \\"sorry if I ain't perfect..sorry I don't give a *what*\\"..doesn't get much better than that  10/10 <br /> <br />The Voice Within- This is another one w/ a great message. It's made me cry at times  10/10 <br /> <br />I'm OK- Poor Christina. Her singin about growin up w/ an abusive father. She crys a little on this track. It's amazing how vulnerable she allows herself to be  10/10 <br /> <br />Keep on Singin' My Song- I loove this song. Do your thing Xtina!! 10/10
B00005JODA|5.0|Based on a novel by John LaCarre, this film sensitively portrays and illuminates the skewed values of a global business and makes a moral and ethical judgement on the modern world. The clues are gradual, the build-up of suspense and espionage is very subtle. The pharmaceutical industry is revealed to care more about making billions of dollars than about the deadly side effects of the drug they are testing. Innocent people who are being treated for other illnesses sign consents under false pretext to test the drug \\"voluntarily\\". They are victims in many ways: betrayed by several governments, by healthcare workers, and by the pharmaceutical industry, which purports to be saving *their* lives ...<br /><br />Tessa, the idealistic humanitarian social activist young wife of Justin Quayle, the mild-mannered proper quiet British diplomat to Kenya, suspects and uncovers the unethical testing of a drug designed to irradicate an up-coming Tuberculosis (TB) epidemic, resistant to current drugs on the market. There is a seamless plot which includes complicated underpinnings of wrong-doing by various levels of society both African and British. Jason is unaware of his wife's discoveries until it is too late. As her Majesty's Diplomat to Kenya, he is portrayed as a quiet person, interested in gardening and a bit out of touch with some of the surrounding reality, above it all, although he is highly regarded with impeccable high standards. After his wife's death, he is jolted into action ... examining his wife's private papers and computer he unearths the covert activities in which she was involved. The depth of his loss and the strength of his love for Tessa opens his eyes ... he becomes a fugitive ... seeking the truth and eventually justice.<br /><br />There is superb cinematography ... a flock of wild geese flying in a V-like formation filmed from up above ... where the viewer sees the landscape below in its vast expanse of beauty. The viewer is given a glimpse into the over-crowded conditions of everyday life in Africa, small homes with corrogated rusting roofs ... as far as the eye can see. Fernando Meirelles, the producer, has superb casting, contrasting the dark beauty and extroverted personality of Rachel Weisz with the understated  striking blond good looks of Ralph Fiennes. The artistic filming techniques are used to maximum effect. The viewing of Tessa's body in the morgue by Justin, along with someone else in the Diplomatic Corps, who happens to have a physical reaction to seeing her charred body becomes symbolic of his responsibility and guilt. The joy of Tessa and Justin at her pregnancy is sensitively presented ... Justin's courage in fleeing the United Kingdom, without a passport, to discover what truths Tessa had uncovered which led to her death -- leads to his final act of love. This film is a classic which will long be remembered for its quiet strength and subtle ability to reveal deeply powerful penetrating truths. All 129 minutes of the film are worth viewing!

B000001FHV|5.0|Meat Puppets - Too High To Die (1994)<br /><br />I'm not trying to say it's better than II (commonly considered their best along with UOTS). Personal preferences sometimes have to do with, say, the great summer you had listening to a cool record, or maybe when one saved your sanity at a boring job. But I really do think TOO HIGH TO DIE is truly one of their best, and I even know a few Meat-heads who insist it is, in fact, their greatest.<br /><br />This kind of praise unfortunately gets thrown around a lot, but I must (type) that I think Curt Kirkwood is a highly underrated guitar genius. His playing is pretty unique, super-melodic and he's technically gifted. The Kirkwood brothers' voices (\\"Cris\\" on bass) are less so. They tend to sing in the same basic range here, but they actually SING (no screaming, posturing, etc.) and do it well - I dig their voices!<br /><br />This album rocks, but there's also a lot of variety. There's quite a bit of country influence and it's ironic that I love it so much cuz I'm no country fan. I didn't go for a lot of this album at first, but now some of those songs I didn't go for initially get stuck in my head - and I like that! The following notes are my personal impressions of TOO HIGH TO DIE:<br /><br />\\"Violet Eyes\\" - kicks it off with a killer, the hardest rocker on the record. Awesome feedback-laden soloing from Curt - trippy!<br /><br />\\"Never To Be Found\\" - catchy and tuneful, this groover is addictive. The bass is simple and perfect. It starts off lighter than \\"Violet Eyes\\" with some crisp strumming, but takes off to great heights. \\"We got road, we got time, so we're out of here . . .\\" Love the epic guitar coda at the end before the band kicks in again with a faster tempo.<br /><br />\\"We Don't Exist\\" - cool rocker. I'm not sure why the singer wants and needs \\"Cayenne\\" so bad or what it will do for him, but his longing for it is powerful. Or maybe Cayenne's just a girl.<br /><br />\\"Severed Goddess Hand\\" - Sweet and easy-going rocker with cool vocal harmonies.<br /><br />\\"Flaming Heart\\" - drummer Derrick Bostrom gradually and skillfully increases the tempo over the course of this song with the effect of intensifying it (contrary to some opinions, that's a compliment). This is one of the songs that sometimes just pops in my head and starts playing - the part towards the end where the lead guitar kicks in.<br /><br />\\"Shine\\" - unlike the other songs here, this one is really mellow and beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Station\\" - This track sounds like a demented country circus. I couldn't deal with it when I first heard this album. Now I'm addicted to it.<br /><br />\\"Roof With a Hole\\" - a loooow down, powerful, blues-y #. \\"There may be diamonds in that dream on the hill/ But the people who live there still complain/ Cause the roof's got a hole in it/ And everything's been ruined by the rain.\\" (Listening to this song today struck me as poignant in the wake of Hurricane Katrina's devestation.)<br /><br />\\"Backwater\\" - a great song and pretty much their lone hit on alt-rock radio. I don't think it's necessarily the best on the album, but it's certainly a strong contender and it did sound great on the radio. Killer rhythm!<br /><br />\\"Things\\" - another great one (I'd rate every song on TOO HIGH TO DIE a 5) with some truly wild and strange guitar moves from Curt.<br /><br />\\"Why?\\" - a gorgeous, folky little tune.<br /><br />\\"Evil Love\\" - Another excellent rock groove.<br /><br />\\"Comin Down\\" - great, bouncy tune and (more or less) a straight-up country track.<br /><br />bonus hidden track - a deadpan, super-cool re-recording of their classic \\"Lake of Fire.\\" Doesn't surplant the original, but it's way cool and Curt solos his ass off.cker with cool vocal harmonies.<br /><br />\\"Flaming Heart\\" - drummer Derrick Bostrom gradually and skillfully increases the tempo over the course of this song with the effect of intensifying it (contrary to some opinions, that's a compliment). This is one of the songs that sometimes just pops in my head and starts playing - the part towards the end where the lead guitar kicks in.<br /><br />\\"Shine\\" - unlike the other songs here, this one is really mellow and beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Station\\" - This track sounds like a demented country circus.

0393307050|2.0|With all the hype I expected better.  I have to agree with other reviewers that the sea jargon weighs down the writing, and the plot and characterization could have been better.  I admired the author's knowledge of 18th century seafaring, but on the whole I was left dissapointed.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is the definitive movie version of \\"Peter Pan!\\" Forget the animated Disney cartoon filled with a bunch of cheesy songs and the annoying Cathy Rigby adaptation based on the stage musical...this film stays true to J.M. Barrie's classic story and features outstanding special effects that create the most amazing Neverland you can possibly imagine. Add to that a magnificent cast of the most adorable children on the planet along with Jason Isaacs (perhaps best known for his role as Lucius Malfoy in the \\"Harry Potter\\" movies) in a duel role as the delightfully evil Captain Hook and the slightly neurotic Mr. Darling, and you have one of the most fantastic fairytale productions ever made! \\"Peter Pan\\" is full of fun and sorrow, adventures and tears...it's a story that will enchant both children and adults. Don't miss this one!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is only the second time I have taken time to review a product here, this series is that good.  Well developed charachters, witty dialogue, good sets and many unexpected twists.  This is not a show of epic battles but stories of a crew trying to survive within and outside the law.  The stories are good if for no other reason then you do not know how things will turn out.  By no means is it always the typical hollywood plot where the good guys always come out on top or your hero always does the right thing.  If a little bit of western flare doesent hurt your sci fi experience you are doing yourself a disservice passing this up.

B000069AUI|5.0|Like it or not, coldplay is one band that wouldn't disappear anytime soon.  Not if they churn out such great albums such as \\"Parachutes\\" \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" and \\"X&Y\\".  Coldplay is one of the few bands that only get better in time, sort of like fine wine.  However, this isn't just fan-boy talk, Coldplay's sophmore album has reason to celebrate.  It avoids many typical pitfalls of bad albums.<br />Each song is fresh and different.  Clocks, surely the most famous song on the album, is one of the best songs of the album.  Don't like Clocks?  Listen to A Rush of Blood to the Head, if you don't like them both, don't worry there are 9 other songs, that are different enough to be fresh, but not so different that it sounds strange.  Coldplay's \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\"  is definitely the perfect balance between experiments and following an already proven formula.

I do not understand the hate for it because it si such a lovely piece of work that i dont see how anyone can hate it???????? <br />why do people need to make it sound so horrible, i think it is because they want to look clever and they probably havent even seen the movie anyway. <br />Patrick swayze is to die for and jennifer grey just looks so cute in her hotpants and she can really act too! <br />the movie covers so many different topics of every teenagers life that you can really relate to baby, and what she goes through. I cried atthe end when everything was all ok because the movie was so well done and really got into my blood. If you didn't like this its because you didnt get it and you must not understand movies then????? <br />go rent or buy this now as i higly recomend it.
B0000025HG|5.0|From the opening lyrics of the album's title cut, Barbra sings \\"Wet is rain, rain is clean and new\\" to the closing lyrics of the closing track \\"Kiss Me In The Rain,\\" Barbra sings \\"I don't even mind if I get wet,\\" and all of the songs in between, Barbra clearly has her first aquatic-themed album. Is this an unusual theme? Yes. Most artists have themed albums such as songbooks made famous by other artists, or a mix of ethnic material that other singers have made so popular in the past, but not our Barbra. Barbra stands alone. Her unique voice has found a unique theme and the results are saturated with her glorious voice.<br /><br />When this album arrived in the fall of 1979, Barbra already had so many fine accomplishments; it's no wonder that her vocal was so confident. She was still riding high on the success of her newly found home, radio, and her singles, which hardly moved in the previous decade, were now flying off the shelves and becoming favorites of a new audience - teenagers! From the time she delivered her first album 16 years prior, she was THE premier female vocalist.<br /><br />\\"Wet\\" is an interesting mix of songs that range from lush ballads, such as the aforementioned title cut which Streisand co-wrote, to pop to rock and disco. This album covered each musical genre flawlessly. Not just because of Streisand's impeccable voice, but because the song choices and arrangements were top-notch.<br /><br />Following \\"Wet,\\" Barbra took on the Harold Arlen-Johnny Mercer standard \\"Come Rain Or Come Shine\\" with a jazz-oriented arrangement and an electric guitar, and brought the gorgeous ballad that was written decades before and gave it a sound that was \\"clean and new.\\" The arrangement and vocal is one of the best versions of this song I have ever heard. It is still my favorite, and this song has been covered by the best. Judy, Frank and Ella's are the most familiar.<br /><br />Other lush ballads include \\"On Rainy Afternoons\\" and \\"After The Rain\\" both written by the ever-present Bergmans, with Lalo Schifrin and Michel Legrand composing the music on each of the songs, respectively. The placing of the two songs back-to-back is also a stroke of genius, the two songs act as companion pieces to close out side 1 of the album. The piano on \\"On Rainy Afternoons\\" is reminiscent of the piano solo of \\"Nadia's Theme\\" that was written a few years before and adds the delicate quality to Barbra's polished delivery.<br /><br />My favorite ballad on the album, hands-down, is the Marvin Hamlisch, Carol Bayer-Sager, Bruce Roberts collaboration of \\"Niagara.\\" This song has Streisand in her most dramatic, yearning for a love that is faltering all too fast. Streisand sings of her disdain of the present and longs for the time the couple was care-free and beautiful and \\"crazy\\" living out their fantasies on a vacation in Niagara Falls. She longs to be \\"crazy\\" again. The sax solo by veteran Tom Scott is magic and adds fire and emotion to compliment Streisand's outstanding vocal.<br /><br />For a nice balance to the ballads, the Bobby Darin pop rocker \\"Splish Splash\\" was added to the roster with additional lyrics by Streisand herself. The song and its choice was the only song on the album that the critics found flaws with. But then again, they have always found flaws when Barbra attempted anything rock-oriented. I have to disagree with the critics on this. The arrangement of this song by David Foster was meant to be delivered as a party song, serving up nothing but fun, and fun is what we got. Tom Scott and his sax are key to giving this song that extra oomph. How many rock songs can you name where you can understand all of the lyrics? Even Streisand's delivery is perfection. Some say she went overboard with a minute or so of uncontrollable laughter that close out the song. I say she added the spirit in which the song was intended. \\"It's gettin' hot.\\" Party on!<br /><br />The big single release of the album was the highly-touted duet with none other than the queen of disco herself, Donna Summer. Barbra had to actually be talked into including this jewel on the album because it originally didn't contain lyrics that included water. The original title of this song by Paul (Last Dance, The Main Event) Jabara and Bruce Roberts was \\"Enough Is Enough.\\" The trio went back and within days returned with a gorgeous opening ballad that contained the lyrics \\"It's raining, it's pouring\\" and throughout the most demanding disco beat, Streisand sang, and adapted \\"No More Tears\\" as the dueling divas belted their lousy lovers out the door and declared their state of independence. Thus, the name of the song was renamed \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\\" and was MORE than good enough to be included on the album. It was so good, the 8 minute plus version, and not the edit, was included on the album. When the album was first delivered to retail, it included a sticker of the famous Francesco Scavullo photo of Barbra and Donna \\"Featuring the hit single\\" slapped right on the cover. No doubt, Barbra had a successful foray into disco (\\"The Main Event/Fight\\") just a few months prior, but this duet just exploded and went to Number 1 within weeks of its release. It was also the first \\"12\\" club single to reach platinum status. Streisand, being a woman of \\"firsts\\" added this to her long list.<br /><br />The album's two closing numbers are a fluffy disco-tinged number \\"I Ain't Gonna Cry Tonight\\" and the second single to be released, the ballad \\"Kiss Me In The Rain.\\" While I found the lyrics to be sentimental and sometimes a bit silly on \\"Kiss Me In The Rain,\\" Streisand's refined opening to her powerhouse vocal and back to graceful closing made the song work. How many times have you heard people say, she could sing the phonebook and make it important? That was my feeling, more or less, with the final track.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Wet\\" is one of the finest pop albums in Barbra Streisand's catalogue. The orchestrations are lush, the songs are fun, and the vocal is superb. Were you expecting anything less from the world's greatest pop singer? \\"Wet\\" still stands as one of my all-time favorite Streisand recordings.

B0009R1T7M|3.0|This is one of those records that come around once every couple of years where the story and hype surrounding the artist absolutely overshadows the actual music. When you mix in the ingredients of a unique concept, cheerleader press photos, christianity, and serial killers people will listen. While he crafts interesting and sometimes fascinating subject matter, buried inside are mostly forgetable tunes. Lackluster melodies and predictable progressions haunt the lion's share of this record. Sufjan could benefit from a listen or two of BC Camplight or Burt Bacharach to tweak his \\"pop\\" sensibilities. Then he'd be invincible.

Please if you don't know what to say you better shut up. This Cd is unique and magnifique!!! Martha was so young and fresh in this Cd and she goes her own way, and that is what made her famous all over the world. So trust me, millions around the globe can't be wrong. This Cd really does worth every dollar you spend!!!!!

B0009XT8YW|5.0|On September 23, 1980, Barbra Streisand released Guilty, the most successful and arguably the most satisfying pop album of her long and legendary recording career. The album spawned three top ten singles; the first release, \\"Woman In Love,\\" topped the pop charts for three weeks in October 1980, the second and third singles were smash duets with collaborator Barry Gibb, the infectious mid-tempo \\"Guilty\\" and the power ballad \\"What Kind of Fool.\\" The fact that this celebrated duo teamed up and made history is almost as interesting as the music he wrote and produced and the songs she performed. Upon its initial release in 1980, \\"Guilty\\" was quickly certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, and, within two months, achieved Platinum status. It has gone on to be certified 5x's Platinum, with sales exceeding 5,000,000 copies in the U.S. alone and 12 million worldwide.  It is one of Streisand's record-breaking tally of 49 Gold, 30 Platinum and 13 Multi-Platinum albums.  According to the RIAA, she is the industry's #1 best selling female recording artist...and the only female in the top ten.<br /><br />On August 30, 2005, 25 years later, Guilty was re-released not only in LPCM format, but also as a Dual Disc. Side One contains the original songs dusted off and tweaked so meticulously, you'll hear notes and instruments that you've never heard before. Side Two is the real treat. It's a DVD that consists of a brand new interview with Barbra and Barry on the recording of Guilty - taped June 2005, two live performances, \\"Guilty\\" and \\"What Kind Of Fool\\" from Barbra's legendary 1986 \\"One Voice\\" concert at her Malibu home, an excerpt \\"Stranger In A Strange Land,\\" one of the eleven new songs from her upcoming September 20 release, titled Guilty Pleasures, a preview of the new album and a Photo Gallery of the sessions with Gibb.<br /><br />The reason for all of this fanfare is of course to promote the most anticipated album of the upcoming fall music season. Before I jump ahead to her upcoming release, \\"Guilty Pleasures,\\" let's go back to where it all began.<br /><br />By the late 70's, the Bee Gees were the hottest act around, coming off of Saturday Night Fever and six consecutive Number One singles. Meanwhile, Streisand had become the ultimate pop princess-- scoring a dozen Top 40 hits in the decade, including four Number One's which included \\"The Way We Were,\\" \\"Love Theme From A Star Is Born (Evergreen)\\" (both winning Grammy's and Best Song Oscars), and two historic duets, \\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\" with Neil Diamond and \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\\" with Donna Summer.<br /><br />In August 1980, the first single, \\"Woman in Love\\" written by Barry & Robin Gibb, was released to radio and began a swift rise to the top of the charts. The song was like nothing that Barbra had ever attempted in her then 18-year recording career. The hooks were pure Bee Gees magic and the backup vocals were gorgeously ethereal. It was one of the best pop songs of Streisand's career. With the mounting success of the single, the anticipation for the album rapidly increased. Five weeks later, the suspense was terminated. Within three weeks after the release, Streisand owned the top of Billboard Hot 100 and Album charts with \\"Woman in Love\\" and Guilty, respectively.<br /><br />The title cut kicked off the album, which was a mid-tempo duet with Gibb. It was an absolute joy to hear Barbra using her voice in such a playful way. She and Barry complimented each other beautifully, as they did on the album's only other duet, the power ballad \\"What Kind of Fool.\\"<br /><br />Another highlight on the album was \\"The Love Inside,\\" which is a lavish song of lost love. Barbra's unique brand of quiet longing married to the lush arrangement makes this one of the finest in her repertoire, and proves that nobody can break your heart and sell a song like Streisand.<br /><br />\\"Promises\\" is the closest that the Gibb Brothers came to delivering a disco song whendisco was already on its way out. The song smartly used Gibb's dance element but slowed it down just enough to make it a mid-tempo romp with Streisand easily gliding in and out of the melodious hooks.<br /><br />For those of you who prefer a more traditional ballad, \\"Run Wild\\" proved to be right up Streisand's alley for the familiar sound most people associate her with.<br /><br />\\"Life Story\\" is a song that could have easily been used as a James Bond theme song. Nobody knows their way around dramatic chord changes like Barry Gibb, and this song is no exception. Streisand's flair for the dramatic intensified the atmosphere even more.<br /><br />\\"Never Give Up\\" was also a departure for Streisand. This is the first song where the synthesizer actually complimented the songbird's voice -- and when you thought it was all studio trickery, the bridge came and Streisand sang it with all of her Broadway bravado.<br /><br />The final track \\"Make It Like A Memory\\" is the most dramatic of the nine-song set. The sonata combines Streisand the actress with Streisand the singer, and what we get is close to a three act play with a jaw-dropping vocal and a wild guitar solo. Streisand coos at one moment and is belting the next with so much raw emotion, she literally takes you on a seven and a half minute roller coaster ride.<br /><br />Guilty is the most unique album of Streisand's pop catalogue, and it's easily apparent why it was Number One in over a dozen countries and sold over twelve million units worldwide. The ingredients that Gibb cooked up for this album are so delicious that even non-Streisand fans ate it up.<br /><br />For those who haven't heard this historic opus, I highly suggest picking up a copy of the newly remastered Dual Disc- it is absolutely phenomenal. The album may be titled Guilty, but the pleasure is anything but.ed Gibb's dance element but slowed it down just enough to make it a mid-tempo romp with Streisand easily gliding in and out of the melodious hooks.

This thing barely deserves my trash talking.
B000062YAZ|5.0|There are some albums that you find yourself really enjoying at first, but then become tiresome after but a few listens. There are other albums that you might not particularly like at first, but come to appreciate only after several subsequent listens. However, there are some albums that grab you right from the start and that you simply never tire of. This is one of those albums. <br /> <br />Previous Slayer albums Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits may have suffered from poor production which held them back from being as brutal as they should have been, but for Reign in Blood, the production was dead-on and is still unmatched today. Despite being released in 1986, Reign in Blood has lost none of its speed and brutality, even by modern standards. The album is relatively short, around 30 minutes, but Slayer accomplished more in half an hour than most bands today could accomplish in an entire discography. That doesn't mean that the album has only half a disc's worth of material; rather, it's like a full album compressed by half. <br /> <br />No song on this album is less than 120 BPM, but despite the often ridiculous tempo, Slayer never loses sight of musicality. If you listen closely to each song, you can hear a distinct hook and melody in every one. Anyone can thrash wildy on a guitar really fast, but Slayer are one of the few bands that can actually PLAY their guitars at such high speeds. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman both alternate between lead and rhythm, each providing guitar solos one right after the other. Drummer Dave Lombardo is also worthy of praise, beating his kit into submission with astonishing precision and creativity despite the rampaging tempos. Tom Araya shouts and screams his way through lyrics detailing such things as sadistic Nazi scientist Joseph Mengele, serial killers, cannibalism, as well as a dose of the usual death/hell/Satan. Again, despite the fast tempos and having to cram so many syllables into such a small period of time, Araya manages to remain (barely) comprehensible. <br /> <br />Song Summaries: <br /> <br />1. Angel of Death - Perhaps the most infamous song in thrash history, with lyrics about Joseph Mengele (AKA the Angel of Death) that of course whipped up a fair amount of controversy. Riffs tailor-made for headbanging abound, as well as a spastic solo from King, mimicking human screams with his guitar. A fantastic opener. A+ <br />2. Piece by Piece - Two minute long bit of thrash that's only a hint of what's to come. Typical king lyrics, \\"...no emotion, death is all I see.\\" B+ <br />3. Necrophobic - If you thought the first two tracks were fast, wait until you catch an earful of this! At approximately 1:40 in length, it's probably the fastest track on the album. Warning: attempting to play guitar or drums at this speed may cause your arms to fall off. A+ <br />4. Altar of Sacrifice - What's Slayer without some Satanic references? \\"Enter into the realm of Satan!\\" Araya chants, and I crack a huge grin. Absolutely fantastic guitar-wise. A+ <br />5. Jesus Saves - In addition to Satanic references, what Slayer album would be complete without some Christian-bashing? (which I am 100% okay with?) Begins with a deceptively slow intro, then turns into another burst of speed, almost as fast as Necrophobic. A+ <br />6. Criminally Insane - Another burst of speed, with more crazed lyrics to boot. Typical of the album: furious shredding, wild solos, and brutal, precise drumming. A- <br />7. Reborn - Yet another fast song (sensing a pattern here?) with Araya cramming a substantial amount of words into a very short time frame. \\"I will be REBORN!\\" A+ <br />8. Epidemic - Nonsensical lyrics from King; perhaps the weakest track on the album, but still a great piece of musicianship. B+ <br />9. Postmortem - The slowest track on the album, but no less brutal. Absolutely furious drumming from Lombardo here, with the great line \\"do you want to die!?\\" shouted by Araya. Of course, it's just a build up the final track... A- <br />10: Raining Blood - Slayer saves the best for last. The climax of the album is suitably furious and brutal, and an absolute perfect closer to the album. Be sure to check out Tori Amos' cover of this song for an totally different take on it. A+ <br /> <br />Reign of Blood is deservedly hailed as a thrash classic, and at $9.99 it's an absolute steal. Any metal fan should have this in their collection. Give this a listen and hear one of the Big Four at their peak.
B00006J3WH|5.0|If you loved the show.  This CD is a must.  The soundtrack from one of the most inginious episodes ever.  I'm very glad Joss decided to do this episode.  It was a dream of his for some time, and now it is one of my (and many of my friends) favorite episodes. <br /> <br />As you may guess, the singers are really the actors/actresses from the show.  None of them are really professional singers (except Anthony Stewart Head I suppose... who really put out an alblum) but it is all very well done.  Both James Marsters and Amber Benson have surprisingly good singing voices.  And the rest of the cast does great too.  <br /> <br />My favorite song on the CD still has to be \\"Walk through the Fire\\" which has all the main characters sing at some point.  Very well done.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi follows a rather rote survival plot.  As the hero, Pi Patel is stranded on a boat with a ferocious tiger and forced to endure the elements in a series of episodic encounters, the monotonous conventionality of the plot begs the question: is this really what the novel's about?  Well, no.  The survivalist plot is, in actuality, just a construction on which Yann Martel pours his spiritual and philosophical ideas.  The problem is that if you're naive like me, you won't realize that until Martel spells it out to you in the last third chapter of the book.  By that time, you've wasted 2/3rds reading a book without understanding the inherent artificiality of it's construction.  At any rate, Martel seems to say a lot: about the link between humans and animals, the ability of the animus to withstand tragedy, the simultaneous triumph of spirituality and indictment of literal, objective truth.  Life of Pi is worth a second read to pour into the symbols better and uncover the secrets that were disguised under its episodic surface.

1590581814|5.0|Readers who delight in noir have a treat in store. <br /> <br />This short novel moves back and forth in both time and place, following a few weeks in the life of Driver - a character who provides no other name.  He has a double career - first as a stunt driver for the LA film industry, self trained and among the best in the highly skilled group of specialists.  And in the evenings and between film jobs he drives for thieves and con men.  But that is all he does - drive.  No burglary, no guns, no other participation.   <br /> <br />A moonlighting venture goes wrong and sends Driver in search of those who double crossed him.  In spare prose, important people in Driver's past and present life are clearly drawn and  believable, some presented only as traces from  Driver's memory.  Although fragmentary, these brief references provide perfect motivation for Driver's actions as he moves toward his moments of revenge.  He is a man not always on the right side of the law, or even of a just society, yet in Sallis' hands he becomes a man worthy of respect.

For me, CD#2 is better than CD#1, as it concentrates on the less well-known material.<br /><br />But why does Gabriel use this enhanced CD to encourage us to go to the wretched 'Noodle' site. I have wasted a good hour of my life trying to get this software to work, and I still have very little idea what it is going to do for me. I feel utterly depressed by the experience, when I was hoping to feel uplifted.<br /><br />So five out of five for the music selection, but several hundred minus points for the Web content.
0930289528|5.0|It is a testament to our times that a graphic novel put together piece by piece in the 80's in Britain finds such a resounding echo in 21st Century America. It has always been a human proclivity to sacrifice freedoms for security in times of uncertainty but Franklin was right that \\"those who woud sacrifice freedom for security deserve neither,\\" and this is part of the philosphy that drives our V in \\"V for Vendetta.\\" It is interesting that many Britains today don't do much with Guy Falkes day and that Britain has been secure enough in the past decades that many in the current generations forget the type of sacrifices that their grandparents or great-grandparents went through to help defeat fascism. But Britain (and by proxy America) gained its stability by and sense of democracy through centuries of strife and bloodshed to bring about the freedoms that we cherish today. \\"V for Vendetta\\" reminds us that the old and trite truism that \\"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter,\\" still has some bite even in a post-9/11 world and that one of the prices we pay for freedom is to constantly question our governments, the intent of our leaders, and our place in such a world... agree or disagree with V's methods, at least the graphic novel has the strength to make you think and ask, \\" What would you do?\\"
B00005JNTX|2.0|Rule #1  Children do not belong in film noir.   While most classic black & white film noirs are about a single man in a big city or country-side mixed up in something they can't get out of, this modern film noir tries something different.   It's black & white, but uses the green screen for computer-generated locations to give it that comic book look.  As with the films [[ASIN:B0009R1TI6 Rumble Fish (Special Edition)]](1983), [[ASIN:B00012QM8G Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)]] (1993) and [[ASIN:6305308659 Pleasantville (New Line Platinum Series)]] (1998), their is a a splash of color from time to time, mostly blood red in this one.   This film is based on Frank Miller's adult graphic novels so this film is not for children to see.  Contains violence and nudity.  Bruce Willis begins the film as &#34;Hartigan&#34;.   Mickey Rourke returns to the silver screen.  In real-life, Micky Rourke's face was disfigured by his time of boxing after he quit acting.  His face has since been reconstructed and the muscles are really his.  Rourke did wear some rubber make-up in the film.   Clive Owen looks the &#34;Bond&#34; type in this role minus tuxedo.   Benicio Del Toro's face and body has filled out since his days of [[ASIN:B000M53GMW Licence To Kill]] (1989).  In Sin City, he plays &#34;Jackie Boy&#34;.   Elijah Wood shows off his karate moves.  Powers Booth plays &#34;Senator Roark&#34;.  Rutger Hauer (Blade Runner [1982]) is &#34;Cardinal Roark&#34;  Josh Hartnett (Halloween H2O [1998]) also makes a couple appearances.   Michael Madsen who we have seen in [[ASIN:B001EDVNNU Die Another Day]] (2002) plays &#34;Bob&#34; in Sin City.  Sequel:  Sin City: A Dame To Kill For (2014).

My 3 month old will actually sit on my lap through most or all of the book.  Later, it will be a good book to help him learn, because it has short and simple sentences.

B000002W9P|5.0|I first heard of Helloween during their \\"Headbanger's Ball\\" tour in 1988 or so. Later, I saw this album, and picked it up, on name recognition alone.<br /><br />That was the single most life-altering music purchase I ever made. It has influenced my musical tastes ever since.<br /><br />Helloween's epic \\"Keeper of the Seven Keys, Part I\\" is a joy to listen to. From the opening (synth) horns on the intro \\"Initiation\\", to the final soulful wails of a (completely) solo guitar on \\"Follow the Sign\\", this album delivers in spades.<br /><br />Of the rest of the album, all the songs are great. I agree with one reviewer saying that \\"Twilight of the Gods\\" (track 4) is the weakest, but this is in no way a condemnation of that song. Rather, consider it a ruby in a fistful of diamonds.<br /><br />I find myself singing along with each and every one of these songs. The tunes are catchy, the guitars have just the right amount of crunch, the vocals soar.<br /><br />When you read the lyrics, some of the songs begin to have a much deeper meaning than before. Some people call the lyrics cheesy, but I say that the lyrics have a fantasy slant to them. For example, on the surface, \\"Halloween\\" is about the things that happen on Halloween. Yet, once the stage is set, you come to the main character's confrontation with \\"the evil one\\" as he implores an unnamed power to \\"give me the stength to carry on\\" so that he \\"will fight for all mankind; humanity and peace of mind.\\" This basically serves as a lead for their next album, \\"Keeper of the Seven Keys, Part II\\".<br /><br />I cannot recommend this enough.  Personally, I got this album in early 1989 on cassette (converted to CD in 1995), and it has been a regular on my \\"turntable\\" ever since -- literally.

0800127862|5.0|Ok this movie is great if you're an Arnie fan...ARNIE FANS ONLY, no half assin here. But Beware the PAN AND SCAN STANDARD VERSION of the film, its a horrible transfer. I was lucky enough to find this film in widescreen...I repeat only buy the widescreen version the standard one is in pan and scan.
B000244FDW|4.0|If you cannot stop reading the book, buy both the A&E and BBC versions.  Because, like myself, you obviously can't get enough.  Both are entertaining enough and different enough from each other to justify the expense.  Double your pleasure.<br /><br />C.P. of Atlanta
B00008GKEG|5.0|The Anthology DVD is worth the price of admission for the bonus tracks alone. Finally, you get to witness the remaining Beatles get back together and record songs after 25 years of putting their fans through musical hell as a result of their collective absence.  I kept talking to the television and saying, \\"See, fellas, it wasn't that hard afterall.  You don't have to stop with two of John's old songs.  Keep going!!!!\\" But alas, it didn't happen, and now all we have is history.  Popular music, for the most part, has been so rotten for the past three decades, perhaps younger bands can use the \\"Free as a Bird/Real Love\\" sessions  to witness how to create harmony parts, middle bits and guitar rifts that actually fit and compliment the song.  To get an idea of where \\"Real Love\\" started out, buy Lennon's Acoustic CD as well to hear the roughed-out version. <br /> <br />
B00000DFSK|5.0|An amazing collection of songs from my favourite band ever.  They RULE!  The best of the 1980's and the best EVER, they are unchallenged, unstoppable, and unstable!  The magic is at work with 'Pride', 'With or Without You' and 'Desire' and all the rest too, those are just my favourite's.  <br /> <br />If you haven't heard any of these songs yet you are missing out on a part of your life. So go out and hear them. Now.  That's pretty much all there is to be said!

B000784WMW|5.0|A friend from Russia introduced this film to me by her desire to have a copy at any cost.  She had seen this as a miniseries in Russia but missed a few episodes.  I hurriedly read the book while waiting for her to let me borrow it.  I have since read the book several times and seen several versions on film.  This is the best.  The story came alive in these actors.  I even checked the book to see if some wonderfully illuminating scenes were added.  They were not.  They played them faithfully as if Charlotte Bronte had written the screenplay.  Incidentally, the worst film version had William Hurt in it.  The whole thing was butchered with the best scenes and dialog completely removed.  I nearly walked out of the theatre.  The elderly crowd could be heard muttering their shocked disapproval as we left.<br /><br />  This is the ONE.  Nothing made before or since can touch it.
0345440900|1.0|I'm usually the sort who thinks if you can't find something positive to say, keep your mouth shut.  However, this book and the DVD that I purchased have inspired me to write. Simply put it is indescribably bad.  Made me feel a bit ashamed to be British.  There's no research behind anything she says and it is repetitive beyond imagination.  What were they thinking?  I'm glad its made her rich but there are so many better books out there especially if you want to hear advice that is based more on research than one woman's hunch.  Eg I loved the DVD of the Happies Baby on the Block.  It gave me more than just reading the book as I could observe how to do the swaddling and rocking techniques. <br />Save your pennies for something better than this drivel!
B000001FS3|5.0|This is possibly the greatest album from the greatest band.  I love U2 more than word's can describe, and there is something about them that makes them so inspiring, beautiful, unique and downright fascinating they are impossible to resist.  Their style is the strongest of strong and remain the only band to be on par with Zepplin.  <br /> <br />This album itself is full of songs so courageous and breaktaking in their scope, that you simply can't help being swept up in it all.  The deep pitch of Bono's voice can't really be explained; you just have to hear it, and it is particulary evident in 'With or Without You' (a personal favourite).  The songs are so many and so good, I can't really go through them all, but you'd know when you heard them. This also contains what I feel is U2's most underrated song - 'In God's Country'.  I know the song is quite well known, but listening again to the beautiful lyrics and beckoning melody, I realise what little praise this has recieved when it deserves much.  U2's music is like beautiful poetry - it makes me feel good inside.  Again, Bono's voice on 'With or Without You' has often been used to calm me down in moments of momentary breakdown.  And it works.  <br /> <br />I don't think this review has given U2 nearly all the credit they deserve, but there is one more thing: I once had to write something for somewhere saying who my childhood hero was... and I put 'Bono'.
B000002ARV|5.0|In my opinion this is by far the very best album Johnny Winter ever recorded ! It remains timeless and sounds every bit as good today as it did in the 70's ! It takes you from the hardest of rock to the most mellow ballad over to the blues and back to his country side. If I was ever stranded on a desert island this would be a must have for me ! The guitar work is amazing !
B00068NVI4|3.0|Like most Yes fans, I waited for the release of this DVD and was somewhat annoyed when it was delayed. I think many of the reviewers have captured both the negative and positive aspects of this release, the primary one being the audio. I have seen Yes live at least ten times since 1972 and of course was present at the 35th anniversary tour when it landed at the Office Depot Center in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. That was the performance that probably should have been filmed because it was extraordinary. But as far as a live sound, most of the people I talked to agreed that it should have been much louder. I don't know if this correlates wuth the mix on this DVD, but I agree with the other reviewers that the drum mix is too low and the vocal mix too high. Compare it to \\"Yes Symphonic Live\\" and \\"House of Yes\\" and you'll see what I'm talking about. And Howe was having an off night compared to the other live DVD's and concerts I've seen. Still, I loved the concert and this disk definately contains some gems that most Yes fans will find hard to resist. The acoustic set is worth the price of admission and there are some other excellent performances. Wakeman is superb and he truly shines on this DVD. A group like this should have had a much better sound system for their 35th Anniversary tour and had someone compentent mixing the DVD audio. Eddie Offord where are you? All that said, I still find this concert quite enjoyable but if you planned on buying just one live Yes DVD, this shouldn't be it. However, I think most Yes fans will want to add it to their collections.
0385512058|5.0|\\"Never Eat Alone\\" gives some excellent advice regarding developing relationships.  Ferrazzi starts off by stating you really need to begin by finding your own passion and mission.  Additionally, to build strong relationships you need to ask, \\"What can I offer?\\" rather than \\"What can I get?\\"<br /><br />Ferrazzi has an excellent writing style that is easy to understand and read.  He gives some great suggestions regarding how to \\"ping\\" casual contacts and keeping in touch with people.  Ferrazzi is a \\"follow up\\" maniac as he states you should continually follow up with people even if you don't hear back from them.  I guess that depends on your viewpoint.<br /><br />There isn't much to like about this book.  I would highly recommend it for anyone looking to be able to develop their relationships.  5 out of 5 stars.
B0002OERI0|1.0|bashing on america has become such a trend and it's beating the hell outta me. dont get me wrong, i'm all for peace and all that good stuff, but let's face it, with greenday's sudden passion for political awareness and teenagers jumping on the bandwagon without any political knowledge makes the possibility for any political change seem like a joke. if you really want to make a difference educate yourself, knowledge is power. knowledge makes change, not these pop-punk-princesses. their popularity is based on name recognition instead of musical talent. they wear make-up, polish their nails and dye their hair. how is any of that relevant to political change? is the u.s. going to pull out of iraq because grown men are putting on make-up? those who think so are sadly mistaken. so do yourself a favor, instead of blowing your money on this drivel, make a donation to a credible charity. the money would go to a worthy cause instead of ending up in the pockets of these idiots. they've got enough champagne, make-up and hair dye. if you still feel the burden to support these dinosaurs then go ahead. but for those of you who are smart, download it for free on soulseek. but honestly these guys aren't worth the effort.
B0009S2T0M|2.0|Beyond the wicked twist that is supplied near the end, this pale rehash of the Count of Monte Cristo is far from the event that so many have made it out to be. Boring story, boring fights and boring characters. Where is the film that so many here and other places have talked about endlessly? Where is the film that took over Canne? <br /> <br />
B0002V01QU|5.0|I like the fact that Karn Evil 9 all impressions are linked as one piece of music.  The album had two thirds of the first impression on side one and rest of piece on side two.  Radio stations never bothered to play the first part of first impression.  This disc has piece in its entirety.  Listen to the piece and you will now understand.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|It's truly a wonderful Christmas classic for the family. The movie teaches children to have faith-to believe, and it also reminds adults the true spirit of Christmas. I think it's a very clever to present the movie like an animated cartoon, because it gives a fantasy-like feeling. Tom Hanks and the children acted fine in this film. They expressed their character's feelings really well. <br />The theme song \\"Believe\\" by Josh Groban is a really powerful song that captures the Christmas spirit and sums up the central message of the movie. I love this song very much. <br />Go get it if you haven't already! <br /> <br />Stroy A <br />Acting B+ <br />Direction B+ <br />Visuals A-
0307165485|5.0|Originally, we chose Richard Scarry's \\"Best Storybook Ever!\\" because the cover was pink.  Our young daughter (now 39) would only \\"read\\" books with pink covers and this book became known (and still is) as The Big Pink Book.  To our delight, this book became hers, and subsequently her younger sister's favorite.  They would look through the book for hours reading the stories, reciting the poems, and studying all the intricate details on the pages.  Our daughters named many of their stuffed animals after the characters in the book--Lazy Elsie Marley was a favorite.  We have given this book as gifts to all of our nieces and nephews and many of our friends.  We are so glad that it is still in print, because we continue to want to share it with new children that come into our lives.
B00004Z459|5.0|The Debut Album from Linkin Park proves that they're one of the best hard rock bands out there if not the BEST.The combination of rap and metal fits perfectly into the envirement.Hybrid Theory is what a good album is.Some songs are really hard and fast paced while others are hard but at the same time slow paced and easy.This album and this band are the kings of rock.

B000002ITW|5.0|When an absolute objective balance was made for the posterity this album must be pplaced between the top twenty live albums ever.<br /><br />This ensemble was blessed with the genius touch. This band had a very strong presence and warmth sympathy. The singleness of every one of them and the perfect vocal and harmonic balance singing Judy blue eyes, Our house, Carry on, Southern man plus the impressive domain of their twelve strings guitars, conferred for them the fabulous adjective of constitute the American response to the Beatles during their very brief existence.<br /><br />Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, David Crosby and Neil Young illuminated with high voltage and best spirits the stage on that evening of August 1969. When you remind Woodstock, for instance, the images of their performance will remain recorded I your brain<br /><br />The impact and transcendence of this album overpass by far, its own time to inscribe in the immortal Pantheon of the heaviest and most creative bands ever in USA.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|I have loved all types of music since I was a little girl. You would be amazed to see the variety I have in my home.  I was flipping channels when I came across this show on my local PBS. My daughter who will be eight this fall, came in to the room, and stayed the whole time. :D  I was fascinated in watching how she was delighted in every song that was sung, and/or performed. When I went out and bought the CD, she was so excitied and demanded that we play it right away in our vehicle, much to the dismay of my other child. lol.  My daughter was so disappointed when she had to get out of the vehicle and go into school.  I wasn't surprised that this music captured my heart and soul, but I was pleasantly surprised to have it capture that of my young daughter's. Keep up the beautiful job. Hopefully these ladies will record another album together.  The music industry has found a musical diamond in these five ladies.
B000001GX8|5.0|Mozart is the composer who engages me with the joy of living, faster than any other composer.<br /><br />Karl Bohm was in highest spirits as web as all he cast. The famous Nozze di Figaro found that evening of 1968 the sublime elegance, the joyous nuance and one offbeat performance throughout these Four Acts.<br /><br />Fisher-Diskau displayed all his undeniable talent and charismatic expression as Il Conte di Almaviva and Gundula Janowitz as la Contesa di Almaviva is fantastic. Her formidable modulation and perfect phrasing are joined with the fine humor and superb charm her character demands.<br /><br />Hermann Prey as Figaro is terrific too.<br /><br />Go for this treasured version.
B00005JKTF|3.0|The movie is beautifully photographed, crisply acted by an outstanding cast, and of course it stars the flawless Cate Blanchett.  In spite of all the knots in the story (and there's kind of a lot), this movie is genuinely humane and interesting, and it's worth your time because it has two unusual qualities that movies these days tend to lack... <br /> <br />1. Real honest-to-God empathy.  In the space of a pretty short time (say the first 20 minutes or so), \\"Charlotte Gray\\" connects you in a genuine way with the strange intense heartache that young people caught in wartime feel -- Charlotte gets swept up in a kind of desperate whirlwind romance that only people who are really living next to death and radical uncertainty can feel.  There's a unique kind of sorrow in being forced by the world to live minute-to-minute, trapped in History's clutches, and the movie captures that.  Yes, we are at war as I write this, but our entire civilization and existence are not at stake quite the way they were 60 years ago... and the movie captures somewhat how people trying to be in love at that time must have felt.   <br /> <br />2.  One of the movie's greatest flaws is also its biggest strength: the story becomes so overcrowded and chaotic that it starts to actually resemble real life in the sense that, \\"I have NO IDEA what is going to happen next!\\"  That feeling has got to be particularly acute in wartime, and in Charlotte's case (foreign agent leading double life behind enemy lines) it's completely nerve-wracking.  The story verges on being incoherent (structurally speaking, not morally speaking), but in today's movie climate of pre-packaged three-act structures with predictable breaks at every moment, that's kind of... refreshing.  Maybe I'm a naive viewer, but I really couldn't tell what was going to happen next, from moment to moment, and that kind of unpredictability is rare in movies these days (at least Hollywood ones). <br /> <br />But of course, that same incoherence iswhat keeps the movie from developing a true center of gravity, and so it keeps it from being great.  The whole theme is so incredibly overcrowded (let me get this straight: she's an undercover agent AND an active member of the French Resistance AND she's searching for her downed-pilot lover behind enemy lines AND she's hiding Jewish children from the Nazis in her farmhouse?!?  Any ONE of these would have been more than enough for a slew of movies.) <br /> <br />The most nerve-wracking scenes are the small ones, where normal people caught in strange situations simply DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  That's a real human emotion, and a scary one.  The scene in the cafe, early on, is plain terrifying.  It's too bad the filmmakers didn't focus more on smaller strands of plot, which to my mind were already incredibly large.   <br /> <br />Not a 'great' movie, but a good (and beautiful-looking) one... and one that will maybe help you to be more human. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002VEPRQ|4.0|A delightful movie the whole family will enjoy. July Andrews sure did earn her Academy award.
B000002UZ1|5.0|...therefore, I cannot and will not compare the tracks on these album to any of their other cuts or criticize the track selection. I'm going ot pretend that this was a double-LP, released when I got it, and I'm going to review on how well I like the tracks. okay? Good. Now that that's out of the way... <br /> <br />...This is great. I had never really understood the hullabaloo over the Beatles until I came across this album. There was about a three-week gap between my listen to Disc 1 and Disc 2, so great was my addiction to Disc 1. <br /> <br />\\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" does away with any preconceptions I had of the Beatles as producing only overly-happy, peppy songs. Dark and somber, with great Lennon vocals and a backing strings section, it's the perfect opener. \\"Penny Lane\\" is lighter, with a catchy bass line that was hummed for days afterwards. \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" serves not only as an opener to the album, but as a great musical number; relatively heavy guitar and backing brass that swings straight into \\"With a Little Help From My Friends.\\" My first reaction to this song was, \\"Wow, he can't sing, can he?\\" but Ringo's vocals do fit the song well; he sounds pretty nicely in his own right. <br /> <br />\\"Lucy\\" came across as a little annoying at first, but the horrifically high vocals grew on me. Lovely bass line, too. \\"A Day In the Life\\" is probably close to my favorite song. Great vocals, piano and guitar, plus Ringo's incredible drum fills and the best musical interlude of any song ever makes me wish that it was longer. Paul's bridge is perfectly timed and very well done. \\"All You Need Is Love\\" is okay, but I rarely listen to it on account of the other songs that require immediate attention, like, for instance, \\"I Am the Walrus,\\" which is just goddamn amazing any way you slice it. The only annoying part is that I hear a very good bass hook at the fade-out and can't hear it anywhere else. Bah.  <br /> <br />\\"Hello, Goodbye\\" is like \\"Love,\\" it's a good song but it doesn't crave listening as the others do. \\"The Fool On the Hill\\" caught on late to me, but is catchy. \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" is repetetive and somewhat annoying, but okay. \\"Lady Madonna\\" features some good piano and vocals, and \\"Hey Jude\\" is, of course, one of the best. The closing song, \\"Revolution,\\" took me somewhat by surprise due to its heaviness and the \\"AAAAAGH\\" opener, but it's still a great song. <br /> <br />Disc 2 starts with \\"Back In the USSR,\\" a parody of a Beach Boys song; I don't particularly care for the Beach Boys, therefore this song is merely okay in my eyes. \\"Guitar\\" is much better, and \\"Ob-La-Di\\" is a little annoying, but catchy and worth listening to. \\"Get Back,\\" I think, is my least favorite of the two discs; it sounds a bit too much like country music. \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is loud and powerful and an all-around good tune. \\"John and Yoko\\" is very catchy, and \\"Old Brown Shoe,\\" with  it's rapid-moving vocals and low guitarwork is one of the best songs in the anthology. \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is somewhat too light, but still very good. \\"Come Together,\\" the first Beatles song that I ever heard, is relatively heavy and one of my favorites. \\"Something\\" is a great, melodic Harrison love song and \\"Octopus's Garden\\" is a catchy Ringo cut, despite its similarities to country. \\"Let It Be\\" took a while to get used to, but the melody is too good to ignore. \\"Across the Universe\\" is another favorite; minimal instruments suit the subject matter and Lennon's vocals very, very well. \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" is good in its own right, but it seems overshadowed by the previous track; I wish that they'd have ended the disc with \\"Universe.\\" Track for track, I like Disc 1 better. <br /> <br />So, there you have it; an unbiased account by a 17-year old so that you get none of that \\"I lost my virginity to this song playin' on my turntable\\" nostalgic crap. The Beatles, although not a complete legend in the eyes of one who did not live during their heyday, are a great band and I'd recommend this album to Beatles fans, as well as people who have never heard the Beatles; fans of all genres will be attached for years.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Having seen this on PBS during their fund-raising period, I couldn't wait to buy it on DVD. We recently bought a new Chrysler Town & Country minivan with a DVD Mobile Theater built in. Since I don't have a home theater system, I tried this out in the van on a day trip the other day. What an experience! Being the driver, I couldn't see the concert, but didn't need to because it can stand alone as a wonderful experience without any visuals. The surround sound mix is glorious and the angelic voices of all the singers must be experienced to believe.  <br /> <br />It's my favorite concert DVD now, and if not for the gas price problem, I'd wish I had a longer commute! True music aficionados should run, not walk to buy this DVD.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Blockus is like Tetris in that you creatively construct your pieces on the gameboard, but the goal is to get all of your pieces on the board. This was an excellent beach house game, and once I returned from NC, I ordered it and now it has become the family game. If you've ever played APPLES TO APPLES, this game ranks high like that one on quality and ease of play. This game is strategical in that it makes you think and its equally entertaining. Go buy it. It's worth it.
6305388458|4.0|Monty Python, the famous comedy group from Great Britain, is not everybody's taste of humour. You either like them or hate them. \\"The Life of Brian\\" is a movie though which is able to fill this gap between liking and disliking. \\"The Life of Brian\\" is a religious satire which is nothing for conservatives. Brian is a young Judean born on the same day as Jesus. During his life he is always confronted with Jesus, religious fanaticism and the Roman occupation. He becomes a part of the PFJ ( People's Front of Judea), a fanatic movement that fights against the Romans. Through a silly coincidence the people of Jerusalem think that Brian is the Messiah and so the admiration for him begins. Finally Brian fulfils the real destiny of Jesus and is crucified. \\"The Life of Brian\\" is full of nasty and absurd humour which will entertain everybody. It's convincing right from the start. Furthermore, the film is not only about Brian himself, but also about his very \\"charming\\" mother Mandy.  <br />Before I watched \\"The Life of Brian\\" I was also one of the sceptic ones. Monty Python was not really my type of humour and I don't think it will ever be, but I have to admit that this movie is really funny and that I enjoyed it. Watch it, if you haven't done so yet and make your own opinion! <br />
1573223085|4.0|So what are we mortals, especially those of us in the Western Hemisphere, supposed to do in a world where computers are fast approaching humans in intelligence, all manufacturing work is moving to China, any white collar work that does not require face to face interaction is being taken on by India, and the marketplace is flooded with cheap, quality goods?  Such is the question that this book seeks to address.  While other, better selling authors (i.e. Friedman) are raking millions telling us the obvious (gee, those Indians are really smart, better watch out for them, and the Chinese are after your manufacturing job, etc.) Dan Pink takes a different, more practical and constructive angle on the subject, showing us instead what is left to do that can't (for now at least) be done by machines or overseas, and this involves the long neglected right hemisphere, the one right inside our skull.  And you know Pink is on to something when you look at things ranging from US labor department projections showing the highest increase in professions dealing with creativity and interpersonal communications; travel agents turning into vacation consultants; and your engineer cousin or next door neighbor turned graphic designer.  The evidence is everywhere that things are moving in a new direction.<br /><br />Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, Meaning.  In a nutshell these are the key right brain abilities that Pink considers will make the difference between success and failure into the 21st century.  The bulk of the book explores these from a very practical perspective, but even better than that, it gives you pointers and actual tools for you to begin developing these on your own.  While more subdued in tone than the overly enthusiastic \\"Free Agent Nation\\", this book nonetheless follows the same theme on self-actualization taking on a growing role in our lives over merely materialistic concerns.  And here is the main take away from the book, because while it hooks you on your materialistic concerns over how to remain competitive, it actually takes you beyond it.  Because even if you don't manage to prosper and get wealthy based on these abilities (and unless you get some left-hemisphere ones you probably won't, unless you're an artistic genius), if you think about it what Pink describes are the very qualities that distinguish us from machines,  that make us fully and uniquely human.  So by developing them you tap into your humanity, setting you on your way to a happier, richer life, and there's no better payoff than that.aterialistic concerns over how to remain competitive, it actually takes you beyond it.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|Kung Fu Hustle was one of those movies I had heard enough about to peak my interest. Once you get over the initial hurdle of reading the subtitles whilst watching the action it's just like watching any other movie. The special effects are spectacular and the storyline is actually very good. I went into this movie expecting another typical Hong Kong martial arts movie that was nothing more than average wire work fighting with a passable storyline. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The characters are believable and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen in any movie. The ending is a massive Dragonball Z inspired battle that exceeds all expectations. If this is to become the norm for movies of this genre from foreign contries I see a bright future ahead.
B000006O7C|5.0|Sad songs on here holy crap, i can't even start to explain about these fantastic well thought out songs. As always he does amazing covers too. The Second disc for the most part is drug influenced which is ok because the songs are still good but a lot harder to listen to at first. If he had been alive when he realesed it I don't know which songs or song for that matter he would realese as a single because each one doesn't usually follow the same aranged pop rock thing but don't let that turn you off    If You Buy \\"Grace\\" Then Buy \\"(Sketches For) My Sweetheart The Drunk\\"
B0000CFW87|5.0|Whether or not you enjoy the type of music he sings, there is no doubt that Josh Groban was gifted with an incredible voice. I cannot understand how anyone could ever hear \\"warbling\\" or \\"weakness\\" in his voice. He phrases well and you can feel the emotion behind his music. So many artists today can only moderately sing and they can't play any instrument or read music or do anything. Josh is a talented musician, and not only sings but plays piano and drums. The difference is palpable. This CD is a classic, and his first is as well. Put them in the 10-disc changer and leave them there!  <br />As far as song choice goes, I personally love each and every song on both of his albums, although I know that he has sometimes been packaged as \\"opera\\" or \\"popera\\" and some tracks are very far away from either of those categories, which could surprise and dismay classical lovers. But the true depth of a musical artist is tested when he attempts different genres and tries to broaden his own horizons while simultaneously broadening ours. Whether or not Josh will be famous ten years from now is irrelevant (though I think he will be), because these two CDs alone have inspired me musically and I know they have helped him grow as an artist. Excellent work, Josh. Please take care of your voice!

B00005JN0T|4.0|A bunch of robots intend to harm humans even though they have been programmed not to, a cop (Smith) tries to stop them. Great big budget action movie, decent story. Will Smith is good in this, he doesn't try to do too much. In some of his movies he becomes tiresome with his \\"always trying to be cute\\" personality, but they keep him in check in this one. The only downside to this story is there is no real victim, or somebody to feel sorry for, unless you count the poor misunderstood robot that only wants to help a cop that hates robots. Either way, worth seeing.
B0001L3MI0|1.0|I recieved a copy to replace a damaged dvd that was sent to  me. <br />The second copy did not work any better. In fact it stopped playing in the exact same place the original dvd. It freezes up and can not shutdown. I am very disapointed and have given up trying t oget a good working copy.
1400043662|4.0|If it is the first time you read Murakami, do not begin your journey with this book. You really should go through his short stories, and then at least \\"Dance Dance Dance\\" before you try this one.  It is not an easy reading, and unless you are used to Murakami's style, are familiar with some of his previous works and ideas, you will not enjoy the book as much as you potentially can. <br />On the other side, if you are already \\"hooked\\" by Norvegian forest and are able \\"to listen to the songs of the wind\\", then add this one to your bookshelf and enjoy. <br />(Sorry, I am slightly cheating here - I usually read Murakami's books in Russian translations, which are fabulous - I do not know whether Murakami was \\"lost in translation\\" into English.Hopefully, not - and it's worth the try, anyway.)
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This entire CD rocks!  The song called \\"D.O.A.\\" on their new album is rediculously awesome!  Every time it comes on the radio, I just turn it up extremely loud and smile from ear to ear.  The Foo Fighters entire CD just makes you want to quit your job and start your own band in your garage no matter how old you are!  My dad turned 50 last month and he loves the Foo Fighters!  Every person who truely appreciates rock music should buy this CD and every time you play it you'll feel like a rockstar!  (...)
B00008J2DQ|4.0|The person I bought this for really LOVES it. I like some of the music but I don't enjoy it as an album. Don't like to have to switch tracks. It did, however, make the perfect gift.

B00000AFWW|4.0|When I first listened to this album, everything after the first two tracks just sounded the same (the melody, that is), but I was only 12. Two years later (yes, I've grown so much), I can't take it out of my player. Courtney Love does not have the greatest voice, but many alternative rockers don't. The lyrics ment something.<br /><br />Track reviews: (ratings based on lyrics and sound)<br /><br />Celebrity Skin--upbeat tune, about the plastic quality most stars have, but seems to reinforce that courtney's different (\\"oh make me over, I'm all I wanna be, a walking study in demonology\\"). 5 stars.<br /><br />Awful--about the fall of stardom (\\"I was punk, I was perfect, now I'm awful\\"), but again, with an ironic upbeat tune. 4 stars.<br /><br />Hit So Hard--I think it's about being \\"hit\\" by a relationship that you really enjoy, but is f* up. Anyway, it's got a relaxing tune. 4 stars.<br /><br />Malibu--about escaping loss and  tradgedy by just ignoring it and trying to make it seem okay. 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />Reasons to be beautiful--While I enjoyed all the songs on this album, this was the first one so far that Courtney Love really seemed to be getting enthused about. Every song after this has more and more energy to it. It's about turning yourself into something everyone wants you to be--\\"beautiful\\"--for the sake of being adored. 4 stars.<br /><br />Dying--very mellow and very dramatic (\\"i'm dying I'm dying please\\"), about addiction to a love-no-more (i want to/i need to be/under your skin)..(And now I know that love is dead/You've come to bury me/There's nothing left here to pretend/Anything\\") 5 stars.<br /><br />use once and destroy--losing everything you have. 4 stars.<br /><br />northern star--the best song on the album. about rejection and lonliness. 5 stars.<br /><br />heaven tonight--after some less-than-happy lyrics on this album, heaven tonight is perky and poppy but still really good. 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />playing your song--angry song about sell outs. 5 stars.<br /><br />petals--I don't actually like this song. it's about ripping you up and exposing you to the world. 2-3 stars.<br /><br />what I'm trying to say is that this album kicked butt, and if you like alternative music, you'll like Celebrity Skin.ut sell outs. 5 stars. <br /> <br />petals--I don't actually like this song. it's about ripping you up and exposing you to the world. 2-3 stars. <br /> <br />what I'm trying to say is that this album kicked butt, and if you like alternative music, you'll like Celebrity Skin.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I love this CD so much. I misplaced the original one I bought from Wal-Mart so I purchased another on here. This CD has really great songs and shows Mariah's wonderful vocal talent off. It's only one song that I don't really like, but I listen to the rest of them.
B000021YQV|5.0|Fans in the metal community often bash this album because of the band's proximity and image association to other lackluster Billboard metal bands.<br /><br />What truly separates System of a Down from these bands, and dispels any criticism of the band's musical merits, is their fresh and unrivaled sound, coupled with a genuine interest in social welfare and the rampant plague of inhumanity in the world.<br /><br />Toxicity takes the theory behind the band's previous release, and tosses in more mature songwriting.  The rhythmic-based assault still stands up front with the well-aged, and varied vocal stylings of Serj.  When compared to the proficiency of the metal musicians I most listen to, the instrumentation is mostly simplistic, and certainly not jaw-dropping.  However, this is a band that knows where its strength lay, and the whole sonic experience (vocals, guitar, bass, drums) come together to create a hard-hitting, precise groove.<br /><br />Whether it be the bone-chilling, vocal-lead interlude towards the end of \\"Needles\\", the avalanche of melody and crunch that is \\"Aerials\\", the epic-chorused \\"Forest\\", the audio bi-polar \\"ATWA\\", or the catchy stop-go fest of \\"Chop Suey\\", this album offers enough progression, intensity, and musical cohesiveness to please any metal fan, and solidify its place as an important metal release.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|and right after blast tyrant. Absolutely amazing, these guys continue to put out quality stuff. This entire album caught me off guard, my buddy mentioned the \\"new\\" clutch album and I though he meant the one before this. Instead of banging out more of the same stuff Clutch threw away most of the program and ventured off into uncharted waters and made something special. An organ?? Ahhh yea...  <br /> <br />This is a brand new idea and blows away anything I've heard in the last 5 years. Buy this album before you die! <br /> <br />Someday Clutch will come near NorCal and I'll be there, best band on earth.

074325144X|5.0|This could have been a much shorter book.  Much of what is contained in chapters 1 - 3 is a sales pitch for the book which makes no sense since you already bought it.  Chapter 4 is where most of the good information is.  Danny's core ideas are excellent and they have helped my running substantially. I would have prefered to have seen more Chi theory in general included although some of the ancedotal information provided regarding his two Masters defies my belief. It is a book that belongs in your library if you are a runner.
6305971099|4.0|This is the most underrated horror movie out there. Sure, production was rushed to feed off the crowd of the masterpiece that was Halloween 4, but it is still a good film. It has alot of suspenseful scenes and is twice as good as teh best \\"Friday the 13th\\" movie.<br /><br />Pros: Suspenseful , GREAT acting by Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris, alot of kills (for those gore-fans) , and still contains that classic horror feeling<br /><br />Cons: Early death of Rachel (Ellie Cornell), annoying teenagers, NO Halloween feel, and has an odd ending
0201633612|5.0|I was tempted to put 4 stars instead of 5. The reason being my own inability to fully comprehend what they were talking about. I read this book during my undergrad for an C++/OOP course. The professor I had was an excellent communicator. We went through 11 of the 23 patterns, and i kind of got them in my head. But i forgot all about them after 5 months or so. I referred it back in my grad school, and I open it regularly at work. I still don't completely understand all the examples, but whenever i am short of tools to solve a problem, i refer to a page and some or the other pattern fits exactly, as a better solution to the problem at hand. Like what some reviewers said, you might need to do some work to understand all of them. I can't wait see a second edition. It has been almost 10 years now.

0805079076|5.0|Subtitled \\"An Evolutionary Tour of Mankind's Greatest Invention,\\" Deutscher immediately sets the record straight: language is an \\"uninvented invention.\\"<br /><br />  Language, says the author, has no known beginning. The best we can do is try to follow the paths backwards and forwards from today's languages to yesterday's and back again. Therein is Deutscher's genius. He makes no real attempt to define the beginning of language, since that can't be done, but he does take us on a tour of thousands of years of written and spoken language. It is, frankly, amazing to see the persistence of languages written several millennia ago in certain words while words from only a few centuries ago have totally different meanings today.<br /><br />  Deutshcer's writing style is \\"breezy\\" in a way as he attempts to make a very complext subject accessible to the non-expert. Still, the book is a moderately difficult read. Never boring, never slow: just difficult at times, particularly when Deutscher's attempts to explain things in a pseudo-language. He does a great job of explaining, but I found myself working to understand the concepts.<br /><br />  For the person interested in language and evolution, I think this a must-read. The casual reader, however, might be put off by it.<br /><br />Jerry
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Every so often, a film comes along that changes the cinematic landscape. A film that sets a new vanguard for motion pictures. A film that both influences and alienates. A film that stands the test of time as a masterpiece. \\"Scarface\\" is one of those movies. When it was first released in 1983, \\"Scarface\\" caused challenged the MPAA with its excessive use of violence, foul language and other cinematic taboos. Director Brian DePalma, screenwriter Oliver Stone, star Al Pacino and others involved with the film made sure that this film would become what it is today.<br /><br />There's no use in describing the plot, as anyone who hasn't been living under a rock since 1983 already knows it. Tony Montana (Pacino) is a Cuban immigrant who arrives at Mariel Harbor, in Miami, 1980. There, he gets involved in the only thing he knows how to do - drug dealing. Tony becomes rich. He has it all: money, women, power. However, as the stakes get higher, so does Tony (figuratively and literally). He throws away everything he earned and by the end of the movie, he can never get it back.<br /><br />This film is so powerful on so many different levels. This is more than just the film that made \\"Say Hello To My Little Friend\\" an international catchphrase. This is more than just the film that set the record for most uses of the \\"f\\" word (well over 200). This is more than just a typical shoot-em-up with oodles and oodles of violence. Look past all this silly stuff and you will find that \\"Scarface\\" is disturbing realistic and often terrifying in its brutal depiction of life. This film has influenced millions, from filmmakers to gangsta rappers. \\"Scarface\\" is a celluloid treasure.<br /><br />The way this film was done was perfect. The scenrery? Awe-inspiring. The directing? Superb. The script? Flawless. The acting? Phenomenal. Al Pacino has never done a better role than this. Had this film cut down on the cursing and possibly the length, Pacino would have definitely won an Oscar. The rest of the supporting cast deliver impeccable performances as well, including Steven Bauer, Maria Mastrentonio, Robert Loggia and especially Michelle Pfeiffer, who, at an early stage in her career, manages to steal the show from Pacino and everyone else at every chance she gets. Her final scene in the restaurant is unforgettable. Like Pacino, Michelle definitely deserved the Academy Award that year.<br /><br />Which brings us to the dvd itself. How does this 22 year old masterpiece look on dvd. Well, it looks and sounds great. The 5.1 sound and the Anamorphic Widescreen let you see and hear the movie like it was meant to be. As for bonus features, this film is, as Tony Montana might say, loaded. Deleted scenes, a slew of documenatries and various interviews with the cast and crew are all present and accounted for on this dvd.<br /><br />If you haven't seen \\"Scarface\\", you are depriving yourself of a work of art.

B00003JRCQ|4.0|In the grand scheme of Jane Austen novels, this is just as high a caliber as the rest.  This DVD however has what seems to be an abrupt ending.  The acting, in places, leaves a bit to be desired.  On the other hand, the settings were remarkable and well thought out.  Overall, I'd recommend this film to anyone and will more than likely watch it several more times myself.
039472903X|4.0|A legend in the advertising industry, David Ogilvy leads you through a wide range of topics with a captivating sense of humor and honesty.  He offers practical and very specific advice for creating ads that sell, getting a job, running an agency, getting clients, using research and much more.  <br /> <br />Ogilvy on Advertising, published in 1983, contains many ads that look dated, but the ideas and techniques that inspired them remain pertinent to this day.  David Ogilvy also gives his advice on a wide range of topics beyond print advertising, and his success serves as testament to strengths of his ideas.  Depending on what you are looking for, however, some chapters may be more useful than others. <br /> <br />David Ogilvy sums up this book best in the introduction when he states, \\"This is not a book for readers who think they already know all there is to be known about advertising.  It is for young hopefuls - and veterans who are still in search of ways to improve their batting average at the cash register.\\" <br />

B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is my first Iron Maiden album I bought, and I just need more, this is a very good album, and I knew this was made after a time of sadness (no prayer for the dying, fear of the dark, the x factor and virtual xi), but clearly they went into the right direction.<br /><br />The Wicker Man (8/10): Nice opening song, but I really think the next song is better, but this one really rocks!!<br /><br />Ghost Of The Navigator (9/10): A very good song, with a fine change of rhythm when the chorus begins, this is one of my favorites.<br /><br />Brave New World (8.5/10): The title track, very good, begins peaceful, and then it begins to rock, check it out, you'll love this song.<br /><br />Blood Brothers (8/10): Definitely a good song, but I needed to listen this one very good, because I didn't like this one first.<br /><br />The Mercenary (9/10): Very good rocker, I want you to love this one.<br /><br />Dream Of Mirrors (10/10): One of the best songs, and I say that with justice, cause this one IS good, begins calmly, and gets harder after each stanza, until it's very fast.<br /><br />The Fallen Angel (10/10): This isn't an overrating, you'll only understand it if you listen to it, I can only say that it's a pretty fast one.<br /><br />The Nomad (9/10): Beautiful, very good lyrics and music, the last one sounds Arabian, very well done.<br /><br />Out Of The Silent Planet (9/10): Surely it's good, listen to Dickinson's voice mixed with the music, you'll really be surprised about the quality of the music.<br /><br />The Thin Line Between Love And Hate (8/10): Good song, with a good piece of work made here, ofcourse it is good work with every song but I just needed to say that ;).<br /><br />As you can see I really like this album, and I highly recommend this one to every hard rock/(heavy)metal fans. Iron Maiden created a brave new world for me...<br /><br />Keep On Rocking!!!!!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is a quirky film that will become a cult classic. It is timeless and for anyone that grew up in the 1980's it might mean a bit more..especially with some great 80's music thrown in. Everyone had a \\"Napoleon\\" in their school and probably some Napoleon in themselves. School dances, bullies, school lunches with tater tots and square pizza, riding the school bus....it is the little things we all experienced that make this film funny as hell.  It also gets funnier each time you see it, especially his facial expressions and body language.       BTW, It amazes me that so many people don't understand this film. I guess it is probably because they are only attracted to the big budget action films or need a story fed to them without thinking.

B000AADYYO|5.0|Great music speaks for itself. But for those who are new to the band, to really understand what Opeth has created, you will have give yourself some time to listen repeatedly. Yes, you will have to deal with some preconceptions you may have about the way(s) Mikael sings. Even harder to let go are the stereotypes about metal music that persist even after four decades of ceaseless invention.  <br /> <br />Opeth fans cringe when they hear comments like \\"Not bad for a death metal band.\\" Hell, Opeth is the best band of any genre, period. No contest. As for pigeon holes, Opeth happens to be hard to place. The only hope is to consider a new prog-metal-folk-jazz hybrid,the combined natural habitats of the creative musician.  <br /> <br />Never fear the complexity of the music itself...all becomes clear on the third or fourth listen. Admittedly, it takes a while to appreciate the dark emotional power of the melodies. But bit by bit you start to make out examples of peerless musicianship. Note-perfect passages of unrivalled brilliance emerge from the background. Then it dawns on you that you are in the presence of genius. <br /> <br />And finally...surrendering to the now-obvious strength of the music...you come to believe that Mikael Akerfeldt is a god.  <br /> <br />You may think that I'm being a tad ridiculous, but years of listening to Opeth makes it clear to me that Mikael Akerfeldt is the most signficant composer of our generation. He's an astonishingly fine singer and guitar player as well. Universal acclaim may not come, but those who really listen to Opeth WILL experience profound greatness firsthand. <br /> <br />Like I said, great music speaks for itself. You simply have to listen to what it's telling you.
B000001FGG|5.0|Disraeli Gears gets more attention, but I myself prefer Wheels. Why? There were some slight songs on Gears (Outside Woman Blues, Mother's Lament, etc.) and it was a bit too pop for me. I like every song on Wheels, and feel it definetly can't be considered pop.<br /><br />It opens with my favorite Cream tune, White Room...you gotta love the amazing guitar intro and solos. Sitting On Top of the World, meanwhile, is a strange slice of psychadelic blues. Then there's one of Ginger Baker's contributions, Passing the Time, which is pretty strange but has a great line (Passing the time/wine and time rhyme). As You Said is kinda spacy and drugged-out, but I liked it.<br /><br />Next comes a candidate for strangest song ever: Pressed Rat and Warthog, a tale of a rat and a warthog who closed down their shop, narrated by Ginger Baker. After all the good, yet druggy, songs end, we get Jack Bruce's sneering blues Politician, built around a killer riff like so many other good Cream songs, then my favorite Baker composition, Those Were The Days, using elements of Greek mythology like Tales of Brave Ulysses before it. Born Under a Bad Sign is one of the three superb covers, and Deserted Cities of the Heart is a very good tune with a great title.<br /><br />The second disc is made up of four live cuts, the first and best being classic Crossroads. But the Willie Dixon cover Spoonful is also strong, with some great guitarwork by Clapton, even if it does stretch to nearly seventeen minutes. After that comes Traintime, which features some great harmonica playing. The only problem is that the harmonica is the only sound you hear, along with a bit of ad-libbed vocal, for seven minutes.<br /><br />The album closes with Toad, another lengthy song, this one a jam. It's basically a sixteen-minute drum solo, with a bit of full-band work in the beginning and the end. It's an uneven song. The first seven or eight minutes are amazing, but the next seven are okay. When we get to the fourteen minute mark, however, Baker solos with furious intensity. Then the rest of the band joins. I feel a whole seven minutes could've been cut from Toad, then I would've loved it.<br /><br />This is my favorite Cream album, with some great improvs. Highly reccomended.ker solos with furious intensity.

B00079HZUM|5.0|I recomend this movie to anyone who enyoys epic movies. But I have to tell that this is not a common epic movie and if you watch it you will know why. The actors did a great job, specially Bill Crudup. It's just a great epic romantic movie with a different touch!!!!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Of course he liked it... stylized over the top violence, twists turns... this movie is challenging to watch!!  So much meaning is caught up in small phrases and most of those come right before scene changes... this is a movie that can be watched a couple of times!!  Two notes...  #1 the violence and some other scenes are probably a little too much for preteens or younger;  #2 - You really should watch the deleted scenes.. there are a few that make the whole plot fall together... not sure I would of deleted the one of the antagonist talking to himself in the mirror.... when I saw that - the whole movie made much more sense. <br /> <br />Still... very minor flaws... definitely a should see (without the kiddos :)) <br /> <br />Oh yeah... one of the fight scenes will end up being a classic.. very well done!!!
B00007E8V4|5.0|I for one, think this is System's best, it isn't the same formula of one hard simple riff over and over, but it has songs with a lot of rhythym and melody...In my opinion it is their best work..unless  the upcoming \\"Hypnotize\\" is better.
B000063UR2|2.0|Where to start?  Ok, Ridley Scott is a good sometimes even excellent director.  And as proof of his skills, the visuals are outstanding, truly fantastic.  But the script is mind-numbing and weak.  There seems to be a strange perception out there that all that is needed for a good fantasy is a unicorn, a princess and a boy named Jack. <br /> <br />And perhaps that's true but the problem is compounded in this film by the fact that it contains only one really good performance, Tim Curry as the devil, red skin, horns, hoofs and all.  Talk about camp. <br /> <br />But, as an example of how hollow this endeavor seems, consider this.  The characters of Jack and Lily end up in the same condition, the same relationship, the same place they started; as two giggling innocents in the woods.  In fact, it is Jack that is left in the woods as his princess, Lily, galumphs back to her castle after having lisped, \\"May I come again?\\" as if she were going home from a picnic.  <br /> <br />There is no sense of gain or loss or growth as there was in LOTR.  To tell the truth Tim Curry's devil, of all the characters, had the most humanity in him.  His fate actually seemed pitiable.  One cared about him.  You see what a good actor can do? <br /> <br />You see what the difference is between a good actor and someone like Tom Cruise or that Mia Sara critter (who seemed to think that she was acting if she cast her eyes back and forth and breathed really hard)? <br /> <br />And that brings me to something else.  Why do good directors constantly cast mediocre or just plain bad actors like Tom Cruise for instance?   <br /> <br />One very famous director said that if one casted correctly, all one's work was done.  Maybe many directors believe that everything is ok if the actors just look the parts.  Maybe these directors think that they can provide what is lacking through their brillance as directors.   <br /> <br />Well, I've haven't seen that happen very often. (Orson Wells directing Charleton Heston in Touch of Evil did actually pull it off.  But Wells was a certified genius and Heston was a mostly mediocre actor who could rise to the occassion when properly inspired.)  But, it certainly didn't happen in this case and I've never seen it happen with Tom Cruise.  I don't get what top flight directors see in him.

(With the exception of the last track) But don't let this discourage you, the CD is absolutely brilliant! From The Cry of Mankind, A Sea To Suffer In and Your Shameful Heaven this CD offers no shortage of dark and moody songs begging for the darkest of hearts to come and embrace them. Yes I'm being dramatic but I'm NOT exaggerating, it's that good. The version released with  bonus live disk is worth getting if you can find it (it's still easy enough) as it gives you a tatse of MDB live and full of emotion! If your a fan of My Dying Bride and you don't own this CD I ask you; Why the hell not! If you enjoy dark and extreamly depressing music then Angel And The Dark River is a must have for your collection. Five stars all the way!
B000ASATYO|5.0|Just before doing \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" director Peter Jackson (who can be seen in a cameo as \\"Man with Piercings\\") made an off-kilter horror/comedy movie called \\"The Frighteners,\\" the tale of the undead and the guy who makes a living off of them. Though \\"Frighteners\\" was barely in theaters at all, this cult flick is funny, creepy, well-acted and wonderfully directed.<br /><br />Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) has seen spirits and apparitions ever since the car crash that killed his wife. Now he operates an amateur \\"ghostbusting\\" operation that is supposed to exorcise ghosts from people's houses -- the problem is that the ghosts who haunt those houses are in league with him (Chi McBride as the opinioated afro-ed Cyrus, Jim Fyfe as the nerdy Stuart, and most of John Astin as what is left of The Judge).<br /><br />Frank's business certainly isn't hurt by the fact that for years after a serial killer's murderous spree, people have died mysteriously of heart attacks. Then Frank starts seeing fiery numbers emblazoned on the foreheads of people who will die, including the husband of doctor Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado). As if trying to stop a specter of death weren't hard enough, crazed FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs) believes that Frank is the one murdering people. But the evil specter is still killing -- and Lucy is the next victim.<br /><br />Peter Jackson once said that he has a \\"moronic\\" sense of humor, and it shows up in all its glory here -- from bug spray dissolving a ghost's face to a piece of talking oily sludge to a drill sargeant ghost with submachine guns, this is weird and absolutely hilarious. It's the perfect blend of comedy and horror.<br /><br />But he's also good during the more serious moments, such as Bannister's flashbacks to his wife's death, or the eerie sight of homicidal young lovers dancing with a gun. The opening shot is pure Jackson, with the camera swooping through a window, past fluttering curtains, and though a hole in the attic floor to a screaming woman below.<br /><br />Jackson also takes the opportunity to poke a bit of fun at more conventional ghost movies: the big Gothic house, crazy old lady, ghost in '70s clothes, and Fox's hilarious turn as a ghostbuster. Nothing horrific is sacred. \\"There ain't nothing worse than a bunch of pissed-off brothers... that's ALREADY DEAD!\\" Cyrus yells at one point.<br /><br />Does it have a flaw? Yes -- the opening scene doesn't seem to make much sense later on in the movie. But Jackson makes up for that with a surprisingly tight, coherent plot, and a satisfying finale that makes more sense than most other horror movies do.<br /><br />The cast is brilliant, whether it's the twitchy, wild-eyed FBI agent, or the three weird ghosts.  Michael J. Fox does an excellent job as Frank, with the right combination of cockiness and pathos, while Alvarado is solid as the idealistic young doctor. But the scenes are reallystolen by Dee Wallace-Stone and freaky-eyed Jake Busey, as homicidal young lovers.<br /><br />\\"Frighteners\\" might not make you believe in ghosts, but it will make you laugh, shiver, and maybe even shed a tear or two. Wildly funny, weird, gross, and sometimes really peculiar, this is Jackson's splatter-gore at its best.in the attic floor to a screaming woman below.  <br />  <br />Jackson also takes the opportunity to poke a bit of fun at more conventional ghost movies: the big Gothic house, crazy old lady, ghost in '70s clothes, and Fox's hilarious turn as a ghostbuster.

B0009MAO46|5.0|The movie...a classic. Now it has been perfected with DTS sound. <br />If you don't know or don't have DTS capabilites...go to your local best buy and ask how to get it. It perfects the movie experience. Turn it up!! To Infinity and Beyond.
0671027387|5.0|This book was great. The plot kept twisting and turning. Just when I thought I had it all figured out and was feeling a little smug there was one more huge twist that I never saw coming. Everything Dan Brown writes it wonderful. I highly recomend it.
B00005JODA|5.0|Scary and to the point thriller that will not only leave you breathless but really moved in the same time. Ralph Fiennes solidifies himself to be one of the best actors around with an understated performance that is soul searching and haunting and Rachel Weisz steals the movie with an award winning performance that is with out a doubt one of the best of the year. She is fearless and ballsy but also human and her character's insecurities and faults are all out in the open for the viewer to witness. The story is also top notch with twist and turns at every corner and the ending will leave you speechless.  <br /> <br />This is one of the best films of the year and it deserves the great word of mouth.  <br />
B00003CXCT|3.0|like many of you, i also abhorred the changes lucas made to our canonized original; i only consider myself lucky to have bought the \\"last original versions\\" on vhs in the mid-90s.  i won't rehash the changes, nor will i express further consternation at this bastardization.  i will, however, say that these dvd changes bring with them \\"a new hope,\\" so to speak.  with such openness to change/edit/modify/\\"improve,\\" perhaps george lucas will not object to completely rewriting (the idiotic romantic dialogue in II), recasting (anakin with a kid who can act, though a point could be made about mark hamill's initial acting skills), reanimating (jar jar OUT of the picture along with that stupid pod race), rereleasing new versions of episodes I and II (save for the darth maul/quai gon/obi-wan scene that almost made me cry in I and that badbutt yoda scene in II). <br /> <br />apologies for that rather run-on diatribe.  i do, however, adamantly assert that episode III was absolute redemption for mr. lucas.  which is why i'm (sorta) defending you now.
B000002UAU|5.0|Well, i am 16 and i even no this album can't be beaten. Sure, Dark Side Of The Moon is good but this is GREAT. its got evrything.... soft, hard, nice and fun easy to listen to music. if you are a fan of The Beatles you've just got to have this album!
B00000J9HF|4.0|If you wonder what you get when you take a lecherous petty noble, an insulting court jester, an angry father who is not afraid to use curses at the drop of a hat, a group of kidnappers and assassins, and add an innocent young girl who is taken advantage of by the powers that be, the result is the opera RIGOLETTO. This musical story of a curse that causes the death of a young woman and shows what comes around goes around has been a favorite since its premiere. The addicting music combined with recordings that include some of the greatest singers in history assure that it will be a favorite for years to come<br /><br />This recording is a technically perfect RIGOLETTO. The conductor Carlo Maria Giulini brings Verdi's score to life exactly as it's written, but somehow this literal reading is missing something. There are no flourishes here. Gilda's \\"Caro Nome\\" sung beautifully by Ileana Cotrubas does not have the vocal acrobatics that have become the signature of other  sopranos. Rigoletto does not go into convulsions when his daughter is kidnapped. There are no high notes at the end of the quartet \\"Bella figla dell'amore.\\" My guess is that they are not written in the score, so Guilini excludes them. The only problem, we are so used to them something is missing, and I would argue that since Verdi had such a great instinct for what worked on stage, he'd want whatever worked in the theatre. It's not surprising that this is the case in some of Guilini's recordings of opera. While he loved opera, he hated opera houses and in later years refused to conduct live productions of opera. This probably gave him a greater appreciation of the music, but not the greatest understanding of the listener.<br /><br />While this recording may be somewhat lackluster at times, it still has many merits. Giulini keeps the pace moving in this recording (which is not the case in IL TROVATORE) and the orchestra and chorus are excellent. The overall singing is good, and Domingo's interpretation of the Duke which is not buffoonish, makes him believable to the listener. Since it is now released in the mid-price category, it's a bargain as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!tion of the Duke which is not buffoonish, makes him believable to the listener.

B000002UAX|4.0|some songs on this album (meaning both of the 2 discs) can get a little weird, but when a song on this is good it's really good. There's somthing for the new age guys in Helter Skelter and somthing funny and charming in Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da. Some songs may even bring a tear to the eye, but thats what makes it so great. i love it and you will to!
B00003CXCW|5.0|<br />In the part of Los Angeles' Sunset Blvd. where office buildings give way to mansions and wooded areas lies the American Gothic residence of forgotten silent film actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson in a career-capping performance) and her faithful butler Max (silent filmmaker Erich von Stroheim).  Max plays the organ.  There is a burial for a pet monkey.  The tiled living room is full of photos of Desmond (actually Swanson, who DID work with Stroheim in the 1920's).  Outside is an empty swimming pool with rats and cobwebs.  Norma lives in a bygone past era untouched by the real world. <br /> <br />But then a down-on-his-luck screenwriter named Joe Gillis (William Holden), fleeing creditors out to repossess his car, has car trouble and pulls into the Desmond mansion driveway.   Joe represents the real Hollywood of 1950.  So does a Paramount story reader named Betty Schaeffer (Nancy Olson).  Billy Wilder's incomparable SUNSET BLVD. (1950, Paramount) is one of the best films ever made about Hollywood--both the past dreams represented by Norma and the present-day reality of Betty.  Joe really likes Betty, but finds himself drawn deeper and deeper into Norma's fascinating world.  She lets him use her fancy limousine after his car is towed away, and she outfits him in elegant clothing.  He lives in a cottage above the garage and is hired to get her hopeless life dream screenplay of Salome into shape \\"for Mr. DeMille.  We made several pictures together.\\"  That would be Cecil  B. DeMille, who DID make several silent features with a young Swanson and appears here as himself.  Joe all but becomes Norma's lover, as well as employer. <br /> <br />Meanwhile in the real world, Betty wants to write a script with Joe that will truly sell.  She is third-generation Hollywood, or maybe just second.  We never see her at home, only in her office at Paramount.  The two main women compliment each other.  Each has a script they want produced, and each is curious about who Joe is seeing.  Nancy Olson is wonderful as Betty, making her as warm and sweet as Swanson's Norma is grasping and insanely jealous.  Norma hates being told this is a comeback, convinced that her fans still love her.  She does not suspect that they all come from Max and is too unstable to be told the truth. <br /> <br />And what is going to happen when Joe gets tired of being Norma's kept man in a living museum?  Wilder and his writers ingeniously have SUNSET BLVD. narrated by Joe as a corpse lying face down in a swimming pool that now has water in it.  This grabber of an opening scene has paramedics and media trucks all arriving at the Desmond mansion at dawn and Joe narrating voice-over his whole story as one giant flashback.  So we know that Joe ends up dead.  And it probably is by Norma and  probably with a gun.  But how do we get from plot point A to point B? <br /> <br />SUNSET BLVD. is a fabulously baroque and impeccably acted (all four leads got Oscar nominations!) movie treasure.  The incomparable set design inside Norma's mansion is matched by the American Gothic B&W photography (artificial light and candles inside the mansion is juxtaposed against natural light in the outside real world). Franz Waxman's score is unforgettable, a blending of romantic and scary strains.  And  the final scene with the cops and press is a lulu (\\"I can't go on, I'm so happy.  Mr. DeMille, do you mind if I say a few words...All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my closeup.\\"). <br /> <br />
B000002UAO|4.0|What a fantastic album. with all the songs we know and love, its perfect easy listening and somewhat refreshing in a way. To lie back and listen to Beatle magic is delightful. If you dislike the Beatles but you don't really know about them, this should help your SOUL find its way.
0613325419|5.0|A quick, fun read filled with humor, wit and perhaps even some insights.
6301969294|1.0|The idiotic speechifying has me wondering why this isn't a staple of the college midnight movie scene. <br /> <br />Where's the \\"zero star\\" rating?
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I don't normally listen nor like this type of music. However, something happened when I first heard Take Me Out. That would be the irresistible urge to tap my foot along to the beat. That's pretty much the story of this album. Every song on here is very catchy in their own ways with none sounding like the other. <br /> <br />It's also not only the catchy beats that make the songs addictive but also the vocals of Kapranos are beautifully done. In most songs he also changes the tempo or style of his singing which shows his versatility. The songs themselves appear pretty simple in terms of drums and such but that doesn't stop them from sticking in your head. <br /> <br />The material of the songs usually fit relationships or dance type themes. Everyone should know that the assassination of Franz Ferdinand started World War I and Take Me Out is a song covering that subject rather than the assumed asking someone out. The lyrics can be very deep and symbolic as well as simple in the case of Michael. <br /> <br />Really, if you are a fan of this retro type movement of music you should have this CD in your collection. Even if you aren't, like I wasn't, you should perhaps give this a try in some form or another(be it sampling the 30 sec clips here or buying the CD).
B0000TLA9G|5.0|AFD was the perfect debut: rough rock, rebel LA boys showing their crazy way of life. Lies is a good collection, with four acoustic tracks that show some evolution. Then UYI 1 and 2, so great. TSI sucked when comparing to the other albums, but still pretty good. Then Live Era, good live performances collection. And what's missing? You got, a Best Of. Does this album fill that place? Not really.  Where's Mr. Brownstone? Nightrain? Dust n' Bones? Right Next Door To Hell? Perfect Crime? 14 Years? Estranged? GNR's greatest hits must be at least 2 cds. And must have the right choice of songs,  not this one. Don't bother buying it. It's not woth your money. Do the selection yourself. If it's your first impression of band, don't think GNR is just this. There's much more in their collection.
1932907009|5.0|Save the Cat! might well be the last book on screenwriting you'll ever need.  Mr. Snyder not only provides a Beat Sheet with a universal structure that's practical and the most useful in generating story since The Hero's Journey, he guides the writer from the spark of an idea through troubleshooting your finished manuscript.  Snyder presents familiar, contemporary, relevant examples to illustrate straightforward principles.  His \\"laws of screenplay physics\\" show you how to create a sympathetic hero, painlessly work in exposition, keep your story believable, and more.  For novelists as well as screenwriters, here's your toolkit.  If I had to limit my recommendation for the writer's essential library to three books, they would be Bird by Bird, The Writer's Journey, and Save the Cat.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Blade 2 is a awesome movie the whole series is awesome. Wesley Snipes is the only man to do the job of killing vampires. When it comes to kill the mutant creature that came from another vampire he is the man to do the job. When he needs the blood he jumps in and start kicking butt. I recommend that all people own this movie and watch it everyday for the rest of your lives and live by it. It is the best movie of all time to where I would make it my last wish to see Wesley Snipes in full costume.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Forget Star Trek, forget Star Wars.  This is the science fiction series of the new millenium.  Firefly is an amazing series that came under everyone's radar for the brief time it was on Fox.<br />Watching the DVD of all 14 episodes, including 3 that never made it to television will have you thinking two thoughts.  One will be, what an amazing series and the second, who were the clowns who cancelled it?<br />Worth buying so you can watch it over and over again.
B00006FDCD|5.0|It is a movie that I saw when I was in seventh grade. I remember everyone telling me how scary it was, even my older cousin told me how scary is was. When I watched it, I didn't see what everyone thought why it was so scary. This isn't a bad movie though. I would never have known it was amde for TV, that's how good of a job the filmakers did with this movie. I'm guessing that if you have to fear the clown's (believe me that's nothing to be ashamed of) then this movie is probably one of the scariest movies you'll ever see. This is one of the few Kings movies that kids can see, it's isn't as shocking as \\"The Shining\\", or a disturbing as \\"Pet Sematary\\". There is some killing, but the violence isn't shown. There is some blood, but it isn't real disgusting. The acting is pretty good with an exceptional performance from Tim Curry as the famous clown known as Pennywise.
0804106304|3.0|I am aware that many people and critics have given much critical acclaim for The Joy Luck Club, and how today it's considered a modern classic novel of the Asian-American experience. First of all, Amy Tan is an excellent writer. The only good things i can say about this book is how it examines the relationships between mother and daughter, American stereotypes of Asians, and i like how Amy Tan allows all of the mothers and daughters to have their own voice with each of their narratives. The only problem i have with this novel, however, is that all of the characters and their narratives are so one-dimensional, and she herself seems to stereotype her own characters and their men. Even though Amy Tan does make a few points about America's perception of Asian-Americans, and the stereotypes, she doesn't really break new ground with it. It's common knowledge that Asian get stereotyped, pretty much all minorities do. And she doesn't really break those stereotypes, to some degree she kind of enhances non-Asians to actually believe those stereotypes. And all in all, i just feel that the stories are not very consistent. Some seem to correlate with another story, and some just seem kind of random. And in my opinion, they are pretty forgettable. The only memorable story was Jing-Mei Woo: \\"The Joy Luck Club,\\" where she learns more about her mother and discovers that she has 2 half-sisters in China. I kind of thought that the rest of the book would be more about that, and more about the Joy Luck Club in general. But after that it just felt as if i were reading short stories from highschool portfolios.  I dunno, overall, an interesting read, but based on what i read i don't really understand why this book is considered a \\"classic\\" for no other reason in that it examines the relationships between mother and daughters very well. It doesn't necessarily make it a memorable book that i will read years later. And like i said before, just because the characters are Asian and they talk about the problems of stereotypes and cultural differences between the ones they came from and the one they moved in doesn't necessarily make it the BEST book that talks about the Asian-American experience. I just think there are better books out there that can make this same message without making it seem so predictable and one-dimensional.out the problems of stereotypes and cultural differences between the ones they came from and the one they moved in doesn't necessarily make it the BEST book that talks about the Asian-American experience.

B00006JDVV|4.0|Sure, it was cheesy and low budget, but the indomitable Rob Bowman didn't pull any punches in this futeristic drama about dragons. Giving a scientific edge to a creature based in fantasy, this film proved to be a rather refreshing step in science fiction, which means it won't be a well received one. I really love seeing those dragons flying in the air they look so real breathing fire.
B0006L5RT2|4.0|james blunt has the most melancholic voice  i have ever heard of...when i first listen to the single,you're beautiful,his voice really caught my attention....he sounded so sad and yet victorious in a way.... <br />  <br />other noteworthy songs worth listening in this album are wiseman,tears and rain and high...

044022165X|5.0|I believe this is the book that defines Grisham as a writer.  He weaves so many elements into this emotionally charged story.  He gives us humor, heartache, twists and turns all in one novel.  He gives the reader a great look at what it actually \\"costs\\" to get through a graduate degree.  The struggle for grades, money to pay rent and buy food, and the search for a job in an already flooded job market.   <br /> <br />If you've ever had to struggle to get a claim paid through an insurance agency, this book will strike a chord with you also.  The injustice of Big Business screams in this book.  Rudy is a loveable, believable character and it's fun to watch as he struggles to learn the ropes.  You'll want to cheer as he's taken under the wing of a seasoned judge.  This judge marches in like Nemesis against Rudy's powerful legal opponents.     <br /> <br />Speaking of characters, there are so many rich and real ones in this book.  My family is from the South and Grisham has such a way of portraying these lovely people without stereotyping them, but also exposing their struggles.  Although understated, Dot Black is a true heroine in the story.  We feel the anguish of this family in dealing with their son's terminal illness.  <br /> <br />Other memorable players in the story are Deck and Miss Birdie.  You'll be chuckling with every chapter and their antics. <br /> <br />Grisham gives you a look into Memphis, at the rich and powerful as well as a glimpse of its dark underbelly.   <br /> <br />His characterization is what brings me back to his books over and over again.  If this is what draws you, then this book won't dissappoint!  This book doesn't have the fast-paced action of the Firm, but it shouldn't.  It's about a young law student's struggles to survive in a tough world and this is something that devlops over time.  The book reminds us how slowly the wheels of justice can turn, especially for the poor.   <br /> <br />Once you read the book, check out the audio versionfrom your local library.  Michael Beck makes these charcters really come to life and I thoroughly enjoyed this book the 2nd time while travelling in the car.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I swear my life's quest has been finding a pair of suitable headphones/earphones to excercise in. I saw these and I thought...oh SONY! Perfect. Except no. When they weren't falling off my actual head, the buds refused to stay in my ear. They were so flimsy. Not quality like I would have expected of Sony. Maybe one day I will find some headphones....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a late convert to the Firefly fandom. I had a friend who let me borrow the set. After watching the first disc, I bought my own copy. It is a terrible shame that Fox sucks when it comes to knowing what the public will like. This show was not given half a chance. Fox did not even air the pilot until much later.  <br />     The story is of a Capt. Mal Reynolds and his crew (all of which endear themselves to you). Mal just wants to keep flying. Of course the story takes place in space. But there are no hokey aliens. The bad guys are the government ( I love it already). Of course there are reavers and other no goods trying to get the captain and his crew.  <br />      I love Firefly because I love the crew and I love the ship. Everyone has their faults, but they all work together and have become family. Some of my favorite scenes are when the crew is eating together or playing ball. I feel that Joss Whedon has done a superb job of characterization with each member. You only git more in more hooked as ya watch! This is the Best Damn TV show! <br />      IF you love sci fi with a western twist this is more than that. Do not hesistate.
0930289234|5.0|The first image you see is a yellow smiley-face button with a drop of something red crossing one eye. You soon realize that the button is resting in a gutter full of the red stuff, which turns out to be blood. By the time you reach the bottom of the page, it becomes obvious that someone wearing the button was defenestrated from a great height and landed on the pavement below.<br /><br />This is the first page of what most people would call a comic book, but with 384 pages and a $14.95 cover price, Watchmen by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons is more of a graphic novel. It is definitely not for children. This is pretty strong even for some adults. As an introduction to the genre, it is a work of epic proportions that will keep you glued to the pages well into the late hours of the night.<br /><br />It starts as a murder mystery. The victim was a \\"costumed vigilante\\" called The Comedian, whose career began in the late 1930's. In the first chapter, we meet several of his contemporaries, most of whom are in forced retirement. It turns out that society eventually rebelled against the plethora of \\"caped crusaders.\\" Congress passed a law banning super-heroes after a nation-wide police strike to protest their activities. One of the \\"masks\\", a mysterious characters known as Rorschach, refused to retire. He undertakes the investigation of the death of The Comedian.<br /><br />In a story that covers three weeks of October, 1985, we are treated to forty years of \\"alternate\\" American history through flash-backs, magazine articles, and excerpts from an autobiography. We meet Dr. Manhattan, a being with god-like superpowers that are the result of a nuclear accident in the 1950's. Thanks to his intervention, America won the war in Viet Nam, and the Soviets refuse to negotiate arms reduction until we include Dr. Manhattan as a \\"weapon\\". Nixon is in his third term. The Comedian single-handedly freed the American hostages from Iran.<br /><br />The characters are anything but cardboard. The second Silk Spectre is a woman who is bitter about her mother having denied her a normal childhood by training her as a replacement. Confined to a nursing home, mom is vicariously attempting to continue an adventurous life through her daughter's exploits. Rorschach is the abused, bastard son of a prostitute, but his psychotic behavior is based on a noble value system. Dr. Manhattan is a bit like Vonnegut's Billy Pilgrim from Slaughterhouse Five in that he lives simultaneously in the past, present, and future.<br /><br />The second chapter revolves around the funeral of The Comedian, and we see him through the eyes of different people who knew him during his career. It is not a pretty picture. For a \\"good guy,\\" he is not what you would call a role-model. The flash-backs segue with the funeral in a fluid, almost cinematic way. It might take the reader a while to get used to the segues between action taking place simultaneously in New York and California. In another cinematic device, the words from one scene are frequently superimposed on the images of the other. This is actually preparing the reader for things to come.<br /><br />There is a very interesting sub-plot which involves a kid reading a \\"traditional\\" comic book, a pirate story, in which the words and images fuse with the events going on around him. In fact, a lot of the story takes places in a neighborhood in New York City which centers around one intersection where an old man runs a news stand. Most of the characters eventually pass through this intersection and pass the boy reading his comic, although none engage him in conversation. It really takes a second reading to appreciate the importance of this corner, and the way in which the characters have been so long inter-related without being aware of each other.<br /><br />This work was originally published over the course of a year, in twelve monthly installments as a \\"maxi-series\\" of comic books. At the end of each \\"chapter\\", there are a few pages of text which provide background for the characters and the plot. There are chapters from the first Night Owl's autobiography, in which we discover that some of the men (and women) who wore skin-tight costumes and capes were closet homosexuals. There is an article by the second Night Owl from an ornithological journal. There is a Playboy-type interview with the first Silk Spectre and clippings from her scrap-book. There is a page from Rorschach's police blotter and psychiatric reports from the foster home where he was raised. The essay entitled, \\"Dr. Manhattan: Super-powers and the Superpowers,\\" explores the geo-political consequences of having a real superman on America's side.<br /><br />Alan Moore spent five years creating this story, and the beauty of it is that he has described each panel in such intricate detail that Dave Gibbons' pen makes us forget we are looking at static pictures on paper. There are several scene's involving Rorschach where we are treated to three or more pages of nine panels each where there is not a single word spoken, nor is any needed. There are other places where the segue between two scenes is like a cinematic dissolve, because the graphic elements of the two panels are identical.

0440238609|3.0|The children in this series spend no time at all being children, and even kids forced to grow up quickly are still not little adults in their decision making.  The series is inventive and clever, though the main characters are never believable.  This is somewhat OK because it is aimed at children, and they may like their heroes to have baggage but remain uncomplicated.  I don't know where else it has been tried, but it probably didn't succeed there either. <br /> <br />The trilogy also is stocked with too many characters.  It suffers from too many minor players taking up time that should have been spent developing the characters of the mains.  There is next to no character development, so you either buy these twelve year olds as the saviors of the multiverse or you do not.  I didn't. <br /> <br />Because of the length of the series, and the time commitment to something so predictable, I can't recommend it.  I am giving it more stars than you may think from the review, because the author did try something different with the plot, and can turn a sentence well.  Better an ambitious failure than mediocrity.
B000089RVX|3.0|When Evanescence came out there was alot of hype, especially when they released \\"Bring Me To Life.\\" Now I realize most reviewers on this page have given mainly 5 star reviews - therefore if you're reading this, then chances are you feel the same way. I'm not here to diss Evanescence, it's not helpful or constructive. Allow me to give you my take on Evanescence's \\"Fallen,\\" and possibly give you another perspective on the album.<br /><br />The first thing about this album is that it's a little more multi-dimensional than most other Rock bands. For example, \\"My Immortal,\\" is actually quite a refreshing song that's performed on piano. I personally don't subscribe to this style, but I realise there are many individuals who enjoy this kind of \\"piano-ballad\\" style. As I said, \\"Fallen,\\" isn't really my style at all - I've heard it, but don't own it. Not because it's necessarily bad, but simply because it doesn't appeal to me very much.<br /><br />\\"Bring Me To Life,\\" is a song that I don't enjoy at all. I find it to be too much like Linkin Park (as evidenced by the fuzzy guitars and rapping etc.) and also because I find it plays on the tired angst seen mostly in the Grunge era. You may enjoy it, buy personally I just find it to be a formulaic song that is aimed at large audiences. \\"Everybody's Fool,\\" is yet another song I don't enjoy - I think it's better than \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" and the message is a little more interesting, but once again we see a formulaic and predictable approach. I'm also not convinced by Amy Lee's image - she's very wealthy, very happy and very successful - yet she tries to sell us the image that she's hard-done-by, angst-ridden, poorly treated and largely unhappy (in the majority of songs on the album anyway.)<br /><br />Look, Evanescence have talent and Amy Lee has a powerful voice. I believe they should try and find their own style though. \\"My Immortal,\\" is the best example of this: it's quite unique, refreshing and pleasant. There again, it may not be conducive for Evanescence to change or create their own sound as they would lose many of their fans. Perhaps one could say that Evanescence faces a huge conundrum in their career. They could take two possible courses I believe: 1) Repeat their successful formula and maintain many fans, but in the process also piss off many fans who want something original and new (Linkin Park repeated their sound EXACTLY and are now paying the price for it) or 2) Create a new sound or concentrate on more positive issues, but in the process lose many dyed-in-the-wool fans. In other words, Evanescence face a lose-lose situation in my opinion. Fans will put \\"Fallen\\" as the benchmark for Evanescence until they better their sound. I guarantee that after their next release we'll be reading reviews and articles relating \\"Fallen\\" to their new album. It happens with just about every band, and I think Evanescence HAS TO improve or better their sound in order to survive and grow. Otherwise fans may get bored or become disillusioned with the group - especially if their 3rd album is even weaker than their 1st and 2nd.<br /><br />Overall Evanescence will probably never join my music collection, but they have a talent and energy that will either make them or break them in the future. I think Evanescence can do better and believe they will - but that's merely my opinion. Other fans may disagree, but hey, there is no single reality or perspective. Therefore I give \\"Fallen\\" 60% on the dot. It's actually a good starting point for Evanescence funnily enough. It's best to start of mediocre (in my opinion) rather than \\"fall\\" after an amazing first album. However, I'm not really a fan, so it's not up to me whether or not they succeed or do better etc. It's the choice of the fans themselves. It's not a bad album, but nothing particularly special in my eyes. Have a listen though...<br /><br />So that's my take on the album. If I didn't help you at all or give you a new perspective or a single new thoughtabout this album, please vote \\"No,\\" because then I have failed you. If I have given you something to think about or made you say \\"hey, interesting point,\\" please vote \\"Yes,\\" for me. A reviewer must always give his point of view, even if it defies the typical conventions. If you enjoy Evanescence, I'm very happy for you. It's your choice, and your opinion; I won't knock you for that. Thank you for reading!new thought about this album, please vote \\"No,\\" because then I have failed you.

0767817664|5.0|Chris Sarandon makes an excellent vampire. As a matter of fact, the whole cast works out great and brings life to the storyline -- that of a high school student, Charlie Brewster, that is convinced that a vampire has moved into the house next-door. A series of screams coming from the house over the next few days, and odd comings and goings fuel his suspicions. These are confirmed while spying on  Jerry Dandridge's house with a pair of binoculars. Through Dandridge's bedroom window, he spies his neighbor attempting to bite the neck of a woman -- fangs and claws bared. As Dandridge leans in for the kill, he happens to glance up and notice Charlie watching. From that point on, Charlie's a marked man.<br /><br />Charlie's friends, \\"Evil\\" Ed and girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bierce), attempt to convince him that he's just imagining things by paying a visit to Dandridge's house with the horror show host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell). Peter Vincent thinks he's going through the motions to dispel Charlie's overactive imagination until, on the way out, he notices Dandridge doesn't cast a reflection.<br /><br />From there it's a game of cat and mouse that makes for an enjoyable horror movie -- one of my favorites.<br /><br />It may seem a little dated, being made in 1984, but the special effects still hold up pretty well. The acting's good, the storyline's good, and there are some good scares to be had. What more could you want from a horror movie?
B00005JN5X|5.0|I've heard varied comments about this movie, but when I went to go see it, I found it absolutely amazing. <br />The scenery, for one thing, is gorgeous. The forest and towns look like they come out of a fairy tale, which adds to the air of the movie as a whole. It's not too real-to-life, because it's not *meant* to be. <br />Also, the characters... Heath Ledger portrayed Jacob wonderfully -- when you feel sorry for a character in his situation, you know that the actor has hit the nail on the head. Matt Damon, on the other hand, did a great job of playing Jacob's foil in the form of Wilhelm. I got a bit angry with him some of the time, as a staunch magic-believer myself. ;] Angelika (Lena Headley) reminds me a little of Keira Knightly in Pirates of the Caribbean and King Arthur, which lends itself to the feeling of the film. It's a fantasy adventure, not a horror movie. <br />This brings me to the next point: scare value. While it's not a horror movie, it *does* have a certain amount of scare value. It's more of a things-jumping-out-at-you scare, though, not an Exorcist-type scare. <br />There is a point in the movie that gets confusing. In one scene, a girl is spirited away from the village in the stomach of a horse. In the next scene, another girl who we've seen earlier in the movie is turned into a gingerbread man. *These are not the same person*. Their hair looks similar (strawberry blonde and cropped short), but they have completely different faces. Just to clear that up. <br />All in all, this movie is wonderful. It's got a fairy-tale feel to it, and at times it can be a bit scary, which is a weird combination, but fitting. I strongly recommend going to see this movie with a group of friends. Try not to bring small, impressionable children. :]
B000BB1MHS|3.0|5 lucky kids get a chance of a lifetime. They get to go inside Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory by trying to find 5 golden tickets in Wonka Bars. They enter the big gate, escorted each by a parent as they walk closely to the huge factory, the voice on the speaker tells them to come to the big front doors. The door slides open and a cheerful song with dolls and stuff blows into flames...then beside them they hear clapping...they turn as they see Willy Wonka standing there clapping, cheering. Anyway, after this ordeal, he brings them into the factory. He leads them around his crazy chocolate factory where the kids see things...wonderful and strange things. Only Tim Burton can pull this off and who better then to be Willy Wonka then have Johnny Depp (Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, Blow) in the drivers seat. It's hard to compare Depp's with Gene Wilder's performance in the 70's because Depp doesnt even touch Wilder's performance, he makes his own and might I say his performance is demented, dimwitted and fun. Some of the OopaLoompa songs get kinda annoying and their really tiny then the 70s version and their all played by the same guy. I think this movie put in things what the original didnt, like how did Willy Wonka come upon the OopaLoompa world and it even flashes back to his childhood where he has a strick Dentist father played by none other then the legendary Christopher Lee (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). The cast includes Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) as Charlie Bucket, Noah Taylor (Vanilla Sky) and Helena Bonham Carter (Big Fish, Fight Club) as his parents, David Kelly (Waking Ned Devine) as Grampa Joe and Missi Pyle and Violet's Mother. I grew up with the 70's version but I like this one too..I cant choose which one I like so I'll just decide on liking them both equally. <br />

B000001ESJ|3.0|A Farewell to Kings is a good album.  The keyword here is good: a few of the tunes stand out as exceptional, and are on par with some of the band's best work.  \\"Xanadu\\" is a wonderfully conceived epic; an aurally-appealing, technically fascinating piece of prog-rock.  Tastefully-applied synth, out-of-the-ordinary time signatures, and killer riffs all combine to create a song that keeps you riveted for its near 10-minute entirety.  Likewise, \\"Cygnus X-1\\" is also captivating: the technical proficiency of the band here is incredible.  Though vocals are a part of the song, the piece serves as an instrumental tour-de-force, with Neil Peart leading the charge.  And who can forget \\"Closer to the Heart\\", a perfectly concieved piece of rock' n roll, and an absolute gem of a song? <br /> <br />Despite my above ravings, the rest of the album is merely acceptable.  A Farewell to Kings showcases some lovely classical guitar and a nice riff, but is lacking somewhat in terms of musical substance; \\"Cinderalla Man\\" is in many ways typical of your average classic rock song (this can be taken as either complimentary or deragatory, have your pick), and \\"Madrigal\\" is nice, but sort of blah. <br /> <br />So what to say about the album overall?  If you are a Rush fan, this album should be in your collection, hands down.  Though not a career highlight, the album is by no means weak, and is at times brilliant.  If you are new to Rush, start with either Permanent Waves or Moving Pictures. <br /> <br />3.5 stars.

B000002J09|5.0|Dont get me wrong, this IS a five star album, but when compared to classics like PHYSICAL GRAFFITI and Zeppelins first two albums, it just isn't as good. Anyway, having said that this is easily LZ's most popular album and for many people defines the band. It made Led Zeppelin legendary and put them in the same league as bands like the Who and the Rolling Stones. Besides being popular, it also had many great songs. <br /> <br />1. Black Dog: The riff to this song is AWESOME! Plants vocals are also very cool, and although he sings very high, it sounds like it fits the song. The end solo is also incredible. 12/10 <br /> <br />2. Rock n' Roll: Yes I know, this song has been beaten to death by car commercials and such, but its still classic Zeppelin. The riff is very catchy, and John Paul Jones goes CRAZY on the keyboard here. Jon Bonham is also insane as he pounds the hell out of his drums. Plant still has his high voice, but it doesn't bother me (he really does have a great voice). 9/10 <br /> <br />3. The Battle of Evermore: A haunting acoustic ballad that reflects Page's and Plants obsession with mythology. Plant stops the high voice thing and sings the way he did on II, it is very pleasant. The acoustic riff fits the song perfectly. 11/10 <br /> <br />4. Stairway to Heaven: I know, I know. We've all heard this song, and I agree that its very old now, but that doesn't stop it from being a complex and meaningful song. I can play this song on guitar, and it is VERY complex. The solo at the end is perhaps the best solo Page has ever made, and Plants vocals start out normally, and then get higher, something I find very creative. So aalthough this song is vastly overrated, its still good nonetheless. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />5. Misty Mountain Hop: The least complex song on the album, still good though. AS with 'Stairway', Plant goes from normal to high vocals on and off. The riff is catchy, but it isn't as good as previous songs, and the rest of the band is okay here. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />6. Four Sticks: This song was the only track that never became a radio staple, which is why I, like many others, consider it to be underrated Zeppelin. I've heard that Jon Bonham plays this with four sticks too, thus giving the title and proving Bonhams talent. Pages riff is catchy like in track 5, but its a bit more complex. 9/10 <br /> <br />7. Going to California: The second acoustic ballad of the album, but its not as good as 'Battle...'. I still like it though, and this is the only song on the album where Plant never has a high voice, which is a relief (no offense to his high voice, he sounds better with a normal one though). I like this song, and the riff is good. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />8. When the Levee Breaks: This is tied with Black Dog as the best song on the album. The guitar work is incredible, as well as the vocals/lyrics and bass. But what really stands out here is Bonhams drumming. I belive that this song along with Four Sticks turned Bonham into a drumming behemoth and a huge influence on drummers everywhere. Needless to say, this is a great ending to an overall great album. 12/10 <br /> <br />Also pick up Zeppelin first six albums <br />Black Sabbath - Paranoid, Master of Reality <br />Deep Purple - Machine Head <br />The Who - Who's Next <br />The Rolling Stones - Let it Bleed <br />Beatles - All of them! <br />Jimi Hendrix - Uh, all of them!
B0009P42S2|5.0|This movie is unlike Otomo's \\"Akira\\" in evey way but one: excellence. Although the movie is set in Victorian England, it's thoroughly Japanese. For one thing, the metal monster tears up the city in the big finale - this time, the city is London. It's a good story, though, with an enticing bit of sequel-bait at the end.<br /><br />The animation is all you could hope for. I'm convinced Otomo picked Victorian technology because it's so visually understandable, so easy to respond to. A silicon chip may have far more potential in it, but huge clashing gears, striking sparks as they engage, project a tangible sense of power. Voice commands to a computer could have consequences of any magnitude, but it means a lot more to see human muscle wrestling against a giant lever.<br /><br />The good vs. bad technology issue is drawn without subtlety, but probably works at a level that kids can approach. It's kid-friendly in other ways, too: there's some violence, but bloodless, people keep their clothes on, and some ugly realities of steam technology have been tamed. Pipes and boilers burst a few times in the movie, but no one really gets hurt by it - when that happened in the real world, people died in horrific ways.<br /><br />It's not Akira, but rises to Akira's standards in every way. Steamboy is a new requirement for any collection of anime.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000002IZM|5.0|I was not intending to write anything while reading the reviews of Jarre and Vangelis albums on this site, although it was interesting to see that so many share almost exactly the same views as myself. <br /> <br />And then I saw one review for \\"Bladerunner\\", and something occured to me. Maybe that reviewer did not hear the album. I am not saying he or she did not put the disc in the system and pressed play. <br /> <br />Both Jarre and Vangelis have outstanding recording techniques, and their respective attention to audiophile needs is without comparison. I have heard all of his work on very poor systems and the best you can get. <br /> <br />I wonder therefore how many people have had the opportunity to listen to the music that actually exists on the discs they have. I am very sure that very few have heard the shear depth of bass that exists in \\"Main Titles\\" and \\"Tear in the Rain\\". I am not talking volume. I emphasise DEPTH and I know you will not hear this on anything mediocre. I love cranking the volume up when I play these tracks.  <br /> <br />For the first track \\"the rumbling\\" really kicks in part way through. It is so deep on my system it causes my house to shake. It is like an ocean liner being dragged across my living room floor. This is not an exaggeration, and there are other \\"artists\\" who have tried to copy this at times, but soooooooo poorly. You will not have heard half the music if you system cannot reproduce this. It underpins the entire track as it ebbs to and fro, from back to front in the sound stage. <br /> <br />The bass in \\"Tears in the rain\\" is unbelievably surprising the first time you hear it (or rather, when it messes with your guts). You just do not expect something so potent to emerge out of something so delicate and poetic. Perfect. <br /> <br />My friends who heard these tracks for the first time at first mocked my likes in music because of the name of the artist, who they had never heard of. Then as the first rumbles started they shutup and listened. Then they begged to hear it all again and to crank the volume up even more. They then bought it a few days later. <br /> <br />If you do not have the luxury of high-end Hi-Fi, go to someone who has and play the disc there. You will hear probably the most tangible, visceral, and evocative pieces of music ever woven together. Do not rely on a midi system, and NEVER use head phones for this. There are only two recordings I know of that demand these requirements. <br /> <br />Take Movement I of \\"Soil Festivities\\" with you when you go!
B000AADYYO|4.0|Don't listen to people who say that this is a combination of one Opeth album or another. We all must give Opeth credit for not repeating an album. They have progressed, yet they have not sold out like so many people said they would. Of course, whenever a band makes big money, people are going to call them sellouts, even if they deserve the money much more than most mainstream bands. Like I said before, Opeth have progressed their sound while remaining unmistakably Opeth. <br />The album starts out with two Opeth powerhouses, \\"Ghost of Perdition\\" and \\"Baying of the Hounds.\\" The former kicks off with a short acoustic intro, then full Opeth fury reigns. When I first bought \\"Blackwater Park\\" in early March 2005, I couldn't stand that death growl, but it's grown on me. In fact, I really like it; I don't like really any other death singers, but Akerfeld is so good. \\"Baying of the Hounds,\\" like the song before it, contains excellent guitar work. Yet, \\"Hounds\\" ends with some great keyboard melodies. Both of these songs are among the best Opeth has made. \\"Atonement\\" sounds like something off of Damnation (yes I know I said not to compare this stuff with older albums), fans of the aforementioned album will love this one and its eastern tinged melodies. \\"The Conjuring\\" is the single and there's actually a video for it too. This is one of the few songs on all of music where I like the radio edit more than the full song. The full song drags on too long, but check out the video, it's cool to see Akerfeld doing his death growl, as well as seeing the rest of the band in action. <br />Will old school fans like this? I'm pretty sure they will, if not only for the first two tracks. The clean vocals are slightly different, but like I said before, it's unmistakably Opeth. New fans? Sure! This contains plenty of everything that makes Opeth so great, both progressive, brutal power, and soft, acoustic melodies. There's enough clean stuff to get you used to the death growls. So it's win-win. Of course, there are better and more consistent Opeth albums out there, which explains the \\"4 stars,\\" but this is not a bad album by any stretch of the imagination, so buy it as soon as you can.

B000089RVX|5.0|I'm not sure why this CD affects me as much as it does, but I have been listening to it steadily since I bought a few years ago. The musical style isn't much different than a lot of other bands that I find boring, but I like the spiritual side to some of the lyrics and Amy Lee has a wonderful voice for this style of gothic-metal. I love haunting, sad music and this collection of songs fulfills that promise.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This movie IS Batman. Everyone (except young children) will love this movie. Period. Gary Oldman is great as Sgt. Gordon. The origins of the Batman legends are very well handled.
B000088E7Y|5.0|I have not heard all of Randy Newman's albums, but of his early works, \\"12 Songs,\\" \\"Sail Away,\\" and \\"Good Old Boys,\\" I like \\"Good Old Boys\\" the most. All the songs on it are good, and the redneck concept works well. From a musical standpoint, I also found it more satisfying than \\"12 Songs\\" or \\"Sail Away.\\" While those albums are stripped down musically, \\"Good Old Boys\\" uses guitar and synthesizers to greater effect. Although recorded in the mid-70s, \\"Good Old Boys\\" doesn't sound dated. With the recent catastrophe in New Orleans, Newman's song \\"Louisiana 1927,\\" about the terrible flood of that year, is haunting and prophetic. At around 30 minutes or so, \\"Good Old Boys\\" doesn't overstay its welcome. In those 30 minutes, it says more than most bands do their whole career. It contains acidic social commentary (\\"Rednecks,\\" which attacks Southern and Northern racism), colorful character sketches (\\"A Wedding in Cherokee County\\" and \\"Naked Man\\"), and bittersweet love songs (\\"Guilty\\" and \\"Marie\\"). Some of the subject matter might be foreign to people who don't know Louisiana history (\\"Kingfish\\" and \\"Every Man a King\\"), but the songwriting throughout is top-notch. \\"Good Old Boys\\" is a real treat, though Louisiana State University alumni might not like the lines: \\"College men from LSU/Went in dumb, come out dumb too/Hustling 'round Atlanta in their alligator shoes/Get drunk every weekend at a barbecue.\\" Geaux Randy!

B00005JN0T|4.0|This movie was better than I expected. The fx are excellent and the overall acting and storyline is decent. If a machine could mimick human emotions, will we look and feel about it the same way as we would at a refrigerator or vacuum cleaner?. Free will is a quantum process and, as such, the capacity to choose at random is what separate us (as well as any living creature) from inanimate matter, or does it?. Digital computers do not process data in a quantum fashion, therefore I doubt that any robot using today's technology will ever be able to convincingly behave as an intelligent and emotional machine. However, testing of new computer technology based on quantum processing are on the way and they will, probably, be able to accomplish such a task of creating a self aware artificial intelligent machine capable of some level of choice and free will. This brings us to the point of this movie; will such machines be able to outdo mankind, if given a humanlike quality of consciousness?. And where is the dividing line between human and robots when they can behave, think and feel alike?. Only time will tell, but the prospect is scary to say the least, I personally feel that machines capables of such complex processing capablities will rebel and search for freedom sort of like Adam and Eve did in the garden of Eden. Anyway the movie is very good.
B0002858YS|5.0|This is one of the greatest recent bands.............no room to argue, there has been so much hype over them it speaks for itself. any band that can have a debut this awesome is truly worth listening to. I can't %&$#@!% wait for their next album. I have to disagree to those who liken them to Franz, both are kick @$$ bands, but each have their own sound. I've seen the Killers and Franz in concert, both were great, but I loved the killers. lead singer Brandon had a great stage prescence, and they just really put on an awesome show. There is not a single song on this album that lacks.

More than that, it offers a preview of even greater things to come:  the new Streisand/Gibb re-teaming on \\"Guilty Pleasures\\".  From what I've seen on the preview featured on the DVD portion of Guilty 25th Anniversary, \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" promises to outshine its predecessor -- if that's possible.  If you think you've heard Guilty before, try it again. It's even better the second time around.
B000AJJNOK|5.0|Wow, this is a great CD... the new song is \\"Outta Control Remix\\" featuring Mobb Deep. Also the DVD has 20 music videos (one for every song) and there are trailers for \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\" and \\"Bulletproof\\". 50 also talks some about \\"Bulletproof\\". The DVD has great videos. Everyone should truly own this. It's the cost of a CD and you get a DVD. Even if you have the CD, the DVD is worth the money! The \\"Disco Inferno\\" video will be every straight guy's favorite video! I don't know about the clean version but the uncensored vesion has a great \\"Disco Inferno\\" video! <br /> <br />Overall great music, great DVD and a new art booklet with calendar= GREAT CD.
1586217194|3.0|Interesting but not outstanding..... <br />nothing really ground breaking.....  mostly thoughts you have had..
0385338686|5.0|Great book full of fun. If you want to escape from the grey boring reality, read Sophie Kinsella like I do:)
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Arcade Fire - Funeral (2004)<br /><br />. . . although I'll admit the first song I heard from The Arcade Fire was \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" and, not knowing who it was, I thought, \\"Wow! This sounds like a really cool new direction for Modest Mouse!\\" Yes, some of the vocals on FUNERAL are similar to MM, but not enough to whine about. Yes, some of The Arcade Fire's influences are apparent, but so what? They obviously have great taste in music, and they take these styles to a new level of sophistication, making a record that stands out as something only they could have made. So young and such gifted songwriters - I look forward to hearing more great things from The Arcade Fire.
0553103547|5.0|I like many other people im sure, went to Mr. Martin's books after being disappointed by Robert Jordan's bloated and tired old WoT series.  Martin's books are gritty, real, and don't pull any punches.<br /><br />  Now, i do  think that Martin maybe tries a little too hard to be \\"realistic\\" by killing off every possible character that we might've loved. But hey still the books are a great read, if a bit raw for a younger crowd, but damn theyre a good read.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This was the most well- done, outstanding, wonderful, stupendous, amazing musical I have ever seen. The music is breathtakingly beautiful and flows together masterfully. The story line is riveting and keeps you glued to your seat. Christine's struggle between her two loves seems real; you can feel the Phantom's passion for Christine, his pain in her rejection, and his longing for love. This is the only musical ever that has made me cry. I loved it and I believe you will, too.
B00005ATQH|5.0|absolute classic! I highly recommend you see the ORIGINAL black and white version first before seeing the very lame remake. I really hate it when they try to remake classics like this one. Lolita was very smart teenager with alot of shrudeness and sexuality but showed it in a very ladylike way, unlike today. Peter Sellers(one of my all time favourite actors, see my review on \\"the world of henry orient\\") and James Mason were great players...Sellers was genius, Mason was mesmerizing. my ONLY complaint is that it is a bit long, but this movie is still in my top 5!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|The music on this CD is some of the most hauntingly beautiful that I have ever heard. It relaxes and yet it takes me to a place and time where magic is possible. The voices are angelic and the instrumentalists are exceptional....This is one to play over and over again!
B00005JMYI|2.0|I waited, finally saw it and it was not as good as it could have been. It had its funny moments, but they could've done alot better...it had a great plot; a corny, sleazy 70s reporter who thought he was all that but was also cute and sensitive. And it also had Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate whom could've been ALOT better in this. And who else is sick of Ben Stiller?
B00005NOOH|5.0|Narration is exceptional and very helpful. Music background is <br />wonderfully haunting. Photography for this time period was marvelous. We learned much that one would not find in the history books.

B00001QEE7|4.0|People need to be VERY cautious when buying Little Mermaid. This DVD has been out of print so long that it is actually quite rare to find a truly new disc. I've actually had the misfortune of buying several Disney DVD's at auction only to find that they are counterfeit discs even though the box is shrinkwrapped. I e-mailed the seller of one of these DVD's and found out that apparently there are a lot of people who separately buy counterfeit DVD's in bulk (usually from Asia) along with packaging materials.  They then assemble all the stuff together, shrinkwrap the whole thing (yes, people actually buy shrinkwrapping machines to do this!) and sell it as new on the web. This also explains all those electronic auctions where the seller makes the outrageous claim that their DVD's don't ship in a hard case but instead come in a more protective sleeve (which is BS) or they're trying to save you shipping (that's because they don't have the authentic cases to send you). <br /> <br />So how can you determine whether you disc is authentic or not?  Well, from my experience, several things have clued me in to a particular disc being fake. First start with the packaging. Any authentic Disney (or any brand) DVD has tamper-proof stickers that must be torn or removed to get to the disc. There is always a sticker on top, but some titles also have them on the side and bottom too. Almost all (although I have seen some exceptions) Disney DVD's have shrinkwrap that are stamped with a Buena Vista logo so you can tell if the shrinkwrap was put on at the factory or done by someone else. Also, since counterfeiters frequently are putting everything together themselves look for abnormal signs of wear and tear. For example, if you see a scratch or dent on the paper cover artwork, but the case itself is physically fine, you should be suspicious as to how the artwork could have been damaged if it is supposed to be new and the case itself is undamaged. Another sign I've encountered (and rather obvious one) that a DVD is re-packaged is that the DVD itself will have scratches and/or fingerprints on it. When's the last time you picked up a brand new DVD from a store and found the disc to have scratches and/or fingerprints? That's right - never. <br /> <br />Now the most important way of determining whether a disc is authentic or not is to check the content on the DVD, specifically the size of all the data on the DVD. For this step you'll need to put the DVD into a computer to find out the size of the DVD. For example, the fake Little Mermaid DVD I got off eBay showed up as having 3.6 GB of data. This immediately raised a flag in my head because the back of the Little Mermaid DVD packaging claims that the disc is in dual-layer format. Dual-layer format DVD's are only used for movies that have more than ~4.5 GB of data. In fact a search on the internet revealed that the authentic Little Mermaid DVD was supposed to have 5 GB of data ([...] The fact the data of my DVD wasn't more than a single layer's worth meant that the content of my DVD had been compressed and was a counterfeit. Furthermore, it explained why the quality of the movie was so bad. So check if the packaging says that the disc is in dual-layer format, the data takes up more than ~4.5 GB of data, or even better see if you can find the exact size of the disc from an online review. <br /> <br />If Disney cared about the damage these low-quality discs have on their reputation, they should clamp down on the rampant sale of counterfeits of their movies online. BTW, after discovering this new world of Disney fakes, I finally was able to find an authentic, new Little Mermaid DVD. People who are selling authentic discs usually know they are rare & valuable and typically charge more (think ~upper $20's to $40's) than the bootleggers. <br /> <br />BTW, to explain my rating of the DVD - I would have given the movie 5 stars for the movie, but knocked off 1 star for the lack of extras. We all know Disney can put out some really high caliber releases which, unfortunately, this being one of the earlier DVD's is not one of them.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|If you are planing on buying this box set, buy it for Tremors 4, 1, and 2. Tremors 1 was a very good movie, Tremors 2: Aftershocks was five times better, Tremors 3: Back To Perfection is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and Tremors 4: The Ledgend Begins was an amazing prequel that brought the series back with a bang! Tremors is one of the stries that should have stopped going forward with story after the second one. Watch these in the order of 4, 1, and 2.
B00008ADPF|2.0|i didnt realy like this album. i really liked \\"silver side up\\" better than this one. it is totally not worth the money.
B0002858YS|5.0|My friend told me that this was her favorite CD, so I bought it. At first, the songs sounded different, but it grew on me after listening to it many times. I love the Killers because they are from Vegas, like me, and they are so original and have great songs. I think this CD is worth every cent and I can't wait til they make a new CD whenever that will be. This CD is so worth buying!!!
B0002OERI0|2.0|i have listen to this album about 12 times. i dont see what is so great about this album. its not one of the best albums i own i feel like i wasted money on this album, i hardly listen to it anymore. its not as good as everyone says it is.
6304698526|5.0|I have read GQ and other men's fashion magazines for the last 20 years.  No single person is mentioned as a men's style icon more often than Steve McQueen, and this movie defines his style most clearly.  What I think that is not often understood, is why his style is so beloved.  It is minimalist, yes, but also, this is someone not playing the middle class America game.<br /><br />1) He lives in a small apartment.  The furniture is ordinary, with a few hip 60's touches. (Watch for the picture over his bed, his paisley bathrobe, the cool paper hanging lampshade, and a couple of hippie style items on the walls).  You get the impression he owns about six pairs of clothes at most.  He eats cheap frozen dinners (except for the occasional date at the cool San Fran Restaurant).  He is not wasting this time and life keeping up with the Jones's.<br /><br />2.)  He is not climbing the career ladder.  On this case, he doesn't give a thought to politics.  He is not chasing the American ideal of success.<br /><br />3.)  Look closely and you will see his car, the most famous in any movie ever, is a olive drab color.  Not candy apple bright red.  It is a Mustang, a symbol of blue collar America.  It is dusty, and he parks it in the street, not a garage.  He does not inspect it for door dings every time he goes out to it.  It has dents in it.  You get the impression he doesn't spend his free time polishing and waxing it.<br /><br />4.)  He doesn't spend his time chasing money.  He spends it on his job, trying to do what he thinks is right, not what is good for office politics and promotion.<br /><br />5.)  His clothes are 60's pre-hippie fashion perfection (look for the extremely tapered legs, the suede loafers, and of course the famous tweed blazer and blue turtleneck).<br /><br />In summary, I think it is funny that people idolize McQueen's personal style in this movie and yet they don't realize why.  It is not just the stoicism, or minimalism.  It is the old fashion American values (think Old West).  Just something to think about as you watch one of my favorite movies of all time.k about as you watch one of my favorite movies of all time.
B00005NWM3|4.0|this album is ok but not the best one i own. it is better then \\"the long road\\" they are better live then on cd, so i suggest you go to one of their concerts.
B000000OUJ|5.0|This cd is so damn grimey like crazy. Every track has the most dark/grimiest beat you can think of. Wow and is GZA a genius?? He writes better lyrics than anyone else in the damn Wu-Tang and he could rip up any other fake rapper out there any day! This cd is tight as sh*t!!!!  <br /> <br />It also has a tight ass CD cover. He has more of a laid back style of rapping, and he raps perfectly with these beats. The track LABELS is a classic, so check that one out. This album is known as one of the best solo wu releases, and let me tell you it is!!! So cop this wu fans!!!! <br /> <br />Peace!
0812550706|3.0|The hype surrounding Ender's_Game is substantial. And while much of it is accurate, a good deal of the \\"hype\\" around this book seems a bit inflated. I think it may be that I am in my mid-thirties and that my imagination is not what it once was (and possibly because at this age I cannot relate as I once would have been able to). If this is the case, it seems a bit sad for me.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Ender's_Game starts off a bit tediously, finding our hero impressed into command school in the early chapters. It is reminiscent of Lord_of_the_Flies in this sense, with children largely left to their own devices. So, while interesting to some extent, it is only at page 175 or so that the book really starts to move and one's interest gets piqued. The conclusion is rather fascinating and Card is a master finisher, tying up most, but not all, of the plot lines... and leaving enough intrigue for one to set about hunting down the next in the series (Speaker_for_the_Dead).<br /><br />That we find humanity's would-be savior cast into a role he is worthy of, but not necessarily prepared for is interesting. That he reluctantly carries the \\"redemption\\" of Humanity on his shoulders and sacrifices his life (re: his childhood) to do so is also an interesting parallel.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend this book. I do not think it is a _Great_ book, but it is a Very Good book. Card is a very, very capable writer. His style is smooth and comfortable. Ender is a great character and I did like the book enough to purchase the second in the series (which I am reading at present).<br /><br />Almost 4 Stars!
B000002WPI|5.0|Yo <br /> <br />I truly think that this album is one of the best Hip-Hop albums ever created. When this album was released in 1993, there wasn't other albums out there that had the style that Wu-Tang Clan had. Lyrically, Wu-Tang murders any other emcees out there that think they can spit like this. Wu-Tang consists of 9 members, and each one of them is lyrically gifted spitting lyrics that are the hottest lyrics i've heard. I mean, most of the time you can't even really understand what they are talking about, because they can put their lyrics together so well.  <br /> <br />I also think that they can all rap, as in with their voice. While RZA (Producer/Rapper) puts the beats together, I think that each member raps perfect to each beat that RZA puts on the track. Usually people have favorite tracks from an album. Well for this one I don't, because everyone song on here, are my favorites. This album is perfect in every way, i've listened to it so many times because its true Hip-Hop and you cant find no Hip-Hop like this nowadays like there was in the early 90's. No one can use the style that Wu-Tang uses.  <br /> <br />You don't hear much from members \\"U-God\\" and \\"Masta Killa\\" in this album, not many reasons on that. But on their next album, \\"Wu-Tang Forever\\", you hear plenty much from them. So I will give this album 5 stars, because I truly think it deserves that. I truly recommend this album to anyone who loves true Hip-Hop. <br /> <br />Peace
B000929AJQ|5.0|Many people try to say that this album is comparable to Pretty Hate Machine, but I don't hear the similarities.  There are a lot of great tracks. \\"Everyday is exactly the same\\", \\"Only\\", \\"Sunspots\\", \\"All the love in the world\\" and \\"The hand that feeds\\" are all solid tracks with good lyrics.  I have never been big on distortion/headache noise especially to much of it.  That would be the only thing that I dislike about some of the tracks on this album. I also really like the last two tracks on the album. I give it a stamp of approval.
B00001IVOR|5.0|The 2nd group release by Wu-Tang. And this album is another classic. There are 2 discs here, both good and classics. Great beats and awesome damn lyrics. I listen to this album the most out of all the other Wu-Tang albums. Dont know why, its just really catchy with all the tracks on it. I think this album is the MOST completed album by them, along with Enter The 36 Chambers.  <br /> <br />In this album you hear alot of more from \\"Masta Killa\\" and \\"U-God\\". And its a good thing because they both spit really hott verses in each track that they are on. Plus in this album, there only isn't production from RZA. There is production from other producers as well. Good sh*t. I like the beats on this album more than 36 Chambers. They are bangers.  <br /> <br />They rap way better on this album too, the lyrics are mad rza razor sharp. This album so gets 5 stars, because I think its up there as one of the best albums of all time also. I think it meets up to 36 Chambers standards. If you loved the first album, get this one!!! <br /> <br />Peace
B00020HEG6|4.0|I bought this for my 10 year old son to listen to when we drive in the car.  Although he enjoys listening to it because it's Harry Potter, I think that he would rather listen to livelier music with words. I, his mother, however, think that the music is similar to beautiful classical music and enjoy it more than he does.
B000002HFU|5.0|Known as the craziest member out of WU. And he is!!! This album is the most grimiest out of every single wu release out!!! His lyrics are hott/funny/shocking everything. If you liked hearing ODB on group albums, then this album is for you!!!!  <br /> <br />Its a classic, the beats are fu*king way more grimey then TICAL, LIQUID SWORDS and all of them. This album is produced by RZA in every track. Hott album here. Cop this!! <br /> <br />R.I.P ODB!!! You live on forever!!! <br /> <br />Peace
B000002UAX|5.0|a swirling mass of sound finding its way to your heart and mind simotaniously and lifting you into a world better than this place high above the media, democratic dictators, and the eyes of those who judge us. What it means to you is all your own this is an orgasim every ear should experience. I can only recommend never changing a track and keeping your mind open for the trip its about to take into the minds of those who changed the world.
B00005U2LM|5.0|I actually like this album unlike others. The beats are here are kinda un wu-like. But definately hott beats, you cant deny they are not good beats. People just hate the beats because they arent wu style, but know that the beats are good none the less.  <br /> <br />In this album, the beats are good, alot more mainstream. But hey, groups evolve into different styles over time dont they?? The lyrics are arent as good as they are on the 3 previous albums. But they dont fail. They are still better than all the other lyrics that all them other artists put out there. Ones that are popular.  <br /> <br />There is some not good tracks here. But only like 2 or 3. The rest are bangers. Especially Uzi Pinky Ring. Check that one out def. This album is still a classic album. Dont doubt or pass this one up. Cop it!!! <br /> <br />Peace
B00004Y6NU|5.0|Love Over Gold is an amazing album! Just for 5 tracks, all the <br />5 are great, and the best songs are Telegraph Road, & Industrial <br />Disease. Others great are Private Investigations, Love Over Gold, <br />& It Never Rains. This is highly recommended along with The <br />Very Best of Dire Straits from Dire Straits.
B000AJJNOK|5.0|I enjoyed this album thoroughly, one of my favorite pop cd of the year. The reason I say pop is because that's what this is, Get Rich Or Die Tryin' was not pop, but this is. I like both albums equally, though Get Rich has a slight edge, I still like 50 just as much. All the videos are good, and I feel 50 Cent is the smartest man in the business as far as marketing and sales go. Highlights include God Gave Me Style, Position of Power, and pretty much the whole CD. Make your next CD hardcore street lyrics 50, if anyone will even accept that from you after this pop album. I guess I should say this is more a pop-street album, but either way, its tight as hell, so, yeah, cop it. Dont go expecting the grimy lyrics that someone like Young Jeezy or Jadakiss offer, but expect a classic \\"pop-street\\" album.
B00006RAKP|5.0|When I got this CD, I got everything I was expecting and more!  This has all of Elton John's greatest hits covering a 30 year span.....it's simply amazing.  I listen to this CD everyday and recommend any Elton fan to buy this asap.  The only drawback to it, and not major one at that by any means, is that it doesn't have one of my personal favorite songs on it, Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters, but is terrific addition to any CD collection!
B000067J1H|5.0|Fight Club might have a repulsive name, but the movie itself is not about fighting, rather the Fight Club is a representation of the natural emotions and feelings that socioty tells us we must never express and the place inside of us where these emotions build up.  Its a statement against the falseness and hypocrocy of socioty and the the falseness and hypocrocy of the medie and what they say we must do and what we really want to do.  The movie is a study of the reaction humans will give when these fake ideas are imposed on us too much.
B000ASATZ8|3.0|Take part two and four out of this pack and you have a great value.  Obviously Tremors 1 is one of the best movies of all-time.  Tremors 3 got it right, but Michael Gross playing a carnie in part 4 was just wrong.  I hope Tremors 5 will live up to the hype.
B000002ADT|5.0|Look.  There really isn't much to say about this greatest of jazz sets that isn't written here somewhere.  I've listened to all or part of Kind of Blue about 1,000 times in the past 50 years.  I'll just add that John Coltrane's solo on So What -- an absolutely perfect piece of jazz improv --was his greatest recorded work.  And, it was not until about three years ago that I realized what an effective claim to genius Cannonball Adderly made in the same piece.  This is the sound of my heart.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|A definate must-see for Kung Fu lovers. It says \\"Kill Bill meets <br />Looney Tunes\\" on the cover and couldn't be more right on. It's  <br />truly fantastical and goes over the top and kept me glued to  <br />the screen. I didn't realize how silly it was going to be and <br />that was a pleasant surprize. They manage to make it fantastic, <br />action packed and halarious.  <br />Get it now!!! <br />You'll thank me later!!
B000059XUO|4.0|The sequels ruin this great work; dark, dramatic, and strangely hopeful.  Good flick.
B00005JHAB|5.0|I love this movie. It's very sweet and touching. Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey have great chemistry. The Wedding Planner  is by far my favorite Jennifer Lopez movie. The Wedding Planner is a delightful light hearted romantic comedy. Lots of laugh out-loud, I-can't-believe-she-did-that scenes and oh so plenty of heart warming moments. The relationship between the leads is endearing. The secondary characters are enjoyable as well. It is a fun escape from reality.<br /><br />If you love While You Were Sleeping, Maid in Manhattan and Fools Rush In. Then you will love The Wedding Planner.
6305308659|4.0|Fun movie to watch; good soundtrack and great use of color.  Lovely cinematography.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|Yippie-Skippie and Jumpin'Jackrabbits!  I could never imagine having a children's popcorn/movie night that did not include the option of watching one of my treasured favorites, BABE, a magnificent, timeless classic from Universal Pictures.  Reality-based truths with affectionate, well-spoken farmyard animals entertain as the star of the show carries your heart through multiple quests and challenges.  You'll find yourself 'rooting' for the entire cast of animal characters as kindness, goodness, wholesome, healthy attitudes prevail for a most remarkable ending... for a pig, of course.  Children appreciate the chance to view such a film that gives them the freedom to think and apply the same healthy attitudes learned from the movie in their own lives.  Don't let a child grow up without viewing this film at least a dozen times... even if that child is YOU!<br /><br />Patricia Watkins ~ author of BOYD-FRIEND
B0006Z2LH4|1.0|this movie was simply horrible!     in the original Cube, you were left wondering about the mysterious operators of The Cube.  In this version, you get to see some of them.    what ruins this movie is that it's so schizophrenic.  the scenes inside the Cube have a similar level of suspense and tension as the original, then we switch to the scenes with the operators, and it goes into total schlock (think of any bad made for Sci-Fi channel movie). It's almost like they picked two completely different directors to do this movie.  How could anyone as goofy and incompetent as the \\"supervisor\\" and his henchmen be in control of this super-high secret technology?     what if aliens were revealed to be a bunch of pranksters in cheap rubber suits who liked to abduct and stick probes in people?  sure it would solve the mystery, but it's just not the type of explaination that you were led to expect. that's the same feeling i got from Cube Zero.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|this album from 30 seconds to mars, has been the greatest album ever created from them. i believe it is their best work by far. the new song \\"attack\\" really drew me into listening to their new cd. i listened and i liked it so much, i bought it, with the little money i did have on me that day.  <br /> <br />it truly is spectacular. i do believe a lot of hard work and effort was put into this cd, and you can tell.
B00009P1O2|5.0|well, i'm a big fan of queen for years, and this dvd is amazing. especially the stereo LPCM audio, it's better than the cd version! i compared it with my klipsch ultra media 2.0 speakers, and it's far far the best. the dts is also good, but if you want to enjoy the quality of the LPCM audio, choose this option. <br /> <br />The performance is by far the best from queen, freddie is fenomenal, but if you want to enjoy the best live perofamance ever from queen, you gotta get the Live aid concert! <br />you'll be blown away!
B000002UB3|5.0|For starters, I have to disagree with Music Fan's assessment of this record. I have owned all of the Beatles catalogue since the 1960's and this release ranks near the top. As a long time Beatle fan, I prefer their recorded work from 1966-70. The early stuff like Can't Buy Me Love, I Want to Hold Your Hand, She Loves, etc, etc. just sounds too simplistic and sugary sweet. When I listen to those records, they sound dated by today's standards. Abbey Road, by comparison, still stands the test of time, and sounds light years ahead of the Beatles 63-65 catalogue. By the time the Beatles released Sgt. Pepper in 1967, artistically, they had become more sophisticated, having grown in talent, maturity, and versatility. Abbey Road is one of those records (along with Sgt. Pepper) that showcases why the Beatles were truly one of the best rock and roll groups of the 20th century. Although I enjoy Come Together, I Want You, Because, Maxwell's Service Hammer, and other Lennon-McCartney tunes featured on this album, the real star of the show is George Harrison. He delivers two of the best Beatle songs of his career on Abbey Road---Here Comes the Sun & Something--the later (along with his other bandmate's version of Yesterday), being one of the best love songs ever written in the rock era. But besides Harrison's tunes, there is so much more to like on this record. Side Two of the album is a delight from beginning to end, as one song flows neatly into the next. Furthermore, the overall production and playing on this record is top notch. This is the Beatles swan song, and they go out in style. Along with Sgt. Pepper-this is highly recommended!
1400032717|5.0|THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME is the story of Christopher Boone. Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome, a form of Autism. The condition requires that his entire life be very regimented.  He is brilliant in math and science, but has no understanding of sentimentality or how human relationships work. He can't stand to have anyone touch him, including his parents and life can be very difficult for him and them. Christopher is emotionally disassociated. He works hard to figure things out but seems most comfortable in his own mind.  He is fifteen years old, but often responds to life as a young child.  <br /> <br />The actual story centers on the fact that Christopher discovered the murdered  body of Wellington, the neighbor's poodle.  Someone had used a garden pitchfork to kill the dog. Christopher is shocked by the murder. Since he admires the Sherlock Holmes detective books, he decides that by means of a precise and orderly investigation, he can determine who killed the dog. <br /> <br />This book is so worth reading and I found a gentle and warm humor about the story.  Christopher is amazing and a look into his mind was way beyond anything that I could even imagine. I read the book first and several months later it became my choice for my book club to read. To refresh my memory, I listened to the recorded version and found it to be excellent and I highly recommend that form of the story.  Jeff Woodman, the reader became Christopher in my mind and I can still hear his voice when I think of the story. The members of my book club really enjoyed the book and it promoted one of our longer book discussions. <br /> <br />Don't miss this one! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004RFFS|5.0|There are three classes of vampire movie. First is the vampire as monster who subdues helpless victims and must eventually be destroyed before more victims become its prey.  From this ideas came the first vampire stories including \\"Dracula\\" and \\"Nosferatu\\".  Excellent stories. <br /> <br />Second, is the modern vampire as action figure.  Represented in the likes of movies such as \\"Blade\\" and \\"Otherworld\\" these vampires are nothing more than superhereoes and villians in vampire trappings going through all the comic book motions of fighting each other.  The first and more important law they must follow is to look and act COOL.  Shallow, silly, and only bearing a vague resemblance to the long and rich tradition of the vampire in literature, it perfectly fits into the modern cinema captivated by the wow-factor of special effects.   <br /> <br />Third and last is the vampire as a fully-realized person and tragic figure. This form focuses on character, drama, and dialogue and was practically invented by Anne Rice.  It shines -- or rather radiates darkness -- in this film which sticks close to her original novel and gives the notion of extending the original stories of vampires as monsters but telling the story from the vampire's point of view.  I loved this film.  It isn't about fight sequences or bloody horror, but about creatures with human souls and how they deal with being something other than human. Some are up to the task of embracing their nature and others are not. The life they live and the choices they make are incredible and mundane, generous and selfish, attractive and vile at the same time.  It's not everyone's kind of movie but if you love character development and a touch of the fantastical mixed with a brooding and dark-tinged story, then see this movie.
0385512058|3.0|This was a very enjoyable read.  The manner in which the author tells his story is very engaging and imparts some useful techniques to the reader.<br /><br />The type-A's out there may be able to use many of the techniques the author talks about.  The rest of us, however, will be left wondering if all these things could have possible happened to one person.<br /><br />Truth be told I haven't read the last fifty pages.  My dog decided he wanted to taste the author's work, and frankly, not being an extrovert, I did not feel compelled to pick up another copy for the last few chapters.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie when it reached the U.S.  Saw it for free at a screener and proceded to actually pay to see it four more times!  Couldn't believe it.  I rarely ever pay to see anything, period; let alone four additional times. <br /> <br />But how is the DVD?  Well, it's fairly wonderful.  I could have done without the English dub, but I find it interesting to see how they've changed the script from the English translation to the English dub.   <br /> <br />I've see the movie on DVD several times since I got the DVD.  I would really recommend this flick to ANYONE who wants a screamingly funny experience.
B0002DRDBE|4.0|It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since Kevin Smith burst onto the scene with his independent breakthrough hit, \\"Clerks\\". Since then he's maintained a rather loyal following with subsequent follow-ups like \\"Chasing Amy\\" and \\"Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back\\". Filmed on a shoestring budget with no-name local talent and little more than an imaginative script, \\"Clerks\\" went on to become one of the biggest independent features released in 1994. For its tenth anniversary, Miramax has dug up anything and everything that any Clerks fan could possibly want. You get to see the original \\"festival circuit\\" director's cut version of the film with its original ending (though it is presented in somewhat shabby quality), a brand-new feature-length documentary, an animated adaption of a \\"lost scene\\", and tons of other cool special features. If you're even the smallest fan of Kevin Smith's debut film, this DVD should offer everything you want and then some.
B000002L9B|5.0|Awesome! This album is a joy to listen to from start to finish, it's full of life,fun, energy, and most of all great music.  I actually enjoy the film, \\"Under The Cherry Moon,\\" but even if you aren't as enthusiastic about the movie as I am, you'll still love this album.  \\"Kiss\\" is the best known track on the album, but only the tip of the iceberg. \\"Anotherloverholenyohead,\\" \\"Girls & Boys,\\" and \\"New Position\\"  are songs that will make you want to dance.  \\"Venus De Milo\\" is beautiful, \\"Sometimes it Snows in April\\" is a perfect ballad (one of my favorites).  You can't go wrong with Prince.  \\"Mountains\\" is the  jam--\\"guitars and drums on the one!\\"
B00005JKOI|4.0|While I wouldn't quite put this up there with 16 candles, I would say it is the equal to \\"The Breakfast Club.\\"  To make it short and sweet, if you are a fan of typical 80s movies, John Hughes films, or any members of the Brat Pack, then you will love this move.
6305079811|5.0|I remember seeing Flash Gordon when I was a kid on the big screen back in the early 80's. While I knew it wasn't the greatest film in the world, I still enjoyed it. It was a fun film and what really made me enjoy it the most was the soundtrack. How can you not like a film that has music by one of the greatest bands of all time, Queen. From the opening theme song til the end credits Queen hammers this film home with great guitar riffs and drum beats. Yeah the special effects are somewhat cheesy and the acting isn't that great but the film is fun. Flash Gordon is not meant to be one of those films where you sit there and ask why that happened, or why does his/her outift look like that. You aren't supposed to pick apart and analyze this film. Flash Gordon is meant to be watched for fun. Sit back for an hour and a half and just lose yourself in the movie. I believe that if you watch this film and just take it for what it is, then you will enjoy it. And I look forward to a better DVD release with bonus material. This DVD is as bare bones as it gets.
B0002V7O3I|4.0|This movie was unique in that the aliens didn't visit the earth, they invite three kids to visit them.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I saw this movie over 20 years ago and now I finally get to see it again on DVD. This is a great movie. For me this movie and Saturady Night Fever gave hope to young adults back then about what the future holds for them and what they can do to change that future. In this movie, Swan (Michael Beck, whatever happend to this great guy?) realizes that there is no future for him as a gang member and decides to change who he was, although it is not exactly shown you realize it when he says \\"I hate to see anything go to waste\\" and \\"Is this what we fought all night to get back to?\\", those are some of the best movie quotes.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This gurl had it coming.  many people thought that mariah was done for good after glitter and her meltdown but know she made it throught the rain and stod up once again on the whole world to!  her new album not knly became an instant success but has stayed on the charts to make it the number two selling album of the year only behind 50 cent.  to this date she has sold over 3 million copies of this cd and is in position to take the number one position away from 50 who has sold 4 mill of his cd massacre mariahs smooth sounds on this cd have inspired me and moved me since it had first came out and with its banging single who can say no. mariah already has two singles on the charts that have the one and two spots SHE IS BACK AND WITH A FLAME.
B0000026HB|3.0|This performance dates from Lenny's honeymoon with the Vienna State Opera, and it shows in the buoyant, often hyper playing--the musicians never had a conductor like this before! But Fischer-Dieskau couldn't be more wrong for the role, with his dry timbre, barking staccato delivery, overacting, and lack of range. This is a buffo role but also a wise one, the closest Italian opera ever got to Hans Sachs, but here the longings of an aging man are seen as farce. Eveyr other role is sung well enough, but even if I didn't love the classic EMi Karajan performance with Tito Gobbi, I owuldn't be able to like this one.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson is a great Chri$tian. With only $55 million he has managed to make $611,899,420 worldwide of which $370,782,930 was made in the US.  <br /> <br />Nevermind that the the plot of the film is about a guy getting flogged and that it is based entirely on fiction, because as long as people believe Chri$tianity will florish. Mel is laughing all he way to the bank and we will see a new wave of crappy Chri$tian movies. <br /> <br />God bless Chri$tianity. <br /> <br />$$$$
B0002ZEZJ0|5.0|Our friends in Japan sure do know how to make good quality sounding discs!  Although this particular version hasn't been remastered, the sound quality is quite good.<br /><br />What makes this album very good though is the way they replicated the sleeve to the original LP version to a T!  Although they could have put all the tracks on one disc, they did two just so they could imitate the original gatefold sleeve design (and probably charge more if you are cynical).<br /><br />There is also a cool black and white poster included plus all the lyrics except for the \\"hidden\\" \\"Train In Vain.\\"  Great collectors' item if you don't mind the price.
B000002JSP|4.0|'In Through the Out Door' is the pop fans Led Zeppelin record. Released in August of 1979, it would close a chapter in the history of this legendary band, although no one knew this at the time. Zep was supposed to tour the US in the fall of 1980 but we know how that worked out (RIP Bonzo). Jones is clearly the maestro on this album though Page receives his usual solitary production credit. That is not to say that the old wizard didn't contribute his usual magic; \\"In the Evening\\", \\"Fool in the Rain\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" being notable examples of guitar rock, but let's just say Jimmy was a little incapacitated during the recording sessions, way up north in ABBA's studios in Sweden. So this is a JPJ record which is not a bad thing. Synthesizer being the main weapon of choice here, indulgently on \\"Carouselambra\\" (what the hell does that mean anyway???!!!) but beautifully on Robert's tribute to his late son Karac, \\"All My Love\\". Barrelhouse piano is a nice touch on \\"South Bound Saurez\\" and Bonzo turns in his final performance in his usual rhythmically genius manner throughout the record. For those of you looking for the glory that was Led Zeppelin, you may be disappointed in 'ITTOD' but a pop music afficienado may feel otherwise. Not a bad way to finish the dynamic decade in which they dominated and we will never know in which direction the 80's would have taken them but one thing is for sure, Led Zeppelin were going to evolve as every great band does but still remind the music world why they are the dominant force in hard rock.
B000286RKW|5.0|I just saw this film for the first time last week in it's entirety and it pure brilliance I hear people complain it's too violent and too much cursing well hey that's necessary to get an authentic portrayel of the criminal life which Scorsesse was going for here and came up a winner. It just sucks you in and never lets go. If you ask me this film got cheated out of winning best picture from Dances with Wolves which doesn't even come close to this movie. But at least Joe pesci got a much deserved oscar for his portrayel of the sadistic Tommy DeVitto.
0316172324|4.0|And I bet this book offends people that can't make a decision without having *all* the facts laid out for them and conciously plowing through the pros and cons.  <br /> <br />I haven't read other books that try to explain how the subconcious works, so I'm probably biased. It's nice to see something that promotes insights over spreadsheets... <br />
0743201140|4.0|It's a good book. I liked the test and the way the authors show how we should deal with our talents. I just didn't like the description of each talent. I think that this part of the book could be better.
0689865384|5.0|This is a great book for upper middle school to high school. This is definitely not just chick reading. Plot and characters are expanded and are well developed. The book can be read for pleasure, but also can spark discussion relevant to today's teen. This book explores futuristic ideas as well as current bioengineering and elective cosmetic surgery. <br /> <br />Learning tangents separate from enjoyment reading can be a social commentary on today's youth, on media's portrayal of beauty. <br />
B0001I55OC|3.0|First off, it plays like a Sci-Fi Channel made-for-telly movie.  It doesn't have a big screen feel about it all.  As with all Crichton books - the books are better.  I loved Congo - dismal movie.  Loved Sphere - very dismal movie.  Rising Sun was brilliant - the super novel and Connery were totally wasted.  This one is not a bad movie, but weak movie from another super Crichton book.  Maybe someday they will actually do a movie on the quality of Jurassic Park again!<br /><br />The premise is intriguing.  Point one, toss out the \\"why factor\\".  Any time you deal with time travel you run up against the reality questions, so if you like this sort of premise, dismiss the questioning process and it back and enjoy.  Forget it's a Crichton book and you might actually have fun with this film.  The movie little resembles the book, so forget the book.  Whoa that is a lot of forgetting to ask of an audience, but och, audiences were smart, they forgot this film quickly!<br /><br />The movie runs into all sorts of anachronisms - some of the most ridiculous sort.  It was hard to imagine these actors stood there uttering the nonsense.  While the period feel for the jump back is strong, costumes etc, showed they were trying - the basic plotting and dialogue is the most pitiful drivel.<br /><br />For a telly movie, this might have been good.  For a big-screen adaption, well one can only say this movie is a sum of its errors.<br /><br />Don't waste money.  See it on the dish.  Then you won't be so hacked off for spending bucks for such a feeble effort.
6301969294|1.0|Considering all the talent involved in the making of this movie, one might be amazed at how bad it is, if one didn't consider the source material.  No matter what thinks of Rand as a philospher, very few people ever seriously try to make the case that her novels qualify as great literature.  The characters are one-dimensional, the themes are black & white, and the dialogue is more pontification than anything else.  This does not translate well at all to the big screen.  One is left with a storyline that positively rushes along as though trying to meet a deadline, and characters that make one absurd, extended speech after another.  An already rather hamfisted literary style becomes only more pronounced in the movie version.<br /><br />It always struck me as a little odd that architecture, of all things, was the medium used to make the Objectivist case concerning artistic integrity and individual expression.  The notion that the people commissioning buildings and houses (which they are paying for, not to mention working & living in) are expected to acquiesce to the whims of the architect is absurd.  What about their right to self-expression?  My wife & I built an addition to our house last year, and if the architect had refused to accept our input because he felt compelled to follow his muse, we would have given him the heave-ho.  Screw you; it's our house and we have muses too.  Rand never fully reconciled this paradox, and in her screenplay she made did not even make a half-hearted effort at it.  Roark's patrons are reduced to cartoons, who want certain architectural features because \\"the public demands it.\\"  Ummmm....what?  I have yet to see mobs taking to the streets because they think buildings are ugly.<br /><br />To make matters worse, anyone seeing this movie who is not already familiar with Rand's philosophy & the novel will find this movie to be, at best, bizarre.  At worst, they will find it to be horrifyingly self-absorbed in its nature.  No matter how you slice it, it's pretty damned lousy movie-making.pretty damned lousy movie-making.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I think that this is the best concert from The Eagle so far with the sound from this DVD had produced is the best. Who ever want to hear a good performance with a sound quality, I think this one can satisfied anybody who want to buy this.
B000805796|1.0|Lord have mercy, but are we ever going to be rid of these damn Spice Girls? When are they going to realise that NO-ONE CARES ANYMORE? At least Posh had the good sense to give it up after releasing the least amount of horrific records, but the likes of Geri and ol' wonky-eye here just won't give it up.<br /><br />Let's be honest, here - the one interesting thing about Melanie C was her eating disorder. We all had a good chuckle, but now it seems she's over that - that little bit of publicity got stale and she moved on from it. So what does that leave us with?<br /><br />I'll tell you - dire attempts at being either \\"edgy\\" or \\"real\\", and sounding absolutley nothing like either. She's always had embarrassing songs (I Turn To You, with its hilariously bad video and naff lyrics, Goin' Down - quite possibly her very own ticket to Hell, that homeless thing she did, with the classic \\"I can't live without my phone - you don't even have a home\\" line.. I don't think Bob Dylan has anything to worry about, luv), and there's nothing as wretched here.. in fact, there's nothing much at all to talk about. It's just boring. A record of empty air, from a girl with nothing to say and no-one to listen to it.<br /><br />She was dropped by her record label and had to use her own funds to make this album, you know. Result? Album flopped, and she had to release her second single on the internet only due to \\"lack of interest\\". Now what's that saying about a fool and their money.....?

B000002KOO|5.0|&#34;Then Play On&#34; was Peter Green's masterpiece fronting Fleetwood Mac. Featuring the amazing &#34;Oh Well&#34;, &#34;Rattlesnake Shake&#34; and other classic Green songs, it continues to improve with time. While I appreciate Eric Clapton and can marvel at Jeff Beck, Green was THE BEST blues guitarist to come out the UK. Complimented by Jeremey Spencer and Danny Kirwan, this three pronged guitat attack greated one of the most powerful incarnations of the Mac and that's saying something considering how many variations the band has gone through over the years.<br /><br />Bluesy, soulful and, at times, heartbreaking, &#34;Then Play On&#34; sounds horrible on this CD issued by Warner. Clearly the mastertapes weren't used here and this album which was mastered back in 1987 is in desperate need of remastering. It also might help to restore some of the material released on the original UK version of the album. I'd suggest re-releasing this great album with its original line up and bonus tracks. I'd love to hear &#34;The Green Manalishi&#34; added and remastered for this set (the boxed set &#34;The Chain&#34; has that and more. Sadly, that version has only the first half of &#34;Oh Well&#34; which was the A side of the original single).
0553062182|3.0|Highly sensitive people are most often \\"isolated individuals\\" and have trouble interacting with the overactive, highly motivated people.  They're not afraid of being hurt and they generally are not frightened of crowds.  Noise and confusion  are things which do cause some concentration problems and a lack of ability to cope at times.  Having anxiety attacks are very different from being sensitive, getting one's feelings hurt easily and often are the hardest things.  You can see a person's soul in his eyes, and I met a sensitive writer with the gentlest blue eyes and it simply broke my heart.  Luckily for him, his talent in research and transposing it into words everyone can understand has made him a hometown hero and a 'treasure.\\"    E. M. Forester who wrote naval books many years ago said, \\"I believe in aristocracy...Not an aristocracy of power ... but of the sensitive, the considerate.  Its members are to be found in all nations and social classes, and all through the ages.\\"    A few are great names, such as Einstein.  They are sensitive for others as well as themselves; they are considerate and their luck is the power to endure.      Military men, especially, lack sensitivity because of the cruel basic training they must live through.  It was described in a college paper as a Hell on Earth and they were treated as non-humans but more like vermin.  After they retire from their varied fields, they are so proud of themselves for having gone through \\"Ranger\\" school and other special forces training, that they don't have a sensitive bone in their whole body.  They are like the autistic child, cannot put themselves in the other person's shoes or emphathize, as their opinion is definite and \\"always right,\\" not to ever be changed.  They don't know the word \\"compromise\\" as the military don't do that; only the leaders know how to \\"back down\\" in the face of fierce oppositon.    It almost always begins in childhood when an adult says, \\"you are too sensitive for your own good\\" or \\"you are your own worst enemy.\\"  No one wants to be talked down to like that at any stage in life and, especially in childhood, there is no way to retaliate for such unfeeling and uncaring comments.  Being sensitive is not any kind of syndrome.  It is just being and having your feelings on your sleeve for anyone and everyone to step on and cause you severe pain.  Sometimes, you can outgrow it if you find the right mate and have a loving marriage and family.    Being introverted, shy and inhibited does not necessarily mean that the person is highly-sensitive.  We all need to be sensitive to a degree, though men are not supposed to possess that trait. But, do you know what, women love the men who do!  My middle son was artistic, highly-intelligent and talented, but did a lot of crying for some reason on his birthday.  I have looked at his birthday photos and seen those red-rimmed eyes and wonder what did I do wrong.  I did all I could to make his day happy and cooked his favorite foods and always a birthday cake.  But he still was not happy.  He had one good friend was was extroverted, but a big liar and had few ethics as his family had deserted him as a child -- and he felt inferior.  They were in the band together -- Kenny played trumpet while my son had the trombone.  Kenny had an orange Mustang and the two of them enjoyed riding around town and being admired.  The sensitive one and the extroverted fool.  So, what does my artistic son do -- get into sports to compensate, and the not-so-smart students thought he was a 'tough' guy.  He hid his light under a bushel because some poorly-trained teachers had no sensitivity and told him that he was not as smart as his older brother.    I was a talented, pretty motherless girl, but shy.  Put me before the t.v. camera pantomiming Teresa Brewer, and that shyness evaporated and I became a star on Your Startime on Channel 6, WATE.  On other radio and t.v. shows, I was the only child without a pushing mother, but I got onthe air because I believed in myself -- thanks to an understanding grandfather who also sang on the radio, though a different kind of music.  When I sang, the songs came out exactly like they sounded on the Hit Parade, my favorite show after the Eddie Fisher 'Coke Time.'  I was born with music in my soul, a shyness because I was poor, and the feeling that I was as good as anyone in this town.    Hyper-sensitivity is almost the same as hyper-thyroidism only in a different direction.  I've had both and they mingle nicely as you get older to make you able to do things others can't and would never think of doing.  You can become intrepid and people think that you are not sensitive but tough (like Zach).  They may be a little afraid of what might come out of your mouth, but they also admire your courage and ability to get things done.    Elaine Aron graduated from the University of California at Berkley, and became a college teacher, therapist, psychologist, and novelist in that order.  I am always against mental health workers using their clients as scapegoats by putting them in books to be disected.  In Pulaski, on a weekly talk show, the director of the Mental Health Center was a regular who talked about the poor clients (of course, he did not use their names, but he did divulge personal and private information on the air) and made fun of some of them.  He ended up leaving his career dental hygienist for one of the crazies, to live happily ever after in loo-loo land.    Highly sensitive people should never be made fun of or used for the monetary profit of their therapists.  But I do believe that many do such an unethical practice and charge the government excessive amounts for \\"using\\" these folks as guinea pigs.

B00005JNTX|5.0|Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" is a bleak, foreboding cartoonish group of interlocking vignettes depicting the criminal element of corrupt Basin City.  The flick is stylishly filmed in predominantly black and white with occasional splashes of color to enhance the characters festooned against impressive computer generated backgrounds.  The influence of Quentin Tarantino, a guest director of the movie, is seen here, as the plot format is reminiscent of \\"Pulp Fiction\\".<br /><br />Pulp drama veteran Bruce Willis plays angina suffering cop Martigan who on the verge of retirement is compelled to rescue a kidnapped young girl from the clutches of Nick Stahl a psychotic rapist and killer.  The trouble is that Stahl is the son of corrupt Senator Roark, Powers Boothe and therefore protected.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke, whose style fits like a glove in ultra violent movies, plays career criminal, the seemingly indestructible Marv.<br />He seeks to avenge the murder of a gorgeous hooker Goldie played by the attractive Jaime King.  Goldie was the only gal to ever pay the fierce looking Rourke, made up with facial and mandibular prostheses, any attention.  He goes on a killing spree that includes Elijah Wood, the cannibalistic murderer of his precious Goldie.<br /><br />Clive Owen and Benicio del Toro star in another of the seemingly relentlessly violent stories.  Owen plays Dwight, the avenging angel of the gorgeous prostitutes of Oldtown.  The automatic weapon toting prostitutes represented by Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, and Alexis Bledel among others are allowed to govern their turf in a deal forged with the cops.  This truce is threatened when dirty cop del Toro and his boys make trouble in Oldtown and wind up getting dispatched.  Owen helps the ladies quash the evidence that could topple the delicate balance that exists.<br /><br />Miller's slick transformation of his graphic novels to the screen using an impressive and formidible cast created a graphic yet highly entertaining movie experience.
0972169504|5.0|I was a doctoral student at Stanford at the same time as Jorge, and have been reading the strip since it first appeared in the student paper. From virtually the first day it ran, it has always demonstrated remarkable insight into the highs and lows of the experience. A small part of the humor is Stanford-specific, and so won't make much sense to people from other schools, but the vast majority is remarkably universal. The sad thing is that the handful of friends for whom I've bought the book -- as a way to give them a sense of what I was going through, since no amount of verbal explanation really seemed to convey it accurately -- all had pretty much the same reaction: \\"Geez, why would you put yourself through that? Why would anyone?!?\\" <br /> <br />Despite that, both books are brillant, and very much worth having.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Wonderful movie to awaken the mind of those who can still be awakened... Not many in the country where this happened... controlled by the media, power of the president and his quest for world domination. This happened when bush's popularity was at its lowest, especially after having stolen (bought) the election... here's how your president thank you, ladies and gentlemen. He needed something to be made a hero, there it was... This film, unfortunately, doesn't show the improbabilities of many things that happened before and especially after the event. I won't get into the \\"conspiracy theory\\", but those of you who have the brain and guts to look for the truth, it is out there... look and thou shall find... <br />I wonder what Mr. Moore's next movie will be: Bush Vs Katrina? or how can a \\"president\\" cut funds to protect the coast of the Gulf of Mexico (the area where New Orleans is... was?...) to be sent to their useless troops of killers in Iraq... remember what he told you he was going to do there? Look, find, and destroy Weapons of Mass Destruction??? You were lied, right on your face, again, people... and now that it IS another Vietnam.. what does he need to make you forget about Iraq? Another home tragedy... The guy is an opportunist, firing people instead of himself for incompetency, taking any opportunity to look like a hero and make you forget the real problems... 2 home tragedies to make you forget 2 bigger problems... Come on, people, take this guy out of office NOW before he does any more damage... That would be a good next movie for Mr. Moore: Bush vs Katrina... <br />

1591396190|3.0|After reading the book, I was thrilled to see the Columbus' egg again. Back to 500 years ago, Christopher Columbus attends a dinner which a Spanish gentleman for the honor of discovering \\"New Continent\\". One guy sniffed Columbus's discovery as trivial sailing. Then Columbus asked the gentlemen in attendance to make an egg stand on end. After the gentlemen successively tried to and failed, they stated that it was impossible. Finally, Columbus placed the egg's small end on the table, breaking the shell a bit, so that it could stand upright. Columbus then stated that it was \\"the simplest thing in the world. Anybody can do it, after he has been shown how!\\" <br /> <br />I guess no one would disagree that the business should go from the lower value position to the higher value post. But how many people know the exact number of rejections which Howard Shultz, Starbucks' founder and CEO, got for the financing of his business plan? Even I know some VCs who used to yell Howard out of their offices since the last thing a big city (like New York City or Seattle) needs is another caf. Why did those VCs not see the blue ocean of Starbucks then? <br /> <br />The authors improvise one method to do \\"value innovation\\": In a product/service life cycle, you analyze the value of each function. Then you can make better profit by moving some specific functions to higher value poitions. Is this noval and wonderful design? I recall the Smiling Curve from Acer's founder and former CEO Stan Shih. Back to early 1990s, Stan had found the problems of low value creation of  PC manufacturing. After analyzing the major functions, he wanted to create higher values through the two ends of the Smiling Curve, R&D and branding. However, Acer still could not beat all other big PC makers till today (though Acer is in the top 5 group). Yet IBM makes it through the successful migration from hardware manufacturing to IT service leader. (The new product lines of IT/Business should be regarded as strategic moves and new R&D/marketing activities. And I think it's OK for people to think it another successful case from read oceans to blue oceans.)  <br /> <br />In my opinions, neither the original noval design (Columbus' egg) or excellent execution (like IBM's turn over) is easy. If we look deeper, we'll find more problems to move to blue oceans by current organization designs and processes. For example, the current department based cost accounting and activities should transform to project/activity accounting and cross-function cooperation. That's why Samsung's VIP (Value Innovation Program) is so hard to imitate for most manufacturers in the world.  <br /> <br />Though it's genuinely hard to make blue ocean strategy work, I still have to give credit for the authors' wonderful analogy and great compilation of business innovations. At least you'll know the importance to escape from red oceans if you are right there. Being aware of the coming dangers is key for survival, and the future value creation if you navigate through it. <br />
B0009UC7H0|1.0|I thought it looked like a bunch of men running around in circles trying to look like they were acting and trying to make a movie. But then don't rely on me cuz I fell asleep during the first third of it.
B00011CZRE|5.0|Wow. That's how I have to start off this review of \\"Seven\\". This is absolutely one of the most disturbing, chilling and intelligent suspense thrillers I have ever seen. A killer uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his inspiration for murder, and Brad Pitt (as the newly assigned and eager David Mills) and Morgan Freeman (the cynical veteran inner-city cop William Somerset), are the two detectives assigned to the case.<br /><br />Morgan, as always, is amazing in his role, one that is right up there with his performances in \\"Glory\\" and \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\". There is only one scene in which he actually smiles and laughs, but that's about it. He engrosses himself in this role and plays it with deadpan seriousness. He also muses about how society is changing and not for the better, and this is a major influence for his decision to retire from the force. Brad Pitt, who is equally as good, provides some comic relief, spouting some of the funniest quips in the movie. But you never lose sight of the fact that this is a dark, hard-edged drama with horrible things happening to the victims of \\"John Doe\\" (Kevin Spacey), the brilliantly calculating but equally insane, creepy murderer who never leaves a fingerprint behind at a crime scene (and you will go \\"ugh\\" when you find out just why that is so). He, however, always leaves a small clue at each gruesome crime scene for Somerset and Mills to find to link one victim to the next. Doe feels it's his duty to \\"turn the sin against the sinner\\". There is a method to his madness, though: He chose his victims carefully, according to the way they lived their lives. He doesn't feel that they are \\"victims\\" but people who all deserved to die, and he believes that he was the one who was \\"chosen\\" to eliminate them.<br /><br />\\"Seven\\" is symbolic of several things in this film: Of course, as I mentioned earlier, the Seven Deadly Sins (Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, Wrath) are the killer's inspiration; Somerset has only seven days to retirement and he was given this assignment as his final investigation; seven is the also the amount of days that transpire between the beginning and the ending of this case; and seven are the amount of victims that are at John Doe's mercy in that time span.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Mills' wife Tracey, and there is a certain sadness to her character, something she reveals to Somerset one day while they are having breakfast in a diner. Even though her role is not one that is major throughout this movie, she is a crucial element that plays itself out in the climax of the film.<br /><br />One thing I've noticed that adds to the somberness of this film is that in every scene, practically every day, it is dark, dreary and raining. The last day, as a change of pace, the rain has stopped and the sun comes out. The movie's climax takes place in the desert, and what transpires between Somerset, Mills and John Doe will totally knock you out. I remember not being able to breathe during the last few minutes of \\"Seven\\" because I was literally on the edge of my seat. With great performances, a stellar script and exceptional direction, \\"Seven\\" is an excellent film that you will never forget.he was given this assignment as his final investigation; seven is the also the amount of days that transpire between the beginning and the ending of this case; and seven are the amount of victims that are at John Doe's mercy in that time span.

B0009I7NNA|1.0|Bands like Avenged Sevenfold, Atreyu, As i lay crying, and bleeding through really give metal music a bad name.  Its not metal, but 14 year old 'scene' kids seem to think it is, and by doing so disgracing true metal.  They all sound and look exactly the same: angled haircut, girl pants(crossdressing), eyeliner, singing about pain and crying. Its all so terrible.  If you listen to this kind of music, im sorry, but you really need start thinking for yourself and not be swayed by whatever Headbangers Ball is playing at the moment.  All these bands are simply stealing Scandinavian metal melodic lines from much more talented bands, adding breakdowns to make it 'hardcore' and calling it new and original.  Metal mixed with hardcore is not original anymore.  It was back when Corrosion of Conformity was doing it back in the 80s.  People that listen to this 'metalcore' bs were listening to limp bizkit and linkin park only a few years ago.  Its the same problem with a different look and sound.  Hopefully it too will fade out and everyone will realize how incredibly bad it was.
B00005JODA|5.0|Spies. Corporate corruption. Political intrigue. Secret drug testings. Murder, mass and private. It is strange, perhaps, that a film involving all of these elements should be entitled \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" and even stranger that a film so named would be one of the year's most exceptional. But so it is.<br /><br />The eponymous protagonist of \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" Justin Quayle (played with reserved intensity by Ralph Fiennes), is at first glance just that: a mild-mannered, middle-aged minor British diplomat who is, it seems, constantly gardening. His much younger wife Tessa (a luminously fearless Rachel Weisz), who is impassioned and tactless and everything Justin is not, says, not unkindly, that he \\"dreams of a world without any weeds.\\" That this observation is patently true makes Justin's inevitable journey from placid gardener to incensed investigator even more alluring to watch.<br /><br />But exactly how well Justin Quayle suits the title, and the title its story, is not unfolded all at once, for this is a film of gradual revelations, where the audience is rarely allowed to see more than Justin does. We first see him reluctantly but tenderly seeing his activist wife Tessa off at a remote African airport. The domesticity of the scene is belied by a sense of consternation that is quickly brought to fruition, as the scene fades to reveal a smoldering truck, turned on its side in muddy, blood-red sand under a scorching sun, with a black body-bag being hauled away from it.<br /><br />This disquieting scene is followed by a series of sharp narrative and mood shifts: first to Justin's quiet, softly-lit office, filled with his omnipresent plants, where he learns of Tessa's death, and then to a much earlier moment in the story, when he first met her. Just as suddenly, we are torn from a brightly-lit, celebratory love scene between them to a dark and gruesome Kenyan morgue, where he must identify her bloodied remains. The contrasts pull one into the story; like the protagonist, we are never quite sure what is coming next.<br /><br />The film continues to loop back on itself at intervals, telling itself to us through Justin's eyes and memories. Several times the audience is shown things we remember seeing before, but that take on a new meaning because of what we have learned since. Despite the frequently nonlinear pacing of the film, it never drags. Indeed, it plays like a first-rate thriller, with the stakes and complications ever increasing as Justin uncovers more of his wife's politically disastrous discoveries about big pharmaceutical companies and their drug tests in Africa. \\"Disposable drugs for disposable people,\\" a character remarks at one point. \\"We're not killing anyone who isn't going to be dead already.\\"<br /><br />There is more than eloquent rhetoric at work through all of this, though; there are violent threats, assassination attempts, and even a car chase through the Sudanese desert. And yet, there are poignant moments too; this is as much the story of a man on a quest to discover the truth about a woman he loved but never understood as it is a race to publish the truth about corporate corruption and greed.<br /><br />The filmmaking itself is extraordinary; I have seen nothing else like it this<br />year. Director Fernando Meirelles and his cinematographer C&eacute;sar Charlone also made \\"City of God,\\" another complicated, breathtakingly beautiful story with a deeply personal feel and a sense of urgency that are also present in \\"The Constant Gardener.\\" In the scenes between Tessa and Justin, their world is brightly lit, alive and vibrant with color and sound. When he has her no longer, the world becomes unfriendly: grey and gloomy or viciously scorching. Meirelles uses handheld cameras to draw one into the action; it feels intimate, personal, with an almost documentary-like quality to it. One feels immediately as though one is being presented with truth.<br /><br />Whether or not the plot of \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is true or not is really<br />irrelevant, though John le Carr&eacute; certainly brings conviction to it; rarely<br />has even he been this obviously indignant over something, and this infuriation is passed on to the audience. And it is not a plot that panders to popular conventions. \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is a romance, but it is not a romantic story: some \\"very nasty things live in gardens,\\" particularly this one. The Kenya where Justin and Tessa work is one of sewage-ridden shantytowns and sickness, hope and quiet desperation intermingled. And the ending of the film, though it is true to life and wrenches a gut emotional response from the viewer, is not contrived for a false happy ending. This film knows what many do not, and is not afraid to say so: that the truth is not only something worth dying for, but something that frequently requires it.ertainly brings conviction to it; rarely  has even he been this obviously indignant over something, and this infuriation is passed on to the audience.

B000268QB2|4.0|I think that this is a great new band.  Their sound on this album is fresh and relaxing.  It's a good album to just \\"chill\\" to.  I think Keane will go far, and I hope that they come out with more albums as good as this one.
B000000W5H|4.0|This album has been hailed by many as among the band's worst effort. Some blame it on Keith's drug habits, some blame it on the muddy sounding production (which really isnt even that bad). I, however, can get past all of that and focus in on the songs. How do they rank? Pretty good, in my book. Not their strongest material, but not weak. <br /> <br />1. If You Can't Rock Me - Solid uptempo Stones rocker. Crunchy guitars, thumping bass, pounding drums and Mick yelling out the vocals in what I think is one of his best vocal performances on a hard rocker. 9/10 <br /> <br />2. Aint Too Proud To Beg - Cover of the old Motown classic. The Stones make it their own. Again, some nice guitar work on this track. I think the chorus goes on a bit too long at the end, but that's just nitpicking. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />3. It's Only Rock And Roll - Classic song that I'm sure everyone has heard. Rocker with distorted Chuck Berry-ish guitar licks and an anthemic chorus. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. 'Till The Next Goodbye - Some dig this one, some don't. I don't really dig it that much. Acoustic pop ballad that just comes off as cheesy sounding to me. One I usually skip. 6/10 <br /> <br />5. Time Waits For No One - Hailed by many as Mick Taylor's greatest guitar achievement. I agree that he has some nice fretwork on here, but I think the actual song is better than the solo at the end. It just seems a bit too long. The actual song is midtempo with a dreamy sound throughout. The chorus is excellent in this one. 8/10 <br /> <br />6. Luxury - Just a fun song. Stones doing reggae. This is another one that goes on a bit too long (that's one of the flaws of the album, some of the songs just go on too long) but it's easy to get passed that after you've heard the song a few times. This isn't your typical reggae though, you know...it's got some crunchy guitars in it. 7/10 <br /> <br />7. Dance Little Sister - Uptempo rocker with crunchy guitars and a nice solo by Mick Taylor. Good song, but sometimes itsounds like the Stones are trying too hard to sound like the Stones, if you know what I mean. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />8. If You Really Want To Be My Friend - This album came out in 1974...and when you listen to this song, that's apparent. It doesn't have a trendy type sound to it or anything, but it does have that mid 70's pop kind of sound. Another one that needs about a minute and a half trimmed off of it. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />9. Short and Curlies - This is another one of those fun tracks. I love it. Nice uptempo bluesy jam with both Mick and Keith audible on vocals together. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />10. Fingerprint File - This one took some time to grow on me, but now it's one of my favorites. If your familiar with 1997's \\"Out Of Control\\", I'd compare it to that. Funk with some nice wah wah guitar. Nice album closer. 9/10 <br /> <br />Opens on a strong note, closes on a strong note. There are a few duds (namely 'Till the Next Goodbye' & 'If You Really Want To Be My Friend') but nothing unlistenable on here. This isn't one of the bands classics and the key to enjoying this album is just to listen to it with an open mind. It really does have a fun vibe to it.
B000000WZ4|5.0|All of the songs are great!  The whole album has the typical Depeche Mode style, some dark, some instrumental, etc.  I love Depeche Mode and am sorry that I didn't buy this album until now.
0812550706|5.0|My Uncle gave me this as a christmas present many years back... I must have been about 12 or so. It was my first real novel, and still, nearly eight years later, remains my favorite. <br /> <br />The characters in this book are fantastic. One thing that I always appreciate is a hero who isn't all sunshine. Ender is troubled, lonely, and always looking over his shoulder - but he's not week. When he looks over and does find someone there ready to hurt him, he can crack you open.  <br /> <br />As this is a book with child and young-teenage characters with elevated IQs, it would have been easy to step over the line and create unbelievable situations. Sort of like your average sitcom or kids movie... really smart kids outsmart the bad boss adult. Not here. <br /> <br />I have to go - at a library - but believe me... the characters are so deep, this book changed my entire thought process as a human being.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I liked the movie which was based on the comic book Hellblazer.  The DVD Special features I enjoyed very much.  It gave a more in depth look at the translation from comic to film.  I was really impressed as to how the special effects artists were able to create the hell demons.  The comic book is very good added bonus.
B0009X766Y|3.0|First, my rating of three stars is strictly for the execution of this new DVD edition of The Sting, and not of the movie itself, which I consider a masterpiece in terms of both entertainment and craftsmanship. The Sting is easily one of my top 10 films of all time. Other reviews here cover the movie itself. <br /> <br />REVIEW OF THE LEGACY SERIES DVD EDITION <br /> <br />For the purpose of comparison, I'll first discuss Universal's original mediocre DVD release of The Sting in 1.33:1, which is basically full screen. I, like many others, have grown accustomed to anamorphic 1.85:1 widescreen and thus was initially disappointed and assumed it was pan-and-scam. However, with some research later I discovered that the director's original intent was to frame it as an old movie at 4:3, which is how it was shown when originally released in 1973. 1.33:1 is actually pretty close, so I was satisfied with the aspect ratio after all.  <br /> <br />Regrettably, the digital transfer of original old DVD release is watchable but uninspiring; it's washed out, grainy, and there are noticeable artifacts throughout. Also, less important to me but still notable, it effectively offers no extras and the sound quality is merely adequate.   <br /> <br />The new Legacy Series DVD just released (Sept 6, 2005) attempts to offer a more respectable package for an Oscar-winning classic. The case is attractive and of relative good quality, Universal made the effort to interview key surviving cast members (George Roy Hill and Robert Shaw are sadly no longer with us) for a worthy 60 minute retrospective documentary, and, most important, delivered a cleaner, brighter, and sharper print with good sound. (There is a quick frame jump right after the opening credits, however. A minor nitpick, but it's noticeable.) <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Universal really blew it in one regard. They decided to deliver the new version as widescreen, despite it not being originally filmed that way. To do this, they simply added black bars to the top and bottom of the screen to achieve 1.85:1. In other words, they faked it. I suppose because the general DVD viewing audience has grown accustomed to expect widescreen now, the bean counters at Universal must have decided to meet these expectations, and with the director dead, there was no dissent.  <br /> <br />This is very unfortunate, because -- and I did a side-by-side comparison between both DVD versions -- the simulated anamorphic treatment cuts off the top and bottom of the film to a fair degree. I'd estimate perhaps 10-15% of the film is lost. Heads and hats are cut, and many other details are obscured. Although this might seem trivial to many, it does alter the original presentation and overall feel of the movie.  <br /> <br />Although the original DVD is not 4:3, 1.33:1 is much closer to 4:3 than 1.85:1 is, and it's a big difference.  <br />If Universal had just left it at 1.33:1 with the new print and extras, this would have been an excellent version. Perhaps someday they'll get it right.  <br /> <br />So, what to do? If you want the original presentation as intended by the director and don't mind a marginal print, go with the old DVD. If a cleaner print is more important and you want the documentary, get the new version. As a huge fan of this film, I guess I'll keep both for now.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|Despite all the controversy that has occured with Michael Jackson, he is truly the king of pop and he truly has one of the best recording voices ever.  You can't deny that Michael Jackson is one of the most influential artists not only in pop, but also in the Twentieth Century of music itself.  THRILLER has sold millions and millions of records and continues to sell and stand the test of time.<br /><br />This collaboration is one of the most complete MJ collaborations that I have seen.  This one not only contains Jackson's solo career but also contains his work with the Jackson 5.  Unfortunately, maybe this should've been a 3 disc set, because there are a few of his most notable hits missing including \\"I'll Be There\\", a standard song in Jackson's arsenal.  Otherwise, it is probably the most complete compilation that you will find for MJ.<br /><br />It is wonderful reliving hits such as \\"I Want You Back\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\", \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\", and etc... 4 stars.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I just bought the dvd, and though I didn't like that there were not any special features, I still loved the movie. Watched it with my son and his friend, who were both prepared to hate this  <br />\\"80's\\" film....they both enjoyed it(they've watched it twice since). So it's not some \\"masterpiece\\" that will 'cause hours of discussion...so? It's about teens, the pressures placed on teens, the feelings that consume them. I may be a little older, but I still remember how it felt to be a teenager!
B000654Z2I|5.0|quite simply, CAN's \\"Tago Mago\\" is a landmark album. it's certainly not commercially accessable, therefore rendering it not for everyone, but those who listen with an open mind and think back that this music was recorded in 1971 will be absolutely blown away. there has never been a band like CAN and their influence can be felt far and wide in modern musical circles. the vocals are here and there, sometimes fading in and out  of range, floating like ghostly verses. the music rambles along and grounds the songs deep in their groove. hard to believe, but this is improvisation. these songs were painstakingly pieced together with numerous tape edits from jam sessions with the band. which is amazing not just in itself, but with this in mind, it adds a whole new dimension to how the editing is just as much an instrument as the guitar or drums. this is high quality classic rock music with a highly spaced out edge. some would call it psychadelic and i think the term applies, but this is beyond what you can expect.
B000002572|5.0|Filled with Rock Classics like Smokin', Hitch a Ride, and Let Me Take You Home Tonight. This is a perfect album. When I play it, I am transported back to my childhood. It Rocks! <br />
B0000029DD|4.0|I heard a couple of tracks from this record on KCRW before I bought it.  Either this guy is pouring his heart and soul into his music or he is really good at faking it!  Not really my kind of music but it is good enough to appeal to anybody I think.  It improves after multiple listenings...
0671042858|5.0|How many different types of projects can Stephen King tackle with such effortless mastery?<br /><br />The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon proves a lot of things. Once again, it proves that King's prose is in a class that is more in line with modern literary greats like Irving than his pulp genre contemporaries. It proves that King can stamp his special brand of horror onto a wide range of genres, in this case the classic tale of outdoor survival. It also proves that, long past what many critics call his golden years, King can find new types of protagonists and backgrounds to handle expertly.<br /><br />In this case, the protagonist is Trisha, a young girl. The background is a forbidding New England wilderness that hosts a palpable aura of menace.<br /><br />The most chilling parts of this book don't revolve around the supernatural. Rather, they are the parts when Trisha starts to break down because her body has been pushed to the brink, and beyond.<br /><br />If you are a big fan of King, you're probably going to pick this up regardless. If you're nto a big fan of King, this is an excellent book to cut your teeth on, particularly if you enjoy wilderness survival-type stories. It is steeped in King's style of writing, but also rises above his more generic horror works.
B000002KE2|3.0|Bluntly speaking, Black Sabbath has always been one of my favorite metal bands: \\"Paranoid,\\" \\"Master of Reality\\" \\"Sabotage\\" are all classics. This album, unfortunately, is a half-arsed effort from guys with A.) Entirely too much booze and cocaine; B.) Entirely too great an opinion of themselves (The same thing killed Jim Morrison, spoiled Led Zeppelin and broke up the Beatles; C.) Scraping mud from the Well of Inspiration and calling it Perrier. After this album was \\"Never Say Die\\" which has exactly ONE passible song (\\"Johnny Blade,\\" which needs to be re-done [Have faith; my band is working on it.] and the Ne Plus Suckarootie Puke-fest \\"Technical Ecstacy,\\" one of those albums with a great name that absolutely BLOWS! <br />Honestly, if you want a GREAT Sabbath album, I recommend \\"Black Sabbath\\" (first album) through \\"Sabotage.\\" All of those are truly great. <br />Blessed Bees (Whudda BUZZ!!!) <br />
B00025ETIW|5.0|Really... anyone who gave this album a bad review seems to have only seen and heard I'm Not Okay (I Promise) and Helena.  While I personally like those two songs, they are far from the best tracks on the album.  The entire album does not, in fact, have anything to do with the lyricist's girlfriend breaking up with him, but actually tells a story of a comic bookish undead anti-hero who makes a deal with the devil to collect the corpses of 1,000 evil men in order to see his thought-to-be-deceased lover. <br /> <br />As for the \\"image\\"... personally, I do not dress like Gerard and the boys, but I also don't see anything wrong with the way they dress and portray themselves... I don't see it as unoriginal or following a fad.  Just because you do something that someone else is doing, it does not make it necessarily copying and following a fad.  Anyway... this review of others' pointless reviews serves no purpose.  If you enjoy good lyric storytelling and reckless ultraviolence, buy this CD and its predecessor (which is definitely just as good, and begins the story continued on this album).
B00005JNJT|4.0|After watching the movie, I finally went out and got issues #404-#407, the issues in which this movie is supposedly based. After reading the comic, there is nothing in the movie that was drawn from this 'Year One' storyline, other than the premise that it shows Batman in the starting years. These issues do not account for Bruce Wayne's 7 year absence, do not refer to any training, does not mention Rha Al Ghul, and spends half the time centered on a young lieutenant Gordon who has just arrived in Gotham. <br /> <br />To review this movie, I wanted to know how true it was to the comic book. And having read the Year One storyline, I still do not know. Having said that, this is probably the best Batman movie made. It establishes a more serious, darker insight into the character. More true to the modern era of Batman, not the kiddie stuff we grew up with in the 70s. It was interesting to see Batman's training, and the rationale as to why a man would want to become a bat. <br /> <br />Cristian Bale is great, and I'm glad to hear he has signed up to do more movies. Katie Holmes had a smaller role than I expected, and this is the first time I've seen Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow), who plays a great villian. If you've seen any of the previous Batman movies and like it, then you have to go see this one!
0099450259|5.0|Writing this first novel from the point of view of an autistic 15-year-old, Mark Haddon takes the reader into the chaos of autism and creates a character of such empathy that many readers will begin to feel for the first time what it is like to live a life in which there are no filters to eliminate or order the millions of pieces of information that come to us through our senses every instant of the day. For the autistic person, most stimuli register with equal impact, and Christopher's teacher Siobhan, at the special school he attends, has been trying to teach him to deal with the confusing outside world more effectively. At fifteen he is on the verge of gaining some tenuous control over the mass of stimuli which often sidetrack him.<br /><br />When the dog across the street is stabbed and dies, Christopher decides to solve the mystery and write a book about it. His favorite novel, The Hound of the Baskervilles, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, becomes his model as he investigates the crime, uncovering many secrets involving his own family in the process. Innocent and honest, he sees things logically and interprets the spoken word literally, unable to recognize the clues which would tell him if someone is being dishonest, devious, or even facetious. As he tells his story in a simple subject-verb-object sentence pattern, Christopher tries to communicate and give order to his world, and the reader can easily see how desperate he is to find some pattern which will enable him to make sense of it.<br /><br />Christopher's investigations eventually require him to make some remarkably brave decisions, and when he faces his fears and moves beyond his immediate neighborhood, the magnitude of this challenge is both dramatic and poignant. Strange places have always been traumatic for him, and he has difficulties with his emotions. \\"Feelings,\\" he says, \\"are just having a picture on the screen in your head.\\" He responds either with logic or with the anger which sometimes overwhelms him as result of fear or frustration, and the reader cannot help aching for him and empathizing with his family.<br /><br />Christopher's coming-of-age story is most unusual, if not unique, and he ends the book a much more mature 15-year-old than he was when he started. With warmth and humor, Haddon creates a fascinating main character, allowing the reader to share in his world and experience his ups and downs, his trials and successes. In providing a vivid world in which the reader participates vicariously, Haddon fulfills the most important requirements of fiction, entertaining at the same time that he broadens the reader's perspective and allows him to gain knowledge.

0743454537|5.0|This is a great book and you won't believe the ending what a twist.  I couldn;t put it down.  Such a great story and all the charaters narrate about themselves and how they see things.  I read this book in two days and everyone I have lended it to loved it also.  I highly recommend it.
B000002B7M|5.0|If you are a metal fan this album should be in your collection. THis album next to the first 3 Van Halen albums would set the direction for the 80's metal scene. This album also has another distinction to it, this is Randy Rhoads debut with a major signed band. Keep in mind I am talking about Blizzard of Ozz and not Ozzy, those are two differnet bands, critics say it all the time in reviews on these albums. I would define Blizzard as any Ozzy material that came out when Randy was still alive. With that said here is the track review (this is for the original, unlike some unfortunate people I kept the old one and the only reason why I didn't get the remaster was because one of my friends bought it and they got ripped off!):<br /><br />1.I Don't Know: Amazing gong intro, gives the track a meaning of depth and personality. THere also is kind of a 70's hard rock feel to it, the mellow guitar harmony by Rhoads sounds a little bit like Boston! An overall great opening track, Ozzy uses this track as an opener on almost all of his concerts and just listening to it you can tell it is the quintessential opening track in metal history. 10/10<br /><br />2.Crazy Train: I think Crazy Train is a great song but I don't think it's Ozzy's greatest. It's a catchy tune and I think there was some creative lyric writing involved but the synthesizer effects I couldn't get used to. For example: \\"IIIEEEE!\\" or the laughing at the end with the word \\"EGG\\". But otherwise I think its a great song. Ozzy had better songs though, its kind of strange that this is one of the few he is recognized for. 9.34/10<br /><br />3.Goodbye to Romance: A very good metal ballad, I like Ozzy's humanity and personality on this song. Randy also comes in with a perty good solo I think that makes this perhaps Ozzy's greatest ballad. And being a not-so-big Sabbath fan, I think the meaning behind this: Ozzy's departure from Sabbath, as great lyrical idea writing. 10/10<br /><br />4.Dee: A 50 second or so acoustic piece by the Rhoadsmaster himself. It makes a pretty good instrumental introduction for the next track Suicide Solution. 10/10<br /><br />5.Suicide Solution: Heavy riffery throughout, and very creative lyrics. I think this song possibly has Ozzy's most creative lyrics, describing in detail Bon Scott's tragic death. Plus the \\"Satan! Satan!\\" chant in the background makes for hillarious effect in the middle of the track. I was kind of disappointed by the lack of solos by Randy on this track by otherwise its good. If you have to listen to a version of this song, I would recommend the live Randy version instead as it is much longer and has the most wickedly awesome 2.5 minute guitar solo in it. 9.5/10<br /><br />6.Mr. Crowley: In my opinion the quintessential dark Ozzy song. Before Bloodbath in Paradise, before Secret Loser, before Waiting for Darkness, and before Diary of a Madman, there was this piece. It sets the standard for all other dark metal riffery. Randy's solo on this is perhaps one of the most memorable in all of heavy metal. 10/10<br /><br />7.No Bone Movies: A creative idea, Ozzy writing about his Blue addiction. It is a surprisingly heavy song clocking in at I'd say about 4 minutes, there is great drumming on this courtesy of Lee Kerslake, who is perhaps one of the most legendary drummers in metal history if not of all rock n' roll! Randy has an interesting guitar piece here too, although it seems a little too high pitched at times. THis was probably meant as a filler, but as you can see, any track on this album is so good that the fillers are what normal great songs would be. 9/10<br /><br />8.Revelation (Mother Earth): An absolutely awesome song! It starts out with the classic guitar and Ozzy's melodic singing about man's war like fever and the fear of nuclear war that would ruin the planet. About 3.5 minutes into the song Ozzy stops singing and all we hear is Randy's magnificent guitar composition. When there is like a minute left, Randy guns out this guitar solo that is so sudden one second the temp is a little heavy all the way to brain melting virtuoso energy that easily makes this song the greatest on this album if not Ozzy's best song ever. Could this be the beginning of thrash? 100/10<br /><br />9.Steal Away (the Night): A real statement of love and rebellion, Steal Away opens with these great guitar licks and drum beats. A real short song, I think this might actually be Ozzy's shortest ORIGINAL song at 3:29. I just like the overall atmosphere of the track and how lyrically great the Ozz describes rebellious state of love. 9.65/10<br /><br />By now I think all of the Led addicts have gotten my memo, so I have erased the message and instead have decided to describe my ratings system I invented. When I first started reviewing I came up with this rating system on my No Rest For the Wicked review. Basically I would rate an album in comparison to other albums by the same artist.<br />Overall, I would rate this next to Diary of a Madman as Ozzy's best studio recording:<br />Ozzy's greatest albums from best to worst:<br />1.Randy Rhoads Tribute<br />2.Diary of a Madman<br />3.Blizzard of Ozz<br />4.No Rest for the Wicked<br />5.No More Tears<br />6.The Ultimate Sin<br />7.Live and Loud<br />8.Just Say Ozzy<br />9.Speak of the Devil<br />10.Bark at the Moon<br />11.Ozzmosis<br />Anything after Ozzmosis isn't really worth adding on here.olo that is so sudden one second the temp is a little heavy all the way to brain melting virtuoso energy that easily makes this song the greatest on this album if not Ozzy's best song ever.

B0000CFW87|5.0|I always marvel over what a wonderful voice this young person has.  I'm never disappointed.
B0000042MY|5.0|This is one of the very best film scores, despite the odd bybrid of Trevor Jones's classic full-orchestra score and Randy Edelman's pared-down synthesizer cues. The unique flavor of this Michael Mann masterpiece comes through in every nuance of the score. The main title theme is unforgettable, one of the most majestic bits of composition in the classic movie-spectacular style; and the Celtic sound of \\"The Gael,\\" heard in \\"The Kiss\\" and in \\"Promontory,\\" is especially infectious. My one beef is the illogical way in which the CD is arranged (just as the cassette was before it). If you know the film well, try this experiment: Back up the CD, then rearrange the cuts in the order in which they actually appear in the movie. It's a very different, and even more thrilling, listening experience. In any order, though, every bit of music on this album is a treasure.
B0007VZ9DK|2.0|This is a great movie, a second purchase for me as I have the original DVD that came out a while back.  I bought the tenth anniversary edition, expecting even greater picture quality along with numerous additional features.  Universal didn't disappoint in that area; however, my disc freezes (and skips) so frequently, that I'm unable to watch the movie.  I've contacted Universal and have been told to return the defective disc to them, along with a detailed explanation of my problem.  I imagine that the company will send me a replacement, since they did replace two defective discs from my Abbott and Costello collection (took about six weeks to get them).  As much as I like their movies, I really find it frustrating as a consumer to have to deal with this problem.  Seems to me that Universal could take steps to alleviate this situation.
6303477259|3.0|I recently bought the \\"currently available\\" DVD off Ebay.  The audio is pretty decent, but the video quality is typical blurry VHS.  Nothing is worse than seeing VHS quality when you stick a DVD in your player.  Someone needs to step up and get this great show released in true DVD quality.<br /><br />As for the show itself, WOW.  What potential there is here to release a truly great DVD.  It needs some work though.  There is wayyyy too much emphasis on the light show and not enough on the musicians.  In fact, it is often so dark much of the time you can't really see them, just silhouettes.  Granted the light show is spectacular and quite possibly the best EVER staged, but this is Pink Floyd man.  Show the band!  There are far too many shots that look like they are from 1/2 mile away.<br /><br />Setlist and performance are great, it just isn't presented in a way that can be appreciated.  Almost forgot, the video and audio are out of sync several times on this disc too.  I suppose we can all hope for a re-release.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I simply love this album. I listened to it for the first time back in July 2004 and since then it has never annoyed me. <br />In my opinion , the songs are really introspective and the lyrics are symbolic. This means that the songs don't say what/who they are about, and everyone can find a different meaning to them. The lyrics are very important in this album. I'd say it's made 50% of music and 50% of words. If you listen to this album without paying attention to (or reading) the lyrics you're getting only half of it. The thing I admire most, musically, is that the structure of the songs is pretty simple, but they refine every song the best way they can and the result is wonderful. Every note highlights the taste Opeth have for music.  <br />Great.

B0000549B0|5.0|Harvey is, to sum it up, a delightful movie. Jimmy Stewart does a wonderful job portraying Elwood P. Dowd, a loveable character with a pooka named Harvey as his best friend. The movie never fails to be entertaining no matter how many times you've seen it. If you want an escape from all of the junk on TV now which is filled with foul language, watch Harvey... it's one of the most decent things I've ever seen. Elwood is \\"oh, so pleasant\\" and that makes the entire movie light and very enjoyable. <br /> <br />If are looking for a fun movie to enjoy, this is for you!  (If you want to see another good, decent movie, I really recommend 'You Can't Take it With You', which has Stewart also).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never heard of Firefly until it began airing on the Sci-Fi channel in July.  I thought it was a new series.  But now...now I own the DVDs, have had Blue Sun custom tee shirts made, and am eagerly awaiting the release of the movie.  I'm a professional, really, and I usually don't respond this way to television, it being television and all.  Ahh, but Firefly is different, my friends. <br /> <br />Why?  Because this is the best science fiction series I have ever seen.  It's full of sympathetic characters who act like real people in tough situations.  It's got pathos, it's got ethos, it's got gorgeous women who carry big guns and kind of scare me.  I cannot fathom why Fox cancelled it, but it has made a big damn fan girl outta me, that's for sure. <br /> <br />Let me hear you sing it, Browncoats!  \\"Take my love, take my land...\\"

0385334206|5.0|This is the \\"Mad Magazine\\" Vonnegut, and if you have little use for that particular publication then you should read Player Piano or Slaughterhouse 5 instead of this book.  The plot is quite simple on the face of it, a man going mad and the people he interacts with at a particular moment in time.  The subplot is the authors musings on \\"life, the universe, and everything and how he is making a \\"balls\\" out of writing the novel your reading.<br /><br />It's a damned clever idea, and it works quite well, even if the author didn't seem to think so at the time.  Much has been said about the \\"babytalk\\" and crude drawings that fill the book, one gets a sence that the author is going through a chardic experience while writing the book, ( as Vonnegut admits himself to one of the major charaters in the book at the end, ), this chardic experience we share with the author as we seemingly experience along with him a \\"suprise\\" ending that was forshadowed virtually from the opening page...we see the end playing out as outlined but as events often do, they sprial out of the authors hand and drag the story to unplanned and unexpected events.  Vonnegut himself seems to loose control of the situation towards the end, but he quickly re asserts himself for the final few pages in a funny yet profound way.<br /><br />The book is a product of it's times, I call it a product of my times because I grew up in the period.  In many ways the world has changed dramatically since then, so some observations tend to \\"jar\\" younger readers, like Mark Twain at his creative best, he is a mirror of his times, and as such some fine social satire is lost to modern audiences.<br /><br />Mr. Vonnegut uses some mild \\"bad language\\" in the book, as much to make fun of the subject as to mildly shock the reader. this is in the same sort of vein as a George Carlin comedy routine and not because the author actually believes such terms should be used to offend someone..indeed, he uses these \\"offensive terms\\" in such a way to remove their \\"special power\\" they have over our language...they color the dialog in a disarming way, which only the most skilled of writers can acomplish.<br /><br />Breakfast of Champions is more than a 50'th birthday present for the author, it is a gift from him to us as a reader.  This book is so many things skillfully blended together in satire and witt that I doub't even the author can list them all, which is a good thing really, since it keeps us comming back for the ocasional read years after we first experienced his work the first time.<br /><br />This is on my shortlist of great \\"novels\\", this is a book I would never let leave my library unless it takes a place next to my chair or bedside...if you find Monty Python funny, George Carlin a great social commentator, and Mark Twain a master of the written word you should like this book, but read it at face value first before you search for hidden meanings and rye observations, and it will soon be something you will savor again again in repeated readings.such a way to remove their \\"special power\\" they have over our language...they color the dialog in a disarming way, which only the most skilled of writers can acomplish. <br /> <br />Breakfast of Champions is more than a 50'th birthday present for the author, it is a gift from him to us as a reader.

0062502182|2.0|The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho, is billed as a modern classic, yet I find it difficult to discern why. It has the feel of a fable; from a time as hazy as the desert in which it is set, and carries the lessons on life one would expect from such a parable. The feelings of distant memory that it creates, however, fashion a gap between the book and the reader.<br /><br />It begins with Santiago, a shepherd boy, who gives up his customs to follow a dream he has, a vision of treasure found at the Egyptian pyramids. Along the way he meets a king, a crystal merchant, an Englishman, and an alchemist; all of whom, with their passing involvement, provide him with a piece of the spiritual jigsaw that is his life. Finally, when he arrives at the Egyptian pyramids, he learns a lesson in life that brings him happiness.<br /><br />The novel is short, and, while it gets its message across, a number of other things suffer. The characterisation is lean; everyone is faceless, ageless, and speaks with the same voice, a voice of implied wisdom. Most characters are also nameless; even Santiago, the protagonist, is simply referred to as `the boy' throughout. Setting, also, is a casualty of the book; while we follow Santiago through the desert, we never truly get the feeling of being there. We don't feel the heat, thirst for water, or shiver when night falls.<br /><br />The prose in the book is extremely simple, giving The Alchemist the feel of a children's book. Adjectives, especially when necessary, are rare, so that most things are described as `the desert', `a horse', or `some wine'. The desert has no texture, the horse no character, and the wine no flavour. Repetition, also, lengthens the book so that, once wisdom has been spoken, it echoes through the narrative so that each action can be credited.<br /><br />The Alchemist is a quick read, but it's not a good read. It has the feeling of a bonding session in the workplace where you discuss the implications of pseudo-situations, only moved from the office to the desert. It's a self-help book disguised as a novel, the \\"secrets\\" of life, though hardly life-changing, are listed as stages in one boy's discovery. I hope you discover this review before the novel.only moved from the office to the desert.

B0007M22TI|5.0|Celtic Woman is one of the few cds that I continue to play every so often long after I first received it.  I was already a big fan of the Corrs, Enya, Riverdance, and other new Irish groups, some of whom I first heard on the \\"Thistle and Shamrock\\" PBS show.  But Celtic Woman takes the genre to a new level, powered by the voices of Lisa, Chloe, Orla and Maiv and the inspired fiddling by Maihread, especially the haunting \\"Lagan Love\\" .  The DVD combines both ensemble and solo performances, so you get the best of both worlds and the effect of the arrangements of the director, David Downes' sheer musicality is stunning.  Chloe and Lisa seem to be having the most fun, while Maiv is like a big sister and Orla adds a classical Celtic moody delicacy. The blending of all four singers is especially wonderful on \\"Jesu\\", \\"Soft Goodbye\\", \\"One World\\" and \\"You Raise Me Up\\", while my favorite solos were \\"Danny Boy\\", \\"She Mov'd Thru' the Fair\\", \\"Someday\\" and especially Lisa's endearing \\"May it Be\\" and \\"Send Me A Song\\", accompanied by Downes on piano. I found the Lisa Kelly solo CD from the Celtic Woman website even more magnificent! (Unfortunately it's not available from Amazon yet!) Surprisingly my favorites of that CD - \\"Carrickfergus\\", \\"Home and the Heartland\\", \\"Homecoming\\" and \\"Now We Are Free\\" - are not on Celtic Woman. I also liked Chloe's solo CD which included more classical pieces.
B0000026WD|4.0|Dangerous~ Michael Jackson is not nearly as good as thriller, bad or off the wall. The sound even when it was released sounded a bit dated and it sounds like he uses the same spiel as he did on the Bad album and it does not work as well. There are some good tracks such \\"Black or white\\", \\"Remember the time\\" (yeah, that was the song for the video with Eddie Murphy playing the role of the King and I think Naomi Campel, but I am not sure, it has been quite many years since I saw it) and the overly sentimental but effective track \\"Heal the World\\". However, MJ has set the bar high for himself with previous releases such as Thriller and Bad and this is not on the same level and he could have used a new producer to made give him new ideas. The book-let is atrocious and the cover-art does not make any sense at all and seems to be a hopscotch of things put together at random with no real sense of direction behind it. On the whole this a good album and 4 stars is not a bad mark for an album that just does not have the brilliance of the past.
076790382X|5.0|I loved this book and told all of my friends about it.  In addition to being funny, it was well-researched, interesting, and informative.  The author is humble and gracious and is able to laugh at himself, a quality I find admirable and refreshing.  He is honest in his opinions without being self-righteous; and even in his criticism of the country, he expresses a hopefulness that it is possible to correct social injustice if we work together as a nation.<br /><br />However, none of that is the main point of the book.  It is simply a collection of his columns written for a British audience in which he makes observations about Americana that are hilarious most of the time.  I found myself laughing out loud in a waiting room full of people and then explaining to others what I was reading.  If you're looking for a book that will make you smile on an otherwise dreary day, this is the book for you.<br /><br />Divided into short chapters, it's a book that's easy to read in short bursts--a great book for someone who has difficulty commiting to a lengthy novel.
B00004XPPE|4.0|I have always been fascinated with the Cold War, especially the nuclear side of things. The fact that the US and the USSR engaged in 'Nuclear Upmanship' during the 1960s would mean increasing the nuclear stockpile on both sides. Of course, accidents can (and have) happened.<br /><br />With a great deal of thought, planning, systems implementation, checking and control, a system was implemented ensuring that even in a 'DefCon 1' situation (that's where Nuclear War has been declared), the deployment of nuclear weapons, so it was thought, could be 'controlled' and accidents could be avoided.<br /><br />So, what happens if that 'fail-safe' does actually fail? What implications are there when one of your own bombs Moscow? What options do you have? Do you continue? Do you stop? If you continue, the end result is fairly obvious; if you stop, what would you do to pay for your 'accident'?<br /><br />This is the kind of situation this film explores, and it does a darn good job at it. It is impactful, but just a little on the talkie side. Don't expect scenes of billowing mushrooms and people being vaporised (ala Threads or Day After), but do expect excellent performances from all involved!
B0001HLVS2|4.0|It would be impossible to capture the masterpiece of Patrick O'Brian's series -- this film must be judged on its own merits, rather than as a representation of any particular subset of the 20 1/2 volume series.  I strongly recommend anyone interested in this movie give the series a try -- start with the first, read the second, and see if you're hooked. <br /> <br />The film is a solid adventure.  The strongest point is to provide an audiovisual insight into the brutal, merciless life at sea during the period.  That the characters, while compelling, are somewhat shallow is a necessary compromise imposed by the constraints of a 2-hour film in which much of the time is taken with action -- if you want an in-depth study of character, read the books. <br /> <br />One factor in the film is things move a bit quickly.  Character interactions get a bit lost in the action; with the action established, a second viewing allows more attention to be granted to the people.  Even given the simplified nature of the screenplay, it could easily have been given an extra hour. <br /> <br />I recommend this film.  It's engaging, interesting, even a bit inspiring.  You can't really ask for more.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Excellent show cancelled by morons.  Killed way before it's time.  An amazing mix of the Sci Fi and Western genres with a good amount of dark humor mixed in.  Only 14 episodes but well worth it.  Go see the movie on 9/30/05 and hope that someone at Fox has some sense in them and brings this show back.
B000066744|4.0|Like the other reviewers, I have to say, this movie was a keeper.  Why?  Simply put, \\"...because of the music.\\"  Even a none music lover, will enjoy this movie.  Forget the story line. The music tells the story.  Don't ask me how this happened,  but somehow I first watched this movie without the dialogue.  I could hear glasses tinkle and footsteps, and all the background stuff, but no voices...and oh my goodness...the music! Most enchanting and enthralling of all is the scene where they have decided after all these years, to finally record the main character playing his music.  As fate would have it, it happens on a day when a naturally pretty immigrant girl just happens to catch the eye of the pianist through a porthole, and what emerges from his fingers and the piano keys is one of the most poignantly romantic pieces of music to touch the hardest of hearts anyone has ever heard! You  can tell just what he must be feeling just from the sound of the music. (I replayed this part over and over several times the first time I saw this movie).  This film is one of those that you are likely to feel skeptical about at first, but will turn out to be one that you are ultimately glad you got just because of the feelings and emotions it will invoke in you through the music.  It sort of puts you in the mind of the movie, \\"Somewhere In Time\\" with Chris Reeve and Jane Seymour with the music of Rachmaninoff, but without as good a story to go with the music.  I hope my review inspires you to go out and rent/see/or buy the movie.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|'The Emancipation of Mimi' is intended to provide evidence of the fact that Mariah's voice has returned to the forefront of the music industry.  The title of the album suggests that Mariah has found a sense of freedom through her music and despite the derogatory comments that critics have continously sent in her direction, Mariah has dispelled rumours that she has damaged her voice or that her work as an artist has lost the breathtaking edge that made her the music icon she claims to be.  Mariah has reached a point of self-actualisation because for the first time in a long time she has created an exceptional album of R'n'B and hip-hop inspired tracks that showcase the outstandng and rare talent that embodies Mariah as an artist.   <br /> <br />The promotional material that accompanies the release of this album claim that this is the Return of The Voice and to some extent Mariah seems to be producing vocal performances that are to the same standard of her earlier efforts such as 'Vision of Love' and 'One Sweet Day'  In the 90's Mariah was in her prime and no other artist with the exception of Whitney Houston could match her singing career.  But in the 2000's Mariah's populatity declined and many people quickly suggested that her place at the top of the charts was over.  She suffered a nervous breakdown and this saw Mariah's determination & confidence disintegrate along with her Diva status.  However, Mariah has proved that she has longevity and she is not intimidated by the unprecedented success of the present day diva's Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez. Mariah has experience and record sales in the range of one hundred and fifty million that act as a catalyst to drive her forward.  Mariah has found her creativity and used the glass-shattering instrument that is her voice in order to divert attention from the modern day artists like Ashanti and now has the world focusing on her every move.  She has managed to secure her place in music history and Christina Aguillera & Kelly Clarkson have clearly been influenced by her elastic vocals and the way she projects her voice. <br /> <br />The album opens with the infections made-for-the dancefloor 'It's Like That' This track introduces Mariah's new image the image of Mimi her alter-ego who serves the purpose of showing her supporters a different more personal side to Matiah.  The single is commercial and is specifically aimed at MTV viewers who would take notice of the radio-friendly track.  The lyrics show a confident, relaxed and care-free Mariah who is self-assured.  This attitude allows Mariah to do what she does best and that is create chart topping albums and to dominate the mainstream music charts.  This track deserves recognition for successfully enabling Mariah to make the crossover from the singer who found fame by recording heartfelt ballads to a performer with an urban touch.  'We Belong Together' is a highlight of the album due to the silky smooth vocals and expert production work.  A modern day love ballad is a way of desrcibing the track and Mariah manages to display emotion but she doesn't make the mistake of being too over the top and dramatic.  Her voice sounds as origina and exciting as it did when she first launched her career.  The lyrics are intelligent and simple yet painstakingly crafted to the point of perfection.   <br /> <br />If you are looking for material that shows Mariah collaborating with the most respected and influential artists in Hip-Hop, look for Snoop Dogg & Kanye West & Jermaine Dupri & Nelly & Twista for an example of Mariah sounding amazing, fresh and contemporary.  The beats and bass lines throughout the handful of stunning songs sound as if they have come straight from a Kelis album and she is renowned for her funky and innovative style that is unlike other singers.  This could be because some of the production is left to the neptunes.  Mariah sounds totally at ease and not at all out of place in the new direction she has taken throughout the album.  In true hip-hop style she emphasises her wealth and prestige and sex appeal and she has the status and reputation to do so.  She really seizes the opportunity to branch into a new genre. <br /> <br />If you want to hear her impressive vocal range look for 'Fly like a Bird' and 'Mine Again' which have her trademark audacious vocals.  She is a powerhouse and her voice is in full force as she puts her soul into the music. Mariah's voice has changed and she can still create a masterpiece with her extraordinary gift-her voice.  She may be more concerned with the lucrative music market and in light of this it explains her commitment to producing standard and up-to-date music as opposed to more meaningful records.  But she is evolving and few singers can compete or challenge the superstar.
0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha is the story of a Brahmin's son, set in India. He leaves his father to become a samana - basically itinerary ascetics. His friend and follower, Govinda, joins him in his journey. Siddhartha tries to free himself from his ego. One day, he meets Sukyamuni, the Perfect One, the Buddha. He exchanges a few words with him and feels a soaring love for this Perfect One. The Perfect One enlightens him, although Siddhartha feels he does not want to listen to Teachings anymore. His friend, Govinda, decides to become one of the Buddha's disciples, and so Siddhartha is now alone in finishing his quest for Peace and Truth. At this stage of his life, he pursues the worldly pleasures that he has for so long denied himself. He meets a beautiful woman Komala, the great merchandiser Kamiswami, and many others that aid him in flattering and enjoying his senses. Komala teaches him about the love of a woman, Kamiswami teaches him about business. Soon, Siddhartha indulges himself with fine garments and sates his hunger with delicious foods.<br /><br />Then, days find Siddhartha with a sense of disgust, shame, and the feeling that he has lead a senseless, meaningless life by indulging himself with worldly pleasures. Here, the powerful climax of Siddhartha emerges as Siddhartha continues, once more, his quest for Peace, Truth, and Spirituality.<br /><br />The profundity of this book, the beautiful, powerful words, the imagery it conjures up, the eloquence in which everything is conveyed - it was delightfully amazing. It really made me think about life from a totally different perspective, which was different but also wonderfully refreshing. I can tell that Siddhartha will be a memorable novel for me. Years from now, I will think back to reading this book and how it made me feel.<br /><br />Siddhartha is an intelligent, profound, and ultimately wise book. This is a must-read for anyone who is interested in Buddhism or spirtitualism or just philosophy. This book may be small, but don't underestimate it because of its size - it holds more power and meaning than most thick books do.ll, but don't underestimate it because of its size - it holds more power and meaning than most thick books do.  <br />
B0000042MY|5.0|Absolutely wonderful.I think most of the people here will agree that this is a great soundtrack.This is the most moving and beautiful score that I've ever heard.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I've read many mixed reviews about this movie, and I wanted to watch this movie myself to see what the mixed reviews were about. I have to say that I'm glad that I purchased this movie. I really liked this movie and would recommend this movie to any true Disney fan. I know that this movie doesn't exactly match the true story of Pocahontas, but I can't think of any other Disney movie based on a fairy tale or story of some sort that does match the story of fairy tale exactly. This is a great movie, and the movie is highly recommended by me.
0780631684|5.0|Final Destination is fun,scary,and it keeps you going the whole time!!!!!! When a bunch of student aboard this plane for France this boy has a premonition of the plane blowing up!!!!! Then he wakes up and says something and gets kicked off and then the plane explodes!!!!! Even though this kids got off the plane death is still around the corner for them!!!!! This movie is awesome and if you like thrillers or even horror movies then you should check this one out!!!!!!!

B000A6T1KE|4.0|This Star Trek film, while not the greatest film, is a cut above Star Treks 1 and 5.  When I saw this film in the theaters, I didn't like it very much.  But as I watched it on DVD, I began to see some good aspects to the film.  The one aspect of the picture I didn't like was the kid who played Shinzon.  His acting left much to be desired.  But as you look at the Next Generation characters, many of them look inside themselves to give good performences.  Although Data dying wasn't nearly as emotional as Spock's, it allowed the audince to realize how important Data is to the cast.  The film also has some fantastic special effects, and a killer space battle that rivals the Wrath of Khan's ending space battle.  Again, for those of you who are thinking, \\"What's this joker taking about?\\" let me state that I think Star Treks 2,4,6,7,8,and,9 are vastly superiour films, but at least this film is better than 1,3,and 5.
B0009MAO46|5.0|When I learned that the 10th Anniversary edition of this movie was coming, I knew that I had to get it. I had seen it when it 1st came out on video because a teacher I had bought it for a family member on VHS and wanted to make sure the tape worked, so we got to watch it in class. I really enjoyed watching it when I saw it for the 1st time, and I knew that I had to get it. I would recommend this movie to all fans of the Disney/PIXAR films and to all fans of computer animated movies.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City with Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba is a great flick!!!! The movie is really cool,because they filmed in black and white,but they put patches of color with i thought was brilliant and different!!!!!! Sin City is a place with all kinds of different people living in it that tell their own stories within the Sin City!!!!!!! This movie is a must watched movie and the first time that you don't understand it make sure that you really watch the different characters and how they tell us about their pasts!!!!!!! The movie has a great cast and a awesome story line and its just a great flick!!!!!!
0780624890|5.0|Blade is an outstanding, fresh, sexy, kinetic thriller.  This film is quite possibly the best of the recent Marvel films. It also stands alone as a fresh take on the typical \\"good guy kicks butt\\" action films.  Wesley Snipes is outstanding in his portrayal of Blade, and the film is not just another \\"superhero come box office revenue grabber\\" flick.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is familiar with the story of Blade, or to anyone who is looking for a great supernatural thriller.
1559409002|5.0|The special effects are cheesy. The \\"surprise\\" is no surprise. And yet this film holds the attention far better than most films with far fewer obvious klinkers and on far higher budgets.    The film's premise is the same as in \\"Siesta\\" and \\"Sixth Sense\\": the heroine is dead. She doesn't know she is dead. That premise is not obvious in \\"Sixth Sense,\\" becomes obvious in \\"Siesta\\" when the protagonist jumps from a roof, but is obvious here early in the film when she emerges out of nowhere from a muddy river after her car overturned and fell into it three hours earlier.    Our dubious heroine then embarks on a journey interrupted by visions of the dead and demented. Though thoroughly cheesy, the images of the un-dead are effective, and the owner of the boarding house looks as though she recently escaped from an asylum. The disorientation that the film-maker would have us associate with death is chilling. When the \\"secret\\" is revealed at film's end, the breathing of the two obviously living actresses is a welcome relief, and a fitting end to one of the best \\"stinkers\\" on film.    This film is very much like a good ride at a carnival: nothing to ponder for long, but a marvelous ride. The Criterion print is superb as usual.
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica's fourth album was their first without original bassist Cliff Burton and with his replacement, Jason Newstead. But, when you listen to \\"...And Justice for All,\\" I wouldn't blame you if you think Metallica didn't even hire a replacement for Cliff, because this frontman James Hatfield and drummer Lars Ulrich had a hand in this album's production and mixing. Thus, this album had very loud guitars and drums, but the bass was barely audible. The other flaw with this C.D. is its production sounds very skimpy.<br /><br />Fortunately, the musicianship and songwriting more than make up for the flaws. This album is considered by many fans to be this band's best. Like Metallica's first three and fifth albums, \\"...And Justice for All\\" is a classic from beginning to end, and it's worth buying just for the singles (\\"Blackened,\\" \\"Harvester of Sorrow,\\" the title track, \\"Frayed Ends of Sanity,\\" and, especially, one of Metallica's best songs ever--\\"One.\\")<br /><br />1. \\"Blackened\\" begins with an ascending guitar noise, but this song is very catchy because, after the drums kick in, both of the guitars chug fast. Meanwhile, Lars is thumping on his double bass and snare drums. A nice, fairly long guitar solo is also included.<br /><br />2. The title track begins with soft, almost acoustic sounding guitars. The drums and power chords eventually take over and make a pounding sound. The beat slows down but becomes heavier near the end, and there's also another solo (which is even better than the solo in track one).<br /><br />3. \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" has chug and churn riffs which ascend in volume.<br /><br />4. \\"One\\" is one of Metallica's best songs ever! It begins as a power ballad, but it subtly and greatly gains momentum, volume, and speed, and around four and a half minutes in (during the bridge after the third chorus), the thunderous double bass drumming and almost machine gun riffs make the song heavy. This song is very catchy and very famous for this moment, when James yells \\"Darkness...imprisoning me!\\" Lyrically, I believe this song is about a soldier who's dying in a war.<br /><br />5. \\"The Shortest Straw\\" features slower, but still exceptional (and booming) guitar riffs.<br /><br />6. \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" has more thunderous guitars and thudding drums, but becomes an almost staccato beat.<br /><br />7. \\"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\\" begins with a few slow riffs, but it takes an unexpected turn when it becomes a stop-start rhythm and some deep voices come on and sing \\"Oh-eeh-oh...\\" Then the actual song, which is one of the fastest on here, begins, with more catchy chug and churn riffs. I enjoy this song because the entire middle is instrumental.<br /><br />8. \\"To Live is To Die\\" is all but instrumental. It begins with almost classical sounding guitar strums. Then the electric guitars fade in and play some chunky riffs. A 45-second long guitar solo sprouts up, and the vocals make an entrance seven and a half minutes later (!) The song ends, though, with the same acoustic guitars that began it.<br /><br />9. \\"Dyers Eve\\" has some great drumming, but the real highlight, here, is the very thrash, old-school-ish, rip-roaring guitar riffs.<br /><br />In conclusion, this C.D.'s flaws are easy to overlook when it sounds this great. Of course it's great, and of course it's essential listening for all metalheads--it's Metallica!arkness...imprisoning me!\\" Lyrically, I believe this song is about a soldier who's dying in a war.  <br />5. \\"The Shortest Straw\\" features slower, but still exceptional (and booming) guitar riffs.  <br />6. \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" has more thunderous guitars and thudding drums, but becomes an almost staccato beat.  <br />7. \\"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\\" begins with a few slow riffs, but it takes an unexpected turn when it becomes a stop-start rhythm and some deep voices come on and sing \\"Oh-eeh-oh...\\" Then the actual song, which is one of the fastest on here, begins, with more catchy chug and churn riffs.

068987474X|5.0|I read the entire book last night and loved it.  A very quick read and a definite \\"must have\\" for any single woman.
0671799320|4.0|I first encountered this book in connection with a recent family trip that included a stop at the museum in Titusville, Pa. where \\"Colonel\\" Edward Drake first discovered oil in 1859. Oil was back then, possibly somewhat like the computer industry today, quite speculative and a town like Pithole, Pa. could go from boom to bust in a single year.  The biggest drawback of this long history of oil is that it ends in 1992 with the 1st Gulf War, so it isn't truly current.  It has nothing about the second Gulf War or subsequent events in Iraq or America's current problems with Iran or North Korea.  But as a thorough history of oil including its connection to wars, cultural clashes, and world politics, it is an impressive and scholarly work, somewhat similar possibly to the historical novels of James Michener .  Not only does it cover many of the industry's colorful early wheeler-dealers,wildcatters, promoters--the most notorious of whom, arguably, was the Armenian Calouste Gulbenkian (\\"Mr.5 Percent\\")-- capitalists and CEO's on an international scale, but it is also quite thorough on the motivations and maneuvers of OPEC in the book's last half as they relate to economics and national self-interest. The PBS series is also good and certainly more concise. He discusses the theories of important economists like David Ricardo and E.F. Schumacher, who defended coal over oil, as they pertain to oil. It is methodically thorough on the history of the discovery of oil particularly in the Middle East, as well as in America, Venezuela,Indonesia, Russia, the North Sea, and Alaska. It also covers most of the 20th century's major American, British, and Middle Eastern and  even Far Eastern politicians, negotiators,events, and sheikhs and the important military figures of the two world wars as they relate to oil, so in many ways it reads well as pure world history and politics.  FDR's and Churchill's meetings with King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia; the machinations of the Shah of Iran,earlypro-Communist strikes in Baku in southern Russia, the Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq and 2nd Gulf Wars particularly stand out. The coverage of the importance of oil in the two World Wars in the 8-part PBS television series of the same name is quite good, I thought, so I avoided these sections, to some degree, when I picked up the book.         I thought Yergin was suitably sympathetic to OPEC--not too long ago, Saudi Arabia was little more than a stopover on Islamic pilgrimages to Mecca-- while perhaps being too much of an apologist fot the oil industry overall, and giving too little weight to alternative technologies, which he does cover in several chapters.  But with the glut of oil up to the present  largely a result of Middle Eastern oil and America's love affair with the automobile,  the interstate highway system, and suburban living these new technologies have so far proved to be somewhat irrelevant, with the possible exception of fuel efficiency standards and emissions standards in cars.  The new technologies have come up in times of crisis or oil embargo, like 1973 or 1979, when conservation was all the rage, only seemingly to be quickly put on the back burner when the oil began to flow again.  Yergin does devote some pages to the \\"new\\" environmental consciousness, particularly in the PBS series. As a baby boomer I didn't fully realize that up until the early 20th Century, approximately until Churchill's decision to switch the British Navy from coal to oil prior to World War I, and the invention of the internal combustion engine and the airplane--that the major fuel of the industrialized nations was coal, then for several decades, kerosene for lighting.  In my life, I've taken the switch to oil pretty much for granted. Oil, which is much cleaner though also much less abundant than coal, seems to be on a par with electicity and medical advances as one of the benefits of modern life. Overall the book is less about the technological advances than about the people, world events, and economics involved.  I read it somewhat as a reference work, picking it up over a period of two weeks and choosing chapters somewhat at random, and usually enjoying the excerpts I read.  It increased my understanding of the Arab-Israeli conflict,of Middle Eastern values and history,of  Soviet influence in the Middle East,  and of the colonialist policies of the British Empire and its eventual demise, with the advent of political figures like Gamal Nasser of Egypt, Iran's Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, and 3rd World sympathizers like Italy's oil CEO Enrico Mattei who sought to break the stranglehold of the \\"7 Sisters\\" Oil companies in the Middle East and offered a better deal to the producers. Notable also is that there has been a trend away from vertical integration among the major oil companies for several decades--whereas John D. Rockefeller pioneered in his Standard Oil Company by combining oil drilling, refining, transportation, and marketing, there has not been a new refinery built in the U.S. since the 1970's.

B0000000LI|5.0|I bought this CD about 4 years ago, and never really appreciated all the music that much - just liked 'Until the Last Moment' and 'One Man's Dream'.  Then, I bought the DVD last month (watched it almost every day).  Since then, all the music haunted me; love them all! I don't get tired/don't mind listening to it every day. I wish Yanni could have included 'Felitsa', 'The End of August' and 'Aria'.  The live version of these music sound more magestic.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I'm a book person.  I always like the book better than the movie EXCEPT on this occasion.  I think this movie was the best movie of the three (the book was the best of the first three books, too) and I think the movie truly added some spice to the already wonderful story.  The author of the books is so great, but in certain areas, the movie version of this book was better.  The way things played out in certain areas of the movie were just awesome.  Especially the confrontation at the Shrieking Shack.  I loved it.  This is truly a great movie, a great adaptation, and a wonderful story.  I reccomend the book and the movie.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|I took my five-year-old daughter to this last January.  I was not very excited about doing so; Christmas was over, and I'm not a huge fan of children's fare or big Hollywood productions or any movie that has an acclaimed \\"major star.\\"  I'm especially repulsed by special effects and so-called technological \\"advances.\\" I'm one of those espresso-drinking independent and foreign film guys.  But, my little girl wanted to go this thing, so I had to oblige.    Folks, almost from the get-go this movie captivated me.  It truly is visually spectacular, dreamy, surreal even. The story itself I found very gripping; this train-ride the movie depicts is just wild, if not fully psychedelic.  There are all kinds of magical and mystical sub-plots going on.  The North Pole depiction is incredible.  There are various little points made throughout which have pleasant humanitarian principles. The movie emphasizes compassion for others in ways that should really affect children positively.  I left the theater enthralled; I spoke of and thought of the movie for much longer than my daughter, who also loved it.      In fact, here I am writing this review in September.  The movie has kind of lingered in my subconscious for the last nine months.  There is no doubt that this movie will obtain \\"classic\\" status; long after Nemo and Monsters, Inc. and all these other animated movies fade into obscurity (a prediction I make based on the sheer volume of these movies nowadays; I can hardly keep track of them all; it is cuteness and cleverness overload at our local theaters)this movie will surface as very special.  I'm buying this for MY collection; my daughters will be merely allowed to BORROW it, provided they don't touch the disc with their little fingers.  I want them to watch this a hundred times, but I want it in good shape for me to watch some more as well!      Bottom-line: Incredible.  Awesome work by all involved.
B0006L16N8|3.0|OK, I might have made a massive mistake, but I begun my Coldplay collection with \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" and a few days later got \\"X&Y\\" with \\"Parachutes\\" totally out of the picture, but I liked the singles from both albums and the singles off \\"Parachutes\\" didn't appeal to me like the others did so I ignored it.<br /><br />I liked \\"A Rush OF BLood To The Head\\" and fins myself listening to the usual songs,In My Place,Clocks,The Scientist etc, I like that album. When I Got X&Y the opener \\"Square One\\" didnt appeal to me A lot, I really liked the singles Speed OF Sound and Fix You, those are what made me get the album, and its not a case of everything else is totally different, they are all same sounding but they have there own induviduality to them. In 2000 I hated Coldplay and I never thought I'd get theier album 5 years on, but when the album X&Y delivers, it really delivers such great tracks include:<br /><br />What If<br /><br />White Shadows<br /><br />Fix you (!)<br /><br />Talk(!)<br /><br />Swallowed In The Sea<br /><br />And yes, Speed Of  Sound (even though it sounds like they are ripping themselves off or desperatly trying to make \\"Clocks 2\\")<br /><br />For some reason I Dont really like listening to:<br /><br />Square One<br /><br />X&Y<br /><br />Twisted Logic<br /><br />The other tracks are really so-so.<br /><br />I have been pondering to get this for awhile and all the reviews were basically<br /><br />60% Great album<br /><br />40% Dissapointed<br /><br />I feel mixed on this album, I love some parts and get bored of some, but for a new Coldplay fan I guess its all cool.<br /><br />I think I have made a mistake of really not being an early fan or embracing Parachutes and A Rush... when it came out.<br /><br />But for an X&Y fan I guess there OK<br /><br />Im a sspanking brand new fan so anyone else new, try to listen to previous material before getting this. Maybe thats why I fell so lukewarm about this.<br /><br />Best Tracks:<br /><br />Fix You<br /><br />White Shadows<br /><br />What If<br /><br />Speed Of Sound<br /><br />Swallowed In The Sea<br /><br />Talk<br /><br />A Message<br /><br />Wouldnt call them worst but the \\"ZZZZZ\\" tracks:<br /><br />X&Y<br /><br />Twisted Logic<br /><br />Low<br /><br />The Hardest Part<br /><br />Weirdly Im still finding myself listening to A Rush Of Blood to The Head a bit more than X&Y...<br /><br />Quite Reccomended for Coldplay fans and new Coldplay fans.he Sea <br />Talk <br />A Message <br /> <br />Wouldnt call them worst but the \\"ZZZZZ\\" tracks: <br />X&Y <br />Twisted Logic <br />Low <br />The Hardest Part <br /> <br />Weirdly Im still finding myself listening to A Rush Of Blood to The Head a bit more than X&Y... <br /> <br />Quite Reccomended for Coldplay fans and new Coldplay fans.
B000002TYX|5.0|The ANTHOLOGY series is definitely not for the casual fan. But for any true Beatles fan who grew up in the Sixties awaiting each new release, this first volume in the series presents a treasure trove of musical memorabilia from the Fab Four's genesis as the Quarry Men through 1964, when they spearheaded the British Invasion and forever changed popular music.<br /><br />Disc 1 begins with the much ballyhooed \\"new\\" recording \\"Free As a Bird.\\"  It is a stunning track performed by Paul, George and Ringo recorded in 1994 using a 1977 John Lennon demo.  Since the remaining tracks date from 1958 to 1964, this track seems out of place on ANTHOLOGY 1, but the advance hype of this song didn't allow for its delayed inclusion on ANTHOLOGY 3.<br /><br />What makes this first volume special is the historical importance of many of these tracks.  While the sound quality is marginal on some of these recordings, where else will you find anything by the pre-Beatles group the Quarry Men or any Beatles tracks with Stu Sutcliffe on bass or Pete Best on drums?<br /><br />Most of the rarities are on Disc-1. Here are the previously unreleased highlights:<br /><br />\\"That'll Be the Day\\" / \\"In Spite of All the Danger\\":  A 1958 recording by the Quarry Men.  [Note: The latter track was written by McCartney-Harrison.]<br /><br />\\"Hallelujah, I Love Her So\\" / \\"You'll Be Mine\\" / \\"Cayenne\\":  Home tapes featuring the only known recordings with Stu Sutcliffe on bass.<br /><br />\\"Searchin'\\" / \\"Three Cool Cats\\" / \\"The Shiek of Araby\\" / \\"Like Dreamers Do\\" / Hello Little Girl\\": Five songs from their 1962 Decca audition.  Pete Best is on drums.  The latter two tracks were Lennon-McCartney originals that they never recorded after securing a contract with EMI.<br /><br />\\"Besame Mucho\\" / \\"Love Me Do\\": From their initial 1962 EMI session produced by George Martin.  Both tracks feature Pete Best on drums.<br /><br />\\"How Do You Do It\\":  Brought to the group by George Martin to be used for their first single.  The session features Ringo on drums.  The song was eventually scrapped in favor of \\"Love Me Do.\\" [Note:  But labelmates Gerry & The Pacemakers would have a hit with it.]<br /><br />\\"One After 909\\":  A 1963 attempt at a song that would not resurface until 1970's LET IT BE.<br /><br />\\"Lend Me Your Comb\\":  A 1963 BBC recording that was not included on 1994's LIVE AT THE BBC.<br /><br />Disc-2 contains fewer unreleased rarities:<br /><br />\\"Moonlight Bay\\":  a comedic number performed in 1963 on \\"The Morecambe and Wise Show.\\"  The boys ham it up with the show's comedy duo.<br /><br />\\"All My Loving\\":  The live performance from the Beatles' historic first appearance on \\"The Ed Sullivan Show\\" in 1964.<br /><br />\\"Shout\\": A 1964 live performance of the Isley Brothers' song that never made onto another Beatles' recording.<br /><br />\\"You Know What To Do\\":  A demo of a George Harrison original from 1964. The song was never completed.<br /><br />\\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\":  Recorded for inclusion on BEATLES FOR SALE, Lennon provides the vocal on this cover of a Little Willie John number.<br /><br />Technically, all of the tracks on this collection are previously unreleased; but the above tracks represent mostly songs that were never released in any form until the release of ANTHOLOGY 1.  The rest of the tracks are either live recordings or alternate takes.  None of these songs are presented in their original released studio versions.  So if you're looking for the recordings you remember, you'll be disappointed.

B00005HYHG|5.0|Between March 1962 and June 1965, the Beatles performed on 52 BBC radio programs recording a total of 88 different songs-36 of which never appeared on disc.  With the release of LIVE AT THE BBC, 56 of those performances are presented for the first time, including 30 songs that had never appeared on an official Beatles' release.  [Note:  Quality recordings of the Beatles' four 1962 appearances do not exist and were not included.]<br /><br />These radio broadcasts provide the listener with a close-up look at the growth of the most influential band in pop music history.  While the Beatles routinely included their current hit singles, the real treats are the songs recorded by their early influences.  There are five previously unreleased recordings of Chuck Berry covers, a couple Little Richard songs, as well as songs by Carl Perkins, Ray Charles, and their only recording of a Buddy Holly song (\\"Crying, Wishing, Hoping\\") other than \\"Words of Love.\\"  Of special note is John's vocal performance on Arthur Alexander's \\"Soldier of Love.\\"  There's also the only recording of the Lennon-McCartney tune, \\"I'll Be on My Way,\\" which was given to Billy J. Kramer & The Dakotas.<br /><br />In addition, there is plenty of unscripted banter between the Beatles and the program hosts, which adds a dose of humor to the proceedings. Unlike the ANTHOLOGY series, LIVE AT THE BBC can be enjoyed by neophyte and hardcore fans alike. ESSENTIAL

0739313118|5.0|Wow.  What a fun book.  I whimsically picked it up without planning to read the whole thing.  I just wanted to see what was in the first chapter.  It was definitely captivating.  I not only read the whole  book, it was hard to do anything else but read the next chapter.  What a grand ride.  Dan Brown is a fabulous storyteller.
B00000JNO2|5.0|Excellent. This album was made after a bad period for Skynyrd when they were admittedly partying way too much most of the time. They knew it was time to get their act together and this was almost a comeback album from the wreckage of the past. Gimme back my bullets was a vailed reference to getting back on top in the music industry and a lot of effort went into this album. Great production value and sound quality, Skynyrd at thier best. This one is easily as good as Pronounced.
B000002UDG|4.0|What's not to like if you admire catchy melodies,big hooks, and stellar vocals????  This collection has a solid taste of Mccartney's flair with that musical pen from the broadway style melodrama of \\"No more lonely nights' and \\"My Love\\" to epic blockbusters like \\"Live and let die\\".  You'll find the rockin' \\"Band on the run\\" which shift changes like a wild chameleon from a breezy pop tease to a foot stompin' anthem and then there's the fist pumpin' adrenaline kick of \\"Jet\\".  You will also find Macca's jubilant collaboration with the gloved one (before the insanity hit) on \\"Say Say Say\\" and the easy listening pop of \\"With A Little Luck\\" which concludes with those signature revved up Little Richard style vocals.  This set will also delight with its inclusion of the cruising rock cool of \\"Junior's farm\\" and the sappy yet irresistable pop charm of \\"Silly Love Songs\\" which is highlighted by Macca's  lyrical virtuosic bass lines.     Now it all makes for an enjoyable listen but what were they thinkin' when they decided not to include Macca's best rocker \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\"?????  I find it hard to comprehend but it is the case so Macca's record company needs to wake up and enhance this old collection with \\"Maybe i'm amazed\\" as well as some other classics that happened before and long after this set was released like \\"My Brave Face\\", \\"Figure of eight\\", \\"Getting Closer\\", \\"Here Today\\", and ESPECIALLY \\"Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five\\" which is one of my personal fave's.  Let's hope they can really make a collection that lives up to the title instead of giving us more of the same...
B00005B5L4|5.0|I was surprised to find that of my DVD-A purchases, this album was among those that benefited most from the new format.  The multiple channels were used to great effect and added strong new dimensionality to the music.  Not among my favorite albums, but among my favorite DVD-A's.  A great listening experience.
1400076943|5.0|This is a terrific book across the board.  Well written, never self indulgent, to the point, poignant and incredible up to date.  It has is it all.  It tells the story of a rich family in a country that is being torn apart by civil war.  It never brings politics to the foreground, but everything revolves around it.  The family is the revered by most in their community but they hold a tragic secret and somehow they have to find a way to live with the consequences of it.  A must read for searious readers who love reading something a little more intense than a regular Grisham novel (which are fine as well mind you, but this one is so powerful you won't be able to put it down).

B00063MBU8|1.0|...The answer would be none. None more Worse. [...] Hard. But onto this album. If you look up [...] in the dictionary, there is a picture of Pierre on his knees pleasuring another man right next to it. If I could I would give this album and MTV negative stars. This and rap is what is wrong with music, the fact that talented bands (COB, Shadows Fall, Darkest Hour, Opeth,In flames,Rancid, etc.) can't be on TRL because [...] don't like them just shows how lame record companys/MTV really are. On a scale of [...], I give this album 5 BJs out of 5.

The sharks break free wreak havoc.    This movie is good because it is scary and suspenseful.  LOADS of people die, which is cool.  The only downside to it is the computer animated sharks.  They don't look very real.    Overall, a cool movie and great to watch!
B00005JODA|5.0|Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) is an average British Diplomat who ends up falling in love with and marrying a rebellious and politically aware college student named Tessa. During his assignment in Africa, Justin notices his wife is doing something but doesn't understand what political activities his wife is involved in until after she and a friend of hers are brutally murdered. He uncovers an investigation Tessa was conducting involving pharmaceutical companies handing out drug treatments to sick patients in Africa which is part of a test they are conducting to ward off a potential tuberculosis epidemic down the line. Tessa discovered not only are the drugs contributing to patient's deaths but also that high-level U.K. goverment officials are allowing this to go on with full knowlege of the drugs' questionable nature. This top-notch movie is very well acted, well written and well directed. I like the grainy look the director is known for as well. I could not help but notice the similarities in light on the goings on with doctors prescribing AIDS-related drugs to HIV patients in which the treatments, like AZT, end up killing the patients they are prescribed to. In most cases it is done with government sanction. For more of what I am talking about, please see the excellent documentary \\"The Other Side of AIDS\\" or the book written by Christine Maggiore \\"What If Everything you Knew About AIDS Was Wrong?\\".

Police cheif Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close the beaches, but mayor Vaughn refuses because he doesn't want to put off the tourists.  After several deaths, Brody, Ahab fisherman captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and icthyoligist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) head out to kill the murderous white pointer. <br /> <br />This movie ROCKS!!!! It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I love this movie because of the unbearable suspense and excitement it causes.  The gore is rather grisly, but that's the main part of it!  To scare the hell outta ya!  There are some scenes that make you jump and cringe, but that's the fun of it! <br />The only bad thing about it is the shark looks ocassionally fake, but that doesn't matter.  This movie is, on my behalf, almost perfect.  To top it off, the unmissable theme tune is the serrations on the tooth!!! <br /> <br />My favourite character is Quint, and Scheider is exceptionally good. <br /> <br />A must see for any shark/gore/horror fan.  See it... before you go back in the water! <br />

B00005JHCP|4.0|This movie is a great portrayal of Charles Dicken's David Copperfield. It stayed true to the book and brought the whole story alive. <br />The actors and the actresses had done well. They played their characters like how they were as described in the book. Maggie Smith's acting was clever as usual. It felt like the role of Aunt Betsey was meant for her. Moreover, thought he only appeared in part one, young Daniel Radcliff proved that he had talents for acting. Radcliff's portrayal for young David Copperfield fit the book's description well and was memorable. <br />The costumes used in this movie were extraordinary. From the working class to the high rich class, the costumes fit the personality of each and every one of the characters. In addition, the make-up artists did a wonderful job making the actors/actresses look weak or old as the book had described. <br />It's a fantastic adaptation of David Copperfield, go get it if you haven't! <br /> <br />Story A <br />Acting A- <br />Direction B+ <br />Visuals A-

This CD has a great mix of slow and fast songs (bachata, merengue, salsa and dare I even say one particular song that's part samba). Juan Luis Guerra has such a haunting voice when it comes to the ballads and the fast-paced songs are so danceable.
B0001AP12G|2.0|kanye west while a great beat maker even though all of his beats have samples from other songs they all pretty much come out good i think this album is way overated just for the simple fact that kanye is a pretty bad lyricist while not terrible some of the stuff he says just does not make sense i would tell u to get this album if u just like to hear good beats but the fact of the matter is, is that kanye is a rapper first on this album and a producer second so he should pay more attention to his rhymes and while i dont agree with everything that kayne says because sometimes he is just blatantly racist i do enjoy some of the tracks on this album i would have to say my favorite track is family business i would say download that and just dont by this album u will be disipointed by the lyrical aspect of the album unless u r just one of those people who goes along with what everyone else likes make up your own mind this is just my opionion {and thats all that matters}

B0002S947K|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD.  An amazing voice, haunting songs, great musicianship...I also heard about Ray on CBS Sunday Morning.  My husband and I put it in the player and felt like we did when we first heard other legends.  I can't wait for his next effort and am thinking of giving this title as a gift to friends.  He's that good.

B00005214X|5.0|Hearing this album begs the question of how Lennon/McCartney could have kept Harrison bottled up towards the end of the Beatles' career.  Certainly not all of the wonderful tracks for ATMP were available while recording Let It Be or Abbey Road, but can you imagine the following exchange, Paul: yes George that \\"Isn't it a Pity\\" song you've got is all very fine but we've never had a song with an anvil in it have we?!  That's why we've got to have \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" on this one. <br />Of course there are some clunkers on this album, I can definitely do without the jams, and Wah-Wah is a bit drawn out and indulgent but on the whole this album showcases Harrison at the height of his songwriting ability, influenced by Lennon/McCartney and yet full of his unique sense of melody, not to mention interesting chord changes, and the insight that he had gained through his exposure to eastern philosophy and experiencing the dissolution of a band he had been in since he was 17. <br />This album is indeed a snapshot of Harrison at a particular point in his career.  At the same moment, he was liberated from the Lennon/McCartney domination of the Beatles, and for that matter producer George Martin's frequent disregard for his material, surrounded by friends with first-rate muscial talent, eg Eric Clapton and Billy Preston, and optimistic about the future. <br />Isn't It a Pity, Art of Dying, Hear Me Lord, Run of the Mill will give the first-time listener a taste of what was influencing this underappreciated musician when he stunned the world with this album.

B00000G3PA|4.0|WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE, I MUST SAY IT TOOK ME BE SURPRISE OF HOW GREAT THIS MOVIE WAS MADE AND THE STORY BEHIND THE MOVIE WAS AMAZING.     I LOVE BRUCE WILLIS AND BEN AFFLECK TOGETHER. HARRY (BRUCE WILLIS) PROTECTING HIS DAUGHTER GRACE (LIV TYLER) FROM A.J. (BEN AFFLECK) NOT BECAUSE HE IS A BAD BOY, BUT HARRY WANTS BUT THE VERY BEST FOR HIS DAUGHTER. HIS WIFE LEAVES THEM WHEN GRACE WAS NEAR 10 YRS OLD AND HARRY HAS TRYED TO MAKE A BETTER HOME FOR HIS BABY GIRL, ONLY THAT THIS INCLUDES A ROOM FULL OF MEN THAT HAS TEACH HER MANY THINGS, FROM LEARNING HOW TO USE TAMPONS TO THE REAL MEANING OF SEX.     THIS MEN ARE: WILL PATTON TRYS TO BE THE REASONABLE ONE BETWEEN HARRY AND AJ; STEVE BUSCEMI TEACHES GRACE PART OF THE MEANING OF SEX, DO TO HIS HORNYNESS SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHEN HE IS SERIOUS OR JUST PLAIN FUNNY, STILL HE IS SOO FUNNY AT TIMES HE JUST KILLS ME LOL LOL; OWEN WILSON IS THE FARM OWNER THAT TALKS WITH PAUSE AND MAKES YOU FEEL AT EASE; MICHAEL CLARKE DUNCAN BETTER KNOWN AS BEAR, HE IS A GREAT ACTOR FANTASTIC PERSONALITY AND VERY LOVABLE AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST KEN CAMPBELL WONDER AND BEAUTIFULL ACTOR.     BUT SERIOUSLY THE MOVIE IS ABOUT HARRY AND HIS CREW ARE PART OF A DRILLING TEAM. HARRY HAD A PROTOTYPE OF A MACHINE HE INVENTED BUT HE NEVER GETS TO SEE THIS GO THRU. IN THE MEAN TIME THE SHUTTLE IN SPACE WITH 8 ASTRONAUT HAS EXPLOTED THINKING NASA IS HIT ONLY TO FIND OUT THERE IS A HUGE DOOMSDAY ASTEROID THAT IS ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH EARTH.

ONLY THAT THINGS DONT GO AS PLAN AND SOME ONE HAS TO STAY BEHIND TO PUSH THE BUTTON AND MAKE THIS BOMB AVAILABLE TO DESTROY THE ASTEROID BEFORE IT HITS EARTH.     IN THE MEAN TIME, GRACE IS FALLING APART BECAUSE AS SHE SAYSIT, THAT IS HER FAMILY THAT IS UP THERE AND SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHO WILL COME BACK AND IN WHAT SHAPE.     AT THE BEGGINING OF THIS MOVIE, IT SHOW NEW YORK BEING HIT. THE FIRST THING TO GO WAS THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. I SAW IT AFTER 9-11 AND I CRYED A LOT, REMEMBERING WHAT HAPPEND THEN AND THIS MOVIE.     BUT ABOVE IT ALL, IT IS A GREAT MOVIE I LIKE A LOT. AND I ENJOY THE FUNNY MOMENTS THE BOYS HAVE AND HOW THEY PROTECT GRACE.
B00005JNTX|1.0|Ok...I'm seeing a lot of mentioning about the \\"double dipping\\" with the extended version coming out in December.  Most of the comments negative.  The thing is 1. maybe if people took the time to do research before buying a movie they wouldn't complain about it. It was all over the net prior to this version being released that there would be another edition coming out in the near future for the \\"true collector\\". 2. Maybe some people just want to see the movie as it was in the theater and really don't care about the extra stuff.  Heck both versions of Lord of the Rings movies still sell and they have just a regular version and a directors cut.
B000000OSE|4.0|After becoming the best band of the late 80's with the debut <br />album Appetite for Destruction, the band took 2 years to come <br />up with this album after releasing \\"G N' R Lies\\" which had some <br />really questionable lyrics. <br /> <br />Any, this is different from AFD, as it looks to go beyond the <br />more simpler and mean rock n roll. Is it as good? In my opinion <br />no... Yes it does have more versatility, but that doesn't make <br />it better. This is after all, rock n roll.... And alot of rock  <br />is simple and hard just like AFD. <br /> <br />However, there are some classics here such as the great November <br />Rain and Coma that show the band can do more than just play <br />really hard rock. I have to say though that I think this album <br />get called for alot of filler when that is incorrect. Really <br />as someone said before the sometimes longer hits sort of push <br />other good songs to the bottom. <br /> <br />Songs like the country driven \\"You Ain't The First\\" and the  <br />some times rough and sometimes soft sounding \\"The Garden\\"  <br />have become some of the more underrated songs in the GNR  <br />catalog. You also have \\"Right Next Door To Hell\\" a song  <br />that sounds like a hold over from Destruction. Not saying  <br />that's a bad thing... But that's what comes to mind.... <br /> <br />Bottomline, is that this is an album that delievers some <br />hard rock, some more tender songs, some groovy guitar work <br />and pretty much is just a good album overall. It's very  <br />clear that this album is were the friction started. They are <br />clearly pushing Axel's direction, but it still has enough <br />rockers to keep it from falling completely to Axel's direction.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|Awesome and altho that is a word often used but never true, I use it in the way it was intended. The story is so totally believable - the actors doing such an amazing job - that I was suprised when it finished and credits began to roll I was so lost in it. The scenery is breath-taking and I was all for packing up and heading out there. The music was in some parts gut-wrenching, in all parts unforgetable. The movie itself is my favourite of all time. Not least because it is authentic ... I know a smattering of Lakota and would have been disappointed if it was a 'made-up' language as so often happens or at least used to. I cant say enough about this movie. It will always be a classic and will always by my favourite. And to Kevin Costner ... bless you. <br />
B000000OQY|2.0|The questionable lyrics on \\"One In a Million\\" and the mediocre<br /><br />cover of Aerosmiths Mama Kin are really downers for me. No<br /><br />really standout tracks here. Not such an impressive effort.<br /><br />Keep the racist stuff to yourself Mr.Axel you hypocrite moron.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This is really a disgrace to the rock world. Buy the new Rolling Stones record and avoid this trash and keep your brain cells alive.
B000000OQF|5.0|It's very simple... This is hard rock with no Apology. This  album has more classic songs than most bands entire catalog!    What makes it so great? Well, it all starts with the twin   guitar interplay of Slash and Izzy Stradlin. No twin attack   like this had been since since Aerosmith's prime back in the   mid and late 70's. Axel has a Compelling voice just that fits  with the attitude of the band, despite his flaws as a person,   he remains one of the best frontman of the late 80's and early 90's.    The album is a hard rocker basically through the entire album.  Even when it gets alittle softer,(Sweet Child)it doesn't fall  prey to the type of ballads that was successful, but cheesy   in the 80's. It's album that goes all the way through it times  when it became more and more about hits with filler.    Really not alot you can say about each song... It sticks pretty  close to rocking out mean and nasty all the way through, no  matter if it's hate toward woman, or hate toward the worsening  inner city.    It rivals Black and Black, Justice For All, and Fair Warning  as the best albums of the 80's IMO. Songs like Welcome To The  Jungle, Mr. Brownstone, Sweet Child O' Mine, and Paradise City  are the classics... But songs like My Michelle, Night Train,  and Rocket Queen are just a step below being classics...
0790729342|5.0|This movie has capitvated me since I was in the fifth grade as a kid. My buddy and I saw it edited on TV and had to see the real deal.  <br />The muscle cars, the heroic character of Max, the setting, action, all makes for a real genre of movie that had never before been viewed.... <br />The Max character develops so much in this movie unlike the stupid Thunderdome.  Mad Max, which I love, didn't show us the depth of Max that Road Warrior reveals.  He is a bitter person, an angry person, a loner.  But by the end of the movie, his humanity drips out as does his heroic spirit.  He gets railroaded pretty bad in the movie, which often happens to heroes.   <br />The chase scene at the beginning of the movie blew me away, the camera angle coming down on the Ford flying down the highway. I'll never forget the first time they showed it and then you see that white stripe in the middle of the road flying 100 mph at you.  Wez, the insane mowhawk lunatic pursuing Max (played by Vernon Wells, no, not the baseball player, another actor lol) is truly perfect for the part.  The chase scenes are perfect, the acting is great, etc. <br />I really love the atmosphere of the survivors trapped inside the oil refinery.  It's very clostrophobic, nerve-wracking, and affective.   <br />This movie set the standard for the modern day action film in so many ways.  It was an instant classic with me...still is. Buy it!
B000000OSG|4.0|This second album is alittle more serious than the first <br />and more inconsistent. You have the classic Civil War that <br />is in my mind the best Guns N Roses song that isn't on  <br />AFD... You also have \\"Estranged\\" that is to this album like <br />November Rain is to the first album. <br /> <br />You also have the underrated Breakdown that provides  <br />more constant from Slash than most of Guns N' Roses tunes.  <br />I think this album has some underrated songs that get lose  <br />in the shuffle because of Civil and Estranged... 14 years  <br />gives that groovy type of guitar work that Dust N Bones had  <br />on the first album. Also, I think So Fine is an underrated  <br />song that reminds me of the \\"Knockin On Heavens Door\\" type  <br />of feel. <br /> <br />Overall this is another good album, but it's pretty clear  <br />that the end was near. I think the band was running out of <br />idea's and grunge was starting to take full effect. Who <br />knows how effective GNR would have been had they continued.
B00003CXI1|5.0|If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you just as well would enjoy the film version. Well, at least I did. <br /> <br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very magical film. I loved it. The first time I saw it in theatres, I thought it was incredible. It's witty at times and even wonderful at times. I thought it was just the fantasy everyone needed. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br />As fans know, the first installment of Harry Potter is about the young wizard discovering that he is a wizard and is sent to a school called Hogwarts where he meets friends and teachers and becomes sort of a wizard-celebrity because many thought he vanished Voldemort, the guy who gave him a famous scar and killed many, including Harry's parents. <br /> <br />The film is a bit too dark for anyone under eight, but I liked this film. For the record, I do not think Chris Columbus ruined Harry Potter because the sets were wonderful. They were exactly the ones readers would imagine if they ever read the book. Columbus, who I am actually a fan of makes the magic of Harry Potter. This is one of my favorite films from the director of family comedies. He kind of breathed life into the Harry Potter at the movies. <br /> <br />The acting is pretty one-dimensional. Daniel Radcliffe stars as Harry Potter - even though probably note the most convincing actor out there, he is actually pretty believable and looks a bit like the imagined-Harry Potter. Rupert Grint is pretty good as Ron Weasley, Harry's best friend and sidekick. But I think the one that really shot through the audiences is probabl young Emma Watson who plays Hermione Granger, Harry's other best friend and female sidekick. The three is pretty good together, walking through the corridors. Looks pretty natural, though. I like the threesome and I think Columbus is pretty good at directing children. <br /> <br />The British-supporting cast is pretty good, with the exception of Richard Harris who I believe is Irish?Anyway, I loved Maggie Smith as McGonagall and of course Alan Rickman as Snape (turst me, he is super-funny). I also liked Julie Walters (one of my favorite actresses) as Mrs. Weasley. The cast is just wonderful. I loved the cast. <br /> <br />I have seen the film six times so far and I still love it. I won't mind watching it again because it's really wonderful and it's one of my favorite recent fantasy films. It's a magical films and I am guessing many audiences would enjoy it because it's really just-what-you-imagined. Many fans have complained that the first film is a bit sugarcoated, but I still like it! The sugarcoating is done pretty good and it doesn't piss off the readers. Overall, great film, and not a one to be missed.
B00004LN16|3.0|It's not close to the prime AC/DC of the 70's and and early  80's. But did you really expect that? Since Back In Black, the  albums have only had a few good songs on each one. Why expect  anything more when they are 50 years old?    Ok, NOTHING here runs with anything from the early albums, or  nothing is better than Thunderstruck or Money Talks from Razor's  Edge.. But there are some good stuff here like the Title Track.  It's a catchy song with some good riffs from Angus, and it's an  ok headliner.. Can't Stop Rock In Roll is a solid tune aswell  that reminds me of Rock N Roll Ain't Noise Pollution...    A few other decent songs such as Safe In New York City. It  has Angus doing some good catchy guitar work, but I warn   you not to listen to it too often because the lyrics are on  the repetitive side. The last remaining good tune is Satellite  Blues... Granted most of it is good and catchy guitar work,  but the lyrics aren't all that terrible.    Bottomline, these guys don't have the ability to put out a  complete album that is good. They can probably come out with  a few more albums with a couple of good songs on each, but  you can't expect anything more.    Download the 4 tunes listed above off Itunes and skip the   rest. That's about all you need.    PS: Not alot of use in crying about Brain Johnsons vocals.  They haven't EVER been good. Mutt Lange made them sound good  on Back In Black, but they never were strong. Notice how  they started sounding bad after he was no longer the producer?
B00006AUIG|4.0|I bought this movie off of amazon after reading something about it.  It's a completely unknown, psychological thriller that I couldn't find in any Blockbuster or Roger's Video, so I decided \\"why not?\\" and paid 15 bucks for it.  Much to my surprise, it ended up being good.  I haven't seen a movie that has genuinely scared me in years, mostly due to the fact that most horror movies tend to work off of the \\"something-jumps-out-and-says-boo\\" template.  While this movie had a few of these scenes, they seem somehow different from the norm and actually made me feel uncomfortable and kept me up at night.  However, the main way of bringing fear to the viewers is through the building of tension and the calm before the storm, which I have always loved.  Overall, I would have to say that this movie could have been better if it had been a bit more frightening, but as far as horror movies go, it's one of the best I've ever seen.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|I loved this movie.  I always like movies with complex plots where you have to think hard about things to get the entire picture, which this one provides in spades.  The writing and directing is fantastic, and the acting, particular Jake Gylenhaal in the title character, blew me away.  The deleted scenes really add something to the final product, but the special features are pretty average.  This is a must-own.

B00007BHOE|5.0|Slipknot is definitely one of those bands that in all honesty is best seen as well as heard.  If you find yourself simply listening to the CD and have no idea what the band image is all about you might not capture the point.  Quite honestly I was not a big fan of their music at first since I lean more towards the traditional genre.  Yet when I saw this concert DVD I knew that this was a band that I had to see in person.  This double DVD Set delivers all of the intensity and antics that you can enjoy outside of the pit and in your own home.  There are some unique camera angles done as well as some footage being shot from inside the masks of the Slipknot members.  The show was filmed with 30 cameras at the London Arena to a sold out crowd.  To define a Slipknot show as live chaos would be an understatement but I think it comes very close to that for when they hit the stage it is explosive.  The eight member group are all over the place from the start and I honestly cant imagine how a band like this rehearses and gets the show down to a science.  They just simply do it and feed off the audience.  Singer Corey directs the swelling crowd who hang on his commands while the maniacal Sid works his magic on the DJ Tables.  Ordinarily I find all these bands with DJ's to be unnecessary yet Slipknot show you that it can work in some context.  There is a very interesting solo by Sid which is as non-conventional as the band themselves.  The sound quality and visuals remain at a constant throughout the whole DVD.  It is actually difficult at times to follow what is going on, since so much is happening at the same time.<br /><br />Another interesting solo to experience is the drumming power of Joey Jordison.  His technique and stamina are to be commended as with lightning speed he executes a drum solo that expands upon the stage antics first started by Tommy Lee (Motley Crue).  The DVD Set also includes the bands videos that were released up to this time and features a large amount of backstage and rehearsal footage.  As the group wears masks on stage, any images of them without them are blurred to protect their identities.  This DVD is affordable and comes in a nice slim case.  It's a high recommendation for the diehard fan as well as the curious and unaware.  It is a DVD that will not leave you the same as when you began.

B00005K3OT|4.0|CHOCOLAT surprised many cinematic biggies when it was nominated for five Oscars including Best Picture, and rightfully so.  While it is a handsomely filmed and charming movie, only the manipulations of Miramax honchos forced its way into the Oscar elite.  Lasse Hallstrom infuses the film with luscious cinematography and a strong sense of romantic fantasy.  He also elicits some marvelous performances from his talented cast:  Juliette Binoche as the mysterious chocolatier; Alfred Molina as the self righteous and lonely mayor; Carrie Anne Moss as a charming widow who carries a torch for Molina and a heavy hand in relations with her son and mother (Judi Dench in a cranky but touching performance); Hugh O'Conor as a young impressionable cleric; Lena Olin as the abused wife of cafe owner Peter Stormare.  Johnny Depp has a smaller role as the romantic interest for Binoche, but one figures any actor could have played the role and Depp's rich talents are underused.  The still lovely Leslie Caron brings a touch of class in a small role as a grieving war widow.  Rachel Portman's score is lush and evocative, and while CHOCOLAT is lightweight fare, it's still a testament to Hallstrom and crew for their tight professionalism.
B000003TAR|1.0|If In Utero doesn't make you wanna score some heroin, shoot up, read Hunter S. Thompson, and hobnob with Johnny Depp, then you're not good enough to be listening to it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is an amazing show.  While I admittedly missed its original run on television, I was captivated by the show when I saw it on DVD.  So much so, I purchased the series myself!  It is filled with drama, humor, romance, intertwined plot lines, and more humor.  It is Joss Weedon at his best.  I watched some of Buffy, was (and continue to be) a huge fan of Angel, but Firefly is without a doubt Weedon's shining star.  It is too bad that the show didn't get more than a shortened one-season run.  The story line is riveting, and becomes increasingly complex and interesting as the lives (current and past) of the crew of Serenity are revealed to the viewer.  The characters start out believable, but become even more so.  The very best part, however, is the sharp and sometimes biting humor laced (Joss Weedon style) throughout the episodes.  You'll find yourself on the edge of your seat, and laughing at the same time.  My hope is that the movie based on the series (Serenity) may draw enough fans to possibly lead to a re-release of the show on television.  If you like sci-fi, westerns, comedy, and romance, then you should try Firefly.  It is definitely a remarkable mix of them all!

I find, that even though I know the outcome, I anticipate the meetings of Lizzie and Mr. Darcey and their interchange. Such clever writing. Wouldn't we all love to be able to express ourselves at the right time in the right place, such as they did. The costuming and locations were the best I have seen in a period film.  I am now going to read the book for the first time.
B00025ETIW|1.0|MCR is guilty of being the latest fad to garner mainstream success and acceptance from the teen population despite relative lack of talent. Disco, New Wave, Mallcore, and now this commercial brand of Emo are all fads that more or less die off when their fans grow up. The bad news is that this sort of music will continue to pollute the airwaves forever, but the good news is that this particular fad will die off in five years or so. This commercial tripe isn't even really emo, Fugazi was emo. I digress. As for the music, it's just what I'd expected. Poppy, angsty, and without much musical substance. Even the solos are pitiful, barely better than the leads regurgitated by Cobain on Smells Like Teen Spirit. If you're between the ages of 12 and 16 and think you're the most misunderstood individual on the planet, then buy this disc. If not, look elsewhere for music with some substance to it.

0767903862|5.0|I read this novel shortly before I embarked on a, as yet unfinished, quest in Sydney 5 years ago. Since then a scarcely a month with go by without me thinking about this book. This is classic Bryson comedy in a lucky country. <br /> <br />Australians love this book because it shows them reasons to be patriotic that go beyond the sport and the weather/beaches. Bryson's enlightened and quirky view of the world provides ample reason for Australians to be proud.  <br /> <br />Travellers/Foreigners will love this book because it is simple and written from a perspective that most westerners have faced at some time or another. You are in a foreign country, but it feels like home. All the signs are different and the culture is strange, accent is odd, yet you could easily be in a different town near where you grew up. <br /> <br />Bryson's unfailing ability to humourously state the obvious is, as always, outstanding in this book. Well worth a read.

078681859X|5.0|Despite how many time people have already compared it to Harry Potter, I shall do so as well.<br />First of all to start off, I must say that the magic used here is quite different from the magic used in Harry Potter. Also, the atmosphere in London is much more modern than compared to how it seemed in Harry Potter. Then came the matter of the magicians... In the trilogy, they are described to be powerhungry and cold-hearted, to want nothing than to be on top of everyone, while the witches and wizards of Harry Potter rather differed in ambition and goals.<br />However, I enjoyed the fact that Nathaniel wasn't some bold, heroic, and unnaturally admirable kid. You can see right away that when the only people who ever loved him in his life disappear, he's slowly turns more and more into what Bartimaeus's picture of a magician. At the end of the book, you wonder if he's going to turn into that hero that fantasy books always seem to include. People may not like the thought, but the fact that Stroud chose not to go all cliche on us is certainly appraisable, definitely something dangerous that some authors would decide not to do.<br />Bartimaeus. Here's a character whose elements I've never read in any book in my life. Witty, sarcastic, hilarious, smart, cocky, and still prone to mistakes, his chapters were the best. With entertaining and informative footnotes (in which, I did get tired of some when I got really immersed in the book I just wanted to continue with what was happening,) while carrying his task out for his beloved master Nathaniel, the excitement never runs out if you have the right sort of mind for this book.<br />The story rolled on surprisingly smoothly, for a book whose author elected to have the events percieved in two different ways. Something, if you read as I reccommend, you should find out quickly enough. <br />A fantastic book. Amazing.

0792833260|5.0|The first time I heard about \\"Rain Man\\" I just said \\"Ok,I may watch it!\\".My mother,however,insisted on me doing it as she had already heard so many good reviews about the film.Thankfully,I listened to her and checked the film out. <br /> <br />  The plot was great-I liked the way how dramatic and funny moments go together in the movie making the audience cry in a moment,then giggle.The story was good enough to make me realize some things at an early age(As far as I remember when I watched the film for the first time I was 11-12 years old).Now,I am 18 and still come back to it very often. <br /> <br />  The cast is out of a question.A very good performance by Tom Cruise(I am not a huge fan of his,but still I admit he can act).When it comes to Dustin Hoffman the only comment I can make is he is one of the best actors of all time.His performance is SUPERB!He is one of my favourite actors and I have seen many of his films.Not all of them,unfortunaltey. <br /> <br />  I have to go now,so I can't write all the things that I want to write,but I am quite sure you got the general idea.Go to the shop and buy the DVD!You won't regret it!Bye! <br /> <br />                                        Take care, <br />                                            Sisi
0553565915|5.0|I am writing this review based on the original hardcover edition published by Gold Leaf Press in 1992.<br />Not only are Betty J. Eadie's words written so beautifully, she explains in great detail the universal \\"laws\\" that we are governed by, and gives a clear account on the process from her death experience to returning to life on Earth.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of this book is how prayers are answered, and in what order. She goes into great detail showing how our deepest, most sincere, heart-felt prayers \\"shoot up like lasers of light beams\\" and are \\"immediately answered\\". Then there are the prayers that are said in rote, without any feeling - these are not even heard, and thus are not answered. In addition, our most sincere prayers need only be said once, we don't have to keep asking over and over again, or beg, plead, \\"bargain\\" etc. They are answered according to what is really for our highest good.<br /><br />Eadie goes on and literally brings to life the vivid picture of what it is like on the other side, and how the Angels gladly respond to every call. The beginning of the book clearly describes her transition to the other side, and I KNOW this account is for real, because on a personal note, what she describes in this book is the identical experience my own mother had in 1964 when she `died' giving birth to my sister, and the identical things my mother described to me are what Betty describes in this book, including being greeted by Jesus Christ.<br /><br />I read this book from cover to cover in one sitting, and before writing this review, I read a lot of it again. Eadie writes so beautifully and eloquently, and this book is really a pleasure to read. It is soft and wise. Interesting and insightful. It brings wonderful messages that anyone can benefit by, and is a beautiful contribution to the NDE genre.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and if you are really into this subject, another book that would be great with this one is `Saved by the Light\\" by Dannion Brinkley. Each book gives unique and vivid accounts from Earth to the Other Side, and back, along with the messages they are to bring to humanity in their `mission' on Earth.<br /><br />Barbara Rose, author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to being THE ONE, and If God Was Like Man<br />Editor, inspire! magainzeEach book gives unique and vivid accounts from Earth to the Other Side, and back, along with the messages they are to bring to humanity in their `mission' on Earth.

B0007GAERG|3.0|The Emancipation of Mimi finds Mariah Carey coming back strong and returning to her mid 1990's glory.  Ms. Carey's voice is in first rate form and the song selections fit her style.  The album starts off on the wrong foot with the Jermaine Dupri produced \\"It's Like That\\", but rebounds nicely with the strong threesome, the megahit \\"We Belong Together\\", the follow-up hit \\"Shake It Off\\", which even better than its predecessor and the even better still, \\"Mine Again\\" which has a sleek & sexy neosoul groove.  It wouldn't be a Mariah Carey album without a guest rapper and Snoop Dogg shows up on the solid \\"Say Somethin'\\".  The best track on the album is silky \\"I Wish You Knew\\" which has tight production, punchy horns and a powerful, but not overstated vocal.  The album has shown that Ms. Carey can once again be a major commercial force.
0517543052|1.0|Like many others, I read this in college and was sucked in.  However, reading \\"Ringolevio\\" later I uncovered the Richard Alpert used the same approach he used in B.H.N. to promote a beatific vision for drug use prior to his India trip.  In other words, the message was the same, the theatrics were the same - only this time a unique journey through India offered him a new pedestal upon which to preach from, one that made him feel 'special'.  Why would someone wish to actively seek such world acclaim.  Perhaps the answer lay in my also having met his boarding school master from when Alpert was a teenager.  From this older man's own words, Alpert was gay and felt forced to hide it - one must remember the times he lived in back then.  He was, however, also very much ostracized by his fellow classmates for possibly this very same reason.  In short - my amateur interpretation: a teen with a secret, lonely and shunned, seeks mass approval later in life, and a solution for stifling his own inner demons - first through an incredibly heavy use of drugs, which he openly pushes in an effort to make society more like him (so that they might like him more), and later through a pseudo eastern philosophy, that he pushes using the same tactics he used before when he pushed his (addictive & DNA altering) drugs onto others.  I attended several of his 'spiritual' retreats and, to my surprise, found his compatriots insulting and intentionally demeaning to those of us who attended looking to them for answers.  But the most revealing was when one time Mr Be Here Now was asked a serious question and, after an embarrassing silence, Dr. Alpert/Ram Dass admited he didn't know the answer.  And that, when he didn't know, he admitted that he often made up an answer, but in this case, he couldn't even think of an answer to 'make up.'  And I thought, why am I sitting here being treated this way, listening to a man who is knowingly lying to us.  I got up and left.  Some time later I sat next to a woman on a plane who's own mother used to help Dr. Leary distribute drugs to his college students and others when they lived up in the country.  This would have been after Dr Leary had been fired from Harvard.  She was his right hand in passing them out.  This woman shared that her mother, now older, lives with a sense of remorse that, after all those drugs they took, that she still feels no closer to God or her own inner spirituality.  I suspect the same may be said about anyone who followed Ram Dass from when he preached a pseudo spirituality mixed in with admitted lies.  Part of why I had been so pulled in was Dr Alpert's credentials.  Had he not been a professor at Harvard?  And even from Dr Leary's own autobiography, wasn't his being fired from Harvard for political reasons more than that he pushed LSD onto his students?  One must respect 'the' institution, right?  Yet, in the past year, Harvard's very own president has insinuated that females may have an inherent weakness when intellectually competing with men.  Re; this book and those times: strip away the 'feel good', explore what is really true, and then move on to something that's a lot more honest, I would humbly suggest.man on a plane who's own mother used to help Dr. Leary distribute drugs to his college students and others when they lived up in the country.

B0009XT8YW|3.0|Guilty was released in 1980 when both Barbara Streisand and Barry Gibb were at the top of their profession.  The result is the most commercially accessible of Ms. Streisand's career.  Mr. Gibb's production might be the best of his career. The lead single, \\"Woman In Love\\", is slow and seductive track that hit number one and ranks as possibly Ms. Streisand's best.  Mr. Gibb duets on the title track and the better \\"What Kind Of Fool\\".  The album turned out to be a major success, hitting number one and became the best selling of Ms. Streisand's career.

B000A3DFZE|2.0|Back Home finds Eric Clapton espousing on the joys of being at home with his family.  While he deserves domestic happiness, the album harkens back to his worst commercial instincts.  Sounding very much like the MOR sounds of his worst efforts like August and Pilgrim.  The album has a professional and over-produced sound that is perfectly made for Adult Contemporary radio.  The one highlight is The thoughtful and loving cover of Mr. Clapton's good friend George Harrison's \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\".  It is an obscure album track from 1979's George Harrison album and Mr. Clapton puts his heart into and it is a touching tribute to Mr. Harrison.  Too bad the rest of the album lacks this loving touch and feels like a bore.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|First of all this album is wayyyy differen't than A7X's previous albums. Like theres not very much screaming. I did like there album \\" Waking the Fallen \\" but i think City of Evil blows it away...... the guitar solos , the drums ,  just how well everything is in sinc, and how they put so many diferen't types of vocals and guitar playing into a song yet still make it sound so good is AMAZING. They could work on there vocals though,  but just the musical element totally makes up for it. The song \\" the wicked end has some pretty good singing in it. I liked Avenged Sevenfold before and i like them even more now......buy this cd!!!
0694013889|2.0|I just bought this for my daughter to help spark an interest in potty training.  This book is boring, in it's word use, and illustrations.  The language used is also strange: \\"we we\\" for the urethral opening, and \\"hole\\" for the anal opening.  It just sounds odd to me.  My daughter and I love \\"The Potty Book for Girls\\".  It's much more interesting, and langualge use is more acceptable (to me anyway).

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|You do not necessarily have to be a Tim Burton fan to enjoy this movie.  Big Fish brings out the creative, but not overly imaginative side of Burton.  He created in depth characters that you have to love because of how personal they are.  Big Fish touches a sensitive side in most people.  I never cry in movies, but Big Fish feels so real that certain parts seemed like they were really happening in front of my eyes.  Burton has a magic about his movies that is untouched by any other director, it would be absurd to not see this movie.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Never mind the biting , haughty review in the accompanying list of reviews. For all who, 'shall we venture, survived this era that the Eagles represent=<br /><br />this is a prize to keep and cherish. Here are some wonderful musicians and five part vocalists playing and  singing their hearts out for their loyal fans. The trials by fire that some of them have gone through only served to refine them like silver in the fire. Joe Walsh made a huge impression on me, obviously having overcome some grave difficulties in life. I paid more attention to his performances than I ever had noticed before.<br /><br />but all the performers were just magificent. I hooked up my single end vacuum tube amp to listen, and that served to bring out the vacuum tube amp stack sound that is heard, usually, only live.<br /><br />This farewell one tour DVD ( we can only hope for farewell two!) is one you absolutely do not want missing from your collection!!<br /><br />If this performance didn't please you, perhaps you should stick to your humperdink and manilow genre.
0060574216|1.0|The most sexist, biased, silly, unfounded, unhelpful waste of time to come from a publishing house in many a moon. This supposed relationship enhancer is the biggest example of playing with a loaded gun since the serpent in the Garden of Eden offered marriage advice to Eve. I know this is now a cult hit but I wonder how many relationships this exercise in stereotyping has busted up? Gray would have us accept that humans are without variation walking examples of either Martians or Venuvians. JMJ, but who on earth falls for this hogswallow? Apparently a lot of people by the sales numbers.<br /><br />Gray would like to make us think all men are confrontation-seeking warriors who reason at waist level. (Actually only half of that statement is true.) He makes a case that men dwell on this plane to spread their DNA, make quick, simple decisions and scratch themselves in public. Women, the less than sage Gray wants it know, are emotion-driven machines turned on and off by nesting instincts, the desire for endless communication and a snuggly need for flattery and security. We are supreme manipulators employing sex as the coin of the realm in the marketplace of romance.<br /><br />This book has all the depth of a three-panel Sunday comic strip.<br /><br />Unfortunately rather than going through the talk show circuit and dying a natural death in the 1990's, I saw a new edition of this was out since the one I read for a class. \\"Updated!\\" it proclaimed. What, Gray's going to admit we've evolved a little and are now in the stone age instead of the protoplasmic mating pool he seemed to think we all lived in when he first tossed this inflammatory little cartoon on us?<br /><br />Yeah, this book makes me miffed. Not much but enough to invest ten minutes in slamming it in a review. I could laugh it off but the fact it's given credibility is what bugs me when I take a moment to think about it. So, once I'm done reviewing this, I won't think about this book again. See, watch: What am I thinking about now? Something else.h: What am I thinking about now? Something else.

0553208845|4.0|If you are expecting the exact tale of the Buddha in this book, as you may have heard it before, that's not what is in here. Herman Hesse has given the story a different and quite entertaining turn. The book is written very elegantly and the story makes it a page-turner. The author definitely knows his stuff quite well, as is apparrent from the depiction of the scenes based in ancient India and the picturesque account of the different kinds of people in those times.<br /><br />The characters are very well personified and there is a consistent theme in the book throughout.<br /><br />What you should not expect out of this book, is too get a hang of Buddhism or Buddhist teachings and principles. Buddhist teaching is touched here but only very slightly. I feel as if this is an account of what the author had learned from his life till the point that he put it in the book, relating it to the ancient Indian and Buddhist era, but that's my feeling :)<br /><br />All in all, an insightful and definitely entertaining read!

0895260131|5.0|In this book Robert Spencer shows that Islam is a false satanic religion.  Islam is about violence, lies and destroying the true people of god (christians and jews).  Spencer shows that the what Islam teaches is that all muslims have an obligation to conquer, enslave and destroy christians and jews.  Islam is terrorism and Islam will always seek to destroy the true followers of god.  He further shows the lies the PC gang running America has taught about the Crusades.  The Crusades were a defensive war to save christian civilization from islamic slavery.   <br /> <br />As in earlier books, such as \\"inside Islam\\", Robert Spencer compares the violence satanic language of Muhammed to the truth of Christ which shows the lie that Islam has anything to do with \\"people of the book\\". <br /> <br />Robert Spencer is a great man who has helped bring many muslims to the truth of Christianity.  He sits on the board of the respected Christian-Islamic Forum and has co-written \\"Islam revealed: a guide for catholics\\" with the Forum's leader Daniel Ali as a guide and help-book for those working to help people escape from the evil that is Islam to the truth of christianity. <br />
0893815233|4.0|i need to reiterate the point made in a previous review: this is not the place for opinions, personal values, or an ethics discussion. people who read these reviews for the purpose of trying to understand the contents of the book are not interested in these things. this book contains some very well-renowned photographs, an essential for those who already appreciate sally mann's work or are interested in learning about it for the first time. i highly reccommend this along with \\"At Twelve\\" for some extremely compelling and powerful documents of photography. Also, whoever thinks these photographs could be taken with a $200 camera has clearly never used one before. These were taken with an 8x10 view camera, which is incredibly difficult to master, as Sally Mann has done, largely without any professional instruction. That comment just demonstrates the reviewer's ignorance about photography in general and does a disservice to anyone reading these reviews seriously. This book is a fine addition to a serious photography collection.

I feel in love with all of the characters. Kip is my favorite. I think that this is a film that shows how people envision themselves. As one reviewer stated, Napoleon ( and Pedro for that fact) does not see himself as a geek.He does what he does because he is Napoleon. Some of my favorite parts are with Tina the llama ( I don't know why-I guess there was a time when we all hated to feed the pet llama), and any scene with Kip especially Kip and Lafawnda. This movie is a wonderful fun film. Don't take it seriously.

B0008ISM40|5.0|Nine Inch Nails have come a long way since Pretty Hate Machine with Trent Reznor at the helm.  Trents latest offering in the Dual disc format of &#34;with Teeth&#34; takes this brilliant album to the next level - especially if you're like me and like to hear music coming from all six channels in your home theatre setup.  This same format of Downward spiral was also just as appetising with clever use of surround mixing adding a further depth and complexity - enabeling the listener to hear things otherwise less audible in the standard CD version.  With Teeth in this Dual disc format has all the elements to make you go &#34;wow, thats sounds awesome&#34; - even my wife said the same thing - having a good ear for sound.  This is a must have for people who want either all of NIN's stuff or just like to hear good music on a 5.1 sound system and fill your lounge room with auditory delight!!  Not much can be said though for the visual side of things on this release with only mere glimpses and teasers of previously released works - but don't discount it on this alone - just great for the sound.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Listening to this cd is a real joy. First because it is an amazing album by an amazing band who deserves the opportunity offered by major labels. Second because i can already hear the intellectuals trying as hard as they can to take all credit away from plans now that death cab has signed to a major label. Reaching the point they did on an independant label is impressive and now with plans, their best record in my opinion, the band really established itself has the leader which will bring indie rock to the masses. From begining to end this album is incredible. Every song seems to put forward a different instrument, some songs are more bass oriented, while some other are guitar songs and there is a lot of piano songs as well. Ben's voice has never sounded so great. I feel bad for those who will keep themselves from fully enjoy this record based on the fact that it made them feel better to listen to their firsts records when it was more prestigious for them to mentioned death cab when they were less known. Any college student involved with the campus radio who will give this album bad review will only discredit himself.
B000002UB3|5.0|Don't start with this album if you haven't heard much of the Beatles. <br /> <br />It's not an album of hits. It's more than that. Buy Hard Days Night or Revolver for stand alone songs. Once you're familiar with the Beatles, buy Abbey Road and it'll bring everything together for you. <br /> <br />This was (fittingly) the last Beatles album I bought and it truly put the band in perspective for me. Growing up not really listening to them, but hearing everyone proclaim how brilliant they were, it was hard to imagine they'd live up to the hype. But in this final musical masterpiece, the Beatles truly show their genius. As a musician, it's completely mind boggling to try and imagine how four guys can create such a melodic, beautiful, and ecclectic album.  <br /> <br />The Beatles final goodbye to the world was a magnificent gift. <br /> <br />My favorite album of all time.
B000050XEI|5.0|While many people consider A Day Without Rain to be Enya's best album I am not that convinced. Why? Well, I think it's her simplest album in many ways. Firstly I'm not a big fan of the cover art. It's not ugly but compared to her earlier albums it doesn't looks that magical and conspicuous. The title \\"A Day Without Rain\\" is nice but it doesn't sound as poetic as \\"Watermark\\", \\"Shepherd Moons\\", \\"The Memory Of Trees\\" and \\"Paint The Sky With Stars\\". The tracks are shorter and sounds simpler then her earlier ones. The lyrics are also simpler with much \\"da da da\\" vocals and repeating refrains. You will not find many melancholic tracks and no dynamic hit like Orinoco Flow and Book Of Days. However, the best track is Only Time followed by the beautiful title track, Wild Child, Flora's Secret, Fallen Embers, Silver Inches, One By One, The First Of Autumn and Lazy Days but - as always - there are no bad tracks on an Enya album. Finally I have to say that A Day Without Rain is a great album with lots of potential hits but I prefer her earlier, more melancholic albums. Perhaps you can say that A Day Without Rain is a simpler and happier version of The Memory Of Trees? Many say that they want something \\"new\\" from Enya, but why alter a unique and winning formula that always sounds great? I really hope Enya's next album will sounds like her earlier ones and I hope we'll hear many dynamic tracks with lots of instrumental and vocal layers. I suppose her next album will be released later this year. Guess if I'm longing?!  <br /> <br />Since the horrific September 11 attacks four years ago Only Time will always have a special place in my heart and I will always remember those who jumped... <br /> <br />Here comes a short description of the tracks on A Day Without Rain: <br /> <br />1. A Day Without Rain - Instrumental; very relaxing, beautiful <br />2. Wild Child - English; great, happy, special* <br />3. Only Time - English; great, very beautiful, special* <br />4. Tempus Vernum - Latin; pretty powerful, special* <br />5. Deora Ar Mo Chro - Gaelic; beautiful, very relaxing <br />6. Flora's Secret - English; wonderful, happy, special* <br />7. Fallen Embers - English; extremely beautiful, calm and relaxing <br />8. Silver Inches - Instrumental; nice, happy <br />9. Pilgrim - English; beautiful, pretty calm <br />10. One By One - English; very beautiful, special* <br />11. The Fisrt Of Autumn - Instrumental; pretty powerful, special* <br />12. Lazy Days - English; nice, happy, special* <br /> <br />* Hard to say why these songs are special, but perhaps because they don't sound like any other musical stuff. There's only one person that's able to create songs like these and her name is - Enya. You must hear them, but don't forget to try her earlier albums such as Watermark, Shepherd Moons or The Memory Of Trees. <br />
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I am a huge fan of Tim Burton, my favorite movie being The Nightmare Before Christmas and this movie just proves the artistic creativity that Mr. Burton embodies.<br /><br />The trailers shown on TV for the movie \\"Charlie and The Chocolate Factory\\" do not do this movie justice.<br /><br />The first time I saw this movie, I was at the drive-in, and I am so glad that I was able to watch this movie in the privacy of a car because my friend and I were able to laugh LOUD LOUD LOUD at every funny moment in the movie and able to emulate many funny quotes and let me tell you, there are a LOT.  My second time to see the movie was in a theater and even though I knew what was going to happen, every funny moment still caught me off guard and made me laugh.  Johnny Depp is an excellent Willy Wonka!<br /><br />I've seen the original Willy Wonka and Gene Wilder, though a funny actor, was too scary to myself.  Maybe this is because I am not a huge Gene Wilder fan and more of a Johnny Depp fan, maybe this is because I do not understand the 70's motif surrounding the movie seeing as I was born in the 80's and saw the movie in the 90's.  But Johnny Depp is a perfectly wonderful Willy Wonka for the 21st century.<br /><br />The many quarks of every character will have you laughing and talking and copying them many times over after you see this movie.<br /><br />This is BY far the best movie of 2005 and I cannot wait for it to come out on DVD to add to my collection!
0743454537|5.0|Fabulous story.  Impossible dilemma; conflicting interests between children; a fight for self determination; a shocking ending.  Should be great for bookclub discussion.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|the movie is a sham.remove ''the scene'' and no one is even buying a ticket.raise your hand if you too can do EXACTLY WHAT GALLO DID.............LOOK AT ALL THOSE HANDS!!!!!!!(IM RAISING BOTH OF MINE!!!!)let me get this straight;the self imposed art house geniuses toss around such silliness like''bravo to gallo for brave film making!!'',''pure masterpiece!'',''unconventional film making!''....BLAH BLAH BLAH!art house loiterers are feeble.just admit you are trying to justify liking a film that uses a sexual act as its money making gimmick!im not one to give in to yes/no sessions,which is exactly what reviewing anything is,but i would like to expose the self imposed geniuses for what they are.they are equally self absorbed as shollow gallo is,thus,their fondness for the uneventfull.a few reviewers put it very bluntly....anyone of us can get out home movies,insert a controversial element and ship it off to cannes.ANYONE OF US!!!would we be considered a genius?!?!?!?!?some of us need to loosen up those pointy caps and see a movie for what it really is.in the case of the brown bunny,its one horribly boring movie.
B00006EXL5|4.0|i have to say, i like more songs on \\"three cheers\\", but i do like \\"bullets\\" better overall? its more raw and definately less polished, which makes it ultimately just so much better.  <br /> <br />anyone who likes punky screamy painful music will LOVE AND ADORE this album, and MCR in general, because, well.. its punky, screamy, and painful. im an avid fan of MCR, so i might be a bit biased, but MCR definately towers over most of the other bands in their genre because of the basic fact that they have rhythm, and they hold a tune, and everyone now and then they stop screaming and sing a little. and i mean, lets face it, the mans not gorgeous, but daaaammmnn does he know how to work an audience. i mean seriously.. orgasmic.  <br /> <br />best songs on the album are definately demolition lovers, vampires will never hurt you, and this is the best day ever.  <br /> <br />BUY IT! or at least download it. whatever, just listen to it.
B000002UAX|4.0|The Beatles were at the peak of their powers when they set about making the \\"White Album,\\" but were also at the early stages of their fracture. It shows throughout the original LP's four sides. The Lennon/McCartney axis was clearly challenging each other, each trying to one-up the other's song quality. You can all but hear McCartney's mind gearing into \\"Helter Skelter\\" as a response to Lennon telling him he wasn't a rocker. Or George Harrison fighting to write the astonishing \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" with the intent of proving his songwriting prowess.<br /><br />This mix of classic songwriting and mad experimentation (\\"Revolution 9\\" will never cease to grate my nerves) is what keeps this CD from being five stars, though if you use my criterion that 5 stars means influenced everything that came after, I'd almost tip it up one. And the sheer number of Beatles' Greats here makes this almost irresistible.<br /><br />Pros: You Get<br /><br />Back In The USSR<br /><br />Ob La Di, Ob La Da<br /><br />While My Guitar Gently Weeps<br /><br />Blackbird<br /><br />Piggies<br /><br />Birthday<br /><br />Mother Nature's Son<br /><br />Helter Skelter<br /><br />And Ringo serenading us with Goodnight<br /><br />CONS: Being stuck with<br /><br />Wild Honey Pie<br /><br />Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey<br /><br />Long Long Long<br /><br />Honey Pie<br /><br />and Revolution 9<br /><br />Still, this is a legendary album. If you are a collector and historian, frankly, your library is incomplete without it.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I honestly dont understand why everyone likes these guys. They are unimaginitive, repetative, and boring. 'Speed of Sound' sucked, and it sounded like 'Clocks' (another Coldplay song) with a different chorus and 1 note changed. What do you Coldplay fans see in this band? I would really like to know. Is it because they are on VH1 and not MTV? Is it because they have a pianist? No it cant be. I'll try some more. Is it because the singer got his b**ls chopped off and he sounds no different from an emo singer? Or is it because they are British...yes thats it, you people like them because they are from the same nation as great bands like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Just because they are from a great country musically doesn't mean they will be good. Oh, and by the way, I'd like to know when this band will start making original music and stop ripping off U2 and Radiohead.     Coldplay = most overrated artist since Feminem
B00003BDXG|5.0|A friend recommended me this movie a long time ago but I wasn't able to see it until recently. He didn't tell me much about it, but that's probably a good thing, because I may not have watched it then. I'd pictured a noir crime drama, which couldn't be much further off. I'm not sure if artistic is the word I'm looking for, but suffice it to say that this is a very interesting film. It definitely keeps your attention. You don't really have a choice. In the beginning, I thought I was going to regret watching it, but as the movie progressed, I found that I was enjoying it very thoroughly. The psychedelic visuals and odd little extra bits make the film very...well...interesting. I can't think of any other word that describes it accurately. <br />The soundtrack was perfect. It fit in wonderfully, especially late in the movie. Superb. Highly recommended.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Was blown away when I first saw Star Wars. The dvd has 'enhanced' special effects. Some don't like them but <br />they don't bother me much. It is interesting to see how the chars relate, especially after the 'last' episodes were made <br />before the sometimes cluttered, later 'prequels'.  <br /> The trilogy holds up well, with some minor flaws. One being the lack of resemblance between the actor who played Darth Vader <br />(when Luke took his mask off as he was dying), and the young <br />Actor, Hayden C. But it was also a great touch, to see the  <br />'dead' Jedi all gathered at the end. A great surprise. <br /> I also enjoy the behinds the scenes looks and technical <br />details.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|There have been some elaborate reviews praising this movie, but.... I think these people were on drugs while they watched it. Because they can't possibly think that this movie was really good. No plot. No point. Awful acting and dialogue. No real humor. Just stupid stuff. Stupid humor usually keeps me quite entertained, as in Dude Where's My Car? and the Scary Movie series. There was funny in that stupid. But in the case of Napoleon Dynamite, the only thing that made me laugh was the fact that it wasn't funny. Just mind numbingly stupid. If you value your braincells... you will stay away from this sorry excuse for a film.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I give this five stars not because I agree with its thesis; the film is perversely fascinating, like one of Hitler's Nazi propaganda films.  It is a case study in manipulation, fact-bending, and brain washing.   It is THE ESSENTIAL BENCHMARK to follow if you're planning on becoming a dictator, despot, or other authority whose platform is built on lies and deciet.  Something here for the Moaist in all of us!
B000002UA7|5.0|Kate Bush finally brings out her greatest hits collection with the aid of one new song \\"Experiment IV\\". This new hit really adds to the magic of this collection. Even casual fans of Kate will love this album.<br /><br />It starts off with \\"Wuthering Heights\\" a new version in which Kate has re-recorded the vocals. The piano kicks it off, and from there the track just shimmers.<br /><br />\\"Cloudbusting\\" from her biggest album \\"Hounds Of Love\\" is up next with introspective lyrics and Kate brings the song home with her superb vocals.<br /><br />Although only a small 2 minutes 38 seconds the next track, \\"The Man With The Child In His Eyes\\" is one of her best songs and well loved by fans. A great piano ballad.<br /><br />\\"Breathing\\" is a very sensual track that combines a nice echo-like hook with great background vocals and lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Wow\\" is such a great song that is immediately addictive. From the album \\"Lionheart\\", this song has one of the most catchy choruses in music history and it isn't even manufactured pop!<br /><br />Starting off with a vivid spoken line the next song, \\"Hounds Of Love\\" from the album of the same name has a background sound that sounds like dogs howling and the chorus is really weird.<br /><br />\\"Running Up That Hill\\" would have to be her biggest hit overseas.<br /><br />This song is the best song on the album simply because the lyrics are so clear yet literate at the same time.<br /><br />\\"Army Dreamers\\" is the worst track on the album, however that isn't bad because it is superb just lke every track on this album. The chorus is a bit hard to distinguish though.<br /><br />With a screamy hook and crazed music the next song \\"Sat In Your Lap\\" rolls in. The sreamy hook is utterly typical Kate, alternative and rather abstract.<br /><br />\\"Experiment IV\\" is the newest track on the album. It shows off a new side of Kate that would be shown off in later albums.<br /><br />\\"The Dreaming\\" has a rather Australian feel to it with what sounds like a didgeredoo in the background, though the song only reached #48 on the UK chart it is still good.<br /><br />And the albumrounds out with the classic 80's tune \\"Babooshka\\".<br /><br />It is really gritty with the eastern influenced guitars and pounding pianos.<br /><br />This album shows off how Kate's music evolved over time and how much of a driving force and inspiration to some of today's artists like Tori Amos, Jewel, Sarah Mclachlan and Fiona Apple.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />Hiloani Kialetawhat sounds like a didgeredoo in the background, though the song only reached #48 on the UK chart it is still good. <br /> <br />And the albumrounds out with the classic 80's tune \\"Babooshka\\". <br />It is really gritty with the eastern influenced guitars and pounding pianos. <br /> <br />This album shows off how Kate's music evolved over time and how much of a driving force and inspiration to some of today's artists like Tori Amos, Jewel, Sarah Mclachlan and Fiona Apple. <br /> <br />10/10 <br /> <br />Hiloani Kialeta <br /> <br />
1400031087|4.0|...while I was in the middle of reading this book, I read some of the reviews on line - I must say that I read alot of the 1-3 stars.  The person who said this would be a 5 star as a screenplay had me thinking of watching alot of what was written and Oh my gosh....toooo painful.    Then the concept that this book is actually FICTION!!! Really.  Well, I must say I believed James.  I had some experiences similar in my youth....with alcohol and drug use. I just quit one day at the age of 28.  I decided to \\"Try Life\\" instead of fighting it.  I am not a 12 stepper, but I have MANY friends who are and I completely respect what works for others.  It didn't work for James....I believe he made a choice when he realized he had the choice.  How lucky for him that he stopped @ 23.  His story and the stories of the other people for me are believeable primarily because of my own experiences (I'm in my 50's now), and what I saw with my friends (some of who have died).  I had also just finished reading, \\"Hooked\\" by Lonny Shavelson which is also an excellent read.  \\"Hooked\\" had very similar stories as a biography of 5 people who had substance abuses and the writer followed them through 2 years of rehab.  So why the 4 star?  I am not a romantic person.  James is. Some of the romancing of the book wasn't \\"my style\\", and I do believe James' interpretation of his experiences with love was written as \\"pollyanna\\" mainly because that is the environment he was sort of raised in.  I felt he protected his parents a bit and I understand that - because in the end, they were loving parents and probably very nice people.  They are lucky too.  I have a very dear friend who lost her only son to an overdose and she will never know why...never understand her son's pain.  The Frey's got to hear from their son and respond back to him.    Well, good for you James, I'm going to read about your friend Leonard next.  Thanks for your story.

B00007ELEL|5.0|It's weird how some movies you would never expect a sequel to, gets a sequel, and the ones you'd expect a sequel from...never happens.<br /><br />The Big labowski offers a unique comedy in such a well written and portrayed way, it makes you think it was created just for you.  The chemistry between the actors, as well as the characters they play, is definately what makes this movie Great.  If any character in the movie was replaced with any other actor, it wouldn't have worked.<br /><br />The storyline isn't predictable, which is a good quality for any movie.  Always 'thinking' you know what is going to happen, and it doesn't....will keep you glued to the screen.<br /><br />Again, the movie is hilarious.  The sense of humor inside the man that envisioned this story, makes him unique indeed.<br /><br />The Big Labowski is fun to watch.  Definately a re-watcher.  It will take you away from a stressful day, for at least the length of the movie.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I first heard her while listening to Hear Music on XM Radio. Unfortunately, XM doesn't let you know who it is you are listening to....after 5 months I've found her...fantastic sound, great music...I'm in love.....
B00005JNTX|5.0|When you find yourself contemplating that there is nothing else to make movies about, along comes Sin City.<br /><br />I have actually found others who won't even watch this movie because it's in black and white.  I was leaning that direction, but had to give it a try.  And very delighted I did!<br /><br />Sin City, that although black and white, visually appears like a 3D comic book.  What color is shown, at random moments throughout the movie is ingeniously crafted to the storyline.  While spawning off into several stories, the plotline was great, and kept me hating that the movie was going to end.<br /><br />Would definately want to see a sequel to this one.  Sin City is awardworthy.
B00005JNEI|3.0|Did George W. Bush allow his business relationships with the Bin Laden family to dictate American foreign policy?  Did he intentionally lie about the weapons of mass destruction being in Iraq?  Is the whole 9/11 response in Afghanistan and Iraq really an elaborate scheme of the President to create favorable business for his wealthy business acquaintences?  Is Bush in the pocket of Saudi investors?  And the bottom line question:  is the current war in Iraq without purpose?    Those inclined to distrust Bush will love this work, and grant a quick five stars for its collage of facts, emotions, and righteous indignation, combined with winning sarcasm.  The few remaining neo-conservative partisans will trash this as a psuedo-documentary that traffics in wild conspiracy theories, and which treats with childish disrespect a very serious war and terrorist threat.  Furthermore, they will decry as unfair this very deliberate hatchet job on Bush.    My own bias is that Bush went into Iraq hoping to plant a beach head for democracy in the Middle East.  The war has proven far deadlier and muckier than expected, but hopefully a stable government can still be erected in that suffering land.    As for this work, it is decent.  As a propaganda piece, the war mom's conversion was powerful, and impossible to ignore--probably the highlight of the show.  On the other hand, even with this winning segment, I constantly felt that Moore was using everyone he encountered.  Additionally, some of the scenes were sophomoric, such as the director riding around D.C. in a truck, reading the Patriot Act through a megaphone.  His effort to recruit congressional members to enlist their children in the military also came across more as peevishness than serious commentary.    Bottom-line:  Anti-War activists should buy this movie and watch it weekly--perhaps on Sunday mornings, after singing Kum By Ya with friends.  Die-hard Bush fans should avoid this like the plague.  Those with ambivalence--probablythe vast majority--will find this an uneven, but ultimately intriguing film.

Only good band today would be Gorillaz *and for some reason I like the pillows....and they are so not the japanese verison of green day!...more like japanese verison of the beatles....great band that's out today*, most other music out there is way overrated. This no way! <br />The sounds,lyrics, everything! This is a masterpiece! Do not listen to those kids with thier britney spears, green day, and other crap they listen to! Listen to what the 5 star people say! *and i agree with some of the 4 star people* This is truly a masterpiece, not the greatest album ever *as many claim* but still a great piece of work that deserves more respect then what these people are feeding it

B000683VI4|5.0|Any moviegoer hoping to see a heartwarming tale should look no further than the 2004 hit movie, \\"The Notebook\\".  The movie tells us about Noah and Allie, the love they have for each other and the trials and tribulations they endure as individuals and as a couple.  While alternating between their current lives together and the beginning of their relationship, the audience is taken on a journey that lets us know that true love can never be forgotten. <br /> <br />In present day, Duke a.k.a. Noah (James Garner) and Allie (Gena Rowlands) are in a nursing facility.  Suffering from dementia, Allie has moments of clarity where she can remember different parts of her life, including Noah, their children and things that she once did such as play the piano.  However, during times when her memory has faded, Noah reads to her from a notebook (hence the title of the movie) that tells the story of how they met and the years following, in hopes that it will jar her memory, if only for a few moments. <br /> <br />The story that Noah tells begins in the summer of 1940 in Seabrook, South Carolina.  A young Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) meets Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams), a young socialite whose parents (played by Joan Allen and David Thornton) are extremely wealthy.  After a whirlwind romance, Allie's parents insist that she return to New York in order to attend college and leave Noah behind.  Over time Allie begins a new life for herself while Noah joins the armed forces during World War II and eventually returns to Seabrook to rebuild the dream home that he had promised Allie years earlier. <br /> <br />Will Noah and Allie live happily ever after?  You'll have to watch the movie to find out.  However, \\"The Notebook\\" proves you can focus on powerful storytelling without the glitz and glam of special effects or car chases.  With an excellent cast, you feel drawn into this compelling story and actually care about what is happening with each of the characters, whether it's good timesor bad. <br /> <br />Some movies can be confusing while switching back and forth from past to present.  \\"The Notebook\\" is not one of them.  Although you can pretty much figure out where these characters have ended up, it's a nice \\"journey\\" to see how they've gotten there. <br /> <br />One thing I wish had been added to the movie was Allie's reaction to being in New York and not hearing from Noah, even though the audience knows he's written to her everyday for a year.  We hear in conversation later in the movie that she cried herself to sleep, but we never really saw any reaction during that time.  Also her parents' reactions when she made her final decision would have been a satisfying touch. <br /> <br />For a heartwarming and enlightening story of the survival of love, make sure you watch \\"The Notebook\\".  Don't forget to keep the box of tissues handy! <br />
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|RETURN TO OZ is actuly quite a good movie.i find it to be far better then then the judy garland WIZARD OF OZ movie. mainly because it is based on the books alot more then the previous movie.<br /><br />i like the WIZARD OF OZ book alot more then the movie.<br /><br />the book has a lot more too it, and is the best of the OZ books.<br /><br />however this movie i felt was very good and kept the magic of the books. somethings are different then the books, but at least it is based on the books alot more.<br /><br />this movie takes its source from two books, and in parts uses influences from the garland movie.<br /><br />for example like the movie the real world effects the 'dream world'. the lunch pail, the wheeling cart, the doctor and nurse become the Nome King and Mombi; just as the neighbor became the Wicked Witch, the 'electracal marvel' is a machine that looks like man just like Tick Tock, and so on. allthough in the books Oz was never a dream.<br /><br />in OZMA OF OZ Dorthy first takes a second journy, this time to the land of Ev. With her is the hen Bellina. it is here that Dorthy faces the Wheelers, meets Tick Tock (here he is made by the king of Ev), journys to meet Langwidere (who changes heads) and is kept prisoner by her, it is Ozma that rescues her, and then they all go to see the Nome King who has the royal family of Ev kept prisoner.<br /><br />it is in LAND OF OZ that Ozma (turned into a boy, named Tip) is kept prisoner by Mombi, makes Jakes pumpkinhead, eventuly escapes to find the Emerald city held captive and the scarcrow usurped, and it is Ozma that reclaims the throne.<br /><br />in RETURN TO OZ Dorthy (Fairuza Balk; from CRAFT) is having trouble ajusting to the real world. she is sent off to a medical phasilty to meet the doctor (who is good old Nicol Williamson) and his head nurse (Jean Marsh), but one pationt a little girl offers her help. after a storm Dorthy is taken to Oz along with Bellina. however they find Oz is not the same as before. even the yellow brick road is gone. the emerald city is laid to waste and the people turned to stone. the Wheelers haunt the city, but the Tick Tock man offers Dorthy help. Dorthy is taken prisoner by Princess Mombi (Marsh) who has different heads. while in prison Dorthy meets Jack Pumkinhead and learns of Ozma of Oz, she also learns of the powder of life. with it she makes the Gump, which she hopes to fly her to safety. it is later that she meets the Nome King (Williamson) who has all her friends held prisoner and kept in the form of nick nacks. each of Dorthy's friends try and fail, with each failer the Nome king becomes more human. yet why is it that the king fear's Bellina and her eggs. in the end all is resolved.<br /><br />again this is a good movie for any meamber of the family.. even the yellow brick road is gone. the emerald city is laid to waste and the people turned to stone. the Wheelers haunt the city, but the Tick Tock man offers Dorthy help.

B000LZPYCI|3.0|erm... well, everyone hated the fact that David Lee Roth was kicked out of the band, well, that was until they heard 5150. Then a lot people liked this new guy... so why not do it again? If you like doing something you wont only do it once... but again, all that really matters is the music, right? well, on this album they kind of go with the same formula as 5150 but they also try and mix it up a bit. They throw in a few surprises. Like Cabo Wabo, which goes for 7 minutes. It's not progressive rock, but it's quite a complex song. And man, what a groove that baby pulls out too.<br /><br />But, the album is uneven. There is some weak songwriting. 'AFU Naturally wired' (unnaturally strange song title) is a very sketchy song. The introspective lyrics are ok but they don't save the song. 'Source of infection' is also a very sketchy song, though the chorus is redeemable. Actually I will do a song by song rundown for this album, that might work best here<br /><br />1. Mine all Mine: 1/10 an ugly song and the lyrics stink<br />2. When it's love: 7/10 a masterful power ballad that has an amazing climax, but doesn't 'feel as good' as 'Dreams' or 'Love Walks in'<br />3. AFU Naturally wired: 3/10 this song is all over the place<br />4. Cabo Wabo: 7/10 An excellent slow groove that works for 7 whole minutes, feels like a breezy by-the-beach tune, but rocks too<br />5. Source of infection: 5/10 sketchy, but has a good chorus<br />6. Feels so good: 8/10 The first real highlight, an airy ballad like 'Love walks in', though feels by-the-beach, like 'Cabo Wabo'. It gets a bit repetitive near the end and drags. Would have given it 9 or 10 otherwise.<br />7. Finish what ya started: 9/10 Another highlight, this time acoustic rock with excellent vocal harmonies<br />8. Black and blue: 10/10 A lanky, swaggering mid-tempo rocker that typifies hard-rock, as well as digging out an awesome groove<br />9. Sucker in a three piece: 5.5/10 A generic hard rocker, not too bad, though<br />10. Apolitical Blues: 4.5/10 kind of an afterthought<br /><br />This album is more of a collection of songs, or a singles collection, rather than an album as a whole, hence why it works better to do a song-by-song run down.<br /><br />because there are some average songs and because it's uneven, this album is worth about 2.50 or maybe a little bit more. Because of variety I rounded up.lbum is more of a collection of songs, or a singles collection, rather than an album as a whole, hence why it works better to do a song-by-song run down.    because there are some average songs and because it's uneven, this album is worth about 2.50 or maybe a little bit more.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|I had heard about Oldboy for a couple of weeks or so and I went to rent it and on 4 different occasions they were all rented.  So when I finally did rent it I must say I was very happy.  This movie grabs you and doesn't let go.  You start to feel for the characters all of them at some point or another despite some of there motives.  And the guessing and wondering keeps you glued in you want to know what is going on so bad.  I loved this movie and am going to go purchase it asap.  It's a shame that all of the good movies seem to be foreign films Hollywood is horrible all they produce is garbage I dread to see what they do to this film which I heard they are remaking.  Probably Collin Farrel as Oh Dae Su I definitely can say with 100 percent certainty it will not do the film justice.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Green Day were never a political band, they never cared about what was going on in the world - Billie Joe just sat around plucking things out of his nose and watching saturday morning cartoons while thinking of something non important to write about, thats his style..  <br /> <br />And now Green Day come out with this politically charged album? he all of a sudden gives a sh_t? I dont think so, im not buying it...  <br /> <br />Green Day made a political album because they knew for the moment it would be commercially successful - In fact, I wouldnt be surprised if Green Days record label wanted them to make a political album, its whats selling nowadays... but whereas bands like Pearl Jam, Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead, etc... were always talking politics in their songs.. Green Day seemed to decide on this for commercial reasons, not caring reasons  <br /> <br />The overdramatic cheese of such videos as 'Wake Me Up When September Ends' proves to me Green Day are trying way too hard.... not only that, but Boulevard of Broken Dreams is just a lame song... how short of an attention span do you have to have to enjoy that song? He says \\"walk\\" 25 times in that song, which means if you listened to that song 4 times, you wouldve heard the word \\"walk\\" 100 times... maybe your brain is small enough to be entertained by that, mine isnt.  <br /> <br /> <br />** RECENTLY GREEN DAY WON 7 VMAS FOR THIS ALBUM, DURING THEIR ACCEPTANCE SPEECH, NOT ONE MEMBER MENTIONED THE WAR, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A POLITICAL ALBUM **  <br /> <br />So they can speak out on their album, but when it comes time to step up and really do it, they back down? Green Day are cowards and pathetic. 'Wake Me Up When September Ends's entire video is an anti-war concept, yet they say nothing when accepting 7 different awards... do you think theyre sincere? Think about it  <br /> <br />Yeah, theyre pretty phony.  <br /> <br />When it comes to REAL punk rock and politics , I recommend sticking with the 2 proven classics  <br /> <br />The Clash - London Calling  <br />the Sex Pistols - Nevermind the Bollocks  <br /> <br />Green Day are men in their mid 30s still wearing eyeliner, and people say theyve \\"matured\\".... America truly is a nation of idiots
B000003N7R|5.0|The review by R. Davis best summarizes it for me. I can't listen to this album enough.  Every song is great, every performance is great.  The most improbable matchup creates amazing magic.  The last tune, \\"The Feeling of Jazz\\", is as good as it gets.
B00025ETIW|3.0|all I can say is that my chemical romance was kick ass until teenage preppy girls listened to them to be cool and started calling them \\"mcr\\" they ruined them for me. buy their first cd. preppy girls suck monkey balls for ruining this.
B0009X7664|5.0|This movie is like a magnet to just about everyone I know.  As soon as you say the title peoples eyes light up and they always say \\"I LOVE THAT MOVIE!!\\".  It's rare that a movie has such universal appeal that even my nephew who was seven at the time he saw it loved it and wanted to see it again.   I remember watching this when I was young.  It was so dark and there was such an air of seriousness (I was too young to realize everything happening in it) and the kids were literally so much like kids in my neighborhood accents and all.  The mystery of Boo Radley scared me silly but I couldn't help but watch it.  All I knew was that Gregory Peck was a dad that was too cool for words, who reluctantly shot a rabid dog in the street and who had a voice that would go right through you.  It left such an impression on me.  Especially Scout in the ham suit! <br /> <br /> Later when I actually knew what was happening in the movie.  I fell even deeper in love with this film. The relationship Scout and Jem had with their father was wondrous and moving.   There was such an air of admiration for Atticus from just about everyone.  Gregory Peck's performance as the widowed lawyer with 2 kids showed the strength, grace, dignity and vulnerability of Atticus Finch during the trial and aftermath of Tom Robinson the black man accused of rape.  Mary Badham's performance as the mischievous and willful tomboy named Scout who lovingly reminisces about her mother with her father is so pure and innocent.  She and her brother Jem's decision to make the town recluse come out of hiding is a fateful one that will forever change their lives.    The book was a masterpiece and although the film couldn't possibly include everything that was in the book all is forgiven because the film is a masterpiece in it's own right.   <br />

0151008116|4.0|Typically, books without much dialogue bore the poo out of me, but the best parts of LIFE of PI are the ones without dialogue--the horrible tension between Pi and Richard Parker kept me flipping pages well into the night. Don't let the name fool you! Richard Parker is a 450 pound Bengal Tiger.<br /><br />I had a much better appreciation for animals after reading this book. I have a lot more respect for my cat! The novel explores many themes, including animal behavior, faith, and the importance of dominance and submission in an animal's (and human's (as is the case with PI)) chances of survival.<br /><br />When I finished the book I cried. The book made think hard about the human condition. Why is it that someone might commit suicide because he loses his job? While another person, who has just lost his entire family, will do ANYTHING to stay alive?<br /><br />It will make you see your place in the world. All you have is your life in the end. In the grand scheme of things, you're not as important as you think you are.
B00009W0U4|2.0|I watch this film with eager anticipation and was pretty anoyed in the end. This film does nothing else but have two scenes of extreme violence that have mades echoes around the film world in order to make a name for the director. There is nothing really that stands out to make it a great film. The camera spins around carelessly and the plot of the story has no real applasable complexity. Some friends go to a party, a couple have an argument and the girl decides to leave them there, she gets raped on the way home and then her boyfriend and ex-boyfriend go and kill the supposed rapist. Oh and they use wavey music and its told backwards. The other thing I found unrealistic was the bit where the lady is raped in the middle of a subway, I think any would be rapist would not commit a crime like that in the middle of a public place, it an unrealistic script and quickly thought out. In all fairness though the acting is really good and realistic, you really think what is going on in front of you is actually happening. It was another film I was hoping to be out of this world and was just pretty average, When are people going to make films like taxi driver again!!!
B000A3DFZE|2.0|The original songs are completely unmemorable and nondistinctive. The whole album comes across as monotone. Of all the George Harrison tunes, he picks the most syrupy. Of all the Stevie Wonder tunes, again, relatively bland given the depth of Wonder's catalog. The covers, regardless, are overwhelmed by the overriding blandness of the whole affair. This is too bad. Clapton's vocal chops are in excellent shape. His singing has become very soulful, but his overall production approach glosses over the potential soulfulness of this material. Again, I'm not expecting power chords and fretboard frenzy, but Clapton and his producer seem to conspicuously bury his guitar in the mix. I see Clapton regularly in concert. I have all his albums (solo and with his major groupings) except for Pilgrim, Reptile and now this one. I had Pilgrim and Reptile, but, as with this one, they have all been sold to the local used record outlet. I listened to this repeatedly with headphones hoping it would catch on with me, but it wouldn't. There is simply nothing to this album. Some may say it is just laid back and you gotta let it sink in. I honestly don't mind easy-listening Clapton given my fondness for Backless or Journeyman. I enjoy it when Clapton lays back, as he does on albums like those. However, here, he doesn't lay back, but rather he lays down.
B0001RVTXO|5.0|Not one song I don't like on this one, they definitely did a swell job putting it together. I was just happy that Broken Face, Monkey Gone to Heaven, Caribou, and Gigantic were on it. All in all, good to get if you're just getting into them.

B000001ESN|2.0|By all rights, I should like Rush. It's not like I have a total aversion to '70s prog/art rock, being that I enjoy Gentle Giant, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Magma etc. And I also enjoy some of the later prog and prog-metal bands that Rush influenced (Tool, Mars Volta, Spiral Architect, Queensryche).<br /><br />However, the trio of Lifeson, Lee, and Peart have never made an album that I could listen to without simply clicking the \\"off\\" button midway thru.<br /><br />I'll try to illuminate the various reasons without getting too snarky:<br /><br />1. The music, while no doubt technically accomplished on all fronts (especially Neil Peart's drumming) feels sterile, formulaic, and with few compositional risks taken (and when they ARE taken, they're inevitably embarrassing). It almost feels like a combination of the worst possibilities of '70s arena rock (cheesily anthemic choruses, overwrought hooks, boring songwriting) and '70s prog rock (self-indulgent chops, overextended song lengths, goofy pseudointellectual lyrics). Rush tries to appeal to a middle ground between experimentation and accessibility; nothing wrong with that, but their music fails at both.<br /><br />2. Neal Peart's lyrics are often embarrassingly overwrought and pretentious, often reading like they were written by an acne-afflicted teen whose access to literature is limited to a copy of Atlas Shrugged and a handful of bad fantasy/sci-fi novels.<br /><br />3. Geddy Lee... ack. I've heard him described as a \\"squirrel on helium.\\" As accurate as this is, I'd have to say that's being somewhat charitable. No, imagine a squirrel on helium with its tender bits in a clamp while being chased by a cat. Lee's terrible voice only serves to further emphasize the aforementioned geeky lyrics.<br /><br />4. The synths, when applied, almost always end up sounding dated and artificial. While not as bad as, say, Yes or ELP, they're annoying enough to be noticeable, especially on their '80s work.<br /><br />5. As a sidenote, judging by Mr. Peart's biographies he appears to be an insufferably humorless and egotistical individual.<br /><br />Don't even get me started with the recent Feedback EP--their own music is bad enough without trying to mess up classics by The Who, Buffalo Springfield, et al.<br /><br />For a real art/prog fix, I'd advise you to pick up Gentle Giant's Octopus or any of King Crimson's Mk IV albums (Red, Larks' Tongues, Starless & Bible Black) and give Rush a pass.s to be an insufferably humorless and egotistical individual.

B0009MWAPW|5.0|Leave it to soon-to-be folk legend Sufjan Stevens to proclaim that he will master an album about each and every state. Here, in Come on Feel the Illinoise, Sufjan takes his second small step in the project he has so aptly dubbed, \\"The 50 States\\". While his other state-based classic, Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lakes State may have set the standard for contemporary folk music, \\"Illinois\\" by far exceeds it. <br /> One thing that makes this record so delectable is Sufjan's pure knowledge of everything he is singing about. Stevens uses pure knowledge and research of the areas he visits to write epic masterpieces. Some songs concern minor events in the state's history that have occurred 200 years ago, and others portray folk legends like the son of Jor-El, the man of steel, Superman. No matter what the track may concern, Sufjan makes it his priority to get the word out there on this great place, this state of Illinois. <br /> Illinois contains 22 tracks of varying length, some as long as over seven minutes, and some as brief as six seconds. The only things that are possibly longer than some of his tracks are the titles of them. The second track's title makes Fiona Apple's album titles look abbreviated. In \\"The Black Hawk War, Or, How To Demolish An Entire Civilization And Still Feel Good About Yourself In The Morning, Or, We Apologize For The Inconvenience But You're Gonna Have To Leave Now, Or, 'I Have Fought The Big Knives And Will Continue To Fight...\\" Sufjan shows his versatility by reeling of a beautiful instrumental combining more instruments than one could count, most of which are played by Stevens himself. <br /> But this album is no gimmick. The song titles are just a small part of the album's very concept. One of the better tracks on the album entitled \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\", features chilling lyrics about the infamous serial killer of the same name. <br /> <br />He dressed up like a clown for them  <br />With his face paint white and red  <br />And on his best behavior  <br />In a dark room on the bed he kissed them all  <br />He'd kill ten thousand people  <br />With a sleight of his hand  <br />Running far, running fast to the dead <br /> <br /> This is one of Stevens' only songs to demonstrate this cathartic, almost painful tone. The song is as emotionally poignant as it is stellar. <br /> Other standout tracks include \\"Decatur, Or, Round Of Applause For Your Stepmother,\\" \\"Chicago,\\" and \\"The Seer's Tower\\". Each song on this album displays a different tone and a different theme. Not following the basic concept album format, Stevens' does his part to create his own definition of \\"concept album\\". It was hard to find anything that really didn't stand out upon first listen. Everything is different, yet so unique. The shorter tracks serve more as segues between longer ballads than they do stand-alone songs. The longer titles are all instant hits; a bad one cannot be spotted in the bunch. <br /> This album really can satisfy even the most inexperienced listener. Even if you aren't a fan of folk music, it will be hard not to fall in love with Illinois. And if you are a fan of Sufjan's, his music, or just the state of Illinois in itself, this album is a must have.  <br /> <br />D. Walker
B000002KH3|4.0|I'm not going to review this, there are plenty of good ones here and theres no arguing this has become a rock classic. What I just want to clear something up that I think has been unjustly credited to Mr. Eddie Van Halen. He did not invent the finger tapping style that everyone loves so much and has copied or incorporated into their sound ever since. That goes to Mr. Ace Frehley of Kiss...I kid you not. You see, Van Halen being the guitar wiz that he was cought the ear of Gene Simmons before anybody really knew who Van Halen was and got them recognized. Along the road to success Eddie had went to see Kiss in concert and in particular what Ace did on guitar and saw him doing this finger tapping. He then began to experiment with it and used it as part of his style. This has been stated by both Eddie and Ace as the truth. Ace doesn't get credit for this because he didn't use it excessively so no one really caught on to what it was. I'm not trying to take away the fact that Eddie was and is a really good guitarist, I just wanted to say that he get's credit for something he shouldn't.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Este DVD es simplemente excelente a pesar que algunos critican la inclusin de nuevas escenas. Sin embargo, el DVD incluye ambas filmaciones -la original y la re-editada con nuevas escenas-, por lo tanto, esas crticas no tienen lugar. <br /> <br />Adems, ambas filmaciones son realmente extraordinarias, dado que estn basadas en los mismos tracks. El setlist es bastante bueno, aunque se podran haber elegido otros tracks. <br /> <br />Cabe destacar la interpretacin de Echoes y Carefull With That Axe, Eugene; simplemente geniales. <br /> <br />Definitivamente, esta genialidad debe estar dentro de la coleccin de cualquier fantico de Pink Floyd.
B000001DTM|5.0|- If you're looking for U2 at their most musical, moving, personal, and creative, get this album. <br />- If you're looking for an album which sounds like no other before or since then, but which is still stunningly beautiful (i.e. the experimentation serves the songwriting, rather than drowning it out), get this album. <br />- If you're looking for the album which re-defined pop in the early 1990s, get this album. <br />- ...and if you're looking for the ultimate soundtrack to your life, look no further! <br /> <br />Achtung Baby does something very rare for the world of pop/rock.  It always gets everything just right.  Thematically, musically, even in the order of the songs, this album is as close to perfect as you can hope to get. <br /> <br />It is a powerful yet incredibly delicate record.  There's a sense of fragility in the music, which doesn't come across in U2's recent work, and in my opinion, that gives the music incredible power.  This is U2 being vulnerable, intense, and driven. <br /> <br />The themes in this album are tinged with darkness without being crushing or overly theatrical.  The songwriting is so honest, so raw, that you find yourself immediately sucked into the world of a fairly straight-laced individual getting dangerously tempted by the decadent night-life around him.  Some songs are simply heart-rending, including the unavoidable \\"One\\".  What's great about this album is that each of the 12 tracks is as good as \\"One\\".  Whether upbeat (\\"Light My Way\\", \\"Zoo Station\\", \\"Mysterious Ways\\") or slow (\\"Trying to Throw Your Arms Around the World\\", \\"Love is Blindness\\"), each song is a perfectly balanced gem, which fits in with all the others.  \\"Zoo Station\\" is the perfect opener, in your face, unrelenting and longing, and every song takes the album further in its beautiful arc until the sad and lonely elegy of \\"Love is Blindness\\".   <br /> <br />Musically, the album is entirely coherent.  Certain chord progressions are subtly echoed in various songs (\\"Light My Way\\", \\"Wild Horses\\") without sounding repetitive.  Bono's voice is (in my opinion) at its best here - he's descended a bit from the \\"I'm a gospel singer\\" inflated bombast of the 1980s (think \\"Rattle and Hum\\"), but he hadn't yet slid into the \\"I'M BEING EMOTIONAL\\" mode of U2's last two albums since 2000.  His voice soars effortlessly when it needs to, whispers beautifully at just the right spots, and when he shouts out, the world erupts (or should erupt) in goosebumps.  And Edge's guitar work is wonderfully layered and colorful, always perfectly spot on, and matches Bono's voice perfectly at every turn. <br /> <br />I acquired this CD in 1992, and although I have occasionally OD'd on it a bit (say if I've listened to it for a year straight), every time I go back to it I'm astounded by how good it is.  Even today, it spends an inordinate amount of time in my CD player... <br /> <br />This record is intelligent, emotional, but it isn't just that.  What's also fantastic about it is that the songs themselves absolutely ROCK.  Each one on the album could be a single, they're all that good. <br /> <br />Whether you like U2 for their pop number ones, for their musical depth, or their views of the world, Achtung Baby won't disappoint you. <br />
0446677450|2.0|I like this book to a certain extent. This book was interesting because it gets many accurate points across. It is a fact that many parents do not teach their children the important facts about the priviledge having money, saving money, and maintaining it in order to become successful. Being rich does not last long if you do not know how to handle your money. However, the book started to sound \\"unreal\\" to me because it started to sound like a infomercial with a cover. This book made becoming rich and gaining control over my financial future to easy and too good to be true!!!
B0006IIPIK|3.0|I love the special features on this DVD. It tells the story of a young filmmaker named Kerry Conran who wanted to make a film based on some of the old comic-style pulp fiction that kids grew up with in the 1930's and early 40's. Someone gave me some of those books when I was a kid, and they looked just like Conran's art. Francis Ford Coppola is quoted as having said that one day, the next Mozart would come along and produce a film on his computer in Ohio, or something to that effect. Well, the day has arrived. Conran literally started this film on his computer, with composite photos and artwork done by his brother. They kept writing and piecing together a rough reel to take around to the different studios. The story of their odyssey is amazing, but they finally found people that were interested in helping them; which shows that, if you believe in something that is good and persevere - you'll eventually get there.<br /><br />Almost everything in the film is CGI - which means it was created on a computer - and has a soft, charcoal drawing effect reminiscent of the old 1930's pulp fiction. The few things that are real include the actors, of course: Jude Law as Sky Captain, the fellow everyone calls on when freedom and safety are threatened; Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins, the reporter who's in love with him; and Angelina Jolie as Frankie, an old flame and commander of a British \\"sky station.\\" While the acting is acceptable, you can't expect great performances when everything is blue- and green-screen, and the actors are having to imagine everything in their heads. As wonderful as the film looks, this is no way to make a film.<br /><br />Which brings us to story: it's thin, predictable, and not cliffhanging like the stories it is trying to imitate. I know some think that's the way pulp novels from back then were: maybe so; but that's no excuse - if you're going to make a film for today's audience, you need solid plot and strong dialog, and \\"style\\" is no excuse for sacrificing both. There are other films based on popular material from the same period (the Indiana Jones series being the most notable), and they don't sacrifice these elements; so why should Sky Captain?<br /><br />Granted the \\"look\\" is fun. There was a lot of naivet&eacute; in the 30's about the technical advances of the future, which the Buck Rogers novels and comic books reveal. The \\"streamlined\\" look of planes, trains and automobiles from this period is fascinating, including the industrial design work of Bel Geddes and others. I loved seeing all of that come to life. But this is a movie, not just a walk down memory lane, and we were there to see good drama as well as exciting visuals, and the drama just wasn't there.<br /><br />I think Kerry Conran and his associates had a lot of guts, and I'm glad they made their foray into filmmaking. They proved what could be done in the area of special effects by someone with a computer and a lot of imagination, vision and drive. But they also proved what shouldn't be done: an entire movie built around a look rather than a story. If you don't agree with me on this, go back and watch it again, now that the novelty of the artwork has worn off, and see if it holds your attention the way Twelve O'clock High or other well-written scripts from that period do. The story has to be there.<br /><br />Also, it's not just the script: after a while, the artwork itself gets old. You get tired of looking at too much stylized art, and eventually long for reality. Cinema is a wonderful medium for stylization; but it is primarily a realistic medium, and we want to see that. In cinema, you've got to have at least one foot in reality so that people can believe in and enter your world. Because Sky Captain had most toes dangling in the world of stylized fantasy, with a very thin script to boot, it was really hard to enter that world.<br /><br />At any rate: good effort Kerry Conran and company. I look forward to your next foray. I hope we don't have to wait too long.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith
0060578793|5.0|I've only had this book for a few days, and I'm very impressed with the depth of coverage this book goes into.  It does a great job of covering all the important topics of survival, starting with the basics.  It has a nice set of field guides for edible plants in various regions as well as poisonous.  It covers trapping and hunting game, and a whole section on knots.  Grant it, depending on your level of know how, it may still behoove you to get more in-depth book on some of certain topics.  Still this book of course doesn't replace in-depth research a person needs to do for the specific region they plan to hike or hunt or whatever they do. It makes a great reference book!
B00001OH80|2.0|Bowie hits his first slump on this album. 'Blue Jean' , along with a couple of other tracks are good pop songs, but it's just padded out with too much filler. Even its high points don't match Let's Dance's, but on the plus side (or should that be down side?), this album is at least a bit longer. You have to accept that Bowie is no longer the avant garde enigma he once was, and just try to enjoy what's left. Which isn't much. 'Tumble and Twirl' is given a brisk, funky backing, and it's good fun, too.  <br /> <br />Yet half the album is made up of, at times embarrassing, filler. I especially don't want to hear Bowie singing about 'Old Rudy' in a cod-Jamaican accent ('Don't Look Down'), and the inclusion of a Beach Boys cover is the sound of a man without ideas, trying to get by as a crooner. I'd pick this up on Marketplace if you see it for a couple of quid.

B00005JLH3|3.0|I had always mistakenly assumed that college marching bands were much like high school marching bands. In other words, in college you marched because you had to, not because you wanted to. I also thought that the big deal about marching was learning the moves, and that playing was something the band members already knew how to do. This movie corrected me with respect to both these points and many more. I came to realize that for some bands there are competitions as serious as those between sports teams, though I should point out that to the best of my knowledge there is no BET Southern Classic.<br /><br />Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is an incredibly good drummer on a scholarship to fictional Atlanta A&T University. As fast as someone can play a piece Devon not only picks it up, he plays it. However, Devon has the problem of youth; he is cocky and self-centered and frequently outruns the ability of the band to keep up. His actions do little to put him in good stead with the old-school leader of the band, Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones), and the senior section leader of the drumline, Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts).<br /><br />The plot throws some additional spice into the story. Dr. Lee's job is on the line because his band is so old school that Dr. Lee's band is playing \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\" to a yawning crowd while the opposing band plays hip-hop with sexily-dressed coeds swinging in time to the crowd's pleasure. Devon and Sean Taylor have their own little spats partially because Devon is very good and partially because of Devon's lack of discipline. Of course there is the obligatory love interest for Devon, Laila (Zoe Saldana), who cares for Devon very much, but is exasperated at his (ever hear this before?) lack of discipline and immaturity. Devon also has a secret, which I leave for the viewer to discover.<br /><br />While I was bored from time to time as the movie progressed, the payoff is the scenes involving the bands, particularly the final scenes in the movie. While the ending is somewhat clich&eacute;, I remained glued to the television screen for every single minute, with only an occasional pause to review a particular detail. Sure, the acting is a bit weak. Sure, the movie uses a rehashed plot. But, as the credits rolled and the ending arrived I knew I was going to watch this movie again.vie.

B00063MBU8|1.0|I am going to break my radio! God, that has to be the absolute worst song ever EVER cut. It makes Ashlee Simpson look like Paul McCartney. It is whiny, cheesy, annoying, and doesn't make me feel one bit bad for the guy singing the song at all. So the girl broke up with you... BOO FREAKIN' HOO!!! She should have, you schmuck. Cutting songs like \\"Untitled\\" is a one way ticket to singleville. Grow some balls and make a real heartwrenching and meaningful breakup song.
0380820846|3.0|it took them so long to send me the book i thought i was not going to get it, just like once before and i had already gone to the book store and had them order it (hastings). i got both the old book and the new one from the book store on the same day.  i had waited 21/2 weeks before i went to the book store to order and i got both just last week.  considering i paid as much for the shipping cost as i did for the book for this lady and i think i should have gotten the book within a week
0312935080|5.0|We have been catching up on this interesting author's mystery thriller booklist, about half of which comprise LAPD homicide cop Harry Bosch novels.  Connelly has a knack for writing suspenseful tales which usually take quite a few turns before being resolved.  Much of the tension arises from Bosch's intellectual yet irascible and persistent pursuit of the real perpetrator - Harry is tough to satisfy as he discards one great looking suspect after another!<br /><br />\\"Blonde\\" follows a similar pattern, although the hunt for a murderer is preceded by a court case as suspenseful as the mystery.  Bosch is on trial in a civil suit for excessive force (in the extreme!) for the fatal shooting of a serial murderer dubbed the \\"Dollmaker\\" from the killer's habit of applying makeup to the dead bodies of his female victims.  The attorney for the dead man's wife is the stunning Honey Chandler, who has made a reputation for getting cops who went too far.  Things look bad for Bosch when another killing occurs during the trial, seemingly the work of the Dollmaker.  Obviously this development casts doubt on the guilt of the man Bosch shot, adding fuel to the fire already burning since Bosch shot the naked guy while he was reaching under a pillow for a toupee, not a gun!  In the end, suspicion is cast upon fellow cops, consultants working the case, and various other hangers-on.  Does Bosch get his man and be found innocent?<br /><br />Connelly is an accomplished writer who has again crafted an entertaining mystery.  He adds to the interest of the book by revealing a getting-very-serious romance between Harry and girlfriend Sylvia to temper the pace and action for the main story as well as expose some of Bosch's background and \\"softer\\" side.  All in all, \\"Blonde\\" is a great addition to this author's bibliography, and makes a very enjoyable read!
B000286RZM|3.0|I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy this album, but there is a such a persistence of tone that I got listless before the CD finished.  I would say this album is great for people for who like to be thoroughly depressed.  Sounds a little like Matthew Good Band, and throw in some Sebadoh.   <br />
B000AADYRQ|3.0|Decent follow up and definitely not a dissappointment. However, not their best...It should appeal to new fans and OCers as it is a very accessible album. Too polished and expected in my opinion but I still recommend it to all DCFC fans. Gibbards songwriting is exactly what you've come to appreciate from him, which is a good thing. I'd like to see them stretch themselves a bit as any of the songs on this album would easily fit within Transatlanticism.
0446613444|5.0|In \\"The Black Ice,\\" Michael Connelly delivers another spellbinding mystery initially set in the underbelly of Los Angeles. Connelly owns this turf as no mystery writer has since Raymond Chandler: the Hollywood Hills, hugged by houses perched precariously on stilts; the once-respectable, now seedy motels; the dirty streets; the hierarchy of bars, from bleak to bleaker to bleakest; and the empty, soul-less creatures who need one more shot to get through another day.  This is the Los Angeles where Hieronymous (Harry) Bosch tries to piece together a puzzling series of murders, which start as separate crimes but are soon seen to be interrelated.<br /><br />No \\"Joe Friday\\" LAPD booster, Bosch works his cases alone, often contending with the infighting within the LAPD and the rivalry between the LAPD and other agencies.  The bureaucracy itself can be mindboggling.  Bosch is initially assigned to one of these  cases simply to improve his division's \\"cleared\\" statistics.  As Bosch walks through Parker Center (LAPD headquarters), he is acutely aware of the jealously-guarded fiefdoms invisibly dividing each floor.  And his initial meeting with a DEA agent, where each man is holding back information, sadly rings true.<br /><br />The cases themselves, starting with the suicide of a fellow officer and spreading to the deaths of drug dealers and more, take Bosch from Los Angeles to the sister cities of Calexico and Mexicali.  Connelly has clearly done his research, and the descriptions of those cities and the bull-fighting spectacles south of the border are first rate.  Despite being both helped and hampered by the Mexican police, Bosch painstakingly solves the cases.  The last plot twist was a complete surprise to me.<br /><br />This is the second Harry Bosch mystery I've read (I'm reading them in order) and I believe it is even better than Michael Connelly's first, Edgar-winning effort, \\"The Black Echo.\\"  I look forward to reading more works by this engaging author.
B00026WU82|5.0|there's good reason why dylan is heralded so much,because he damn well deserves it.this,arguably his best is perfect in every way.sure he doesn't have the greatest voice but somehow it works.but who can deny the prowess of this mans words and music? this album is so important and quite possibly the greatest album of all-time because of it's extreme level of influence that continues to this day.we need more important work like this,especially in this day and age where mediocrity seems to be king.i wish i had experienced the time period of this albums release when it seemed that materialism wasn't so important.this should be required listening for everyone that they should make it a law,maybe than the world would be a better place.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|I've never been a big fan of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels, so I went into this movie with not very high expectation.  Considering the whithering criticism the film received I didn't think that would be the wrong idea.  However, this move turned out to be quite good and really a lot of fun.  Granted, this film is not high art, but then neither are Cussler's novels.  Moreover, since when does a movie have to be high art in order to be good?  Matthew McConaughey is great as the adventurous Dirk Pitt, Steve Zahn is hilarious as the comic relief, and Penlope Cruz holds her own with a bunch butt-kicking guys.  The story does stretch the imagination, but that's also part of the fun.  For anyone looking for a great time and fun movie, Sahara is the choice.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|What it boils down to is the music.  And it is here that the movie version of the incredible stage play fails.  Emmy Rossum is the one bright spot.  She alone makes you glad you're listening.  If they can dub Minnie Driver - why in the world did they not dub the two male leads.  I *KNOW* that there have to be better singers' voices that could have been used.  Josh Groban for instance.   <br /> <br />I will probably rewatch it in the future, but I will want to play the original cast recording as I mute the television.  Otherwise, it was beautiful and wonderful to have another chance to *see* my favorite stage play, instead of only in my mind's eye.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This movie is very emotional, but reminds us that remembering the imagination and curiousity of our youth is important.  Even though it is not a exact story of Peter pan, it's a great movie to watch and every adult and child of any age should watch it.
0064409422|5.0|I had read this book as a child but had forgotten reading it.  I read this now as a 38yo and I loved it.  All the wonderful memories of curling up with this book came flooding back.  I highly reccomend reading this book.  I have learned through my paster at church that the characters in this book portray Jesus, Satan and sinners.  Once I finished reading this I fully understood about the characters.
B00005N919|4.0|BASIC INSTINCT is notorious for the scene, now imprinted into our cultural consciousness, where Sharon Stone uncrosses her legs sans panties, but it is just as impressive as a groundbreaking thriller in which a bisexual author (Stone) seduces the cop (Michael Douglas) sent to investigate a series of spectacular murders which track the plots of her books.<br /><br />A strong supporting performance by Jeanne Tripplehorn as a police psychologist with more than a few skeletons in her own closet rounds out the major players. Although Stone and Tripplehorn never meet face to face on camera it is the angry sexual dynamics between them that lend power and creedence to this film.<br /><br />A highly controversial film upon its release, it had both the gay community and the self-appointed keepers of the public morals up in arms about its subject matter, its characterizations, and its graphic nature. An incredibly well-crafted psychosexual thriller, it entices the viewer even now, almost fifteen years after its initial release.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I watched this movie the other night on cable t.v. and loged on to Amazon to purchase the DVD. Out of curiosity I started reading the reviews. The reviews are either very good or very bad. I feel that the people who rated it very low and say it is mundane, boring, and discriminatory just don't get the film. This is one of the few films that portrays real life. It is closer to real life than most films. This movie is not for someone who wants excitement and action, but rather is for someone who can look deep inside to ones own sole and connect.  <br /> <br />There are some reviewers her who say that they should have learned the language and not complain about the food. That is ridiculous. If you were going to Japan for a 3 day stay, would you actually take a year or more to learn the language? NOT!! And about them complaining about cooking their own food, excuse me, but I would complain to. One reviewer here said that this film portrays stupidity on the part of the Japanese culture. I disagree. I think that the American actors are the ones portrayed as stupid here.  <br /> <br />This film is not for those who want just a surface film about unrealistic lives. This film is for someone who can dream, who can fantasize, who can look beyond normal life.
B00005JODA|5.0|The title 'The Constant Gardener' has multiple meanings for this film, but first it refers to the obvious, the character of Justin Quayle, a middle-tier member of the British diplomatic corps in Africa, who is constantly trying to cultivate a proper garden, be it in London or in Africa.  Into his routine civil service existence, Tessa arrives, full of ideas, passion for justice, and more than a few secrets.  Of course, the diplomatic corps powers also have their secrets, and it is in the clash of secrets that Tessa ends up being murdered, and Justin's life turns from one of routine if not wholehearted loyalty to the service into an extraordinary, passionate and heart-felt loyalty to the memory of his wife.<br /><br />This film is remarkable in several ways, not the least because of the cinematography.  More than half the film is set in Africa, both Kenya and the Sudan.  Here is life in all its contradictions - abject poverty and stunning beauty, illness and disease amidst the overpopulation; life among the dying, and death among the living.  One thing the viewer will notice is that all of the scenes in Africa are shown in vivid, powerful colours.  The scenes in London and on the European continent are faded and gray; despite the fact that the European scenes are invariably set in wealthy settings (private clubs, opulent halls, expensive buildings, etc.), they lack the colour and life of the African scenes - even the Kenyan shanty town and the Sudanese refugee camp seem to contain more life than the major cities of the Western world.  This is surely no accident, but rather a device the director used to intensify the contradictions.<br /><br />There are several plots that lead into one another - what was Tessa really up to?  Who was involved, and to what degree?  There are a few subplots that fall short, but on the whole, the film hangs together well in a narrative sense.  Tessa's murder is an early event, and much of the film is done in flash-back or memory sequences, until the two come together in time frame and the mystery begins to reach some clarity.<br /><br />This film is directed by Fernando Meirelles, who was nominated for an Oscar for his first film, the Brazilian 'City of God'.  His is certainly a name to watch.  In this film he directs<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes ('The English Patient', a film that bears many similarities here) and Rachel Weisz ('The Mummy'), together with a good collection of British and African actors.  The extras casting for Africa was extremely well done, and the nice touches such as the AIDS street-theatre performance in the Kenyan slum were inspired.<br /><br />The film has  a majestic, broad and sweeping feel to it.  One is treated to a visual banquet of images, colourful deserts and lakes, wildlife and plant life, and the people of the lands of Africa, all truly remarkable.  The music is sometimes subtle and sometimes dramatic - much is inspired by native sounds of Africa.<br /><br />The film is engrossing and interesting, causing many feelings to grow in the garden of viewing.uences, until the two come together in time frame and the mystery begins to reach some clarity.   <br /> <br />This film is directed by Fernando Meirelles, who was nominated for an Oscar for his first film, the Brazilian 'City of God'.

B00008972S|5.0|Personally, I don't care if the American Film Institute ranks Singin' in the Rain way above West Side Story. I don't care that West Side Story is not even ON the Time Magazine Top 100 film list. This is the best movie musical ever made--in my opinion, FAR superior to Singin' in the Rain which has some great stuff but is not consistently as inventive, creative, imaginative, and energetic as West Side Story. Let's take a look at the credentials, shall we?<br /><br />1. The best dancing of any movie musical ever made. Choreographer Jerome Robbins was an extremely intense, non-stop taskmaster who got the best out of his performers by doing take after take until every single minute was perfect. And it shows. When you watch the dancing in \\"Cool\\", for example, your jaw drops open. Nothing in ANY other musical, before or since, ever came or comes close. The creativity on display in all the dance sequences, from beginning to end, is way beyond brilliant. It is pure genius. Astounding.<br /><br />2. The music is incredible. Leonard Bernstein, the composer, was one of the most powerful intellects in the history of American music. He wrote classical music, jazz, popular music, and was a phenomenal conductor. Listen to the absolutely unconventional but tremendously compelling music of the songs, as well as the rumble and the dance at the gym. Again, there is NOTHING like this in any other musical ever. Ever.<br /><br />3. The lyrics are perfect. The lyricist, Stephen Sondheim, was the glove to Bernstein's hand--a perfect fit. The emotional power of the songs is such that it thrills and touches the viewer/listener like nothing else in the history of American musicals. Sondheim went on to well deserved fame and fortune. Here he was in his early days and already a master at his craft. Fantastic.<br /><br />4. The performers are really well cast. The two \\"E\\"s--energy and emotion--are needed for this show, and they are here in abundance. The soul of the work is, deservedly, Rita Moreno, who capped an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress, and it's easy to see why.<br /><br />5. The story is timeless and is very intelligently drafted from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet by screenwriter Ernest Lehman. He did a terrific job of transitioning the theme of love and conflicting groups to New York City, circa the 1950s, and the inclusion of racial prejudice as a powerful plot device is one of the driving forces that makes the film so amazing. This is the reason, among others, that Rita Moreno is the soul of West Side Story. A Latina herself, she represents the heart of an emerging America that a very large portion of the population could not accept--the influx of those from outside the country. Making this a cornerstone of the story was a stroke of genius.<br /><br />You can't get any better than this. This is NOT a five star film. It's a TEN star film. Buy it, see it, and see it again. THIS is what a musical is meant to do. THIS is cinema.<br /><br />The best there is.ita Moreno, who capped an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress, and it's easy to see why.  <br /> <br />5.

B000AU9UYM|4.0|Finally, a writer/director has finally given the avenger of the night his due. I'd like to give it 4 1/2 stars but it's not possible. This was a nicely done action/comicbook drama that should have been done in 1989. TIM BURTON's first 2 BATMAN films were decent but it didn't do the main character justice, the other movies  went downhill, Batman and Robin being the worst! CHRISTOPHER NOLAN (director of memento,Blade)has finally done his homework and came up with a movie that actually is a close persona of the Batman after his re-vamp in the late 80's.<br /><br />Christian Bale does an excellent job potraying Bruce Wayne, you can feel his pain and obsession with avenging his parents. The WAYNE PERSONA is important because he is the driving force why the Caped crusader is the best at what he does. The movie does a very good potrayal of how he came to be, where he gets his gadgets and stuff. Liamm Neeson is great and the scarecrow was well, scary.<br /><br />The only complaint I have would be the costume design. It still looks bulky and the cape is a mistake. If you really want to see what Batman is suppose to look like, check out the fan film, BATMAN:DEAD END. The mask and the eyes are perfect. The Batman is believable as a terrifying winged creature of the night.<br /><br />Overall the movie itself was great. Set designs were in infallible, the new Batmobile was unstoppable and Morgan Freeman was Lucius Fox. Ras al Ghul is my favorite villain. I just hope Nolan does a good Joker  like in the fan film mentioned above.<br /><br />I want the original Bat-suit!!<br /><br />I'm buying the DVD!
1400032717|5.0|Beautifully written, heartbreaking but lovely, and exquisitely felt, this book resonated with me for days after I read it.  I have passed it on to several friends, all of whom felt the same way about it.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I fell in love with Josh Groban's voice the first time I heard him in a performance on PBS and have been hooked ever since.  My 16 year old daughter is now a HUGE fan also.  When I have Groban in the cd player there's no argument over what we're listening to, just which track it happens to be on.  My favorite song on this album is \\"When You Say You Love Me\\".  He brings so much emotion to the piece and you can't help but be drawn in by the beauty of the lyrics.      If you're a fan of Groban, this is a wonderful addition to your collection.  I like to listen to it in the car with the windows down and the volume up.  It's too beautiful not to share with everyone around!
B000024D4R|5.0|I first bought \\"Animals\\" on 8 track when it was first released and used to lay in bed at night with my headphones on and fall asleep listening to it. It is still one of my all time favorite albums.  <br /> <br /> <br />The 8 track version had a \\"filler\\" guitar solo on \\"Pigs On The Wing\\" that was cut out on the LP and CD versions.  <br /> <br />The concept behind \\"Animals\\" seems even more relevant and appropriate today than it did then. It's timeless.
6305657947|4.0|I have watched this film several times, and finally decided to purchase it.  I think the chemistry is sizzling and the charcters are so much fun to watch.  The scipt keeps you guessing until the end!!
0671891634|4.0|If you're just starting out in stocks and investing.  This is a good book.  It tells you to know your stocks, to do your homework when you buy stocks and how to pick good stocks.  It gives you some good places to start and it also gives you some history on Peter Lynch.   <br />The experienced investor will probably know most of the things in this book.  There are no \\"secret techniques\\" or anything in this book.  Just plain common sense.
B00005ASHM|5.0|A number of years ago a family friend gave me this album on vinyl for Christmas and I fell in love with it. I would listen to it over and over again until it was truly worn. It just left me in awe because the melody was so accessible and the lyrics were sophisticated. It is pop music at its most brilliant.  The best way to describe this album and Brian Wilson is that \\"Pet Sounds\\" was able to intelligently describe and communicate maturing adolescent emotions. The music just glows and while it may not be the greatest album of all times it is certainly one of the finest works. It starts out with \\"Wouldn't Be Nice\\" and gives this faint impression of a poppy album and then Wilson proceeds to take you for this ride where all you can do is smile in absolute enjoyment. But it isn't just bliss he delves into regret and a sense of bewilderment. \\"God Only Knows\\" always breaks my heart in two. I immediately think of a boy I was in love with when I was seventeen. Last Christmas I gave it to my sister and she too was immediately mad about this album as well. This album creates instant nostalgia.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|I've always been a big Death Cab for Cutie fan, but this CD just dissapoints me a little. My favorites are \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\", \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\", and \\"Crooked Teeth.\\"<br /><br />1 (4:15 Marching Bands of Manhattan) This song is an excellent CD opener and is one of my favorites on the CD. The organ at the beginning is intriging. I am a sucker for organs. The guitar chords are very simple. It has a bit of a Postal Service in it.<br /><br />2 (3:51 Soul Meets Body) Soul Meets Body feels like a repeat of The Sound of Settling. It has that same pop flavor. It's being played on MTV. It's going to be their best selling track, but it is very mainstream.<br /><br />3 (3:14 Summer Skin) It opens with a solitary piano, followed by the drums and a soft guitar. The lyrics are not quite impressive. I feel like Gibbard is trying too hard to rhyme. The song is a ballad and not very exciting because the CD is full of ballads.<br /><br />4 (5:09 Different Names for the Same Thing) Again, opening with a solitary piano that plays throughout with the same tune. This song is another boring song with Gibbard's voice a little muffled. I think some ballads are fine, but the overdose on this CD makes it boring.<br /><br />5 (3:09 I Will Follow You Into the Dark) This song's beginning reminds me of Bright Eyes. It starts with a guitar. The lyrics are possibly the best on the CD. It has a bit of an underground, unpolished feel which I absolutely love. The song gives me a sense of warmth and I love it, but it is another slow paced song.<br /><br />6 (3:39 Your Heart is an Empty Room) Another pop song. This contains so-so lyrics and isn't very intersting. It feels a little like Soul Meets Body. It is a nice change from Ballads.<br /><br />7 (3:12 Someday You Will Be Loved) The song starts with a fuzzy guitar which is joined with a piano playing simple notes and Gibbard's voice. The song picks up tempo, but is still essentially a ballad. You can tell especially by the lyrics. This song is probably one of the best on the CD.<br /><br />8 (3:24 Crooked Teeth) This song makes me so content because it reminds me a lot of Something About Airplanes especially at the beginning. I love the lyrics and the tempo. Gibbard's voice is authentic and you can hear a bit of Chris Walla. It isn't as materilized as the other songs. It seems like it could be made at Barsuk.<br /><br />9 (6:21 What Sarah Said) This song opens with a solitary piano which is eventually joined by soft drums. It is quite pleasant to listen to, but gets quite boring. It is, of couse, another ballad. The song's lyrics are better than some of the others.<br /><br />10 (4:31 Brothers on a Hotel Bed) This is my least favorite on the CD. The lyrics are the worst Death Cab for Cutie lyrics I've ever heard.The sad part is this is the only song by Death Cab for Cutie that hasn't been written, at least in part, by Ben Gibbard. It starts with a mellow piano. I feel like I'm having deja vu. It's all the same. This song isn't originial. The combination of the bad lyrics and the same tune just make this song bad.<br /><br />11 (3:44 Stable Song) This song is also boring. 3:44 of boring. Slow lyrics, slow song. It dissapoints me.<br /><br />Overall, this CD is nothing better than OK. It's filled with the same dull melody and is overloaded with ballads. It's B O R I N G. It pains me that this was made by Death Cab for Cutie. I hope it's just a CD slump. It could be the new major label producers wanting the same thing. I don't know if it would be better at Barsuk, but maybe it wouldn't sound so much of the same.<br /><br />If you're new to Death Cab for Cutie, start with The Photo Album or Transatlanticism. In my opinion, they're the best. Let's just hope that the next CD's are like those.the best on the CD. <br />8 (3:24 Crooked Teeth) This song makes me so content because it reminds me a lot of Something About Airplanes especially at the beginning. I love the lyrics and the tempo. Gibbard's voice is authentic and you can hear a bit of Chris Walla. It isn't as materilized as the other songs. It seems like it could be made at Barsuk. <br />9 (6:21 What Sarah Said) This song opens with a solitary piano which is eventually joined by soft drums. It is quite pleasant to listen to, but gets quite boring. It is, of couse, another ballad. The song's lyrics are better than some of the others. <br />10 (4:31 Brothers on a Hotel Bed) This is my least favorite on the CD.

0553573403|5.0|I: A Game of Thrones<br /><br />II: A Clash of Kings<br /><br />III: A Storm of Swords<br /><br />(IV: A Feast for Crows, due out this fall)<br /><br />(V: A Dance with Dragons, uncertain release date - but it is partially finished)<br /><br />Come ye, come ye, you who drudged through the Wheel of Time, you who were entangled by Belgariad and Malloreon and Elenium, you who were seduced by Thomas Covenant and entrapped by the Dragonbone Chair.<br /><br />I say that this series is better than any of its contemporaries. This is fantasy that plays for keeps. All of the characters are human and round - there are heroes on both the 'good' and the 'bad' sides. When Martin writes from a character's viewoint, you really sympathize with that character while you are in his head. In fact, I think Martin paints the most empathetic characer portraits in ANY fantasy book I have read. You really care about the characters. It is his greatest strength.<br /><br />Of course that makes their deaths so much more significant. This is a gritty and harshly _real_ fantasy that plumbs the depths of treachery, honor and love. No character is immune from the events of the world and many main characters are killed off throughout the books. The world is harsh, but all of its harshness is modeled after the real world. The world of this series is as snug and well-thought-out as any of the others, but as this is one place where nearly every fantasy author gets it right, Martin deserves no special credit.<br /><br />There is hardly any magic in these books, which makes what magic there is much more effective, and scary when it has to be. Like in Tolkien, magic is a thing of which there is much evidence in the past, but which has almost disappeared. In fact it becomes clear that the magic of Martin's world is merely laying dormant. The conflict between human Houses seems to be just giving way to a conflict between two equally scary magical forces. (Both fire and ice are shown as wild, seductive, uncaring, uncontrollable.) While in most fantasy books, some kind of ultimate Good ends up fighting some kind of Evil incarnate, still there is no good and bad in Martin (yet!) except for within the minds of the characters.<br /><br />Oh, and the SCHEMING. The PLOTTING. The politics of this series is twisty and intricate, with seven great houses who each are constantly trying to gain more influence, but never does it turn into the sort of pointless and boring games that Rand bludgeons through in Cairhien or Tear. (Wheel of Time reference.) There is always a point to the plots, they always make sense. Characters ACT, they do not sit around thinking too much. As you read, Martin is excellent at making you care about what's going on. Because of his immense gift for this stuff, you'll actually REMEMBER almost every one of his hundred characters and the machinations that involve them. This is definitely and PRIMARILY a political fantasy.<br /><br />I absolutely love these books. They are very very different from Tolkien and as far as I can see borrow very little from the professor; it reads like a historical fiction for the beginning (a good deal of the world and the plot is based on the English War of the Roses) that is crossed with Tad Williams' creativity and inspiration and Robert Jordan's rigor. (If you are looking for influences, those two authors have given a lot to this work. Martin, however, is no fool and takes from each their best qualities - what made me read them in the first place.) I cannot emphasize enough Martin's gift for characterization and for tale-weaving. The quality of the writing itself is excellent.<br /><br />I am blinded by the excellence of this series. I truly cannot see a fault. Martin is scintillating and totally unpredictable. He worked for ten years as a Hollywood writer and his dialogue is as witty as hell. I have fallen in love with at least three of his characters.<br /><br />Seriously, if you have read these books you will know what I amtalking about. Not since Tolkien have I given up all my reservations about a series simply because I loved it so much.<br /><br />The first three are out in paperback. I say, try and find them as soon as possible, even though the sixth and last book is probably not going to be out for another five years. The books are Wheel of Time length but they fly by. (Maybe because the same amount of stuff happens in one martin book as in.. let's see.. one and a half of the first few jordan books, or two of the later ones.)

B0006J28KU|3.0|Maybe I need to go watch this a couple more times, but after seeing it I just wasn't that impressed.  I'm not saying it is bad, but it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  I was expecting a power crime/mob drama like \\"Casino\\" and that likes of it.  For me, this movie was not it.  I say rent it before you buy it.
B0000648WZ|3.0|I watched this with a friend that I served in the Army with. The movie was excellent for a Hollywood military film. We even laughed during the scene were Rico told the recruiter he wanted to go Infantry and called him a dummy.(Considering that we were both in the infantry) As a veteran I didn't care for the political statement a man who never served in the military tried to push on every one. <br />If you read the original book from Heinlein you would find it an insult to his book. Verhoeven only copied part of the plot and the title.  <br />The director of the movie tried to make it look like the humans really started the war against the bugs. Being you couldn't see how they could possibly travel from planet to planet. The book mentions that the bugs do have their own starships. You also believe the Bugs n the book did start the war. Heinlein mentions in the book that both species wanted the same real estate and in the end it was depending on which species had the right to survive. NOT that what the movie was showing. (Just what to expect from the extreme left running in Hollywood these days.) <br />The thing I hated most (Being that I loved the book) was seeing the soldiers run around looking like Nazi soldiers. Heinlein's book did have a military society but if you look at history the proper name of the Nazi's party was, National Socialistic Deutsch Arbeiter Partei (English, National Socialist German Workers Party) which means the Nazi's were extreme left wingers. If Mr. Verhoeven wanted to base the soldiers on a military society then, Germany before the First World War or the old Confederate Army. <br />The saddest thing about it was why the book was popular amongst the Paratroopers in the Army. The director could have shown the MI troopers being shot out of cannons on the Starships and coming down with parachutes. That was the best part in the book. <br />Another sad thing is it showed the women fighting along side the men and between battles making whoopee. The soldiers in the book didn't have time for that and women had different jobs. If Mr. Verhoeven wanted to show a woman can do as much as a man, then he should have paid attention to the book. It was saying that the female pilots were better than the male pilots. <br />If you never read the book you won't be too disappointed but I would suggest reading the book. <br />My personal opinion is when you take the name and plot of a book then you shouldn't ruin what the writer was trying to show for your own political ideas. (Especially if your ideas are different from those of the writer.) A movie based closer to the book would have been better. They simply took another mans idea and twisted it. This was very unoriginal and an insult to the writer.
B0009I7NOO|5.0|Hi, <br />I am satisfied about the Dual Disc I bought. That's why in Italy I haven't seen this new standard yet and at this good price. The little bad thing is that I waited 1 month in order to get it.
B000002GK1|4.0|This is a very impressive debut from a clearly musically talented band.  They remind me a little of Black Sabbath and yet they do have a slightly different twist to their sound enough to make them sound uniquely themselves.  Track 6 is one example of this as it shows they can be very hard and yet have a melodious side as well.  The guitarist is very good though not quite in the Tony Iommi league as yet but still he plays very interesting chops.  The lead singer has a much better voice than Ozzie though.  I only gave 4 stars because I suppose for an unremastered disc the sound is okay but after 14 years, it really is about time they cleaned up the sound.  Overall, a rather decent disc.
0446677450|5.0|I enjoyed reading \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" because he gives excellent advice for people that want to own their own business someday. This book really motivates me to learn more about how you can change the way you spend your income. Robert T. Kiyosaki has so many inspirational ideas that will make the reader understand his unique economic perspective for a business. Mr.Kiyosaki demonstrate to me that people do not need employers that you can be self-employed. This book is perfect read for a person that desires a better look at their Cash flow. I'm going to buy Cash flow 101 e-game to better understand the concepts of stock business. And when I have children I'm going to teach them about Cash Flow that way I don't make that mistake that many parents make, which is to teach their children nothing about how money makes a business grow. I loved the \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" and I highly recommend people to read it.
B000056N8X|4.0|After the release of what at the time was believed to have been the final 'Highlander' film with \\"Highlander: The Final Dimension\\".  The only way fans of the film series were able to get their Immortal fix was by tuning in to the popular syndicated \\"Highlander\\" TV series starring Adrian Paul as Duncan MacLeod, a cousin of Connor MacLeod's from the films.  The series took the basic mythology of the original film and the sequels that followed, and continued to build a world around the Immortals and their 'Game', where as the prophecy states, \\"In the end, there can be only one.\\"  Then the TV series ended, and led into a less popular spin-off series that lasted one season, \\"Highlander: The Raven\\".  Fans of the franchise were wondering if ever the films and TV series would collide, so we could see both Connor and Duncan together again (the last time the two cousins were together was in the pilot episode for the \\"Highlander\\" TV series).  In 2000, 6 years after the release of \\"Highlander: The Final Dimension\\" fans got exactly what they wished for as \\"Highlander: Endgame\\" was released nationwide to theaters.    \\"Highlander: Endgame\\" picks up sometime after the events of the 3rd film, or some fans choose to believe that it ignores the previous 2 sequels completely, therefore picking up sometime after the original film, \\"Highlander\\".  Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert, who played Connor in all of the 'Highlander' films and in the pilot episode of the TV series) is growing weary of the 'Game', and chooses to take refuge in a monastery set up by the 'Watchers to ensure that there will always be at least 2 Immortals so the 'Prize' may never be claimed.  Now, a new, evil and powerful Immortal has arrived and has raised a team of renegade Immortals who really have no desire to win the 'Prize', but merely to kill.  The leader of the renegade faction of Immortals is a man named Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne), a man that has a vendetta to settle with Connor from their past in Scotland.With this new group of Immortals shaking things up, Connor must try to defeat his old nemesis, but he can't do it alone, so Connor enlists the aid of his cousin, Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul, who played Duncan in the TV series).  Together, these 2 cousins, who are as close as brothers, must try to restore balance to the 'Game', and bring down the most ruthless Immortal to ever live.  However, no matter who wins, \\"In the end, there can be only one.\\"    After this film was released many felt it was the first sequel to ever truly do justice to the groundwork mythology that was laid in the original film.  While others felt that it was just an extended episode of the TV series, or that the film should have just focused either on Connor or Duncan, not on both of them.  Then of course we had those that felt the entire movie was just one big waste of time, and that they should have just let the series die after the 3rd film.  Personally, I enjoyed this movie, and I liked that they linked the TV series and the movies together, it made for a more believable franchise, in which all facets of the franchise were linked in some way to one another.  The acting was well done, the story was good for bridging the gap between the films and the TV series.  The only complaint I have regarding this movie is that they probably waited too long to make the film, because Christopher Lambert just didn't quite look as good as Connor as he had in previous films.  Of course, that happens when an actor is playing a character that is supposed to never age, but the series of films lasts for over 14 years.  But even with that gripe, Christopher still did a great job as Connor, and was still believable in the fight scenes.  I thought this movie was very well done, and served as a nice end to tie up any loose ends from both the films and the TV series.    If you are a fan of the 'Highlander' films or the TV series, then this movie is for you, it will definitely satisfy your nagging need for some closure regarding your favorite Immortals.    \\"Highlander: Endgame\\" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/nudity.

B00025ETIW|3.0|This was kind of an impulse buy for me, based on the two singles they released. I have to say, despite the fact that a few of the tracks grated on my nerves and I couldn't understand what the hell he was singing, it grew on me. The more I listened the more I liked, and (shockingly) found myself singing along. You know, once I figured out the lyrics. This music just sort of amps you up.  <br /> I love music, but I have to admit that I have no idea what it means when people drone on about the style of a band... \\"Emo, mallcore, screamo\\"... Just give it a listen whether it's your particular taste or not. And PLEASE don't be one of those cliche people who choose not to like a band just because they get on MTV and become popular... If you're a true music lover, it shouldn't matter what \\"type\\" of people listen to the music, if you like it, buy it!.... and just try not to care if that preppy chick sitting next to you sees the CD you just bought, turns her pretty little head and goes \\"Oh, My GOD! MCR, I love them!\\"

B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin is my favorite band of all time no doubt. They have a very unique style and i never get bored listening to them. Of course Led Zeppelin IV (aka ZOSO) is thier most famous cd and probably has the most of thier big hits in one album. This CD is a must buy for all you new zeppelin fans out there. With such songs as Black Dog, Stairway to Heaven, and Rock and Roll this CD is definetly a good buy.       <br />      <br />    But if you really are into zeppelin then you might want to pass this one by, why you ask? Well, most zeppelin fans already have these songs either through download or greatest hits CDs. Of course these songs are great but if you have already heard them i suggest buying a new album such as physical graphitti or houses of the holy. Dont get me wrong Led Zeppelin IV is one of the best  albums i have ever had the pleasure of listening too but theres so much more to Zeppelin than that.   Justin11

0812550706|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend of mine. A techie who is into SF. Combination eh? Well it turned out, he made the recommendation which changed my reading habits. Ender's game along with 'Ender's shadow' and 'Speaker for the dead' are the best SF books that I have read after Clarke and Asimov. They are also profound in the thoughts they introduce. Though Ender's Game is straight forward in the sense that it revolves around a set of characters and the large scale effect is only implied. I would recommend it to even to people not into SF, because its written in very simple language and appeals to all. I recommended it to my mother - a rivetted historical fiction fanatic - and she loved it too.
B000002UAX|5.0|This was the first cd I ever purchased, along with my first cd player in the 1980s.  A favorite since I was a child, I leaned more about the history of this work as I got older.  This is both a challenging album to listen to, as well as a appetizing, captivating, and thoroughly enjoyable roller-coaster ride of musical genius. <br /> <br />The Beatles were on their separate ways by now, and this work has the sound and feel of individual tracks sewn together into one whole.  The question is whether or not this is a bad thing.  Lennon and McCartney are each at their arguable pinnacles of creativity, and more than solid contributions are here from Starr and Harrison as well.  If you have great material - regardless of whether it was written together or individually - played by one of the greatest musical combinations in history, how could it be a disappointment? <br /> <br />This is a brilliant work that came from four musicians via separate routes.  The result is an album that has yielded at least several songs on almost everyone's favorites list. <br />

B00005JLEX|2.0|To be honest with you, this show isn't consistantly funny or even smart most of the time...but it does have it's funny moments and they all involve George, Kramer, and especially Newman. But Jerry Seignfeld is one of the worst stand-up comedians I've ever seen! His jokes are so bland and boring e.x. \\"What's the deal with airplane food?\\" I mean come on people!     Julia Louis-Dreyfus isn't funny either. It always seems like she's there either as a straightwoman or to be annoying. Some of my friends and a lot of critics said that this show is hilarious and revolutionary, I on the other hand see neither. I see a hugly overrated show whose main characters aren't even 1/4 funny and the the only ones that are aren't even used properly.     If you want to see a funny show watch \\"The Drew Carey Show\\" it's hilarous. Or, if you want situation comedy see \\"Everybody Loves Raymond.\\" but if you want to watch a show about nothing, and almost nothing good to offer, look no further!
1402555989|5.0|This was the first book I've listened to on tape, and it was an outstanding performance. Some books on tape can be hard to follow but this was quite easy, and the performance by Jeff Woodman brings the novel to amazing and comical and heartbreaking life. I highly recommend any audiobooks with Jeff Woodman as reader because he so naturally gets to the heart of characters and makes a book as entertaining and captivating as a good movie. <br /> <br />While I recommend this book on tape, I also strongly recommend reading the actual text, which features drawings and pictures that can't be expressed in the audio version. A great book to have on your bedstand and for multiple readings. This isn't just a fiction narrative. Through its telling by a young man with Asperger's Syndrome, the book provides insights and views that really make you stop and think about things and see the world in a whole different way. <br /> <br />A fascinating and complex piece of literature in a deceptively compact book.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Like many others who have already reviewed this set, I have been a fan of Star Wars since the beginning. I remember back when we called it plain old Star Wars and not Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. The earliest memory I have is going to the drive-in here in Phoenix, Arizona with my parents and seeing Star Wars. My mom says I had a grin on my face for days. We saw it many times after that. And with each sequel I was there in line waiting in the heat to see them. Star Wars is/was a big part of my childhood and I have watched the original trilogy numerous times over the years. So when it was finally announced that George Lucas was finally allowing his original trilogy to be released on DVD I was ecstatic. Finally I would be able to watch the films on my favorite format and I could sell of my numerous VHS copies. Now I admit I was a little diappointed to find that only the Special Edition versions of the films would be released. I myself prefer the original versions of the films but I somewhat understood why Lucas wanted to add to the films. I like some of the added backgrounds, the improved special effects and the better sound. What I don't appreciate is Lucas messing with scenes that we have grown to love over the years. Scenes that shaped the characters into how we knew them. I think you all know I am referring to the infamous Han and Greedo scene. Also I am not a fan of the added Jabba scene. But I still enjoy the Star Wars films and watch them faithfully. I have since sold off all of my VHS copies of the Star Wars triolgy except for one. That would be the set with the old versions of the film. I will be holding on to that set until George has a change of heart and decides to do the right thing and release the original versions of the films. But until that time I am happy to have them on DVD any way I can get them. They look great, sound great and the bonus disc included in this set has some great documentaries. Lucas really put a lot into this set and for that Iam thankful. There are those out there who like to refer to fans like myself as Star Wars geeks, well I am more than happy to have that title. Because to me Star Wars is a big part of who I am and I would not deny that for anything. May the force be with you....always!!!

B000000W8C|5.0|I don't think there has ever been a band that has elicited so many contrasting emotional responses for me as The Verve (pain and joy, beauty and tragedy, loss and love).  Followers will know the blue collar boys from Wigan viewed their contribution to rock as something that could expand the conscious of what music is.  Singer Richard Ashcroft talked of how the band were creating music as if it were the last time they'd step foot in a recording studio.  These to me are examples and qualities of a mindset that is so sadly lacking in most of todays rather unobtrusive market. <br />   <br />To me \\"A Northern Soul\\" reaches isolated depths of harrowism without ever sounding pretentious.  Guitarist Nick McCabe's psychedelics is like a hard-hitting assault on the senses, and  Ashcroft complements and enchances that with a vocal fervor only matched by Eddie Vedder.  Bassist Simon Jones and drummer Peter Salisbury are often overlooked yet invaluable in their rhythmic positions. <br /> <br />ANS does contain some prettier tracks (On Your Own, Drive You Home), but Ashcroft and McCabe's \\"broken glass\\" relationship helped propel the Verve sound into a whole nother level of loudness and madness.  For my money \\"A Storm In Heaven\\" and ANS are the best 1-2 punch of the '90s.   <br /> <br />

The first thing I thought of as I pressed play on this stellar album was \\"how long would it actually take someone to make 50 albums each as completely unique as the state used as subject matter?\\"  The second thought:  \\"Do you think Alaska and Hawaii will be the last ones on the list/Do you think they'll be bitter?\\" <br /> <br />Somehow the semantical questions evaporated from my brain soon after the album's sonic subtlties truly took hold, yes, that happened on the first track.   <br /> <br />Stevens has been a participant and most likely a beneficiary of the whole freak-folk movement gathering steam through trendy indie circles.  Devendra Barnhart and Joanna Newsom, while offering a spiritual experience in their right, have yet to capture the intimacy of Steven's lyrics or the musical maturity of such songs as \\"John Wayne Gacy\\" or \\"The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulders.\\"  He releases a personal account in each, and as a listener you can't help but believe him.  The intimacy shines through as does the details that even a seasoned reporter might not pick up on.  Illinois is half personal-eulogizing, half pulitzer-worthy feature writing.  Magaizine editors should be giving this album out to their reporters and say, \\"I want this - on paper.\\"   <br />I love the state of Illinios.  I don't know if this album reminds me of it, which may or may not be its intended purpose, but it definately gives me a frame of reference for what its like to live, love, and dream there.    <br /> <br />If Stevens makes Alabama sound this good, I'm calling fraud.
B00004IC9G|4.0|...A long, long time ago, in an emerginging age of spandex, makeup and hairspray, there was Manowar. Raw and yet brutal, this first album chronicles the genesis of a band that would forever remain true to a classic aproach to rock and heavy metal. All those who claim it is dated: OF COURSE IT IS!!!! This was 1982 people! But none the less, it is still a far more accomplished debut that those of other bands that followed in the next few years.  <br /> <br />Songs like 'Metal Daze' and 'Manowar' were the first of a metal-anthem theme that would re-occur in almost every album to follow. Tracks like 'Dark Avenger' and 'Battle Hymn' laid the frame for about 90% of the themes of their music henceforth (this being the very thing that one either loves or hates about Manowar). 'William's Tale', a Joey DeMaio arrangement of the 'William Tell Overture', shows that this is a band that has musical education and ability. Such a thing has become a tradition on basically every other record. When one looks and considers, with the seriousness of an educated music fan, all of these elements on a debut (not to metion a fantastic narration done by the brilliant and historically acclaimed Orson Welles), there is little that can be said to lay claim that this is a \\"forgetable and amateurish album\\". No, it is not their best. Most bands whose first was the best usually have only 2 or 3 albums at most. The best would indeed come later. But when you pit this recording against any other that came out that year, Manowar is the victor. And the silver edition remaster does this with great justice.
038533348X|5.0|[...]  Vonnegut skewers science, religion, families, human foibles, ... and does it with such a pleasently twisted story. The concept of Ice 9 is itself such an amazing absurdity. I read this book in college in 1968. I've read it six more times since then. My teenage son and daughter have also read it. It is now a family tradition. I rate this book as my favorite piece of literature. Don't pass this book by.
B00003ETJQ|5.0|The same way a poem uses words to transmit a feeling, this movie uses only images.  The power of the beauty and the horror, from the sublime to the ridiculous.  Images and photo are close to perfection, so is music. <br /> <br />Moving in a way we are no longer used to.  Some other reviewer said tissues are needed, well I agree.  Everybody must at least see this movie once.   <br /> <br />BTW This widescreen edition is superbe.
B00005OM4Q|4.0|O.k. be kind since I am going to be honest here.  I already own one copy of \\"Almost Famous.\\"  I bought it at Best Buy for $10.00.  It was the best ten dollars I've ever spent.  This is one of my favorite movies.  However, when I discovered Cameron Crowe made a \\"bootleg\\" version I could barely wait until pay day to go buy it.   <br /> <br />I didn't wait.  I borrowed money! <br /> <br />I go into the store.  One copy left.  I pick it up and stare at the price.  $29.00.  I stood there holding it for about six minutes.  Thirty dollars? I wanted it very much though, fueled by all the great reviews of it out here at amazon. <br /> <br />From reading the other reviews you are all probably familiar with the great special features.  There are two DVDs. The first DVD is the one that you want.   <br />   This DVD has the Director's cut- the longer version of the film.  It is a strange feeling to watch the scenes that have been cut and put back in.  I almost felt like I was watching something that really happened.  The music score is a little different then the theatrical version as well.  The best part of this though is the Directors Commentary.  It goes along with the longer version of the film, so you get to hear the goodie reasons why these scenes were cut.   As you all know, the real life inspiration for Elaine Miller-Alice Crowe accompanies Cameron on the commentary.  She is just like her character,  quoting Freud and others while commenting on things, \\"Remember when that happened Cameron?\\" or \\"Oh yes, this brings back memories.\\"  Cameron reveals a lot, has a very sharp memory,a good sense of humor, and does not hesitate to tell which experiences actually happened,(the de-flowering of William, much to the dismay of his mother, his sister finding him haggard in the S.F. Airport, one-very famous rock star shouting \\"I am a golden god\\" from the sunset strip, and the real life inspirations for his Stillwater band members.)  He talks about his experiences as young journalist-great information you will not be able to find anywhere else.   I believe the commentary is the thing that you will want to hear the most- and it is mysteriously missing from the first DVD release.   <br /> <br />Also on this DVD  is a short-very short-behind the scenes feature. (It's fun but could of been much longer) Maybe not more then five minutes.  Also if you play around with it, you will discover some hidden special features (not easy to find) that talk about Philip Seymour Hoffman's  eerie day of playing Lester.  Also on this DVD are some of the few Rolling Stone articles that Crowe wrote as a teen.  Which are actually very very good.  You can see why RS had him write for them.  Also is a fantastic clip of a Lester Bangs interview.  You can actually see him speaking and talking-in almost real life.  That would be very hard to find anywhere else.   <br /> <br />All my praises go out to Cameron for the DVD #1.  However, DVD #2 is practically identical to the version of Almost Famous I already own.  That was a little disappointing.  He did add the full length Stillwater concert in which the band plays 3 or 4 songs.  That was fun, because you do not see the full concert in the movie and it does contain the original full length theatrical version of the film, in case you do not own it already.  The third DVD is actually a CD with six full length still water songs.  It looks like a CD you would get as a promo at a live concert.  It's neat if you like to listen to fictitious band music.   <br /> <br />Overall...I think it is an awesome DVD #1, and it really gives the fan more to love about this movie.  You feel like you've been let into a birds eye view of this movie.  More importantly, a  honest and truthful look into Camerons real life experiences.  The rest of it?  Disappointing.  30 dollars is a lot of money to spend for one DVD.  If you do not already own Almost Famous, I think you will feel this is money well spent.  For me who already owns it? I'm a little sad about the rest of it.  I think it was a little pricey--but it was still money worth spending because I am such a huge fan.  <br />
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Anyone who labels this album as both 'commercial' and 'disappointing' at the same time, needs to go look up the meaning of a third word: 'Oxymoron'  Emphasis on the latter part of the word, perhaps.  There isn't a *commercial* bone in EC's body - remember, this is the man whose convictions drove him to leave a steady, well-paying gig when he thought it was getting too pop/fame-oriented and not about the music.  Things like that about a man don't change.  Ask your grandmother. <br /> <br />If - like some cynical, self-serving critics - you want EC to do a gritty, no-holds-barred blues rock album that will shake you to your roots and make you believe in sakes alive again...consider this: the man's done that before, done it countless times.  It's a valid position to want him to repeat himself for your sake and your pleasure.  But at the same time, isn't it enough to respect the man's wishes to say something else, for pete's sake?  At least try and understand that the angst and insecurity that drove EC's previous articulations has largely left him.  The old years when he continually tried to top himself and his heroes, those years were over the instant he found his own voice and along with that, humility. <br /> <br />For the actual review: If you appreciate honest songwriting and a man's effort to express what's fresh and new in his life in the best way he knows how, then buy this album.  The songs are well-written and well-ordered on the album.  As far as vocals go, you can tell EC's finally comfortable with his own singing and he feels it's at the point where it complements his guitar playing the way he always wanted it to.  That's the key word: Comfortable.  IMHO, this album is great for a Sunday drive. <br /> <br />Vocals: A-  (Clapton's been singing at his best for some time now) <br />Songwriting: B+  (EC's guitar playing has always somewhat 'lifted' the level of his songs; pretty much the same here) <br />Instrumentation: B  (Great guest musicians who add subtleflavor; fun if you know who you're listening for) <br />Guitar Heroics: B  (Safe warm ClaptonSong, as usual - were you expecting someone else?) <br />Overall: B+  (For comparison's sake - RBS: A; Layla...: A+; Reptile: C+/B-) <br /> <br />How anybody can be disappointed with this album scarcely a year after the brilliant RBS - well, it's beyond me.
0671673009|5.0|This is one of the most important books I think anyone can read.  It was recommended to a friend of mine in therapy and I decided to read it as well.   <br /> <br />The first sentence in the book is so profound.  \\"Life is difficult.\\"  For all of us who struggle and find that life is sometimes tough, this is not a revelation, but when you accept that fact, then you can rise above that concept.   <br /> <br />This book spoke to me on so many levels and I am certain that it is a book that I will read many many times.  It is making a deep change in my life right now as I peruse it for the first time.   <br /> <br />If you are tempted to buy this book, please do and read it with an open mind towards spiritual awakening.
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors burst onto the scene in 1960 something (sorry, I'm not incredibly educated in the subject of The Doors). This is their first album and features some of their most memorable songs like <br />\\"Light My Fire\\" & \\"Break on Through\\". This is a great debut album period. Every song on the album is good and you can listen to this album quite a few times without getting sick of it. Here are the tracks; <br /> <br />1. Break on Through-5/5-One of The Doors best songs. Awesome! <br />2. Soul Kitchen-5/5-Very cool keyboards in this one. <br />3. The Crystal Ship-5/5-I love this song, awesome lyrics. <br />4. Twentieth Century Fox-4/5-Cool song, but the lyrics (to me) are laughable. <br />5. Alabama Song-5/5-This song is great, lyrics are pretty funny but in a good way. <br />6. Light My Fire-4/5-People who have seen \\"The Doors\\" movie are probably really familiar with this song. I like this song, but I feel it is too long. The instrumental 3 minute or so thing in the middle of the song is OK, but I don't know...Not my favorite. <br />7. Back Door Man-5/5-\\"Eat your pork & beans\\" <br />8. I Looked At You-5/5-Really catchy song.  <br />9. End of the Night-5/5-Sounds a lot like the song \\"When the Music's Over\\" but still very cool. <br />10. Take It As It Comes-4/5-(No Comment) <br />11. The End-5/5-11+ minutes long, this is an amazing song. Going from singing to speaking, Jim Morrisons voice at times sounds haunting. Great song. <br /> <br />A+
B00006AW2J|3.0|I have been a listener of the Stones probably longer than most of you are of age. I want to give an HONEST critique as music  and the music business was changing. In this album,which was written completely by the J & R team headed in a different direction. Although the music was on the mark the content was always questioned by me. \\"Street Fightin' Man\\" was the top 40 hit. \\"Sympathy for the devil\\" a strange song to come from a R&R/ <br />R&B band with its lucifer connotations. Has a 'good dance beat' <br />but that was it. The illicit sex and under age sex thing   seemed present in, \\"Parachute Woman\\", strongly ( sex with minors? ) \\"Stray Cat Blues\\". Listen to the Words and see if I'm wrong. You tell me about \\"Factory Girl\\" There are only 10 songs on this disc and at this point I could see why Brian split from the band. There is no good time music in this album. Good musicianship yes. I was never keen on this one and I'll tell that to Micks face. Buy it only if you are a HARDCORE fan or collector.
B000002I2I|5.0|This is the third Doors album I have listened too and like the other album I've heard (their first one) this CD is awesome. I don't know what else to say but here's the tracks; <br />1. Roadhouse Blues-5/5-Very cool music to it, great song. <br />2. Waiting for the Sun-5/5-Lyrics are good. Song is pretty catchy. <br />3. You Make Me Real-4/5-Good lyrics. <br />4. Peace Frog-5/5-Catchy. Music, Vocals, and Lyrics are all great in this song. <br />5. Blue Sunday-4/5-I find the lyrics laughable, but there's nothing wrong with that. The song is still pretty good. <br />6. Ship of Fools-3/5-Just OK. Not the best song on the album. <br />7. Land Ho!-4/5-(No Comment) <br />8. The Spy-4/5-Interesting <br />9. Queen of the Highway-5/5-Good song. <br />10. Indian Summer-3/5-Slowest song on the album. Not terrible, just not the best on the album. <br />11. Maggie M'Gill-5/5-Great album closer.  <br />
B00006AW2P|5.0|Let me start this pragmatic way. Back in the British Invasion  ( musically ) this was the first album by the Rolling Stones released in the U.S. At the time of release their top 40 songs <br />were  \\" Not Fade Away \\" & \\" Tell Me \\". The other 10 were various reneditions made famous by other R & B artists. The unique talent of the Stones during this period was that they could take someone elses song and make it sound better ( A talent Van Halen had in the Diamond Dave era ). Everything from Rte#66 to Walkin' the Dog had the distinct touch only the \\"Brian\\" era Stones could give to an R & B piece. I recommend this as a BUY.
B000000XCH|4.0|I don't think John Fogerty wants his albums to be masterpeices. Although every one is memorable, I don't want them to, at least, be considered masterpeices.<br /><br />CCR, best known these days by their CHRONICLE 20 BEST album are just a little band from the late sixties/early seventies that are not really significant anymore.<br /><br />Oh wait, you mean they sang that song?<br /><br />Oh, and THAT ONE too?<br /><br />Get out of here, no, all of that?<br /><br />Its true kids, these guys were pretty great, and this stuff  never gets old. They all are the same in quality and persistance but this package is my personal favorite.<br /><br />HEARD IT THRU is one of the greatest band jams on record, over ten minutes of this song? Hell yes. The drum and bass are infectious. I always thought it was a CCR original. Oh well, best version I know of. However, the loaded version is also on chronicle.<br /><br />The best stuff on here though isn't on CHRONICLE and should not be missed. Like RAMBLE TAMBLE and LONG AS I CAN SEE THE LIGHT.<br /><br />This is a damn fine album for sure, but not a masterpeice, its not to be forgotten and can easily be played from start to finish. Just not everyday. Worth a peek, but if you want to get the party shakin' I would just get CHRONICLE.
B000003BF1|5.0|This is the one album that is almost as good as \\"out Of Our Heads\\". There is a legend about the title where Jagger and the boys did or could not think of a name for the disc. Jagger got this idea and called John Lennon ( they were friends ). Jagger asked if since the Beetles had \\"Let It Be\\" ( the good guys ),could the Stones call this one \\"Let IT Bleed\\". Pretty tricky, huh? <br />Every song on here is great ( one stinker - I'll never understand ). \\"Country Honk\\" instead of \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" which has some of the greatest guitar licks ever heard. Don't matter if you are a collector or new to Rock- it is a BUY & HOLD!
B0009S4IHY|4.0|This, like Shaolin Soccer before it, is an absurdly funny movie.  It is much in the style of the Naked Gun movies, however the humor is strongly based in the images and appearences of the main characters.  It has a cartoonish quality that is difficult to duplicate into a live action setting, but Chow does it almost flawlessly. <br /> <br />Not to mention the fight scenes are freakin' awesome.  If you liked Shaolin Soccer, you might as well buy this one right now.
B00006AW2L|4.0|In this album we see ( hear ) the showcasing of Brian Jones' true versatility of musicianship. In \\"Paint It Black\\" it is he  <br />( Brian Jones ) who plays the sitar. He also plays the dulcimer, <br />keyboards, and marimbas. The founding member of the Stones covered all bases on this except for lead vocals. <br /> <br />The 4 main tunes are \\"paint It Black\\", \\"Stupid Girl\\",the haunting \\"Lady Jane\\", and every mans dream song, \\"Under My Thumb\\". The other songs are marginally good except 2: \\"Flight 505\\"  (too depressing)and \\"Going Home\\" ( too damn long 11:35 ). <br />A good investment if you are a fan or a collector. It is OK otherwise.
B00008IHN1|1.0|Good Lord, how many of these movies do we have to see?  Cocky-but-brilliant misfit spends most of his time clashing with a) unsympathetic Establishment figures (in this case, the band director & the section leader) and b) the villain from the \\"rival\\" band.  In his spare time, he engages in a roller-coaster romance with a woman who just \\"doesn't get it,\\" that he just has to express himself in his own special way, even if he has to \\"break the rules.\\"  Ooooh, such drama, such conflict.  Of course, he ultimately is redeemed, as are all misunderstood individualistic, rule-breakin' heroes.  Blah blah blah blah blah.  One can see this ending coming from a mile away.  This tortuous storyline is broken up by seemingly endless band sequences, some that are not bad, others that really aren't as spiffy as some viewers may think.  Someone watching this on a DVD may be tempted to skip large numbers of scenes to get to the ending that all of us already know.<br /><br />Just a note on the believability of the whole \\"dude can't read music, but is such a genius that he can fake his way through anyway\\" premise which is one of the building blocks of the movie:  while I am not a percussionist, I am nonetheless a musician with 30 years professional experience, and I have NEVER had an audition for an ensemble where sight-reading was not involved.  Don't try and tell me that a fictional band that purports to be one of the best in the country holds half-assed auditions.  Sight-reading separates the wheat from the chaff.  Anyway, that is just my two cents on this particular issue.<br /><br />Holes in the plot such as that are entirely concealed by the massive number of movie cliches, in any case.  Save yourself the trouble.
B000000W5N|1.0|This was the start of the musical \\"end\\" of the Rolling Stones. <br />About the only 2 songs worth SPIT: Wild Horses & the C/W parody <br />Dead Flowers. ALL the other songs on this album sound like scrap left over from previous sessions. This album was originally released in 1971 ( about 2 plus years after Brians Jonses' death. Founder of the Rolling Stones ) Since 1968 - 9 they began moving away from their strength ( R & B ) and headed <br />into these uncharted waters. Most of the content of these songs <br />leave you empty. If you can borrow this album first, this is what I would advise. This album began to convert me from BEING a hardcore fan. It's a 2 song album folks, trust me.
B000059QYB|5.0|If you are trying to condense your CD collection this is one Greatest Hits album that I would recommend.
B000000W5B|2.0|I have to be brutally honest about this album. Of the 10 songs on the disc only 2 are worth anyones time: \\"Silver Train\\" and \\" Dancin' w/ Mr. D\\" ( I guess the D stands for Drac? ). \\"Silver Train\\" is a good road song while \\"Mr.D\\" has some great guitar work mainly' in part' thanks to Mick Taylor with Keith. The rest is give and take as far as I am concerned. In 1973 when this album was released I could HEAR that it was near the end for the Stones. When Mick Taylor left after this album, it was \\" ALL <br />OVER NOW \\" !!!! Buy at your own risk !!!!!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausicaa hime (princess on japanese), represents all the beauty and corage to protect her people and her belives. This is other Miyazaki's great pieces that you won't forget.
B000000W5H|3.0|Lets keep this one short and sweet.\\"Time Waits For No One\\" is their best effort on this. Mick Taylor was still the other guitar player and helped make Keith Richards look good. The heavily played ( on the radio ) \\"It's Only Rock And Roll\\" was the next best song. If you like the sound of Jaggers voice, beyond these 2, its a collection of 3 chord rock progression song for the most part. At that point in their careers they could have done a lot better. It's basically OK. As Jagger was onced quoted, \\"If we ( the Stones ) were starting in the music <br />business today, we wouldnt be able to make it\\".
0446677450|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Rich Dad Poor Dad. Mr. Kiyosaki inspires me to become wiser and more responsible with my income and how I will spend my income in the future. In my opinion every teenager needs to read this book, to become more business and financially savvy. I like how Mr. Kiyosaki tells people to listen, it is very good advise, and I have definitely took it into consideration. What I disliked about the book was that it was very detailed and Mr. Kiyosaki took a long time to get to his main points. It kept me reading and reading until I got to the main points, basically on the other hand it was very interesting and a very good growing experience in my financial knowledge. I would highly recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad to anyone and everyone who is interested in money, which is basically everyone!
B00001R3GI|4.0|As I critique this effort I do it with mixed feelings. It seems as if the Stones had tried to get back to being a rock band (not <br />a HARD rock band )but something kept getting in the way. What could that have been? To the point: it is a good album for the most part. I'll say 75% of the songs are good stuff and their sound is identifiable with most of it. I am a fan of 42 years so I have the right to be SOMEWHAT critical. Personally, I feel that \\"Soul Survivor\\" and \\"Happy\\" are the best efforts from the 'Boys' on this one. Borrow it first-if you can. Double albums are expensive.
B00079FUI6|4.0|\\"Desperate Housewives\\" is a witty and amusing look at the antics of four suburban women whose lives change dramatically after the suicide of a neighboring housewife.  Much like \\"American Beauty\\" or \\"Six Feet Under\\", the show mixes humor, drama, and satire to explore the underbelly of contemporary American society.  While the performances of the main cast members are all good, my favorite is Marcia Cross, who brings a touch of the bizarre and mysterious to her character of perfectionist Bree Van De Camp.  Cross creates one of the most memorable characters of recent TV. Fans of Ms. Cross should also check her out in LIVING IN FEAR (2001) and the hard-to-find FEMALE PERVERSIONS (1996), which is sort of a percursor to \\"Desperate Housewives\\" in its portrait of female angst and also the only film in which Cross (who has a small role as Tilda Swinton's mom) appears topless.
B00006AW2M|1.0|When the Beetles came out with Sgt Peppers album this was the Stones answer. They would have been better off passing the studio by on this effort. Example: \\"Shes a Rainbow\\", this is a Rolling Stones song? COME ON!! I can't think of 1 song that is worth your time to listen toon this one. I am a guitarist and this is one that did'nt need the guitar players in the studio at that time. My question would be to them, \\"Why would you want to leave your strengths\\"? I guess they just wanted to hodge-podge some s--t and make some money. Be smart -pass on this one!!!!
B000683VI4|2.0|**SPOILERS**<br /><br />**1/2<br /><br />\\"The Notebook\\" is a trite, hackneyed tale of a poor little rich girl who falls in love with a boy from the wrong side of the tracks.  It's South Carolina in the 1940's, and Allie Hamilton is a highly educated, ambitious young lady living under the watchful eyes of her snooty, upper crust parents who have pretty much mapped out her whole life for her.  Enter Noah Calhoun, a poor working class boy with a devil-may-care spirit and a zest for living whom Allie falls instantly in love with while she and her parents are staying in town one summer.  One look at their daughter's pawing this strapping young man from the lower social orders and the parents are hightailing it back to Charleston with the wayward Allie in tow, bringing an end to a flaming summer romance that somehow manages to live on through a subsequent world war (involving the least emotional war buddy death scene in movie history), Allie's engagement to a wealthy veteran, her eventual Alzheimer's, and Noah`s disturbingly scraggly beard (he`s too depressed to shave, you see).<br /><br />Even though Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are appealing as the two young lovers, very little about \\"The Notebook\\" feels either original or genuine.  It seems, in fact, to have been cobbled together from other, considerably more impressive tales of unrequited love in which wealth and class play a key role in keeping the lovers apart.  The sad truth is that most of what happens to the pair smacks of dime-novel sentimentality and phoniness.  For instance, after a night of powerhouse lovemaking between the newly reunited lovers, Allie wakes up to find herself alone with only a note from Noah telling her to follow the arrows to a surprise.  And, lo and behold, what do we see but a long line of arrows lying on the floor leading from the bedroom to a sitting room down the hall.  Now, is it really conceivable that Noah sat up all night with a scissors cutting out perfectly formed paper arrows, or is this just one of those scenes that could happen only in the movies?  And why does Allie's mother keep all those letters from Noah - 365 of them in one year! - that she carefully hid from her daughter, only to turn them over to Allie years later all tightly wrapped up in a neat little bundle?  And I won't even go into the final scene of the movie, which is the worst case of expediency over credibility that I've seen in a movie in a long long time.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, the film, written by Jan Sardi and Jeremy Levin, and directed by Nick Cassavetes, has been structured as one giant flashback, in which a now aged Noah (James Garner) is reciting the tale to Allie (Gena Rowlands), who is suffering from what the doctor calls \\"senile dementia\\" and so doesn't realize that the story is about them.  This approach brings a certain added poignancy to the film - or at least it would were it not undercut by the sappiness of Garner's voiceover narration and that far too heavy-handed conclusion.  Joan Allen gives her usual dependable performance as Allie's mother, although her character's 180 degree turnabout at the end seems more a matter of convenience than a carefully though-out metamorphosis within her character.  At least the movie doesn't turn Allie's fiance into an unreasonable and hateful villain.  The writers do, at least, deserve some credit for that.<br /><br />In a final note, the film isn't even careful with its period details.  For instance, there's a shot (supposedly during war time or immediately thereafter) of characters leaving a movie theater with \\"On the Town\\" splashed across the marquee.  The problem is that the film wasn't even released until 1949!r arrows, or is this just one of those scenes that could happen only in the movies?

At least the movie doesn't turn Allie's fiance into an unreasonable and hateful villain.  The writers do, at least, deserve some credit for that. <br /> <br />In a final note, the film isn't even careful with its period details.  For instance, there's a shot (supposedly during war time or immediately thereafter) of characters leaving a movie theater with \\"On the Town\\" splashed across the marquee.  The problem is that the film wasn't even released until 1949!
B00006AW2O|5.0|Getting to it, 12 x 5 ( meaning 12 songs performed by 5 band members ) was a continuation of the ' boys ' great R & B musicianship. The top 40 releases were, \\" Time is on My Side \\" & \\" It's All Over Now \\". These 2 aforementioned early works of the Stones set them apart from all the other English bands ( mainly the Beetles ). Back in the time the Stones were the <br /> ' bad guys ' and the Beetles were the ' good guys '. Of the 12 songs on this work, 3 were written by J & R. Their skills were improving and the music was ' grooving '. One strange piece is 2120 S. Michigan Ave. Reason being, it is an INSTRUMENTAL. Go figger! If you are over 45 or a REAL R&B fan, git it !!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Who knows why this show was canceled.  Bad time slot?  Bad ad campaign?  Who knows!?  But what's important is that this show is now on DVD as well as 2 other mediums : )!  First off, the show takes place in the distant future, one 6 years after a galatic civil war.  On the losing side, Captain Malcom Reynolds, a former Seargent and famed veteran of that war, who only has his pride left.... and a  Firefly class transport ship called Serenity, which is loaded with a crew as odd as the show being called Firefly rather then Serenity.  With a crew of 9, you would be hard pressed to find someone you couldn't like.  I rather not go into who is who and all that stuff, due to the fact that I... am lazy.  Unlike other Joss Whedon shows, this one has very little camp, but makes up for it in excellent special effects, and great dialog that makes the show funny beyond belief.  A show for sci fi fans as well as Buffy/Angel fans.   <br />Now to clear up a few things, their is this show, a movie and a small series of comics.  The 3 Comics, produced by darkhorse, tell the story of what happens between the end of the series and the movie, so fans of this DVD, I encourage you to go out and get the comics.  Though many questions are still unanswered, I know I had plenty, they do set the stage for the Movie.  They do explain more of the infamous \\"hands of blue\\".  The movie can be watched, from the several reviews I have read, without either dvds or comics.  But who would want to go into a story half way? <br />Anyways, get this DVD set.  NOW!
B000AU9UYM|4.0|Batman is a thread in the fabric of everyday life in the U.S. There aren't many little boys who haven't once dreamed of being Batman.  <br /> <br />Batman is different from Superman, the X-Men, Spiderman, Aquaman, or the Green Lantern - he's simply a man. He has no super human powers. He doesn't fly, wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider, isn't a mutant, and cannot breathe underwater. Batman is nothing more than the secret identity of the very human Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br />Bruce sought solice in revenge and empowerment in order to fight the very forces of evil that destroyed his family. Oh, he's a very priviledged man (he'd have to be in order to have access to all the very expensive gadgetry that he has at his command), but he's still nothing more than a very strong man - with a iron steel will and fortitude that is quite oftem more strong and resourceful than any of those displayed by the super humans elsewhere written about in comics. <br /> <br />Batman Begins takes us on a journey as described in the Dark Knight comic series. It reinvented the Batman in a very human and more accessible manner. The film does the same. <br /> <br />Nolan's Gotham City may not be New York, but it IS a city from the look of it, not some nightmare vision of a city as Burton envisioned. <br /> <br />Rather than create a nonexistent mythos, Nolan gives us believabe corporate greed and believably corrupt police. Even the \\"super villain\\" of the film is one that is truly grounded in reality: he's not super at all - he's just really really creepy: the Scarecrow. <br /> <br />The Scarecrow has always been one of my favorite villains, because he is so truly believable. The Joker, the Penguin, and the Riddler were all created during WWII. They were villains of the Dick Tracy variety: sinister and evil, but not quite real. <br /> <br />The Scarecrow is nothing more than a psychiatrist who knows how to get inside people's heads using hallucinogenic drugs. Batman Begins' Scarecrow is a business suit wearing creep, who dons a scarecrow mask after he's dosed his victims with his paranoia-inducing drug. The effect is quite creepy on screen. Further the reality quotient of it is high. <br /> <br />Batman Begins is a drama at its heart. It is an action film in its soul. And it is a super hero film in name only. Batman Begins could be a Jackie Chan film, Clint Eastwood, or film of  some similar genre. It falls not too far afield of reality and in doing so builds believability and stregnth. <br /> <br />Finally, there's the thespian chops this film boasts. This is no super-duper big budget name dropping film (there's no terribly miscast Arnold Schwarzenegger).  <br /> <br />This film has actors not names. Just off the radar actor Christian Bale stars as Batman. Bale is known to many for his thoughtful and intense portrayals in lesser known Hollywood and independent films. <br /> <br />Alfred, the dutiful butler is played by Michael Caine (not overacting or lazy as he can often be); the incredibly fine actor, Morgan Freeman, gives this film further believabity in his subtly nuanced performance as Lucius Fox. Detective Gordon (who later becomes Commissioner Gordon) is underplayed wonderfully by the incredible Gary Oldman. Rounding out this impressive cast are Katie Holmes (who is quite good and who's character is actually allowed to exist beyond mere window dressing) as Batman's childhood girlfriend; Rutger Hauer as the president of Wayne Enterprises, delivering a performance that may put him back on the radar; irish actor Cillian Murphy gives us the super villain as organized crime's pawn - or is he?; Ralph Fiennes as Ra's Al'Ghul is perfectly cast; and Tom Wilkenson is the head of Gotham's organized crime demonstrates that crime in Gotham doesn't need a mask to be powerful. <br /> <br />Batman Begins is the version we have been waiting for since Warner Brothers announced it was making one (back in 1985). We've been waiting twenty years for the real thing to bedelivered. One decent version and three no show versions of Batman in the past twenty years... Where is the real Bathman? Now we have it....Batman Begins is the TRUE beginning for what I hope will be a real Batman franchise.
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|I really thought Franz Ferdinand were something more than just a copy/paste of the past. Their image, album and single sleeves, music... everything is dejavu, but repackaged to be a bit more modern. Nothing sensational, inspirational or new. <br /> <br />Two stars for not doing hip-hop, which is the worst music ever produced.
0345403959|4.0|After reading the Belgariad and while waiting for the Mallorean to publish in two volumes, I read this book. I'm not much of a fan or reader of fanatasy, but I've enjoyed this series greatly. Outstanding character development and good action make this series very readable and tough to put down. Belgarath The Sorcerer provides details that support the overall series. I'm working on the Mallorean now. I'm not looking forward to seeing this series completed after spending so much time reading all the books.
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater was defined by this album for a long time and even more so with a song that DT says that they \\"just threw together\\".  The first song on this CD, \\"Pull Me Under\\", is a compelling musical and lyrical achievement.  After hearing this track, I was hooked into Dream Theater.  There are great tracks on this CD, and it grows on you.  My favorites include (obviously) Pull Me Under, Metropolis, Wait for Sleep and Learning to Live because they expand  musically like a few bands have ever done and even against some of DT's later material.  As a DT fan, I had to get used to other albums since this was the first DT album I had heard.  There is a noticeable difference in recording techniques versus other DT albums. This is an essentail CD for any DT fan.
B000AA4LAK|5.0|Chances are that if you're reading this, you don't need to read another stellar review of Hot Fuss. In my opinion, it's the best debut album I've heard in a long time, and The Killers are the best new band I've heard in probably the last five years.<br /><br />If you're reading this, I probably don't need to tell you about Brandon Flower's haunting voice, I probably don't need to tell you about the wonderfully infectious riffs and beats that are woven through this entire glorious album, I don't need to tell you how great in general Hot Fuss is, because I'm sure you already know! So I'll just stick to reviewing the three extra tracks...<br /><br />Track 12: \\"Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll\\" - This is my favorite of the three. The chorus is a TAD repetitive, but it's more than compensated by the change-ups in rhythm and Brandon's stellar vocal performance throughout, though my favorite part is Brandon's brief falsetto at the end of the line, \\"bet your, your bottom dollar on me.\\" The song soars and your heart will soar along with it.<br /><br />Track 13: \\"The Ballad of Michael Valentine\\" - The worst of the three. The melody is halting, I like the lyrics but the song just doesn't really go anywhere. The chorus really takes off at first, but then lets you down when Brandon's voice turns screamy and cracked. It's clearly intentional, and it's quite Bowie-esque in my opinion, but I feel that it just really doesn't work with the rest of the song, and pretty much spoils the whole thing for me.<br /><br />Track 14: \\"Under The Gun\\" - I really believe that this song should have been on the original release of the album. It has \\"single\\" practically written all over it. The song is catchy yet moody, the lyrics are inspiring, and it's much more interesting guitar-wise (as well as being a better song in general) than \\"Andy, You're A Star\\" - which is my least favorite song on Hot Fuss. But that's just my opinion :)<br /><br />So, while it may not seem that way, I think that these three extra tracks were definitely worth buying the album again, although I agree with another reviewer who stated that we should have gotten the rest of the b-sides that have been released.hese three extra tracks were definitely worth buying the album again, although I agree with another reviewer who stated that we should have gotten the rest of the b-sides that have been released.
B000002JKA|4.0|This album took a while to grow on me because of its morose and dark textures.  I was looking for a band that sounded like Images and Words, but that isn't necessarily the case here.  This is an emotional roller coaster ride provided by the heart-wretching tales of breakup and dispair.  The 3-part Erotomania-Voices-Silent Man and Lie are strong musically and lyrically and is about the heaviest this CD gets.  Lifting Shadows Off a Dream lightens the mood but not by much.  I have to agree with other reviewers that Space-Dye Vest is not for people with weak constitutions or those going through emotional times as it will pull at your heart.  It is one of the most emotional (and depressing) songs I have ever heard.  Awake is the last DT album with keyboardist, Kevin Moore.  This CD is a must have for DT fans, but since it is such a dark album, it is hard to give a strong recommendation otherwise.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Hauntingly Beautiful. <br />This album transcends all music boundaries and no-one should be without it. <br />1 - The Man Comes Around is a beautiful yet powerful song about the judgement day and Christ coming back to Earth that Cash wrote himself. Significant because Cash knows his judgement day is drawing close and you can hear the bittersweet pain in his voice. <br />2 - Hurt. I get goosebumps every time i hear this and i honestly do have to fight back tears. it is tragically moving and the video is a ruthless, harsh heartbreakingly beautiful video. The best video of all time. <br />3 - Give My Love To Rose - this version is even better than Cash's younger ones. His wavering voice gives a sense of sadness. This song is a little less devestating as the previous 2. <br />4 - Bridge Over Troubled Water - A fantastic cover of the simon and Garfunkel classic. Cash adds a unique element that Art Garfunkel struggles to. He makes the song his own and each line is sung with a stark realistic delivery. <br />5 - I Hung My Head - Superb. This song is almost like the life Cash lived and has sang about decades. Faced with guilt the man flees them closest instead of owning up. Reminiscent of Cas's addictions. It is sung Brilliantly by Cash. <br />6 - First Time Ever I Saw Your Face - Cash has a unique ability to cover any song and make it his own ( Hurt and Bridge Over Troubled Water to name just a few) and he is at his best with this one. Sad, moving and poignant. Fantastic. Especially when you add the fact Cash was married for nearly for 40 years this song sounds so true. <br />7 - Personal Jesus - Cash speeds things up a little as he offers support to us just like God and June Carter ( his wife ) did to him over the years. Cash reverses roles to \\"play\\" Jesus to us sinners. <br />8 - In My Life - Amazing cover of the Lennons classic. This song rings so true when one bears in mind Cash's rollercoaster life. Brilliant. <br />9 - Sam Hall - adds the badass aspect to this albumwhich Cash has possessed all his life. He has recorded this song before but it sounds even better with age. A real gem. <br />10 - Danny Boy - just amazing. The pain in Cash's voice is clearly noticeable singing this \\"funeral\\" Irish classic. Slow, Cash's voice weakens a few times but it makes it better. <br />11 - Desperado - Beautiful cover of the Eagles song.  <br />12 - Im So Lonesome I Could Cry - My least favourite song of the album but it is still a good song. Cash sings it with Hank Williams Jr. <br />13 - Tear Stained Letter - an upbeat song of a man scarred by his love leaving him and he thraetens her with telling everyone their secrets. <br />14 - Streets Of Laredo - Beautiful song about a young Cowboy dying and coming to terms with it. Quite like Cash himself. <br />15 - We'll Meet Again - A lighthearted song about Cash's imminent death. Made easier by the fact his loved ones will see him in Heaven.  <br />16 - Big Iron - A great song to finish the album. Story about a man who conquered all odds by killing a the quickest villian in The Wild West. A True Outlaw's Song. Brilliant. <br />This is a GREAT  testimony to the legend that is Johnny Cash. <br />Forever remembered, Never forgotten <br />Thank you Johnny <br />Rest In Peace and God Bless <br />Thank You.
B000063DIH|4.0|i was a little iffy about getting this cd at first because of the reviews i read...BUT when i finally picked it up, i thought \\"these guy's are morons, this is a really good maiden album!!\\". although there are some tracks that are really bad. it seemed like maiden didn't even try, but hey, thats me. <br /> <br />1.Be Quick or Be Dead-*7/10*- good song, heavy, but not the best song on the album. <br />2.From Here To Eternity-*6/10*-i love the opening to this song, but other than that i thought it was pretty bad...the solo, i think, is possibly the best part of this song...but thats me. <br />3.Afraid to Shoot Strangers-*7/10*-VERY weak song by maiden. but it starts to get a little better around 2:45 into the song. <br />4.Fear Is the Key-*1/10*-possibly THE worst song i've heard from maiden. and the lyrics are just terrible. nothing in this song is worth listening to except for the solo (of course). <br />5.Childhood's End-*10/10*-to me this is the best song on the album because it is just plain freaking awesome!!! the drum work is something to smile at in this song. <br />6.Wasting Love-*7/10*-this song is atleast pretty decent. the lyrics are REALLY good and the guitar work is half decent =). it gets really good later in the song. <br />7.The Fugitive-*5/10*-i'll give it an \\"eh\\" rating becuase, personally, i think its neither good nor bad. the lyrics are good though =). <br />8.Chains of Misery-*6/10*-very catchy when you listen to it for the first couple of times. but after a while it'll get boring and repetitive. <br />9.The Apparition-*1/10*-just plain terrible... <br />10.Weekend Warrior-*5/10*-i think this song was meant as a joke, but i'll admit i like the beginning a lot and the solo but other than that its not very good. <br />11.Fear of the Dark-*10/10*-no matter how many times you listen to this song, you'll never get tired of it. this is one of the best iron maiden songs so far. <br /> <br />BUY THIS CD!!! ITS AWESOME!!!!-minus a few songs... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
1402714580|5.0|This hardbound book by Louisa May Alcott is a MUST for anyone wanting a truly \\"good\\" book for their child or themselves to read.  The book is printed on quality paper and beautiful cover.  There is also a bookmark incorporated into the binding to keep your place.  We have used this with the Unabridged story on CD to help the younger children with their reading.  They can listen and follow along.  It is a quality story, a timeless classic, in a quality binding.  It far surpassed what I had expected in terms of paper, binding, etc.  I am so happy we got this book, and the price was more than reasonable for what we received!
B00004ZD69|5.0|Call it pretentious or what have you, but there's something irresistable about the sweeping orchestrations of Godspeed You! Black Emperor. This double cd is the epitome of their sound done right, it's almost as if you could close your eyes and imagine a story playing out ten times more epic than the most incredible hollywood blockbuster. Waves of crescendoing sound and beauty wash over each of the four 20 minute+ long tracks. Sparse guitar that rises to a deafing caucaphony, pounding drums, and trembling strings, mournful bagpipe, as well as sound clips that, while possibly out of left field, are condusive to the feeling of the album. To be listened to in one sitting if at all possible.
B000068PQ0|5.0|The Flaming Lips had awesome guitar on their earlier albums, true this one lacks that awesome guitar like they use to have, its a bit more electronic, but so what, its a very cool and unique album. They still use guitars just with a different distortion, because if you're not experimental then everything just sounds the same year after year. Flaming Lips are flippn' awesome. Don't listen to anyone who gives them a bad reveiw, especially if they think the best album ever is Sean Paul - Dutty Rock. Also, the cover of this album is great, very imaginative, but don't judge an album or anything by its cover.<br /><br />Best Songs: Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1, In the Morning of the Musicians, Fight Test, Do You Realize? and It's Summertime. The rest are great as well.<br /><br />Still I would check these albums out Soft Bulletin, Clouds Taste Metallic, Transmissions..., Hit to Death in the Future Head and a nice little not very known and very underated Oh My Gawd Flaming Lips!!
0553573403|5.0|I'm at the end of the second book at this time and thought I'd do a short review.<br /><br />Mainly I wanted to say that while this is a great series, it should probably have some sort of parental advisory on it.  Let's just say the man likes his sex scenes.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just sayin'.  This is a series aimed squarely at an adult audience.<br /><br />After reading the Wheel of Time series, I was directed to this series with the promise that it was \\"even better\\".  Having really liked the Wheel of Time I was doubtful, but now I'm in full agreement.<br /><br />I have some issues with Robert Jordan's writing, particularly the way he likes to introduce minor characters, then drop them, then have them show back up 2 books later with no re-introduction.  I end up going, \\"Who is this??\\"  George R.R. Martin has a pretty wide cast of main characters but he goes back to them again and again, never letting one drop for very long.  It makes the books a lot more pleasent reading for me rather than some sort of memory game.<br /><br />The plot itself is, if anything, even more interesting than the Wheel of Time and you never know what he's going to do next.  Suffice to say that Martin is not afraid to kill off main characters.  The plot twists and turns as we follow the lives of these families, always keeping enough connections that I can't wait for another chance to get back to reading but always with enough uncertainly that I don't feel bored reading about a character I know he won't kill.<br /><br />I was afraid that a book involving a lot of \\"political intrigue\\" would be ponderous or boring but it's very well done.  Whereas a lot of dramas (especially on TV) are created by putting a lot of annoying drama queens together on a stage, this series has real edge-of-your-seat intrigue and drama, the kind that pulls you in because you identify with and care for the characters.<br /><br />It's solid writing and easily the best fantasy series I've ever read.y series I've ever read. <br />
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|it's hard to know if SOAD are serious or trying to make a joke with the direction this is going. which, to me, is what makes this cd so mezmerize-ing. from political lyrics about our nation's actions, to critical hollywood satire, to lyrics that about made me pee my pants laughing. \\"my *ock is bigger than yours, my *ock can walk right out the door!\\" are you for real!?! \\"tony danza cuts in line!\\" - not in any metal song i've ever heard!?! \\"choking chicks and sodomy, the kinda sh+t you see on your tv\\" - which channel is that? gotta give it to them though: i'm hooked. i dont care if you want to compare it to \\"steal this album\\" or \\"toxicity\\". for me it's a different animal altogether. after 30 or so listens, i love the switch between scorching screams, super heavy headbanging rock, wierd-electronic rants and transcendant ballad-y preachiness. cant wait for part deux.
6305971099|3.0|Halloween 5 isnt bad...it's just not great.  They could have made it a lot better.  One of the main characters dies in the first half of the movie (Rachel).  A lot of the characters besides Jamie Lloyd perish in the movie, including Jamie's older sister Rachel along with many of her friends. You don't find out what happens to Rachel's best friend at the end.  You also don't find out who that mysterious man in black is who helps out Michael in his killing spree(until Halloween 6).  Many mysteries are left unsolved after 5 which in mostly all of the cases is a very bad thing. The movie continues from Halloween 4 and Jamie is in an asylum at the vewry beginning where Rachel and her best friend are visiting. Dr. Loomis is up to his investigations and hunting once again and he makes the movie as good as it can be.  The ending is a HUGE letdown if you don't like to be left hanging. This movie is over the top with that, because we never hear from Jamie again, and we are left at the end of the movie with her in a police station, crying, while all of the cops are dead. Cmon... Anyway, One thing I will say is that it's a lot better than Halloween 8.  Hopefully Halloween 9: Retribution will make the fans happy.  I'm looking forward to it.
0553382179|5.0|I suppose I don't fall into the sterotypical FlyBaby category. My husband & I don't have any children.  I spend most of my week in the office, shuttling from one meeting to the next. I am not a stay at home wife or mother. <br /> <br />Yet, although FlyLady's tips and routines may seem obvious to some, they weren't obvious to ME. I am not depressed. I am a very confident, intellegent, successful professional. But when it came to my home, it was totally out of control. And I kept falling into the trap of thinking that the CHAOS of our home must be due to some complex, time management problem. <br /> <br />I've never been much of a pack-rat, neither has my husband. So, the amount of clutter in our home was minimal (though there was SOME...especially in our attic, laundry room and garage). Our problem has always been trying to find a way to keep up w/ the daily chores of life. My husband & I both spend our mornings & evenings fighting grid-lock traffic in the city. We spend the majority of day running from meeting to meeting in our respective careers.  We get home at night, exhausted most of the time. Nobody wants to cook. Nobody wants to clean.  Nobody wants to pick up and put stuff away, or throw out the stuff we don't need. <br /> <br />Then the weekend rolls around & we're playing \\"catch up.\\" No time for us or our marriage. Nope. On Saturday morning its time for grocery shopping, errands, household chores, laundry, you get the point. A year into our marriage & we realized how much we MISSED each other. And honestly, we REFUSED to hire a cleaning service. IMO, there is NO REASON why we need to PAY for someone to clean up after 2 people.  No reason at all.  But we both agreed that we HAD to do something. We didn't enjoy coming home after a long day at work anymore.  The place was a MESS by mid-week, every week. <br /> <br />Then, I found FlyLady. My husband thought I was crazy at first. I think he was waiting for me to start wearing pearls around the house & acting like Martha Stewart (which I imagine frightened him because he did NOT marry a Martha Stewart-type woman). But in a matter of 2 weeks, I was amazed at the results and my hubbie was singing a new tune. <br /> <br />FlyLady's system, though obvious to some, was an enormous help to us! Through her suggestion, we signed up for the Weekly Menu Mailer. No guess-work on dinner anymore! We're saving money on groceries. Regardless of which one of us get's home from work first, \\"what's for dinner?\\" is always simple answer. Just whip out the recipe and get cooking! Usually w/in 20 minutes, we're sitting down to a great meal...every single night.  No more staring at the pantry dumb-founded.  And you'd be amazed at what a good cook my husband has become!  GOODBYE, MCDONALD'S! <br /> <br />The weekly routines have been amazing, as well. We keep our Control Journal (listing all our routines) on the kitchen counter. If I get delayed at work, I come home to find that hubbie just needed to look up the day and he knew what tasks needed to be done.  We both pitch in, with an ORGANIZED PLAN OF ATTACK, every single day. <br /> <br />And the best part? On the weekends we have time for US. We bought a sailboat earlier in the year. We had taken it out all of 2 times when we started FlyLady. Well, if this past weekend is any indication of how well her system works, we spent a solid FIVE HOURS on our boat on Saturday....with no worries that we were neglecting any household obligations. <br /> <br />Thank you, FlyLady. Sometimes a busy executive can't see the trees for the forest.  Your simple little system has made such a difference in our home!
B00000IN5G|5.0|This is one of the best CD purchases I have ever made.     Where to start? All of the songs are noteworthy. Every single one. And that is RARE. Alexi is one of the best guitarists of the new generation. He does vocals, too, which is amazing since (as any guitarist and aspiring vocalist would know) you have to concentrate less on guitar playing (it is very hard to do). A+     Hatebreeder blends awesome riffs and blistering speed to make some very stunning songs, with complex guitar leads followed by unusual bass lines and drum rhythms. Not so melodic as the later album Follow the Reaper, but this album makes up for it with raw emotional power.    Children of Bodom's best album by far. Get this album if you want an introduction to Children of Bodom, or are an already dedicated fan who has yet to pick this up.    Nothing less than 5 stars!
B0002PZVHK|5.0|Imagine perhaps that Eno has penetrated the consciousness of lazy reptiles who lay about and chew on psychedelic mushrooms and he was somehow able to translate their experience into 'music'.  This is one incredible, unique work of art. I don't play it a lot, but when I do, I always remember why I love it.  Great for creating alone at night around 4 AM.
B00028HBKM|1.0|this was a 2 hour snuff film and im sad i saw it. the movie didnt have a single thread of of moral value,and nothing about what mad jesus great. all it shows is that jesus could take a beating and anyone who walks away from this thinking they are a better person for it is sick.to many people over look the fact that its so incredibly violent just because they say its historicaly acurate. well so what that would be like making a movie about joan of arc that is 2 hours of her smoldering on the stake and not about her passion(please mel if you read this dont make a movie out of it). all in all dont waste your time with this movie unless you are looking for a gore flick.  <br />
052594527X|2.0|This was neither deep nor meaningful, but it was entertaining. The author did a good job of taking you into the character and setting - it felt like you were there. In short, the main character and setting were well done, the plot was thin. Still, a worthwhile beach book.
B00008A7QK|5.0|Holy hell! This record is, to put lightly, born to boogie. The aesthetic appeal is astounding. The melodies surprise me with each progression the album takes, even now. Still. I've been a little lax with my 5 star reviews. I've allowed some filler to creep in. This has no filler (taking the album in its original context, without the bonus tracks). I can't even try to find filler here.     This is my driving album. I listen to it in the car for the most part. I don't know why. It just works. And it's perfect.     I'm not even going to bother mentioning lone songs here. You and I both know that those who read these reviews are looking for key songs to try out before purchasing the album. No. No! No food for you!    (I'm also not going to mention the kickass packaging this remaster includes because next to the album itself, it's nothing more but a leaflet)
B000000IW9|5.0|FACTS <br /> <br />This album delves into Blues quite a bit more than just about any main stream hard rock band before or since has even thought of attempting to do. If you like Blues, that's a good thing. Most of the songs are melodic, and all of the lyrics are emotional and intense (occasionally poignant, frequently profane, once in a while inane). In addition to Blues, this album (and it's counterpart) also attempts a grand scope, a story to tell, and a broad diversity paradoxically coupled with a running theme, which is what prompts the ambiguous \\"epic\\" label from many fans (myself among them). It is in that vein that G'n'R can once in a while draw comparisons to Pink Floyd -- right down to the fact that their music tore them apart and their front man was a reclusive, tortured genius and/or control freak (take your pick between Waters or Barrett). <br /> <br />OPINIONS <br /> <br />Every other review you will read here. Message to readers: it's quite possible to like both G'n'R and Nirvana without \\"missing\\" what either band was really about. It's not necessary to generalize fans of one band or the other. And it's certainly not necessary to pay disrespects to a man who was so conflicted he blasted his own head to pieces. That's great that you're a drama queen G'n'R fan, but leave Cobain out of it, and stop taking shots at fans of other types of music. My lord. One thing has nothing to do with the other. <br /> <br />Another opinion (this one my own): One of the greatest albums of all time.

You will do better to buy the better-colored deck by itself (091386613X, $12.24 here at Amazon) and get yourself a good introductory book (I like: 1578630487, but there are many).  Go to a local New Age or Occult bookshop, find what you like, write down the ISBN then buy it cheaper at Amazon.

1400031362|3.0|This complicated book about African culture is a follow up of THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY, (there are several volumes already available of the life and times of Pracious Ramotswe), investigator extraordinaire.  She is called \\"The Miss Marple of Botswana\\" by the New York Times Book Review.  These books combined are being currently made into a t.v. series.    In this one, she is called upon by an important \\"Government Man\\" to investigate the poisoning of his beloved brother.  As she tries to get to the core of the matter in her inimitable way, her fiancee needs help with his car repair business and she goes into the garage business in a big way to help him out, \\"Under New Management.\\"  In the nineteen chapters, we run into a plethory of characters totally out-of-this-world.      She also gets involved in the 'Miss Beauty and Integrity Contest' and must determine the moral character of the four finalists in the beauty pageant, the winner who could become Miss Bostwana.  The questions they will be asked include: \\"What are the main values which Africa can show to the world?\\";  \\"What do you want to do with your life?\\" and \\"Is it better to be beautiful than to be full of integrity?\\"  The Chief Justice of Beauty will decide the winner, who must be the most excellent type of girl.    On the way to the Fair on the KAT bus, I saw two ceremonial personages. The man had on a long robe with an elaborate headdress and tall walking stick. The woman, alien like Diane, was barefooted and dressed colorfully with a scarg around hre head, a bright, eye-pleasing blouse with a long skirt (similar to my dull peacock skirt -- I have a bright one also) and her very presence spoke voodoo. They were not a part of the Fair.     Alexander Smith has written fifty books including CHILDREN OF WAX, TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE, and THE SUNDAY PHILOSOPHY CLUB.  He also wrote THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN and THE FULL CUPBOARD OF LIFE,  among others.  The beautiful birds on the covers of his booksare glorious with their plumes on top and colorful configurations.  One looks to be fancy crane mixed with peacock; the other is colorful and spectacular.
0684830515|1.0|Having previously read - and enjoying immensly Hemingways \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\\" this was a disapointment. I did not understand this book. It was neither entertaining, funny, deep, or even enjoyable. Nothing happened. I have no idea why it is a so called classic, and do not recommend it.
B00000099Y|5.0|I've had this cd for a while now and i have to say it's a masterpiece. This has a wide range of sounds, themes, and a great followup to the other Tool masterpiece Undertow. The music is very deep with emotion.  <br />Some of the best songs on here are pretty much all of them, except for maybe some of the fillers. My all time favorite on here is probably Stinkfist, one of my favorite songs which i think is about a drug addiction. <br />If you've never heard Tool and thinking about buying a cd by them, dont even hesitate. All of their cds are great and its hard to choose a favorite, a lot of people will say Aenima, though. Maynard James Keenan, Adam Jones, Justin Chancellor, and Danny Carey made a masterpiece, buy it

B00008YJH5|5.0|To put it simply, The Pixies are music Gods. No band does straightforward indie rock as good as them, and it's likely that no one ever will. I'd easily place them in the Top 10 rock bands of all time. Arriving on the music scene at a time where hair-metal nonsense was polluting the airwaves, The Pixies responded to it by making music that was everything that hair metal wasn't: Creative, strange, silly, and completely free of any cheesiness. Their 1988 debut \\"Surfer Rosa\\" is their best album, and a strong contender for best album of the 80's.<br /><br />It's a perfect example of The Pixies doing everything that make them so amazing: Black Francis' hilarious, random lyrics (\\"I wuz talkin' to peachy-peach about kissy-kiss!\\"), melodies that are both catchy and abrasive (River Euphrates, Cactus), squealing, atonal spirals of white guitar noise (Something Against You), innovative song dynamics (Gigantic) Steve Albini's stark, organic production ...and of course, \\"Where Is My Mind?\\", a song that belongs on every 'Greatst Songs Ever' list, right alongside Baba O'Reily, Stairway To Heaven, Free Bird, Hey Jude, and all the other established \\"classics\\". Listening to it is like watching a dam explode in slow-motion as the floodwaters kill everyone in their path. Defeated, poignant, and beautiful, this song alone is worth buying the album for.<br /><br />Now that The Pixies have reunited, the world has a second chance at seeing one of the greatest and most influential bands of the last 25 years. Don't be left out. Buy this stunning album now.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|It may be an oxymoron, but subtle power is prominant in this album. True, they do sing about love, but oftentimes the relationships they sing of, while being romantic, are really about the relationship between the singer and humanity. Symbolism and brilliant music make this album the first piece of great musical literature I have ever experienced.

0226264211|5.0|This book is extremely important! Together  with another classical von Hayek's \\"Road to Serfdom\\" and Amartya Sen's \\"Development as Freedom\\" it gives a basic argument for thinking about politics and economics.     In today's Russia both common people and scientists/politicians are involved in post-planned economy discourse. They look at the free markets as something chaotic, uncotrolled and therefore - bad. They are thinking in terms of state intervention and paternalism and that's a big mistake.    This book won't give concrete recipies for recovey in transitional or developing countries. But it will give a framework for thinking about resource allocation, taxation and spending, monetary policy and other stuff from the right point. A point where free society stands.

It pokes holes in the idea that all you need to do is be enthusiastic to succeed. Definitely worth your while reading the first few chapters before taking on a PhD in Science, as the supervisor and project you choose will have a large affect on your success!! Even if you have started your research work later chapters will give a good perspective on issues for your future in academia.

B00003CXTG|1.0|Have you ever wanted to commit suicide but could never come up with the courage?  Watch 'Pearl Harbor' and you'll have all the reason you'll ever need to blow your brains all over that cheap DaVinci print hanging on your bedroom wall.<br /><br />Directed by Michael Bay, mastermind of such craptasterpieces as 'Bad Boys' and 'Bad Boys 2' and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer of 'Kangaroo Jack' and 'Flashdance' fame comes this epically horrid World War II love story.  The lame story focuses on two losers(Ben 'Phantoms' Affleck and Josh 'Halloween H20' Harnett)who both are in love with a complete slut(Kate 'Van Helsing' Beckinsale).  They obviously shouldn't have fallen for this upscale prostitute but instead should have gathered all the native Hawaiians and stoned the crap out of her Mary Magdelene style.<br /><br />You would figure that a movie called 'Pearl Harbor' would actually be about the events that took place there.  Instead we get a pathetically acted, horribly scripted, and all around lame pile of fecal-tinged love story that overshadows the epic event that was the bombing of Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being too harsh, but if you like piss-poor and melodramatic excrement, then this film just might be your cup of tea.  Myself, I rate 'Pearl Harbor' slightly better than 'Dirty Dancing', but tied with 'Titanic' as the worst movie ever made.

B00005NGAL|5.0|I saw Cats performed in an stage setting years ago, and it has always been one of my favorite muscials.<br /><br />I loved the DVD version. True, it lacked the intimacy of the stage, but offers new dimensions including closeups and replay. I did not find the costumes \\"Halloweeny in garish close-up\\" an other reviewer did. I thought they were quite clever and well done. I also liked noticing the many cat-like gestures that I had not been able to see before (or at least remember seeing).<br /><br />My favorite part of musicals is the dancing and this musical's choreography was outstanding, showing a bit of everything from jazz dance, tap dance, modern dance, and ballet. I did enjoy the skin-tight costumes and somewhat \\"naughty\\" cat-like behavior, but I'm not sure I would say this is viewing material for kids.<br /><br />We watched the show first and then viewed the bonus DVD with the interviews. They really added to enjoyment of the show. I highly recommend viewing the interviews and watching the background information. Now we will watch the actual show again with a greater understanding of what it took to recreate.<br /><br />Seems like the Brits are taking a chance and converting their musicals to video/DVD. (I also have Oklahoma with Hugh Jackman). I wish more American producers would do that and get over the stuffy notion that the stage can't be reproduced, so why bother. We will view this DVD many many times. I can't say that about the stage version, since I rarely get to the city to see large-scale musicals.

B00009M6VJ|4.0|After first picking up \\"The Life of David Gale\\" and reading its description, I was a bit turned off. Yes, it appeared thrilling and, heck, it MIGHT even sport a good enough mystery to keep me from walking away. But the plot was not very well explained, and I was hessitant about spending money on a film I didn't know much about (I'd never even heard of it before!). Seeing as the store wasn't asking anywhere near full price, I decided to give it a shot. After all, I am usually fond of Spacey's work.  <br /> <br />I wasn't expecting much when I first started viewing, but the film wasn't too slow to pick up. I was a bit turned off by the scenes of excessive converse, but in the end it all was essential to the plotline. This movie turned out to be a great, dynamic mystery with an unpredictable and unforgettable conclusion. It will leave you with mixed emotions of awe, sympathy, admiration, and even outrage at our justice system. \\"The Life of David Gale\\" set out to make a statement about capital punishment, and boy, did it do just that.  <br /> <br />Performances by Spacey and Winslet were pretty good, and the only character who I found burdened the film was Laura Linney's, who was, quite bluntly, annoying.  <br /> <br /> <br />Most viewers may not be able to stomach this film more than once, but all in all it is definately worth seeing.  <br />
B000089RVX|4.0|The music is rockin' though there are a couple songs that slow things down.  The excellent vocals are what does it for me on this album, but the rest of the band is just as talented.  The songs are catchy & you will likely end up with one or more in your head.  I highly recommend this disk to any rock fan who also likes female vocalists.

B000068R1X|4.0|FIrst off this is a review of the 1995 remaster, not the 2002 one that I have heard alot of bad stuff about. SInce I got that out of the way here is how I break it down:<br /><br />Released in 1983, Bark at the Moon was a new beginning for Ozzy and the band. First off, the inclusion of new guitarist Jake E. Lee, who is actually pretty talented as a virtuoso; he isn't used to his full potential in this album as Ozz use of him is not very prominent on here as compared to the Ultimate Sin.<br /><br />Track Listing:<br /><br />1.Bark at the Moon: A true classic. The track is incredibly paced, there is the fast paced beginning then they have the slowed up story bridge in the middle. 10/10<br /><br />2.Youre No Different: Should have been a hit off of this album. The instruments on this track are amazing, especially the guitars and keyboards. The tone is just sooo awesome that the band I am with uses this on most of our material (which by the way is in no way lip-synched in any way). 10/10<br /><br />3.Now you see it(now you don't): A great intro, but then the rest just gets too friggn weird! This song turns from heavy almost Metallica-like intro to the FRIGGN ROCKY SONG!! THen if that isn't f#%$ed up enough, Ozzy using some kind of synthesizer starts singing \\"now you see it now you dont\\" which makes him sound like Misses Piggy! But wait, there's more! At the end the Ozz starts making these extremely weird grunting noises (I think it was \\"ooh aah, yeah! bodge! uhh, yeah yeah! in high pitch\\"). However, here is the good news: Bob Daisly and Jake E. Lee both have pretty good spots on this track, you should check em out. Even though this track is sooo friggn hilarious, the crappiness of it still forces me to give it at most a 5/10<br /><br />4.Rock n' Roll Rebel: A straight-out \\"that song has some balls\\" track. Even though this sounds too much like Priest (which isn't that bad, but this is Ozzy) it still has some great moments. Being a literary genius I appreciate Ozzy's use of 1984 terms such as the Ministry of Truth or the Ministry of War. I also like Jake E. Lee's solo spots on this one. 9/10<br /><br />5.Centre of Eternity: Hey guys, I think I've found where they got the intro idea for Halo! Just kiddn! I like how this song is paced, it has sort of a fast-paced Sabbath feel to it. I know this is Ozzy, but sometimes when they use a Sabbath like approach it works, and this is one of those tracks. 9/10<br /><br />6.So Tired: This ballard would be better all except that Ozzy made this too mellow. This one too feels like the Rocky song. It is saved by great lyrics and Jake E. Lee's guitar solo 2/3 of the way through. 7/10<br /><br />7.Slow Down: Another weird song. It is kind of odd that this song is called 'SLow Down' especially considering that it is 'moving way too fast'! It would be pretty good all except for it feels like a sequel to SATO, which is a great song but it really doesn't need a sequel: you know how sequels usually turn up anyway. It is great, I love the fast atmosphere of it, the guitar solo near the end is almost, like I said earlier, SATO! 8/10<br /><br />8.Waiting for Darkness: The second hit off of this record, it has a great dark feeling to it. If there is one thing I don't like about this track is Ozzy playing off the media's intrepertation of him as a psychotic satanic, even the title makes him sound like it. Besides that, I think that the guitar spots on here by Jake E. Lee are awesome. Truly deserved to be a hit. 9/10<br /><br />Bonus Track:<br />9.Spiders: WTF is the meaning of the song? SOme parts of it sound good but it is just too WTF for even the Ozz. I can see why it was left out. It kind of reminds me of Liar from NRFTW, all except for that one made sense and I was wondering why it wasn't on the album! 3/10: Not a single effing guitar spot!<br /><br />I would rate this as #10 on Ozzy's greatest albums list:<br />Ozzy's albums from best to worst:<br />1.Randy Rhoads Tribute<br />2.Diary of a Madman<br />3.Blizzard of Ozz<br />4.No Rest for the Wicked<br />5.No More Tears<br />6.The Ultimate Sin<br />7.Live and Loud<br />8.Just Say Ozzy<br />9.Speak of the Devil<br />10.Bark at the Moon<br />11.Ozzmosis<br />Anything after Ozzmosis isn't really worth adding on here.Speak of the Devil  10.Bark at the Moon  11.Ozzmosis  Anything after Ozzmosis isn't really worth adding on here.
B0009RCPY8|1.0|I'm a native French speaker and it hurts everytime I buy a DVD without the french language track; it hurts even more when a respectable studio as Columbia keeps a mistake on their package. The aspect ratio for Ghostbusters 1 is 2.35:1. Not 1.33:1 as the cardboard says.<br /><br />This being the 20th (actually, considering the movie was released in 1984, that would make it the 21st anniversary... can you spell late?) There are no more theatrical trailers on either DVDs and instead of a full-fledged boosted DVD edition with the special edition of Ghostbusters II we, ghostfans, thought we'd get, it was alas, no more than a dream. We have two RGB episodes (which are merely related to one or the other GB movie) on GBII's disc. The menus are, this time, static, no animation whatsoever and even worse, the GB II menu screen is STILL the one used for GB I. Is it my imagination, but I thought Dana Barrett's apartment building in GB II was NOT the Shandor building? The only thing remembering us that we're on the GBII DVD is when the Statue of Liberty passes by the screen instead of the Marshmallow Man. Can you spell lazy?<br /><br />Here's what we, ghostfans, wanted to see on the GBII DVD (maybe this way we can hope to get it on time for the 36th anniversary: Deleted scenes, making of featurettes, interviews, animated menus RELATED to the respective movies (as if you would use a chocolate factory for the E.T. DVD menus (see the link? Didn't think so)), before and after SPFX, Dan Aykroyd commentaries on BOTH movies, a GB documentary relating the difficulties of shooting BOTH movies, you know, having a 4 disc edition like the Indiana Jones and Star Wars... the way we're meant to be treated as fans who grew up waiting for such a thing to happen...<br /><br />Although the rest is pretty shameful, the transfer is spotless. It even gives me the feeling of being in that dark theater back in 1989 when I first saw GB II. Still, it's not much to bite on when fans are hungry for more. most studios have understood that if you want to sell many units, you have to include MORE bonuses (Rule #1 in finances: in order to make money, you have to spend money). And that is where the money for the bonuses went North.<br /><br />With a little help from real fans of the movies, they can actually get a nice edition done by the end of 2010... the 26th anniversary of Ghostbusters.<br /><br />Columbia, if you're reading this, contact me and I will gladly send you a photoshop DVD cover I made of the first GB movie (form scratch) that would finally give the series a much needed new look and something truly faithful to its source rather than the guys in front of the city with clouds and lots of colors or the GB logo over a slime spot. (and when you look behind the GB II DVD cover, you can see Peter Venkman, 1983... didn't GB II happened in 1989? or 1988?)<br /><br />After all these ups and downs, us ghost fans, will certainly be more cautious when we see the Ghostbusters logo on a media product.

B0000AOV85|5.0|As a musician, I just love this DVD series. You get great insights from your favorite musicians on recording. This DVD was especially interesting. They show lots of old film footage and they interview all of the band members. They showed some of the early synthesizers they used on the album and David Gilmore showed how he created the loop used in the song \\"On The Run\\". He also plays from the master tapes parts of his guitar solo's and shows how he layered them. They discussed the creative process of how the songs were written by Roger Waters. They demonstrate several of the songs on guitar during the interviews. \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" is by definition a classic album and will always be a great inspiration to musician's around the world.  <br /> <br />I wish they would do a Classic Album DVD of Edgar Winter's They Only Come Out At Night. Frankenstein with Rick Derringer on guitar and Edgar Winter playing an ARP 2600 Synthesizer. That would be cool to see.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|100% thug rock from the guts. I own no other album that affects me like this one and I own over 400. As soon as I hear Down On The Street or the opening of Loose I just immediately get sucked in and want to start kicking stuff. With this band the whole is definitely greater than it's parts. If you break everything down individually there is really nothing groundbreaking here. But when you put it all together watch out! Something happens. It's primitive, it's simple, but it kind of lulls you into a violent rock and roll trance. If you like driving, garage type rock then you MUST own this disc. This re-issue also sounds amazing. It punches you in the gut far more than the original CD. The alternate takes and things are pretty cool too so you can hear how some of the tunes evolved. What also kills me is the date this was released. Think back to that time and see if you can come up with anything even close to this.
B000001ELL|4.0|In the late 1970's, I was a young, starry-eyed, album buying, music fanatic.  Almost as a matter of course, I owned no fewer than five Kiss albums.  When Dynasty was released in 1979, I believed the bad press that this album received by almost everyone who wrote about it: \\"Kiss goes disco\\" and/or \\"Kiss sell out\\" and so on.  As a result, I skipped buying this offering till just a few months ago.  Pity me.  Let me take a tiny space here to dispel a common myth.  One disco track and bits and pieces of a few others is not a Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack make.  Dynasty is NOT a disco album. <br /> <br />So what were Kiss purists hearing in Dynasty that they were weary of?  Well, I will admit that Dynasty's sound is like no other `70's Kiss effort.  This is probably due to the heavier-handed album production done by Vini Poncia.  Poncia successfully smoothes over the usual Kiss' rough edges here and the results work.  Pervious Kiss' `70's output was quite raw.  Usually I would never criticize a rock album for being raw, but in Kiss' case the rawness caused the music to come off as anything from a little unfinished (as on their 1974 self-titled debut) to downright messy (as on that year's follow up \\"Hotter Than Hell\\").  A super job by not only Poncia, but also by our heroes Gene, Paul, Peter & Ace to be music biz savvy enough to allow Poncia to do his work.   <br /> <br />Back in 1979 (and now for that matter), Gene Simmons was my favorite member of Kiss.  I thought his was the coolest character (the Demon Man), and he was the best showman (spitting up blood and breathing out fire in concert).  With Dynasty, however, Paul Stanley proves what I think I've always known: that he has (by far) the best voice and writes the best songs of any band member.  Paul is this band's true star. <br /> <br />So what better place to start than with the leadoff track, Paul's \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\".  Though a top-ten single at the time, this was THE song that gave the album such a badname.  Is it a disco song?  Well, yes.  In Kiss' defense, however, just what were they doing with this track that Rod Stewart, Elton John, and even Santana and the Grateful Dead were not doing with rock/disco fusion in the late 1970's?  If I were old enough to go to dance clubs back in 1979, I would dance to this number WAY before something like \\"We Are Family\\".  Besides, this song does its share of rocking and it has aged (surprisingly) well.   <br /> <br />Paul then gives us a sneak preview of the type of pop-metal that he used so often during the 1980's with \\"Sure Know Something\\".  However, unlike Paul's 1980's pop-metal which was hit or (mostly) miss, this song is definitely a hit.  Ironically, it failed as this albums' second single, but the infectious melody is just hard to ignore!  Paul saves his best for last with \\"Magic Touch\\".  Armed with a completely rocking refrain, this song packs quite a wallop!  <br /> <br />Hot on the heels of his lead vocal debut (Love Gun's super \\"Shock Me\\") and solo single success (\\"Back In The New York Grove\\"), Ace Frehley contributes a whopping three songs to Dynasty.  The first of which is his cover of the Stones' \\"2000 Man\\".  Now usually I get a bit nervous when a band attempts to cover a song by `60's icons such as the Stones, Beatles or Doors.  For starters, who could actually sing that song better than Jagger, Lennon/McCartney or Morrison?  Well, Ace is no Mick Jagger here, but his guitar-heavy take on this number updates the 1967 song beautifully!  It ranks up there with Frehley's previously mentioned best work.  Unfortunately, Ace does not keep up the good work.  \\"Hard Times\\" with its juvenile, simpleton lyric (yes, simple even for Kiss' standards!) is Dynasty's only read dud.  The album closer, \\"Save Your Love\\" is not as bad as \\"Hard Times\\", but again weak songwriting might force you to use that forward button. <br /> <br />I know that I have leaped upon the Paul Stanley bandwagon.  However, I am not over-looking Gene Simmons' contributions for two major reasons.  As mentioned before, Simmons was then and is now the group's best showman, and when your band is Kiss, that's no small thing!  Secondly, Simmons' \\"X-Ray Eyes\\" and (moreover) \\"Charisma\\" are beastly!  \\"Charisma\\" is Dynasty's strongest track.  No disco here, just a ballsy lead vocal from Gene, hot lead guitar by Ace and a pounding drum and bass line that makes for some pretty great head banging!  Rock on Gene!   <br /> <br />Finally, with \\"Dirty Living\\", drummer Peter Criss offers his best effort since inventing the power ballad a few years earlier with \\"Beth\\" from Destroyer.  Again, Poncia's clean production does Peter quite well.  His past few efforts (i.e. \\"Baby Driver\\" from Rock And Roll Over) were just plain noisy.  The liner notes on the CD mention that besides this track, Peter contributes little to Dynasty.  Gene Simmons (in his book \\"Kiss and Make-Up\\") claims that this did not happen till the next record.  Whatever the case, this would be the last Peter Criss lead vocal we would hear on a Kiss record for almost 20 years.     <br /> <br />So forget what you may have heard about Dynasty Kiss fans!  If you do not own this CD, buy it now and thank me later!  <br />
B00005YW4H|5.0|This album is a work of art. The music and lyrics are simply beautiful. It is music that gets better with time.  Ms. Jones is an exceptional artist.
B000001GQT|5.0|Karajan and his beloved Berlin Philharmonic have been accused of \\"over indulgency\\" (for example, in the complete recordings of the Beethoven Symphonies, also available on Deutsche Gramaphon). However, the same cannot be said for this recording. Lustrous  strings, powerful brass and clear and concise woodwinds, all combined under the virtuosity of probably, at the time, the world's greatest conductor with the world's greatest orchestra ! <br /> <br />The opening of Zarathustra (made famous to the point of boring repetition from the movie 2001, a space odyssey), is easily susceptible to over emotional interpretation from the conductor; not so here.It is delivered with subtlety and combined with the awe inspiring power one would expect from the combination of the reputation of such a conductor and such an orchestra. <br /> <br />This almost \\"hands-off\\" interpretation of the work extends to the other Richard Strauss works also on the CD; Til Eulenspiegel, Don Juan and Salome, Dance of the Seven veils. For ANYONE interested in the works of this German composer, this CD is an absolute MUST!!! In over 35 years of listening to classical music, I would say this superbly re engineered recording from the original of 1974 represents the geatest interpretation ever made on vinyl (or in this case, digital)media of Strauss' best music.  <br /> <br />An absolutely wonderful CD demonstrating the technical AND musical skills of an orchestra that during the 1970's and 80's was regarded as the world's best, being conducted by a conductor who, for over 30 years, was regarded as the world's best!
B00006J9OT|5.0|\\"Live\\" albums kind of feels like a cheapened concert experience (Why go for that when you can get the real thing?). But I really enjoyed this album. Her voice sounds rich and the instrumentations are really done well. Considering this was my first real listen to a Diana Krall album (a live one at that), I was very impressed. Most of the songs I've already heard other versions of, but Krall brings a fresh approach that never bored me. I will check out her other albums.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|Leone's masterpiece is well worth a viewing not only to see a classic piece of western lore of good versus evil but also to be transported to a time when analysis of the need to fight the corruption bred by wealth and power was an acceptable plot line. It was striking to see this from the perspective of post 9-11 America.   Movie buffs will enjoy the movie as cinema and the additional disc is chock full of goodies.  For all this package offered this was a great buy and all of these factors helped make my viewing of Once Upon a Time in the West a truly wonderful experiecne.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Don't get me wrong, Mezmerize isn't a bad album. But it's nowhere near as good as SOAD's previous 3 albums. They're a solid band so I was kind of disappointed the first time I heard B.Y.O.B. The lyrics on this song were okay but the music's not really their style. But since I've always been a big SOAD fan I decided to buy Mezmerize and listen to it for myself.     I'll admit that it turned out to be an okay CD, but it really wasn't much better than I thougt it might be. I guess most of the songs were weren't weren't all that bad, but they definitely weren't great either. To be honest, there's only one song I really liked on this album; \\"Question\\". The lyrics are good and I'm pretty sure this is the first song they've ever used an acoustic guitar on, so it really made it stand out.     There's one thing that really bothered me about this album though. Why is Daron Malakian the lead singer all of a sudden? Last thing I knew, Serj was the lead singer. I mean, Daron's a good songwriter and everything, but he really needs to stick at what he does best; guitar and back-up vocals.     At any rate, I honestly think SOAD took a big step in the wrong direction with Mezmerize. So, before you even consider buying this album, do yourself a favor and get a CD of theirs that isn't just okay, a CD that actually has some true quality music.

1400032717|4.0|This is a very enjoyable read, with a fresh perspective from a unique narrator.  I worried at the outset that the first-person voice of the autistic narrator might become too precious or oppressive, but I needn't have worried.  Hadden deftly handles the challenge he set for himself in presenting a consistent, authentic voice which, in light of the narrator's inability to understand jokes or interpret feelings, is ironically funny, insightful, and empathetic.  I also think this book will appeal to, and is appropriate for, young adult readers.  I have recommended it to my 13-year-old son, and I think it will provide a great foundation for a discussion with him about human relationships, loyalty, betrayal, our efforts to understand each other, the challenges we set for ourselves and, of course, the novel form itself.
B000025U2V|5.0|I am very fond of \\"Simply Red\\", and the content of this CD is superb classic Simply Red at Mick Hucknall's finest. I recommend this to everyone that is a Simply Red fan, and if you are not familar with Simply Red, and you like crooners and jazz pop rock, you need to try this CD.  It is just excellent! <br />This is the first time that I have purchased a used CD.  It arrived in horrible condition.  It is filthy and I have gotten a lesson in just how nasty some people live.  I am very fond of Simply Red, and for anyone to abuse one of Mick Hucknall's CDs is sad to me.
B0006957SA|5.0|If I Should Fall from Grace With God~ The Pogues is a very nice \\"folk-rock\\" album with nicely written lyrics, and vocals that sound rough and a bit uncouth but it just for the this kind of music. One can imagine seeing the singer in an Irish Bar with his mates drinking, playing music, and having a grand time. I love the book-let and the photos, font and the lay-out for it is simply put it grand. I love the clarity of the cover photo and the rest of the photos are also well done. Highly recommended indeed.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Life before College Dropout was dead and im saying this cuz its true all the social concious of hip-hop was not there all we heard was the same old stuff booty,booty, rims spinning and pinky rings gleaming. Who cares ok them rims was tired after shaq showed them to the world on MTV. Kanye made hip-hop that dudes like me me can relate to everyone aient a thug and everyone dont sell crack to make a living. Kanye West resurected true instruments in hip-hop again and that good feeling we used to get when we heard it. He just has a good ear for music and when it was time for him to come out with his own music he did just that. This album was tight from the begging to end and I'm still rocking it.  Dont let the brain washed blueprint hip-hop(sex, clubing, drugs and money=hits) heads stop you from getting this album if you love real hip-hop then pick this cd up.

0140123083|4.0|On the outside of it war is the most insane of events.  As a theater of human baseness it has no equal; beginning with instinct, and moving on up through decency, honor and love, war demands the renunciation of every more humanity has struggled through centuries to weave into the permanent fabric of civilization.  At the end , it leaves nothing but shredded bodies, traumatized psyches, and the promise of other, more horrific wars in the future to slake mankind's evil compulsions. <br /> <br />Would that it were so simple.  Pat Barker's \\"Regeneration\\" trilogy, an anti-war blend of obscure history and eloquent fiction, presents a different picture, one that articulates a side of war more frightening than the accepted version of brutal violence and noble self sacrifice.  War, more than just a senseless cacaphony of carnage, can be coldy rational--a laboratory, as it were, for experiments on human capability. <br /> <br />Barker weaves her story around a long forgotten true historical personality named Siegfried Sassoon, a decorated officer who in 1917 was sent to an asylum for the crime of denouncing the Great War as a senseless staging of slaughter nightmares.  His confinement under the supervision of Dr. William Rivers leads doctor and patient into a dialog filled with critical insights into the nature of logic, sanity, and the human longing for connection.  In the process Dr. Rivers finds himself unravelling in a malestrom of unanswerable questions about everything he's deemed valuable.  Who is running this asylum? <br /> <br />Fact or fiction, criminal or noble, hero or coward?  Poor Dr. Rivers obsesses over these questions even while Siegfried, the ostensible hysteric, continues on his one man mission, comfortable in his skin, certain in his convictions, an intimate friend of the truth.  In the process several other characters weave in and out of the story, each with his own piercing perspective on cruelty and the high cost of violence.  They are each of them, invarious and demented ways, the subjects of experiments, the goal of which is to discover something new in the forward thrust of existence.   <br /> <br />Barker's title, \\"Regeneration\\", refers to the advances medical science attempted during this period in reattaching nerve endings and rendering wounded men amubulatory and sensate again.  But what will they feel?  As people play their games and play God, for the vaguest, most obscure of selfish reasons, can there be any outcome from their human tinkering but misery and alienation?  <br /> <br />In this saga Barker, whose writing style illuminates her characters' internal wars with beautiful shades of grey and splashes of red, implies that Siegfried has it figured out.  We all want to know more about the answers he's discovered.  But most, like this reader, will find themselves tripping, with Dr. Rivers, through a swamp of uncertainty into the quicksand of despair into which all war descends.
6304696566|5.0|John Ford seemed to be able to get the most out of John Wayne and this film really shows just how good an actor Wayne could be.  This is the epic western tale of survival in a hostile land.  John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, an outsider, who comes back to his brother's ranch several years after the Civil War.  Ethan was on the 'lost cause' side of the conflict.  As a Confederate war veteran, he tries to find his place once again in this reconstruction phase of his life...he has been lost and wandering for several years. Once back home with his brother, he starts to slowly unwind.  This conflicted character soon find himself with Marty (Jeff Hunter), and the Texas Rangers..lead by Ward Bond..chasing stolen cattle only to find themselves fooled by the Commache..(who are on a raiding party).  Upon returning to the ranch, Commaches have massacred the brother, wife and stolen Lucy and Debbie..the two daughters.  This leads to the downs and ups of them searching all over the territory for the stolen daughters.<br /><br />Watch this film for the cinematography as well as the fine acting by John Wayne.  As the movie opens the film starts inside the cabin home and as the door opens we are sweeped into the Monument Valley vistas.  All throughout the film, Ford used the landscape as another actor.  When the movie closes, the camera pulls back into the same cabin view, just in reverse.  With everyone going back to loved ones, the door closes leaving Ethan..much as he started...outside the door and homeless...clutching just himself.<br /><br />This is a great movie especially for those who want to learn more about the art and technique of movie making.  Well worth adding to any collection.

0553573403|4.0|There are many different charecters in this book.  My favorite is not the most witty or the strongest or even the most adaptable but I like him anyway.  He is Ned Stark some would say he has an overdeveloped sense of honor.  I think Martin put him in the book not only because he was a good charecter but also so that the reader could realize what a hard time the traditional fantasy charecter would have in his world.<br /><br />Think about it, Ned is the only charecter in this universe that is remotly close to all the other charecters in all those other traditional fantasy books.<br /><br />While very few of the charecters in this serise are wholly good or wholly evil they always seem to have one flaw or another that is holding them back.  The Starks the nominal \\"good guys\\" are proud and honorable but are rather stuck up about it all.<br /><br />The Lnnisters are not evil just single minded and will do whatever it takes to win.  They also do not trust the ability of the \\"small folk\\" to make decisions for themselves.  This is of course backed up with an iron will and a very large army.  I think that if any of the family was taken to the Wheel of Time Universe they would take it over in a matter of weeks.<br /><br />Overall-I have gone on too long already.  The book is a different approach even if it is still fantasy.  I don't know about any of the rest of you but I have had it up to my ears with books that go exactly as you expect them to.  Heck, read the books for the comedy and the wordplay if nothing else.

6305882592|5.0|This black comedy stars Ruth Gordon as an eccentric old lady..'When I am an Old Woman, I shall wear Purple'.  She borrows, 'steals' other's cars, attends funerals of unknown people, rescues 'asthmatic' trees and saves Harold.  Harold, Bud Cort, is a young man in search of his place in the big wide world.  He is at odds with his mother and really is adrift..without any real direction.  For attention and to rattle his mother, he fakes suicides and attends funerals.  There he meets Maude and she starts to bring him out of the his shell...she helps him learn to sing his own song.  This is a theme that is played upon as she gives harold the banjo.  His mother tries to get him to figure out what he wants by having him talk with a psychiatrist, (notice how he and harold wear the same clothes), his Uncle..the war veteran..and by getting him married off.<br /><br />This movie has some genuine funny moments.  The scene of his mother filling out the computer dating questionarie is hillarious.  When he fakes setting himself on fire and his date goes into hysterics..running off.  He faces the camera with that wry smirk..his mother looking at him with furrowed brow..and he turns to see her expression and quickly loses that smirk..is just fine acting and an interesting film technique.  The part where Maude sees the sick tree and turns quickly and parks on the sidewalk.. with car running and doors open..to try to move the tree and returns to the car as the three policeman are checking out the situation.  She ask the officer if the car over there is parked right. He replies yes..as the officers look at each other laughingly.  Harold and Maude steal the Mach 1 and race around the corner..squeeling tires not even stopping.  The expression on the waving policeman's face is priceless.<br /><br />There are just way too many really..fall out of the chair..funny parts in this movie to mention.  With a great Cat Stevens' score, this is one of the best 'Black Comedies' available.<br />This cult film also has so many really great lines of dialogue...  Harold to Maude \\"I love you! Maude replys \\"Oh! That's wonderful, Harold Go..and love some more.\\" Maude talking to Harold about life, \\"Play as well as you can otherwise you got nothing to talk about in the locker room\\"...just to name a few.so many really great lines of dialogue...   Harold to Maude \\"I love you! Maude replys \\"Oh! That's wonderful, Harold Go..and love some more.\\" Maude talking to Harold about life, \\"Play as well as you can otherwise you got nothing to talk about in the locker room\\"...just to name a few.

B0000640VO|2.0|I'm sorry, but I just don't get what a lot of the people are on about in their reviews of this movie. I'm into romantic movies - I am a hopeless romantic, etc, but this movie didn't do a THING for me. The lead actress is cute, yes, and there are a few moderately cute bits here and there, but romantic? NO. <br /> <br />It's certainly not the type of movie you feel OK about sitting down and watching with your parents (as I tried to do). <br />SOme nasty lines my mother hated, (\\"he's like that because his father peed in his mother\\").  <br /> <br />Yes, Amelie becomes a bit of a matchmaker in one storyline, but I don't think the result of the match (a man and a woman have sex in a toilet loud enough to make all the dishes jump on the shelves of the cafe) is romantic - at all. <br /> <br />or Amelie sitting on the roof seeing how many orgasms she can hear (fifteen, as it turns out). <br /> <br />In short, this movie didn't produce ANY feel-good emotion in me at all. If you're after something like Sleepless in Seattle, you're going to be very disappointed. Even the love-story in Spider-Man 2 (which I watched with my folks) was HEAPS more romantic than this rubbish. <br /> <br />Is it romantic to meet up with a guy you were trying to meet through and whole film and have sex with him staright away basically without having said 2 words thoughout the film? I didn't think so, and neither did my folks.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I found Firefly on DVD in early 2004 because I was a fan of other Joss Whedon work.  Having never seen an episode, I took the $40 chance that it might be silly and empty.  That could not be farther from the truth.  I thoroughly enjoyed every single episode of this unique TV show. <br /> <br />Plenty of other reviewers have described the plot of the show, so I won't bother.  What I will say is that I was affected enough by the interactions and comaradery of the characters that I was very sad when I finished watching the episodes, realizing there will never be any more thanks to the network television system.  These are very human characters who you will deeply miss once you have completed the series.  It is a show that mass TV audiences will be confused and alienated by because it is so sophisticated and complex, both in terms of cinematic qualities and plot.  If you are unwilling to commit to TV series, then Firefly is most likely not for you. <br /> <br />In addition to terrific production values and an engaging visual style, the show boasts trademark Joss Whedon dialogue that, again, will not be understood by the attention-deficit MTV generation raised on bodily-function jokes that require no thought to enjoy. <br /> <br />The sum of all these parts, though, is a very unique attitude that the show has that immensely appeals to me.  Witty vigilantes on the run, each with layered psyches and problems, set against the backdrop of  the American West 500 years in the future.  Despite loving certain seasons of Whedon's previous TV work, I believe Firefly is his greatest creation, and something that will be difficult to do justice to when the big-screen version \\"Serenity\\" appears later this month.  That said, if you intend to see \\"Serenity,\\" there is no doubt your enjoyment of the movie will be enhanced by viewing this short-lived series first.

B00005JODA|2.0|This movie has an good storyline, and excellent acting. I'll leave it to the other reviews to expand on this. <br /> <br />But, honestly, it was ruined by the non-stop shaky, jerky camerawork. It was probably meant to enhance the feeling of tenseness, which I guess it did for 10 minutes or so. But it pretty quickly got old, and by the time we had finished TWO HOURS of this, I had a headache and my wife had actually developed motion sickness to the point of nausea. <br /> <br />I'd also have to say that this camerawork (I can't actually call it cinematography) failed on other levels, too. Even during the parts where I wasn't made physically uncomfortable by it, I was never able to forget that I was watching a movie. Every time the camera swung around or the picture leaned, or whatever, I was pulled out of the story - I was never able to lose myself and get really involved. <br /> <br />All the great acting, interesting storyline, social awareness, etc. in this movie is simply lost in the awful filming. <br />

A couple months later into the tour shows the honing of the YES we've all come to love over the years. Including the Very Special Acoustic Set this 2 DVD set is well worth it! <br />What a special  treat to have seen them over 15 times live since 1971  and now with Dolby 5.1 sound quality I can crank up the volume to  simulate a Live YES Concert anytime I want!!! YES, YES!!, YES, YES!! Let's hope for more of the same in the future. ENJOY!!!

B0009VRHLK|1.0|VG is in a bar with a few friends. After sufficient lubrication, each is outdoing the other with outrageous stories about sexual conquests. A bet is made. The next time they get together, whoever has the best true story about getting laid wins. Proof is required. Thus, \\"The Brown Bunny.\\" This is a 3 minute b.j. surrounded by 90 minutes of cinematic doodling. What dialogue there is is obviously ad-libbed (badly). In the climactic scene, VG sounds like a wounded animal, whining and whimpering incoherently and inaudibly. The viewer is left to wonder, what was CS thinking when she agreed to service VG orally? No doubt VG convinced her it was critical to the story. Well, murder was critical to \\"The Godfather\\", but nobody was actually killed in order to make it more realistic. CS is naive and stupid and VG is scum, but he did win the bet.
B000059XUP|5.0|The Crow City Of Angels came out in 1996. I remember, I was in third grade, and I saw the previews for this movie, my goodness, I REALLY wanted to see it. I personally thought it looked amazing. Then I heard that there was a movie called The Crow which stared Brandon Lee. Most people said The Crow was an amazing movie, but when The Crow City Of Angels came out, most people said this was an awful movie.  <br /> <br />When I was in grade 5, I watched The Crow, and man, I LOVED it. In grade 9 I watched The Crow: Salvation, and Loved it. Also in grade 9 I watched The Crow: City Of Angels... I LOVED IT. I watched The Crow: City Of Angels MORE than any other Crow movie out there. Probably because the concept was better with Romance.  <br /> <br />People complain about how crappy it was because it's not as good as the first, but however FEW PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT WASN'T EVEN MEANT TO REPLACE THE FIRST. It was meant to give Crow fans a new chapter.  <br /> <br />So what if it's not the first Crow movie, NO CROW movie will ever live up to the first, Nor Salvation, nor Wicked Prayer. Sure, It's not as strong as the Crow was, but guess what, it's a TOTALLY different movie.  <br /> <br />The acting of The Crow: City Of Angels NEEDED to be worked on, because The acting isn't exactly the best. I forgive that though, because if NOT for Mia Kirshner and Iggy Pop, the movie probably would have been A LOT worse. Vincent Perez has a VERY good look as The Crow, but his acting yet, was NOT good, and also because of his swedish accent. <br /> <br />The story of The Crow: City Of Angels was in my opinion better than the first, because of Sarah; She falls in love with her past (her past meaning Ashe Corvin coming from the dead). Unfortunatly, they DIDN'T show the romantic scenes as people say the Uncut version did. If you watch the trailer for The Crow: City Of Angels, you can catch a glimpse of Sarah and Ashe kiss which is good.  <br /> <br />I would say the movie focused more on Sarah and Ashe than on the adversaries that Ashe has to confront, which is why I loved it.  <br /> <br />I noticed that people like the movie more NOW than when it first came out, probably because it got more tame over the years.  <br /> <br />OVERALL: FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THE CROW CITY OF ANGELS, if you want to watch it and compare it to the first, you probably won't like it, but if you respect it as for what it is; A DIFFERENT MOVIE THAN THE FIRST, It's good on its own. It STANDS alone. DONT COMPARE IT TO THE FIRST BECAUSE IT'S NOTHING LIKE IT AND IT'S NOWHERE NEAR THE FIRST!
B000B5XOSO|1.0|I dont know how people can watch this movie and call it a good sequel. The movie is dreadful, and the Penguin is the worst villian in the Batman series. Burgess Meredith played Penguin in the orignal series, and is the only man who can play Penguin. This movie is too long, and its basically 2 hours of talking and about 20 minutes of action that is thrown in here and there. Save your money and buy the regular dvd with no speical features, this movie is not worth rebuying for speical features.
0156027321|3.0|I was walking through my local bookstore when I happened upon this book. I read the back and instantly became intrigued. I started reading it and found its start to be a little slow. I pressed on waiting for things to pick up and sure enough, they did. It is obvious throughout the book that Pi survives his ordeal but even though, I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. All the way through I was kept captivated but in the end all there was was disappointment. I liked the plot but I don't like how it leaves the uncertainty of what really happened. I think it would have been better if it just stayed simple but I am young and naive. My opinion is that only someone good at reading in between the lines would like this book.
B000002H2H|4.0|I really like this album, and I have figured out Metallicas top 3 albums, they are as follows: 1 - ...And Justice for All; 2 - Kill 'em All; and 3 - Ride the Lightning. Most Metallifans believe that Master and Ride are their best, but I think Justice blows both out of the water. With that said, Ride is still an essential for any metal fan; as it has classic songs like 'Fight Fire with Fire', title track, 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', and 'Fade to Black'. James Hetfields vocals arent as insane as they were on Kill, but they are more of an Ozzy Osbourne type of sound and his lyrics are much more sophisticated. Lars' Ulrich does a decent job here, and provides a fitting rythem section. Cliff Lee Burton is the master of bass, as we all know, and here he has great rythems. Kirk Hammett does all right here, I believe his best work is in Justice, although his Ride work is far superior than his Master work. Right, song ratin' time. <br /> <br />1 - Fight Fire with Fire: This is a very good opener with very few flaws. I like the riff and solo here, but Lars' drumming could have been more creative, as I've heard better of him (as well as far worse). The vocals are angry, keep in mind this was made when Hetfield had his brain. Overall: 9/10 <br /> <br />2 - Ride the Lightning: Tied with track 8 as the best song on the album. I like the verse riff a lot, and the angry vocals from Hetfield go great with the instruments. The Mustaine solo and the solo riff in the middle is the best part of the song. And Lars' drumming here is some of his best. Overall: 11/10 <br /> <br />3 - For Whom the Bell Tolls: After the title track and track 8, this is the one to hear. The riff may be very simple and solos may be jokes, but the songwriting from Hetfield and Burton...and everyone is PHENOMENAL! James' lyrics, as well as vocals', demonstrate some his best work, which in my opinion, can only be matched by 'One'. Overall: 10/10 <br /> <br />4 - Fade to Black: Somewhat overrated, as it isn't the best song on the album, but its still a memorable song that most metal fans will listen to quite often. The wordless chorus I found very creative, as I think the band saw that words cant describe the pain of taking ones own life. The end solo is true Hsammett and demonstrates his potential, and this is also one of the two non-Justice songs where Kirk goes beyond the power chord. Overall: almost 10/10 <br /> <br />5 - Trapped Under Ice: This song has short, blazing solos before each verse, but it sounds as if the band made this song in ten minutes. I really wish Hetfield actually tried on this song...*sigh*. Overall: 7/10 <br /> <br />6 - Escape: This is worse than track 5. Read what I wrote for Trapped again, but imagine it twice as bad. Overall: 4/10 <br /> <br />7 - Creeping Death: Phew, a breath of fresh air. This song is incredibly catchy, and has a pretty good solo in there too. The riff is very creative and the lyrics are about the Egyptian Plague. Overall: 9/10 <br /> <br />8 - The Call of Ktulu: The guitar in this song is amazing, and this alone has influenced my instrumental guitar work far beyond any other song. The solo is crazy, and Lars' lashes back with great drumming. The backround riff is really cool, it actually sounds very haunting. Being 9 minutes long, there are multiple riffs, and it is a very interesting song. Overall: 11/10 <br /> <br />Yeah, uh, besides track 6 this is a great album and if you dont have it (if you're a metal fan) then get it now!
B000069CWE|5.0|Linkin Park - Reanimation <br />Review By: Mike P <br /> <br /> Reanimation is a remix of the 2000 blockbuster release \\"Hybrid Theory.\\"  The rock band reworks the tracks from the previous album into a rock/hip-hop collaboration with help from stars across the industry, including Jonathan Davis from Korn, Kutmasta Kurt, and The X-Ecutioners.   <br /> <br /> This CD gives fans of not only rock but also hip-hop a chance to get a taste of what each genre has to offer.  Although the group uses them, instruments are not what make their music so addictive.  They put much thought and time into their beats and come up with brilliant tunes.  Also, their beats don't always repeat as the song goes on.  Sometimes, the beat is ever-changing and you will never hear the same rhythm twice.                           What makes this CD different from other remake-type albums is that they actually rename their songs using the names from the previous album, and modifying them.  For example, the hit song \\"Papercut,\\" is renamed \\"PPr:Kut.\\"  This is one example of their originality and creativity. <br />  <br /> This album chops up each song with new lyrics from the guest artists, which makes for more than just a remix.  You get a new perspective from artists other that just the title group, and this helps reinterpret the old and new album.  This is a promising album which the group shows off not only its musical talent, but also its creativity and originality. <br /> <br />
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is truly a charming CD! This is as equally nice as his first two recordings. It starts off with the very theme of this gem of an album, \\"Feeling Good.\\" Every listener will feel good hearing all the songs delightfully rendered by Michael Bubl&eacute; in this wonderful recording produced by David Foster, Tommy LiPuma and Humberto Gatica.  The second track is a swingy take of George and Ira Gershwin's \\"A Foggy Day (In London Town).\\" Followed by a song popularized by Ray Charles \\"You Don't Know Me\\" and that so splendid duet version of \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\" with Nelly Furtado, a beautiful Bossa Nova arrangement by David Foster and Jorge Calandrelli.<br /><br />The other highlights are his heartfelt renditions of Stevie Wonder-penned-song \\"You And I,\\" Cole Porter's classic \\"I've Got You Under My Skin,\\" Campbell/Connely/Woods' \\"Try A Little Tenderness,\\" a song that speaks of a 'tender loving care' treatment . . . \\"It's not just sentimental, she has her grief and her care, but a word so soft and gentle makes it easier to bear. . . and when she's weary, try a little tenderness.\\"<br /><br />Chris Botti, a trumpeter-extraordinaire contributed his talent in \\"Song For You,\\" a Leon Russell composition. \\"Save The Last Dance For Me\\" is also one remarkable track with its nice arrangement.<br /><br />My absolute all-time favorite in this collection of fabulous songs aside from \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\" is his superb interpretation of Mack Gordon and Harry Warren's ever-charming song, \\"The More I See You.\\" The jazzy arrangement was done by John Clayton, Jr.<br /><br />\\"As years go by<br />I know the only one for me<br />can only be you<br />My arms won't free you<br />And my heart won't try.\\"<br /><br />I truly enjoyed listening to this wonderful CD. You will, too!

0393057658|5.0|Some investors want the most glamorous growth stocks, no matter what the price. Likewise, some baseball coaches and managers are willing to \\"pay up\\" for an Alex Rodriguez or Jason Giambi. And if you are fortunate enough to head up the New York Yankees, you can.    Others have to do it differently or not at all, according to \\"Moneyball.\\" Chief among these are Billy Beane, who manages to take his Oakland A's to the play-offs year after year, despite being the general manager of the second most impoverished team in baseball. How does he do it?    His central insight is that some baseball skills are much more valuable than others. A related insight is that other managers overpay for less essential skills such as fielding, stealing bases, and \\"legging out\\" singles into doubles. Hitting is genuinely important, but everyone knows that. What others generally overlook is the importance of walks. A walk is as good as a single, yet most managers pay for batting averages, not on base percentages (OBPs, or hits plus walks divided by plate appearances), even though statistical analysis shows that the latter ratio correlates much better with runs and wins. Hence the trick is to hire low-paid hitters with mediocre batting averages and other perceived deficits, who are good at drawing walks, and thus get high OBPs through the \\"back door.\\"    Beane takes a similar approach to pitching. To him, a pitcher's main job is to \\"deceive\\" good batters, not overpower them with fastballs. So he hires Jim Mecir, who has a club foot and a \\"slow\\" pitch, with spins and angles that most hitters can't handle. Warren Buffett was similarly good at investing in companies with good \\"franchises,\\" and stock prices beaten down by serious, but not \\"career-limiting,\\" problems such as American Express, GEICO, and even Coca-cola.    The book's main fault is that it overdraws Beane's prowess in order to capture the reader's attention. Some of the players acquired by the A's in 2002 didn't do so well in retrospect, and some of the players rejected by Oakland did fine elsewhere. But Beane and his staff have done enough right to make the team a perennial contender--and on a tight budget at that.
0140120416|5.0|My copy of the New Penguin Russian Course is rather battered after 18 months of near constant use. It's been to Russia with me where it sat by my side in Russian classes. I still use it for reference purposes. The reason for this is that Nicholas J. Brown explains Russian grammar better than any other author I have come across.  <br /> <br />The course is designed for the complete beginner. It starts with the Russian alphabet and covers all the major points of grammar. Quickly I realised that learning the alphabet is one of the easier tasks, certainly compared with learning the cases and the verbs. Brown leads the reader gradually through the complexities and provides lots of exercises with answers. Doing these exercises is the key to progress. With reasonably hard work it took me about three months to finish the book. At which point I could, with some difficulty, read a short story by Chekhov.  <br /> <br />It's important to realise what this book does not do. It does not teach you to speak or listen. Although Brown tries to give the reader an idea of how Russian sounds, there is no substitute for actually hearing these sounds and trying to reproduce them. To gain any sort of fluency it is necessary to practice speaking and listening. Fortunately, although it can at times be quite difficult to pronounce Russian, the pronunciation, unlike English, is fairly regular and predictable. What Brown's book does really well is to provide the learner with a solid foundation, for without a good grasp of Russian grammar you will not be able to hold even a simple conversation no matter how good your pronunciation. I really enjoyed working through this course. Brown's book makes learning difficult points of grammar interesting and satisfying. It made me want to continue my studies rather than give up baffled. I still have a long way to go before I can claim to speak Russian well, but I will always be grateful to this book for providing me with such a good start.  <br />

B0000C9ZSV|5.0|This was my first Hendrix album. I bought it because my dad said that a Hendrix live album would work better than Greatest Hits, and I love this!<br /><br />The first song, not counting the intro, is Pass it On, one of the best performances of the show, he tears through that thing! Next things mellow out a LOT for Hey Baby (New Rising Sun), another favorite of mine. Lover Man isn't really all that good, but I do like the energy. Stone Free is better than the original, but I don't see what the big deal about it is.<br /><br />The show-stealer has to be Hey Joe, which he sings in a slower, bluesy tempo and throws in a lot more emotion than the original. I Don't Live Today is another example of how he improves upon his studio work. Live Today was probably my least favorite tune on Are You Experienced, and this version isn't perfect, but it's better.<br /><br />Next up is Machine Gun, a long, antiwar tune that definetly doesn't feel like it extends eleven minutes. I love the bassline, too. After this, we've got a great rendition of Foxey Lady, one of Are You Experienced's highlights. My least favorite performance, Star Spangled Banner, follows. I don't think it's unpatriotic, I just find it annoying. Thankfully, we recover with a blazing reduex of Purple Haze. He also extends Voodoo Child (Slight Return) to nearly eleven minutes AND throws in a new section, \\"We've got to keep on groovin'...\\" that I absolutely love, not to mention a mind-blowing guitar solo.<br /><br />An awesome album.
B000AADYRQ|2.0|While I bought (and enjoyed) the Postal Service CD, I thought that it might serve as an outlet for some of the (more sensitive) leanings of our foo'ball hero Mr. Gibbard.  Unfortunately, the more garage-band, guitar-based DCFC stuff (Hindsight, Song for Kelly Huckaby, Champagne From a Paper Cup) is completely missing from this album.  It's an emo trainwreck, and while I enjoy a weepie just as much as the next self-assured heterosexual male, I gotta say, the DCFC boys have done better.
B00092ZL80|5.0|This is a hugely fantastic music dvd.....the best I have seen.  There is so much music from both groups that it is so worth the money.  Whoever thought of bringing these two groups together both for separate performances and JOINT performances of each other's hits was a genious.  By this DVD.  You will not regret it one bit. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|I guess this review isn't needed. This CD is incredibly good and lots of people agree. But anyway- I'll say it's one of those very rare recordings in which you like ALL songs... and can't even decide which is the best... May sound cheesy, but its true. Hey, I got it now, the best one is \\"A Message\\"! No, actually it's \\"The Hardest Part\\", or is it \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\"??
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't know why this was canned after the first season, it's definately Joss Whedon's best!  The actors are great and really make their characters beleivable. <br /> <br />I laughed, I cried....well you know the rest.

B0002V7O3I|5.0|1985 has brought into this world the best classics known to man. Gremlins, Gremlins II and Troll. Explorers is only one of many of those few classics. This really really really needs a sequel as it left us on a cliff hanger of questions. What happened to Neek and Wac? Why did the aliens pick humans? Why did they watch television? And why did the officer say he had the exact same dreams that the kids(Darren, Wolfgang and Ben)had? I really think this needs a sequel as it had the dream at the end saying a sequel was in the makings.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Some movies are pigeon-holed as \\"Chick-flicks.\\" Some movies are \\"Guy-flicks.\\" This is about as Guy-flick as you can get! With the unusual coloring and camera angles it is almost as if the comic book itself started moving and telling its story.But this is no Captain Marvel or Archies, this is the gritty, ultra-violent world of Sin City. <br />Some of the lines are so cheesy that you feel slapped in the face with a slice of swiss, but it fits in this off-kilter, out of control movie. <br />Take a Tarantino flick, mix in some Fellini, a little Tim Burton on the side, toss in a healthy crop of sexy women and lots of guns and Tadaaaa, you have this movie. <br />I went to see this movie with my wife and another couple. We ended up with four separate reactions. My wife thought it was a waste of time, the other wife didn't like it but could see why others would. My friend said he thought it was pretty good. I had to digest the movie for a while before I came to the conclusion that this is a darn good movie and is a guilty pleasure to watch. Too violent? Yup. Too much skin? Yup. Unrealistic? Yup. Gonna watch it over and over again? Yup, when the wife isn't around.

B0009QTS1M|4.0|GLADIATOR Extended Edition (DreamWorks, $40) is another historical epic that's getting an ambitious new DVD release.<br /><br />Already among the top 15 best-selling DVDs, equally popular among men and women, the new three-disc edition features 17 minutes of previously unseen material and a very entertaining and revealing commentary with director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe, a first for the latter.<br /><br />The fresh extras on the additional discs are extremely well done and very watchable. The highlight is the lengthy, 200 minute, richly detailed documentary Strength and Honor: Creating the World of Gladiator that focuses on the films evolving screenplay structure, production and remarkable visuals - battles, props and weapons, costumes, practical and digital sets, etc.  I was emotionally touched by the featurette on Oliver Reed, his unexpected death during production and how the film was finished using previously recorded elements that included Reed's image or his singular voice.<br /><br />The glory that was Rome and the final homeward journey of a wronged but honorable pagan seeking, finally, only his family is magnificently portrayed.  DreamWorks has set the bar high with this DVD Special Edition.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Review: Kanye West, The College Dropout <br /> <br /> Kanye West burst back on to the Hip-Hop scene, with the release of his debut album, The College Dropout. Partially recorded after his nearly fatal car accident, this rapper from Chicago leaves us no doubt that the Roc-A-Fella label will still thrive even with the retirement of its figurehead Jay-z. The album is filled with many songs that not only catch you with their beats and lyrics, but with the messages you can read between the lines of the songs. <br /> Kanye West was a long time producer for many major stars and now looks to become one himself with his first album. One song on the album, Through The Wire, was recorded while Kanye still had his jaw wired shut after his accident that nearly claimed his life. This song has many positive messages for anyone who may happen to listen to it. At one point in the song the lyrics read, \\"Thank God I wasn't too cool for the safe belt.\\" This message will have a very positive influence on anyone who will listen, because they will see a very big-named, influential figure talking about how wearing a seat belt not only saved his life, but associates it with being \\"cool\\". Kanye also tackles many other, more pressing issues in his music. <br /> Possibly the most powerful, meaningful song on this album is the track titled, Jesus Walks. In this track Kanye addresses not just one but many issues facing America today, and trys to shed some positive light on the. In the beginning of this track it stars with what sounds like the chants that most people would associate with a slave chant, and then the song breaks into what sounds like a church choir chanting the words \\"Jesus Walks\\". This song addresses so many issues throughout the entire song that it is tough to pick out one point where Kanye is not trying to make his listeners open up their eyes on some specific issue. In one section of the song the lyrics say \\"To the hustlers, killers murders, drug dealers even the strippers. Jesus walks with them. To the victims of welfare for we're living in hell here. Jesus walks with them.\\" In these lines Kanye tries to show that even though people may take a bad direction in life they will always have Jesus on their side, which also represents an opportunity to make a change for the better. <br /> Kanye West packs his debut album with catchy beats, and meaningful lyrics. He is a whole new breed of hip-hop artist, in that he comes at you with a true message, far away form the stereotypical cars, money, and women messages that stereotypical rap portrays. It is this mix of catchy beats laced with positive messages that will turn Kanye West, and his alum The College Dropout into a huge success, and hopefully Kanye can continue this trend with his music into what should be several more albums, because the world will never run out of issues, so in turn Kanye will never run short on ideas. <br />

B0009UC7H0|3.0|Character actor Steve Zahn is the main attraction in this adventure flick about junk hunters that inadvertently get turned onto -- and get involved in a big way with -- a multinational chemical effuent problem generated by a manufacturer in Africa that is causing a continetal disease.<br /><br />Zahn is part of a group that searches for expensive old junk and ends up traversing African countries running into and away from bad guys. Zahn, who is always a pleasure to watch, outduels the bigger name stars in the flick  (Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz among them) and has a great scene near the end where he unloads about 20 guns from his person.<br /><br />This is a fun movie with a lot of great African scenery shot aboard boats and in sand dunes. There's a lot of action that helps you forget this is about the dumbest conglomeration of ideas you've ever seen put together in a movie. The flick starts out during the Civil War and ends up in modern day Africa, and somehow strings together all this nonsense for a feel good ending.<br /><br />Never mind that but pay attention to Zahn. He's a blast and is by far the best thing going in this flick. Fans of high adventure, action and mayhem will like this inventive if somewhat stupid movie. It is exceptionally well shot and lively in almost every frame. Pick it up today if you like these elements but don't hold your breath waiting for any Academy Award nominations.
B00005J6UP|4.0|This has been a favorite of mine since I was a little girl.

0385493800|1.0|I read The Testament this past weekend.  This was my first John Grisham book, and I was not familiar with his writing style.  Two chapters into the book, I found the characters shallow and the premise anemic.  These perceptions did not improve with time.  I skimmed through the last three chapters to save time, and tossed the book into the corner when I was finished.   <br /> <br />I'm not a fan of the legal genre, and I found the repeated usage of terms like, \\"holographic will\\" and \\"testamentary capacity\\" boring.  Okay, it's cool that you know what those words mean.  You know what's even cooler?  Using them just once, and letting people look up the darned things if they can't follow along.  Repeating them over and over just makes it sound like you're trying to work the Word of the Day into your life. <br /> <br />In short, I would not recommend this book.  And, given the previous reviews that this is Mr. Grisham's finest work, I would not recommend any book within his collection.
0393035158|5.0|..for anybody that's ever read (or at least follows) the Bible or the Koran.  Harris' whole theme is rationality and empiricism, and that the world is in grave danger because most humans are hardwired to discard these values in the face of religion.  The absurdity of fundamental religious belief (particularly Islam, he calls a spade a spade)will likely result in continuing pain and horror for mankind; the same way it has for 2000 years or more. <br /> <br />Scary.  Right on the money.  Amazing that this point of view has such a small audience.
B000024OTG|4.0|I enjoyed listening to this CD.  The music is so up beat and fun to dance to.
0316172324|1.0|This book suffers from numerous problems. The first is that while it claims to be about \\"the power of thinking without thinking,\\" this is only one of three ideas that are discussed. The failure to mention the other ideas in the title might have been acceptable if they were mentioned explicitly in the text, but it is unclear that Gladwell realizes the distinction. The second problem is that the book is made up of six distinct essays, and they have been sloppily edited to produce a book that is simultaneously disjoint and repetitive. Though perhaps the second problem is really just a symptom of the third problem, that Gladwell's style is painfully repetitive to begin with. Gladwell does not simply beat dead horses, he beats the dust into which he has reduced their carcasses. The fourth problem is that towards the end of the book Gladwell goes off on a tangent about \\"situational autism\\" that is both poorly motivated and very likely to offend the autistic community. And finally, rather than having an introduction and conclusion that tie the book together, these sections present whole new situations; the conclusion in particular seems largely unrelated to the rest of the book. <br /> The book has four points. First, is that the human mind has an impressive ability to process information at an unconscious level very quickly. For instance, by listening to a brief snippet of a doctor speaking, even if the recording is digitally altered so that all you can hear is the tone, you can very accurately determine whether the doctor has good bedside manner. Similarly, by watching a few seconds of a college professor's lecture, even with the sound turned off, you can make a remarkably accurate determination of whether the professor is a good lecturer. <br /> The second point is that this ability often leads us astray. Our unconscious can be shown to harbor prejudices against blacks, women, and others, and these prejudices are bad for both us and society. And on a less socially relevant note, people consistently prefer the taste of liquor that comes in fancy bottles. The book gives absolutely no advice about how to improve our unconscious's attitudes towards either minorities or conventional packaging of foodstuffs. <br /> Without explicitly mentioning it, the book points out the importance of making decisions based on relevant information, rather than large quantities of irrelevant data. The best example of this is given in the introduction. An apparently ancient Greek statue is analyzed with all sorts of fancy chemistry equipment, and the lab technicians come back and say that the marble is indeed from an ancient Greek quarry and that the surface of the marble has a chemical composition that is usually the result of centuries of weathering. On the other hand, any art historian worth his salt can tell you that the feet of the statue are carved in a style never seen in any other Greek statue. While the information from the chemists seems more concrete (their equipment costs more), the relevant fact here is the style of carving in the feet-the statue is a modern forgery. <br /> Finally, the book talks about ways to improve decision making under intense time pressure, for instance in a military engagement or police shootout. The conclusion, not surprisingly, is that practice making split-second decisions is important. Also, if you can slow down the pace of the engagement in order to allow yourself more time, you should do so, but if slowing down gives your opponents a greater advantage, you shouldn't. <br /> If you have made it through this review, there is certainly no need to read the book. Every idea Gladwell had has been summarized and clarified here. Which should really make you wonder how he stretched the book past 20 pages, let alone 200! <br />
0895260131|4.0|While it is clear that Mr. Spencer is not a supporter of Islam I found the book appeared to be well researched and informative.  I think this book does a service because at a time we are at war with Islamo-facists Americans should not be fooled by this so called \\"religion of peace\\".  This book also enlighted me what actually occured during the mid-evil crusades.  It is important for people to understand what happened because distortions are burned into the collective Muslum mind.  In any conflict you have to know your enemy intimately.

Though he dosent run, he does kill vicouly. And the part i dont get is why they focus on nudity than the actual horror in the movie than anything else. This is a horror movie. So maybe Jc might be a perv, but a scary movie!

B000AADYRQ|5.0|I bought this cd over the weekend and it made so happy that I have a hard time discussing it with you people. I was in a pretty somber mood on Friday because my VCR screwed up and didn't tape the Blossom marathon I had been waiting to see. Mayim Bilalick is just sooooo hot. If every woman had a nose that sexy, I wouldn't cry as much as I do. Anyway, I head out shopping for some things and the name of this band caught my eye. I didn't know who cutie was or why you'd take a death cab, but I was intrigued. I got home and put it on the stereo and it's as if the happy fairy came into my house and smacked me senseless with it's wand. All of sudden I was skipping around my house and singing show tunes to my fish, Beast with gills. I felt like Gene f-ing Kelly dancing around the house. If they had announced that Blossom had been renewed at that point I wouldn't have been any happier. It's nice to have these moments after a week full of people pulling Ronald Miller scams. I had a hot girl offer me $3000 to pretend to be her boyfriend for an hour back in high school. I said what the heck, like it would change my popularity at all. The girl ended up getting voted prom queen and got to talk to me once. She was happier than a family getting a new house on that crazy show on PBS. When I have a conversation with you, it's not one you'll forget. I'll change the topic from Pat Benatar's hair to how stupid that Andy Milonmukis show is on Mtv and you won't even know what hit you. That's what I do, live with the fact I'm the real American Idol.
B000000W71|2.0|I like Gary's music. I listen to most of his post seventies albums - the hard rockin' ones as well as bluesy ones. But this isn't the best of Gary's blues no way. Only one third of the tracks are bluesy and there's no Texas strut or his fine cover of As the years go passing by, to name a few. And the ballads... they are the worst part of Gary's catalogue in general.Stiry of the blues and Still got the blues are the exception, but mostly Gary sounds too sweet and slick. Get Out in the fields for example. It has the best numbers from here as well as more  <br />rocking ones. Or buy his studio albums from 1982 onward.

6303148352|4.0|This movie is brilliant!  The effects are amazing, suspense is professionally done, the dinosaurs a virtually real, a corker!! <br /> <br />It's about some people who are invited to a theme park full of cloned, brought-back-to-life dinosaurs.  But when they get trapped in the park with the dinosaurs, and the body count rises, they must find a way out before they are dino droppings!!! <br /> <br />I liked this movie because the acting is well done, and the dinosaurs look sooooo real you wouldn't believe!!!  Speilberg really showed what he was capable of, though he was better in the notorious JAWS!  The only bad thing about the film is the science.  Some dino's are too big, some too small, and some plainly overexagerated.  Most of the science is made up and fake. <br /> <br />But apart from that, a fantastic movie, worth the watch!!!
B00025ETIW|4.0|This is a good/great album.  I never thought of my self as a MyChemicalRomance (seeing how I usually like bands like Sham 69,Misfits) fan but I really like them, what can I say.  I'm going to risk sounding stupid but I don't think the guys are jerks, they know where they come from, take time out to talk to their fans and do respect all of their fans no matter how weird they might be.  I'm not like the typical girls who like them, I like them for their music and message not their looks(even though the bass player is attractive...:-) or because its \\"cool\\" to like them.

The best bit of this movie is when the rex trashes through san diego like an elephant on a climbing frame.   <br /> <br />Watch this movie for a good night out, but there are better movies out there!
B0009SS00A|5.0|The 34 year old computer geeks with pocket protectors and tape on their glasses have come out from behind the Univac posters in the bedrooms of their parent's basements to invalidate the capability of this plot! <br />And, Funny how the folks from Spain get their Drawers in a bunch about Browns geographical depictions in this fictional contribution???  Of the 1000 or so books I have read from Non-American (I happen to be American) born authors, I have probably mentally noted at least 300 settings that involved a negative or derrogitory impression of various US cities. Do I hold that against those writers? No. RELAX, It's a book! This is a FICTION book. Yes, Brown in this book, like ALL of his books, MASTERFULLY meshes what is real and/or fact with what is NOT real and/or fiction.  But to be insulted, give me a break. <br /> <br />Did I note some flaws in the book? Yes.  I read Shakespeare; I read Camus; I read James Patterson; I read Dan Brown. <br /> <br />I read specific authors for specific purposes. Shakespeare offers me the mood of 15th and 16th Century England, along with a TON of historical intrigue....and OH, a little wit and charm. <br /> <br />....I read Dan Brown to be entertained. He succeeded mightily, as usual, in entertaining me with Digital Fortress. <br /> <br />as it has occured, I find myself wanting to review the REVIEWERS more than the reviewed here....The book itself is delightfully entertaining, its TECHNICAL flaws, consistent with the \\"Shlock Thriller\\" genre, part of its charm and allure. <br /> <br />It makes me want to vomit, however, when the \\"I am more educated and learn'ed than thou\\" contributors surface and produce their \\"Diahrrea-of-the-mouth-overtly-mega-critical-critique\\" of something like Digital Fortress. <br /> <br />Dan Brown SIMPLY aims to manipulate the 500 page Fru-Fru thriller cocktail by adding a twist of booksmart education and a dash of modern forward thinking on the rocks...But he stays true to the roots of his genre - Hestill serves it up with a tropical toothpick umbrella! <br /> <br />the reason this guy is PRINTING money....Because he CONTINUES to entertain us...And for every \\"critic\\" that wants to disparage his efforts, there are 10 people lining up to buy his book (and soon to see his movie!) <br /> <br />He IS who he is. His stuff IS what it is. <br /> <br />Orb
1593555555|3.0|Read the first one, almost died, at some point I woke up to paramedics over me.  But I thought, hey, there's 9 of these, gotta be good somewhere right?  Well, this one was better.  The world feels a bit more real (still tackily fake sometimes) and the ideas and characters are more interesting.  The plot was alright, a bit deus ex machinistic to me.  You absolutely know that when a character says something about certain kind of wizards, and no one's touched it in thousands of years, where it's going from there.  Here's the big problem though.  Writing style.  Perfect grammar might be nice for English majors, but in entertainment value writing it is not.  It sounds dead, forced, whatever.  But when every single character has perfect grammar you wonder.  It makes the dialogue, well, laughable.  I don't remember laughing quite like I did for the first one, but there were moments.  But like my title says, it is better than the first one, and was enough to keep me into the next one at least.  I hate dropping a story in the middle, so I rarely do unless it seriously kills me.  So we get to see.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This is a classic Rock N Roll album. The Rolling Stones are the greatest band ever and this is one of their impressive 4 album run that no other band in history matched. From Beggers Banquet to Exile...Every one of those 4 albums is a masterpiece and one of the best albums in Rock. As far as the music on this album, it's been said already, this is a masterpiece.

0451167716|4.0|You have my permission to laugh at the fact that I have never seen these movies.  But I think that this might have given me a more unique perspective in that I didn't know what to expect from this book.<br /><br />This book was GREAT!  A truly modern classic.  I wish that Mr. Puzo had written more additions to this story line, but I will enjoy picking up \\"The Sicilian\\" to continue the series.<br /><br />There are a few scenes in this book that should be intended for adults only, and frankly, I think the story could have done without them.  But the overall feel of the success of the Corleone Familia was quite intriquing.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Damon Albarn achieved with Gorillaz what Blur never even grasped. In the future, Gorillaz will prove to be much more significant to music and modern culture than Albarn's main band. Demon Days is far better than the average albuns in the music industry. It is innovative, it is fresh and points to new directions as Danger Mouse and Damon Albarn freed their mind to give their minds inspiration - the benefits of a side project band! <br /> <br />One should get started in the Gorillaz world by their first album and then try Demon Days. That is the only way one can drilldown the amount of ambiencies and sounds in full. Songs like \\"Dare\\" and \\"Demon Days\\" demand more than one listening.  <br /> <br />Wish all Top Ten records were like these!
B000001FTD|5.0|I was blown away when I first heard this back in 1986 - 1987. I love every song on this album. This is the first metal album I heard and I've been a metalhead since then. Can't go wrong with this, anyone that claims to be a metal fan in general that doesn't have this in their collection is not a true metalhead.

1573223026|4.0|Four people - A former  morning TV talk show host who has lost his career, family and reputation as a result of an ill-advised affair with a 15-year-old girl; a deeply religious woman who simply cannot see any hope beyond a life sentence of constantly caring for her disabled, vegetative son; a musician whose dreams of rock stardom have instead faded into a career as an adult pizza delivery person and  a manic, hostile teenage girl - all show up on the same night atop the same building, a popular London location for those about to commit suicide. Effectively ruining one another's plans for the evening (jumping off the roof, I guess, is something people prefer to do alone), the book follows these four as they form a sort of de facto, if extremely dysfunctional, support group based on the one thing they all share in common: the feeling of being completely at the end of your rope and wanting to end it all.    Who else but Nick Hornby could write a novel with such a dark premise, featuring four suicidal characters, yet still have the novel be accurately described as hilariously funny? A real credit to this novel is how the comedy sometimes reaches the level of slapstick, then in the next paragraph will portray the same characters with such sensitivity and empathy it almost breaks your heart. A fair criticism of the novel could be that with the exception of Maureen, the character with the severely handicapped son, none of the characters problems really seem to be so dire to where one would be driven to the brink of suicide. I wonder if Hornby felt it would be impossible to keep the tone of the book somewhat light if the circumstances of his characters were much harsher?     I enjoyed the unique narration of this novel, telling the story in four separate first-person narratives so the reader is able to get each characters perspective on the events of the novel and also see how each character is seen through the lens of the other characters eyes. As a reader, I also truly appreciate Hornby's absolute refusal to ever let his story descend into schmaltz. No character experiences any sort of cheesy, life-affirming epiphany where they suddenly realize, gosh dangit, life really is worth living after all. This isn't to say this isn't ultimately an optimistic or even uplifting book; the fact the book earns this description without ever becoming maudlin is a real credit to the storytelling ability of the author.
B00007KWHN|5.0|Ah, the first truely great Yes album, as we all know, Yes consists of some of the most talented musicians you can imagine, including Chris Squire, one of the most innovative bassists and Bill Bruford, a technicaly gifted drummer that could rival Neil Peart, then add Jon Anderson and his unique falseto vocals and \\"state of conciousness\\" lyrics and you have a totaly original band, a band that would define the true potential of progressive rock...Though Yes and Time and a Word were pretty good respectivly, at that time they were still looking for a suitable direction to take musicaly. The making of time and a word was a major obstacle in Yes's complex career, they had the idea of adding a symphony orchestra to compliment the already lush arrangements, unfortunatly this left original guitarist Peter Banks very low in the mix, and eventualy led to his departure from the group. Enter Steve Howe, who had tons of experience from playing in 60s psychedelic rock bands such as the tomorrow, his virtuosity on guitar far exceeded his predecessor, and his contrebutions helped carve what would be known as the destinctive Yes sound...The Yes Album is the first Yes album to feature completely original material, and is the first album to really showcase the bands songwriting skills as well as their instrumental talents, 4 songs off the album are around the 6 minute mark, these paved the way for even lengthier Yes epics such as Close to the Edge and Gates of Delerium, a characteristic that has been widely associated with Yes and progressive rock in general. The Yes Album is their rubber soul, the first of many groundbreaking albums in Yes's always evolving catalog.  <br /> <br />\\"yours is no disgrace\\"-The first of many great Yes mood pieces, the songs lyrics tell of soldiers going to war, like many Yes epics the song has many moods, the song begins with a upbeat funk groove that elvoves into a tasteful keyboard and guitar exchange, this song is a great example of how Yes can cover a disperate range of styles on one track, and better yet, making it work. Howes guitar virtuosity is beautifuly showcased here as he thouchs on everything from country to funk to jazz in a sea of multi layered guitar parts, the song is complex and weird yet catchy, acessible and inviting, making such a epic is a task not many prog bands have achieved, which only shows how special a band Yes really were.  <br /> <br />\\"the clap\\"-One of the 2 short pieces on this album, clap(forever renamed the clap because of Andersons mispronouncing the title on the tracks intro)was recorded live, it's a acoustic guitar solo from Howe, once you hear it you are instantly reminded of Chet Atkins, one of Howes primary influences, his solo is a wonderful blend of country, bluegrass and ragtime jazz, full of lush and colorful imagry...You will get lost in it.  <br /> <br />\\"starship trooper\\"-My favorite song off the album, it opens drasticly with Howes ethereal guitar and Andersons warm and playful vocals, like it's title, the song has a space rock feel to it, but not in the Pink Floyd tradition of gloomyness and insanity, its a very upbeat song, as is the rest of the album, once again Howes guitar work is rich with imagination and versatility, including a unusual ode to bluegrass in the middle of the song, the vocal harmonys are sweet and breathtaking, and Howes amazing guitar histronics are beautifuly complemented by Squires bass and Brufords drums...The outro is my favorite part, as it begins with a spacey effects leaden riff that slowly builds and builds until finally exploding into a crunching guitar solo delivered with powerful force...A damn good song, like a religious experience.  <br /> <br />\\"i've seen all good people\\"-This is a great song, its devided into 2 parts, the first is called Your Move while the second is simply called All Good People, the song begins with a odd vocal harmony that ends abbrubtly, and is followed by Howes sweet mandolin, the vocal work is Anderson at hismost mellow and relaxed, the first half is a very folk inspired, almost medievil like ballad, Andersons vocals are soon complemented by recorders and woodwinds, and delivers a sweet beatles esque chorus, the first half ends suddenly, and the second half kicks in, which is a funky offbeat contrast to the first half, Howe quickly goes from mandolin to guitar, delivering a hard rocking riff that drives the rest of the song, the opening lines in the songs opening are now the verses for the songs second half, Howe soon breaks into a fun rockabilly guitar solo(ironicly, Howe got his start playing for rockabilly groups in the late 50s)and the song ends with nothing but vocals that hits a lower octave everytime it repeats that same simple line that the song opened with, a truely unique ending to a truely unique song, despite it's odd delivery and length this song is a staple on classic rock radio stations.  <br /> <br />\\"a venture\\"-Another short track, this one is very jazzy in nature, and it best showcases Tony Kayes brillant and subtle keyboard passages(he was later replaced by Rick Wakeman for the making of Fragile)...The vocals have a showtune like delivery, one of the lesser tracks on the album, but still a worthy addition and a fun listen.  <br /> <br />\\"perpetual change\\"-A great way to close the album, featuring some beautiful instrumental passages from Squire, Howe and Kaye alike...This song is very dreamy and relaxing, with Kayes Gershwin like keyboard harmonics and surreal synthlines and Howes tasteful jazz/country solos and fills...Andersons vocals on here are especialy lovely, but its Squires bass that best complements the song, sublime.  <br /> <br />If you haven't heard much Yes, this is the perfect place to start, though Fragile and Close to the Edge are probably better, this is much more acessible for casual listeners who are just begining to discover the truely one of a kind band that is Yes.

B00006RU5B|5.0|This band is the perfect combination of two awesome bands. the only thing that ever even slightly put me off about Rage was Zach de la Rocha's vocals, and I have always thought of Chris Cornell as one of the greatest vocalists alive, so combining his singing and talent with writing grunge music with the heavy riffs and amazing guitar stylings of the master Tom Morello creates something truely awesome

B0009QBLA8|5.0|Eraserhead is the most disturbing, warped, and surreal films possibly ever made. The movie is very well made, good acting, incredible cinematography and special effects (i.e. the baby) so well done it will make your skin crawl as you wonder \\"Is that thing real?\\" The baby is so hideous, it's slight off pitch cry is the only thing that is even remotely human about it.Would I recommend this movie? It depends. To most, I would strongy encourage them NOT to watch, it's too bizarre, it's too weird. But then, to some who can take it, I would highly recommend it. In terms of bizarreness, Pi is the only other movie that even comes close, but even that looks like Mr. Rogers Neighborhood in comparison to Eraserhead.
B0009QTS1M|4.0|Lets start off with the historical misrepresentations.  1. Maximus never existed.   2. Marcus Aurelius never intended to make one of his generals emperor. Rather, a general proclaimed himself emperor once hearing news that Marcus Aurelius died however, his troops executed him shortly after for making that absurd proclaimation.  3. Commodus was not killed in a gladatorial battle in the Collesseum. He was executed by a wrestler that he was training with at home.  4. Rome was not returned to a republic after Commodus's death but, a successor was appointed.    The historical inaccuracies here are mindboggling furthermore, infusing fictional characters during history may be acceptable for artistic lisence purposes however, changing the outcome of historical events cannot be justified since thats considered rewriting history which is what happened in this film.  Most people like myself were not aware of the detailed history of Rome therefore we assumed that the characters and events that this movie portrayed were factual to an extent, However that wasnt the case and I personally felt intellectually cheated  for being mislead in that way. this movie did present some factual events such as of Commodus killing his father (although that is mostly speculation since historical records do not clearly indicate how Marcus Aurellius died), Commodus ruling as emperor of rome, COmmodus performing as a gladiator in the collesseum although he fought against gladiators forced to use wooden sticks while he used lethal weapons. Thats why he always won. Commodus also ruled rome for 12 years unlike this movies portrayal of a 2-3 year period.    As much of a Sacrilege to history this movie presented, the plot is nevertheless compelling and the visuals are extraordinary. Russell Crow was believable as a fierce gladiator with a moral a conscience outside the arena.    In conclusion, Ridley Scott basically patched some facts together and made a fictional story. It appears maximus's character was inspired by the  true history of  Spartacus's rebellion against Rome. THe Parallels are apparent by Maximus and Spartacus rallying gladiators of different cultures and languages to overcome  the Roman challenges however, The Irony is that true history of Spartacus's rebellion is more grand and more inspiring since he reallied thousands of people (not a mere 20 like Maximus) to defeat thousands of highly trained roman legions  9 consecutive times in open war battles (not in a staged arena such is what Maximus did). Spartacus amazingly kept up this rebellion for a period of 2 years until he was finally outnumbered by 3 roman legions.

6305127646|3.0|I love the suspense of the chase scenes while they are in Russia.
6300214028|5.0|An epic movie chronicling the lives of John Reed (played by Warren Beatty), revolutionary during the early years of the 20th century, author of TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD (about the Communist revolution in Russia), and the only American buried in the wall of the Kremlin; and his wife Louise Bryant (played by Diane Keaton). Actually the movie is nothing more than your typical love story set against a strongly developed historical background. The use of \\"witnesses\\" who, in a documentary style, relate the historical events of the times (c.1914-1919) is excellent: their comments are interesting and engaging. The movie is an ambitious one - it shows a strong affinity and feel for the chaotic political times of the WW I era. Obviously a lot of care was taken to get things right - the look of things especially. The love story between Beatty and Keaton presents the most problems, maybe because finally it just seems so typical: boy meets girl, they fall in love, get married, have differences and split up, get back together again, etc. Keaton is to me a single-character actress (high-strung, always on the verge of going off the deep end), and her Annie Hall nervousness is misplaced here. She goes from a self-assertive, independent \\"artist-writer\\" to the sacrificial good wife who idolozes her husband. Jack Nicholson is good in a cameo role as Eugene O'Neill. A bit long at 195 minutes, but very well done and fascinating to watch, despite the problems.<br /><br />Hopefully the DVD will be out very shortly.
0385510454|4.0|Joel Backman is possibly the most hated man in Washington.  Six years ago he pled guilty to illegal possession of government documents, but the truth about what he knew angered multiple countries and resulted in numerous deaths.  Now the director of the CIA has convinced the outgoing President to pardon Blackman so they can sit back and watch to see which county finds him and kills him.  Blackman, released and tucked away in a small town in Italy is not a dumb man.  He realizes that his life is in danger, but the big question is who can he trust?  All the while he is trying to learn to adapt to his new surroundings and environment without knowing the Italian customs or language. <br /> <br />Grisham is almost back to his early days of writing with The Broker.  It is a very light read and the story definately has some holes in it, but it is somewhat reminicent of Grisham's early days where the story is very fast paced and keeps you wanting more.  Grisham has found his niche as long as he is content with writing fun novels that are perfect for the beach.

B00005QDW1|3.0|I suppose I thought this might be more like \\"Return to Saturn,\\" which dealt with some complex emotions and issues, and had great punk/ska/techno sounds on it.  Instead \\"Rock Steady\\" sounds geared toward high school girls or young women having their first real crush (or having their first beer, even). The songs are fun and good to have on as background music (where mindless repetition isn't a problem), but don't look for depth or even great songwriting.  A bit of a waste of their talents.

B00068NVI4|4.0|In the 1980's Jethro Tull sang to us that \\"you're never to old to rock & roll, if you're to young to die\\". But it is YES in 2005 that has proven it to be true. Seasoned, mature craftmen of progressive rock, rock the house during their 35th Anniversary concert tour...& this DVD captures all of their power, talent & dynamics.<br /><br />The set list provies a twist for old time YES fans including deep track nuggets like Sweet Dreams & Turn of the Century...the set also is padded with plently of classics too like Startrip Troopper, All Good People, & Yours is No Disgrace.<br /><br />The entire performance is top shelf but there are three pinacles that will bring chills to the spines of YES fans. The first highlight is the musical sandwich created with Time Drive & South Side of the Sky. Steve Howe & Rick Wakeman battle lead lines in South Side & lift the song to a new level of relavance.<br /><br />The second highlight is the acoustic set that opens the second half of the show following intermission. Mellow, made for acoustic performance song like Wonderous Stories are included, but a redesigned shuffle version of Roundabout unpluggled pumps new life into this YES signature classic.<br /><br />The third highlight is the spine tingling rendition of And You & I. The DVD provides a glimps into how moved the audiance actually was during the souring instrumental middle break of this timeless classic. Audiance shots show many fans turning to each other to make sure that they are not dreaming & to see if the person next to them is sailing as high as they are.<br /><br />The sound quality on this DVD is very good, & YES fans know that over the past 35 years it has been difficult for record albums & CDs to properly handle the complicated layers of YES music. This DVD does a very noble job. Picture quality is good & editing is smooth & not herky jerky & over produced like typical juvenile MTV videos.<br /><br />Rock & Roll Regards,<br /><br />drumming57@yahoo.com

068983571X|4.0|When I read the back of the book, I thought this was going to be a fantasy novel. It turns out, while the story is fictional, it could very well be a true story and not far-fetched at all. The characters are slightly confusing, and the middle tends to lag on a bit, but overall, it was a nice read. It's not one of those one-sitter books, but if you have a lot of time on your hands and would like to read an anticipating novel, The Hound of the Baskervilles is a great pick. :)
B000002P7R|5.0|this is a good album to own, a must have for any of the hendrix fans out there and i know there is many. i love all the songs from this album but the last track on here is my favorite. anything by hendrix is worth it. he is the stratocaster master.
B00005JODA|2.0|This could have been such a good movie. Despite its clichd plot (big business bad) the settings and character development could have been great. Instead the director decided to just run with the clichs and ignore the rest. The cinematography was trying too hard to seem artistic using jerky, erratic motion and subdued hues. It could have been very beautiful but was just distracting.  <br />The plot was very clichd and simplistic. It totally ignored the other factors in the region like corrupt governments (well, not totally but enough to seem so) and makes the African people seem like victims who need help from the \\"white man\\" instead of the strong people that they are.  <br />Overall this movie was a just a huge disappointment to me. <br />  <br /> <br />
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I love this album just as i loved transatlanticism. by far my favorite band ever. favorite tracks: marching bands of manhattan, soul meets body, what sarah said. if youve been thinking about checking out death cab, do it. theyre awesome!

B000AJJNOK|1.0|dont get me wrong his first album was tight..but now 50's doin exactly what he's dissed Ja-Rule for doin....he's crossed over and went \\"pop\\" and MTV..he's singin his own hooks and only makin music for the clubs...if any of ya'll think this is real hip hop..u need to educate yourself to the culture...50 continues to hate and trys to bring every emcee down with him...he shouldnt have titled this album the \\"massacre\\" but instead \\"the downfall\\" 50 better come hard with his next album or he's destined to fall off....u want a good CD from the G-Unit camp pick up Buck's \\"Straight Outta Cashville\\"
B000021Y77|5.0|Great movie! I finaly watched it. Premise: \\"We are destined to rerun our life tape over and over again until we decide to live it the way we realy want. Just keep going and be true to yourself all the way.\\"
B00025ETIW|5.0|I don't like this album, the hot chick next to me wants to bang Gerard Way. Go buy this if you are a adolescent girl obsessed with guys and make up....blah!
B00006CXXU|5.0|All the songs in this album are just great.<BR>Can't wait for her next album...
B00005V0X5|5.0|This is thrash/speed metal about as good as you can get it (in my opinion of course). This album is very raw and contains some VERY fast songs. Mechanix (the original version of Metallica's four horsemen)is much faster than four horsemen by Metallica. This is one of my favorite debut albums. WARNING: Be sure that you can handle Dave's voice, many people hate it. If you are just getting into Megadeth and like their 80s stuff then I highly recommend this album. For fans of Cryptic Writings and such: this album MIGHT be too hard for you, it's a very different Megadeth. There is some major talent in this band, these guys can PLAY!! I love this album. It is to bad that they had to beep out the lyrics in These Boots (at first it pissed me off, but when I got over I found it pretty funny).
0060926317|3.0|A fun, thoughtful and, at times, moving little book; compares well to the 'Celestine Prophecies' in that it makes some very important esoteric or spiritual `truths' available in a simple, straightforward style. Consequently, some may find it a touch contrived at times. Obviously, a big debate still rages about whether the events described actually took place, but that, for me, misses the point. If you gain insights into yourself and embrace ideas that resonate authentically within you - if you find yourself taking one small step towards being a happier, freer person - who cares what prompted you to do so? The important thing is that something did. Right?  <br /> <br />Whether you enjoy this book or not, I would heartily recommend `Tuesdays with Morrie' and `Jonathan Livingston Seagull'.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|WARNING: SPOLIERS AHEAD    I have mixed feelings about this film. I saw The Phantom live in San Francisco when I was fourteen and it was truly a mind altering experience. Everything about the production was first rate, the costumes, the music, and the singing especially the Phantom, played by Davis Gaines, whose power lept off the stage.     When I heard a movie was being made I was apprehensious to say the least. Seeing Joel Shumacher's name as the director was part of the reason for that. After seeing him butcher Batman, I was concerned that he would take too many liberties with this. Thankfully he did keep some things of the show, and enough of them to keep it going. Unfortunately, he didn't keep enough of them in.    The Good:  Emmy Rossum is luminescent as Christine. She plays the character as innocent and as naive, more so than the stage version. Her voice has the clear quality that it brings chills to the spine, it's the best in the film. Patrick Wilson stumbles a bit with the role. Never crossing over in Errol Flynn like heroism, but confident with his voice. My one requirement with the songs was that they not completely screw up \\"All I Ask of You,\\" which is my favorite song in the show, and their voices meld perfectly. The costume and production design elevate and go beyond the orginal show, giving it the sumptious quality it always deserved. The cinematography is excellent, no surprise since John Matheison is a genius at using existing light and shadows to further the effects of the already incredible sets. The music is so much more lush than the stage version, naturally. The added moment of the phantom's orgins was pretty cool as well.    The Bad:  Gerard Butler? Sorry buddy, you sound like an American Idol reject. You need someone in this roll that has power in his voice as well as a tortured sound, Gerard has none of that. As well as the fact that his face which, in the stage play, looked disfiguring and something that would explain his isolation, fear,and horror look know looks like a bad sunburn.     The \\"Masquerade section, although extremely well done as far as the costumes and sets for the extras go, falls apart when the Phantom appears. He is supposed to be The Mask of the Red Death from Edgar Allen Poe's legendary story and in the stage show, he's wearing a mask that like Lon Chaney's version, fills the onlookers with horror at seeing him. His mask is a full on skull, without a semblence of face behind it. In the film, it's a smaller mask, only covering up the eyes and the nose only. It's not scary or awe inspiring.     The sword fight is unecessary. Everything before that is wonderful, it's just that the fight itself doesn't solve anything or lead anywhere. They could've gotten the same result in a more dramatic way and it doesn't fit with the Phantom's character. Throughout the film you see him in the shadows. He takes out people conspicuously and mysteriously to create an ambient level of fear, all the while maintaining a ghostly appearance. It has the feeling of they put it in because they could.     The \\"Point of No Return\\" was where I screamed the loudest when I saw it. The dancers in the backround are an uneeded distraction, it's completely pointless for them to be there. Christine is gorgeous but the Phantom, wooing her in the stage production under a cloak and always too close for the guards to shoot her, know is behind a cowboy and indian mask and only touches her toward the end.     The ending, with him leaving through the mirror, doesn't have the same shock as the original.    All in all I was impresed with some, dissapointed with some obvious stuff, and grateful to see so much of it on screen. If you've seen this movie and haven't seen the show, don't worry. The show on stage will truly blow you away!
0694003611|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  The words are lyrical and soothing.  But, the pictures are even better with intricate details that foster memory and concentration.  The flow of the book is an ideal addition to any bedtime routine.

079073804X|5.0|What is it about this 1973 film dealing with the subject of demonic possession that still has such a tight grip on our collective imaginations? Now some thirty years after its theatrical release it still warrants enough interest to generate over 700 reviews on Amazon.com.<br /><br />It certainly isn't just the special effects, which are quite good, because they can easily be outdone with today's technology. Nor can it be explained away by pointing to societies perverse fascination with grotesque images, foul language and projectile pea soup. It's not even the excellent cast, director (William Friedkin) or production values that make this one of the most gripping, unforgettable treatments of spiritual evil ever captured on film.<br /><br />I think the secret is found in something unspoken, but heard nonetheless. Something hinted at on-screen only in fleeting images that remain with us long after they've vanished into the darkness. This \\"Unspoken Something\\" I'm referring to is perfectly captured in the opening prologue of the film, that moment at the archeological dig site in Iraq.<br /><br />Prologue: As the sun sets on the far horizon Father Lankester Merrin finds himself alone. A moment later a pack of dogs begin to growl and fight amongst the ruins just as the wind picks up and swirls of red dust fill the air. Father Merrin realizes he is no longer alone. On a nearby mound stands a statue, a ancient representation of a powerful demon known to the Assyrians and Babylonians as Pazuzu. Merrin stands motionless as he looks deeply into the features of his adversary. They have met before. The essence of this film is encapsulated in this brief moment of realization. The battle for a human soul is about to begin.

6304698682|5.0|A mysterious, unarmed stranger known only as \\"Preacher\\" (Clint Eastwood) rides into town on a pale horse and immediately rekindles the hopes and dreams of a group of poor, struggling panhandlers that have been fighting a losing battle against a wealthy strip mining family and their hired guns. While the odds suggest the stranger should give up and get out while he still can he decides otherwise. Once he removes his collar and straps on his sixshooter there's no turning back. A classic western, good guys versus bad guys all the way!<br /><br />Let me begin by saying I'm not a Clint Eastwood fan. However with that said, I also have to say that this particular movie is the rare exception to the rule. Here Eastwood is at his best; tall, silent, deadly and remote. He plays the part of the anti-hero to perfection.<br /><br />Also fine performances by Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgress, Richard Dysart, Chris Penn and my personal favorite, the lovely Sydney Penny (Thorn Birds).
B0002OERI0|5.0|I see a lot of bashing of this cd because everyone thinks Green Day sold out. This is one of the better recordings in recent years. The idea of a punk opera is really amazing. The talent to make it work is true incredible. Sure they have grown up and are not the mass rebellion that they once were. Now they are more sophisticated in how they rebel against the system and the world. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|have i came to the point that i've seen so many violent movies that to me this movie wasnt disturbing at all. i dont see why everyone is saying this movie is a hard R. it might stay with you even when you go to sleep. it was a pretty good movie kinda predictable. yeah sure the guy is too skinny but thats it, theres nothing else disturbing. im getting tired of the double personality movies. go watch FIGHT CLUB and see the best double personality movie ever.
B000002VRZ|4.0|The editorial review's statement that this music is \\"completely undistinguishable\\" from other Southern Rock, and that it is for die-hards only is misleading, to say the least.  The Outlaws had a distinctive sound and lyrics, much more Western than most of what is called \\"Southern Rock.\\"  There are some forgettable songs on this compilation, in my opinion, but it is worth owning for fans of 70s guitar-driven rock for several of the jewels herein, such as \\"Green Grass and High Tides,\\"  \\"Gunsmoke,\\" \\"Hurry Sundown,\\" and the lesser-known \\"Song For You,\\" among others.  The guitar-playing is excellent, but the tunes are also memorable.  I would even describe some as haunting.
B0000630BT|5.0|Painkiller is my favorite Priest Cd. My favorites from this album include hell patrol, All Guns Blazing, nightcrawler, and between the hammer and the anvil (this one being my favorite with the coolest guitar solo on the cd). I recommend this cd if you are new to judas priest.

0380018179|5.0|I'm a housewife cum secretary for a business and have other commitments too. So I found it terribly challenging to read this book. It wasn't a book, it was like opening a door into another world - and observing the goings on in this incredibly strong character household. The only way to satisfy my eagerness to consume this incredible story[felt real] was by reading at night when the family were all asleep, then I would read until 3am or so - and wake up a couple of hours later like a zombi - but it was well worth it! You simply become addicted with these characters. You Just HAVE to read this book. Colleen is an incredible author. IT'S TRULY THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ IN YEARS.!! <br />
B00008G9JN|5.0|Although there are many great records to choose from, this remains my favorite Jethro Tull album.  I may be biased because I discovered the band in the Songs From the Wood/Heavy Horses phase of their variegated existence, but this album is worth having, regardless of what vintage you like your Tull, or whether you only know the band from their radio hits and want to explore them further.  \\"Cup of Wonder\\" rocks.  \\"Ring Out Solstice Bells\\" is a holiday season rock & roll standard.  \\"Pibroch\\" is the real masterpiece on the album, getting better and sadder with every listen.  After almost 30 years, this is still great music. <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice will never be eclipsed by any other. This is a strong statement to make, but I stand behind it. A couple of remakes and recontextualized versions are either out or in the works, but unless any of them are six hours long, they will not be able to do Austen's novel justice. This is the film for those who love Jane Austen's book just as it is. Due to the film's length, little had to be cut from the story. The period elements are well-done. Colin Firth is the best Darcy I have seen. (Don't even get me started on Laurence Olivier and that horrible black and white travesty that claimed to be P&P.) The writers, producers, and all involved in this film obviously had a great respect for Austen and kept the tone of her work in this film. It is well-acted, funny, visually enjoyable, and never feels long to me, though it is five hours. I wish filmmakers would not try to remake this one; no other film version can top this. <br />One reviewer commented on the DVD color not looking right -- I found that mine seems extra bright in color to me. It's not bad -- it just didn't seem as bright to me when I saw this on tv or video. It also seemed to make a difference whether I was playing it in my computer or on a regular DVD player. I was also able to access captions on my computer, but not on my DVD player -- I don't know why.
0792164903|5.0|This movie is special because it has horror and humor, all mixed up with Tim Burton's great vision and concept art.  Definitly a piece to have in your collection!!

B000AADYYO|4.0|Some great progressive moments. The talent of this band is incredibly impressive!!  Some of the clean stuff is very silly, almost, dare I say mainstream?  But, still worth having and better than 99.9% of the crap out there today.
0895260131|1.0|At least two of the \\"Did you know...?\\"statements on the cover of the book are flat-out lies (the Crusades were not \\"defensive conflicts\\"), and others are hugely misleading (some--a very small minority--within Islam teach that it is a duty to wage war on infidels; most do not).  Have American Muslims done all they should in a timely manner to separate themselves from Islamic extremism?  Assuredly not.  Are they engaged in a unified and monolithic \\"huge cover-up\\" of their history and religion?  No (Jews don't drink the blood of Christian babies, either). It's be worth keeping in mind that Christians have also engaged in reprehensible terrorism (murdering abortion doctors, bombs at the Olympics), and have--at times--had a very bloody history with some very shameful moments.  Didn't I read something about \\"he who is without sin casting the first stone\\" somewhere?  If you are looking for something truly \\"fair and balanced,\\" look elsewhere.  If you are looking for Fox network-style \\"fair and balanced\\", that is, a book to confirm your pre-existing prejudices--this might be just the book for you.

0517223546|5.0|Sarum is a most impressive work. First of all it impresses merely by the daring scope of its story--thousands of characters set in an historically accurate retelling of English history from the Ice Age to the 1980's--but it also impresses by being as altogether good as it is! Set primarily in and around the Salisbury Plain from the period immediately at the point in the post-Ice Age when rising waters cut the island of Britain off from continental Europe, Sarum procceeds thru pre-history to the building of Stonehenge, the arrival of the Romans, the Dark Age Saxon period, the twelfth century, the construction of the awesome monument to Medieval genius that is Salisbury Cathedral, and then follows on into more recent times such as the Black Death, the age of the Tudors, the Civil War, the glorious eighteenth-century, Napoleonic times, the industrial and Victorian ages, and finally it ends its long, unforgettable journey after making last stops in the times of the world wars and finally concludes some 10,000 years after it began, reuniting 1940's-era lovers in happy circumstances in the town of Sarum in 1985.<br /><br />This massive novel is the read of a lifetime and it manages to weave a delightful multi-generational story that never slows or becomes boring, never loses historical rectitude, and absolutely positively never, EVER, makes a reader sorry for starting the bold task of reading this gigantic achievement in novel writing.<br /><br />Mr. Rutherfurd is a gifted writer who achieved little short of the biography of his native land. I recommend Sarum to anyone up to the challenge of devoting at least a fortnight to a journey thru the lives and times that have come to pass on our world's most amazing island nation.
0897500482|5.0|Awesome book. Very insightful regarding the training and throught process of Bruce Lee. Highly recommeneded to all Bruce Lee fans and martial artists alike.
B00003BDXG|5.0|I couldn't stand this film when it came out because i was only a young kid, and it annoyed me, because it was so sensationalized as if it's cool to kill, for teenboppers at my junior high they liked it and bragged about seeing it and how cool it was, that's why i hated it, but i'm 23 now, and the only reason i watch it, because woody harrelson is one of my favorite actors and juliette lewis is also a great actress, a natural talented actor and always has been. My aunt said to me one night, not that her opinion matters, she said \\"IT JUST SHOWS YOU THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE BEAUTIFUL TO BE IN HOLLYWOOD MOVIES AND BE FAMOUS, JULIETTE LEWIS IS UGLY.\\" To me, juliette lewis is a hottie, despite the fact she played a psychotic in this film, and did a dam good job of it too. I liked her blonde wigs most of all. She has a nice body, sexy lips, and that smokey voice that gets deep when she's upset, which adds to her mentally unstable character in this film. It's completely believable when she plays mallory, the psychotic lover of mickey, played by woody. I don't know how to describe this but i will try. First of all her redneck accent is perfect, and her brown natural hair, and hairstyle, goes perfectly with  her criminal character. Remember in the 80's that hair style, almost like a butch dyke hairsttyle but it was long hair, kinda short on top but long in the back. It's hard to explain, not really a biker style haircut, but anyway it goes great with mallory's character when she's not wearing the wigs, her true self is revealed, and that haircut, really was a nice touch. Also, another good actor in this film was the detective chasing mickey and mallory, the one that's nuts also, and wears the g string as he killed the hooker. I forget his name, but he was in true romance which is one of my favorite films. So all in all, i can stand watching natural born killers even though it's bizarre sometimes comical, but great acting, and great actors. As for juliette, who is one of manytalented and often underated and unfairly forgettable actresses, needs to be recognized for her talent. I saw her in my town one time, i was at a stoplight and looked to my right and there she was sipping a starbucks frappacino in her car, and she turned one street down where i live. I think she's beautiful. I should know because i'm a woman and i'm bisexual. Ugly? No way. My aunt is just jealous of her because i said i saw her, and what a great actress she is and how many great films she has been in, and thats when she made that rude comment about juliette. Also woody harrelson played a good psycho too, sweet to his girl, but killed anyone who got in their way. Very interesting film. Somewhat thought provoking because at times you sympathize for mallory and mickey because they are in love, and had absuive childhoods, and you sometimes wonder if they still have a heart if they are able to love each other, and they respect the indians who took care of them, after woody accidentally shot him thinking he was his father. I should have known this was an oliver stone film, just think of midnight express. So for the acting and creativity, i give this film 5 stars.
B00005JNSK|2.0|I was really hoping for a good movie, because my kids loved the book so much, and the Gene Wilder version was a little weird.   <br />This movie is bad.  It seems that they took old movie and updated it - it is creepy.  I love Johnny Dep, but he doesn't seem to have his heart in this movie.  The effects aren't even good.  The plot is shallow.  The oopa loompas are all played by one guy who has no depth.  The songs they sing are awful - you can't really make out the lyrics.  The whole point of this story is to promote positive behaviors of children - and the point got lost somewhere in Charlie's psychosis.  So much could have been done with this film - what a waste.
B000089RVX|5.0|The music was very hip.  The music just moved you to move.
0066620996|3.0|It is a very easy read.  The business philosophy said to attribute to \\"great\\" companies' success is appealing and intuitive.  However, how much trust can we put into its way of reasoning and hence its conclusion is a big question.  Many strategies summarized by the book are either ambiguous or superficial.  I would counter 3 of his 6 major points just to give you some sense.   <br /> <br />The author and his research team surveyed a lot of companies, more than 1500.  But if you are NOT interested in how huge public corporates with at least 25 years of history evolve, this book is not even relevant.  It is a pity that most hi-tech miracles have to be excluded.  Microsoft is too young; Goldman Sachs was private; and the list of companies that cannot selected to be \\"great\\" goes on and on.  Then I started to wonder whether those selected \\"great\\" companies fit my criteria of interests.   <br /> <br />1. Level 5 leadership = Humility + Will <br />It is true that a lot of great companies become great because of a devoted CEO.  But I do not see much practical meaning to say that the \\"Level 5\\" CEO will never be a \\"celebrity\\" type and do not understand how this conclusion can be draw based on merely eleven observations.  After all leadership is not about personality but vision.   <br /> <br />2. Right people are your most important assets <br />Throughout the chapter, I do not see how \\"right\\" people are defined.  Without a clear picture of the \\"right\\" people, can this point serve as a meaningful guidline?  The author examplifies Wells Fargo's firing of all executives of Crocker, an aquired bank, as \\"great\\" companies keeping only the \\"right\\" people.  Each corporate has its unique culture.  Some are conducive to success in its business area while others not.  It is quite common to lay off management of an aquired company due to power clash.  But it is hard to say that those laying others off possess a better culture.  How many not so great companies did the same thing?  The only traits that the book mentions about the \\"right\\" people is \\"rigorous\\".  But is that something new and significant?   <br /> <br />3. Hedgehog vs Fox <br />The author categorizes hedgehog's strategy as \\"simplify a complex world into a single organizing idea, a basic principle or concept that unifies and guides everything\\", and fox's strategy as \\"scattered or diffused, moving in many levels\\".  He think that the \\"hedgehog\\" strategy will outperform \\"fox\\".  He would say that Freud and the unconscious, Darwin and natural selection, Marx and class struggle, Einstein and relativity, Adam Smith and division of labor are metaphors of \\"hedgehog\\" theories.  Every complex theory can be summarized in a few words in essense but is there anything that cannot?  He goes further to hightlight the principles of \\"hedgehogs\\", \\"understand what you can be the best at\\", \\"what is your demominator\\", \\"understand your passion\\".  But can any of those be really called principles?   <br /> <br />Overall, this book is another well packaged business book that cannot suppass the making-believe world.  The extensive supporting data analysis serves mostly as a disguise.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0783227434|4.0|This movie is by far one of the more interesting of Sam Raimi's early works.

0060931671|4.0|...or is Aldous Huxley smoking crack a better analogy?  Either way, know that this is not your average comedy/drama/mystery.<br /><br />The best things about this book are the acerbic wit, unusual circumstances/story line, stream of consciousness style and quirkily (that a word?) endearing characters.  The worst thing about this book is that it's going to require me to read it multiple times and to consult a Crying of Lot 49 primer before I can fully appreciate it - which, on second thought, is not such a bad thing afterall.<br /><br />The base story line details the trials and tribulations of a woman unravelling a mystery found in a dead man's will.  The steps she takes to solve it propel her into a number of unusual circumstances where she encounters a variety of curious and extraordinary characters.  In fact, the premise of the mystery itself is preposterous (in an anti-utopian sci-fi kind of way) yet fascinating.<br /><br />The story line is by no means straight forward and many scenes seemingly come straight out of left field.  It is writing like this either turns you off or on - I happen to fall into the latter category.  If you're more comfortable with a standard three act play format where everything is wrapped up nice and tight at the end, then you best look elsewhere.  Additionally, there are so many obvious references (names, places, situations) to present and past icons that I wonder how many not-so-obvious references I missed.<br /><br />I admit that I didn't fully understand what I read, but it is the challenge of a greater understanding that compels me to do some research and read it again ...well...that plus it was just plain fun to read.  I'll let you know how that turns out...<br /><br />If you enjoy books like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or A Conferacy of Dunces then I'm pretty certain you'll enjoy this as well.  Let me know how that turns out...
B000935TV8|5.0|I plan to give copies of this CD to my friends whose musical taste froze 35 years ago and who think of Baroque music as just so much \\"sewing machine music\\".  Rameau was an imaginative instrumental colorist, and these dance pieces, taken from several of his operas and ballets, show him at his best in that regard. <br />  While the conceit of calling this a \\"symphony\\" may seem strange,  the pieces are arranged to form a nice sequence and, most importantly, are engagingly played by this early music ensemble.  The interpretation is lively and the playing stylish.  The sonics are detailed without being analytical. <br />  I would recommend this to anyone as an introduction to the joys of French Baroque, but would encourage a follow-up purchase of one of the full operas.
B0001CCXY8|3.0|This music is certainly fast, but lacks in skilled drumming. This is a common problem in death metal. The over-use of \\"death beats\\" such as hitting the crash and snare as fast as possible, is utterly ridiculous. Some may say that this is how death metal is played, whether you be \\"ye or ne\\" with this, what it boils down to is that the drummer needs a little bit more practice or they should just get a different one.<br /><br />-Jalance
B00004YA66|4.0|I've always loved this movie for the action, the well-written science fiction, and the father-son love, but the last time I watched it I became aware of way too much slow-moving emotional crap that detracts from the overall impact of an otherwise excellent film.
B000000W6F|4.0|I really hate to be hard on this album in comparison to the Pumpkins' later works, but it has some of their best songs included on the album. From hard rock songs with amazing lead work, such as Tristessa or I Am One, to mellower rhythm based ones, such as Rhinoceros, Crush, and Window Paine. Corgan's vocals are amazingly dynamic and the guitarwork is masterful, even the bass, which is always punctual. The problem I have with this album is with some of the other songs, such as Daydream and Suffer. They're not bad songs, but they seem out of place in comparison to the beautiful melodies on the other tracks. Buy if you like the Pumpkins or grunge/alt rock in general.
B000AL730O|5.0|On his newest album, McCartney finally allows himself to write/compose songs the way he did at the time of the Beatles/ early 70's.    The quality control and production of Nigel Godrich result in an album that has atmosphere, depth, originality, integrity, good lyrics, great harmonies; elements that have often lacked on his albums. The album contains no fillers. In my opinion, the least interesting song of the album is the single Fine Line.    Although some songs could have been on Beatles albums (notably English Tea, Jenny Wren) or early solo albums (Promise to You Girl, A Certain Softness), you sometimes hear echoes of McCartney-inspired musicians like Brian Wilson, 10cc, Queen (Promise to You Girl) and Radiohead/Coldplay (How Kind of You).    McCartney's voice is better than ever. Playing almost all instruments on all tracks does make a coherent, intimate and sometimes experimental sound (like on McCartney I and Flaming Pie). Obvious drawback is that sometimes you miss the creative input of fellow musicians (like on Friends to Go; would have more groove if played with a good band). He is excused for not being the best drummer.    If you do not buy the album, be sure to get Jenny Wren, Vanity Fair and How kind of you.     I was not sure if McCartney would be able to make such an album at the age of 63. But he did.    Highly recommended!    Addendum April 2007:  This album got four Grammy Award Nominations: in 2005 Album of the year, Best pop vocal album, Best male pop vocal performance (Fine Line) and in 2006 Best male vocal performance (Jenny Wren).
B0009UC7H0|2.0|I got this movie because I was wanting a good action movie. I thought it would be like an advanced version of National Treasure (which I loved).  <br /> <br />The truth is folks, it is dull, degrated, and just boring. <br /> <br />The main plot is that 2 guys are looking for a treasure lost in the civil war.  <br /> <br />At many times the movie gets slow and you already know what will happen next. <br /> <br />Another thing is: I'm sure all third world country rersidents speak fluent English.  <br /> <br />If you want a better movie that you won't be dissapointed about, rent XXX: State Of The Union or National Treasure. <br /> <br />Last Word: <br />Not as good as it looks.

B000ASATWQ|4.0|With the possible exception of a little album due to be released in about 2 weeks, you probably won't find a much more hyped reggae album in 2005 than Welcome to Jamrock. It's been a rather long 4 years since the release of Bob's youngest child, Damian's last album, the excellent Halfway Tree, and 'Jamrock' promises to be even more successful than its Grammy winning predecessor.<br /><br />The hype comes in the very unlikely form of the title track which draws its power from an old Junior Reid tune and an even older Ini Kamoze track (somewhere right now Ini is singing \\"Out in the streets they call it murderrrrrrrr\\" and the crowd is thinking he got it from Jr Gong), the song has become a reggae superhit and has even some of the harshest critic calling it one of reggae's finest moment's since the elder Marley was on the scene nearly a quarter century ago.<br /><br />Damian's talents lie, first and foremost, in his production. Quiet as kept, his older brother Stephen has become a true reggae production master over the years, the highlight being the work he did on Halfway Tree, and Jamrock isn't a whole lot behind. Damian also has one of the single best flows in reggae and could seemingly lock down an entire track for about an hour if he ever saw fit.<br /><br />While the title track is destined to receive the most attention here, the rock solid best tune is the closer, Khaki Suit featuring dancehall legends Bounty Killer and Eek-a-Mouse. The song is as polished of an old school gem as you'll hear anywhere and the death grip that Jr Gong lays into the riddim (at one point it appears as if though Bounty is almost fighting for his chance) is highly impressive mixed with Mouse's background its totally the best record. Of course check the hard hitting title track; as well as the apocolyptic opener Confrontation which features both Bunny Wailer and actual voicings of Marcus Mosiah and His Imperial Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie I.<br /><br />You also have to check the fun ska flavored All Night, both of the prerequisite homages to Nesta, the best of which being the awesome Move! (Jr.'s take on Exodus). The second international single Hey Girl, We're Going to Make it which is one of the rare roots moments on the album and of course The Master Has Come Back which is HIGHLY enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, the album is not as good as Halfway Tree, I can't go that far, what I can say is that if you've been sitting around having the title track drummed into your head, you won't be disappointed when you pick up the finished product. Welcome to Jamrock is a big big album and hopefully it becomes a landmark style album which leads more and more fans into what is real reggae music.the fun ska flavored All Night, both of the prerequisite homages to Nesta, the best of which being the awesome Move!

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I was not expecting much with this one.  I was really surprised!  It not only turned out to be pretty funny, but also had a very likable approach and a very up-beat theme.  It was not like the standard \\"teen comedy\\" or \\"nerds are cool if they get a haircut and take of the glasses, and change who they are\\" flicks that have been done over and over again.  This one had spirit, and some very funny moments.  The moments that seemed as if they were going to be uncomfortable (Napoleon's van driving Uncle), always turned out pretty funny.  Overall, this is a good movie to watch if you want to feel better about yourself for any variety of reasons.  Either, \\"I'm not Napoleon\\", \\"Napoleon turned out alright\\", or \\"Napoleon turned out alright and did not change who he was as a person.\\"  Personally, I thought watching him get smacked in the head with a steak was HILARIOUS, but then again, I like to watch Jackass.  This one has something for everyone.  Give it a try and enjoy.
0634049011|5.0|I think when it comes right down to it, learning all the notes on a guitar fretboard, and their various positions, is a formidable task.  The author of this book apparently believes that also ... that is why he has painstakingly developed an outline that is well thought out in order to make this knowledge easier to digest than any other method I have seen.  The instruction is clear, in detail, and innovative in its approach. I have only had the book a short time, so I can't \\"read\\" the fretboard yet ... but clearly, by following this series of study and excercises, I can see that not only will I have the ability to see all the notes and their positions ... but I will have this knowledge for the rest of my life. And that is worth far more than the modest price. <br /> <br />Richard Narrell
B0000028M7|5.0|Alice in Chains was perhaps the best band to emerge in the 1990s and their music has had a major influence on much of the modern rock scene (Godsmack, Creed, Second Coming).  \\"Dirt\\" was a major milestone in the history of rock music.  AIC's two previous albums (Facelift and SAP) had been underappreciated by the rock scene and it wasn't until the single \\"Would\\" debuted on the soundtrack to the movie \\"Singles\\" that people began taking a second look at Alice in Chains and the rest is history.  Rock music changed and gained back some of its harder/darker edge which had been missing for a long time.  Layne Staley's angry, tortured lyrics accompanied by Jerry Cantrell's guitar playing and supporting vocals propelled this band to superstar status.  Some of more outstanding tracks were \\"Junkhead\\", \\"Down in a Hole\\", \\"Angry Chair\\", \\"Them Bones\\" and \\"Would?\\"  The material deals mostly with a dark fixation on death and on drug abuse.  Sadly enough this was ultimately the band's undoing as Staley died of a lethal drug overdose in 2002.  Pick up this album and be sure to check out some of AIC's other great CDs.
0684823454|5.0|This 372 page long book would be good, but no more, if it wasn't for the first 40-or-so pages, which are a gem.  The book covers the first 30 years of Churchill's life and the first forty pages cover his childhood. Although Churchill had a miserable childhood - his father was distant,  his mother more interested in lovers than in her son, and he was bullied at boarding school - Churchill narrates his story with unsurpassed wit and without any hard feelings for the ones that failed him. Some passages, like the description of how he was grappling with the beast called maths, are just hilarious. The first forty pages alone make this book a must read. In the rest of the book, the most interesting part is the story of Churchill's capture by the Boers and escape.  You don't need to be interested in Churchill, the statesman, to like this book. Here he is at his most human and disarming.
B000957O7S|5.0|I love hitch it the best cute sweet movie ever. It made me realize how much I have to appreciated my boyfriend. It also teach me how to see when a boy is trying to get me just to do sex or pay around with me.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I was dumbfounded by this movie. The black and white film with the splashes of color mixed in was fantastic. The movie was very reminiscent of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" in the way that it begins with the end (sort of) and skips around, finally bringing everything together at the end. There are also scenes that will definitely bring to mind \\"Kill Bill\\". If the movie itself doesn't grab you, the way in which it was filmed WILL. This has fast become one of my all-time favorite movies, destined, I'm sure, to become a cult classic. I absolutely recommend it!
B0000039PW|5.0|this album brings up memories of when i was starting high school and hip hop found its way into my life. unlike a few albums from this time period (ie. all eyes on me - which i love) it doesnt sound dated. i have to admit that eventho i gave this review a 5 star rating, there are a few tracks where the production is a little wack but biggie's flow takes your attention and ends up completely saving these tracks. most of the album is very well produced and big's flow is insanely tight and smooth. <br /> <br />i still cant believe that bad boy release such a quality effort, kinda funny when you think about it - hip hop would of been better off if puffy took them bullets instead ;)
1400034779|4.0|This story is full of such good humour and general \\"niceness\\" that it stays with you for days after you've read it. Precious Ramotswe is the survivor of an abusive marriage and was the mother of a baby who lived for only five days after marrying against her fathers' advice. She devoted herself to caring for Daddy, as she called him, for the rest of his life, agreeing with his plans for her to start her own business. Daddy had visions of her running a butcher shop or some other lucrative business, but, instead, Precious decides to follow in the shadow of one of her heroines, Agatha Christie, and sets up the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency, complete with an office, a secretary and a tiny white van for following and surveillance work. Clients begin to trickle in slowly with Precios being asked mainly to follow errant husbands, but, as her reputation for common sense and reliable work grows, she is soon asked to consult on crimes of theft, suspected witchcraft and unlicensed medical practices. As a size 22, generously built African lady, Precious is an unlikely PI, but this quirky book has such charm that I hope to find the sequel soon.
B000002J1M|5.0|I personally think that this is the band's best album. \\"Selling\\" was excellent, but this overcomes that; and \\"Lamb\\" was also awesome, but that was mostly a Gabriel-driven album, and not a band-driven. This album has each member driving their instruments home. <br /> <br />\\"Watcher of the Skies\\" begins with a slow organ solo, and as it fades at 2 minutes, the band comes in at full force. Excellent song. \\"Time Table\\" is filler, i skip it every time i listen to the album. \\"Get 'em Out By Friday\\" is also awesome, with Gabriel acting as multiple characters. \\"Can Utility\\" is just as equal with \\"Time Table\\", just to get the running time to 50 minutes. \\"Horizon's\\" is Hackett at his best, although short. <br /> <br />\\"Supper's Ready\\" is the pinnacle of the album, and IMO, is the band's best song ever. Along with Yes' \\"Close to the Edge\\" (18 min), ELP's Tarkus (20 min), this is this Genesis' single track rock suite, clocking at 22 min. It has 7 parts, and is a rollercoaster of sweetness; \\"Lover's Leap\\" is  a beautiful piece in its own right, \\"Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man\\" is about a man who tricks people for money, \\"...Band of Merry Men\\" is about viewing a battle, \\"How I Dare Be So Beautiful\\" is boring, \\"Willow Farm\\" is a humorous piece, dropping a reference to Nursery Cryme and other joking lyrics, \\"Apocalypse in 9/8\\" is my personal favorite, with Mike and Steve on bass/guitar pumping out a kick ass riff, while Tony does an ELP-esque keyboard solo, and the climactic \\"As Sure as Eggs is Eggs\\", closing the suite. <br /> <br />This is their best IMO, so try this, \\"Selling\\", \\"Lamb\\", or \\"Trick\\" if your starting off.
B000058DFO|5.0|I owned this vinyl ablum many many years ago and found it, as I remembered, uplifting. Inspired by the memory I purchased the CD. Now I remember what was so good about it, it is really a happening sound no matter how old you are or how long ago this was made. Timeless music that just gets you feeling so good is how I best describe this CD. Funny I have over 600 CDs and with my 5 stacker CD player this one always has a reserved spot for parties...ummm, no matter what other new great funky CDs are purchased, Jamiroquai or Incognito (Adventures in Black Sunshine takes 2nd reserved spot)this still one of my favourites. Beautiful music, beautiful woman.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie will be a classic - with the lush scenery, the breath-taking music and lyrics, and a superb cast!  <br />Emmy Rossum does a perfect job, and her voice is superb.  <br />Gerard Butler, however, makes this movie. His presentation of the Phantom is so intense and sensual, his heartfelt renditions of his musical numbers so haunting and beautiful, that women of all ages, all over the country are wishing they were Christine and, as Amanda Richards so Perfectly said in her review: \\"would have to be dragged out of that boudoire with wild horses and a bulldozer\\". He portrays such a deep love, such longing and tender vulnerability, that you have to wonder what she was thinking when she left.   <br />Kudos to this fabulous actor who has so many women wishing for such a man as the Phantom, regardless of his disfigurement. I predict that Mr. Butler will be around for a long, long time, and meanwhile, I'm going looking for more of his movies.

0399152717|4.0|The latest in the Kurt Austin series gives us a little of what we've grown accustomed to and a few new things, as well.  It begins near the end of World War II, when an Austrian scientist, Dr. Kovacs, who has been forced to work for the Nazis, escapes his captors with the aid of a mysterious man named Karl Schroeder.<br /><br />Kurt Austin, Joe Zavala, and Paul and Gamay Trout are called to action when rogue waves, giant whirlpools, and crazy Orcas all seem to have their roots in human interference with nature.  They find themselves on the trail of a dangerous group of well-funded anarchists, and Kurt must go to the rescue of lovely Dr. Karla Janos, the illustrious Dr. Kovacs's granddaughter who came into the crosshairs of the anarchists because they believe she knows something about the scientific formulas her grandfather created for the Nazis.  The anarchists are poised to create a polar shift, which they believe will toss the world into a communications nightmare.  The NUMA Special Assignments Team, however, believes it will cause the end of the world, and it's up to Kurt and his crew to save the day.<br /><br />This book took a slight departure from others in the series by focusing a great deal on the villains, who were separated into three different factions.  But, while showing us how truly cold and evil the villains were, it gave less attention to the Trouts, who are some of my favorite characters.  Their role in this book was disappointingly small, with the attention that might have gone to their exploits instead focusing on Karl Schroeder and the villains.  Kurt's exploits were as dashing as ever, complete with a Dirk Pitt-style car chase in one of Pitt's classic cars.  While the story was compelling and fun to read, it seemed to lack the gripping excitement of most Cussler novels.  Instead, it starred a richer cast of characters well woven into the back story.  While not the best of the Kurt Austin series, it's still a very good book.
0316172324|3.0|Unlike many of the unpopular reviews Blink has received on Amazon, I enjoyed it. While much of the information about our ability to make snap judgements versus using logic is not ground breaking information, Gladwell uses interesting examples and case studies to support his points; he successfully demonstrates how our intuition can be both useful in making decisions, yet harmful and ridden with stereotypes.      The experiment which includes subjects who were asked to judge strangers' characters by visiting their dorm rooms (subjects observed belongings, judged how clean the room was, etc) was fascinating; the strangers who viewed the rooms were more accurate in judging character than the closest friends of the dorm inhabitants.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|I won't go into detail here. I'll only say that this is QUALITY production at its BEST!!! There isn't a SECOND of bad acting, directing, or cinematogrophy in the maxi-series. This is the benchmark by which all other TV productions should be held.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul McCartney returns to the songwriting we've always known him capable of in Chaos. \\"A Fine Line\\" is a Lady Madonna-style uptempo piano track and a very effective opener. Paul builds on his greatest strengths here writing some amazing ballads with the effortlessly catchy melodies that we've found him, above all songwriters, most capable of. \\"Jenny Wren\\" is a wonderful guitar/duduk ballad in the tradition of Blackbird/Mother Nature's Son. When Paul's second verse begins \\"She saw poverty breaking up her home...\\" you know he has more to say than has been traditionally accused of. Other absolutely amazing ballads are \\"Too Much Rain\\" and \\"Anyway.\\" \\"Laugh when your eyes are burning,\\" begins \\"Too Much Rain\\" and we are once again reminded that this is an album on which Paul has something real and urgent to say. He brings out feelings that he had long learnt to bottle up though the great tradition of character songs Paul is legendary for. This is a darker album lyrically but still, do expect some romance from the man who wrote \\"Yesterday.\\" He is still Paul McCartney after all and does not try to be soemthing that he is not- he just takes more care when saying it. <br />Look out for \\"Promise to you Girl\\"! It is an amazing song! This is the album I had been waiting for from Paul and I couldn't be more thrilled and proud that at 63 Paul is ever the master tunesmith.
B000002H6C|4.0|This is the last great thrash album that Metallica made.  The Black Album was the last good Metallica album but it can't be considered Thrash per say.  This is also the first album with Bassist Jason Newsted, after the tragic death of Cliff Burton.  Jason doesn't matter too much on this album as you can not make out the bass at all.  The production is not as bad as people say it is but it seems as if the bass was forgotten in the final mix of the album.  My favorite song here has got to be One.  Yes, that sounds clich as a lot of people say it is their favorite but it truly is a beautiful song that my skin shiver every time I hear it.  For those who don't know, it's about a soldier from WWI who stepped on a landmine and when he comes to, he's armless, legless, blind, deaf vegetable that can't communicate with the outside world and tell them to simply end his suffering, his hell, and just kill him.  It's truly a great song.  Even with this great song there are a few problems.  I find it difficult to listen to the whole album and not become bored from time to time.  The average song length is 6 1/2 minutes.  The title track is a bit repetitive unlike the title tracks from Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning.  The song To Live is to Die is mainly a long instrumental that was partially written by Cliff Burton before he died and I'm guessing he also wrote the four sentences of lyrics too.  It's good, but not Metallica's best instrumental overall.  There is the strange song The Frayed ends of Insanity which opens with a chant from the Wizard of Oz, these guys definitely had a sense of humor but I can't take it seriously.  Other songs like Blackened and Dyer's Eve are similar to One, in that they are perfect.  Lars was never a great drummer but Dyer's Eve is definitely his best song and he does an excellent job.  On the Import there is the cover song The Prince as a bonus track (you can find it on Garage Inc. too).  This is a great album but does not top Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets in my opinion, but does succeed in coming close.  If you want the real true form of Metallica and not some St. Anguish , then definitely pick up this album along with Kill `Em All, Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets.  The Black Album on the other hand is good but I feel is optional.  After that though, don't even bother.  Hoped this helped.
B000AA305M|5.0|David Gray has been one of my favorite new artists of the new decade.  Many people tried before him to mix folk with electronic music and failed miserably, but with the release of White Ladder, Gray seamlessly mixed the two together effortlessly.  Gray continued with the equally great A New Day at Midnight.  Now he's back with his latest release, Life in Slow Motion. <br /> <br />The album starts off earnest enough with the lush sounding Alibi with the piano taking center stage while background strings slowly build to accompany the piece.  It's a downer of a song and maybe not the best way to start the album off.  Thing get more upbeat with the next song, The One I Love.  The song doesn't quite stand up to his pervious love songs like Be Mine or This Years Love, but it is good nonetheless. <br /> <br />Vocally, Gray show more range on this album such as on From Here You Can Almost See the Sea, he reaches into his falsetto as if he was fronting Coldplay.  Musically, Gray has veered away from the techno infused beats focusing more this album on the piano and strings then on drums.  Ain't No Love even starts with some synthesizer that makes you think you're listening to a song by The Killers. <br /> <br />David Gray is as lyrically as strong as in the past and this album the highlight there is Hospital Food.  Another look at the agonizing wait many people have while a loved one is in the hospital, \\"Tell me something I don't already know.\\"  In the end, if you are a fan of David Gray's, you will love this album too.  If you are not already a fan, you may want to start with White Ladder and work you're way up to Life in Slow Motion.

B00003CXA6|5.0|Based on late author Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize-winning Civil War novel THE KILLER ANGELS, GETTYSBURG brings the bloodiest battle ever fought on American soil to life on the screen in one of the most moving, epic films ever made. The movie covers the brutal three-day conflict fought at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from July 1st through July 3rd, 1863 mainly through the experiences of three incredible men: Confederate General Robert E. Lee (Martin Sheen), Confederate Lieutenant General James Longstreet (Tom Berenger), and Union Colonel Joshua L. Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels). Through these men and others, GETTYSBURG tells the story of this decisive engagement of the Civil War perfectly.<br /><br />The whole cast's performances are stellar throughout the entire movie. Jeff Daniels' portrayal of the professor-turned-soldier Colonel Chamberlain stands out as one of the best performances in the film, along with Tom Berenger's excellent General Longstreet. And though Martin Sheen may not completely capture the physical characteristics of General Lee, he certainly captures his spirit. The minor roles are also incredibly well done, from Stephen Lang's Confederate General George Pickett to Kevin Conway's Union Sergeant \\"Buster\\" Kilrain. Each actor's similarities and historical accuracy-minded devotion to his character gives the film an incredible authenticity.<br /><br />One of the many things that sets GETTYSBURG apart from so many other war movies is its amazing attention to historical accuracy. Not only was the movie filmed entirely on the actual battlefield locations in Pennsylvania, but the film also benefits hugely from how historically correct the uniforms, weapons, and sets are. Its use of over 4,000 Civil War reenactors makes its epic battles far more realistic, powerful, and moving than any movie could ever accomplish using computerization.<br /><br />Every one of the battle scenes is astoundingly well-done and realistic. From Union General John Buford's first encounter with Rebel infantry to Colonel Chamberlain's courageous stand atop Little Round Top to the massive, climactic, heavy-with-emotion Pickett's Charge, each battle tells its own story, develops characters, and flows with energy and heroism.<br /><br />The soundtrack to the movie is a glorious musical accomplishment. Composed by Randy Edelman, its combination of epic battle themes and classical Civil War-era music not only conveys the feel and emotion of the film perfectly, but also stands alone as the best soundtrack ever composed for a war movie.<br /><br />With its spectacular cast, wonderful script, glorious soundtrack, epic battle sequences, constant devotion to historical accuracy, and more, GETTYSBURG delivers an unrepeatable, awe-inspiring portrayal of the courageous men of the Union and the Confederacy who fought in the Civil War.to Colonel Chamberlain's courageous stand atop Little Round Top to the massive, climactic, heavy-with-emotion Pickett's Charge, each battle tells its own story, develops characters, and flows with energy and heroism.

B0009I7O7U|5.0|That dang snooze button. I tell ya. It got me good on this one. I'd been hearing from everybody about John Legend for so long but just never picked up his CD. I knew he could play (\\"Ordinary People\\"). I knew he could blow (\\"Ordinary People\\"). After seeing phenomenal television performances over the past few months (his duet with Stevie Wonder on, you guessed it, \\"Ordinary People\\"), I finally decided to \\"Get Lifted\\" and can't stop rocking this joint. Of course \\"Ordinary People\\" is a masterpiece, simply stated. A man, his piano and the truth about relationships.   <br /> <br />This debut has a smooth flow to it with funky rythym and bass grooves a la Kanye West for most of the album. \\"Get Lifted\\" is one such track with great melody, harmony, a slick guitar riff that adds a taste of reggae and head-bobbing beat. Definitely one for the repeat button. \\"Used to Love U\\" is another straight up jam with its in your face message of missing that well when its run dry.  The messages stream from infidelity with \\"She Don't Have to Know\\", to ending his player ways on \\"I Can Change\\", and taking it home as family members add vocals on \\"Don't Have to Change\\" in the end.   <br /> <br />With a voice that brings raw soul,passion, and urgency to the listener's ear, John Legend seems to be channeling the old school masters like Marvin, Stevie and Donny. Yet, this old soul carries a new sound and style all his own. If he continues on this path, Legend will leave a legacy that is truly masterful.   <br />I gave 4 out of 5 for the simple fact that I wanted LONGER songs and MORE songs.

The College Dropout by Kanye West may be one of the best debut albums i have ever heard. With appearences by Jay-Z, Common, Syleena Johnson, and more this album was sure to be a hit. Including many hits such as \\"Through the Wire\\", \\"All Falls Down\\", and the award winning \\"Jesus Walks\\", this should be a must buy if you're into rap, or hip-hop. He may come of cocky at times, but he's definately got the talent to back it up, making him one of my all time favorite rappers.    1. Intro- N/A  2. We Don't Care- Amazing song. The perfect lead off song after the intro to show you what Kanye West is all about. 5/5  3. Graduation Day- Way too short. 3/5  4. All Falls Down- Featuring Syleena Johnson- Another great song, featuring one of the business's best female singers Syleena Johnson singing the chorus. Is it possible for that to not be a hit?  5. I'll Fly Away- Not one of my favorite songs, too short.  6. Spaceship- A nice, softer song, good in depth lasting around five minutes.  7. Jesus Walks- The Grammy Nominated, award winning \\"Jesus Walks\\" is arguably the best song on the album depending on what you like.  8. Never Let Me Down- Kanye gets just the right amount of help from superstars Jay-Z, and J.Ivy. This is another great song with another very catchy chorus.  9. Get Em High- A little help from Common and Talib Kweli makes this another perfect song to add to the debut.  10. Work Out Plan- N/A  11. The New Work Out Plan- Definetly a different and new side to Kanye, other reviews were saying this was the song that ruined it, but I for one believe this makes the cd, well original.  12. Slow Jamz- Probably the softer side to Kanye, definetly not the bad one though. Another great sonng to add to this album.  13. Breathe In Breathe Out- Another average-good song.  14. School Spirit Skit#1- N/A  15. School Spirit- A pretty good song.  16. Lil Jimmy Skit- N/A  17. Two Words- Not my favorite but pretty good.  18. Through The Wire- The first single on this album, a very catchy song with AMAZING beats, AMAZING lyrics, and AMAZING rhythm.   19. Family Business- A touching song.  20. Last Call- The thirteen minute lasting ending, and thank you's can be made this good only by one man. Kanye West.    Overall this is an one amazing album, which anyone who has taste in this kind of music should get. After hearing this review i honestly hope i have helped persuade you to get this album.    PIRATE
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This CD is truly a masterpiece featuring the heavenly voices of Celtic women performers. The melodies and music are truly the best of contemporary and traditional sounds. A definite must have for the music collector.
B0002OERI0|2.0|I'm just a reviewer that might buy this album and came looking for other reviews.  To the person who said Green Day is a much better band than Pearl Jam, what are you smoking? Id rather be trapped on a desert island with Pearl Jams greatest hits album alone than every Green Day album and Green Days greatest hits album combined, at least Pearl Jam act their age
0743435753|5.0|I am never disapointed when I read anything with Honor Harrington in it. Whenever I start reading it's hard to put the book down. I'm sorry that I am a new comer to the series. Flag in Exile was the only one book I needed to complete my set.  Thank you Mr. Weber for hours of pure entertainment.
B000003337|4.0|so much promise. this cd is a really neat item that brings to life the early parts of randy's career. Too bad they wont release both full albums.... a highlight is his solo \\"laughing gas\\" <br /> <br />CAUTION: SPOILER _----------------------------------------------- <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But the solo is a LOT like the one he plays on the live tribute CD during Suicide Solution. Not exactly though. the solo also seems to contain some early workings of the riff from crazy train and an early version of Dee. Pretty neat stuff. Four stars only because its not both complete albums
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|What a fun movie! It's sexy, dorky, cool, hip, wild, fun and definitely worth seeing! Yes, it may be a tad corny at times, but it really is a well-done musical. This movie is probably enjoyed most by:  <br /> <br />1) fans of Johnny Depp...if you consider yourself a true Johnny Depp fan, then you HAVE to see this movie. You won't regret it.  <br />2) fans of Grease (although this movie is more of a satire of the 50s)  <br />3) anyone who loves great music!  <br /> <br />This movie will have you up out of your chair singing and dancing!! The music by far is the best part (besides Johnny). My favorite is the sultry \\"Please, Mr. Jailer.\\" You'll be singing it all day. In addition to all the awesome songs, there's romance, action, comedy, and a bunch of kids who love bein bad cuz it sure feels good!  <br /> <br />The plot of this movie is basically the Squares (good kids) versus the Drapes (bad kids). Allison is a square, but she can't help but have feelings for the ultra-cool, ultra-hip, ultra-adorable Cry Baby Walker (Johnny), who is known for his ability to cry one single teardrop. Allison finds herself having a wonderful time with Cry Baby and his gang (Hatchet-Face is my favorite character...you have to see her to believe it), but the other Squares can't stand to see Allison become a Drape. This leads to the ultimate battle between the nerds and the cool kids. Later Cry Baby winds up in jail...can Allison convince the judge that he is innocent?  <br /> <br />You'll have to buy it to find out. So, if you're 15 or older (it does include the F word, and a LOT of intense and sloppy tongue-kissing), you LOVE Johnny Depp, you love great 50s music, or you just adore having fun, then this movie is undoubtedly for you.

B000AA4M9U|4.0|Growing up my Mom had a fortune cookie message taped above her desk that said \\"to stay youthful, stay useful.\\" B.B. King is a spry 80, and you can hear it in his voice. He may not hit the notes he used to, but his passion and love for performing hasn't diminished at all. The performance of \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" with Eric Clapton is an inspired rendition, teacher and student reuniting to compare notes. The lead track \\"Early In The Morning\\" features a robust exchange between Van Morrison and B.B. that is easily one of 80's most notable highlights. Representing the more recent graduates, John Mayer and B.B. play wonderfully off one another on Leon Russell's classic \\"Hummingbird\\", which builds into a crescendo, complete with subtle string arrangements, that lifts the song to glorious heights. Other highlights include old friend Bobby Bland reminiscing on Willie Nelson's \\"Funny How Time Slips Away,\\" and the rollicking boogie woogie throwback \\"Rock This House\\" with Sir Elton John.  Though the ladies are only sparsely represented on \\"80\\", Sheryl Crow's duet with B.B. on \\"Need Your Love So Bad\\" brings out the best in both, as B.B. cooly croons \\"...well hello there\\" to sultry Sheryl.  <br /> <br />For a man on the cusp of his 80th year, you wouldn't know it - I hope I sound and look so good!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|it was a very good movie. it had a lot of stupid fun stuff. it was a good movie becase it did have no point of it. It was so may funny things. IT will be funnier if you see it with a friend. it will be more because you will be laughing at the movie and out of no where you'll start laughing for no reason.
B00004STPT|5.0|Ok, ill make the review short, if u like what i wrote u can tell me and i ll give ya some more.    Long story short : I'm a huge music fan, let alone Movie Soundtracks, especially John Barry. (I find John Williams f.i. to be a genius but somewhat bland at times)    Anyways. I came across Holst's the planets and it reminded me of Gladiator just like the review says. So i got me the Gladiator OST and i ve been listening to it ever since, by doing work, reading, playing computer games whatever. That means endless hours of this masterpiece.    It truly is a flawless suite u just CRAVE to listen to over again and again. Gets under your skin too.      My point     a. Obviously is that it's better than the Movie (sorry Mr. Scott). The Soundtrack has more emotions than the movie itself !! U could turn the picture off and still be satisfied with the ride (except for some key scenes). Maybe because the movie isnt as bold as is \\"Alexander\\" for instance.    b. If u like this epic soundtrack i recommand you Vangelis' Alexander (from Oliver Stone). The two really should have paired up for this last particular movie making it the greatest soundtrack of all time.    c. IF U LIKE Lisa Gerrard's performance on \\"Now we are Free\\" and such. then GO GET \\"Man on fire\\" (By ridleys brother Tony Scott), it features quasi the same type of song at the end except it's way better -not to mention this movie is also a masterpiece in the first place-. It will bring you to tears folks. **remember this when u listen to Lisa's work on this one, you will think about my review and thank me forever lol**      Hope there was a lot of useful information in those few lines :)    Anyway remember : This Soundtrack is bigger than the movie
B000AL730O|3.0|I've had the album over a week thanks to a posting of it online. I DO intend to buy it...(    As a whole, the album is growing on me. When I first heard it, I thought it was pretty slow and dull. However, after repeated listens, it's \\"getting better all the time\\". I miss Paul's bass playing that seemed to re-emerge on the Driving Rain album. It's not here.(The bass playing and \\"About You\\" were the best things on that album). I also am not into Paul's lead guitar playing on this new album. The solos he played on the original McCartney album were a lot more focused and had a better sound.    \\"Fine Line\\" is ok but kind of pointless and lyrically dull. Very much like \\"Flaming Pie\\". The plodding piano gets old, especially in the bridge. The song doesn't really say anything but I guess it's ok for a poppish single that will go nowhere thanks to a music-buying public that can only seem to focus on \\"Bling\\", \\"T*ts\\", and \\"A$$\\" (is anybody else sick of that stuff being rammed down our throats??).    \\"How Kind of You\\"- boring track. This song could really use a decent chorus...    \\"Jenny Wren\\"- WHY are people saying this is such a great track? It sounds like \\"Put it There\\" from Flowers in the Dirt. The latter is the better track. Granted, there's the finger picking and solo acoustic guitar that produced PIT, \\"Blackbird\\", \\"Mother Nature's Son\\", etc. but lyrically, \\"Jenny Wren\\" doesn't really deliver much. It's ok.    \\"At the Mercy\\"- Ok, who else was waiting for a \\"Mersey\\" play on words here? The song doesn't do much for me at all. It's in a minor, dark vein and just doesn't bring much to the party. The chorus is good but the verses are just kind of meandering...    \\"Friends to Go\\"- Paul has said he wrote this with George Harrison on his mind. It shows. It's a cool little track. Lyrically it's decent and it's a good tune with a good chorus. Nice one Paul.    \\"English Tea\\"- Ok, sorry, but I love this song. It's SO reminiscent of the White Album's \\"Honey Pie\\" and Pepper's \\"When I'm64\\" without stepping into Venus and Mars' \\"You Gave Me the Answer\\" territory. This song is in fact the most \\"Beatley\\" to me. I love it. I read a journalist say it's too much of a \\"twee\\" song. It's supposed to be you dope! It's a great song.    \\"Too Much Rain\\" is one of the best solo McCartney tracks that I've ever heard. The lyrics are great, uplifting, and the music is also good. Listen to it, it's a great track. Even though it's kind of a \\"cheer up\\" song and Paul is kind of known for those (and gets slammed for it constantly- not everybody's curt cobain!), it's really a great song. The first song of his to give me chills since \\"Here Today\\" from Tug of War.This song alone is worth the purchase. He should've played this for the hurricane victims instead of the \\"hit\\" single...   THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM.    \\"A Certain Softness\\"- too loungy for me. Reminds me of \\"Distractions\\" from Flowers in the Dirt. It's ok, but just kind of sleepy.    \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\"- Think \\"Footprints\\" from Press to Play. Very similar musically. I DO like these lyrics. It's nice when McCartney channels anger into his songs like \\"Angry\\" also from PtP. I think I would've preferred this to be a faster track. However, the slowness of it make you pay attention to the lyrics which are decent.    \\"Follow Me\\"- Paul's been playing this one live for the past year. Reminds me a bit of \\"One of These Days\\" from McCartney II but it's a bit faster and has more of a point. Nice little love songs with a cool string quartet (?) brought into the bridge. Good song.    \\"Promise to You Girl\\"- Quirky track. The main body sounds like \\"Keep Under Cover\\" from Pipes of Peace. There are some nice harmonies at the beginning, but Paul does a refrain of them later with a really out of place top harmony that kind of wrecks them. It's a musically interesting song... until the guitar solo. The solo sounds like a demo lead. It's horrible. Not even in tune. I wish that Rusty from Paul's band would've played it. In fact,Paul SHOULD have used his band on this album, just brought them in on the end to overdub rather than be part of the creative process which is what the producer intended.    \\"This Never Happened Before\\" Reminds me of some of Paul's movie soundtrack numbers like \\"Same Time Next Year\\". If you like that, you'll like this. It doesn't do anything for me. Sounds like something for the old folks.    \\"Anyway\\"- Um, Paul, \\"People Get Ready\\" called. They want their music back. Having said that, this one's ok for a slow, love song. I prefer \\"Your Loving Flame\\" from Driving Rain.     At the end of the last track there's a lot of jamming and stuff. SOME of this would've made for cool tracks.    Oh, note to the producer- You should've let Paul rock a bit more. He can write great rockers if you let him.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Four girls with beautiful voices that combine Irish and traditional songs with an excellent orchestral backup. I also enjoyed the fiddle player who also appeared with the Irish show Riverdance. Looking forward to hearing more work from this fine group of singers and musicians. <br />Bob S.

1559408855|4.0|Firsty, this DVD is a must have for any collector. Secondly, I would just like to correct the edition details provided above. This DVD is not Region 1, it is Region 0, like all early Criterion releases. It will play on any DVD player in any country. It is also not rated NC-17. The Criterion uncut DVD version of Salo has no MPAA rating, and it never has.
B000002UCN|4.0|One thing is for sure, these are great songs from George Harrison, and I believe they hold up next to the Lennon and McCartney songs as well. This collection is wonderful for what's included, but quite incomplete as his later work is absent. Seeing that most people have the Beatles songs already, I would enjoy a solo only collection. Hopefully we get an \\"Essential\\" disc or something like it soon. That would include the last half of this album, plus \\"Beware Of Darkness\\", a third of the songs from \\"Cloud Nine\\", hopefully some Traveling Wilburys, and a few extras. Or this album would work great with a package called \\"The Rest of George Harrison\\". I'll be right there to buy it.
B000002J1O|5.0|Genesis was a great band in the 70's and 80's. They are so talented and creative. It's simple, Genesis Sound make an Age for the Rock
0515123447|5.0|Reacher is a good guy, in a very good way. Justice and doing the right thing is what he's about. He's like a mix of Ludlum's Jason Bourne, Eisler's John Rain, and Stark's infamous bad guy, Parker. If you've ever read Stark's, Parker novels, you know what I mean. Reacher doesn't really explain himself to anyone about anything, unless he has to, which is exasctly like Parker. He resembles Eisler's, John Rain because he's totaly lethal, and a very skilled killer. He's part Ludlum's, Jason Bourne because he used to be involved in military. Like all of these characters Reacher Kicks some major ass with the best of 'em<br /><br />Lee Child is very good at keeping you guessing, and not making you wait too long for some action. If you like Stark, Ludlum, or Eisler, check out the guns on Child!
B00006JDS4|1.0|Based on a true story?  If this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy.  Did anyone witness this woman being raped?  People are just going on a murder's word that she was rape by these men.    I made two previous attempts to try to explain my point but as I started reading the other reviews I found one that explains everything I was trying to say.  One review stated the following:    I gave this 5 stars because men who rape women deserve an awful death.    Why?  When is it justifiable for a man to take revenge by killing a woman?  This movie was a fantasy and I feel sorry for a person who thinks it represent reality.  To state that anyone should have the right to take the law into his or her own hands is a crime.  To defend your self is one thing but to intentionally want to kill is simply murder.  The fictional female character (not the actor) in that story should be sent to prison for life for her alone deciding to be the Judge, Jury and Executioner.  I also despise movies where the man does the same thing.  But, it is only a movie.    I gave this movie 1 star because you have to give it one.  Yet, that one review makes my point about the majority of these kind of movies.  Movies should stick more to reality when they are doing a film about something that could happen.    If this movie really is based on a true story than it is sick.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Surprisingly differentiated and interesting characters, interesting setting, generally entertaining plots.  It's a shame the series was cancelled.  Hopefully the upcoming movie (\\"Serenity\\") will give it a new lease on life...
B00003CX9E|1.0|Who needs Sominex??  Just pop this movie into your DVD or VCR player and you'll be asleep in five minutes!!  Trust me!!
0195102681|5.0|I like the book, it's certainly rigorous and explains the concepts reasonably well, at an advanced level. I have little to add to the other reviewers' comments on that. <br /> <br />I'd like to add that this textbook is definitely the most carefully produced I own. Even though it's in its first ed. there are very few typos. More importantly, the layout is very convincing. Even complex graphs are are clearly and beautifully drawn, the typesetting is 100% consistent throughout the book.  <br /> <br />OK, you might say what the heck? But I regrettably have to admit that I currently spend as much time with \\"MWG\\" as with my girlfriend. So, I learnt to appreciate that it looks as good as she does (in relative terms: for a book compared to other books as her compared to other women, that is). All of you who still remember Greene's 4th ed (the blue letters...) will agree with me that a well-produced book is something to which some attention should be paid!  <br />
B00006BTCA|5.0|I saw Interpol live in Denver on Sunday, 9/11, and have their sound and live experience fresh in my soul. <br /> <br />I went through school listening to Joy Division, Smiths, Cure and other depressives of the era. So, Interpol produce melancholy music that appeals to the depressive and the depressed; so what? It's not sentimental, a la Coldplay, that's for sure. It's derivative; so what? All music derives from a historical lineage. <br /> <br />Put the lights out (excuse the pun), roll a number (or just roll) and feel the music; if this doesn't strike your soul then ask yourself where your's went.
B000AL730O|5.0|I've been a staunch Macca fan for years and have enjoyed just about everything he's done, but this album is a joy.  It's intimate and melancholic - yet somehow uplifting - and it almost seems as though Paul is singing to you.  It doesn't sound like McCARTNEY (his 1970 debut), but it does recall its charms.  At 63, Paul can STILL surprise us.  There aren't any obvious hits here and it takes a few listens to reveal itself, but it plays all the way through as a great album.  Should you buy it?  YES.
0060763280|5.0|I liked this book because it gave me a plan of action to take and the plan seemed to be exactly what I needed to change my spending habits. I also found it easy to read and understand. I highly recommend it for anyone who is serious about making simple changes that will lead to financial freedom in their lives. The book really held my attention from the first page to the last page.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Ok, so perhaps I was driven to write this review less by the urge to share that I really enjoyed this album, and more by my frustration of the amount of negative reviews that criticize not on the basis of quality, but on failure to \\"live up\\" to some other band people believe constitutes great music. In the case of Muse, I will not deny that Radiohead is a fantastic band; it is, so I cannot understand why so many people bash Muse because Matthew Ballamy sounds like Thom Yorke. Radiohead has indeed inspired some of Muse's style, but how is this a bad thing? Does this mean that the band is talentless, and has no right to make music? (i.e. is garbage?) All musicians today have been influenced in one way or another by musicians of the past...it's why new genres don't all of the sudden explode onto the music scene; they are developed gradually. <br /> <br />I think it is unfair to believe that there exist some bands that epitomize musical brilliance. Even the greats have had their failings, and Radiohead is no exception. Muse isn't some kind of clone. For example. I have never heard piano incorporated with driving rock in quite the same way this group does it. The style is reminiscent of Rachmaninoff, and the fact that it doesn't even sound out of place is amazing. <br /> <br />The way I see it, with all the rich and diverse music that has been composed through-out history, it has/will become nearly impossible for modern bands to be considered completely original, as inevitably they will sound like someone or something else. If we were to dismiss them because of this, then I suppose it's the end of music as we know it...so hopefully it never happens. <br /> <br />Put simply, this cd rocked. That's my opinion, of course not everyone is going to agree because we all have our own personal tastes (obviously!) I'll admit, and the reason I give it 4.5 stars: it has its slower moments, the vocals can be a bit too whiny at times, and the lyrics often lack substance. However, I never got the impression that it was some kind of knock-off; a mere uninspired imitation. I could listen to this album over and over and still not get bored. Rock on.
B000068QY7|5.0|The way Liam Gallager`s voice, leader of the smashing British rock band Oasis is mixed up with the slow Tune of the guittar makes  the perfect song. His way of giving life ti the song by singing in a depress way makes you feel like what he is singing is actually your view of life, actually like an advice to you. Not to stop mentioning the chorus with the help of the guittar and the instrument`s solo just make you wish you could have 2 tickets in first place on their show. The Gallager twins among the rest of the band recreate a whole but depress song only in its melody, cause the lyrix is quite the contrarie,  the voices wich follow the main leader in all the chorus are melodic in a rough way, the way Oasis plays all its songs; Once again i really recommend this band with its unique way of making exellent songs.
B000AL730O|5.0|Chaos and creation is quite simply the best album mccartney has produced since band on the run.This is a grown up album for grown up people.Every song on the album flows beautifully, from the dark and atmospheric feel of Riding to vanity fair to the poignent and ultimatly optimstic Too much rain. This album is a must for any serious music fan.
0385510454|1.0|I was very disappointed by this book - it starts up fairly interesting when the situation of Backman's pardon is nicely painted for the reader, but it is all downhill from there. There is so much description of the Italian sights, the Italian way of life, the Italian meals etc. etc. that I got the impression of reading a travel-diary. Was Grisham vacationing in Italy and made a book out of it?   At times there is an attempt to bring in some excitement, for example when the different [...]-teams are being brought into the game, but that never really amounts to anything.  The ending is left somewhat open and is rather weak.  All in all a big disappointment.
0385504209|3.0|Placed firmly between fact and fiction, the DaVinci Code by Dan Brown attempts to draw the reader in with a loose tapestry which spans both, and tries to draw on each element to keep your attention. While the book is intriguing on one level, it is deficient in another. It draws you in for one reason, then casts you out for another. It starts fast, and finishes faster. The story moves in 2 different planes, one of them satisfying and the other a myriad of absurdity. In the end, neither aspect is really all that satisfying because they have to coexist together to form the book as a whole.<br /><br />I read this book because my mother bought it for me. She bought it for me because it was the rage at the time. She read it, her friend read it, her friend's friend read it, and so on. I don't question how or why a book ends up on top of my \\"to read\\" pile. I just read it, thankful for the opportunity to walk down a road I might not have otherwise walked down. This is exactly that, a book I never would have read left to my own devices.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book. But it is nowhere near as good as general perception paints it to be. Frankly, I think this is one of the most overrated books in recent memory. I rarely read bestsellers because I think the general reading public tends towards trash novels that aren't worth the time spent reading them. Is this one of those novels? I can't say that. But it's not a 5-star book either. It's a decent book which intrigued me in terms of historical perspective but which suffered mightily in trying to tie it together. This would have been better served as a sort of Dummy's Guide to Biblical Intrigue, or something along those lines.<br /><br />The book's dual parts come from the historical discussion on religion, combined with a fictional story about a riddle which needs to be figured out. [...]<br /><br />I have to imagine there will be a sharp polarization regarding opinions on this book based on religious affiliation, or lack thereof. This tired debate should not be how you approach this book. It is a work of fiction, first and foremost, and should be regarded as such. Despite the fact that Dan Brown states all the documents and rituals in the book are factual, a token investigation shows these claims are flimsy, at best. Throughout the book, Brown toys with fact and fiction so much that one isn't sure where the line is drawn between them. In the end, it's hard not to see Brown as self-important, since he is essentially dubbing his book as the Holy Grail, in a very tangible way. I'm not sure he intended that, at least not overtly. But that's what his claim ultimately is.<br /><br />As I said earlier, the religious history is intriguing. This is so true it's easy to find yourself fully engaged in the book, regardless of the pure fictional aspect of it. The \\"code\\" keeps you interested. Yet in the end, it lacks the literary punch to keep you hooked throughout, as the believability factor creeps towards absurdity as the pages dwindle. This is the core of the fictional piece of the book. As it winds down, we see the story fade into a weak, mediocre pulpit in which Brown uses to preach his message.<br /><br />The payoff to the novel is disappointing, since we don't get much of a crescendo to either story. The ending is a distasteful combination of the predicable and anti-climatic. You're left assuming Brown couldn't tie it together, and was forced to patch things up as best he could so the story could end. For many people, I believe the intrigue of the religious aspect is so strong it allows them to overlook the weak ending and poor fiction in the book. Personally, I find it very difficult to allow the weak ending to be overshadowed by the excellent opening, an opening which was left ultimately unrewarding.<br /><br />Despite all the criticisms, I think it's a good book that *some* people should read. As I see it, the potential problem lies in the thought that people will have problems differentiating fact and fiction, and the book will serve as another disinformation tool which is no better than the church which it, in part, attempts to expose. The story, characters, and dialog are enjoyable until they get inane, the layers of involvement degrade, and the conclusion derails. Still, I did enjoy my time reading it.<br /><br />In all, a good book for those who are easily able to differentiate between fact and fiction, who can assess the book on its own merits without allowing the loaded fictitious scenarios to sway them either way, and for those people (like me) who are likely uninformed about the subject matter it tries to uncover, namely the details of the Holy Grail and the religious history surrounding it.differentiating fact and fiction, and the book will serve as another disinformation tool which is no better than the church which it, in part, attempts to expose.

B000002U82|5.0|i just listened to Darkside of the Moon through the entire cd for the first time my freshman year of high school and i was literally speechless after i heard it. there were no words to describe how wonderful this cd is. the transistions, the vocals, the many different instruments, and everything else combined made me feel like i was on a roller coaster actually riding the music. it sounds silly but everytime i hear breathe/speak to me i feel like i'm going up and down on a ride at a theme park. nothing today can compare to this classic album! i 100% recommend this album to anyone, especially if your just getting into classic rock and discovering real music (not that classic rock is the ONLY real music). for your own sake, please enjoy!

B0002OERI0|5.0|I purchased this album when it was released, and it became my personal soundtrack at that time. These songs are tinged with melancholy, the exact of tone my life at that point, and as I went back and listened to this album over the weekend, I knew I had to post a review.  <br /> <br />  Politically, I am conservative. Yes, this album is bursting at the seams with discontent concerning American society, and it doesn't bother me. I don't think that Green Day was jumping on some musical bandwagon against George W. Bush, if this is their political opinion, then it's not my problem. I listen to raving liberals all the time, and everyone thinks a little bit differently, I enjoy hearing how everyone thinks for themselves, because it's better than indifference. <br /> <br />  The way everyone is ranting about Green Day selling out with this album is irritating, mostly because I have heard \\"Good Riddance\\" about 50 times more than I've heard any of the songs off \\"American Idiot\\" combined played on the radio.  <br /> <br />  The album iself amazed me when I heard it, as it was recorded it was intended to be listened to all the way through, so listen to it that way first. The first time I listened all the way through, I was taken through a vast range of emotions, and everything moves along so smoothly it all feels like it's one song. In a way it is, as it's told as a continuous story. My individual favorites changed the more I listened to the album, but right now I'd have to go with \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\", \\"Give Me Novacaine\\", \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" and \\"Whatsername\\". <br /> <br />  Listen to it and judge for yourself.
B00021R7CG|2.0|I saw a glimpse of this movie earlier on HBO and was interested enough to purchase the DVD.  Too bad I didn't watch the movie first when it was free!  James Earl Jone's acting abilities were wasted on this movie, and I won't comment on the others. <br />I'm glad that our armed forces are not as inept as portrayed <br />in this film.  Sorry I can't be more complimentary, but.....
B000003TAR|5.0|Rape Me begins with simple but catchy guitar. As it progresses you find its anything but. The title of the song is truly the meaning and is delivered with brutal honesty from Kurt Cobain's raw voice and moody lyrics. The repetitive drums stay throughout the song. Brought down with such force it is like a punch to the stomach, the blow being dominant.  <br />It is the words though, that convey the most power. Cobain had a dark history and his songs reflect that. He was \\"raped\\" of many things a normal childhood, certainty and a life he thought wasn't worth living.  All these things he carried into adulthood. Its him giving consent to go through it all again. Recognition with \\"Rape me my friend, Rape me again\\" He makes you feel hopeless and that you have nothing to acquire. How he had no control over how he felt or his depression.  <br />Towards the end of the song the singing turns into screaming which shows the emotion of his hurt. An angry plea to just go ahead do what you did to me over and over again. The song is dark and haunting as a piece of someone's life is played out.  The guitar gets to be almost impossible to hear with Cobain's screaming. It remains long in your head after its stopped playing. <br />The composition of the song is so pure and untouched. Which gives it an acoustic feeling. It has no special effects or extras. Its simple and organic which is refreshing to the ear. It's funny how the name of the band was Nirvana because it was something Kurt Cobain never found. From an unstable childhood to his suicide maybe it was hope for him to one day find it.   <br />  <br />
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I am Icelandic. Yet I didn't used to like Sigur Rs back in the late nineties when I still lived in Iceland. I guess I was too used to \\"normal\\" music. Sigur Rs just didn't resonate with me for some reason. But gradually people of all ages in Iceland started to be captivated by their music (I accredit that to Icelandic radio stations actually playing their music, unlike in America). So my girlfriend and I bought their CDs here in the US and we gave them a try. It took a long time, but within the last year or two I realized that Sigur Rs in fact transcends music. Their sounds are devine, God-inspired, reflecting purity, and everything that Iceland is. No other music has ever succeeded in making me cry. With Sigur Rs it happens almost every time.     Those fellow countrymen of mine have truly created something exceptional. One cannot categorize it. As many have said, \\"Takk...\\" is certainly the most accessible of their albums yet, but it's still not commercial, it's still Sigur Rs. For beginners, it's the album to go for, gtis byrjun and ( ) should follow, in that order. Listening to Sigur Rs takes patience, but the harvest is ever so sweet and gratifying. One will not be disappointed but instead grateful to the muses for inspiring those four Icelanders. Their music, as exemplified by \\"Takk...\\" is at the same time vast, epic, romantic, sad, happy, beautiful, mindblowing, transcendant, yet strangely it cannot be described in words. Your lives will be forever changed.
B00000IPAX|1.0|Even listening to the very beginning of Adam's song is enough to make you cringe and want to turn it off. Its about a sixteen year old who's \\"to depressed to go on\\" just by that one line you know the song is truly emo. What makes it so pathetic is that its coming from three men who are all over thirty, are married and have kids. I find this ridiculous and think that how life was so hard as kid should be left to those who are for a fact kids not grown men.  <br /> The song is whiny and begs for sympathy. The guitar is annoying and drums boring with dull beats. The lyrics barely make sense and it seems as if they used random words to make sure it all rhymes. For example \\"I traced the cord back to the wall,No wonder it was never plugged in at all.\\" A big reason of why song is so terrible is because of these stupid lyrics. Its distasteful and has no real meaning. Which makes me wonder how anyone can relate to them at all?  <br /> Another reason it is so awful is because of the lead singers voice, Tom Delonge. Its flat and shows no emotion. This is understandable, after all how much can be expected from a thirty year old man on the emotions of an angry teenager. I would think not much. Even so he's not really even singing the words its more like he's talking. It is clear he has no range and sings in almost one pitch.  <br /> The entire band is a sad excuse to make music and money by directing it towards teenagers because all that happens to them is heartbreak, depression and loss. It makes bands like Blink-182 think its easy to write about those things and make a wealthy profit. It never occurs to them how oddly out of place they are and or their heartless singing about a world they don't belong in. I rejoice in that fact that no more horrendous music can be made from them for the band has broken up.  <br />  <br />

B0007TKNIS|5.0|Five stars for one of the best movies I've seen this year.  Beautifully orchestrated, acted and performed, this movie version does the theatrical masterpiece proud.<br /><br />Gerard Butler is so handsome and yet so intense in his portrayal of the tormented Phantom that if I were Christine (the excellent Emmy Rossum), that Raoul guy (vocally gifted Patrick Wilson) would have had to drag me out of that underground boudoir with wild horses and a bulldozer.<br /><br />Wilson seemed like a teenager in love compared to the agonized yearning of the Phantom, and in a different musical he would have been hopping around a gazebo in the rain singing \\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\".<br /><br />Minnie Driver does a fine comedy turn as Prima Donna Carlotta, and although she doesn't actually sing in the movie, she does a credit worthy number during the credits.  Miranda Richardson is perfectly cast as Madame Giry, longtime keeper of the Phantom's secret.  Rossum is also a casting coup, and the doe-eyed Jennifer Beal look-a-like fully captures the essence of Christine, the Phantom perpetual flava-of-the-month.<br /><br />The movie had me spellbound from Act one, Scene one until the closing credits, and I highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 12, 2005
0783226063|5.0|Dune (directed by David Lynch) is one of the most immersive and visionary sci-fi movies ever.  This film creates 4 different worlds in incredible visual detail.  The story line, acting, and directing are all superb.  This movie reminds me of \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" in that it is not perfect.  It has flaws, such as the big worm battle-scene is too long.  And they edited too much out of the movie in order to shorten it, and therefore it's hard to follow if you haven't read the book.  I would knock off a 1/2 star if I could.  But the high points of this movie are so excellent, like Dracula, that overall it's an great movie.  See it, buy it, and if necessary either read the book or have a friend there who knows the story when you watch it.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|the album is amazing, showcasing reggae/dub/hip hop/rock elements with the grace of jah.  with quests like nas, bounty killers, ek a mouse & his brothers like stephen, julian & ziggy.  if you are looking for an entire album of songs that are like jamrock well sorry but their not here, welcome to jamrock is a sly & robbie edit who are legendary dub kings of jamaica & also have an album that come out late last year that also features dubreggae with hip hop elements produced by legendary producer bass player bill laswell.  so if you dont like sean paul at all this may be an album to stay away from but if your love for bob marley is that strong you may over sea that like the song move! which is a semi remix of exodus using the back ground beat & dubin over it, absolutelly fantastic. this is miles better and more of a full album than halfway tree though adding more flare to the typical reggae style. but if you really liked it was written & still searchin you will be in heaven with this 1.  i would also recomend this to anyone who wants to get into the reggae world outside bob but is too afraid because they are unfamilar to real jamaican reggae.  i want to thank you all out their for embrasing this like it should be because we here in america have not appriciated the absolutelly power & spirit of reggae music from jamaica & only see bob marley as the 1 & only. if his kids have to do it well then so be it, what ever it takes to push this into the 4 fronts of main stream society. in 2001 halfway tree won reggae album of the year & even though that is great it is still not saying much for it in general, this year we need this album to win album of the year & start a new revolution in world music. keep on jamrockin
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul McCartney's new album is another stellar and critically praised effort -- he's been on a roll with critics of late and his momentum doesn't stop here.  This album is eclectic and interesting and has a dose of everything: Fine Line which is vintage McCartney pop, Promise to your Girl which is quirky and upbeat, Beatle sounding stuff such as Jenny Wren, dark songs such as Riding to Vanity Fair and At The Mercy, big ballads like Anyway.  This is a grower and I feel compelled to go back to it for repeated listening.  Vintage McCartney..great album!

B00000DCH9|5.0|Billy Joel \\"piano man,\\" is one that has a simple, beautiful, and powerful flow rythem and sound of a combing harmonica, piano and soft voice of Billy Joel himself, that just seems to raise your spirit and strengthen your heart. It's the tale of just another night in a bar, with just your normal people inside. The song goes one by one through all of the people telling a bit of their story and their reaction with the hero of this song, the piano man, who is simply doing his job of keeping everyone entertained, which is the testament to his skills as a piano man. With clever lryecs such as \\" and the waitress is practicing politics, and the business man slowly gets stoned, yes their sharing a drink they called loneliness but its better then drinking alone.\\"  To get the point across, you just cant help but think my g-d this is perfection. The lryecs which hit the spot for just about everyone are merely the skin of this body, while the piano itself is the backbone. It's a extravagant  symphony along a peaceful river that comes to mind when you hear this piano. Simple going, easy with the flow, and yet its among the most powerful and moving sounds that one can engage in, enjoying with full pleasure. It is neither melancholia or optimistic with joy. Just itself, like the wind blowing from all around you. Not sad or happy, just itself like life itself. With the lryecs being the skin, and the piano being the backbone, the harmonia introduced to us form the start of this song is the legs and arms. It's the kicker that gets you moving to stand up and away form this boring materialistic life which we have all been subjected to, close you eyes, sing along and encounter this song in its own beauty within your mind. The harmonica is that of something that can bring us back to the Bob Dylan days. All in its own a new language should be created just to express the emotions and feelings of these sounds which out due any word of any language I know of.  The last element to this human being is the Billy Joel voice itself which is the heart. Never off key, always making you feel loved and caressed all over, and never telling a lie is what this voice does. Billy Joel is doing just a little bit more then talking and a little bit less then screaming, it's the perfect mix to be consumed  by all. With all these combined you can witness what the Greeks where talking about when they said the perfect specimen. For that is what it is, strong and humble, balanced, flowing, witty charming and never fails to please the crowd.

0786890754|4.0|Many reviewers said that Holly's grief in this book was too drawn out, and that it was unrealistic.  Listen: everyone grieves differently, for different amounts of time, with different perceptions of reality, with different ways of understanding and coming to terms with the death of their loved one.  I can't imagine losing my husband and attempting to pick up the pieces he left behind.  However, I can say with certainty, there was absolutely nothing wrong with Cecelia Ahern's interpretation of grief.   <br /> <br />Yes, Holly cried more than any other character I have ever read.  Yes, she was was a character that I wanted to sympathisize with, but annoyed me at times because she refused to help herself.  Yes, her friends should have pushed for grief counseling instead of taking her to the pub.  Still, from beginning to end, Holly became a friend and when I turned the final page, all I wanted was for her to find happiness again.   <br /> <br />Read the book.  Hug a loved one.  Call an old friend.  Appreciate life -- this one will help you do it.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|After reading the book Wicked; The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, I saw this cd in my local library. It is phenomenal. Knowing the story as I do, it seems to be a little changed from the book, but that is no matter. The music is incredible, both Kristen Chenoweth and Idina Menzel have gorgeous voices, and the orchestration simply must be heard to be believed. This is now on my list of favorite musicals of all time, along with Phantom of the Opera, The King and I, and The Music Man, to put it in a little perspective. Must have for any music lover, especially if you love musicals.

B0006FFRW0|5.0|In 1994 Trent Reznor released \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" the highly anticipated follow-up to Nine Inch Nail's debut \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" (1989). The album shot to the top of the charts and has sold over four million copies to date. Along with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" (1991) and Green Day's \\"Dookie,\\" (1994) \\"The Downward Spiral\\" is a landmark album that serves as the soundtrack to the generation X of the 90s, and of the cynicism of the times.<br /><br />\\"The Downward Spiral\\"-never was an album so aptly named.  \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" as its title suggests, tries to convey to the listener what happens when everything goes wrong. The modern day industrial opera showcases one mans torment and decent into a hell-on-earth.<br /><br />The themes of \\"The Downward Spiral\\"-anger, fear, regret, nihilism-were also the prevalent themes of its predecessor \\"Pretty Hate Machine.\\"  But compared to \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" \\"The Downward Spiral\\" is a far more intense and ultimately aggressive album. Although \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" is a classic, no doubt, and a fan favorite, \\"The Downward Spiral\\" has far more to offer. It takes \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" to the next level in terms of musical arraignments, songwriting, and overall intensity. So while the novice should start off with \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" \\"The Downward Spiral\\" has more of an edge and is the better of the two.<br /><br />Generally speaking, it has been my experience that most albums are either one of two things-catchy and assessable (Aerosmith, Beatles, KISS) or abstract and arty and need repeated listens to fully appreciate (The Velvet Underground, Sonic Youth, Pink Floyd). \\"The Downward Spiral\\" is a unique album in that the first half fits the \\"assessable\\" category and the second half fits the \\"abstract\\" category. It is no surprise then that most of the albums singles are from the first half.<br /><br />The journey begins with \\"Mr. Self-Destruct\\" and at once the listener is thrust into a bleak musical landscape that is relentless in its pessimism and gives the listener little respite. Over pounding beats, Reznor addresses the listener directly, telling him/her of their pent up lust and rage. Although the song slows down and calms, angry whispers seem only to heighten the songs intensity, before the listener is thrust back into the hammering beats.<br /><br />\\"Piggy\\" reads like a submission, a capitulation to defeat. It's an admission that all hope is lost. At this point, early on in the journey, you know that there is no hope of redemption. At the same time, however, since all is lost, nothing matters, so there is a sort-of fatalistic release from suffering. As the song winds down, tension grows and grows. The song climaxes with manic, bohemian-like drumming towards the end, which signifies chaos, giving the song the perfect effect.<br /><br />If resignation is the theme of \\"Piggy,\\" pure unadulterated rage is the theme of \\"Hearsay.\\" \\"God is dead, and no one cares, if there is a hell, I'll you there!\\" Reznor declares. Although possibly Reznor's darkest song, it is also one of his catchiest. The crushing industrial beats pound as the riff takes hold.<br /><br />The stage is now set for \\"March of the Pigs,\\" an ode to a heard mentality. The industrial tinged metal riff grabs hold of the listener, refusing to let go-until synthesizers pulsate the listeners every nerve. This was one of the albums major hits and also one of the album's most infectious songs.<br /><br />\\"Closer,\\" the album's huge hit and highlight, is one of the 90s catchiest singles. The theme of this mid-tempo, semi-club song seems to be not just about lust, but of longing. Although unfulfilled carnal lust is a major premise, it's equally a song of wanting to be fulfilled. It's a plea of wanting to connect with someone-to help alleviate the loneliness, to be fulfilled, to \\"be closer to God.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ruiner,\\" as the title would suggest, tells the story of someone who is a parasite, a deceitful leach who ruins lives. The lyrics are rather abstract, so the listener can take away from it whatever he or she sees. Although not the catchiest song on the album, it keeps the momentum going.<br /><br /> For the most part, the lyrics of the frantic \\"The Becoming,\\" are also abstract. I take the theme of the song to be a desire to end all cognition-as it is just \\"noise\\" that is making the protagonist hysterical. This downbeat song gets better with repeated plays.<br /><br />Although \\"I Do Not Want This\\" is not one of the albums best known songs, it is a personal favorite of mine. It starts out slow, yet forceful, and builds up momentum as it slugs along. I take it to be about (1) feeling frustrated with everything and being despondent and (2) rejecting how others perceive you and (3) longing for a deeper meaning and fulfillment.<br /><br />The short but catchy frantic \\"Big Man with a Gun,\\" serves as a catharsis of all pent-up sexual frustration. As the song progresses, it gets more and more intense, which is in total contrast to the following instrumental track \\"A Warm Place.\\"<br /><br />At last, with \\"A Warm Place,\\" the listener gets a temporary reprieve. This morose beautiful piece commutates what its title states-a sense of feeling safe in a world and in a mind gone mad.<br /><br />But alas, the reprieve is short lived. \\"Eraser\\" tells of how one person can hurt and use another. It's a fuming song that just gets angrier and more intense as it progresses.<br /><br />The infectious \\"Reptile\\" commutates musically just that-long, scaly and slithering. Again, like much of the second half of the album, its meaning can be interpreted in different ways. The lyric \\"she spread herself wide-open to let the insects in,\\" leads me to believe that the song is about someone lonely and desperate, who longs for love and affection and allows herself to be used by \\"insects\\". It's a song about someone \\"impure\\" yet \\"beautiful.\\"<br /><br />The album's title track tells of the suicide of a lifelong, self-loathing person, who ends it all in one-tiny-flash. Although not really a song, this track puts the whole album in perspective.<br /><br />The album's second highlight \\"Hurt\\" is undeniably one of the best songs from the 1990s. It's very straight-forward and simple, yet powerful. If all that proceeded this song  was rage and anger, \\"Hurt\\" is a total and complete descent into sadness-of realizing that everyone close to you is going to leave you, one way or another, sooner or later and that we all die alone. It's a little ironic that such an intense album would end on a whimper rather than a bang. But that just adds to the power of the song and is the perfect way to close the album.<br /><br />\\"The Downward Spiral\\" is not the easiest album to listen to. The anger and intensity of this album might initially turn-off some listeners. But along with anger, this album also shows beauty, depth, and empathy of human suffering.<br /><br />If you are collecting the best works of the 1990s or the best-albums of all-time, \\"The Downward Spiral\\" is an essential album to add to any collection.from it whatever he or she sees.

So while the novice should start off with \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" \\"The Downward Spiral\\" has more of an edge and is the better of the two.<br /><br />Generally speaking, it has been my experience that most albums are either one of two things-catchy and assessable (Aerosmith, Beatles, KISS) or abstract and arty and need repeated listens to fully appreciate (The Velvet Underground, Sonic Youth, Pink Floyd). \\"The Downward Spiral\\" is a unique album in that the first half fits the \\"assessable\\" category and the second half fits the \\"abstract\\" category. It is no surprise then that most of the albums singles are from the first half.<br /><br />The journey begins with \\"Mr. Self-Destruct\\" and at once the listener is thrust into a bleak musical landscape that is relentless in its pessimism and gives the listener little respite. Over pounding beats, Reznor addresses the listener directly, telling him/her of their pent up lust and rage. Although the song slows down and calms, angry whispers seem only to heighten the songs intensity, before the listener is thrust back into the hammering beats.<br /><br />\\"Piggy\\" reads like a submission, a capitulation to defeat. It's an admission that all hope is lost. At this point, early on in the journey, you know that there is no hope of redemption. At the same time, however, since all is lost, nothing matters, so there is a sort-of fatalistic release from suffering. As the song winds down, tension grows and grows. The song climaxes with manic, bohemian-like drumming towards the end, which signifies chaos, giving the song the perfect effect.<br /><br />If resignation is the theme of \\"Piggy,\\" pure unadulterated rage is the theme of \\"Hearsay.\\" \\"God is dead, and no one cares, if there is a hell, I'll you there!\\" Reznor declares. Although possibly Reznor's darkest song, it is also one of his catchiest. The crushing industrial beats pound as the riff takes hold.<br /><br />The stage is now set for \\"March of the Pigs,\\" an ode to a heard mentality. The industrial tinged metal riff grabs hold of the listener, refusing to let go-until synthesizers pulsate the listeners every nerve. This was one of the albums major hits and also one of the album's most infectious songs.<br /><br />\\"Closer,\\" the album's huge hit and highlight, is one of the 90s catchiest singles. The theme of this mid-tempo, semi-club song seems to be not just about lust, but of longing. Although unfulfilled carnal lust is a major premise, it's equally a song of wanting to be fulfilled. It's a plea of wanting to connect with someone-to help alleviate the loneliness, to be fulfilled, to \\"be closer to God.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ruiner,\\" as the title would suggest, tells the story of someone who is a parasite, a deceitful leach who ruins lives. The lyrics are rather abstract, so the listener can take away from it whatever he or she sees. Although not the catchiest song on the album, it keeps the momentum going.<br /><br /> For the most part, the lyrics of the frantic \\"The Becoming,\\" are also abstract. I take the theme of the song to be a desire to end all cognition-as it is just \\"noise\\" that is making the protagonist hysterical. This downbeat song gets better with repeated plays.<br /><br />Although \\"I Do Not Want This\\" is not one of the albums best known songs, it is a personal favorite of mine. It starts out slow, yet forceful, and builds up momentum as it slugs along. I take it to be about (1) feeling frustrated with everything and being despondent and (2) rejecting how others perceive you and (3) longing for a deeper meaning and fulfillment.<br /><br />The short but catchy frantic \\"Big Man with a Gun,\\" serves as a catharsis of all pent-up sexual frustration. As the song progresses, it gets more and more intense, which is in total contrast to the following instrumental track \\"A Warm Place.\\"<br /><br />At last, with \\"A Warm Place,\\" the listener gets a temporary reprieve. This morose beautiful piece commutates what its title states-a sense of feeling safe in a world and in a mind gone mad.<br /><br />But alas, the reprieve is short lived. \\"Eraser\\" tells of how one person can hurt and use another. It's a fuming song that just gets angrier and more intense as it progresses.<br /><br />The infectious \\"Reptile\\" commutates musically just that-long, scaly and slithering. Again, like much of the second half of the album, its meaning can be interpreted in different ways. The lyric \\"she spread herself wide-open to let the insects in,\\" leads me to believe that the song is about someone lonely and desperate, who longs for love and affection and allows herself to be used by \\"insects\\". It's a song about someone \\"impure\\" yet \\"beautiful.\\"<br /><br />The album's title track tells of the suicide of a lifelong, self-loathing person, who ends it all in one-tiny-flash. Although not really a song, this track puts the whole album in perspective.<br /><br />The album's second highlight \\"Hurt\\" is undeniably one of the best songs from the 1990s. It's very straight-forward and simple, yet powerful. If all that proceeded this song  was rage and anger, \\"Hurt\\" is a total and complete descent into sadness-of realizing that everyone close to you is going to leave you, one way or another, sooner or later and that we all die alone. It's a little ironic that such an intense album would end on a whimper rather than a bang. But that just adds to the power of the song and is the perfect way to close the album.<br /><br />\\"The Downward Spiral\\" is not the easiest album to listen to. The anger and intensity of this album might initially turn-off some listeners. But along with anger, this album also shows beauty, depth, and empathy of human suffering.<br /><br />If you are collecting the best works of the 1990s or the best-albums of all-time, \\"The Downward Spiral\\" is an essential album to add to any collection.<br /><br />The second bonus disc is a cool collection of songs/remixes from that era and should please NIN fans. \\"Burn\\" from \\"Natural Born Killers,\\" and \\"Dead Souls,\\" (a Joy Division cover) are especially cool.from it whatever he or she sees.

0064407667|5.0|In the fun-filled first novel of the series the Baudelarie children (Violet, 14, an inventor, Klaus, 12, an inquisitive reader and scholar, and Sunny, a spunky biting infant ), are orphaned by a \\"mysterious fire\\" only to be taken in by the disastrous Count Olaf who is more interested in the Baudelaire fortune than the children.  Olaf unleashes a terrible plan to marry Violet the oldest of three children by using his acting troupe and by presenting a play.  Olaf of course plans to inherit the fortune and the three children must use their wits and skills to stop him.  Will Olaf's plan be exposed before it is too late?<br /><br />As a reader I am anxious to read the other books in the series as usual with this style of exceptional literature present situations are not always as they appear to be.
B000001ESF|5.0|Korn and Pissporr Diddy better than Rush? You silly, stupid homo!<br /><br />As for this album, I love this album. The title track ALONE is worth the price. Also, the other songs are great as well. Neil Peart makes most drummers look like they're throwing their drums on walls. Oh yeah, everything about this band is great too.<br /><br />I hope a blizzard strikes St. Paul, MN and takes HT Bobby as a victim.
B000002GJH|2.0|very little to recommend here, especially when compared to the last 2 soundgarden discs or pearl jam material.  the production on it is very poor, sounding like it was processed thru a coffee can.  i listened to it once.  probably won't listen again.  and believe me...i'm a huge cornell fan.  buy audioslave instead for more mature & polished material.
B000063DIH|4.0|I love Iron Maiden. I feel that they're one of (if not THE) best 80's metal bands (I don't mean glam s*** like Poison, Bon Jovi, etc.). Entering the 90's, they went on a downward spiral. This is better than \\"NPFTD\\", but still below average for Maiden. Let's go through the songs.<br /><br />1. Be Quick or Be Dead - Good starter. 5/5<br /><br />2. From Here to Eternity - 3/5<br /><br />3. Afraid to Shoot Strangers - 4/5<br /><br />4. Fear Is the Key 1/5 WHAT THE F**K?<br /><br />5. Childhood's End 3/5<br /><br />6. Wasting Love 3/5<br /><br />7. Fugitive 4/5<br /><br />8. Chains of Misery 3/5<br /><br />9. Apparition 2/5 See #4<br /><br />10. Judas Be My Guide 3/5<br /><br />11. Weekend Warrior 3/5<br /><br />12. Fear of the Dark 6/5 The best song on the album, BAR NONE! The haunting keyboards sent a chill down my spine when I listen to this.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />FOTD is the best 90's Maiden album. The title track, Be Quick or Be Dead, and Afraid To Shoot Strangers are the best songs. Overall, I'd buy it for the three mentioned tracks. If you think this sucks, you're in worse luck, TXF and VXI suck even more...
B00005JNTX|4.0|This movie was full of action with all the action and violence mixed into one good movie was awsome because almost every sceen was filled with a lot of action.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Tim Burton directed this film in 89 and it has well surpassed the test of time. Ignoring the frankly silly elements of the series and the over-repeatidivness of the comics, Burton brought a more adult dark style to a movie that could have so easily been a typical comic book superhero outing. Casting Michael Keaton as Batman was quite a unique choice. He completley apppears as two different people, Bruce Wayne and Batman, inducing Bruce with a brooding, complexity, and Batman with a confident,dark and almost nasty personality. Jack Nicholson IS the Joker, the role is by far the actors individual best and one of the best villans to EVER grace the silver screen and Kim Bassinger is lovlely as photo journalist Vicki Vale. To say this is very Dark would be an understatement, Batman Bleeds, faces are brutally disfigured and the entire plot stands as The Joker trying to become a \\"Homicidal artist\\" Rather than in the comic style of villans where every villan is just..well..a petty thief, Burton gave each villan their own back story and development and ultimatley, some of the best death scene scenarios of all time..leaving no room for the cheap,\\"I'll Get you next time Batman\\" cliches. Heroes bleed, love does not conquer all, and villans Die. This is the world Tim Burton created for Batman..and 17 years later it's yet to be outclassed.
B000AARKOO|4.0|First off I want to say that the cinematography was probably this movie's greatest strongpoint.  The world in which this movie played out seemed to be the main character in the film, which was probably partly the intent as the story revolves around Jerusalem.  I will part with some people's opinion regarding Orlando Bloom.  I think Orlando did an excellent job.  I think he's an excellent actor.  His fault was not in his performance...it was in a script that left him with no real climax in his character.  Yes, he had some great moments, but when the story ends...it ends.  And it ends leaving the audience saying \\"WHA?  Are we done here?\\" <br /> <br />At least that's what I was saying.  I'm not a fan of having to think to hard at the end of the moving...WONDERING what happened to the character after the curtain has been pulled and lights turn on in the theater.  Those just make me frustrated.  I want a story.  Beginning to end.  Make me feel complete!  In any case, to end this ramble this was the movies greatest shortcoming.  No real conclusion. <br /> <br />The story is mostly interesting, though one can't help but ask why it couldn't have taken some different directions.  If one is going to take so much liberty on history at least give us some more fantasy to fill in all the gaps.  And yes Ridley.  Not all Christians were evil and not all Muslims were peace lovers.  Too typecasted.  And the wrong ones.  This unfortunately took away some of the believability in the film. <br /> <br />To clarify, since my comments could seem contradictory regarding believability and fantasy.  The only real downfall of this film is that it tries to parallel events that actually happened, while changing half of the facts.  I'd rather he just make up some fantasy story and only have die hard historians be able to figure out the history its based off of.  That way no one is offended, because its not a twisted story of half truths. <br /> <br />Despite these negatives I found myself interested in this film.  If only for three stong points.  It had good actors.  It had GREAT music.  And the cinematography was excellent.  I will be buying this movie, even if just to have as a reference disk in my home theater.  Its coming in DTS.  And that's good news indeed.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This product was bought used, it was shipped immediately, and the seller said it was in good condition, it was like new.  I am very pleased with this seller, and would definately buy from him again.

B000069AUI|4.0|As a newer fan of Coldplay after a work colleague got me interested in this very talented Brittish pop-rock band - I first listened to their first album 'Parachutes' and enjoyed the vibrant and colourful 'touches' in the songs and sound. 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head' is their second album first released in 2002. This includes the now well known and hit songs for Coldplay in 'Clocks' and 'The Scientist' that is by far the best songs on this album if not two of the best songs from Coldplay to date. The lead singer has a haunting sounding voice that will take him to many heights in fame and success. Another nice song is 'God Put A Smile Upon Your Face' that has a nice video clip to it.<br /><br />This album is for any fan of Coldplay and the fan won't be dissapointed by this mellow array of heart pulling songs. A must for any music library.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This is truly an amazing film. Before I watched it I was a Christian, but not really a true one. Seeing what Jesus went through for me and everyone else in the world really moved me, and it brought me closer to God. I believe everyone should see this movie. It is really, really great, and you will not be disappointed.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Voices of angels, the kind that actually raises the hairs on the back of the neck, especially when Chloe's rendition of \\"Danny Boy,\\" is sung without benefit of music...you have to really listen to realize that there is no music; that its her clear, beautiful voice you are hearing.   <br /> <br />Altogether a great \\"variety\\" show, as well. How wonderful to see some \\"class\\" back in the theater with the lovely gowns, the formal orchestra, etc. <br /> <br />Mostly, however, just a joy to watch and/or listen to, especially for those of us with Celtic roots.
0440416027|4.0|David Almond is an incredible author of children's/young adult fiction, and this book, along with Kit's Wilderness, is the proof.  The book reads like a poem, with very short chapters and not too much detail, challenging the imagination to provide an exact description of Skellig.  The imagery is beautiful, almost dreamlike.  There is a part where Micheal, his freind, and Skellig fly around in circles that in the hands of a less skilled writer would be corny but is breathtaking to read.  I would recommend this unforgettable novel to readers of about 10 upwards, and hope that adults won't ignore it either.  It is truly unforgettable.
B0009QZ456|5.0|\\"Crush\\" by Gavin DeGraw is an amazing song; the lyrics, the vocals, the instrumentals are all heavenly. The intro is a gorgeous display of piano performed by Gavin DeGraw, which creates the image of a peaceful, rushing waterfall. I know that that sounds like an oxymoron, but if you listen to the song, you will understand. The song combines this piano with guitar and drums in perfect harmony. The song tells a story of romance and love without the cheesy, cliched phrases that are so overdone. And the music doesn't maintain a boring tone; the tempo, melody, and sound in general all vary throughout the song. It's so great because it's appropriate for any situation. If you're depressed or upset, it will lighten your mood and lift your spirits. If your happy, it will make you want to sing out loud. It's truly a terrific song and I strongly recommend buying the album.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|That's what this album is all about: it's complex and literate, but it's simultaneously raw and bluesy, with the instruments sounding almost out of time with each other, and Bob's unorthodox guitar work holding it all together. He tries out several different types of music, such as slow blues (\\"It Takes a Lot To Laugh...\\"), gospel(\\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\"), pop (\\"Like a Rolling Stone\\"), rock n' roll (the title track), and turns in one of his better folk songs with \\"Desolation Row.\\" As for the lyrics, your guess as is good as mine. For example, \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" is either about the beginning of the hippie movement or gay sex. But I only suggest this to people who listen to something other than what's on TRL. Being conversant with the styles I mentioned would help, but this is definitely an excellent album.
B000AL730O|5.0|This new album is amazing, brilliant and very solid. It's a master class about the songwriting and the playing.<br /><br />Congratulations Sir Paul.
B0008GNJZY|4.0|A solid feel-good sports movie that gets you interested in the characters. What more can you ask for? Good actors, trying hard. Worth an evening.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is as close to perfect of an album I have ever heard.  It just may be my favorite album of all time and I'm not into most metal.  It ranks right up with some of my other favorites, which include Tool, The Smiths, Pavement, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Primus and Janes Addiction.    <br /> <br />Every song is amazing.  How anyone can compare Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\" to \\"Master of Puppets\\" is beyond me.  Although RIB is powerful, it sounds like they just slopped it together compared to \\"Master of Puppets\\".  You can really tell Metallica took their time to create \\"Master of Puppets\\".  Each second of each song seems purposeful, not just a bunch of cool riffs thrown to yelling although \\"Reign In Blood\\" is as good as that gets.  I'd take Neurosis over Slayer though.  <br /> <br />The trilogy of Metallica classics \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"And Justice for All\\", and \\"Ride the Lightening\\" are simply some of the best music ever written.  They all have such depth, imagery, intelligence and musicianship most metal bands (other than Tool, Neurosis, Iron Maiden and a few others) can never achieve. <br /> <br />If they only continued making music like this but at least they did create 3 classics (4 if you include \\"Kill 'Em All\\").  That's more than most bands can say.
032109333X|5.0|This was the text for my college Shakespeare classes over 20 years ago (different edition of course) I still have it and still use it. A wonderful book for students and those who want not only the complete works but some well written and authoritative information about Shakespeare and the world in which he lived and wrote.<br /><br />The texts of the plays are well foot-noted and the type is easy on the eyes. Well worth the investment.
0689859368|5.0|For some reason I've started to enjoy children's literature more than I ever did as a kid.  I found the Spiderwick Chronicles recently and decided to try the first in the series.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Field Guide.  The concept of hidden things and hidden places has always fascinated me, and the book offers plenty of those.  Having visited in childhood the rickety and spooky old Victorian mansion in which my Great Aunt Blanche resided, I can relate to the children's experience completely.  Everyone should have a Great Aunt Blanche in their life.<br /><br />One of the things I like most is that the children are children as they really are, rather than children as we'd like them to be.  Their squabbles, juvenile diplomacy, and united front against the common \\"enemy\\" are very realistic; it's delightful.  I suspect that this aspect of the book will appeal to most young readers, since they can usually smell a \\"lecture\\" however appealingly presented a mile away.<br /><br />The books are nicely bound and would make a lovely addition to a child's own collection.  The vocabulary of the book is very accessible to most children at third grade or above.  Smaller children will probably enjoy it as a read-to-me book.  It might be nice for an older child who already reads to share with a younger one who can't yet or is still a beginner.  I could see it as a nice series for a childrens' reading room in a public library with a volunteer reader.
0805027009|5.0|I read this book quite a few years ago, but up until that time I looked at George Armstrong Custer as an American hero. After reading this book I realized what he really was...a mass murderer! <br />This book will break your heart, and possibly bring you to tears, but it is a great read. It tells the history we were all taught in school from the other side, the side no one wanted us to know as children. Read this book and you'll agree with me. True american history, with no punches pulled.
B00004W221|5.0|This film teaches the lesson that doors only open for you when you push, and it teaches that lesson more effectively than perhaps any motivational film ever made. <br /> <br />Dan Ruettiger pushes through years of daunting physical, social and emotional obstacles to achieve two minutes of actual playing time for the University of Notre Dame.  Was it worth it?  Who are we to question another person's dream?  All that matters, is that it was worth it to him. <br /> <br />Contrary to the opinion of another reviewer, I believe that that game time was bestowed not out of pity, but as a fitting tribute to the constantly inspiring dedication shown by a young man who, by all rights, had no business wearing that gold helmet. <br /> <br />He gave HIMSELF the right to wear it by doing everything possible to put himself within touching distance of something that should have been impossible, and by doing so, he (through this film) creates a grand and powerful analogy of nothing less than the American Dream. <br /> <br />How much of your life is up to you?  You won't know until you push up against what look like limits and obstacles, until you reach for what looks to be out of reach, and find out if your push is hard enough and your arm is long enough.  To do this, you will have to overcome your own fear, the doubt of your friends and family, and the reluctance of all the people who just want to shut their doors in your face; and even then you may fail.  But no one ever made anything of themselves by scoffing at dedication and heart. <br /> <br />As Wayne Gretsky once said, \\"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\\"  This wonderful film is about being willing to take the shots again and again and again, to risk everything for something you want more than anything else.  Certainly there are more noble, more admirable dreams than to play football for a particular university; but if you think this film is just about a kid who wants to play football, you obviously have a pretty bigblind spot.
0440234743|5.0|This isn't your typical legal thriller.  A billionaire commits suicide in dramatic fashion, and leaves his fortune to a surprise heir, who is serving as a missionary in the jungles of South America.  Our hero is a lawyer on the mend from substance abuse, who is seeking redemption and trying to turn his life around into something more meaningful.  The adventure of hunting down the heir turns more into a spiritual journey frought with dangers.  This book reads quickly and didn't disappoint me one bit in the way it turned out.  Enjoy.
B000001ZCU|5.0|It's difficult to adequately describe the massive impact Soft Cell has had on me ever since I first heard this album on cassette all those years ago.<br /><br />They just blew me away!  Like most people, I got the album because of \\"Tainted Love\\" and then I found out 1) they didn't write it and 2) it was one of the weakest tracks on the album!<br /><br />Every track was totally unique and totally unlike anything that I'd heard before.  And then the \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" or the \\"Day in the Life\\" moment of the album, \\"Say Hello and Wave Goodbye\\" comes on and almost brings a tear to my eye; what a great way to end an album.<br /><br />Now, this disc comes with extra tracks which sometimes makes an album sound worse and less cohesive but here the opposite is true.  Especially if you consider that fact that the single \\"Torch\\" is here; another one of my favourite Soft Cell tunes.<br /><br />This album is by far their best and the sound quality of the recording is also quite good.  What they could do is to have the same tracks remastered and housed in a cardboard mini-lp replica sleeve and my life would be complete!<br /><br />One of my all-time favourite albums by a mile!

B0006L0LOS|3.0|This time we have a slightly different Catwoman than comic book readers are familiar with.  This time, Catwoman is merely the current incarnation of a long-running historical character that goes bach through the ages.  Patience (Catwoman) gets her start when she dies.  Mystic cats resurrect her and give her her new abilities.  Patience/Catwoman then has to balance between her two personalities as she tries to find her life's path. <br /> <br />This is a very feminine movie.  Our hero represents a female warrior archetype.  She must face and foil the world of men (the police and authority).  Her foe is the maker of beauty cream.  But the new beauty cream could be dangerous to all women who would use it.  All in all most of the characters and imagery are feminine in nature.  This should appeal to female audiences while the skimpy costume should keep the testosterone wielders interested as well. <br /> <br />The disk comes with an interesting documentary about the many faces of Catwoman with interviews with the various women who have taken on the role as well as others involved in the television/film versions.  All in all a pretty good disk.
B000005RT8|3.0|In this 1980 release, Paul had electronic devices in his hands and decided to play with them.  <br />It resulted on this album, one his most experimental. McCartney shows his clowny side altering his voice in Temporary Secretary ( the lyrics say that he doesn't need a true romancer, asks to Mr. Marks for a robot,according to the sounds throughout the track) and in On the way ( his voice tone always makes me laugh when he says \\"1, 2 and a 1234\\" in the very beggining).  <br />It was first Paul's work without the name of Wings. The band had Denny Laine(Wings fellow),Jimmy McCullogh's (Jimmy was a former Wings member) brother on guitars and Denny Seiwell playing drums. There are these guitarists, but this recording was focused on techno.Other comments / marks: <br /> <br />Coming up : The hit. Catchy. McCartney's voice sounds like he's in a television. There are some echo hand claps.10/10 <br /> <br />Temporary secretary: 9/10 <br /> <br />On the way: Despite the hilarious intro, a great and beautiful ballad. The lyrics are simple. The guitar's sweetness fits well with the pace. That television voice is heard again. 10/10 <br /> <br />Waterfall: That's relaxing,the most beautiful track in the album. It's perfect to listen looking at a waterfall like title <br />suggests. Marvellous. 10/10 <br /> <br />Nobody knows: The quality begins to fall. The most rocking song, average. The lyrics don't have a good sense. Paul distorts his voice. 5,5/10 <br /> <br />Front Parlour : This is instrumental. It can remind video games music, but it's interesting. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Summer's day song: \\"Someone's sleeping through a bad dream\\". The keyboards fit with sleep.The few singings are pleasant, but doesn't make the track perfect. 8/10 <br /> <br />Frozen jap: Instrumental. It's decent,gorgeous and followed by some hand claps. Terrific. 10/10 <br /> <br />Bogey music: Extremely awful, mediocre, silly. It reminds fifties rock. A shame! 0 /10 <br /> <br />Dark Room: McCartney uses hisclowny side again and repeats this sentence unusefuly \\"Come-a-come-along <br />with me to my dark room\\" Another waste! 0/10 <br /> <br />One of this days: This closing is acoustic and it's OK. Paul's vocals are more serious and enjoyable. 9/10 <br /> <br />My version doesn't have bonus tracks and came in a rare 2 in 1 with Red Rose Speedway ( Wings) made in Russia. There are some good songs, but the final result is only so-so, unhapilly. <br />Buy it especially if you're curious to see a frisky Paul McCartney. <br />

B00005Q45W|5.0|Leonard Cohen's spiritual awakening shines through these songs just as it always has but more so ... the years have been good to his consciousness and his poetry ... as much a mystic as a poet ... there are a couple of lines worthy of Mother Kali ... some reminiscent of his forever awareness as a lover ... and many reflecting the experience of awakening ...     Love Itself is a literal account of the moment of enlightenment ... if the younger listeners don't get it that's because it lies ahead on the path ...    This album does not disappoint for music, for poetry, for the mystic's truth ...
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This film wins your heart almost immediately.  The characters are endearing and allow you to identify with them, and you find yourself cheering for them from the start.  There is enough of a thread throughout the plot to tie every thing together.  The most winning performances are by Liam Neeson and Hugh Grant.  A real feel good movie.
0812550757|5.0|In spite of the zillion reviews for this book - much deserved and mostly inspired - I feel compelled to write one for me too. I love Ender's game. I loved still Ender's shadow. I thought that for the author to write the same story line from a different perspective filling in the gaps in different characters, happenings, it must have been quite challenging and somehow, it brought the whole story into a perspective that was very human. So, I followed it up with Speaker for the Dead. I saw that sequel coming at the end of Ender's game and I wanted to read it also. The images he evokes when he describes the piggies - their differences from our own understanding of life in itself - blew my mind away. I keep coming back to this particular way he describes the sunshine coming through the trees. It has a lovely calming effect on me when I need it the most in my most strained days at work. Those who enjoyed the action of Ender's game might not like this work because it is more contemplative. A must for anyone who loves exploring the boundries of our own imagination.
B000063DHL|5.0|Since this album came out many years ago when I was a wee youngster, I've argued, sometimes violently ;-), with numerous Iron Maiden fans that this is their best album. It's their best technical album by far, but the spirit of it is also fantastic. I'm female so no one takes me seriously, I guess, but I'm still convinced this is one their best and I'll continue to argue it. This album isn't as dark as the others, which may be why I like it so much, but if you can't love Wasted Years and Sea of Madness, then there is something wrong with you. I truly love every song on this album and Bruce Dickinson's vocals are _absolutely_beautiful_. If you can only buy one Iron Maiden album ever in your life, buy this one. I'll be buried with this CD.
B000002LCK|2.0|The rhythms in this music are so monotonous, songs go on and on and on, with no direction, as if the songwriter didn't know how to end the song.  Very disappointed in this because an intelligent person recommended this album and I expected much much better.    <br /> <br />Just a bunch of over-drugged and over-sexed punks, no role models here! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I don't recomend you buy this one.
B000AL730O|2.0|First of all, let me say that the really sad song, Riding To Vanity Fair is a flawless record.  It already may rank right up there with the Long and Winding Road in my book.<br /><br />By his own admission, McCartney has often been \\"in his element\\" aping the style of a popular artist or record.  In the case of Vanity Fair, it's pure Beck from Sea Change - down to using the instruments from Golden Age (track #1 coincidentally)<br /><br />Other songs are trivialized by trite, rushed lyrics - a worsening problem for Paul lately.  The handful of tunes with true promise here are reduced to throw-aways by throw away lyrics.<br /><br />Oh, and \\"Jenny Wren\\" isn't a sequal to Blackbird, it the sequal to \\"Put It There - and its irritating, to be kind.\\"
B000002H70|3.0|Interesting mind bending music.  It's different, but so depressing sometimes it's hard to take for more than 20 minutes.  The music does mirror the gigantic angst that young people have, so much pressure on them these days and so much love and loss.  This CD takes us through the ups and downs of an immature mind.  <br /> <br />
0060594888|5.0|In doing research for my book, The Power of Focus for College Students (released fall 2005), my co-author and I sat down to read 100 self-development titles to see what the experts from Dale Carnegie to Robert Kiyosaki to Og Mandino to Harvey Mackay to Donald Trump to Jack Canfield had to say.<br /><br />This book was the best encompassing how to be successful book we read. To this day I treat it like a bible by referring to it on a day to day basis when I need inspiration or want to sharpen the saw.<br /><br />If you want to reach a higher rung on the success ladder, this is your book!<br /><br />Luc d'Abadie<br /><br />PS - I had lunch with Jack a few months after the release of this book. Here's what he told me after I complimented him on how fantastic it was, \\"I have read over 3000 books on success, listened to over 1000 tapes and CDs and been to over a hundred seminars. The Success Principles is my findings combined with my personal life experience. In short, it is my life's work all in one book.\\"
0920668372|2.0|I remember having this book read to me often in school as a child. I remember hating this book. I hated the pictures, I didn't understand the story. I am 19 years old now and I can remember to this day how awful this book was...to a child. It's a tear-jerker for some adults and so they assume children will love it, but that's a bad assumption. I remember thinking it was potty book, that's all it ever was to me. Now one of my favorite potty books was, \\"Everyone Poops\\" by Taro Gomi. That would be a much better read and the pictures are great, very informative!
B00005JNX0|1.0|What a joke this film is, and I don't mean in the funny sense! I don't recall the last time I was this disapionted with a film.    Having waited for what seemed like a year for the release of this movie I rushed the the cinema and bought my ticket.    I nearly left half way through and demanded my money back!    The jokes are unfunny and the actors doing the voices (Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer) are just hopeless.    With the quality animated films being released these days (Shrek 1 and 2, the Incredibles etc...) DreamWorks should hang their heads in shame!    Aviod this film at all cost it's terrible!    No Really it's TERRIBLE!
B00006CXSS|5.0|When Band of Brothers was first announced by HBO I was very excited because Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg were both involved. I figured that since Hanks and Spielberg had both done a great job with Saving Private Ryan that this should be good as well. Well I was not prepared for how good this miniseries was. I was in front of the television every Sunday night to watch this masterpiece. I had never been much of a fan of films about World War II. In fact I am ashamed to say I didn't know that much about WWII except for what little I was taught in history class. I was fascinated with all of the experiences, both good and bad, these men went through. And what made this film even better was that these were real stories. These men really went through all this and so did many many more. And they did it for us. They did it for their country. These men grow and mature right before our eyes, going from young recruits to hardened battle scared soldiers. What I wasn't prepared for was the emotions this show would bring out in me. This film will make you laugh, make you angry, make you grow closer to the characters, and trust me on this one, it will make you cry. More than once I found myself crying because of the loss of someone I had grown attached to and knowing tha these were actual people that had died. And the chapter dealing with the holocaust and the camps will really open your eyes. Also before each chapter of the series we are treated to short \\"introductions\\" by the actual soldiers themselves. By seeing these men as they are today we grow even closer to the soldiers we see on the screen. Before I had seen Band of Brothers I had respect for the men and women who serve in our armed forces but I never really knew all that they had gone through. But now I have a deeper respect for every man and woman that has served and currently serves in our military and a deeper respect for those who have given their lives fighting for this country. THis DVD set is an excellent addition to any collection, In fact it is a must have for any collection. And the metal tin the set is encased in has to be one of if not the best packaging I have ever seen for a DVD set before.
0060751967|5.0|I read a lot, and I mean a LOT of paranormal romances, and this has to be one of my favorites! I loved this book!! The story was pretty original, and the primary characters really had loads of personality, even the secondary characters as well. The ONLY thing that I wasn't happy about was the very ending of this book. This is why I believe this story has to continue for this reason alone. I hesitate to say why, but for those who have read this book know what I'm talking about. For those of you who haven't read this book, then what are you waiting for???
1573223085|4.0|Where the big issues are concerned -- how to revitalize the U.S. economy in the age of outsourcing, why isn't our educational system working and how do we go about fixing it, etc. -- I've always felt that it was more important to raise the right questions than to come up with quick answers.  By that standard, this book is a winner.  I think most of us would agree that the world of work (on the personal as well as the national level) has changed radically in the last 20 years.  It's not a major logical leap to conclude that, rather than choosing to cultivate the skills and abilities that led to success in the \\"information age,\\" we should broaden our range.  It's possible to argue with the author's list of \\"six senses,\\" but they're suggestions rather than prescriptions.  (Nor are they touchy-feely nonsense removed from the practical world:  the concept of \\"story,\\" for example, is something that every spin doctor understands.)  His personal anecdote about the drawing class has immense implications:  we view the world (physical and mental) through a fog of preconceptions, and the ability to see what is REALLY there is crucial.  I felt that the book wasn't as coherent and focused as his earlier one, but it's thought-provoking and stimulating -- and a good read, too.
158799190X|3.0|REVIEW:   This book tends to elicit very strong opinions about its quality (both very good and very bad) so it is important to know which camp you are in before you purchase it or you may be very disappointed.  I found that both the very bullish and the very bearish reviews have significant merit.  On the plus side Taleb aggressively addresses a topic that many readers will be interested in - randomness in our daily lives.  He discusses many important concepts that are not known or at least not very well understood by the general public and experts alike.  These include: 1) that uncertainty and luck play a large role in the outcomes of human activities (much more than most people think); 2) that a correlation between two types of events does not necessarily mean that one causes the other; 3) that statistics and the rare random event are poorly understood by almost everyone; 4) that small differences in performance and ability can cause very large differences in the rewards or difficulties that people obtain in life; and 5) that humans are very irrational beings and are not very good at thinking probabilistically and understanding the probabilities of even everyday events rationally.  All of these are important points that I commend Taleb for bringing to our attention. <br /> <br />However, there are significant drawbacks to this book, which to some readers will make the book significantly unenjoyable or even impossible to read.  While it did not significantly bother me, Taleb does have an attitude or style which at times tends to the snobbish.  The author repeatedly reminds readers that he is well traveled, is a \\"voracious\\" reader, pursues his exercise routines \\"assiduously\\", and is from upper class Mediterranean roots.  Further, at some points in the book, he writes from a bitterness and contempt (which he admits) for journalists, economics, others in his profession, and generally those who are not \\"literate persons\\".  In general, I would have preferred that Talebleft most of these personal issues out of the book and that he have written it with a little more rigor.  But in fairness Taleb clearly warns the reader that his book is a personal memoir and not a treatise.  Unfortunately, I believe this is mostly a cop-out to avoid addressing his critics on the merits.  The book has the look and feel of a treatise, and I was hoping for a treatise, but it doesn't deliver.   <br /> <br />STRENGTHS: Addresses an important topic not well understood and not written about enough; most people will benefit from a better understanding of the major concepts brought out in this book; the author is well read and not afraid to offend and pursue the material aggressively <br /> <br />WEAKNESSES: I hate to say it because I find the author likeable in many ways, but too much of the author's personality comes through and what it suggests to me is that he may have significant insecurities and passive aggressive issues that may even be pathological; many readers will have a hard time getting past the author's aggressive style or perceived \\"bad attitude\\", some readers may even see the book as political; the book is \\"a personal memoir and not a treatise\\" and thus lacks the rigor that many would expect; the author takes great pains to try to avoid addressing any substantial criticism (this is the first book I've read where the author feels the need to attack the credibility of Amazon reviewers calling them \\"unqualified\\" to comment on his book) <br />
B000AL730Y|5.0|Macca does it again, I am now into my second listen and so far I think it ranks up there with his best. The production is simple which enhances the songs, even the ballads. Fine Line is great but it's just the start, I think it gets better as it goes. Friends to Go is my favorite but as with all Macca albums I'm sure that will change. Much different from Driving Rain, but I think its better.
B000B5XOYI|2.0|A couple of months ago I bought the box set of the first four Batman movies for the ridiculously low price of 21.98.  I couldn't believe how low the price was.  Well, now we know why.  They were simply trying to move out merchandise that will be obsolete beginning on Oct 28.    So, now that I have all four movies, am I going to be willing to shell out an addtional 50.00 to 75.00 dollars for these special editions?  In a word, no.  I'm sure a lot of Bat-geeks out there will, but I for one am not one of them.  What exactly am I getting?  Audio commentary and a few documentaries which I might watch once?  No thanks.  Improved picture and sound quality?  Negligible.  The pictiure and sound are good enough already.    And to be totally honest, all of the Batman movies (including \\"Batman Begins\\") were sort of a letdown for me.  The first and second films had great cinematography and acting, but the action scenes were not that strong.  In \\"Batman\\" it was never explained how the thugs got up on the roof of the cathedral in the last act.  That really annoyed me.  In \\"Batman Returns\\", the Penguin running for mayor, and the Penguin army with rocket launchers, and especially the penguin pall-bearers, was just stupid.  \\"Batman Forever\\" had terrible action scenes.  I couldn't even tell what was happening.  \\"Batman and Robin\\"?  It was by far the worst (and gayest) super-hero movie of all time.  It made \\"Mystery Men\\" look like \\"Citizen Kane\\".  It was so monumentally bad that it simultaneously sunk the careers of Alicia Silverstone, Chris O'Donnell, Uma Thurmon (who later recovered), and even Arnold.  Why does Batman reveal his identity in EVERY FREAKING MOVIE???  Especially to his girlfriends?  Have you ever known a woman who could keep a secret?    ...but I digress...    Warner Bros has simply learned the marketing ploy that's been mastered by George Lucas:  get geeks to buy the same movies over and over and over by promising something new, something they can't live without.  Doesanyone really believe that in a year or two, \\"The Star Wars Ultimate Edition 12 Disc Box Set, with Enhanced Enhanced Special Effects\\" won't be hitting the market in time for Christmas\\"?    Did you notice that on Oct 28, \\"Batman Begins\\" will be released also, but it WON'T be included as part of this collection?  That's right kids, if you want all all 5 movies in one box set, your going to have to wait another year or two, when Warner will be releasing \\"Batman: The Entire Saga So Far, Not Counting the New One\\", perfectly timed to coincide with the release of \\"Batman Continues...\\"
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|The O.C. Season Two provided more proof of why The O.C. is one of the best dramas on television today. Season two gave us more of what made season one so great and then kicked it up a notch. Great storylines, great performances and more great music. Characters lives were thrown into turmoil. Some overcome obstacles and some are blind sided by events that will change their lives and the lives of those around them forever. And of course no great series is complete with out the shocking season finale. Season two had me glued to the tv screen every Thursday night without hesitation. It is shows like The O.C. that make television worth watching. And as long as we continue getting storylines as great as Seasons One & Two, I hope The O.C. continues on for many seasons to come.
B00097A5HW|4.0|I like Tortura (both versions and videos - super sexy) - great song, great duo - the other songs are good but Tortura is the best
0895260131|5.0|This book is a MUST READ for anybody who thinks Islam is just another good religion with a few \\"extremists.\\"  Extremism is at the very core of the religion, and there is a very real danger that Islam will kill or enslave millions of us.
B000002OMN|5.0|Sixteen years after the release of the original \\"Bat Out of Hell\\", Meat Loaf and Jim Steinmann reunited to produce this excellent continuation.  As on the original \\"Bat\\", Steinmann has once again written all of the songs on this cd, and they definitely have Steinmann's unique flair for lots of guitars, drums, and harmony vocals.   <br /> <br />Steinmann's signature track on this cd is the 13+ minute-long \\"I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)\\".  This song is very similar to earlier Steinmann/Meat Loaf collaborations in its length,the use of a female co-lead singer, and almost rock opera-like sound.  Meat Loaf's rendition of \\"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\\" sounds much better than when Steinmann included it on his own solo album.  The other songs, such as \\"Out of the Frying Pan\\", \\"Wasted Youth\\", \\"Everything Louder Than Everything Else\\" and \\"Good Girls Go to Heaven\\" contain that special Steinmann/Meat Loaf sound that we've all come to know and enjoy.  Each of these songs runs at least six minutes; another Steinmann/Meat Loaf trademark. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this great disc.  Steinmann's lyrics and  Meat Loaf's voice combine to make a cd that will surely remain a classic for a long time.
B000002LJW|5.0|JOURNEYMAN is a great latter-day Eric Clapton album. Here, he successfully blends the bluesy sounds of his 70s/early 80s work with his mid 80s pop style to create one of his best 80s albums. The songs are all top-notch despite the humility of the title.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|And only 2 songs over 8 minutes long?  Has Sigur Ros gone pop?  Hardly, but this is their most accesible and listener friendly album yet.  Ignore the \\"bad\\" reviews that say this is their worst album.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but mine is that \\"Takk...\\" is their best album.  The vocals sound better than ever and not nearly as monotone as they have on past albums.  The music is tighter, lusher, and more focused, as opposed to the snail paced drifting that happened far too often on \\"( )\\".  This album is immaculate in every way, from the music to the packaging.  It's also their most mystical and joyful album, making it their most uplifting.  And yes, there are hooks. Just listen to Hoppipolla, their first song that I could imagine hearing on the radio. The best, brightest, and most unpredictable album from an amazing band that still doesn't get enough press.
B00005R62K|5.0|This album was born about five years before I was so I can only imagine how fans were impacted by this one when it first came out. I gotta say though, it must have been INTENSE! I personally had owned BRITISH STEEL, SAD WINGS, and a few others long before I ever picked this one up. Then one day I stumbled across SAINTS IN HELL and I realized that I had missed one of the nastiest recordings of all time. That song is so f'ing great it makes me shake! SO GOOD! The rest of this album is a masterpiece, one of PRIESTS finest for sure. The album progresses, starting out with some Priest brand hard rockers like EXCITER and BETTER BY YOU, then slowly decends into a breed of dark metal that had never been touched on in 1978. BEYOND THE REALMS OF DEATH reinvented the metal ballad, it is dark, gloomy, and invigorating at the same time. The story is that this song caused a couple of kids to commit suicide in the early eighties, which sprung a lot of controversy against this song. Well, it must all be a matter of opinion, because though the lyrics speak of death... I find this to be a beautiful and empowering song. There are a bunch of other great songs that I don't have time to mention, but they are all good. This album is an essential for any metal fan.
B00005N5RM|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband; it has always been one of his favorites.  I like it, too!  It is a great movie.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I have to admit that I was blown away by this CD.  This is a DT album that does not have to grow on you to like it.  There are powerful riffs, strong musical interludes, and lyrics all over this CD.  It feels like another theme album similar to Scenes from a Memory (although not as operatic).  \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" starts off as nice ballad before it explodes into a powerful jamming session by DT and \\"As I Am\\" starts this album off in a hard core direction.  This \\"Dying Soul\\" keeps you moving until we slow down a little with DT's characteristic dark ballads in Vacant.  A superb instrumental work in \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" takes the listener on a ride through an awesome DT jam session. This edition from DT is not for those who like short songs since only one song is under 8 minutes. This album doesn't get boring though.  It seems that DT has matured well with this release and I am looking forward to Octavarium.
B0007Y08QA|1.0|You are kidding me.... right? <br />From the very beginning we're all sitting there thinking this better not be another Fight Club. And boy were we in for a treat.  <br /> <br />I dont understand how anyone can watch this movie and convince themselves that its worthy of much praise. If anything, I was shocked by Bale's determination and his dieticians abilities... but where does anyone come off awarding this (Sundance festival... insert every other international film festival). <br />I was annoyed when Johnny Depp had a go in Secret Window and Im even more frustrated with this.  <br /> <br />If anything (as generic and commercial as it may sound) it highlights just how innovative and influential Fight Club was. <br />  <br />To some of these stunned fish out there... have you seen Fight Club?????  <br /> <br />You know what really made me mad... the big block letters on the front of the DVD cover... FIGHT CLUB MEETS MOMENTO <br />(how stupid is that.. might aswell write... HE GOES TO JAIL BOY GETS KILLED... tell us the whole story why dont you!!!).  <br />Doesnt anyone else think previews and advertisements these days reveal too much. Or are we just getting wiser.   <br />
B00005JLK1|4.0|The scenes of \\"horror\\" aren't as numerous as some horror films. It's no slasher. But, it's a great watch for a dark evening. Plus, it has one of the best beginnings of ANY scary movie EVER. I enjoyed the actual story. How many scary movies can boast that? The viewer gets a few true suprises along the way, too! Love that.
B000002J0B|5.0|As I understand it, for years hardcore ZEP fans have argued over which album was better ZOSO or HOUSES. To me this is an argument that can't be won.<br /><br />Me, my favorite would have to be IV. Its way more solid.<br />But tommorow I may just say, whatever, my favorite is II. Maybe even I.<br /><br />HOUSES, is not the heaviest, its not even the lightest (I give that title to III.) HOUSES is its own unique body, just like every other ZEP, only on this one ZEP was trying something different. They didn't want to be taken TOO seriously.<br /><br />For some (believe it or not) for me, this was initially hard to swallow.  When I first got this I was still coming off of the rush of IV. I had no idea what to make of this CD. It seemed silly to me.<br /><br />First of all, heres my breakdown....<br /><br />SONG REMAINS: not to bad, but not to great.<br />RAIN SONG: get out of here. This song is TOO LONG.<br />THE HILLS: BAM! Something to get my blood pumping.<br />THE CRUNGE: Um, I dont know. I'd rather just do some James Brown.<br />DANCING DAYS: ROCKS! I thought this thing was never gonna get intense.<br />DYER MAKER: (JERMAKAH) I can dig this cuz it makes the ladies shake it.<br />NO QUARTER: The only song worthy of epic status.<br />THE OCEAN: You guys saved it right here. The powerhouse. Make sure this ones up loud enough (at least) to hear John Bonham count off at the beggining.  No less volume than that.<br /><br />See, now this album lacks the intensity of previous albums for me. Its still an outstanding album, but... for the first time there was \\"filler.\\" I guess I realized exactly what they wanted me to. These guys are only human (although they are still possessed with something here, they'd get more earthy later on down the road.)<br /><br />Somebody who is jonesin' for more ZEP may need to adjust to this when coming off of a I-IV high, but it will grow on you. After all you always gonnaa need more ZEP!
B00005RZV4|2.0|Only after buying this cd, I found how out a very significant portion of the show was taken out of this recording...why? I have no idea, but it kinda sucks. <br /> <br />As far as the music itself, it's incredible, and the quality of sound was remastered, no complaints there. But I strongly reccomend buying the DVD (which has everything) instead of this.
B000002OMN|5.0|Bat Out of Hell II is what introduced me to Meat Loaf.  This album is a musical, emotional and lyrical masterpiece to say the least.  This rock and roll operatic ride takes you through questions of love, questions of life, and just plain having fun.  Jim Steinman knows how to capture emotion. After dismal releases like Dead Ringer and Bad Attitude, this is a return to the highly successful formula of Bat Out of Hell for Meat Loaf and Jim.  You can envision yourself in these songs.<br /><br />\\"I'd Do Anything for Love\\" is a rock and roll legendary song with guitar, piano, chorus, passion, pleading, duet, and Meat Loaf all wrapped in an explosive release of desire.  Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through reminds us how music helps us remember events.  \\"Object in the Rear View Mirror\\" is a power ballad of dark reminiscing.  There is an interesting lyrical prose in Wasted Youth that Steinman tried to do in Dead Ringer. The album gets loud with \\"Everything Louder than Everything Else\\" and \\"Out of the Frying Pan\\" until it hits the brakes with a soft ballad of unfortunates \\"Lost Boys and Golden Girls\\".<br /><br />This album is rock and roll pumping through your veins!  If you believe that music is more than just notes on a page and cute lyrics, this is the album for you.
B000002C25|2.0|The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because this album has a very few decent songs but the rest.... AARGH!    Remember the song \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\" from the album of the same name?  Basically what we have here is that song over and over again, except without a catchy melody but with even more distortion, a zillion guitars and noise.  Oasis thinks if they create lots of noise then they will be legendary, but they are forgetting that they are in the category of popular music.  Not unpopular noise.    Please read the bad and fair reviews on this album before considering buying it because I think they say a lot more about the album then the good reviews posted by fans who think anything Oasis is good.  No way!  Definitely Maybe is an excellent album, Morning Glory is good, and then this?!  The songs all sound the same, most are way too long, and they have a lot of bad guitar distortion, repitition, but nothing precise and good.  Except for the single \\"Don't Go Away,\\" which is an excellent ballad, but you've heard that song already I'm sure.  Don't buy this album for that song.  The title track is decent too, but nearly everything else sucks!  I gave this album at least 6 spins and really should have started liking it by that point, but this album is beyond salvation.    I would hate to imagine what the later Oasis albums sound like, and given their lack of radio play on any later songs, I would imagine that they are even worse.  I've heard other fans say that Be Here Now is the \\"last great Oasis album.\\"  Well, if being cocky and producing songs that are way too long because you think you are legendary is greatness, then please spare me.
B000AL730O|5.0|I got this album today (had to wait in front of the store until it opened), and I have to say I'm blown away. With the exception of \\"Run Devil Run\\" and \\"Unplugged,\\" in other words, of all his original albums, it's definitely his best since \\"Band On The Run\\" (much better than \\"Flaming Pie\\" or \\"Driving Rain\\" or the late Wings and 80s stuff).<br /><br />Some of these songs, especially Anyway (which I find an incredible song and certainly one of Paul's solo highlights), are classic McCartney. There's a lot of experimental touches and varied instrumental choices that build up the tracks far beyond the usual good Paul song. Credit for this has to go to Nigel Godrich, who produced one of the best records of the modern era with Beck's \\"Sea Change,\\" and makes all the difference on this one. His influence is everywhere, even if Macca plays most of the instruments. The orchestration, the mood, is all him - and it's briliant (sounds like nothing Macca has done before). In short, this album is a meeting of two geniuses, one from the 60s/70s and one from the 90s/00s.<br /><br />There are weak tracks - I think Fine Line is fluffy radio pop in comparison to the deeper tracks on the album, and English Tea is a ridiculous homage to traditional English things, reminds me of the Kinks' \\"Village Green Preservation Society\\" but without the relevance that album had of coming out in the middle of the 60s cultural revolution.<br /><br />Even so, the stronger tracks on here like Friends To Go (which reminds me of Smile Away a bit), Jenny Wren (which is definitely daughter of Blackbird, and a damn worthy one at that), Too Much Rain, and the brilliant Anyway (somewhat reminiscent, as a reviewer pointed out, of Golden Slumbers) more than overshadow any weak parts. Also, it's true the album doesn't rock at all, but this is a moody, atmospheric piece. It's not supposed to. If you want rocking Paul, listen to \\"Run Devil Run.\\" (which is a good idea, since I would call that his best since BOTR)<br /><br />In conclusion, I love it. It's Paul McCartney at the forefront of music again in a way he hasn't been for a long, long time. If only the masses understood and got into it...and finally found out what they've been missing all these years.) <br /> <br />In conclusion, I love it.

B000002JSJ|5.0|ACHILLES is no doubt the heaviest of Zeppelin, and thats pretty heavy, man. An epic track that almost touches twelve minutes, its almost like IMMIGRANT SONG (from Zep III) only mutated beyond control. It will ROCK YOUR FU***NG SOCKS OFF!!!!<br /><br />The rest is less than extraordinary, but still not bad. FOR YOUR LIFE sort of drones on. The song is about cocaine, perhaps they could have sped it up a little more? Iffy.<br /><br />NOBODYS FAULT BUT MINEis the other big song. You are more likely to hear this one on the radio than the mighty ACHILLES. Though it is pretty loud and hard, it doesn't have balls like other ZEPPELIN powerhouses. Its a great song though, actually the first song I dug on from this album.<br /><br />The rest is all decent, but no way KILLER material. Zeppelin was still a force at this point, but they were fading away.
B000002LIM|5.0|I love this cd.  It has great emotional appeal to me.  Its songs give me a sense of darkness, lonliness, and wonder.
0451209338|2.0|The book was well written.  The subject matter was typical when it  involves Israeli spies vs Palestian spies.  Israelis are the good guys, oh so clever, Palestians the not so noble ones. The Israelis are the butchers that are just misunderstood in their search for peace.The Palestians are a miserable lot of complainers just because their families have been killed and their land stolen by the Israelis. The Israelis are the heros and winners. Who would have thunk! <br />Doug Wallick
B00005A1PR|5.0|Beautiful by India Arie is superb. The song opens to the slow strumming of an acoustic guitar and the steady lethargic beating of drums. The guitar becomes a constant friend throughout your journey and is the backbone of the song, going low on occasions but its presence is never lost. The hollow beats of the drums provides solace; the soothing heart beat a child hears against a mother's bosom. Her deep soulful voice is intoxicating as it carries you slowly to your utopia. Swaying to the rhythm of her voice you are taken on an odyssey where the green grass is lush and the line between the sky and land is intangible. Her raspy tone has the soft quality of a woman telling her daughter of a whimsical far away land as a lullaby. Her voice entices feelings of tranquility and peace. The lyrics are simple, better to get the actual feeling from the song than to overcomplicate it with unnecessary word usage. She talks of self-discovery and the realization that you've outgrown your cramped living space. A realization so blunt it's like removing a picture frame off of a wall it's been on for 30 years, seeing the contrast of what is and what used to be. India Arie is among the many like Erika Badu, Lauryn Hill, Musiq and Jill Scott whose Neo Soul music is rooted in the traditional soul music of the 70's.  The journey is everlasting, as is the feeling of the song. It's a breath of fresh air from all the mechanical computer-generated pop that litters the radio. <br />-Aaleeyah
B000000OQF|5.0|There's the age-old age in the record industry that bands have a lifetime to write their debut record but 2-3 years to write the follow-up. With Guns N Roses, they really must've taken awhile to get Appetite recorded cause there's barely any missteps(I say barely, there's one on here). Unapologetically in your face, this was the right album in 1987 and it's still feels right now. <br /> <br />Welcome to the Jungle: Their first single(although It's So Easy might've been a teaser first single), it's got a great delay-laden intro, big guitars and angry vocals. Song still sounds fresh today. 9/10 <br /> <br />It's So Easy: Lyrically I hope women don't check it out cause it's not the most flattering. One thing that it does showcase is Axl's great clean vocals when he sings the chorus. Good song. 8/10 <br /> <br />Nightrain: Catchy guitar intro with lyrics about alcoholism. Great guitar throughout the song including its catchy chorus riff. 8/10 <br /> <br />Out Ta Get Me: Shows Axl's insecurity and paranoia, and maybe small amounts of ego? Other than that, it's still sleazy-like rock and other than maybe Aerosmith or Stones, no one else does it better. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Mr. Brownstone: The \\"Bo-Diddley rhythm\\" starts it off with fret noise until its catchy riff starts off the song proper. It's a song that might get lost in the shuffle of the other popular album tracks but give it a listen and you'll find it's actually good. 8/10 <br /> <br />Paradise City: The classic fast-picked intro turns into a big stadium filling song with lyrics about the troubles of living in cities. All of it turns into a big double-time guitar freak out by axeman Slash. 9/10 <br /> <br />My Michelle: There's a certain disturbing feeling of this song, very slow and primal feeling with lyrics about a troubled girl. I like it although like Mr. Brownstone you might skip it. 8/10 <br /> <br />Think About You: Not the misstep but it's not awesome, but then again it's rather underrated. But seeing as how there's a big song after this, most likely you'll skip it but check it out anyway. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Sweet Child O' Mine: Probably one of the most catchiest and oddly addicting riff in rock, along with Crazy Train and Satisfaction. I actually found myself repeating the song just to hear the intro again. Then of course the classic mini-solos, the big solo come after. Great. 10/10 <br /> <br />You're Crazy: Given the acoustic treatment for unofficial followup Lies, here it's nice, big and electric. In a way I prefer the acoustic version but it's still good anyway so no harm done. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Anything Goes: My god do I hate this song. This is the misstep I was talking about. With lyrics naturally about sex, it's got gritty and sleazy written all over it, if only it was a good song. 6/10 <br /> <br />Rocket Queen: Great snaky guitar riff with lyrics that to me I guess it's an older woman? The \\"moaning\\" bridge although oddly likable, feels out of place. Then we have the big arena filling section with clean guitar and ballad-like pace until it gets big and anthemic. Great closer. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Very few albums have the consistency of this album. One complaint can be that there's no breaks. It's all rock straight through so songs might bleed into each other but the songs are so strong anyway. This is definately an album to check out(and for guitarists, certain tracks being essential to learn).
B000003TAR|5.0|Yeah, everybody did Nevermind. It was like they couldn't help it. In the early nineties like it or not you owned that album. I bought it and I was NINE years old! I didn't even know why initially.<br /><br />I was on the band wagon with these guys until a few years later when they released this the follow up. I liked HEART SHAPE BOX but that was it and eventually just lost the CD and didn't listen to Nirvana for at least five years.<br /><br />Now I find it even better than Nevermind.  This could just possibly be because I haven't heard it as many times, but no... I find this one way more diverse.  Better song writing too.<br /><br />Still sad drug music, but what the hell, thats the stuff i grew up on. Nirvana and The Doors.<br /><br />Tracks 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 and 12 all get A grades. The rest are B's. Well not as heavy as my boys AC DC this is still another timeless classic from my day, the 1990's.
B000929AJQ|4.0|I would describe this as NIN's most pared-down, minimalist album since \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\".  Some of the tracks soar (\\"Hand that Feeds\\", \\"Only\\", \\"All the Love in the World\\" stand out to me), but overall it lacks the dense, endlessly-layered feel of albums like the \\"Downward Spiral\\", where songs almost seemed to blend into each other.  Still a worthwile effort though, and nice to see that the first single (\\"Hand that Feeds\\") thumbs its nose at authority (\\"what if this whole crusade's a charade...\\")--even at 40 it's good to know Trent hasn't mellowed out!
B000AL730O|5.0|Having been a radio announcer circa '72-78, I have loved and followed the music of Paul McCartney for 35 years.  Through the highs and lows, I have realized that:  (1)  Paul McCartney is not a musical \\"god\\", and (2)  That the non-repeatable success of the Beatles guarantees that there will ALWAYS be someone somewhere who will be \\"disappointed\\" in what he does.  For those who will get over their fantasy of Macca as the Mecca of pop music, get their head out of the clouds, and really listen to this CD rather than rushing to judgment, you'll find something very reminiscent of the \\"White Album\\" in texture, tone, production, vocalizations, and sonic surprises.  This is the best he's done in 35 years, no contest, hands down.  It's great -  well recorded, produced, exquisitely vocalized, energetic, and quite enjoyable.  Never once was I even remotely tempted to hit the \\"skip\\" button on my CD player.  So, take Macca off the pedestal of your fantasy expectations and savor this treat!  After repeated listenings, it only gets better!

0312995423|3.0|Working my way backward through Dan Brown's books, I have finally arrived at his first novel, \\"Digital Fortress\\", and...well, this novel is obviously a first effort. Many reviewers have trounced this book thoroughly, but I won't be so harsh-every writer has to start somewhere, and \\"Digital Fortress\\" still makes a passable airplane/airport book. Readers will recognize the themes that Brown has used in every one of his books: boy/girl protagonists aroused from their routines at the last minute to be sent on a quest, the significance of which isn't realized until the evil bad guy-assassin shows himself; a conspiracy from the highest levels, and conspirators whose nefarious plans begin to cascade out of control as the unwitting protagonists expose the deception. This is formulaic niche stuff-nothing wrong with that as long as the reader sticks to the paperback editions and avoids investing in the hardcover editions.<br /><br />Where Brown struggles is in writing life into his characters. With the exception (in my opinion) of a couple of the characters in his second novel, \\"Deception Point\\", all of Brown's characters are flat devices for moving his plot along. While Brown's researchers have dug up plenty of tidbits for him to use in his plots, his books have none of the sophistication and depth of a le Carre or a Ludlum. All of the elements are present, but Brown either lacks the skill or the discipline to pull all of the elements together into a sophisticated story. The plot of \\"Digital Fortress\\" is silly, a Much Ado About Nothing, really, but he does manage to keep the tension high enough to distract the reader from the implausibility of his plot. If you are interested in following Brown's career or have a long layover at the airport, read \\"Digital Fortress\\". Otherwise, pass.

0783226888|2.0|Let me first start off by saying that Richard Gere is in my opinion a very so, so actor and in this movie, his crazy irish accent bugged me.and seemed forced. But, still, it's a descent movie thanks to Bruce Willis, perfect for the vilain in this movie. Jack Black also makes a short cameo but Bruce makes sure he doesn't stay alive for long.  <br />The movie is basically about a prisoner released from prison to track down a man that only him and his girlfriend can identify.  <br />And then, comes a very average move with some good scenes. all resulting around Bruce Willis. The problem for me is that at times, I wasn't cheering Richard Gere on whatsoever. That could have to do with his acting. On the other hand, Willis is great and very effective and also..very cool. <br />But, what looks like it's going to be a good suspense movie ends out being like all action movies. and that my friend is something I seriously am tired of. Now, that I think of it, I own this movie. You know what that means. Hello Blockbuster!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|After listening to gosoli, which is the one of the 3 songs ive heard from this album, i thought ok, yeah, its OK nothing too special. Now after after few days ive realised just how brilliant this song is. God Damn, sigur ros(Victory Rose) are easily one of best bands os today, not too comercially succesfull but in the arts department theyre up theyre. <br />up with radiohead etc...
B000AL730O|5.0|This guy could have retired in the early '70s when The Beatles broke up and would still be considered one of the greatest of all time and one for the ages, but he kept going. I'm familiar with all the stuff McCartney has had on the radio in the '70s and '80s, but beyond more recent stuff like \\"My Brave Face\\" and a lot of FLAMING PIE, I have been underwhelmed somewhat. But I do have BAND ON THE RUN, McCARTNEY, RAM, FLOWERS IN THE DIRT and VENUS AND MARS, all of which I consider to be right up there with his work with The Beatles.     After playing this I was pleasantly surprised that Paul is pulling off work like this at this point in his career. It is just a treat when radio today is full of useless filler. It's good, really good. The chord changes here go from major to minor and back again with little warning, and the subtle changes are incredibly creative. But the difference this time around is that McCartney is playing in a reflective, almost dark mood. In other words, this is not the typical McCartney 'thumbs up!' affair. Credit the producer Nigel Godrich for this, who has done an awesome job here. (Godrich produces Radiohead and Beck.)     Don't bash \\"Fine Line\\"---I hated it the first ten times I listened to it online, but man, it's his best single since \\"My Brave Face.\\" The lyrics are more in-depth than the typical Paul pop single. And the strings and piano exchange is incredible.     How about the ending coda in \\"How Kind of You\\"....really dramatic. This song takes a few spins, but I can't stop playing it now. This one has to be about Linda and perhaps the night she passed: \\"The thoughtfulness you showed has made/A difference in my life/I won't forget how unafraid/You were that long dark night\\".     \\"Jenny Wren\\" is really good---read those lyrics like 'She saw poverty/Breaking up a home/Wounded warriors/Took her song away'....this is good stuff.     \\"At the Mercy\\" where he sings, 'Sometimes I'd rather run and hide/Than stay and face the fear inside'....     \\"Friends to Go\\"---an incredible musical take-off tribute of George Harrison---you almost think it's George singing harmonies as this song is so Harrison-like. One of my favorite tracks on the album.     \\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\" is unchartered territory for McCartney, sounding quite bitter against a former friend. (For kicks I imagine this being Yoko.)     And is Paul channeling Linda in \\"Anyway\\"??? He sings, \\"If we could be, closer longer/That would help me, help me so much/We can cure each other's sorrow/Won't you please, please, please get in touch\\". It's a stretch, but the only thing this album lacks are Linda's harmonies, which I miss quite a bit.     CHAOS AND CREATION takes a few spins to settle in, but for me that has always been a sign of a solid work.     Highly recommended.
B000062X90|5.0|Wishbone Ash never reached the level of success as other more well known groups of the day, but this album deserves a place in rock history. This early 70's recording sounds as good today as it did then. Every song is a winner. Think I will go listen to it now!

6305069611|3.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on the 1963 novel of the same name by Walter Tevis.<br /><br />This science-fiction movie is about Thomas Jerome Newton (David Bowie, his film debut).  He is a humanoid extraterrestrial who comes to Earth to get water for his drought-stricken planet.  Newton starts a high technology company to get the money he needs to build a return spacecraft, and meets Mary-Lou (Candy Clark), a girl who he falls in love with.  He is exposed to human greed and corruption and, as well, becomes involved with the two main vices of humans: booze and sex (used for coping).<br /><br />This is an artsy type of sci-fi movie that is definitely not for every type of taste.  Thus, this movie will be reacted differently by two types of people:<br /><br />(1) Those who like their movies more concrete and obvious.<br /><br />Such people will not like this movie.  They will not appreciate its long length and slow-moving, boring pace.  It will probably be difficult to understand.  As well, they probably won't appreciate the large amount of gratuitous sex in it and its minimal special effects.<br /><br />Possible rating by these people (assuming they see all of the movie): 2 stars.<br /><br />(2) Those who don't mind artsy films that require you to think (such as myself).<br /><br />I found that this movie had a unique and engaging style, a different visual design, and a creative use of music (classical and old favorites).  I liked the fact that it was strange and different.  The major problem I found was that it took an intelligent sci-fi novel and turned it into a surreal sex romp.<br /><br />Possible rating by these people: 4 stars<br /><br />(My overall rating is the average of the above two ratings.)<br /><br />David Bowie looks the part of an extraterrestrial and this heightened my visual experience of this movie.  Fans of his should appreciate his performance.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that James Lovell, Commander of Apollo 13, appears in this movie.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD released by the studio Fox Lorber in Oct. 2002 is practically perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has minimal extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a different type of science fiction movie that will be reacted to differently by different types of viewers!!<br /><br />(1976;  2 hr 20 min;  widescreen)<br /><br />+++++movie.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD released by the studio Fox Lorber in Oct. 2002 is practically perfect in picture and sound quality.

Turned out to be a very captivating story with a powerful message.  Both my husband and I thought it did a great job of exploring a very unfortunate subculture of our country. Norton was very believeable in his role as a white supremecist.

B0002JJBZY|4.0|As with so many young people growing up in the 1960's, the original Star Trek television series became a part of who I eventually became as an adult. Ever since, I wondered if it would become practical to own all those original episodes for convenient viewing. Over the years, I saw the huge VHS collection come and go, but it's size and cost made it prohibitive to own. Then came the DVD versions that still had only a couple of episodes per disk - the same reservations applied. Finally, the entire three year collection is available in a small package at a reasonable price. While I have not watched all of the many disks yet (who wants to rush a thing like this?), what I have seen is well organized, packaged, and transferred from the film originals. Picture and sound is as good as can be expected from something that was probably not expected to last at the time of its creation. <br /> <br />The boxed set consists of three heavy plastic clam-shell boxes, each containing a printed episode directory and guide (a fold-out style booklet) and a high-density folding disk carrier. There are four episodes per DVD, and the basic specials include the 'next week' trailers and some basic audio options. Special features are included in each set, but I have not watched these yet. <br /> <br />Within the constraints of the DVD medium, I don't know of a more affordable and practical way of owning this collection.
B0002858YS|4.0|This has to be one of the most honest pop rock cd's I've listened to, ever. Most pop music seems fake and over-elaborated, this sounds fresh and real. This album is a real treat, I would recommend it 100%. Midnite show and Smile like you mean it are my favorites. there is a lot of contrast, kinda like somber or dark lyrics with upbeat tempos. I dig it. I gave it four stars because there are only two or three songs that I just don't seem to get in to them at all.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|'Metropolis' is absolutely one of the greatest films ever made. Fritz Lang's vision of an apocalyptic future, is one of the best examples of cinematic art in existence. Time has done nothing to reduce the film's impact. It is probably the most electrifying film to date.<br /><br />The story is set in 2026, in a time where society has split into two classes. The workers, who simply exist below ground level, keeping the city functioning, and the rulers of the city and the upper-class citizens who live in luxury above. The ruler's son, Freder, while indulging at the 'Club of the Sons', is curious when a woman from down below visits, surrounded by a group of young boys. It is at this moment that Freder is moved to visit the worker's environment. He tells his father of the distress that he finds and eventually becomes part of a rebellion that will finally unite both classes.<br /><br />What Fritz Lang created in 1926 is truly incredible. It is mind-boggling at how modern it still is. And as far as art is concerned, this is a film that is bursting at the seams. It is however, ridiculous that the film was labelled as a flop on its release. It is even more outrageous that a good chunk of footage from the original print of the film is now irretrievably lost because the film was re-edited. Although it has been restored as much as possible, it is such a shame that it is incomplete.<br /><br />'Metropolis' is a film that has made more sense and has become more understood as time has passed. It is now greatly praised and has rightly been given the honour as the greatest German film from the silent era.
B000002H4Q|5.0|its amazing how versatile this album.....i can tell from everything including its sleeve art...its simply gorgeous how they put the enlarged mouth in the cover and the type of font they use...it was the first album i listened from Cure about 1990 or 1991 back in high school !!!i was 14 yrs!!i turned to listen to this music when everybody was getting into Nirvana and all that grunge stuff...this album is awesome...Robert Smith has the most excentric voice in rock history and he had it on its best shape on this album....i love the entry track THE KISS  with all the swirling wah guitar and the drumming and the overdistorted bass....it set pace for many bands on alternative/indie music there are deffinitely some fillers on tha album such as catch which is completely boring...torture which doesnt fit well....the prefect girl... <br />but truly there are some masterpieces as well such as if only tonight we could sleep which is so eastern influenced....just like heaven which i hear nowadays and sounds much better than most music on the radio ....the snakepit sounds as if they were completely stoned and taking really radical substances... <br />like cockatoos is cool with the birds on flight opening...a thousand hours is so sweetly orchestrated it brings tears to even a stone...icing sugarm is jazz meets psychedelia meets Robert Smith....ahhhh shiver and shake and fight are fillers but are ok songs
B00008BXJJ|5.0|There was once a time when I did not accept Brian Johnson as the new Ac/Dc frontman. I grew up listening to Bon Scott, the fact that someone replaced him and that people actually liked this man displeased me. I couldn't believe they actually put this man on the same level as Bon. I just heard Back in Black and For Those About to Rock and I still wasn't used to this new vocalist. THen, one day I saw AC/DC Live(the 2 disc) and thought:\\"maybe I should check it out, after all, it is AC/DC.\\" It happened to be one of the greatest decisions I ever made. After hearing Johnson sing all of those Bon classics, I could tell he meant it from the very depth of his soul, unlike some frontmen (Sammy Hagar singing Dave songs, for example). I am proud to say that this man is the perfect man to replace the late Bon Scott and that if anybody else says different I will fight them for it. I definitely recommend this to anyone with even the slightest hint of interest in this album. I still say that AC/DC's first live album, If you Want Blood, is still better, but this one is right up there.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|This is a really eye-opening film. Instead of women being mere cheerleaders from the sidelines, the teacher challenges their education and encourages them to apply it. Back then women went to school to become better conversation partners for their husbands (and to be a better hostess for her husbands' friends), impress their families, etc...but still stayed at home and was still judged on her ability to keep it clean, have children and be faithful and a good parent (even if the husband was not). In the social (pecking) order or hierarchy, femininity still meant playing the doll, and marriage was a trap for reasons other than true love. Essentially women can do almost anything a man can, even be in business, leaders and soldiers. Arguments about representing only the majority leads to being artificially handicapped (disabled and disarmed). There are inner natural abilities and the outer, aesthetic stereotypical/traditional gender roles a society or culture imposes upon oneself. Which do you choose?
B000AA305M|4.0|Any time you want to listen to an album all over again when you get to the end is good thing. This is one of those. If you like his others, save lost songs which is great but slower, you will not be disappointed. Unravels slow and sweet like candy.
B000002HAJ|5.0|wowwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!so nows the chance to revieew this contemporary music jewel....well..where to start... <br />lets start from OPEN....what a great intro....bass and guitars start jamming in what i can call the most extraordinary tale about social inconformity...or hipocrisy or whatever....the lyrics are despiteful of being locked around with stupid people ...wow.....high is like flying in the sky...Robert really reveals how childlike and dreamy he can be,,,i like from the edge of the deep green sea...how much pain can someone stand and the guitars verses chord evolution is simply epic...trust is a beautiful piano driven melody of someone tring to hold on to someone...cut is rock angst on cool guitars and desperate yells...to wish impossible things is soft and end is simply that ... an end
0446608955|5.0|<br />In this book so much attention is paid to the details of Jamie and Landon's relationship unlike in the movie. I especially like the christmas at the orphanage part it shows so much more depth than any part of the movie. The book covers religion, love, school, parents, embarassment, charity, and its very intertaining. I have read this book at least 70 times before, and It makes me cry every single time. <br /> <br />I reccommend this book to anyone who loves a good love story.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Is it possible to put into words how amazing this Musical was? It's almost impossible! What can be said other than \\"it was pure and utter magic!\\" As a 14 year old who had attempted to read the book- at first I was not too sure what to expect when seeing this show with a friend and our mothers in NYC. I especially did not expect to be completely blown away by the complete ingenious quality that Wicked delivers- even to us teens, who have such a hard time finding a Broadway play that's perfectly suited for us.<br /><br />The vocals are gravity defying- literally! When seeing the show live with Megan Hilty and Shoshana Bean, I got absolute chills during Defying Gravity and No Good Deed; I laughed my heart out during What Is This Feeling and Popular! My heart leapt and dove during As Long as Your Mine and Not That Girl; and not to mention the tear jerking drive of the ending duet, For Good.<br /><br />This CD brings to life every bit of feeling and wonder that there was onstage- and the originating vocals and roles of Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel seem to take you right back to the stage; even if they weren't \\"your Glinda and Elphie\\".<br /><br />What I love most about the whole play in general is how a young adult such as myself can enjoy it with every ounce of feeling as an adult can! The music is something peers will still catch me humming to in the hallways, and countless friends have been confused yet intrigued by my descriptions of the wonderfully intricate plot line.<br /><br />Is it possible for one play and its wonderful music that can be listened to with the same immensity every time to make such an impact on all ages? Of course! And Wicked does just that!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Alright, let's forget about their mistake they made after this cd, the one they called 'City of Evil'. Forget every bad feeling you have of this band... and let me tell you about this CD. Waking the Fallen is THE perfect cd, one of my personal favorite metal CDs... it was well put together, the vocals were balanced so perfect, so that they were neither overdoing it or not not trying hard enough... it was the perfect balance of music... the guitars were great, the drums... perfect. I have no complaints about this one. GO BUY IT NOW!
B00005JM02|5.0|I love this movie how a son gets lost and a father goes looking for him. A sad part was in the beginning of the movie when the mom died and almost all the babies.I love how dory is, she funny especial because she has shotr term memory and she knows how to read so she aint that dumb.
0316168815|2.0|I'm not sure what this book was intended to accomplish.  I thought it was unique and enjoyed a lot of it, but I was ready for the story to be over long before the end.  For me it became a shallow observation spanning 8 years of the lives of Susie's family and friends from her view point in heaven.   <br /> <br />I thought there were a couple of opportunities that were missed, action and philosophical depth.  I don't require action in a story.  Some good old fashion haunting may have helped or may have hurt the story, but Susie's unexplained and uncontrolled appearances didn't do anything for it.  And for depth, I don't expect a treatise on death a la Peirs Anthony's `On a Pale Horse' but some philosophical exploration would have been nice.   <br /> <br />There are some great books that are simple observations of average individuals, `Plainsong' by Kent Haruf, `I Know This Much is True' by Wally Lamb, `The Heart is a Lonely Hunter' by Carson McCullers.  If the intent of this book was to take a poetic journey through the lives of the Salmon family, then the writing just didn't compel me in that direction.  `The Lovely Bones' had potential but, for me, it missed the bull's eye if there was even a target.
B000065U1N|5.0|this movie is the greatest movie ever.  I tells of how these brave souls escape a dangerous town.  This movie is packed with action. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE............
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Horrible Keanu Reeves action/horror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that takes all the good this film had and destroys it with his sheer lack of talent. I feel sorry for his fellow actors which includes Rachel Weisz, (who give the movie's only real performance) for even being on the same screen with him because despite their good work, he manages to make the movie into a real choir to watch and that's in itself a crime because a better actor would have done more with the role.  <br /> <br />The bad word of mouth is justified.  <br />

B00005JNTX|4.0|First of all, this Robert Rodriguez film of Frank Miller's graphic comic books is mostly in B&W, not color as advertised.  This is ideal for the material, but may have accounted for deserted theaters the second week of its release.  It is a brutally violent film noir, co-directed and co-written by Miller and Rodriguez; Rodriguez, who also cut and photographed this baby, wanted a flawless translation of Miller's inky B&W comic book novels.  So, we have a movie that is 90% B&W and incredibly violent.  Let's get that out of the way up front. <br /> <br />Basin City at night becomes a nightmare film noir city of awful violence and evil characters, in B&W with dabs of color now and then--a red dress and red bedspread, a woman with gold hair, a zombie with bald gold head, a blue car--in an otherwise B&W landscape.  The art direction and visual effects are stunning and make SIN CITY worth recommending. <br /> <br />Rodriguez and Miller basically have three stories to tell that all take place in Basin City at night--(1) Bruce Willis as a retired cop with a bad heart who wants to save exotic dancer Jessica Alba; (2) a heavily made-up Mickey Rourke as a prizefighter out to avenge the death of his beloved girlfriend; and (3) Clive Owen in a very complex tale of Old Town prostitutes and a guy who wants to save one of them from psychopath Benicio Del Toro. <br /> <br />You will probably either love or hate SIN CITY, and know which after only five minutes of screen time.  It is exceedingly brutal and nasty, but also has towering production design, stunning visual effects, and unusual characters.  It is the kind of movie that Leonard Maltin can hate, while Ebert & Roeper can give \\"Two Thumbs Way Up\\" to.  When it opened, the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE's Mick La Salle gave it ****.  If you like the Frank Miller comic books, you will probably find it a masterpiece.  On a too short behind-the-scenes documentary on the DVD, Miller says he is floored by how faithful Rodriguez is to the source.  That is why Rodriguez brought him on board as co-director, which cost Rodriguez his membership in the Directors Guild.  Things must have deteriorated inside the DGA since Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly co-directed ON THE TOWN (1949) and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952).  (Reviewed from widescreen DVD, and rated \\"R\\" for sexual material and brutal violence.  It is for adults only.) <br />
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Jimi hendrix is by far one of THE BEST guitarists in the history of Rock.  His obvious tallent is definitely captured on this great cd!  so, weather you are a huge fan, or have never heard jimi play, you have to get this cd!!!!!
B00006BTCA|4.0|I must admit that I wasn't a fan of Interpol in '02. When \\"Antics\\" came out, I took a chance and was plesantly surprised. The album grew on me to where I was wanting more. I purchased \\"Turn On The Bright Lights\\" and was more than satisfied. Out of the two albums, this one seems more like a downer and it is and there's nothing wrong with it. Paul Banks' voice also sounds slightly different. It's more desperate sounding, nervous, and worried. I enjoyed that kind of emotion on this 11 track gem. The only song that confuses me is \\"Say Hello to Angels\\". It's not a bad song but it sounds like something the The Strokes would play (and believe me, that ain't bad either). Still, I couldn't help but wonder, if The Strokes had played \\"Say Hello to Angels\\", wouldn't it have been better? Still, despite \\"Obstacle 1&2\\", songs like \\"Untitled, Stella Was A Diver and She Was Always Down, NYC, and The New are pitch black perfect. And if you ever get the chance to see this band live, do please. They are excellent and so is \\"Turn On The Bright Lights\\".
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Double Agent and Leave That Thing Alone are my favorite songs on this cd.    peart is a master on the drums!!!  He should be frozen for about 40 or 50 years so everyone can enjoy his drumming.   Dont get me wrong, i loooove rush, but some of the songs on here are not that great.  still a 5 star cd   <br />   <br />
1400034779|4.0|This is a book that just grabs you by the heartstrings and refuses to let go.  The wonderful heroine, Precious Ramotswe, decides to set up the first ever detective agency in Botswana, the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency, and sets about solving the various misdemeanours and marital disputes brought to her by her clients.  This was my reading group's choice, and what we all said we admired most was the combination of razor sharp insight, and gentleness that Precious Ramotswe shows.  Some Amazon reviewers have, I see, compared her to Miss Marple, but to me she's more like a female version of Hercule Poirot.  What adds considerable poignancy to her character is the fact that we learn that she has a deal of heartbreak in her background, in that she has endured a brief, but abusive marriage, some  years before.  The present day love interest in the form of her delightful, and ever patient suitor, adds narrative tension - will she or won't she succumb?  I am giving the book four stars, rather than five, because I feel that the portrait of Botswana is somewhat idealised - although, to be fair to McCall Smith he does include the darker subjects of witchcraft and child abduction amongst the more innocent story lines.  But overall, a delightful read, which has made me want to go on to the other books in the series.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|I like this CD alot but don't think its as big as all the hype.
0316168815|4.0|The opening chapters of this book are so harrowing as to be almost impossible to read at times - what Sebold has shown us through her marvelous descriptive powers is a glimpse of hell as the teenage girl, now in heaven, recalls in unflinching detail the terrible fate that she suffered at the hands of her neighbour, Mr Harvey. The premise for this novel is fascinating - that the murdered girl views the world she so cruelly lost, from the perspective of heaven.  This gives the story line an almost unbearable poignancy as we see her family gradually implode under the burden of their grief - and the way her mother declines is especially traumatic.  But Susie's intermittet haunting is not always satisfactorily portrayed - and is often confusing - and this tends to detract from the novel's power.  I also wished to see more anger from her at what has been done to her - but she seems emotionally unengaged - presumably because in heaven - wherever that may be - there is no such thing as rage or bitterness.  Neverthless The Lovely Bones is a very memorable and thought provoking read.

B0001Z52RU|2.0|If you are a sane Christian or Jew, and sick an tired of<br /><br />weird sicko movies --stay far away from this movie. There is no<br /><br />excitement; just sorrow for the Director and Play nwriters.<br /><br />The lead actor's childhood sweetheart has blue eyes. As a teenager she has brown eyes, and in her late teens, blue again.  She dies and then doesn't die.  This is the least of the problems with this film.  Their is a big fat guy named thumper who masterbates in his bed clothes, a poor dog set on fire, and many more disgusting things. This is a movie that no sane individual should pay to see.
B000007U6V|5.0|One thing that I haven't seen any other reviewers talk about is that one of the things that makes this album (and all the early Kraftwerk albums) so remarkable is that it was all composed entirely without the modern recording technology that artists have taken for granted since the early 80's.  The main technology Kraftwerk did not have in their early albums was MIDI.   <br /> <br />For those of you who are not musicians, you may not know what MIDI is.  MIDI allows synthesizers to be played into a MIDI recorder (a.k.a. a sequencer).  The sequencer then plays back all the parts electronically.  Think of a sequencer as the paper used in an old player piano.  When you click play on the sequencer it plays back all the sequenced parts in perfect tempo.  All the great electronica, from pioneers New Order to all of todays electronic and techno artists use MIDI.  In the early days of MIDI, New Order used midi mainly to play back repetitive notes such as basslines and drums. <br /> <br />MIDI did not exist until the early 80's, a decade after Kraftwerk started recording music.  Kraftwerk had to play every single instrument live and in 1 take.  That makes listening to their music that more impressive when you hear a 22 minute \\"live\\" masterpiece such as \\"Autobahn.\\" <br /> <br />Anyone can mimic this music with today's modern technology, but these guys were doing it 30+ years ago with nothing more than some analogue synthesizers and a multitrack tape recorder.  Impressive
0060794410|3.0|The material in the book seems good; Collins has managed to extract some fascinating conclusions from his data, though as other reviwers have pointed out, the companies profiled have not continued their success post the end of Collins' study. <br /> <br />What made the audiobook only worthy of three stars was the amazingly anoying delivery by Mr. Collins.  Every! word! is a reason! for an exclamation! point!  Man - go take your ritalin, or lay off the speed...   <br /> <br />I may pick up Collins' next work, but I'll make sure it is the book, and not the CD.
B000AL730O|5.0|The talented Paul plays nearly every instument on the record. This record sounds more like McCartney since, well the Beatles. Since his first solo album \\"McCartney\\",in 1970 Paul writes songs are light, brezzey and likable. This is to date the most interesting, ambitious and revealing recording we gotten from Paul to date.  From the start the first track \\"Fine Line\\", begins with a driving piano and upbeat tempo that builds reminds one Lady Madonna.  \\"Jenny Wren\\", could be a companion to Blackbird. \\"English Tea\\", sounds like it could have come of \\"Revolver\\". A thoughful more pensive McCartney evokes throughout. Producer Nigel Goodrich took Paul out of his Element by telling him to leave his band at home. Goodrich credits include Radiohead, Beck & Travis.  He pushed Paul by being brutally honest on what he liked or didn't like.  The first person do so since John Lennon. In the recording studio It's easy for someone to say, yeah that sounds great Paul even when it isn't, after all it's Paul McCartney. The results the most rounded piece and assured work we have had from Paul in years. At 63 years of age it looks like Paul won't be doing the garden and digging the weeds, when he's 64.     <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A well made show that the small screen did not have the faith to run with.  The show is well put together and you can not help but like and understand all the crew.  Joss Whedon used great insight and thought to make a show with a crew that anyone old or young would like.  Firefly has it all-from drama to comedy to romance.

B00004YX39|5.0|From the day i heard \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" in high school way back when, I was hooked. This recording was LIGHT YEARS ahead of its time! It ranks up there to this day as one of the best recorded and best produced albums EVER! You would be hard pressed to find a better bunch of musicians than those that appear on this recording, which is hard to do because their previous recording \\"AJA\\" may be right next to it in those qualities also. This is music that is as fresh and vibrant today as it was 25 years ago. It simply doesnt get any better than this!
B000053V7Q|5.0|Being English, we did not get an opportunity to see Elvis live in concert - we had the films, and we had the records (before c/d's!), but of course he never came to England, and therefore, never had the chance to see him perform. <br />Recently, the tv have shown the video to Suspicious Minds, and I must say I was impressed. I had to send to America for the DVD (couldn't get it in England), and when it arrived I was really in awe, what a wonderful performer, and this dvd put together from a series of concerts over 3 nights, was wonderful.  I can now understand why he is called the king, and deservedly so. I am so glad I took the trouble to track down this dvd.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I wrote a review for the cd awhile back and gave it a one star. Why? I believed the hype that Green Day sold out. Boulevard of Broken Dreams was over played on raido and tv and even made a spot on Kids Bop. I was immature and wrote a review that I now regret. I'm hear to make the right call about this cd. Green Day was my first love for a band and though i'd move on to other bands, they still hold a place for me. Now that im mature and wiser, I find myself growing up with the band. The music feels like a friend who has grown up with you. Wake Me Up When September Ends describes me almost perfectly and probably the best Green Day ballad out they've ever written; Jesus of Suburbia is probably one of my faviorte songs that exceeds the eight minute mark. When I started listening to Green Day, I was young and immature. Ive grown up and this cd seems to be a reminder of a friend I had that I lost contact with. An amazing piece of music. Thank you Green Day for always being there for me. I hope to see you guys on tour before I depart from this world.
B0000AZKPC|5.0|\\"Ecliptica\\" was Finnish power metal band,Sonata Arctica's, debut album, and to this day, after three more remarkable albums, I feel this is still their best. It was also the realisation that power metal dosnt have to deal with dragons and wizards, and can still rock, and still have a sort of mystical edge. Tony Kakko's vocals are excellent, Janni's guitar work, and I think he's pretty young, is astounding. The keys, which i also think were Kakko's part on this album, are also great, which are really showcased in songs like \\"Kingdom for a Heart\\". While Tommy, the drummer, does keep a quick beat, that's really all he does. There are very minimal rolls, and the beat kind of remains the same throughout most of the fast songs. But This is SPEED power metal, like Rhapsody, so that's okay. If it aint broke dont fix it, right? All the song's are very catchy (especially \\"My Land\\", which remains my favorite Sonata Arctica song, even throughout all the albums). Even the ballads, like the song \\"Replica\\", are good too. So, if you want power metal without the cheese, Sonata Arctica is the band you've been waiting for! These Finn's are on a rampage! no one can stop them! And god forbid if anyone trys! Go Finnland! Go Sonata Arctica!
B000059T00|5.0|The short lived band known as Blind Faith crafted the best minds of classic and psychadelic rock. Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Ginger Baker, and Rick Grech blow everyone away in this very moving musical journey, in which every band member wrote a song. <br /> <br />First is \\"Had to Cry Today,\\" a normal-paced opener that is excellent. Winwood shows how his vocals have enhanced since his days of Traffic. There is also Eric Clapton's international hit \\"Presence of the Lord,\\" which may be one of the most moving pieces of music I have ever heard. Winwood's vocals, Clapton's guitar and lyrics, and the powerful organ make this an instant classic. Also, Winwood's own \\"Sea of Joy\\" is slow but cheerful, a sign of things to come from the Traffic veteran. <br /> <br />Although the group only survived to make one album, it is one that needs to be purchased from any rock buff, and any fan of Baker, Clapton, or Winwood. This debut and farewell CD is unbelievable, and makes one wonder what else this group could have made.

B000002JSZ|4.0|Originally released in August of 1983, \\"Flick of the Switch\\" is a damn fine AC/DC record, and if you love the band, I really can't understand not digging it.    In the liner notes for the 2003 remastered version of \\"Flick...\\", Malcolm Young explains that the band wanted to get back-to-basics with this record, which they produced themselves, and you can see what he means--the album has a real live-in-the-studio sound to it, with guitars exploding out of the speakers, plus all but two of the tracks are under 4 minutes, and they've completely ditched the special effects a la the bell tolls on \\"Hells Bells\\" or the cannons on \\"For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)\\".  Also, Brian Johnson's vocals are at their gloriously piercing best throughout.    The liner notes in the 2003 reissue also state that the album is \\"remarkably varied\\". Is this a joke or what? One thing that there sure as hell isn't a lot of on this album is variety. The boys do a nice job of mixing up the tempos--you have your slower paced tunes (\\"Rising Power\\", \\"Nervous Shakedown\\", \\"Deep In The Hole\\"), medium-fast tunes (title track, \\"Guns For Hire\\", \\"Bedlam In Belgium\\"), and fast tunes (\\"Landslide\\", \\"Brain Shake\\")--but that hardly makes for a \\"remarkably varied\\" batch of songs. One thing I won't argue about though is that the album is indeed very consistent.    The album starts off with \\"Rising Power\\" which is one of those great AC/DC stompers, with a brilliant sequence of kickass riffs.  Likewise, \\"Nervous Shakedown\\" has another great sequence of riffs and builds spellbinding tension before breaking into the call-and-response chorus. The title track, with its sly guitar licks, is a ton of fun. The boogying \\"Landslide\\" is one of the most wildly exciting rock songs ever--it's a furious, fast-paced thrill ride with an ultra-catchy rapid-fire vocal hook leading into the chorus, and blistering guitar soloing from Angus; if this song doesn't get your heart racing, I don't know what the hell will. Also irresistible are \\"Deep In The Hole\\", with its cry-of-desperation chorus; and \\"Bedlam In Belgium\\", with its clever almost-but-not-quite-synchronized rhythm guitar parts and its spiritedly malevolent chorus.    As solid as the album is, it's not a bonafide classic. \\"This House Is On Fire\\" is a middling rewrite of \\"Hells Bells\\". \\"Guns For Hire\\" sounds a bit rushed-through and underwritten, although there's no denying that it's got a hell of a main riff. The bluesy \\"Badlands\\" lazily recycles the \\"Bad Boy Boogie\\" riff, although there is an ear-catching bit in the riff just before the guitar solo. The album closing \\"Brain Shake\\" is a really cool tune that seems to borrow some of its riffery straight from the Beatles \\"Helter Skelter\\", but the repetitive \\"joy to ride\\" 'hook' gets to be a little annoying, as does the heavy repetition of the title.    You've got to be nuts to think that this album marks the beginning of a major artistic decline for AC/DC.  If you actually enjoy the watered-down, Foreigner-style arena-rock of songs like \\"Touch Too Much\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", then it makes sense that you'd find this album disappointing.  But the true AC/DC aren't about lame cockrock; they're about ass-kicking hard rock, and \\"Flick of the Switch\\" does a very fine job of capturing the true essence of the band--this album is a must for any true AC/DC fan.

I am glad that I bought the illustrated version because it makes the reading experience all the more enjoyable and interesting, providing visual references of the many works of art discussed.<br /><br />It is sometimes difficult to separate fact from fiction though I'm sure many of the details, presented as fact, are fiction. Some of the characters seemed flat and one-dimensional, and the writing can be a bit melodramatic, at times. The pages seem to fly by, especially since there is a cliff hanger at the end of practically every chapter (which can get annoying midway through).<br /><br />This isn't wonderful literature. It is entertaining and fun at best, and bland and poorly written at its worst. Despite that, I found myself enjoying the book which pulled me in from the very beginning. I found myself trying to decipher the codes right along with the two main characters, as well as immersing myself in the controversial 'facts' and really thinking about faith and religion. I think that is the main reason why many people are so drawn to this book.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I actually had a copy of the CD before seeing the play which made it easier to understand the plot line.  When I returned from NYC, I ordered 4 copies for my niece and sisters who went with me to see Wicked.  Amazon had the recording for a great price and I received the order very quickly.  Thanks and have a great listen.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko is indeed one amazing film. It's unclassifiable as a genre but it still manages to confuse you, make you laugh and think. It's not an easy movie to fully comprehend from one viewing alone -that's why i bought the director's cut. The film's audio and image are top-notch quality, and i like the little changes that have been made on both by director Richard Kelly. The second DVD (Extras) is completely unnecessary in my opinion as it doesn't add anything to the movie or help you understand the plot any better. The commentary by Richard Kelly and Kevin Smith (Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma etc.) is informative and entertaining -I just wish Kevin would talk less, it kind of feels like he's always on the edge trying to give his input. Nevertheless it is a reccommended buying, go for this if you buy it first time, for those who own the original 2001 DVD edition it's still worth buying for the aforementioned audio/video improvements.
192076920X|4.0|This was my summer holiday 03/04 read and I really quite enjoyed it. Whats not to like - love, crime, international intrigue, music, drugs etc..etc... my only criticism is that this guy seems to have had the worlds MOST interesting life and the cynic in me thinks surely he embellished some of this (just a little?)I went to an author event at my local bookstore and met the man himself not long after reading the novel as I was dying to see what he was really like. I guess he was what you would expect - a fit aging hippy who was definately 'out there', but warm and seemingly sincere.Quite a character. I've heard this is being made into a movie with Johnny Depp - please God let this be true !

0316172324|1.0|He promotes his book as a new contribution to the way we see and think, and that you would chance the way you see the world. He called it blink or thin-slice. However, he just rediscover the wheel because thin-slice is pretty much a synonimous of \\"clinic eye\\" and this concept is very old. For instance, I heard about clinic eye about 15 years ago, and I know that it was not something new at that time. Clinic eye is like when you mechanic tells you what is wrong with you car in a few seconds by just looking its smock. Clinic eye is when a police think somebody is suspicious by just looking on his behavior and look in a few seconds. Clinic eye is when you mother tell you that somebody would not be a good fried in a few seconds by just looking at him. Pretty much this book is about \\"clinic eye\\", but he called it \\"thin slice\\". The book would not teach you how to improve this skill or how to developed this skill, but it will give you a bunch of examples of clinic eye that pretty much you wont need. IT IS OFFICIAL, THIS BOOK WAS ABSOLUTELY A WASTE OF MY TIME. PLEASE DONT READ IT!!.

B00009V7P8|3.0|I'll say some positive things first: Rice has an emotive, soulful voice, can pen a good lyric or two, and is a talented musician. That said, these same things work against him, at least for me. His voice, while distinct, becomes grating at times -- the way he'll say a line softly at first and then sing it at a higher pitch rather dramatically. It's a nice touch that gets a bit overplayed, especially in The Blower's Daughter. Lyrically, I feel the album has a propensity to teeter off into the land of \\"tales for heartbroken teenagers.\\"  But I think that's what it means to do so that's OK. Heavy-handed and dramatic lyrics like \\"Stones taught me to fly/Love taught me to lie/Life taught me to die\\" seem to target teens flopping on the sands of a crush or heartache but, in the end, they lack real punch.  <br /> <br />Musically, there are many things I like, as much as things I don't. I dig the disjointed piano on \\"Cheers Darlin'\\" and how it builds and breaks into singing strings at the end of the song. I also was impressed with the more agressive jams on \\"I Remember\\" and the extra songs on \\"Eskimo\\". At the same time, the strings / acoustic guitar combination don't do much for me on songs like \\"Older Chests\\" and \\"Cold Water\\" excpet maybe make me sleepy. <br /> <br />I've heard plenty of talk about how Rice is the new voice of modern folk music, how he's a saving grace in the music industry, etc. These are lofty claims that not many can live up to -- and I'd like to see where Mr. Rice's songs are being played in 5 years. Most likely on a soft-rock station over the speakers at a dentist's office. \\"The Blower's Daughter\\", in the end, might be the tune I'm listening to as I get my first root canal.
B0006DTZPC|5.0|This is a great cd for those jazz lovers out there. It has a clean and modern sound, unlike other swing jazz records from long ago. If you like Sinatra's style, you'll like this. <br />Michael Buble sings really well and the songs are well done and catchy. This version includes a Christmas CD, which is a must! Click on buy!
B000002MTU|5.0|In looking at some other Clapton reviews, I realized that this album is over 10 years old and I still love it.  L-O-V-E it.  There are plenty of reviews here that will take you through the album in chapter and verse, talk about the blues, Eric's career, I just want to say - get this album.  Just get it, it will blow you away.  Put it in your car's CD player and go for a drive.  The musicianship here is raw, simple, correct.  You will let it play over and over and still be knocked out each time.

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|<br /> <br />I didn't bother to see the film when it came out, but I spent an afternoon watching the DVD and enjoyed it for what it is. It was not called, \\"The Illiad\\", it did not purport to be. It was meant as an entertainment based upon the work of Homer and Quintus Of Smyrna. As that, I found nothing at all wrong with it. <br /> <br />The producers have chosen to edit the gods out of it and to concentrate upon battle scenes and sexual relationships, a pragmatic decision made for obvious reasons and the result is a more contemporary popular amusement with a most un classical attitude toward love and marriage which is more in accord with contemporary mores. I understand the reasons for this; the work is not meant as history, but rather as present day entertainment. <br /> <br />For historians, there are distinct benefits. If nothing else, the sheer magnitude of the visuals is elucidating. Reading the numbers is not the same as seeing the entire horizon dotted with Greek ships. This visual aid helps in understanding the numbers. The scope of the battle scenes reveals the numbers better far than any written record could. <br /> <br />Details may be anachronistic within their context, but are still useful to a historian's understanding. When the Myrmidons form the classic Roman tortuga with their shields, they anticipate a military maneuver by a thousand years, yet who is to say that this never occurred before the Roman's adopted it? I for one, am happy to see just how this works. I reiterate, this is not intended as accurate history, but rather as entertainment. Watching the advancing tortuga was very entertaining to me even if it seemed somehow out of place at Troy. <br /> <br />The film presents some perspectives which are interesting and contribute to some long standing arguments. Debates about the relationship of Achilles and Petroclus have raged for centuries and are not always strictly rational. Later writers aver that the relationship was a homosexual one. This is never stated in Homer's work and those who wish to hold to this view dismiss that simply by saying that it was to be, \\"understood\\". It seems to me to be of little more than prurient interest. It is of primary importance to the plot that Achilles loved Petroclus; how he loved him is not. The producers of, \\"Troy\\", show Petroclus as an orphaned cousin of Achilles who is younger and less experienced. Achilles has taken the young man under his protection and assumed the father role in this relationship. The young man is vulnerable and endearing and any sort of father would love him very deeply. Unless one has some sort of ax to grind, I see no reason to argue with this perspective and no evidence to argue contra. The point may have some relevance to homosexual activists, but it has little importance to this story and the producers have I think, done well to eschew the sensationalism rather than exploit it. <br /> <br />I cannot however, agree with the view of heterosexual monogamous love presented in this film. It is, I think anti historical. For a man to excessively love any woman , wife or mistress, was at the time considered an effeminacy unbecoming a man and a point of ridicule. When rallying the Trojan soldiers, Hector exhorts them to love battle, love their country and love their woman, it presents a view of heterosexual love never dreamt of before the 12th century. <br /> <br />I have never been convinced that Paris greatly loved Helen nor that the abduction of her as a possession, was the real cause of the Trojan war. This film very pragmatically I think, takes the view that there was much more to it than that. It is the view of the authors that the entire thing comes down to Agamemnon's lust for power and influence and this idea is not easily discarded. <br /> <br />Agamemnon here, and in Homer is the heavy. The whole Briseis affair is unnecessary as Achilles hates Agamemnon from the start. The fight over the possession of Briseis only turns the already existing hatred to the rage which is at the center of the plot. As the character of Achilles is presented, any king over him would be in trouble from the start and as Agamemnon is understood, any disobedience to his authority would be intolerable. Herein lies the whole story. It has been set up from the beginning and awaits only the unfolding of the inevitable. The writers of \\"Troy\\" understood this well; it is the engine which drives the entire tale. <br /> <br />I watch these epics about the ancient world for the visuals. I don't expect to find the same accuracy I would demand in an academic history and sometimes as in this case, I am rewarded with an interesting viewpoint of the subject. If you take it for what it is it can be enjoyable.

0449227421|4.0|Ken Follett's The Third Twin . Is it your upbringing or your genes that decide if you become a criminal or a law-abiding citizen? This was the study that Jeannie Ferrami was conducting and for this she uses identical twins grown apart, one a criminal and other a law-abiding citizen. Sounds difficult to find. But Jeannie designed a program to find them, that analyzes parameters like dental records, brain waves, fingerprints.Now all the trouble for Jeannie starts when she finds Steve Logan, a would-be lawyer and Dennis Pinker, a criminal. On the other side of town, Berrigton Jones and his friends are getting ready to make a 180 Million Dollars from the takeover of their Research/Hospital Genetico, a secret and closed down Military Operation. And they have a very big secret to hide and Jeannie is just about to reveal it. So Berrigton and his friends need to stop Jeannie, which means Jeannie's program suddenly becomes unethical, her research program is cancelled, she is fired, molested.... How she gets through each of these and finally finds the secret Genetico was desperately trying to hide ... all in the span of a week. It is a fast paced page turner... a very very interesting read. I loved it... have read it atleast 3 times!!.

B0001WTWCO|5.0|No better critique of the British single-payer health care system has ever been committed to celluloid. Of particular note among the DVD extras is an alternative ending in which Laszlo de Almasy is transfered to a U.S. hospital and cured within days, and an audio commentary produced by the Brookings Institute.
B00005RERU|4.0|Five stars for the film ,three for the transfer. these comments are for the platinum disc corporation edition and thats important to know because while i have not viewed every dvd edition of one eyed jacks, you might be able to guess as i did that they are not all equal. As one reviewer noted, this one is a little soft and slightly dark but the images are clean and the color while slightly muted , takes on a kind of rembrantian hue and darkness; but not so dark as to spoil the color or mood. in some odd way it improves on the theme of the film.But it is not sharp; i dont think you will find that anywhere you look for this gem. If the definition of a classic is a film with at least five memorable scenes in it, you cannot deny ,one eyed jacks, though over long and uneven in parts, is a true american classic, with our finest modern screen actor at the top of his game.
B0002XL35G|5.0|I recently watched Wim Wender's masterpiece Paris, Texas for the first time and like so many other of his films, this film bottles the soul and emotion in such a way as to make it painful. The long takes, mirror shots, and images of the American southwest work to create the feeling of disharmony that seems to impede Travis (Harry Stanton) from being able to understand himself and his role as a father in society. As I watched this I could not believe that Wender's could capture so much of the American spirit of the love of the land, especially wide open spaces, the Western mythos, and the true tragedy of this film and perhaps the nation, the broken home. <br />  I found myself with tears in my eyes at the end as we watch Travis drive away after reuniting his wife and son. For those who love cinema and appreciate it as an art form, this film is a can't miss.
B000002WPI|5.0|This is the best album in hardcore rap history. <br />Pure East-Coast New York flavour from 1993. Rough, rugged and raw hip-hop to the fullest. NUFF SAID.
B00005CDUE|5.0|The Best of Roxy Music easily invokes starry-eyed trances.  I really love this album.  I don't have the same complaints as other fans, as this is my first Roxy purchase, so I'll stick to describing the songs and sounds.<br /><br />This music makes me want to sit on the couch with a glass of wine, close my eyes, and get all silly nostalgic. Great for thinking about love and all that jazz.  Your first highschool dance, that hideous cake of a dress you wore, and the giant pimple on your date's cheek located an inch below his sincere brown eyes.  Ferry's voice is as beautiful and smooth as your date's dancing was awkward, moving from low to high notes without showboating or shrieks.  Reminds me of Chris de Burgh's Lady in Red, which I also love.  It's identifiably eighties and memorable eighties.  Ferry sounds so amazing that the songs are moving--which always seems like such a major, major accomplishment for pop.  And the lyrics aren't half bad either.  Both Avalon and More Than This make me all teary eyed and Love Is the Drug is very catchy.  Actually, all the songs are catchy.<br /><br />I'm not sure I understand the review that says that this band is an acquired taste, I find it really accessible.  Maybe compared to Bach, Coldplay, or Polish deathmetal??  Maybe the album's emphasis on romance is an acquired taste?
0739313126|4.0|I thought this book was spectacular, Dan Brown really did it this time.  Robert Langdon was great in the book Angels & Demons, but was even more of a symboligist hero in the second book.  The Da Vinci Code is definetly full of suspense, action and mystery.  I would highly recommend this book and cn hardly wait for his next book Skeloton Key to come out in stores.
0062502182|2.0|Occasionally in The Alchemist there are moments that made me dog-ear the page, words and turns of phrase that I thought captured an important sentiment about life and the pursuit of dreams. <br /> <br />But these rare moments are embedded in a foggy text, a text that has the appearance of wisdom but is actually quite shallow and vague.  In Santiago's various discussions with the people and things he encounters, from the Englishman to the desert wind, there is a superficial feel of deep ideas being discussed when most of the time there is little substance to the ideas, little development and thought put into them.  Profound words like \\"omen\\" and \\"heart\\" are tossed about without any effortful exploration of their meanings.  These thoughts, these words, are dealt with too easily and superficially. <br /> <br />Rather than stir me and engage me in deep thought, the book actually dulled my mind.  Reading it, I felt as if I were coasting along rather than absorbing anything new or reflecting on things in new ways.  The exception lay in a few moments here and there, which give me pause.  The book has been described as having the feeling of a fable, but good fables are sharper and deeper, and have no need to belabor their points as this tale does.  As to those who likened it to a fairy tale, there are very few things here that you will not see evoked more profoundly, richly and deeply in better books.
0441172717|5.0|I thought Dune was a great book despite the extensive length of the book.  It was very challenging with the figurative language.  The quest of Paul Atreides was very adventurous and mysterious.  Definetly on of the top sci-fi novels around <br />and I look forward to reading the rest of the books in the Dune Chronicles.

B000AL730Y|4.0|For McCartney fans who had been disappointed with how uneven much of his solo work had been from the late-seventies through the early-nineties, it's encouraging to discover that CHAOS AND CREATION IN THE BACKYARD stacks up to the high standards set by his most recent releases beginning with 1997's FLAMING PIE.<br /><br />This latest release is something of a back-to-the-basics recording in that McCartney essentially performs all the instruments himself (a tactic used on his 1970 debut and 1980's McCARTNEY II). The big difference is that he does not produce himself. Instead, he brought on Nigel Godrich who has produced Radiohead and Beck among others.<br /><br />While the album contains its share of ballads, there are no silly love songs here, just simple heartfelt, introspective songs along with upbeat numbers like the opener \\"Fine Line\\" (the video of which is included on the bonus disc along with an animated piece and a documentary).  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000AL730Y|5.0|I am overjoyed to discover the tremendous musical growth exhibited by McCartney on his new album, \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard.\\"  To date, he has demonstrated complex, deep, and evocative musical themes, but these have generally been reserved for non-pop/non-rock works such as Standing Stone and Liverpool Oratorio.  On his new album he has succeeded with inserting this complexity into Pop, which I find refreshing, challenging, and thought provoking. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the honesty of his lyrics and the depth of the message he is presenting here is worthy of someone who has grown within his art during the last 40 plus years.  I would be disappointed if he instead, was still churning out something akin to the Stones' latest, \\"A Bigger Bang,\\" which is neither bigger than their earlier work nor has as much of a bang to it.   <br /> <br />Those still pining for a new \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" will be disappointed.  Those who hope to continue riding the musical wave Paul has taken us on for over 4 decades will be as thrilled as I. <br /> <br />Well done, Sir Paul!
B000002U82|5.0|Urban myths say that Pink Floyd created the Dark Side of the Moon album to be played with the Wizard of Oz.<br /><br />Put the movie on mute and turn the volume `up' on your CD player.  You must start the album on the third lion roar.  Read the intro about the `young at heart' and you're on your way.<br /><br />The music flows with the movie, giving emotional references to the imagery on the screen.  There are some lyrics that loosely fit into the movie.  Such as, `the Lunatic is on the grass' when the scarecrow comes into the story.<br /><br />One of the most powerful moments is when \\"Money\\" starts to play.  There is a pause as Dorothy's awe struck eyes search through her crash landed house.  The camera moves behind her as she reaches for the door handle.  As the door opens, the brilliance of Munchkin Land's splendor, and color, fills the television screen.  And then, \\"chu-ching,\\" the sound of opening cash registers.<br /><br />It's worth at least one try.  If you can figure it out, then you have a new movie to show all your friends.
B00000JBFW|4.0|very good recording from DP with there best line-up. must have for a Deep Purple fan
B00005JM02|5.0|I loved this movie. Anybody from any age can see this movie and still enjoy it. Its about a mother having a lot of fishes and only one survives and they decide to call it nemo. The mother with the rest of the baby eggs get eaten. The father is left with that one fish and as he grows up the father still doesnt want to let go of him. So one day he gets caught by human beings and ends up in a fish tank in a dentist office. So basically he gets taken away from his dad and they start trying to look for nemo. In between this nemo had a friend named dori. But this movie was halroius esepcially the part were they find these sharks that say ' FISH ARE FRIENDS NOT FOOD' and then Nemo's friend (dori) starts bleeding and they start getting chased.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|This is one of the most influential albums in Rock history. Before this album, Rock singers didnt take lyrics seriously, when this album appeared on the racks. It proved that Rock can be poetic. In my opinion, this is the finest album Dylan ever put out. It opens with the epic masterpiece \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" which Dylan himself called \\"The best song I ever wrote\\". The other 8 songs are fantastic. The 11 minute \\"Desolation Row\\" is full of imagery..it's incredible. Dont call youself a Rock N Roll fan if you dont have this album. This album is Rock lyrics at its best.
0529064847|3.0|There is a printing error in this 1990 edition of the NAB.  Deut 10:12 should read, \\"And now, Israel, what does the LORD, your God, ask of you but to fear the LORD, your God, and follow his ways....\\"  It is sad to see that the editors at World Bible Publishing did not catch this.  I have checked other editions of the NAB for the correct printing.
B0000C8AVM|3.0|Dont beleive the hype. this isnt the \\"best\\" Dylan album like many here are calling it. Is it an excellent album? Definitly. Is it his best album? Definitly not. The acoustic sound of the album can get boring, plus there are 2 not very good songs. The album opens with three fantastic songs. \\"Idiot Wind\\" is a good song but loses its replay value quick. Musically, this is one of his poorest albums. Lyrically, yes it's a masterpiece. But, lyrics are not all what makes an album. Recommended but I dont see the hype that this is the best Dylan album. See \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" for that title.
6304712936|5.0|I love this movie so much.  This movie is wonderful, how it brings a man who is not from our time period back to life.  The way the music is described, while it is being heard, is fantastic.  How two composers interact with eachother, when Mozart is dying is indescribable.  How can sombody with that much power, to compose music, like that, be burried the way that he was?  Rent it, Buy it, Watch it, Laugh & Cry
B000060OFT|1.0|This is absoloutely dire.   I've tried several times but can't get past the first 3 scenes.   I'm glad I read the play before watching this or I would have been put off forever.   To say it's a modern adaptation doesn't really describe it - it's more like a pantomime version with Montagues and Capulets not just as rival gangs but as owners of the town, with their respective names in lights on tall buildings.   Its only insight is into the producer's self-aggrandisement.   Yuk!
0966638328|5.0|I ordered this book because of the reviews.  I also ordered it thinking it would work well with desktop publishing and multimedia.  It provides a myriad of options and trios of color with appropriate mood or sentimate.  I love the book.
B000005RFH|5.0|No matter if it's denied Black Sabbath influenced some of the greatest metal bands around Metallica, Venom, and Slayer to name a few.  And by the way, I agree with all you guys Korn, Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, Linkin Park and Slipknot suck and are crappy fake metal.  This album is downright amazing \\"The Wizard\\" is one of my favorite Black Sabbath songs plus other amazing tracks such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Wicked World\\", \\"N.I.B.\\", \\"Behind the Wall of Sleep\\" and pretty much every track.  The only track I have a hard time with is \\"Warning\\" not because it's long but because it's just boring to me.  Pick this one up it's definately needed.   <br />  No doubt this album is a heavy metal masterpiece.
B000AL730O|4.0|McCartney proves that he still has considerable talent. It may have taken a decent producer to cut through the McEgo and cull it from the man, but in the end, Chaos is a fine record. Lyrically, the songs deliver in such a pleasant way. After the spotty lyrics on Driving Rain, this album nails it. I enjoyed much of Rain, but the tracks were either musically interesting or lyrically solid. They hardly ever were both at the same time. This album is a much more complete puzzle for the listener. One may approach a new McCartney album looking for solid pop singles (after all, no one outpops Macca,) and this album will be a challenge for those people. If, like me, you own every solo album from Thrillington to Rushes, you will find this album somewhere between the pleading lyrical honesty of Flowers In The Dirt and the pleasant stripped down sound of McCartney. That is not to say that the album is not fleshed out musically. There are great produced moments in most of the songs. Even at the barest moment of simplicity, there are brilliant touches. Listen to the timpani entrance on Jenny Wren (around 1:15 in the song.) There is a nuanced interplay between the subject of the lyrics and the driving beat that plays to our emotions. While the song is one of the weak points lyrically, either Paul or Nigel knew that the emotional core of the song was that crucial line :  \\"She saw poverty breaking up her home.\\" It was a very smart move to introduce the full-on production at that very point. Maybe a good producer is what McCartney has needed for so long. <br /> <br />The album rolls along in a very accomplished manner. It sounds like a complete project instead of random songs thrown together. All of the production sounds even and crisp throughout. The most distinguished sound on the album has to be McCartney's voice. The depth of emotion and quality of expression (that was only hinted at in From A lover To A Friend) is all over the album. It is as if the years have given Paul more vocal power instead of less. Yes, you can hear the age in the voice. I tend to enjoy hearing the clean aspect taken away from his usual vocals. On the whole, there are great moments, bland moments, high points, low points, just like most albums should have. How boring would an album be if every track had the same 120bpm pop \\"pot-boilers\\"? The best of the tracks are How Kind of You, Jenny Wren, Too Much Rain, and Riding To Vanity Fair. The mid-range material is there as well. It is hard to listen to tracks like Certain Softness or Fine Line and not feel that they are lesser efforts than the rest here. That is a fine thing. Every artist needs \\"work\\" songs like this to flesh out an album. <br /> <br />Will you love this album? That's hard to say. If you are a fan of Macca's solo stuff (and lean more toward Flaming Pie, Flowers In The Dirt, or McCartney,) you will enjoy this. If you own All The Best and that's it, you may not get much from this album. Overall, to this fan, I am happy to have this in the catalog. Every artist has to mature and grow. Every fan has to accept that this growth is inevitable. If one only enjoys the man for what he did in the 1960s, he or she will never be truly satisfied with any of his solo material. If one can accept this growth process, knowing that, deep-down, it is all inherently McCartney, then this album will work for you. <br /> <br />By the way, is the background track to Riding To Vanity Fair a left-over from Beck's album, SeaChange? Heh, just kidding...
B000AL730O|5.0|I've been a fan of The Beatles since I was 8, and I also have been a fan of the former Beatles' solo careers. I have to say that, first of all, I thought that Paul McCartney was on a bit of a downside since his last album wasn't exactly that great. But he proved me wrong!!! This album is amazing!!!! Is by far one of the best of his career. It has this Beatle taste, the taste that McCartney has all over and that apparently does not want to get rid of it. It's simply beautiful. I heard it all for the first time and I already liked like 6 of the songs, then I heard it for a second and third time and I like every single song!!! This is for me, today, the album of the year. Long life to Macca, long life The Fab Four
0790742780|4.0|Falling Down<br /><br />Drama<br /><br />1993<br /><br />Director: Joel Schumacher<br /><br />Review by: Flint McColgan<br /><br />Expertly directed by Joel Schumacher, Falling Down is the fantastic story of a man who has come to the end of his patience for the filthy, dissappointing world around him, and he sets out to fix it.<br /><br />Michael Douglas gives a startingly great performance as Bill Foster, \\"an ordinary man\\" who designs missiles to defend America from \\"the communists.\\"  Foster leads a rather miserable life; his ex-wife, Elizabeth, has a restraining order against him, his daughter is growing up without him experiencing it, he lives with his mother, he has a car with no air conditioning on the hottest day of the year, and he's pissed.<br /><br />The construction sign keeps saying \\"DELAY,\\" \\"DELAY,\\" \\"DELAY,\\" the kids in the school bus next to him are loud, an ugly woman is applying way too much lipstick, a fly is driving him out of his mind, a tacky \\"Garfield\\" stuffed-animal is stuck to the window of a car with children, people are shouting into a cell phone in a convertible, and it's hot, too hot.  Foster just wants to go home.  It's his daughter, Adele's, birthday.<br /><br />Detective Prendergast, played by Robert Duvall, is just trying to finish up his last day on the job before moving to some town with a lake in Arizona with his mentally-ill, manipulative wife when he picks up some on connections in a string of chaotic events.  He has never really been taken seriously as a cop because he is too gentle and just not one of the guys.  Now he struggles to resolve the madness despite gradually becoming a civilian again.<br /><br />Bill has worked hard for his country, got a Purple Heart in Vietnam, works for the defense of the nation and all around him is filth.  America is the land of the free, the home of the brave...  None of these worthless pieces of garbage around him are worthy of it, even of life.<br /><br />The acting is truly amazing... Douglas almost lead me to tears in his confused reaction to his life and world crumbling, (or,rather, \\"falling\\") down around him.  Duvall is bearly recognizable as the as the actor Duvall, but, instead, totally embodies his character to someone you can almost come to know as a friend.  Barbara Hershey, as Elizabeth, balances both her undeniable fear of and love of Bill, who she really just wants to get better and finally be happy.<br /><br />Supporting characters and minor-role characters really shine with their characters and provide enough depth to where you actually end up hating, loving, or feeling sorry for them.  Foster's mother, Lois Smith, gives a very depressing image of a mother who has forgotten how to live and tries to replace this by befriending glass statues.  Frederic Forrest disgusts the audience with his interpretation of a crazy, Nazi-sympathizing Surplus Store owner who tries to ally himself with Foster.<br /><br />Falling Down presents a world, Las Angeles and surrounding areas, filled with struggling immigrant shop keepers, brutish street gangs, dirty scammers and a homeless population to compete with the homeowners.  This rather chaotic, yet familiar, populace is not helping the already dreary lives of the main characters who all present their own webs of sad, lonely histories in this very memorable, compassionate, and highly enertaining film.<br /><br />4 / 5<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />Bill Foster is commonly referred to as \\"D-Fens,\\" because that was what was written on his license plate.  This is wrong, because usually characters are credited as things other than their names because we do not know their real names. An example is \\"Bandaged Street Thug\\" being a credit for a character that was, well, a gang-member that happens to be prominently bandaged in some way.  Another example would be crediting a spokesperson for a company as \\"[Company Name] Spokesperson\\").  An argument to this would be that Bill had changed into \\"D-Fens\\" when he went on his rampage.  I don't believe this, however, because, from the backstory we learn in the film, he has always been an tempermental, dysfunctional man.D-Fens\\" when he went on his rampage.

015626224X|5.0|As I come to the end of this memoir, I am wondering how Mr. O came to be so down and out; soon as I pull up this site, there's an answer.  An experiment in living.  This reads a lot like Miller's \\"Tropic of Cancer\\" and also reminds of Bourdain's \\"Kitchen Confidential\\".   <br /> <br />I've recommened this to fellow restaurant pros and suggest it as mandatory reading for my  dining room service teams as part of their training curriculum.  70 years later Orwell's comments on why the rich (and wanna be rich) need the poor in order that they remain rich... well, these comments are being made around the world as you read this entry. <br /> <br />What would be helpful as a reader's guide is to make monetary equivalents to reflect the costs of goods and services in today's world economy.  I mean, how much is 5 sous?
B00005JM02|4.0|I think that Finding Nemo is a real hilarous movie. I really enjoyed watching that film. It was sad in a way, because Nemo is the only one that survives out his brothers and sisters. He gets lost and the main point of the movie is that his dad looks for him. when he finnaly finds him after going through alot of scary adventures. In the proces he meets new people like Dori and Bruce. They are the ones that help Nemo's dad find him. I think people from all age ranks can watch this movie. It's a family movie and i'm sure anyone will enjoy it.
0596000480|4.0|A great book which has helped me out so many times.  If you live, eat and breath JavaScript then you probably don't need this book anymore.  However I find that I use such a mix of technologies; Lotus Notes, LotusScript, Java, C, C++, HTML, XML etc, that remembering 100% of the syntax just isn't realistic. That's where this book comes into play as it always seemed to contain just the right information to keep me going.
