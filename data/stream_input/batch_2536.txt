1426209584|5.0|Bought this book for my expert bird photographer sister-in-law.  She really loves this book.  Beautiful pictures and story for bird lovers.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Good action. Decent plot. I was surprised by some of the violence for a pg 13 movie. No nudity.  I guess it's ok to have violence and no nudity these days.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter loved the first one but she is especially loves this one. She really can't get enough of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is really fun and I love to play on createive and survivel u should get the app if u haven't already u will build many things
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|great game<br />one ofnthe best apps I have for the kindle sometimes the game freezes. for a secondor 2 but over all just a great game
B001BANK32|5.0|This is another of Stephen King 's best. So creepy, scary, and draws me in as if I'm there. I'll never walk past another hedge without worrying if it's watching me.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A real read; complicated life. Made my heart smile, laugh and hurt. I'm sure there are many that can take away from this book, sad but true.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I absolutely love this album! It's amazing! Warrior, Neon Lights, Nightingale, and Fire Starter are my personal favorites but the whole album is fantastic! So amazing!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's perfect.  I have vision problems and it's so easy to see.  I'm so happy Amazon made it available for the Kindle.
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|It sounded like there was a story or mystery to solve, and there isn't. It is a very boring game.
B003YMNVCA|5.0|I've had all the prior editions in hardcopy. I had to have this edition. This is an invaluable reference that I use as well as recommend to any up and coming Unix/Linux administrators.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Very entertaining film. My wife and I have seen 3 times now and I still laugh as hard the 3rd time as the first!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I never knew this game exsisted till my mom's friend showed me it on her IPad I love this game I can't stop playing it. I would recomen this game if you like the outdoors and building things ,or being creative or serving on your own
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This is a very good app, but it kept giving me a city that I didn't want and when I put in the right one, I couldn't find how to take out the one that was only part of my cities name.
B000MV9026|5.0|Love this movie music, dancing, and penguins all in one movie so much fun. I sing along with my son and dance. I'm so glad I bought this not just for him but for me to.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|What hasn't already been written, said, or discourse given on this great novel.  It is one of those classics that you can read and read over and over again.....and I do.
B002MRROKS|5.0|This show is just awesome, I saw an interview where Kurt said he didn't really like going to see other people play and that he had only been to like a few concerts, but when he was on stage he gave them a show they'd remember. From beginning to end you'll be glad you pressed play.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its not one of those games that you just can't put down but its not too bad of a game.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I love Jeffrey Archer's writing style and I believe I have read everything he has ever written. I very much enjoyed reading this trilogy and could not wait for the next installments - mostly because of the cliff hangers he used to end each installment. Frankly, as I read the first two books I was a little annoyed by where he left the reader at the end of the book but took heart that all would be revealed in the next book.<br /><br />Hopefully, Archer will be writing a fourth book for this series because, once again, he leaves the reader with a huge question mark. Not sure if I will read another Jeffrey Archer book in the future.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a great app with a mindbending twist.  It is kinda slow, but it takes only about 10 seconds or less to load.  If you are worried about slowness, don't be. And the ads are fine, they don't really get in my way. Overall, this is a great app!!!
B003ESKXGG|5.0|Nice watch, i'm using it now for a week and i'm very satisfied with how it looks and feels: solid and of high quality. The hour markers are placed on top of the display and the christal glass has a very slight globe shape which is nice. 2 years warranty and rapid shipping completely overclassed my expectations!
B004W2V254|4.0|I found the beginning of the film rather slow but as it progressed it captured my attention.  The portrayal of the mountain scenes and the rescue attempt was striking
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Good app just wish you could exchange sand dollars for algae and that if you did a task before you get credit for it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|amazing cant stop reading it, gets more interesting as the story develops in every single chapter. it's a great book very well written and with such an imagination
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game for horse lovers. really simple and easy to play.  I wish the horses were cheaper than what they are
B009IJJB8G|5.0|The twists and turns of the first season grip you to want more!!<br />It looks like we have our selves a great new show to watch...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I'm addicted to it I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT<br /><br /> LOVE IT SO SO MUCH ITS THE BEST<br /><br />It's my favorite game
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I'm a little worried about the size and the Internet access but other than that it's a nice clean app, easy to use. .. what else can I say??....<br /><br />To Developer, Thanks for this App,
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was nice to get a Neurosurgeon's perspective of life after death, or near death.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I love the element of suspense and mystery.  This is the book for One Book Odessa this year and they made a great choice.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I find myself staying up laying in bed playing Diamond Dash at night! My kids even evenjoy playing this game.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Short and sweet....the characters in this book in no way resemble the characters we have grown to love and loathe the entire series.  As I was reading, I felt like the book was written by somebody else.  Everything got wrapped up neatly in a nice package, but it is a package I have a hard time accepting because the book just did not ring true.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I admit I saw the TV series and then read the books. I started with \\"As the crow flies\\" (apparently the last book) and then decided to read them in order. In this first book (of 8?) the writing is sometimes a little too heavy but its worth it for gems like this description of fly fishing enthusiasts, \\"They were as bad as drug fiends, living in their shadowy world of aquatic intrigue\\". LOVE that!<br />Really good read. Great descriptions of Wyoming and the Walt character is very sympathetic. I will read them all....
B001AQR3E4|5.0|After about twenty years, The Interview with the Vampire is still my favorite vampire movie of all times. I watch it every few years, and still enjoy every moment of it. I just purchased the Blu-ray, and although the quality is not very much improved over the DVD release, it has sturdier casing. Because of its design, the casing on the DVD release was more prone to scratches, and the tabs that hold the disk inside broke after a year. Fortunately, the Blu-ray release has a standard Blu-ray case. Enjoy! :)
B003CR9BYE|5.0|Frank and Antonio completely complement each other on each and every track. It matters not if you like or love either of them. Put this one on and close your eyes....you'll know what I mean when I say that these two, together have hit what I call musical nirvana! A Classic Masterpiece! A beautiful re-master of it that you can tell was lovingly done to translate that incredible power to CD! A must for any one who loves good, good music! Between Frank's phrasing, voice and nuance, and Antonio's guitar, voice, passion and in most cases, strong songwriting, makes for one major master stroke of musical genius!
0385513755|5.0|Beside the controversies behind every Dan Brown book, the special hard cover version that we received has nice color illustrations and beautiful pictures printed on heavy glossy papers. The illustrations actually enhance the story. It is a beautiful book with an engaging story. What else do I need?
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|As a working mom of small children I could relate to much of Fey's humor and angst. Not sure I got any great insight into life but I did laugh out loud a few times and sometimes it makes you feel better to know you are not the only one struggling.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Well written and attention grabbing. Found it hard to put this book down while waiting for the next turn of events.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|It's been a little less than a year since I watched this movie for the first time (I've watched my 5-6 times since) and it hasn't lost any feeling. While the wooden acting has been beaten to death I will say in their (SEALs) defense that they don't get paid to act.<br /><br />After reading some of the 1 and 2 star reviews I had to make a review. Not many people realize that most, if not all the action scenes used live ammo, grenades, rockets, etc. Yes, they could hit the moving trucks while sitting in the bed of another moving truck (directors were shocked when they did). The extraction via boat also used real ammo and that Bronco was nearly cut in half by the mini-gun (All real. No CGI).  Yes, they were swimming under a storm of lead. Why? Because, they practice how they play.<br /><br />This movie wasn't going to wow any Hollywood critics, but that wasn't the point. The point was to show the capabilities of the SEALs. To be honest, I'd rather watch this movie a million times than watch \\"SEAL Team Six\\" again. Sure STS had better character development (which is to be expected since they had real actors), but the overall feeling was too dramatized. Act of Valor is about as close as anyone is going to get to seeing them in action unless you have the misfortune of being on the receiving end of an assault. That in my opinion is what makes this a great movie and a must own.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I've seen this movie several times and each time enjoy it. Its very well cast and while the plot is a bit of a stretch, the acting more than makes up for it. And the music... Michael Hedges does the guitar work and he's one of my all time favorite musicians. Plus I'm a sucker for a happy ending. :)
0316224588|2.0|Having read all of Ian Rankin's novels, and generally enjoying each, it was with great anticipation that I dove into his latest.  I can only surmise that Ian simply didn't know what to do with the plot to make a Rebus story more intriguing, more --- mystifying, more something. The whole story was simply boring.  No twists, no irony, no anything.  What a wasted slog.  I was relieved to be done with it.  This was a very poor effort.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I like that Jodi approaches this subject from all angles.  There are no winners, just survivors.  It's easy to point a finger and assume there is a clear cut villian when we see a story like this play out on the news.  Jodi peels back the layers of the lives of the characters and gives us a new prospective to ponder.  Tough subject...excellant book.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this app it's not all about fairies but your person is a fairy it's a lot like dragonvale except you take care of plants not dragons get this app they even have offers
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits is addictive. Best video  rental money I've ever spent. I confess getting the first couple from an &#34;alternate site&#34; then wound up paying for them so my wife would get hooked in HD. Start with the pilot and watch the next three and you will be hooked.<br />There are two seasons already out and USA picked the show up for season three so watch the first two now and set your TiVo in the fall
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I enjoyed books 1-2, but book 3 was somewhat boring to say the least. She could have done w/o writing this one, but like most readers, if you've read the 1st 2 books, you'll read the 3rd out of curiousity
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Well filmed and researched documentary about the food industry in the USA. No shock tactics, very methodically presented. Was interesting that Monsanto even has a special section on the corporate website addressing the film. As an Asia having lived in many countries I was always shocked how seeming screamish Americans were about &#34;strange&#34; foods and sights of whole animals being consumed. Now I know!!! I was shocked the level of disconnect people had to the source and preparation of food. I just hope as globalization takes over the food industry we don't all want to eat things we no longer want to recognize. I think is very important to look the animals we eat in their eyes and see that they have had a healthy and respected life.
B002XXNSF6|4.0|Good chick flick, especially if you like Paris and exploring emotions and feelings. Well done by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy especially.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|its awesome. the girls r almost as pretty as meeeee!!!!! its a rlly fun game. I haven't even tried it yet. lol. don't take it from me.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Bought this app to entertain my toddler. She loves it and the bright colors! Simple and easy to use. I haven't ran into any bugs either, very smooth playing.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|This book was recommended by my favorite music artist and I am extremely glad I picked it up. The Alchemist is an inspiring novel about a young Shepard boy that is fulfilling his personal legend. I really enjoyed reading this novel and it kept me wondering what would happen next. The language was pretty basic however, and the novel was rather short. It felt as if the story was long although there are only about 150 pages. The characters in this novel are interesting and every person that Santiago meets has a meaning in his life. It seemed like every person he met had an impact on his journey. He would meet people that would either keep pushing him towards his legend, or they gave him valuable knowledge that helped him later on. Overall I really enjoyed this novel and I recommend it for people with an open mind. This novel can easily be read in one day and you will not be disappointed if you are looking for inspiration.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Funny, fresh, sweet and heartwarming! Never laughed so much with a book before, definitely looking forward for more to come from Emma!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Excellent game! I was unable to get the Pc version so this is a great alternative for me. But I would like to know how to get to multiplayer, as it will just keep saying searching for game for hours. And small request: please add wolves, it would be nice to have a companion. And also a larger map would be fantastic. Other than that great app.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love the game and now on the kindle but I cant change the skins and that annoys me anyway greater game
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|Take a break from your day with this absorbing game! Little surprises during game play make it even more fun. Operates very smoothly on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This is a very well done card game.great gameplay and and the cards look fantastic.<br />I would recommend to anyone that is a fan of magic the gathering.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I feel this was a add tool for my face-to-face interviews and I accepted the offer.  Also was promoted to the Chief level after two day on the job.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Volbeat is not a one hit wonder. They have a sound like no other. You can listen to the entire album and not want to skip any songs, just like on all of their other albums. Rockabilly, Country and Heavy Metal!!! They are the best band out there. The live shows that they put on are AWESOME!!! This is what music is all about. They are the real deal!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is a good game. It is a good time killer with various challenging levels. So far no problems with the game. It works great on the Kindle Fire.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|http://www.points2shop.com/s/itunes?ref=uin1290874916<br /><br />Great Item. Perfect condition and no problems.<br /><br />Would definetly reccommend you to all.<br /><br />Thanks a Million.<br /><br />Check out my link too.<br /><br />Brian
B007LNJ3YS|5.0|I seriously can't stop listening to this album. I got it late just because I wasn't 100% sure if I wanted it but it's just so good. I really like ambient and chill out-ish music and this is just great. A real easy listen and it is pretty interesting how it's packaged, since it is a double vinyl you would expect it to open but it doesn't instead they made the cover kind of box-y or 3-dementional I guess, to put two vinyl sleeves in instead also the sleeves are like inside of sleeves that have pictures on them it's really nice. Pick this up if you can!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I really like this game and the replay value is quite high.  I like how it teaches is simple to learn but can also be quite complex with the physics behind the scenes.
B00A6L78TY|4.0|Let me first say that I LOVE Foxygen. I saw them in concert once as an opening band and then checked them out and figured they are great. This album is also one of my favorite albums recently! What I don't like about this album is the production. The first time I played it lots of the songs skipped especially Shuggie (which is my favorite song on it) I thought it would maybe fix it self after a while but defiantly not it still skips. It might even be my record player but I don't think it is due to the fact that I play other records all the time that don't skip. It's whatever though, great album all in all. If you want to listen to it before you buy it I would say listen to Shuggie and San Francisco first.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|The visuals are quite good, the puzzles are challenging but not frustratingly so, and it engages the player very effectively.  The story is a tad weak, but I definitely recommend this game.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Playing this game has been a cool but creepy experience! The game play is great and I've spent hours playing this game. If I could, I would give it four and a half stars because it drains battery pretty fast.
1452115567|5.0|What a fun coffee table book!  If you're a dog person you'll love Maddie On Things.  A definite recommendation to have.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|This is the second cord we have bought since buying the kindle fire in November 2012. These cords seem to last about three months.  Not a very good value for money.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|I would recommend this movie.<br />Very entertaining. Especially because I saw it for free as an amazon prime member.<br />The ending should have more substance.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Although not for the squeamish, Walking Dead is completely engrossing! Every episode leads to great discussions about human nature, science, etc. The character development is good, dialogue (usually) believable, and has genuinely scary moments.  As a southerner, my only beef is with the sometimes atrocious accents and general lack of gun shops in supposedly rural Georgian towns! :)
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|An enlightening description of what heaven looks like, what we were before we came into this world, what lies ahead for us in the afterlife and a beautiful explanation of other things unnatural and inexplainable in our human lives today.<br /><br />This is still by far, one of my most favorite books of all time. :)
B00338QENI|5.0|I had no idea about this information that affects our lives to such a degree.  It was also a very human story.
B009CGYO0K|4.0|I instantly took a liking to this because of my adoration for cats. :) A funny comic (and hilarious explanation) of your cat's weird and sometimes peculiar behavior. BEWARE everyone. Haha.
0812982622|5.0|This was a difficult read because of the clear and graphic descriptions of the horrid conditions of citizens living in North Korea. The &#34;hero&#34; was engaging and his early acts of cruelty toward others was a good example of brainwashing in a totalitarian state. I will recommend this book to my book club.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Eccentric, brilliant, simple, easy and unique. A must read for anyone wanting to understand how the autistic mind works. For a teacher like me, handling some kids under this condition, this opened up my eyes on the reality on what's keeping these special people distinct. Brilliant work.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|I received a copy from the author in exchange for an unbiased review.<br /><br />Everville: The First Pillar is set in two worlds - the `Other In Between' and the one we know. College freshman Owen Sage is beginning a normal life at university when he starts to experience strange dreams...and not only when asleep. With friends from this world and allies in EVERVILLE, Owen embarks on a race to save life as either side knows it.<br /><br />Huff begins this first installment by throwing you right into Owen's realization of other worlds. I appreciated the setup of both worlds without making the reader feel insulted by over explanation. A classic struggle between good and evil in different planes, EVERVILLE finds a place on the shelves of young adult fantasy.<br /><br />As you uncover more about each character, you begin to feel part of the team. I appreciate books that can make you join the cause in this manner. I would like to see a bit more character development in the upcoming books, as this first installment mainly serves to set up the plot and setting.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great start to a refreshing new series. I look forward to seeing how Huff picks things up in the second book. Happy reading!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I started the love month with this heart-warming book on hope, survival and on finding true love amidst heart-breaking challenges. I literally cried on this novel. :) A very good read. :)
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very interesting read!!  It really portrays who Steve Jobs really was with both his good and bad traits.  I had a great time reading about what made Steve Jobs tick and where his inspiration came from to build great products.
0060555661|4.0|This was given to me by my boyfriend and by far still one of the best books about stock trading for the long and safe term. :) Another good pick for guides on financial goals.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Entertaining, thoughtful...  enjoyed cast and charaters.... thanks for putting this on my Ipad....and I have 5 more words to use
147674355X|3.0|A YA novel which deals primarily on young love coupled with hardships on family and personal identity and finding your true self through witnessing and resolving your troubled past in connection with the present. I am not so much a fan of cheesy love stories but I respected the unique twist and turnout of events in Sky's past and present. If I were still a teenager, I would have given this 5 stars.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|Oh, brother--was this a disaster!<br />Your movie ticket probably cost more than the nonexistent budget for this truly stupid home movie made by hacks.<br />They must have spent $5.00 instead of $10.00 to put this dreck together.<br />We have a group of silly, moronic people. You can't like any of them. We have one movie set. An ordinary house.<br />Then we have zero scares. Nothing happens. We see too much of the young girl staring into the monitor. Then we have her really repulsive boyfriend hanging around. He does nothing but irritate as he munches and gobbles snacks throughout.<br />The first of this series was mild fun. There were no spectacular scares but it was something different--the minimalist horror film.<br />Now, it's like anybody can go to Wal-Mart, buy a cheap camera and just make a movie in your house. Get your neighbors and families to join in. You don't have to worry about wardrobe. Dress everybody in jeans and tee shirts and tennis shoes.<br />Don't worry about make-up or hair styles. Make it as homey as possible and wow, gee, you've got the premise behind the boring, shallow, stupid Paranormal Activity movies.<br />Please, let this be the end of this dreck.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|Honestly, I got teary-eyed on some parts of the book. It has quite an unfortunate ending but still a pleasant read.<br /><br />A perfect example of \\"what should have been\\" and \\"what you missed out so badly\\".
B00A7W29BE|1.0|It doesn't have all the options that I have in an app that does the sane thing AND doesn't cost aything. Didn't like it.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|Eccentric and truly \\"peculiar\\". I loved how photography was mixed with the story. Eerie photographs were included in the novel. I've read that they're going to make a movie on this one. :) Can't wait to see this on film. :)
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I found this book fascinating.  It is hard to believe how anyone can survive under such conditions.<br />People who read this will have to think about the dangerousness of a government become to big.<br />The fear exhibited was appalling.
B001GA1RFA|2.0|A novel on understanding how the brilliant mind works. Though the novel \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is way much better, this is still a good read. But Among John Green's works, The Fault in our Stars and Looking for Alaska tops the list.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|A typical Nicholas Sparks story, you usually know what to expect, but it is enjoyable nonetheless.  And who doesn't love Josh Duhmael?
B007MB5OCE|3.0|A hilarious and weird novel which tells the story of a centenarian's journey during his youth and the present time with his equally weird friends and adventures.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book kept things interesting the whole time. I'm buying book three now. Kept me glued to my kindle for hours
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I loved the way the pic was shot and as usual he puts his own unique color to a genre. The story is great as well as the acting. Everything about this film drags you in and keeps you there. I am glad that someone is using the tech that is available to filmmaking now a days to create something that I would watch again! I could count the movies on my two hands that make me want to see them again.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|very slow to get going. funny parts really aren't that funny. disappointed in this movie. should have read the reviews.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|This is a fun Pixar and Disney movie.  While not the best Pixar movie, it is still a very good family friendly movie with a great story and message.
B00607EWYC|5.0|But if you love to read you should read this book. Some of the sentences are just like..wow mind blown.
1401207529|5.0|This is a fantastic book and came in amazing condition. I would happily order again knowing that I will be a smooth transaction
B009FZFONO|5.0|amazingly creepy goodness!  what else can one say in regards to simple greatness?  I am out of words!  Thank you!
1401223176|5.0|This is a fantastic book and came in amazing condition. I would happily order again knowing that I will be a smooth transaction
B002WN35DC|4.0|siempre bien recibido es este libro, para grandes y tambien para los mas peque&ntilde;os quienes disfrutan con su frondosa imaginacion
1401235425|5.0|This is a fantastic book and came in amazing condition. I would happily order again knowing that I will be a smooth transaction
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I really like the  the case.  I didn't realize it was a standing case when I orded it.  I couldn't be more pleased.  I also like the color.
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|As a university student who has to give presentations almost once a month, this book helped me a great deal. I implemented the techniques suggested by Akash Karia in almost all of my presentations and found they worked really well with my audience. It was an easy read which allowed me to follow it thoroughly. Other books I've come across bore me enough to put me to sleep before I begin my presentation. This however, shortens and simplifies everything for you. It genuinely teaches you how to prepare a talk, enjoy doing it and make it successful. A definite recommendation.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Intricate enough to be challenging but easy enough to keep you going!  Quite captivating and fun to play.<br />Good luck
B001ANSS5K|4.0|This is another great story given to us from a great author. Green once again gives us strong, believable characters and a dynamic storyline.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|the problem with this game is that it takes up to much space after downloading it it still included an extra 581 MB you have to download
0345525558|5.0|Absolutely one of the most enjoyable books I've read. Perfectly fun... Go indulge. This book will keep you captivated until the end. If you like flowers before reading this novel you will certainly find them to be so much more as you turn to the last page of this novel. The meaning behind each flower makes individual flower species more poignant once the underlying message being conveyed is truly understood. The characters became my friends that I found myself rooting for yet yelling & albeit crying at times. I can't wait until her next novel. I am a fan.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It had a good story. Most books I read have a bad sequel but this was a really good book. I would definitely suggest this to my friends that like kind of a sifi genre.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|....the movie kept buffering/pausing, I've streamed from other services(Hulu, Netflix) in HD and did not have no where near the amount of buffering that I had with this movie, next time I will check other services for any given movie I want to view before ordering from Amazon again.
034554398X|3.0|I'm already bored with this series! Yes, it is true. Even though Martin continues to evolve and twist his plotlines, introducing new developments and information that changes how we look at characters, I find the book overall tiring to read. The writing is richly detailed to the point of excess, with minute descriptions of every setting, person, and activity. Sometimes, this serves a purpose, giving us nuances about a character or creating a realistic scene, but it also at times seems that the author just doesn't like leaving anything to the imagination. He prefers to define even the tiniest detail. The problem is that this can slow the pace of a novel, and I admit that I often skimmed over paragraphs of description that didn't seem important, and questioned why an entire chapter was devoted to something that could have been summed up in fewer pages.<br /><br />This is unfortunate, because some of the storylines in this book were better than in &#34;Clash of Kings.&#34; Dany and Jon Snow's threads were far more interesting this time around. And some of the new developments concerning Robb Stark, Joffrey, Tyrion, and Jaime were truly compelling. There is much to like about this book, but the overly-detailed writing bogs it down for me.<br /><br />I'm also wondering why there is so much detail spent on certain characters. I get that Arya is learning how to survive in some harsh situations, but where is her story going? A glimmer of direction would help. Instead, I keep asking myself &#34;So what?&#34; The same is true of some of Bran's chapters. They could have been deleted or at least condensed without readers missing anything.<br /><br />Four books remain in the series, but after three drawn-out tomes, I'm not looking forward to them with excitement and anticipation. Rather, it's with a sense of gearing up for an ordeal. The only thing that keeps me reading is that I want to know what happens next
B0049J2BSM|5.0|The story, the innocence, the music, the actors...this is easily one of Pixar's best movies. It's nice to have movies you feel good about letting your kids watch; all the while you secretly get to enjoy them too!
B006VREQ0G|1.0|Terrible playback. Multiple amazon errors interrupted playback throughout show. Difficult to watch without interruption.  Will not purchase again on the future.
B00009P1O2|5.0|I think their music is great though I should have just bought the cd.  The lead singer has a great voice and it is amazing to listen to the vocals.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Well done characterization and interesting choice of scene and time, wartime military family with growth of character evident-recommended for all
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|An instant classic great for anyone. I love pinball even more on my kindle. The Star Wars part is just an extra. Not so hot on the idea of you have to buy the other tables, but still a fun game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|even after I shut my kindle down the app wont open again. the overall app is great and is one of my favorites.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This books puts losing weight and getting healthy into simple terms.  There is just enough science to help you understand the why's but not confuse you or make you want to stop reading.<br /><br />This is a must have if you are serious about correcting your health!
0066620996|1.0|Specious if not outright gullible logic. Should be an example of how NOT to analyze. Dependencies of success are derived from \\"hours of conversations with his students\\", now, if that statement by itself didn't throw you into a condescending laughter, read on... You will find out why his not only good (or very good), but GREAT companies were behind the worst financial meltdown of all times.

B002ODEJYE|4.0|I chose to give this rateing a 4/ Stars. If you like Pink and her Music. I highly recommend it!! She is (&#34;HOT&#34;) don't you think?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've heard of the Hunger Games before, and tried to watch the movie, but the first parts were boring, but this book always leaves you on edge, which makes it great. The best part is the love that Katniss and Peeta share, but Katniss only pretends to love Peeta to stay alive. This book is amazing, you should read it, you'll get hooked. Also Read Catching Fire and Mockingjay.
B001L1S1SK|5.0|I chose this 5/ Star rateing because I LOVED the show and it was Funny, Sadness, Drama!!! I highly recomend it!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is good for ages 4 and up and its a really good game me and my family love this game and I also have this game on my fine and it kills time and it a like addicting addicting I love this game
B0094K20FK|5.0|This is a classic and a must see before seeing the latest Star Trek movie.  There is a link that must be made to fully understand the story and appreciate the full impact. It would be a shame not to make the connection as the story continues in a time travel altered new reality.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love all the things that you can do with your horse like you can actually do in real life.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am about mid way through the book but loving it so far! Very confusing with all of the characters but gets easier as you go.
B00005JXY3|5.0|This movie is an 80's sequel classic. I love this movie. I just finished watching it and I just ordered part 3. Ralph played Daniel great. Its hard to believe this movie is almost 30 years old. So happy with this dvd. I am going to recommend this dvd in the future
B001LM1456|4.0|saw it before-added to my avengers collection, although its the wrong banner-hulk 2 has the right guy in it,so need hulk 2
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a great movie. It is an excellent way to tell the story of civil rights during the 60's in Jackson, MS. This movie brought Viola Davis an academy award. This movie is great I am so going to recommend it.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Love this app, it's awesome! I use this every night and I'm amazed at how much it helps me relax and sleep. It distracts from the nightly sounds, as well as the many thoughts racing through my brain. Even if I wake up through the night, unlike before, where I'd be awake the rest of the night, tossing and turning. I drift right back to sleepy land! It's awesome!
B008VBYN80|3.0|The game is fun but alot of time is spent visiting friend's to get stars and you need alot of stars. Diamond's are the most important and you don't get enough playing the game so you have to use real money to get them. The buttons in the friends part are not convenient you end up going home instead of giving a gift. I have a kindle fire and most people I talk to have the same problem.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Perfect if you somehow destroy the ear-tip that fits your ear and can't use one of the other sizes provided.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Another excellent read from Lee Child. It was very difficult to put this book down. I will be reading more of Jack Reacher.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I've watched it twice now and I don't think I'll ever get sick of it. The actors played their roles perfectly, the music is great, and I just can't say enough good things about this movie. Honestly, it should have won the Oscar but for some reason it wasn't even in the running.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|This was a very well written book that captivated your mind. The plot was well thought out, and it was hard not to feel for the main character, Lena. It is a must read if you enjoy dystopian novels.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved the first Temple Run and was very excited when Temple Run 2 came out.  It is better and so much more addicting.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|always leaves you wanting more.  Almost as good as breaking bad.<br />I would reccomend it to anyone who likes suspense.
B0024FA9IM|5.0|This was a great remake of a classic TV series that I grew up with and while there were differences between the old TV series and the movie it is a movie that is well worth the price. If you enjoy great Sci-Fi action add this one to your collection.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I really like this game. I have other games similar and I really enjoy playing them. Some of the levels are harder but I eventually figure them out.GREAT GAME!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing story!  Incredibly suspenseful -I couldn't put it down.  I heard about this series on wcnc.com, in an article about the author, and I'm so glad I did.  It's truly captivating and I'm thrilled to hear of the success he's enjoying with this story, as it is well deserved.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I was initially bummed by the shorter season (real life birth of a baby is a worthy excuse) but the plot lines for the season were thoroughly entertaining. It is well worth the investment.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Enjoyed the continued storyline.  Plenty of ups and downs.  Let's the romantic in us live on through these characters.  Quick read.
B004P1JDJO|4.0|Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us by Daniel H. Pink is a book about the evolution of what motivates people.  Pink takes the stand that people are motivated not by external rewards such as salary but by the intrinsic rewards that create the feeling of satisfaction.  Pink makes this argument by breaking the book into three sections.  The first section takes a critical look at the typical reward and punishment system.  Pink identifies the mainstream view on motivation and introduces his view that human motivation is really driven by three things.  Pink asserts that what really drives people are the \\"need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world\\" (p. 10).  The next section looks at individual and organization behaviors that can improve motivation, increase production, and amplify worker satisfaction.  The third section is Pink's \\"toolkit\\" on how to increase motivation.<br /><br />  This book was written in a clear, easy to follow format.  Pink does a skilled job of summarizing the studies he researched into manageable, easy to read portions of the book for readers who do not have background in research.  The structures helps the flow of the content as Pink leads the reader from point to point.  Pink made some thought provoking points about what helps people do their best work.  I agree with him that people strive to have autonomy, mastery, and purpose.  While Pink does acknowledge that there are times and circumstances when the \\"carrot and stick\\" approach to motivate people does get results, I thought it would have been helpful if he had addressed this area more in depth.  I also think he should have provided more information in the \\"toolkit\\" section of the book on how people and organizations can switch their motivational strategies.  Overall this book was an interesting read that gave me new ideas to ponder.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to motivate a group or themselves.
B000IDEORY|5.0|This is a go to feel good movie, great soundtrack, good story and always leaves me with a smile. I highly recommend it.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was a book club selection and I was surprised by how much I liked it. I was caught up in the story when the author says I am standing in the crowd waiting to go into the circus. I enjoyed the fantasy aspect of the novel and some of the imagery that describes different parts of the circus. There is magic and mystery in the story. I felt like I had been at the circus and I missed it when the book was over. The book club had mixed reviews but I really liked it.
0374214913|2.0|Caveat: I did not subject myself to reading the whole thing.<br /><br />I got a few chapters in and starting wondering if it got better later on. Checked reviews. It seems I am not the only reader finding it lacking. Yep, we got technology. Far out and groovy. This was a decent little short story - it's posted on the author's website - expanded into a book. Let's add some young hipsters, create an elevator speech to distinguish them from each other, make it a techno- thriller, add some more metaphysical stuff, to broaden the appeal.<br /><br />I'm always surprised when a decent article or short story is padded out to be a full book with needless details, repetition, and over-explaining and the book sells so well.<br /><br />I agree that it should be classified as Young Adult.<br /><br />Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.<br /> ~ Arthur C. Clark
B001PTG4BO|3.0|When I read the book when it was first published I was thrilled. it made sense back then. but now, mostly because of the social media revolution, it had lost most of its logic and reason. the short head is the opposite of the long tail. the short head theory claims that many of the long tail assumptions and conclusions are no longer valid and that what we are seeing in the last several years is exactly the opposite. there is a blog under that name - www.theshorthead.com. Interesting way of thinking.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Although it helps to have read the books, or watch the movie with someone who has, it is a beautifully filmed movie that's a joy to watch.  I was assisted much with understanding the story by asking my husband about particular parts, but the fantasy story does stand on its own.  The acting is terrific, as are the special effects.  We really enjoyed the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I didn't have the opportunity to watch the series on TV but heard the rave reviews.  I can see why!
0345529057|5.0|As emotionally trying as it is, I love this brutally violent, deeply disturbing, ingenious series. Martin is a genius! His world is so detailed and intricate, his characters are COMPLETELY captivating (I cannot stress this enough - I normally don't reads books this violent and upsetting, but the characters keep me coming back time and time again like a drug addict). However, you should know that you will watch your favorite characters suffer terribly in this harsh world.  Here's an example of the kind of world we're dealing with. As a non-noble woman in Martin's world, it's nothing short of a miracle to make it through life without being raped at least once, likely even gang raped, in front of your family.  Even many noble women are unable to achieve a rape-free life.  Thankfully, Martin doesn't usually describe the rapes (although in a couple of instances he briefly does).  That stuff is hard for me to get through, but I know many people today are so desensitized, they don't really care (or maybe I'm just very sensitive :).  I'm almost done with the fifth book, A Dance with Dragons (not included in this box set). My rating of the books is as follows (from favorite to least favorite): 1) A Storm of Swords  2) A Game of Thrones  3) A Clash of Kings  4) A Dance with Dragons  5) A Feast for Crows.  I definitely recommend this series, but if your the less desensitized type (like me), be prepared to be deeply upset (even depressed at times), disturbed, and heartbroken.  BUT IT'S STILL WORTH IT!
193700788X|1.0|IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT-DON'T. JUST STICK WITH THE PREVIOUS BOOK AND MAKE UP YOUR OWN ENDING. GUARANTEED TO BE A BETTER ENDING THAN THIS!!!!<br /><br />I have read every one of the books in this series immediately after publication. I would shun friends, skip work, cancel appointments-you name it because you couldn't and wouldn't put them down.<br /><br />This was a joke. OK so we all saw the end result coming at some point however DIDN'T YOU MISS SOMEBODY? He' appears twice then poof-nothing? Are you serious?!?!?! Minor nothing characters got much too much attention and other major characters were all but nonexistent.<br /><br />Is this the work of HBO Charlaine?  Tell me you're not a sell out.....<br /><br />What a letdown to your true fans. (Not your True Blood fans). I don't even watch the show I loved these books so much!  I didn't want to taint such a great set of books!!!<br /><br />And I thought I was bummed that this was the last book. That's nothing compared to how cheated I feel after this \\"ending\\".<br /><br />It's a shame. I've never written a review before but felt compelled to do so in case she may actually read these and know the thoughts of her dedicated readers. YOU KNOW...THE ONES BEFORE THE SHOW. THE ONES WHO GOT YOU THE SHOW???<br /><br />Write another book CH. Finish this properly.<br /><br />My constant recommendations to friends stopped once I read this.
0812550706|5.0|This is exactly what I want out of a sci-fi novel: a thrilling, fast-paced plot; a complex, sympathetic main character who's full of surprises and just downright awesome; unexpected twists; and underlying deep, philosophical/moral questions. I wish I had read this years ago when I first bought it instead of waiting until now. HIGHLY recommend!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love the game one time I played it for seven hours four hours straight and the the rest later
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was really interesting and I really enjoyed it. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for something to read.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Replacing some of my older 'albums' (keeping them safe and pristine).<br />Wish they were still at it (like the 'Stones')!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This game is worth getting but it lags a lot and can get extremely annoying I really don't recommend buying but only somethings about it are fumbling besides that it blows
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Funny! A bit over the top, but still funny. Glad I saw it, but don't require to own it. Heard there will be #2 soon.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm a nerd for nostalgic games and media, so a novel that touches on such topics - while constructing an interesting cyber-future story simultaneously - is right up my alley.  It can be difficult to emulate nerdiness in a book unless you are a nerd yourself, and thankfully Ernest Cline is the right kind of nerd.<br /><br />Ready Player One is the story of... oh come on, you've read the description, all you need to know is if it's enjoyable.  With the subject matter being primarily old video games, I can be pretty picky.  All of the references made, from Joust to Zork and from Highlander to Family Ties, feel like conversations nerds can actually have in the world constructed, which really makes this an accurate read for anyone with memories of such entertainments.  I really can't find anything terribly wrong with the book as a whole, other than that it could alienate someone who isn't as deep into the fandoms as I am.  It was all gold for me.<br /><br />For the geek you're shopping for, or the geek in you, it should be a wonderful experience.
B007FO5PYK|4.0|Even if the end of the story seems too much ''hollywood's fairy tales'', it is a great actor's play by Al Pacino.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|I do like this movie a lot. I can't call it great and it is probably a tad confusing if you haven't read the book, but like I said I really like it.
B0076I624W|5.0|Playing a ''dead entity'' is surely not an easy thing to do, but Brad Pitt do it very well. The romantism of this movie is built on a great screenplay....but most of all, even the beautiful scoring, it's the performance (again!) of Mr Anthony Hopkins. He is perfect.
B00BMQDM10|3.0|In general I liked this book. It's funny and interesting. I really liked the story between Fliss and Lorcan.<br />But part of the book which I really really didn't like is where Fliss and Nico are trying to stop Lottie and Ben from having sex. That part is so stupid and naive that I asked myself even why I read this book. Hello, rent a car or call a taxi, go away from that hotel and have sex on some beach, in another hotel, or whenever you wish on that island.<br />Kinsella writing is great and funny as usual but please next time make your main girl character a little bit smarter. I am a bit tired of that stupid poor girls who have someone else to take care of them.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard changed the way I use my phone. I  can type long emails with so much less effort. The addition of Flow was the cherry on top. I love SwiftKey!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|The app does exactly what it is intended to do. I would recommend it to anyone that needs to work in fractions.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|This movie is wonderfully acted especially by Hoffman and Juaquin Phoenix.  The movie leaves you with an ominous feeling.  Is very dark in its story-line.  I know people can have lives like this but it's not something a soft-hearted may want to watch.  It's a good rental.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|If you like free flow, you will like this game. It starts out easy and plaster somber of the levels are a littler tricky. Just the kind of game I like to play after work
B002NJUN44|3.0|dont really care  for the movie , but my girlfriend love the like beyond belief, she wishes that they would have make a second part to the movie.
0316226424|5.0|The book came quickly and in excellent condition. Really fun story too! I enjoyed this book a lot. Would recommend to anyone who likes romance and adventure.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a masterpiece, not just of the Sci-Fi genre, but of true literature.  Card not only gives us vibrant characters and an attention-grabbing plot, but thoroughly analyzes human nature and, ultimately, what it is to be human.  Simply brilliant.
B007RQ6WCA|2.0|Stupid app will not open without some other app and it wont download on my tablet. It is pretty useless at this point.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|A fun game but without paying you cant grow your base. Quite frustrating if you want to seriously play it
1439153663|5.0|This book was great! It held my attention and I couldn't wait to see how it would end. Great portrayal of southern life decades ago.
B00COMLLX2|4.0|I've only played two tables. I love the first one (Sorcerer's Lair). The graphics and sound are great, and the table is easy to follow and understand. The second table I tried (Shaman) was too busy and harder to get the feel for. As you have to buy each table rather than unlock them, I don't know how many more I'll get around to trying, but I'm having fun with the one table.
0062060562|5.0|This book was amazing! Passed it around at work and we all loved it. You can't wait to see what will happen next.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie is pretty crazy.  I rated it high because it has good acting in it and everything.  It is very UNbelievable as far as the story line goes - but its a movie - to entertain us - to take two hours of our lives.  Its worth watching.
1476712042|5.0|I loved this book! It grabbed me from the start and I couldn't put it down. Left me anxious to see what happens next.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I am only four episodes in and i know I have seen them all (years ago) but it is fun watching it all over again and seeing how much everyone has changed over the years.
1439102732|5.0|Even though I am not a fan of heavy religion in books, this was a spectacular read!! As usual, Jodi Picoult got me all riled up and I couldn't wait to see how it would end!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is a nice RTS to kill time with.  The graphics are good and it runs well on my kindle fire.  The game seems to have the same simple rules/deep gameplay as Advance Wars.  The minor problem I have is the lack of a more robust tutorial system.  This game has a lot going on and I have too often felt a little lost about what's going on.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This is exactly what I needed. Comes with a diffuser plus 2 filters which i did not know of but much appreciated. Makes my images look 100 times better.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This movie is amazing.  It is so good I saw it 3 times in theatres.  I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that it was completely satisfying.  I recommend this to people that love a good sci-fi movie.  And even if you don't, you should give this a shot, it's totally worth it.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|I've been waiting for the film of this legendary Supertramp concert to be released for years, as many of their  fans have. In my opinion and in terms of record sales, this was one of the top acts of the 70's whether you loved them or not. This film captures the band at the height of it's powers in 1979, when they released the HUGE album \\"Breakfast in America\\" which really put them on the map as a global mega-selling hit making machine. Well deserved for Supertramp who started off their career with two decent albums that hardly got noticed, \\"Supertramp\\" (1970) and \\"Indelibly Stamped\\"(1971) at the start of the 70's--two records that did nothing to jump start their career, especially in an era where they were playing music that was a cross between The Beatles and Spooky Tooth when prog-rock bands like Rush, Yes and Genesis were beginning to stake their claim with 12 minute epic compositions. Not to say that Supertramp weren't talented, their career hinged on keyboardist/pianist Rick Davies blues and jazz leanings and guitarist Roger Hodgson's folky George Harrison and Beatle-esque songwriting chops. It just seemed that they didn't have the chemistry within the band line-up at the time but with the addition of new members that lead to the creation of the fantastic masterpiece \\"Crime of the Century\\" in 1974.<br /><br />Through the rest of the 70's this classic new line-up with Davies, Hodgson, John Helliwell on sax, Bob Benberg on drums, and Dougie Thomson on bass went on to record some great polished albums with Ken Scott behind the board and some moderate FM hits, \\"Dreamer\\", \\"Bloody Well Right\\", \\"Crime of the Century\\", \\"Give a Little Bit\\", etc.<br /><br />\\"Breakfast in America\\" was about as Beatle-esque that Supertramp could get while infusing their catchy hooks, melodies arrangements and musical interplay. It was the one album that had most of the bands hits, sadly it was the beginning of Hodgson's departure from the band, and less hits would follow throughout the 80's.<br />Davies and Hodgson were poles apart musically and every album was a challenge to fuse the jazz and blues influences with the pop and rock influences.<br /><br />Their 1979 in Paris solidified their place in rock history forever. All one has to do is listen to how great the double live set \\"Paris\\" is. The concert features versions of their songs that are superior to the original album versions, top quality production as they were known for and they play each song note for note to perfection. The band is having fun onstage in this dvd, which on the album you get just a little sense of. John Helliwell is not only a superb saxophonist, but a humourous MC that truly fits Supertramp's onstage persona.<br /><br />The DVD packaging is great, and sadly there are no 2012/2013 interviews with the band which would have made this release much better. Also, some of the concert footage is not available and has been replaced with animations as bonus features. But there is always the live album for continuity. For the longest time I had to watch my copy of \\"Supertramp: the Story So Far\\" which is a great place to find more interviews, music videos and the history of the group as well as an okay German concert from 1983. But this Paris dvd is far better.<br /><br />The slight disappointment for me is that this wonderful dvd release comes at a time in the band's career all these years later, where Davies and Hodgson haven't resolved their decades long issues. A re-union would've been great to herald this release. So despite it all being bittersweet, this dvd still transports one back to a time in rock history where it was all about this great music and musicianship. Supertramp to me is up there with the Beatles, and this a great chance to see them in action and just really rocking these songs out.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Supertramp after all these years. I love their ability to write quirky pop/rock tunes with a sentimental vibe and at times social commentary, while also writing music that stands up well to all the prog-rock groups at the time. Supertramp fused all of those sensibilities into their sound, and made it far more entertaining and accessible. Great vocals and lyrics, excellent productions and performed with dynamics that give you the chills. I am fan of Davies' version of Supertramp and also Hodgson and his solo work, it's hard for me to not like anything that they both do. But what they created together in this classic line-up will always be their best work. Many fans are divided, but this would have never all been possible if they never met.<br /><br />I truly enjoy this awesome and amazing concert, it is great for both new fans and and old. It is a great introduction to the music of Supertramp and also for die hard fans. Don't get much better than this unless they have some more live gems in the vaults, but for me, this concert really wets the appetite. The sound quality is perfect!
B0093LINVK|3.0|I've ordered these a few times. However the past 3 times from Amazon I get the unit with the power brick but no cord to plug into the wall...Not sure why that is.<br /><br />Oddly enough the product's page is linked to the correct power cord. But I can't imagine Intel would sell these without the power cord.<br /><br />A bit bizarre.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Hadn't read the book, but found the movie very enticing.  Wasn't overly obvious, had twists to keep storyline interesting.  :)
0062059963|5.0|I was instantly hooked on this series!  Can not wait for the next book in the series. Would highly recommend this book!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I wouldn't call this a page turned but it was a very good book. Good plot and well written. My only complaint was that it got a little too technical for the layman at times.
0812550706|2.0|I went into reading Enders Game thinking that it would be amazing. Several of my friends had read it and told me it would be, \\"definitely a must read.\\" This is what might have lead to my disappointment.<br /><br />The main character in the story is six in the beginning, and ends around age twelve, so this criticism may be misplaced, but I felt that the main character was too self absorbed and the book only repeated his musings. We are constantly being told that Ender is a genius that Ender is the best and that he is the only hope for 300 pages while he goes through school, drills and games. I was pretty much done with this immature attitude, half way through the book, but kept going because of the hype that it would get better.<br /><br />Again, I was told by so many people that there was a twist at the end of the book. The twist was incredibly anticlimactic. Without revealing too much I felt like I did this whole journey with Ender, building his character and who he was, and then it just ended. There was no tension, there was no build up, it was just over.<br /><br />I might just feel this way because the book was overhyped for me, but at the end I really couldn't say that I liked the book or that there was any intrigue. I wouldn't recommend the book to a friend.
B002RVZV9K|1.0|Could not play because it was not compatable with australia`s DVD players. it will cost me more to send back than what i payed for was not happy it happend twice 2 of the DVD i receved from you sent 1 back
B009AMANBA|5.0|Absolutely brilliant movie, well cast and very well acted and directed. The whole scene for this movie is Abraham Lincoln's fight to get the 13th Amendment to the American constitution passed, this amendment frees the blacks who are used as slaves and outlaws slavery in any shape or form. Lincoln is adamant that he is going to get this law passed and he has to make some very intense and at times very dodgy deals to obtain votes. Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field are very believable as Abraham and Mary Lincoln, Steven Spielberg turns on his usual brilliant direction and makes this film brilliant in it's story, the characters of Abe Lincoln and also Mary Lincoln are so believable that you could almost swear that you were there at the time in history, 1865, that these events took place. This film is an absolute must see.
B000ICXQU6|4.0|so many questions unanswered here, a woman this intelligent can't figure out how to class it up a tad in a LAW office? a woman this intelligent hooks up with loser, clueless men who just wanna check out those huge boobies, what a boob! a woman this charismatic, winner of Miss Nowhere, and can't get a job or a man?  I will admit to the admiration of the true life Erin B. and her ability to get those 634 signatures in one week, that is a movie on it's own imho...  This is the first Julia film that portrays her bad angle, the sad sak story on the bed w/George just made her features harsh and more of that to come unfortunately, what a gorgeous woman who just lost her looks and just can't put a finger on where.... the hair, lips, eyes, ????  should have showcased the real Erin more in the film, she is one hottie w/a mega bod, Julia looks like a 10yo boy w/pushup bra...  wish I had her money in the early days to buy that seXy wardrobe... felt bad for ol' George watching those kids 24/7 and not getting any, who would expect a guy for ANY amount of cash to do that job??  soooo, high recommend: David vs Goliath routine drama, Aaron Eckhart w/long hair n harley, and some notable quotables i.e. STFU KRISPY KREME!!! priceless...
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This bingo game is fun and exciting. I love all the different rooms and places pulse all the different slots. They even give you free bingo`s,power up and other free stuff.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This is part of an on going Sookie story - there were parts that I hated and others that I loved - I don't want to give anything away but.....I want Sookie to end up with Eric!!!!!
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Major events taking place in season 7. More interesting than many of the previous seasons.They're getting ready to wrap things up.
B000VSYDRM|4.0|Unusual topic and made for a very interesting film experience.  Also good as a period piece making it very atmospheric.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love the convenience of having a dictionary on my Kindle Fire. The audio feature that pronounces words is helpful. I also like the connections to the internet which allow me to find more information about the words I look up.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I have played many different games like this one. WOW is the main o bv e that comes to mind. This game blows all of them out of the water! I would recommend it to everybody! I'll never pay another game of this sort again except this one. Please keep adding content, and let's get some more characters!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is definitely a very addictive game.  I have spent a lot of time playing this game. Looks easy but beware you are not always on the right track. Love this game!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Downloaded and played on Kindle Fire.  This game is superb!  I never got stuck in the Manager's Office or anywhere else in the game.  I never had any problems described by other reviewers, this game was terrific and I highly recommend it!  To the people who expect a hidden object/puzzle game for FREE -- forget it!  Almost all games that are any fun give &#34;free&#34; up to a certain point but to get the full entertainment value -- you gotta pay.  Kindle Fire cost was $2.49... how cheap is that?  Very reasonably priced, and worth the money.<br /><br />The only &#34;hint&#34; I have is to use the map when you don't know where to go next.  The diary is useless but the map gives you information while still letting you maneuver on your own around the game and it (the map) is much more clear than the hint button.<br /><br />Uh, one thing to the developers: please check on the continued message HUD_HELPERS_HOITWON&APOS;TWORK.  It didn't interrupt or hinder the game but it was annoying none-the-less.<br /><br />GET THIS GAME, IT'S GOOOOOOOD :)
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Honestly i love this App but sometimes it will stop working for no reason and i have no clue why. I think it neeeds to be updated a little bit more.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This game is tough, but I'm still a newbie at hidden object/puzzle games. It seemed as though I was back-tracking a lot and I had some difficulty maneuvering through the foggy park areas.  I still rated 5 stars because the game is a definite challenge if that's what you're looking for, and if you have more experience than I do then I'm sure you will love this game!  The puzzles were difficult but as I said before, if you are experienced, you will enjoy them!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|if I were you I would get this game because its so awesome! its so fun and spoiler alert you get a lot of money when you do a neck flip!
B006LSZECO|5.0|As far as psychological thrillers, this was top-notch. Insightful into today's twenty-something marriages/relationships, with a deft use of humor, tight characterization, and masterful plotting.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I am so glad I bought the Blu Ray version of Rome! I already own the DVDs and watched them many times, so I wasn't sure spending the money for the Blu Ray would be worth it. I's great! The detail is so vivid I feel like I am on location with them. I can see the play of sunlight on surfaces, the threads of the fabric, I notice so many things in the background that I missed or ignored before. I think it is because HBO/BBC put such effort into the details of the settings and background that this is in truth the best Blu -Ray I have ever seen. Buy it!!
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|This boy works himself through several unique and fascinating challenges, but the story itself is too introspective, and from a confused boy's point of view, that means the reader feels confused a lot of the time. The ending is wonderful, Ford's analysis of why and how a man would look back at that childhood is the true value of this book. I would not recommend it to my book club, the issues are not really evaluated, they simply just happen, so you never really connect with the boy until the very end when he's reflecting on how far he's had to go to get back to 'normal.'
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A great read with much insight into the animal kingdom, human behaviour and religions. Saw Ang Lee's movie first and got captivated by this book after. Both works are one-of-its-kind!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Idea of a mysterious movable circus with magical powers is fascinating, but the narrative tension is missing for the most part. Possibilities unexplored, motivations left unspoken, too many characters. I will try her next book because the weaknesses here are offset by her imagination and are correctable with practice. Better editing could have helped this book.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|movie was awesome i watch it all the time, even though i would have wished more screen time for batman and bane nonetheless they showed just enough. everybody gave exceptional performances. bane is easily one of the top villains of all time. ending was a little cliche but still enjoyed and the all the extra stuff that comes with it is nice special features and what definitely a must buy.
B00CRW2066|5.0|The National continue to hone their sound and make music that is beautiful, dark and pleasing to my ears. It's also a brilliant lyrical masterpiece.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|this is easily one of best movies of all time great story great cast exceptional performances by Arnold, Linda, Patrick, and Edward. Movie was just simply awesome if you are an Arnold this is a must have and the special features is awesome. I watch this movie at least once a month. deleted scenes are horrible im glad they werent in the original cut of the movie thats probably the only negative about the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't wait to read the next one. The movie is nothing compared to the book, can't wait for the next movie.
0790731002|3.0|movie wasnt as bad as it got credited me being an avid batman fan i had no choice but to like it, it had an awesome cast i wouldve expected something better plot was predictable. i did still enjoyed the movie i watch from time to time. i would recommend to any batman as a laugher to just watch and have a few laughs
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Well acted depressing movie. worth watct display of a raging hing but not a feel good kind of movie. grea
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This makes changing recipes SOOO much easier!  I CAN do the math without the calculator, but  it takes a lot more time to do so.
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|This album is full of beautiful harmony, soaring melodies and synthy pop goodness that isn't too over the top.<br /><br />Opening with \\"Pompeii\\"-which brings to mind imagined images of the actual event with an enchanting opening chorus.  It's worth noting that the band got to perform this song at The British Museum at the Pompeii exhibit!<br /><br />\\"Overjoyed\\" is perhaps one of the best tracks on the record.  Simple repetition of what can be described as haunting lyrics.  \\"I hear you calling in the dead of night\\" invokes memories of scenarios as diverse as the lives of listeners.<br /><br />Every song on the record is amazing but other personal stand-outs are \\"Icarus\\", \\"Oblivion\\", \\"Flaws\\" and \\"Laura Palmer\\" the latter named after the character on the popular TV show \\"Twin Peaks\\".<br /><br />The band centers around Dan Smith and his vocal talents but the band provides great back-up vocals and simple instrumentals that make Bastille greater than what any member would be solo.<br /><br />Buy this record, you'll be spinning it all summer!  Worth the cost of importing for fellow Americans!
B00CS7ZIHI|3.0|While there are some songs on the album that I like very much, overall it's a little too 80s synth-pop for me to be able to give it more than an average rating. I do appreciate the fact that 30STM continues to evolve, I'm just not sure that I'll be along for the ride much longer. (For reference, Beautiful Lie was my favorite album of theirs...a little less raw than their eponymous offering, but not so produced as the last two.)<br /><br />The Good:<br />Birth: Very cool sound that builds interestingly as it progresses. I wish it had been a bit longer.<br />Conquistador: Just plain fun, the sort of song you can't help bouncing along with.<br />End of All Days: Probably my favorite song on the album. It has a sensual, almost bluesy feel to it.<br />Convergence: Just a nice little instrumental interlude.<br />Northern Lights: The orchestral elements help balance out the synth so it's not so overwhelming as in some of the other songs. Jared's voice also has a nice combination of angst and sex. Something in the drums reminds me a little of NIN.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Up in the Air: Overall, this is on my 'indifferent' list, but part of the chorus is lyrically distasteful enough to me to bump it to 'bad.' Or possibly just 'ick.' Maybe I need an 'ick' list.<br />City of Angels: Even if writing a love song to a city weren't inherently a little silly, RHCP did it better with Under the Bridge.<br />Pyres of Varanasi: Whatever that keyboard mashing sound is, all I hear is the stupid horn from Inception. It ruins it for me.<br />Bright Lights: Wherein Jared Leto makes a list.<br /><br />The Indifferent:<br />The Race: I like it better than Do or Die, but there's nothing special about it in my opinion.<br />Do or Die: Meh.<br />Depuis Le D&eacute;but: It's interesting, but I'm not sure the various pieces actually mesh.<br /><br />In summation: This album is not musically offensive to me, but is also not really my taste. It's just OK.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I love the beautiful graphics, but I don't like how slow the game plays out because it takes too much time to earn the items you need most to move along in the game. And I will NEVER pay real money to progress in a game. If it comes to that point, I'll be leaving Nemo and his beautiful coral reef! Right now I really like it!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Great movie all around.  It was funny, witty, and it pulled on your heart a bit.  Perfect movie for the whole family.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best season ever!!! If you love The Walking Dead series...do not miss this season...I can't wait for season 4 to see what happens next...
B00CWVFPGO|5.0|This movie was really good. Arnold really stepped up his A game in this movie and did a great job for someone that hasn't been in movies in a long time. Totally recommend this movie
B000KJU1MS|5.0|I bought this for my little sister who loves Kiss, and she loves this dvd. It was the last one to complete her collection and it arrived in perfect condition and in good time. There is a lot of content in this collection, perfect for any fan.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan of the Alien movies... this movie didn't dissapoint, it left me wannting more followup sequels! Highly recommend this Amazon merchant.
B00267QOEQ|5.0|Adam Sandler is my favorite actor, so when he makes a movie i got to have it for my collection.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Just finished &#34;me before you&#34; and I am drying my tears.... This book has stirred up a lot of emotions for me and not in a bad way!
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie. Its one of our favorites the movie is a little on the darker side but it dosent scare my 3 year old and she watches it every day.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Funny, sweet, sexy, full of truths we either don't want to admit, and I loved that this book was from a mans perspective.
B00314VYNE|5.0|My daughter loves her jessie doll fron toy story 2 and 3. Shes super cute and she has taken a beating and still looks new. She is cuter then the disney doll in my opinion im glad we bought this one instead of the disney store one.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|A lot of math and facts about states and cities and population.not as much action as usual. Still, a Reacher novel.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I had several friends recommend this show, but I couldn't get into it when I tried to join the show late.  Now that i could see it from the beginning, I'm hooked.  The characters are brilliant and ruthlessly fight for their clients who usually ends up being on the side of &#34;good&#34;.  How can we not love them?  Take my advice and catch up in this show.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have heard a lot about the series but it exceeded my expectations.  After I purchased season 1, seasons 2 & 3 immediately followed.  Cannot wait for Season 4 in the fall.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|while the reason i wanted to see it was because of Ezra Miller (he blew me away in The Perks of Being a Wallflower) & Tilda Swinton the real scene stealer was John C Reilly who we've rarely seen in serious roles. He's amazing as the Father whose son is the apple of his eye.  even if his view of his son is off...<br /><br />this movie is a thriller, horror, even touching in moments. it stays with you days after you've watched it. your heart will break, you'll gasp in disbelief, and you might even be left feeling a lil sad & numb<br /><br />top notch acting from the cast, great cinematography, and the camera angles really pull you into the scenes<br /><br />to be honest im getting chills remembering certain scenes...
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|love this game! easy to play... no money required... the price was right... itreegamer games are my new favorites! get it and ha e fun :)
B009K86D86|5.0|Every American should see this Documentary! WE are all looking for an alternative to making the FDA more proactive and operating in the cosumers interest.
B00CW665VI|5.0|See the title of this review...that's not even the best line of the book. Just one of many. In reality, I prob should have just highlighted the entire book. It was that good. I need more Drew Evans. Kate and Drew are FAN-F*ing-tastic together. (See what I did there, loophole). I want another book about them. But I would also like more Alexandra and Delores. They seem like they would both be big bags of fun if you put them together in a room. Ok, you get the idea, right. So why haven't you read this book yet? Stop what you're doing NOW and read it. Why are you still here?? GO!
B005OT2YVA|1.0|The storyline does not fit together well. It is as if the director focused on showing fighting robots and he forgot about scripting, acting, drama, etc. It uses classic cliches to try and evoke emotional responses, but it is so poorly done that I had to laugh.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Constant stream of surprises.  Watching season 2 on Ruko and can't seem to stop watching one episode after another. Enjoyed season 1.
0061438294|5.0|This book builds a new toolbox for you to use in your daily life.<br /><br />Navarro does a great job of separating the idea of a tell from a lie. Many people assume that cues automatically mean guilt or that the person is lying. Navarro constantly reminds us that as much as we often like to believe this, we should retain healthy skepticism before assuming guilt.<br /><br />There are many different surprising insights by Navarro throughout the book. Whether a school teacher, businessman, or salesperson, I think that anyone will learn something from this book.
B002VCR03A|2.0|I am deeply torn on this one. Firstly; the book was first published November 2008, but the 5 star reviews date from JULY 2008. Can someone explain this???<br />I always read the best and worst reviews on any book. This one I downloaded the sample and I don`t know what to think; The 1 & 2 * reviewers mention how selfish and self centred Katsa is. She mistreats her horses: WHAT.... ANIMAL ABUSE? She lashes out physically at anyone that disagrees with her on anything. She certainly sounds narcissistic to me..... not the ideal heroin for any age, let alone YA.<br />None of these charachteristics are apealing to me.<br />When I read the sample however, she seemed caring and controlled. This is where my confusion lies.<br />DID the author change the book since these first 1 & 2* reviews came out, OR am I in for an unpleasant surprise when I buy the book??????<br /><br />The price is also a concern to me; definately too high for kindle. This is what I pay for Terry Pratchet books, not for an unknown author who promotes violence over reasoning and animal abuse.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love  subway surfers I can't get enough of it im always doing some mission every time I get an update
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Nice screen. Good controls. Typical free cell game. Great for waiting room.  laughed when the first achievement trophy popped, being a ps3 trophy hunter.
B008JFUMDS|3.0|We went and saw this movie last night. The acting was good, there were some great action scenes, but I have to say that this movie left a lot of questions. There were spots where it were boring, and drawn out. I felt that the movie was all over the place. Sequences were out of place with no explanation whatsoever. This movie left us wanted answers without really getting any. Possibly a good renter, but I would not spend full ticket price on this one like we did. Bummer.<br /><br />Christopher Berry
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Once again Jodi Picoult makes you think.  I really enjoyed this novel.  The love story was heartbreaking & the courtroom drama w as riveting.
0767847431|5.0|Again, one my favorite Sinbad movies.  I love all the &#34;special effects&#34;  Fun to watch and good quality in the DVD
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Being a huge baseball fan this one held my interest all the way thru.  And it also showed if you believe in an idea you shouldn't drop it because it's different.
B007EDYN36|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of Eddie Trunk...I'm glad I was listening to his show the day he was shilling for this book, because it led me to this fantastic book by the drummer of one of my all time favorite rock bands, KISS.  It's no surprise that Peter Criss had problems with drugs & alcohol, among other things.  The surprise is that he takes full ownership of his faults, flaws and mistakes.  If you're expecting a tell-all that leaves the blame where it belongs, even if that means on the author himself, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />After a few requisite chapters on his early days, Peter dives right into KISStory, sharing his recollection of their humble beginnings to superstardom.  He does not tiptoe around any topic, from his relationships with women, to his substance abuse, to relations within the band.  he speaks frankly and openly about his ouster from the band he created, why his post-KISS career fizzled, how he was tricked into signing away his share of the band, and finally the &#34;all business&#34; reunion of the original lineup and subsequent betrayal by his best friend and &#34;brother&#34;, Ace Frehley.<br /><br />There's not a lot of new information here on KISS' glory days, but it is interesting to read some of the behind the scenes power plays and such.  It's also very enlightening to read his side of the story from the last days of the original lineup and the reunion tours.  And as previously mentioned, it's refreshing to see someone take full accountability for their failures. Peter does his share of fingerpointing, but unlike anything written by Gene or Paul, Peter spends a lot of time pointing the finger squarely at the man in the mirror.
B00867GHS8|5.0|An excellent movie for both kids and adults! The Blu-ray picture and sound quality are simply amazing. With the right setup, it's like you're in the theaters. In my opinion it's a must have to add to your Blu-ray collection. :)
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Good flick! Dramatic yet funny at times. I enjoyed it for sure. A little long I think but not too bad.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I love books from the males perspective!!! It was funny and captivating. I also liked that the heroine was a strong, smart, and successful female! The relationships competitive nature made this a fun read.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I enjoyed this movie. However, I found it to be a bit slow starting. But it as very entertaining by the end.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I bought this dvd set for my daughter. It arrived just as it said it would be. Perfect condition. She loves it. Thanks!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The music is current and sung well. My pre teen nieces love this movie also.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Need I say more.  This band will always be one of my all time favorites.  Adam has an increadible voice and the song writing is complex.  Everything you want in a Maroon 5 album.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|hey guys I like this game because its a first person shooter and also u get to dative real vehicles
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Rihanna doesn't disappoint with this album.  You can tell this woman has loved and lost and has grown from her experiences.  I'm not sure if she writes her own music, but whoever is writing for her (if she doesn't) is super talented.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love the show.  Love the album.  Would recommend it to anyone.  I intend to purchase additional volumes as they become available.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|This game is so easy and yet, so fun to play.  From my 7 year old to my 1 year old, they LOVE it!
B0006VBFM0|4.0|I  really like the styling of this watch.  The colors and the hand written look of the numbers are great details. I also was looking for a watch with a second hand.  I recieve lots of compliments on it.  My only complaint is that it is quite loud.  I teach yoga and sometimes my students can hear it when it is quiet.  I cannot sleep with it on because of the ticking.  I've never had a watch that you could hear without putting it right up to your ear.  One of my students asked me if I had a pacemaker!
B007GE2H3G|4.0|This took me a while to finally watch but once I did was enthralled with how well the animation had captivated my viewing. The design was so well thought out and looked genuinely lighthearted but with it's own personality and look. Great movie. The story line was interesting enough to continue, I'd love to see more like these or perhaps even an animated series where Tin Tin solves on puzzle a week with this animation style.
B0095P29EG|3.0|A comic book with actors instead of drawings.  Some parts fun and some parts hokey.  Light entertainment, even the violence seemed meaningless.
B000A6T1HC|5.0|I haven't stopped playing thiis wonderful recording since I received it her voice is astounding.. The pieces are so interesting. Ii love it
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Does a fine job protecting and displaying the Kindle Fire HD.  Easy to flip open, upright, or flat.  Easy to charge open or closed.  Very pleased I chose this, as it has made using the Fire convenient watching or writing.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|we all love this movie.  great acting, funny, engaging. a new family &#34;classic&#34; that we'll watch even when it's not Easter.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|PLACED TWO OF THESE ON SIDE TRIM OF THE STAIRS. WHEN THE LIGHTING IS LOW AND THEY SENCE MOVEMENT, THEY COME ON AND LIGHT THE WAY, THEN GO OFF AFTER ABOUT 10 SECONDS. PROBLEM SOLVED!
B005NFVZTM|3.0|It was good, but nothing that was super memorable. The good guys were very likeable, but the bad guys were kind of weird and I just didn't find myself caring if they succeeded in their evil plot or not.
B000FC10IO|4.0|It was a great read. All 3 books in a weekend. Fast paced easy read and a simple story line.
B002SKZBQS|2.0|The book itself is three to four stars; however, the Kindle version is littered with spelling and grammatical errors that are not present in the print version (which I also own). If you want to buy this book, opt for the print version.
B002VT6C0K|2.0|I did not like this book of short stories, couldn't wait to finish it.  I don't know if all of Ms Munro's short stories are this negative but I don't think I'll find out unless a specific book is recommended by someone I trust.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|A tragic story of ignorance and hateful ways, only to be crushed from the love and compassion from a family not necessarily related by blood but by circumstance, very good read.
B0057XMCLA|2.0|It cost too many and get so little.  You take a hit of instant service verse bargain shopping.  I know for next time.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Carnival is a great game.  Why I like the story line and scenes between chapters, b/c we've all gotten lost as children at a carnival, and this is exactly how I felt as a child favour it, like my world ended and my pardnts were lost!! The difficulty in this game i found kept me going to the end. I definitely recommend this game!! CARNIVAL DARK ARCANA!
B005544TRQ|5.0|great series well put together, just the right amount of tension and drama to keep you coming back for more
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is the best game ever I would play this game over and over again because its so fun
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really love the cast performances as they intertwine with each other.  It really feels like a like a family both upstairs as well as downstairs.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|nice graphics but could be better during the fight scenes not really bad except the loading takes awhile the first time.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|Gladiator, Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Maximus Decimus Meridius, the story, the history, the landscapes, the music, the ending. Enough said!
B0093FNZT6|3.0|Interesting read, but the story I found was soaking in a sea of medical terminology that even I as a nurse got a bit tired with.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I love this, the characters make me smile !<br />I bought this to keep me busy while I am traveling and sitting in airports

0452289963|5.0|I have read portions of this book and ordered some for my friends, this can be a life changing book.
B00847KFDS|5.0|The singing and playing on this cd are FIRST RATE, and the combination of Fogerty with people like his son on guitar, Joe Morello, Brad Paisley, Bob Seger, Kid Rock, Miranda Lambert, Dave Grohl, etc., make for a superb collection of old and new songs...get it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a great game i would definitely recommend it but it needs to be upgraded to version 0.7.0 ASAP
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Similar to most tile puzzle games, match three and they disappear.  Building the fairy village/palace is pretty motivating, and the puzzles get progressively challenging.  I appreciate the free play mode, it is less stressful.  I recommend this as a quality free download.  The only thing I would improve are the images in the tiles.  In this day and age they could be more artistically done.  No major complaints though.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|After watching this on television I got online and found it on Amazon. I got it and within two weeks I've watched and listened to it and enjoyed it very much.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|It was a funny book about a  loveable caring monster!  My mommy used to read it as a child and rendered it word for word...... I will read it to my children one day!!  8yr old me.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I saw this movie a while back and thought I would like to read the book. It was a fast read.  I told my granddaughter would love it and she did.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Not a big Will Ferrell fan but in this movie he isnt over the top. The much subdued role fits him very well
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|This would have been a day-one pre-order had it contained both the 2D and 3D discs as all the previous Disney Combo sets have done. But by splitting them up -- even with Disney's lame $5.99 mail in offer for the 3D or 2D (depending on the set) version -- sets a terrible precedent and seems greedy and short-sighted. Voting with my pocketbook on this one and not buying it.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Every track is a good one! hope to here more from this band. would like to have seen more album notes included but oh well.
B007FKI9G0|4.0|Very funny movie. This one defintely goes to eleven! Lick my love pump had me rolling on the floor dying !!
B0086449YA|5.0|Standard Mark Knopfler!  Too bad it wasn't a US release. His songwriting ability just keeps getting better and bettter! Keep them coming.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game!!! I wish it had more things to build with like xbox but i still love it!!!
B009ZE27US|4.0|This app is so funny! It's pretty funny how people take this app so seriously. It's supposed to make you sound old! In case you people didn't read the description, it's all a prank! It's fake! So lighten up! Cheese and rice people!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This twenty fifth anniversary show is amazing. It must have been great to see in person, but with this DVD you can experience it over and over.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|If you are a Tarantino's fan, you don't want to miss this one!<br />Great action! great actors! Screenplay is a kicker!
B00CWM3F4C|2.0|Well if I'm comparing it to other recent rock albums from other bands (Soundgarden, Megadeth, etc) it kinda blows... if to older AIC it really sucks... if against last AIC album pretty lame... Stone is the best track IMHO. Get it off of youtube and buy something else. Preferably something that isn't preaching their beliefs like this album does.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Thoroughly entertaining and a satisfying ending to the series. Note: some fans won't like it, but hey, you didn't write it, did you?  I will miss you, Sookie!
B00973DDN2|5.0|Loved it.  I didn't skip any songs on the first listen through, which I can not say for any of their previous albums.<br />Mellower all around, but I like it way more than Sam's Town.
B008220C38|5.0|I got the movie on time and it is absolutely a wonderful movie.<br />Great story, good actors and a unique location.<br /><br />I just love it!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Im an avid Sookie fan, read and reread each story, always anticipating what would come next. Well the conclusion arrived, absolutely terrible. Ruined the entire series for me, I threw each book away, yes the first on my pile was this signed by the author piece of junk!<br /><br />I was in the first chapter and already knew who was dying first, halfway through the book I stopped to think what the hell had happened, it was just ramblings and filler.<br /><br />Then the conclusion....really!? That's how it ends?! So much disappointment I can't even express, I had high hopes loved falling into the world she lived in, I hated every word of this book. It was a terrible end to a great series...well was great. Absolutely ruined!<br /><br />Don't waste your time readers, now matter how tempted you are, you're better off making up your own ending. I promise.
0817439390|5.0|I got an earlier version of this book when I first started in photography, and have given it away at least 4 times.  Great book to help photographers see options available regarding the capture of an image with the variables available in their camera.  This is the ONLY photography book I've owned and read more than once.<br /><br />This book should be required reading for anyone aspiring to become a professional photographer.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|A fantastically written book. The story grabs you and pulls you in very quickly - you really can't wait to find out what happens next. Quirky, entertaining, just slightly creepy. The photos are particularly effective and in some cases a bit creepy. Highly recommended for anyone wanting a not-to-long change of scene in their reading and don't mind putting aside reality just a little. A great young-adult fiction for anyone aged 12 and over.<br /><br />Ransom Riggs leads the reader down an interesting path in this YA novel. The odd and in some cases creepy photos included in the story give faces to some of the very quirky characters contained within the novel. It all starts with Jacob, a sixteen-year-old Florida native who just doesn't quite fit in, and his explanation of the events of Before and After.<br /><br />Jacob, or Yakov as his grandfather pronounces it, has lots of memories of his kinda weird grandfather from his childhood. Abraham told his grandson fantastical stories of his childhood growing up in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, and has photos to back up these stories. What Jacob eventually comes to discover, after a few very unfortunate events, is that his grandfathers tales of his peculiar childhood friends are true.<br /><br />From there he is lead on a wonderful, at times exhilarating and creepy, journey to find where he truly belongs. It's hard to say a lot more about the storyline without giving it away, so I won't. Riggs style of writing is easy to read, and doesn't lead you around in circles. This is a good read for someone who wants a change of pace, and something to fill in a day or so (it's 352 pages, took me a couple of days because I didn't have time to sit and just read it all day).
B00BZOD63S|3.0|No surprises.... kind of saw the scary coming every time but it still worked. It had the Ring feel to it.
0307744434|5.0|If you want a story of intrigue and wonder, and a fantastically built world, then the Night Circus is definitely a book you should read.<br /><br />This book is fantastic. It worms its way into your brain and you find yourself thinking about it at odd moments sometime after you've finished. It's a little slow to start with, it starts to get better after page 53, but don't skip the beginning or you won't understand the story. As you get further into the book you get further and further involved in the lives of the characters that make up the impressive `Le Cirque des Reves'. I was worried that the descriptions were going to become Tolkien-like and take up more of the pages than strictly necessary, but Ms. Morgenstern manages to avoid this. The descriptions, especially of the actual circus, help to bring parts of the story to life.<br /><br />As is gleaned through the story, the circus is the stage for the main characters stories to play out, although it is an important part of the story itself - it is almost a character in it's own right. I was never 100% sure whether the circus itself was malevolent or benevolent. But it is definitely a place that, if it were real, I would want to go to. It's a little spooky, but fills all its visitors with a sense of wonder and awe.<br /><br />That said, if you are expecting a story about clowns, acrobats and strongmen, then I am afraid you are going to be disappointed. There are few things traditional about the Night Circus. If chapters that switch from future to past (although only by a few years) annoy you, then that may put you off this book, but don't let it. The back-and-forthing wasn't terribly confusing (and normally it's something I really dislike.)<br /><br />If you are after a change of pace and have a spare weekend, try this out and see. It's probably not the sort of book I would ordinarily read, but the blurb was very intriguing and I am really glad I did read it, as it has to be one of the most beautiful books I've ever read.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|I have tried to watch 3 times and have fallen asleep each time. Not sure I will ever get back to it.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This is a MUST have for your goPro! It turns the goPro into a fully functional lcd screen camera! And it comes with proper housings for using the touchscreen or not! Great product!
B009CGGDP4|5.0|This version of Peter Pan has good acting and visual effects are cool too. Good for anyone with kids. The kids will love it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's an all round entertaining game but needs to work on the in and out zoom. I do like that in contrast to other games you keep collecting money when your not playing.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Just another amazing album from the guys of vampire weekend each track is amazing but step is my favorite for sure
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Simply put, this is a good back up to have in case something happens to the one that came with my kindle. The quality is good and it seems to charge my kindle efficiently.
B00632HWOG|4.0|It is what I expect from yahoo e-mail , very useful and easy.  I like the layout and the fact that it load so quickly.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I love this show. I had to buy it now that I found the money for it. I can't wait for the movie to come out!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The app is clean, the pics are much better than logging it. I try to use it once a day but it is addictive.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I love this app! I use it all the time. No matter where I am or what I'm doing if I hear a song that I like I will Shazam it and it tells me the song and the artist and asks if I want to buy it.
B009X01FJS|5.0|Great color, nice feel and quality!  Plus I really can flip my Kindle around from landscape to portrait.  I love the landscape for watching movies as it stands as well.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I bought all four seasons at a time for my mom on mothers day. It's one of our favorite shows and we hadn't seen it all. I would recommend.
1623420148|4.0|I really enjoyed Tangled b/c the narrator, our hero Drew, is hilarious, honest, and a bit ridiculous.  He's over the top, in your face, UN-PC, and unapologetic.  Yes he is crass, selfish and immature, but he is also self aware and admits to all his faults.  He owns them.  He is a pig, but a likable pig.  For me, he was actually a lovable pig.  I love when a pig sees the light and changes his piggish ways.  Drew does a damn good grovel, by the way.  One of the best I've read.  A lot of romantic heroes put their heroines through hell and barely have to do anything to earn their HEA.  Drew puts in the effort to prove his love to Kate and it's heartwarming to watch.  I really loved Kate.  It would have been nice to get a little of her perspective, but I understand the author's decision to let Drew tell the story and in the end I think it was a smart move.  Drew is utterly charming and charismatic.  I couldn't help but smile even when he was offensive and inappropriate at times.  He is a 28 year old guy who has been spoiled, coddled and doted on his entire life, he needs to be taught how to behave - and Kate is just the woman to teach him.  She is strong, ambitious, smart, and also kind and witty.  I adored her and love that she stood up to Drew and made him fight to win her back.<br /><br />This is a seriously cute story, I'm looking forward to reading more from Emma Chase.  So what's the reason I deducted a 1/2 star?  Drew's narrative is a bit verbose at times.  Too many analogies and drawn out explanations of things.  While many of these tangents are humorous, many of them are also unnecessary and I found myself skimming them to get back to the point at hand.  But it's a pretty small issue and the book is definitely worth a read.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|This is one of the best shows on television. I can't get enough of Simon Baker as Patrick Jane. He is amazing and the stories keep you guessing. It's fun to follow the cases and try to figure them out. It also has such a great back story of Patrick's. No spoilers. I would recommend.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Great writing and beyond amazing acting in a series that you never know what twist they'll throw at you next!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I love this show! I finally found the money to buy it. This is so amazing. I love every season and would recommend to anyone. Great actors and it's mysterious and funny!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like how it lets you know when you have a new mail. It is very handy while traveling. All of the folders are available.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I at first thought this would be way too easy. And at first it is. It gets tougher as you go. Very addicting! And well worth the price(free).

B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter keeps getting better and better!<br /><br />The only thing that gripes me about this product is that it is advertised as having CC - Closed captions. However they are 'special' captions where your player and TV has special technology to display them. Unfortunately, being in Australia, we don't have this facility.<br /><br />Most other US titles that advertise CC or Subtitles that are switched on/off via the DVD menu.<br /><br />CC are a real bonus for us deaf people!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a super app, because it matches exactly to my Kindle Fire's battery level when you go to &quot;Device&quot;!!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This game is fun and challenging. I gave it only 4 stars because some of the levels can be frustrating even if you know how to beat the level.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|We really enjoyed watching this and I like that comes instantly on my roku.  The price of rental could cheaper.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Nice, Fun App! I Love This Game So Much! :) Very Worth Buying! Thank You! :) cheap deals on coins and fun levels to keep you busy when you're bored! :)
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|Holy cow. I know he cheated on his wife but does every godless dick in Hollywood hate this guy so much that someone wouldn't take him aside and say \\"Arnold, please don't do this.\\" Talk about an ignominious ending.
193700788X|2.0|After years of patiently waiting for each novel, I can not put into words how utterly disappointing this last novel was for me.  In fact, I will not be reading any more of Charlaine Harris' books or novellas because I feel like she cheated her fan base with the last and final farewell.  Some might surmise it was who Sookie ended up with at the finale that may have evoked such a strong reaction.  I emphatically exclaim, &#34;Not at all!&#34;  I actually felt Charlaine Harris' boredom and lack of interested in the book from the beginning.  It seemed that she was tired of the series and just wanted it to end.  This is such a slight to the fans who have been following Sookie throughout the years.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I thank it is a good game for kids like me.I love the show.I watch it every day on my kindle fire.There is lots of Buldings and Ponys get.It is fun!!!!!.So I'm going to give it five stars.Get this app!!!!  :-)
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I love all the cut the rope games...there's really nothing else that need be said. At least as good as the original.<br />Note: Just be sure not to buy the in-app superpowers or whatever. It's not worth it. Playing it through normally makes it more challenging/fun and cost less.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|If the basic premise of this film--and/or several opportunities to see Helen Hunt in the altogether--interests you, THE SESSIONS should prove worth your while. There's relatively little here that's LOL funny, but the whole lighthearted tone of the film effectively conveys some serious musings on happiness and fulfillment, religion, guilt, and numerous other things. THE SESSIONS also treats the libido in general (and the male one in particular) objectively and compassionately, as well as responding to the question, \\"Exactly how important should sex be to us?\\" Some of the ideas are not entirely fleshed-out (no pun intended), but the film goes just deep enough in the areas mentioned.<br /><br />Other considerations:<br /><br />--Excellent acting--by the supporting cast as well as Hunt and Hawkes--with ultra-realistic dialogue;<br /><br />--The irony of Mark (Hawkes) confessing and seeking advice from a presumably celibate priest is not lost;<br /><br />--Just knowing that this film is at least loosely based on a true story greatly enhances it;<br /><br />--The ending could not be any better.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Good quality, my first Nicholas Sparks movie I have seen. Enjoyable to watch on a rainy night as a chick flick.

B00AGKHEUI|2.0|Good morning, I bought this CD set as a replacement for a CD that I purchased for my father because he didn't like the jazz CD I picked for him initially.  He enjoyed the 2 other CD's from Amazon but one of the CD's in this set skips.  Because I already sent back the orginial CD (jazz one), and ordered these 3 I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning this one as well.  But he did like the other CD's.  Thank you for listening!

B008MWBY6W|2.0|OK, I could have maybe given in three stars. I bought it based on some of the other, detailed reviews that highlighted how well built it is. I don't disagree with them. The case is well built, and it's large enough to pack a fair bit of equipment around.<br /><br />My beef with the case is how it hangs on my back. The shoulder strap is mounted to the MIDDLE of the case, so the shoulder strap had the tendency to pull the top corner of the bag itself into my back or side. The straps should be anchored to the case where the case would contact my body, so that the case won't jump around on me. I only wore the case for about two hours, but I could tell that I was getting annoyed with how it rested on my back -- it just never seemed to sit right.<br /><br />If it \\"fit\\" better, I would have totally would have kept it. But as the saying goes, when trying on a bag/backpack, it's \\"fit, then function, then form\\" that should be used when trying to decide to buy something you might have on for hours on end.
B00006G8K0|5.0|The first and far away the best Dracula movie that Hammer films made.<br />Lee is superb as Dracula. He should have been given considerably more screen time.<br />If you like vampire movies, this is a must see film.

B007N85POS|4.0|I enjoy this game just as much as the other Angry Birds apps.  It has a lot of challenges and I like it.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Ordered this for my husband and he loved it.  It has great music and was definitely worth the price.  We saw the musical and it was fabulous
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Love the music and great intence scenes.  Great flick.  You will have a tear and renewed faith in the human race.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|Just ordered this from the British and it came to just over $16 in U.S. currency.  I always check the prices there on Blu-ray before buying here.  Sometimes it is less.  Just make sure any discs you order abroad either say Region 1, All Regions or Region Free if you want to play them on our players.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Absolutely worth downloading. Starts off a little slow but super fun once you get past the tutorial. Try not to evolve the dinosaurs until after you've progressed in the game.
B00BCX2F66|1.0|Good for a week and that's it!!! breaks down and craps out soon.. looks cool and functions cool for a week only
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|The album is a great continuation and maturing of what came in the movie before it, but the album, unsurprisingly, is incomplete. The track where \\"Jon Harrison\\" warps back to Kronos is missing, a bit disappointing since it is the first strong and unfettered statement of his theme in the film. The other big one is the version of Spock's theme that plays when he is on the landing shuttle with Uhura and Kirk, just talking to his friends. It was a moving scene in the film, and it would've been a great statement of his theme to have on the album before it played again in other tracks, such as \\"Buying the Space Farm\\" and \\"San Fran Hustle\\". This album would easily be five stars with just a couple more statements of \\"Harrison's\\" theme and Spock's theme. But, of course, it's great music, and if you liked the first album, buy this one!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I have enjoyed every season of this show. Its a guilty pleasure of mine because its fun, and offers a nice escape from the the day to day.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This is a cute romantic comedy with Jennifer Lopez and Cameron Diaz. J-Lo is just what you'd expect.  For never being pregnant,Cameron Diaz surprised me with great acting. Dennis Quad cracked me up! Great cast. If you've had a baby, you'll laugh/cry thinking of your pregnancy.
4789009637|5.0|I brought this in 2010 after finally deciding to purchase some form of Japanese language learning material. Sad to find out months later that there's a second edition lol. I'm just happy the intermediate books I purchased were already updated.<br /><br />I use Genki to teach Japanese to a few of my friends as I learn along myself. It's a great refresher course. Very Simple and basic. It may be out dated but it still helps you a lot.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game. I was looking for a game similiar to D3&hellip;and I have finally found one. The only thing that is bad is the lives that you have. There's so many of these games nowadays that you have to buy the gems and I cant afford to buy them so I have to wait. The best thing about this game is that it was free.

B0047VSW30|3.0|It wasn't what I expected. I had hoped for more action and a better story line.  So be it, can't have everything all the time
B008458O3S|5.0|They're right: It's easy to learn but tough to master. You think you've got it sussed, but then the game shows you who's running things. But keeping at it--and figuring out the right combinations of track and the precise order for them--is immensely satisfying. One tip (from someone who's in the expert mode of this game (having completed Trainyard Express and earned enough coins so as to get Trainyard free), use up as much track as possible, especially on the really easy, direct puzzles. You earn more that way!
B000SW2F6M|5.0|This was everything I hoped it would be, action, love, J. Irons and the story was thrilling. In the end the good guys got the girl and the satisfaction of knowing they had won!!!  What's not to like
B002XXPNXG|5.0|I thought the acting was superb as was the writing . These two have such ease around each other. You should watch the first two and then the third in the movies.

B003INJETO|4.0|For some reason I actually got \\"Road Salt Two\\" prior to getting this one, so I came at the whole concept backwards.  The two albums form a singular story as sung and written by the multi-talented Daniel Gildenlow.  Fans of Pain Of Salvation are all over the place in their reviews of this one.  Some love it, some hate it, and most are somewhere in between.  This is certainly a different direction for the band with very little metal to be found and a lot more emphasis on blues, drama, and 70's style production.  Hints of this had already come through on their two previous albums, but this one goes full force away from metal and into more melodic territory.  Unless fans are willing to move on with the band, they are probably going to be disappointed.  For me, I had to give this album quite a few good listens, but it eventually won me over.  Is it as good as early Pain Of Salvation?  Hard to say as it is like comparing apples to oranges the material is so different.  Personally I like this one a lot, and feel that Gildenlow has made an emotional statement that is quite effective.  Having purchased \\"Road Salt II\\" first, I think the two albums make nice companion pieces to each other and are about equal in quality.  The fact that reaction to this album are all over the map should not be surprising considering the risks the band have taken with this release.
B008L5G4I8|5.0|Somewhere along the way I had read this book but it was nice to re-read it again. I have always been an admirer of Agatha Christie's writing. She knows how to make a mystery twist and turn. Guessing who is guilty is always a challenge.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|I hate this app! The ONLY reason I hate it is because it keeps on telling me to remove apps then I delete about twenty! Then I try again. Still tells me that! I delete more. Still tells me to remove apps! I remove more apps. Still tells me that! It will go on and on until you have one more app.  The reason I like it is because I played it at my friends house and I loved it!

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Yes, this is a match-3 game. Yes, there are tons of match-3 games out there. Lucky for the player (and for the developer since \\"just another match-3\\" game would, in a just world, be a ticket to \\"below two stars\\" land) this has enough different things going on to make it worthwhile. First, the fact that the player has to respond to what's happening to the running guy means you can't mindlessly match: you need a strategy at any given time and that strategy will change repeatedly. Second, it's fast. There's no way around it: pausing to look at the board for five seconds might just kill you. This is not a friendly game that wants you to succeed. Third, the RPG elements. Sure, in a sense they're tacked on to more or less everything nowadays, but in this case they give the irrational part of your brain something to work with, tempering the unfriendliness. You get your upgrades, complete missions, go to different levels...and feel like you've accomplished more than you really have. Sure, you're getting better at the game. You ARE progressing. Progress often comes slowly, though, so those upgrades make each little skill increase seem much larger than it is, keeping the player from ever feeling truly defeated. Putting all of this together we get possibly the most interesting match-3 game since Tidalis, so any fan of fast-paced puzzlers should consider the two bucks money well spent.<br /><br />*edit* People seem to think that it's over when you reach the score mentioned in the title. On the contrary, this game goes by the old-school perspective of score attack being its own end after all the upgrades are obtained. Want something else to do? My best is over 31,900,000 right now. Try beating that instead!
B000I0QKDS|5.0|This cd was a great list of music and rod stewart was great in the singing part and jeff was fantastic in playing guitar with a lot of other good people in the band.
B000QCQ9O8|3.0|Different characters narrate the book and some are more enjoyable to read than others. The conclusion of the book was kind of a let down. I feel indifferent about this book.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley has conceived a far realer Arthur and company than the designation of fantasy conveys. One feels as if transported to the Britain of long ago.
B00122HT04|2.0|Sounds like all the other non-distinguished rock/metal/alternative music out there now.  Music that will have no barring or impact on the society and that will be quickly forgotten.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I'd seen the live performance of this show twice over time and didn't see the movie when it was released.  The film is WONDERFUL and I love having the music/movie handy.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved the way the central theme of Pari and Abdullah's childhood separation is woven throughout the lives and experiences of so many other interesting and complex characters over time that is not necessarily chronological. Sometimes the writing became laborious and wordy, but it is saved by a sense of poetic telling which to me speaks of the author's style. Sometimes just as I had fallen in love with a character the story was off to someone else and I found myself wanting more. I felt as if the ending left me hanging. The story just seemed to stop.
0810994739|4.0|My daughter loves it. We are buying the whole series for her. This is definitely a must  for all kids.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Very cool sound track. Defintely reflects the new artists that are trying to get big in Nashville.  You can tell they need work but still very cool
B007N8RULO|4.0|Tis is a fine product that I would recommend to anyone interested in Playin Solitaire!<br />It works like any good software should!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very pleased with this app. Saves me from guessing how much power I have to do what I want or need to do.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I knew going in that this was the last book in the series, but I still felt like more could've been done with it.  I was saddened that there wasn't more resolution between Sookie and Bill and Sookie and Eric.  They were both such an integral part of the original storyline, but they were given a backseat in this book.  Definitely a book worth reading if you have followed the series all along though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I loved this app so much I bought all three versions of<br />the game it is the best game ever!!!
B003UGLCIA|5.0|i love this movie! still awesome even in this day and age!! a total must watch!! can never beat an original!
B00992CF6W|5.0|butt llama potato pineapple this is sparta your moms name is john your ducks name is phil and your dog is a lizard
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Fun to watch, I'd recommend it for about anyone 13 and under.  Plot is predictable, no real twists. However, it's all done well enough to be enjoyable for a pair of adults.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It was a great game and also a fun game I gotta get more coins to get a new person in this game because I want a person and makeover color car but I really really want a person so I gotta do it over and over but I really really love the game

B008673ZAQ|5.0|The story line made more sense but the sensuality was not lost in it. Characters are very well written in this trilogy..can't wait for the third one to come out!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Love this having all movies in one pack. We just finished watching the first movie and it was perfect. Go Hastings is my most favorite site to buy from. I am never disappointed.
B0026SFEW8|5.0|I watched this growing up and loved it. I was glad to see my teen children loving it as well. The quality was great.
1616550414|5.0|Originally got this for my daughter at the library.  She loved it so much that she requested it.  An excellent book for any Zelda fan.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|In the same vein as Downton Abbey, but more urban and less countryside. There are many of the same type of characters in this series.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I read the book years ago and totally enjoyed the movie and now I can listen to the music, very moving!
B009NY43NY|3.0|It was good to read how it all ends. If you read all the other books then you want to know the ending right? Spoiler Alert - I would have liked one last encounter with Eric, I was surprised that things ended so early in the book between  him and Sookie.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this story!! At one point I was so caught up I actually had to put it down and walk away. I wanted to smack Drew in the face and give his sister a high five!!! I picked it back up and growled at my kids if they wanted something. That readers is saying something.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is a well written book with loads of things for the reader to delve into trying to understand the twist and turns. However the last twist ends up on a dead end road. I expected much more.
B004XISI4A|4.0|A relief to get back to the favorites in this one, but gosh knows how it will end (I hope the author does)!
B000XUBFE2|2.0|This review, plus many more, can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm [...].<br /><br />My Thoughts: This book has been on my radar for a long time but I just never got around to reading it.  I'd heard nothing but high praise for it so when I saw it for sale at a second-hand shop I snatched it up (and may have even cackled with glee at my good fortune for finding a highly touted book for a mere 3 bucks).  First of all, why had someone given away such a gem?  And secondly, why hadn't someone else snatched up this find?!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I learned why.  Apparently the first owner and I have similar views of the book.  I tried to like this book.  I really did, but unfortunately this is one of those books, for me anyway, that didn't match the hype surrounding it.  Curse you HYPE!!!<br /><br />Was the book horrible?  No.<br /><br />Did I find it riveting and fully describing the emotion and circumstances of the era?  No.<br /><br />Will it stay with me?  Not in the slightest.<br /><br />I realize that I'm in the minority with my negative review and that puzzles me.  I just don't understand why this book got such high praises from so many people.  Maybe it's because WWII is one of my favourite eras to read about that I'm so particular about how it's portrayed?  WWI was such a ruthless, raw and emotional time that brought out the best and worst in people.  I don't think that this book did the era justice.<br /><br />After reading books like \\"Stones From the River\\" by Ursula Hegi, \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" , \\"Sarah's Key\\" and especially \\"In My Hands: Memories of a Holocaust Rescuer\\" I found this book to be dispassionate, lacking complex characters and, frankly, generally underwhelming.<br /><br />The characters are lifeless and almost boring one-dimensional characters.  From Liesel's 'good as gold' adoptive father to her consistently sour and crotchety adoptive mother who constantly berates Liesel by calling her a 'saumensch' -- a female pig -- (which got old quickly) everyone seemed to be a clich&eacute;.  People were either 'good' or 'bad'.  Plus, no back story was given about the characters so I never felt emotional invested in any of them.<br /><br />The one character who stood out for me right away was the narrator (I won't share who he is but it was a unique take on narration).  Unfortunately the narrator began to disrupt the flow of the storyline and ended up getting in the way more often than not.  And what's with all the foreshadowing that he gives to reader?  I don't like being told what will happen!  I found that odd and very anticlimactic.<br /><br />Also, because the story isn't narrated by the main character, Liesel, the reader never gets a chance to see things from her point of view.  It's always how the narrator sees things happening and the reader being told what's happening instead of experiencing it through the character.  This caused the characters to feel very flat and lifeless.<br /><br />While the ending was touching and emotional the rest of the book didn't resonate with me.  The writing was good but that cannot make up for the plodding plot or lackluster characters.  Unfortunately I ended up forcing myself to finish the book.  Not a good sign.<br /><br />Not recommended.<br /><br />My Rating: 2.5/5 starse either 'good' or 'bad'.

B00BMR5HOO|1.0|Terrible app. Would not download no matter what I did, so  totally found it to be a total waste of my time.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|As a long-time Edgar Rice Burroughs fan, I was filled with anxious anticipation for the viewing of \\"John Carter.\\"  Alas, I was a bit disappointed.  I loved the special effects but thought that the depiction of the main characters was flawed.  I also sensed that the story had been modified.  So, I ordered and reread the Martian series on my iPad.  (FYI, I still have the paperback copies which I purchased in the early 1960s.)  I then watched the movie again.  I still enjoyed it but wished that the film had remained more true to the original story.  I regret that it appears there will not be a sequel.
B009R659L8|5.0|l didn't want to put this down, finding myself reading all night.  Her books keep me guessing until the very end, and l am always surprised at who &#34;dunnit&#34;.  l would love to see more books from her daughter.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|After seeing \\"Star Trek into Darkness,\\" I realized that I had not viewed the 2009 \\"Star Trek\\" and took action to correct the situation.  As a long time Star Trek fan, I thoroughly enjoyed the 2009 \\"Star Trek\\" and felt that the characters were superbly cast, but I have a few criticisms.  James Kirk was portrayed as too much of a rebel, hotdog, and hothead type figure.  The way he provoked Spock into attacking him was just over the top.  Although I was okay with Spock displaying emotion, his openly kissing Uhura just before he was beamed onto Nero's ship was too much.<br />At any rate, I am joyous that Star Trek has returned and look forward to watching more episodes.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Great acting. This is one of the few movies that I will buy to watch again and again. Watch it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like having this available for quick tabulating. It's easy to use and clearly displays your calculations. Oh...and it's free!
B000WPAG1Q|5.0|Everybody has certain tastes in music. I am a professional musician (drummer), and drum teacher. Christina, simply said, has a god given talent through a set of vocal pipes that can keep me at the edge of my seat. Her voice is amazing, her audience appeal is stupendous no matter if told to do so by her producer, or her honest appeal of thanks to those of us that support her talent.<br /><br />I love every song, every move, every note in her voice.....this concert is wonderful, and full of her older stuff which (for me), is better than some of her newer stuff.  If you have surround sound and a nice couch, you can't go wrong.  As a professional musician, it doesn't get much better!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I bought this book some weeks ago and I didn't want to review it until I have tried the plans that Mike (the author) suggest in it. I thought it would take me some months to do it, but the first two weeks were spectacular. Actually, from day one I loved it as I went from training 4 hours + a day to just one hour a day. Everything changed in my life, but results came very quickly too. I've been lifting for almost three years now, and I have trained all my life, from basketball, soccer to ice hockey and gymnastics, I've played almost everything, so I'm an experienced sports guy. As Mike puts it: this is the book I wished I had when I started training. I would have saved so much money, pain and I could have enjoyed so much everything I did... If you have decided to change your lifestyle, this is where you want to start. If you are an experienced guy but want to enjoy again your training, this is the book you are looking for.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I loooved this book. I laughed loud on subway! It's a easygoing book to put some fun in your life. And you really get curious! I loved the main character personality too.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Enjoy all of Ken Follett's books.  This book kept my interest.  I would recommend this to all my friends.  Very good.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Yes, its not Carl Sagan's book.  But it is what it is and that is a good film.  I find McConaughey to be irritating in any movie - guy is just too full of himself- but aside from him, this was fun to watch. Beside a plot that twists in fun directions, it brings up thoughtful ideas.  I tend not to watch films more than once, but this film was good to watch again after not too long.  Check it out, and think for a bit about the world beyond.  Think most everything is aleady known?  Well,just look up.  Greatest mystery ever is just above our heads- everyday.  No one can say what is above us- even those that think they know, really don't know.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Just when listening to all of the self-destructive forces that are out there in the 'everyday', this story tells us what we are all capable of being.<br /><br />This is such a remarkable story and yet another example of 'The Greatest Generation' and how they earned that reference.  I read this book during Memorial Day and I couldn't put it down.  It was so encouraging and such a shining example of the human spirit at its very best on so many levels.
B00AG297GK|2.0|I get what he was trying to do but the whole structure was just a mish mosh of toilet humor
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Kids love to play and try to get bet score,they play each other for the high score. Great way to pass time.
B001EN71CW|5.0|My husband loves this show and wanted me to see it... Actually he just wanted to own it. :-) good quality with no problems with the disks.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This was a really fun read. Brandon Sanderson has learned from finishing the wheel of time series and hopefully this series runs as long as that one did. The magic system is new and interesting and the characters really draw you in.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|After reading other reviews, I thought I would be dissapointed.  But this one kept me interested from start to finish!
B000HKYBXA|5.0|I watched it with the kids with the closed captioning on--made a huge difference for me. Loved it. Highly recommeneded.
B00B7XGFO4|3.0|The book was so much more emotionally inspiring.  I thought there were way too many important parts changed or omited.  While you cannot get the whole book in the movie, this fell way short of my expectations.  I know the book is always better, but too much missing and Jane wasn't as portraited in the book.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Heroes of Olympus: The Son of Neptune is the second installment of the Heroes of Olympus series. It picks up where the first book left off, and it immediately brings the reader into a world filled with magic and mythology. Not only does this book contain elements of Greek mythology, but it incorporates Roman mythology heavily. By comparing and contrasting the two in a lighthearted adventure, the author effectively weaves themes of personal identity, self-acceptance, ancestral knowledge, and acceptance of the unknown into a captivating adventure that is suitable for all ages.<br /><br />TL;DR - Easy read aimed toward young audience but suitable for anyone. Roman and Greek mythology intermixed.
030758836X|4.0|I'm glad I was able to obtain the Kindle version from my local library; otherwise I would have been upset if I had actually paid for the book.  I'm just hoping that there will be a sequel! Amazing Amy deserves her day in court and Nick a shot at happiness.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|Great series. Anime on Blue Ray is awesome! I highly suggest this series as it is one of the best to have come out in recent years.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|this is by far one of his best efforts.  in the usual dark and toned realm that his music comes from, this one is highly about relationship stuff and it does not disappoint in the least...
B00992CF6W|5.0|When is the update coming out for kindle fire?<br /> And whats in the update?otherwise I give the game a 5 stars
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Our whole family enjoyed this movie! We have already watched the movie in its entirety twice! Great cast and effects.
B002AWX6UM|4.0|A well told story of a young man's life. You pray for change with the author. I appreciated the honest thoughts from the author and his sincerity. I hope that he is doing well and is successful.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If in the beginning this book seems a little strange stick with it. Makes one think about what life is all about and what better way then through the eyes of a dog
B0002DB52M|5.0|The viewers know but do not realize the uneasiness within that slowly increases as things go bad is driven of seeming intent.  That minimalist no-wall views makes the viewer take on the unusual role of an all seeing eye.  This role is not shared by the movie's characters though there are no walls.  What is there to see?  The unrelenting evil in the hearts of men and women, and yes children too but the uneasiness of the movie set's doing is well in place and the heroine's lack of personality and motives leave the viewer hanging until...  ...once again, as at the beginning the dog howls.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|It arrived on time/fast.  No problems at all with this CD.  If you're a 80's Cinderella lover, this is a must to have.  He also puts on a great concert.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|The only bad thing about this album is I saw him live in February and had to wait 2+ months for the album to come out...LOL<br /><br />But seriously...what a fantastic offering.  Of course it's got a taste of everything you like about Cinderella back in the day, but it's got Tom's more bluesy feel to it.<br /><br />It starts out just rocking with Solid Ground.  The riffs make you want to just grit your teeth.  Then Tom hits the high notes on A Different Light.  There's a nice mix of up tempo and a few slow down songs.<br /><br />The Flower Song & Ask Me Yesterday are great tunes.  But my favorite has to Cold Day In Hell.  Lyrically just a fantastic song that rocks.<br /><br />It's pretty simple...if you like the raspy/blues voice of Keifer with Cinderella you will not be disappointed in this album.
B005ELZMF8|5.0|Great album ,,all songs are great, plays and sounds great, good price too....very happy with this product....once again Thank you very much.....<br /><br />Richard
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book was a much better read than I was expecting. All that the people went through as pilots was wonderful to read and learn about. Don't envy that time period, but enjoy learning from it. Fantastic book!!!

B002SF9YNO|5.0|Great acting, good character development, interesting story.  Highly recommended!  English subtitles are easy to read and the story moves at a comfortable pace.  It's supposed to be a story about death (and in some ways it is), but more than that it is a story about life, love and living.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|got for my g .daughter to help with home work and to learn Spanish it make it easy for her
B003G4W49C|5.0|Recommended this by a friend whom wanted to make sure I read it before it was ruined by the movie :) I started on a plane departing from LAX at 4pm EST, and finished a 230AM, BACK at my apartment in Brooklyn. Fantastic read. Great story a quickie for a long plane ride or weekend at  the beach... but a better story than any tv show right now.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Good game but controls are stiffly but otherwise Good game. Is a must play<br />Great story and other stuff like that
B008YKGQR4|3.0|The only real problem I found is that it will not let you share a page to a group like it does on a pc. When you click on the share tab, it will only allow you to share to your own page. That Sucks.
B004UHL9EK|2.0|When it works, it's great! When it doesn't (about every fourth use), it's a royal pain. The notification screen will disappear, preventing you from snoozing or disabling the alarm. That one requires a battery disassembly. Or, you'll dismiss the alarm and everything appears fine, but the app has secretly restarted the countdown, and the alarm goes off again and again. Not looking for these fun surprises, just want reliability. Uninstall.
B0052OZJQO|2.0|The songs i loved and thought would be on it, are not. Taken out of context (i.e. no accompanying video), most of  the songs are often annoying and meaningless. Even before finishing listening to it, i knew that if i could return it i would. A huge disappointment. Felt like a rip off.

B00AKKTDJY|4.0|It's fun and a nice diversion.  The kids love it and it's not vilent.  The only problem is that time flies by when your playing and you can waste a lot of it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this book and can't wait to read the next.<br />  The characters are extremely well developed. You can't help but become engrossed in their stories.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Have this app for iPhone. I can't view everything (especially newsfeed for Pages) easily, and when (IF) I post from the phone app, I can't SHARE to another Page - really weird!

055338466X|3.0|Stephen Hawking tries to revitalize the argument of \\"what is reality\\" using science instead of philosophy.<br /><br />There is a significant portion of this book dedicated to explaining how the universe could exist without a creator. I don't think it's an effective approach. Hawking, for example, writes about how particles can appear out of nothing, so two particles could have appeared from nothing, collided, and created the big bang. Well, it's backed up enough by data that has been observed to follow that logic, but then one must wonder: \\"Where did the particles come from?\\" Or where do the laws of nature that allow for this spontaneous creation from nothingness come from? All Hawking does is present answers that can be further questioned, which means it's impossible to rule out a creator. Now I'm not a religious person, so this point of view isn't slanted by religious bias.<br /><br />Even with the main purpose of the text a misfire, there are some interesting ideas explored in this book, presented in a way a non-scientist (like myself) can mostly understand. This book is not as easy to read as Hawking's \\"Brief History of Time\\" and includes a number of chapters that non-scientists may find difficult. Overall, it is reasonably accessible to a larger audience.<br /><br />The discussion of \\"what is reality?\\" is probably the best part of the book, beginning with an easy to contemplate perspective on reality to a goldfish. To a goldfish, the world outside the bowl is curved due to the shape of the bowl. The same mathematics we use would not function in a fishbowl. It basically explores the idea that all reality is a construct of human observation, that reality is relative to the observer.<br /><br />A number of other science concepts are discussed, particularly in the field of quantum physics.<br /><br />I rate this book 3/5 stars because it is fairly easy to read with some exceptions, presents some interesting ideas, but completely fails to make any strong argument about whether or not a creator exists, which seems a primary purpose of the text.out whether or not a creator exists, which seems a primary purpose of the text.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Ya know, sometimes a movie just starts slow and gets better. Not this one...it just stayed slow and REALLY confusing. We just hated it.

0307476464|2.0|I have read other books by Murakami and loved them, so was very disappointed when this one failed to live up to the others. The story had some intriguing aspects to it, which is why I gave it two stars.  Unfortunately, the only part that was resolved was the love affair between the two central characters, and that was resolved in the most trite manner imaginable.  I wasn't looking for everything to be tied up in a neat little bow;  ambiguity can make a novel great.  But with this book, Murikami just seemed to run out of steam and ideas, and after hundreds of pages, the book is brought to an abrupt and unimaginative end, leaving most of the plot lines and characters up in the air.<br /><br />The book had other flaws along the way, too.  It was highly repetitive.  (Perhaps a fault of the translators, but if I saw one more person whose lips were described as forming a straight line across his or her face, I would have screamed.)  There were also so many cultural references, it sometimes seemed as if Murikami was more interested this time in demonstrating how well-educated he is than in writing a good story.<br /><br />If this were simply a bad book, I wouldn't have taken the time to write this.  The story started with such great promise, I wanted it to fulfill that promise and it didn't.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a very endearing book. The chapters about the orphanages were incredible to read, but thank goodness it all worked out!  Kept me riveted!
B0057ZAA0S|5.0|The movie is ok and certainly has its own cult following.  How can you argue with the price though.  If you have a Prime Account and get free delivery, this is a no brainer.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Well done and engaging movie.  It is an interesting expose of Franklin county VA during the prohibition years.  I think this is the beginning of the reputation Franklin county enjoys today.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Incredible incisive writing, wonderful bravura acting. As to direction I'm especially impressed with the way the key actors keep control over voices and actions - Matt Czuchry as a prime example.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app has helped me relax at night and enjoy a full 8hours or more. The soothing sounds, which I can customize, are simply amazing!
B00C3MKCIS|4.0|Absolutely terrific album that has seemingly appeared from thin air, the D I M E N S I O N A U T has arrived!<br /><br />Drawing from a variety of influences and sounds and achieving a sound entirely their own (after only one album!), this four-piece provide the listener with 73 minutes of finely-crafted proggy tracks featuring slick production from Simon Collins and Dave \\"Squids\\" Kerzner and mixed by none other than Nick Davis. There's a very modern and contemporary sound to this album that happens to highlight the progginess of the music beautifully. All members get writing credits here, preventing the album from having that one-dimensional feel that can happen with bands that have one dominant leader, although it's worth noting that only Collins and Kerzner are credited on every track. A very successful partnership these two have, both in writing and playing (and co-production). The two worked together memorably on Simon's solo record \\"U-Catastrophe\\", most notably on the drum-based track \\"The Big Bang\\" featuring Simon AND Phil on drums. But here, we see much more of an equal partnership. Kerzner is a highly melodic and gifted keyboard player (I suppose that's why made his way onto Steve Hackett's recent Genesis Revisited II project) with a good ear for what works in the song. And Collins has a thunderous approach to his drumming that may remind you of someone with half of the same name. But make no mistake - this is a functioning *band*, and it shows. Everyone makes their own important contributions.<br /><br />Following a short, dreamy intro with a somewhat Jon Anderson lyrical approach, the listener is treated to \\"Cosmic Distance Ladder\\", a track that could have come from one of the better Porcupine Tree albums. The album has taken flight, and we're in for a hell of a ride.<br /><br />\\"Pale Blue Dot\\" has an infectious hook that will stick around in your head for days. Hannah Stobart provides lovely vocals on \\"Beyond Illumination\\", and the piano-based \\"Realm OfIn-Organic Beings\\" may even remind some of Pink Floyd's \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\"!<br /><br />\\"Remote View\\" is a fantastic track, one of many on the album that is impossible not to sing along to - Collins has great pipes courtesy of his bloodline and is equally capable of sweetly crooning or really belting out those choruses. This one carries a bit of a \\"Dear Prudence\\" vibe at times.<br /><br />\\"Not Coming Down\\" and \\"Closer To You\\" are still two more winners that will quickly earworm their way into your head. Very easy to sing along to after only a couple of listens - but these are not simple tracks. There's a lot going on on this album. Although several of these tracks could (or at least SHOULD) get radio play, they have enough of a technical approach to maintain interest from the average prog fan also. There may be hooks and singalong choruses (perhaps in a Spocks Beard sort of way), but there's so much more.<br /><br />And the real centerpiece of the album for most prog fans will certainly be the excellent closing epic \\"Möbius Slip\\". I just love this track, with its atmospheric and engaging intro, all the way through it's different sections for the duration of its almost twenty minutes. The band saves the best for last and fires on all cylinders here.<br /><br />Overall, a very accomplished debut release from this promising band. I had the pleasure of seeing them open for Marillion in Montreal, performing this material live for the first time, and it was excellent then and excellent now. I expect we'll see great things coming their way, and they deserve it - they've put together something special that is certain to be at the top of many prog fans \\"Best of 2013\\" lists. Get the album now so you can see what everyone is soon to be talking about at around the prog water coolers. GREAT job Sound Of Contact! Strongly recommended.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is not a dud. I am a big fan of Percy Jackson. The title said dud but that's not true.
B004P1JEWU|2.0|The short version:<br />So if I discovered LotR when I was a kid, and I found out Tolkien's overarching philosophy was that there were no heroes, I'd be in. If Frodo got ganked at Weathertop, leaving a grim band of misfits to continue on to Rivendell figuring out if any has the strength to bear the ring, that might be a nice plot twist that could weave organically with the storyline. If we saw a different side of orc culture, revealing that nobody is absolute evil, that would add a richer texture.<br />If Elrond barred the gates to the hall, yelled about the ancient grievances owed by the dwarves, and slew half the group, I'd be out.<br />I'm just not interested in semi-relevant downers because somebody thought life is full of semi-relevant downers. Give me relevant ones. I think that's a pillar of my ire.<br />Recommended to anyone who thinks fiction must mirror life, that life is unfair, or who likes watching people suffer.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved every minute of this book.  I was surprised how it caught me off guard up until the very last moment.  Highly recommend this book to anyone.
0143122843|3.0|I found the book entertaining, but the title and cover gave too much away. The author and or publisher should have been more discrete.
B0063IH60K|5.0|always fun to play not always a win use the suggested move or old school it. use your brain to play I do like the auto finish part when your a sure winner
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|The first episode is great. I like that Amazon made it free. It's the one that makes you like or dislike the show. I love the show.
0374533555|3.0|This is an incredibly well written book on the “in depth research” of the operations of the mind as an electromagnetic field of waves impacting the physical living cells within the brain.  Its discussion of the intuitive vs. rational thinking processes serves as a basis for “academics” and those in the “rigors of science” to acknowledge the multiple levels of conscious, sub-conscious and super-conscious thinking that the human species is bombarded with most of which never even produce a “flip” on the green screen of our awareness yet have an incredible influence with how and why we think at levels unbeknownst to the average person.  Although he does not get into the more current “scientific” findings coming from Out of Body and Near Death Experiences, it is a good piece of work at a primary level for one doing any serious research into the cosmic form and nature of communications at work on mankind
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was AMAZING and since I'm so busy with homework and softball, listening to the book on tape was AWESOME.
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|A beautiful modern take with a much deeper mature sweet honey'd feeling that transports you with past Divas like, Ella, Billie, and Sarah,... but yet always lingering in this current 'now' space and time. Simply put, \\"She's  FEELS GOOOD Music!\\"
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Halfway through a two-page description of the history of an inn, I had to stop, close my eyes, and dig my thumb and index finger into the corners of my eyes.  \\"A Feast for Crows\\" continues Martin's masterpiece and his, in my opinion, unparalleled narrative abilities and mastery of character development, but drags out the things I've come to love about his writing to absolutely torturous extents.  Here, he introduces scores of characters with rich histories and spends pages laboring over every microscopic detail of the universe he has created to the point of exhaustion and, worse, his habit of throwing new characters into the mix only to have them vanish, immediately die, or piddle out completely inconsequentially becomes frustrating and ultimately muddles this entry.  The ending brings things together nicely, but you just can't argue that this particular entry couldn't have easily been 300 pages shorter.  One could make the case that Martin is the greatest living fantasy writer, if not the greatest world-crafter who has ever lived, but \\"A Feast for Crows\\" simply doesn't propel the story forward and dawdles for too long with lesser characters, boring locales, and convoluted history.  It never lost me (that is a credit to Martin's mastery) but, boy, did this one come close.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|There isn't much left to say that already hasn't been said about the music, the performance, the presentation... this still gets to me nearly 20 years on, from the days of listening to the CDs incessantly to watching this amazing live show.<br /><br />What I want to stress here is that this is a significant upgrade from the DVD. I was somewhat disappointed with the video quality of the DVD. Very grainy throughout. It looks like they did the best they could with remastering this video and the results are very satisfying. Couple that with DTS Master audio and LPCM 2.0 and this is like a brand new experience all over again. Definitely crank up the DTSHD if your system supports it, otherwise, LPCM is the way to go for any two channel setup.<br /><br />I'm still on my first playthrough as I'm writing this, nearing the end. I couldn't even wait until it was over to write this.
0399159347|5.0|Wow! I rarely give out 5 stars for a novel, it has to be exceptional, and this is.  A difficult review to write without giving too much away. Suffice it to say that the writing is what makes it exceptional. Moriarty develops each character with a skill that has the reader often wondering... what would I do in this case? The way she strings the relationships together make this fiction novel totally believable, and has the reader caring about each character, drawing us in and reading far later than we intended to.<br /><br />We don't always make the the right choices in life. Sometimes not making a choice is a choice in itself. This is a thought-provoking, emotional, and masterfully crafted novel focusing on the complexities of relationships, secrets, forgiveness, trust and love, that will have you thinking about this novel long after you've finished it. The novel also has a couple of back-stories going on as well, it's not all about the husband's secret, but all the pieces are intricately woven, bringing it to a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, I loved the ending (except for the fact that it was indeed ending.) The epilogue was my favorite part, actually. It reinforced a suspicion I had about the \\"secret\\" earlier in the novel, but also gives us a look at everything from other \\"what if\\" perspectives.  I will definitely read more by this Australian author. Highly recommended for book clubs, there is a lot to discuss. Don't miss it. Thanks to Amazon for the opportunity to review the uncorrected proof (advance readers copy) prior to its release.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I never really watched star trek on tv...it was a little before my time. I do love this movie though. I can't wait to see the second one.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Loved the original series, great job to make it about the beginning. They hit it on the head when they cast these actors
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Not as fun as the Angry Birds. I know this is the off shoot of the Angry birds' game but I am not quite the fan of it.
034580404X|5.0|I have to admit I finally started reading these after many friends hounded me..... needless to say I'm glad they did! I couldn't put them down and really found myself smiling and crying with them. Absolutely loved the flirting and how their relationship turns from crush/lust to love!  I'm really hoping for another fifty shades!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|if you want a movie that has some action but a very predictable plot. this is your movie. It isn't the worst movie I have seen, but as far as keeping my attention it did not.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows that i have ever watched and have recommend it to all of my friends, Cant wait for the next season already
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great movie, period.  I'm not a Trekkie but watched the original TV episodes as reruns when I was a kid.  I've also seen a few of the Next Generation episodes.  I've seen many of the older Star Trek movies and enjoyed them.  This newer Star Trek and the most recent one in theaters now, are both awesome!  They breathe new life into the story and the acting, writing, directing, and special effects are all top notch.  Very fun and suspenseful.
B000P6PVLC|5.0|I recommend it.  It captures well the lottery of violence and its consequences in  our modern world.  Good acting.  Bravo.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you might know what happened to her, another aspect of their relationship is revealed and you're once again wondering...where is she?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Greatly enjoy this second season of Downton Abbey...haven't completely finished viewing all the espisodes so I am quite hooked with the plot so far...Great Drama.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Saw the movie first which prompted me to read the book.  Wasn't disappointed and as with most books into movies, the book was so much more enjoyable, although the movie was quite good too.
B005K17RU0|2.0|This version is overkill! I liked the previous one very much. I don&rsquo;t need all the videos and the hourly forecasts. I use to go to the previous one all the time but now I go to The Weather Channel one more than this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Storyline is just as good as the first novel.  I'm now a fan and can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I feel like a big kid playing but all the while it's fun. I'm still trying to understand how to do the battling but hopefully I can manage all quest great game
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|if you thought Criminal Minds was the closest you'd ever get to a &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34; type series, you were wrong. Much darker and far more engaging than any other procedural crime drama on television right now. Hannibal re-imagines characters we've met before in Manhunter or Red Dragon while focusing on the relationship between Hannibal and Special Detective Will Graham. Supposedly they will cover Red Dragon's story in an upcoming season, so KEEP AT IT! So we can see a certain character get glued to a wheelchair and set on fire!<br /><br />DO YOU SEE?!
B00CVCHJ6I|5.0|Dark Tranquillity have always cooked up their own brand of MeloDeath. This album is no different. However, it seems their sound is evolving, in some cases, into a softer sound, and in others, into a heavier sound.<br /><br />The first time I listened to this album I was confused, and almost dissapointed. But the more I listened to it, the more it makes sense.<br /><br />Give it a try if you are tired of cookie-cutter metal bands, or, if you just like good music!
B004LROUW2|5.0|Enjoyed every page... wished it would go on-and-on<br />Very well told, interesting, with a twist<br />Best book I read this year
030758836X|5.0|Everyone I work with was talking about the book so I decided to read it. It was definitely a good read with some unexpected twists and turns along the way.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|The tiles u can choose to create ur noise repeat, i.e storm, rainstorm, thunder, thunderstorm. And u need headphones on for the dream/dreamless stuff.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is just like Mario but insted of fireballs you throw acorns it is free. it crashes once in a while but I'm ok with that GET NOW
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|From the characters, the plot lines to the majestic scenery, GoT has it all!! I highly recommend this show to anyone that love good storytelling and strong characters!
1569242739|5.0|I love Isa & Terry so it's no surprise that I love their cupcake book.  The beginning of the book really lays out the basics of vegan cupcake baking that is great for the novice baker or even the experienced baker who's just new to vegan baking.  They have a great troubleshooting section and then it's on to the cupcakes.  I made their basic vanilla and chocolate cupcakes for a BBQ we had and no one could believe they were vegan, crazy moist and delicious.  They were meant for kids but the parents were stealing them away!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is my favorite show on television. The characters, the stories, the chemistry all make for very enjoyable tv viewing.
B0055N0FZM|5.0|Such a great book! I hope every day that no one will have to live in the fear Anne and her family did because of what they believed in...
B007SGM084|5.0|Definitely read all 3 books.  It's more of a love story than how it is rumored and you will want to see how the whole story unfolds.  Yes there is a lot of sex in the book but its not all s&m.  A lot of the book is very intimate and tender.  There is also a bit of mystery to the books with story lines about Christian's past and other events in the book that keep you interested.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great show, sets up the next one.  You will want to have this movie in your Star Trek collection now.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Great product. It allows me to connect my Samsung Galaxy S III phone to my 1st generation Bose Sound Dock and stream music from Pandora.
159668139X|5.0|Brand new weaver and this book is really helpful - lots of details, clear explanations, and a friendly, encouraging tone. Love it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|They should make a movie of this, it's awesome, add more to it though, get the right people to play the parts
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|It feels like you're listening to Tina Fey talk to her best friend about her life. This book is hilarious, refreshingly candid, and well written. Highly recommend!
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|From the very beginning this movie suffers from extremely poor character development.  I can still remember all of the characters' names in the original 1982 classic movie by John Carpenter starring Kurt Russell. I could hardly remember anyone's names as soon as the action begins. I think the director was obsessed with getting to the monters as soon as possible, and neglected to bring the antarctic crew together in a cohesive manner. The director may have done this on purpose to possibly show that the scientific, academic types are rather boring.<br />In the original movie (1982), Kurt Russell clearly emerges as the true leader amid the chaos of the alien take-over. Kate Lloyd reluctantly emerges as the leader after discovering the cellular structure of the alien creature and its potential for imitating other life forms.  One thing missing from the original movie (1982) is the fact that Kate Lloyd finds the fillings from people's teeth missing when the alien takes over an organism.  This would hace been great to see in the original movie, and would have made it more interesting.<br />I think this movie had the potential for being a great movie if the proper character development and synergy was colated early on, and if Kate Lloyd's character truly grabbed the role of a definite leader, engaged and as lively as Kurt Russell's original character, MaCready.  Some good old American kick-butt, break-the-rules, action was definitely required here.<br />The creature effects were very good, and I found them to be scary.  The director should have turned up the suspence dial a little more.  I did see some segways into the 1982 classic.  For example, the fire axe embedded into the building wall, the two-headed creature lying in the snow with the hole in the building wall, and the radio operator's suicide.  The helicopter arrival at the end of the movie contained some minor ommissions.  For example, Lars' headset did not have the initials on the metal band (B.H.S.) I think. Andthe dog did not look like the one in the original movie. I had to watch this movie since I enjoyed the original one and feel it is a horror classic. The Thing (2011) is not as good as the original, but worth your time to watch it, especially if you did not see the original.  It would make a great horror movie combo to watch both in the proper order.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Decided to join the 21st century crowd (although I still find another social media site to be a bit intrusive and creepy) and I like using Twitter a lot.  It is easy to keep up with breaking news etc.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|I typically have gotten Star Wars and Harry Potter themed sets - which I now realize are geared for kids.  Numbered bags with smaller numbers of pieces.  When I saw this, with its 1334 pieces, I thought it would be harder, but not too hard if it was like all the other Lego sets I've done.  Holy Crap, was I unprepared.  15 unnumbered bags of just tons and tons of pieces.  I was a little overwhelmed at first but just started digging in.  8 hours later and I had the coolest Lego set yet!  It was totally worth it!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Was not happy with ending. Other books in the series were better. Book skipped around, and seemed as if author was in a hurry to finish off series.
B005544V6A|4.0|It was enjoying watching a series about lawyers where there was no violence in the series. The characters are charming, funny and I look forward to the 3rd season. I watched every episode on Amazon.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yes, I really like Yahoo . . . have used it for many years, and will continue to use it for my special purposes.
B004LQGZ7G|5.0|I loved this movie. Gritty, real New York in the 70's. And the chase scenes are by far the best of any Hollywood movie. When you know that they actually took insane risks to have the most realistic effect (which could never be done in a movie today), you really respect the filmmaker for the chances he took at that time to make it the coolest chase scene ever!
B00031TXBI|5.0|Frusciante is an unbelievable creative musician and one of the greatest guitar players I have ever heard.  It's incredible that his work isn't way more popular.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|So this should make for an awkward dinner conversation at the Fresh Prince household. Before getting kicked to the curb at this weekend's box office, M. Night Shyamalan had entertained a notion that AFTER EARTH would be the first in a projected trilogy. He had the same aspiration for AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER. But here's the deja vu train rolling in: the withering reviews, the limp word of mouth, the inflated expectations, the crap end product. Will Smith... oh, damn, man...<br /><br />It's another dystopian future. A thousand years from today, Earth is this abandoned place, long ago rendered uninhabitable by man's greed and obliviousness. Reinterpreting manifest destiny and left with no other recourse, man reached to the stars in a mass exodus; he spread out and colonized. Except that humanity's new settlements have fallen prey to the Ursa, frightening alien monsters that hone in on their victims' fear. A thousand years from today, Cypher Raige (Will Smith) is a Ranger and a living legend, his personal mythos built around his ability to quell his fear, thus rendering him invisible to the Ursa.<br /><br />Cypher's teenaged son, Kitai (Jaden Smith), desperately wants to be a Ranger. He's haunted by the death of his sister at the hands of the Ursa. When the Ranger Corps dismisses Kitai's application, Cypher tries to console his son by bringing him along on a space voyage. In these family bonding moments, no one anticipates an asteroid shower.<br /><br />Torn asunder, the broken spacecraft crashlands on a Class 1 quarantined planet: Earth. It's the most awful sort of homecoming. Terribly injured, Cypher dispatches his son to navigate the treacherous landscapes of Earth and recover the homing beacon located in the shorn tail end of their vessel. There's enough working tech that Cypher is able to remotely track and maintain communications with Kitai. Both learn soon enough that in the millennium that Earth's been left alone, evolution has not had a respite. Now, Kitai's Ranger skills will be put to the tes- oh, wait, that's right...<br /><br />Let's not mince words, AFTER EARTH is a misfire. It's an exercise in tedious plotting and poor pacing and wooden acting. I'm seriously contemplating giving up on Shyamalan. At least Uwe Boll hasn't let me down yet. There is such an unrelentingly somber tone; it weighs the film down. This is primarily a two-man show. Except a concern is settling in me, a passing judgment that maybe Jaden doesn't have the acting chops to carry on the Will Smith brand. With his pops relegated to the backseat, Jaden is asked to shoulder the load. I really don't want to be mean-spirited. I don't want to dis the kid. But he doesn't show me anything. Just tons of furrowed brow action.<br /><br />Should I mention the improbable science? One thousand years is a heck of a long time, but probably not long enough to produce the various mutated species that Kitai comes across. Or just how egregious were man's excesses that millennium ago?<br /><br />I get it that the weird accents were supposed to reflect the gradual shift in linguistics. But the accents just didn't click with me. It didn't help that both Will and Jaden gradually began to slip in and out of their accents. It's like Drew Barrymore from EVER AFTER all over again, only I liked that movie.<br /><br />I think it would've resonated more had Kitai stumbled across a decayed yet familiar landmark or two, just to hammer in that this really is f'ed-up future Earth. I'm not saying the Statue of Liberty half buried in sand or anything. But how about a desiccated Arby's or a really, really old Old Navy? As it is, absent of any ruined signposts to herald a once thriving human civilization, this story could just as well be taking place on an alien planet.<br /><br />The most damning thing of all is that the film fails to maximize its greatest weapon, which is Will Smith. The screenplay, in portraying Cypher Raige as this distant and rigid and monotone super-soldier, dispenses with Will's natural wit and lively personality. By the way, \\"Cypher Raige?\\" For real? That name ticks me off. He might as well have called himself \\"Brock Bacardi\\" or \\"Dirk Destiny.\\"<br /><br />It feels indulgent. It feels like a vanity project. It feels like we're being exposed to an intrusive meta-statement of sorts. There's almost this element of voyeurism, as if we're paying to see the real-life Smiths play out their father-son therapy session on the big screen. It's an impression jarring enough that it kept yanking me out of the story. It may be time to unpin my \\"In Will Smith we trust\\" button, and maybe replace it with the \\"In Uwe Boll we trust\\" button.penses with Will's natural wit and lively personality.

B009SGNMDE|5.0|Actually, its more a 4 1/2 stars. Listened to a few of P Ls cd's since Draconian Times(both draconian times and icon were materpeices) to be honest i was extremely let down. On a whim i decided to check out some  of their newer ones so i started with Tragic Idol.AbsolueTs played retely loved it.Each song is extremely good and i really dont hear any filler tracks on this.This album keeps me interested and it gets played pretty much daily.Love it. Would definately recommend it to a fan.But; if your looking for something to dance to Tragic Idol isnt it.Maybe try One Second or Symbol of Life.
B001C3DKBK|5.0|I am a lifelong fan of the Moody Blues and this album has always been in my top three favorites.  Candles, low lights, and peace.....
B00CW665VI|5.0|Such a refreshing perspective. The wit and humor were perfect and the sex was hot. This book is the whole package. I enjoyed it thourghly.
B008133MDK|5.0|Loved this.  Watched the whole season in two days, I couldn't stop watching.<br />I highly recommend this modern version of the classic.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Martin outdid himself, the writing is fantastic and the story continues to surprise me and bring out a whole range of emotions!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Let's speak about where to place yourself when you are not sure where you belong. This is the first thought that came to mind during and after the movie. Have you seen this movie? We are going to watch it again so we can better understand what we missed. I think this movie will be great a third time around. So much to think about and consider. As far as filmmaking, this one gets 4.5 stars and two thumbs up. As far as story telling, this movie gets 5 stars and two thumbs up. It's a bit long, so there is a lot to take in. I wish we could review 3 times.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Cyndi Lauper proves to her audience that she still wants to have fun with this batch of uplifting and well crafted songs.  And like a chameleon shows us her true colors again by her ability to create quality Broadway show tunes that can very well lead her to a Tony award.  &#34;Sex is in the Heels&#34; is just a drop of her hat full of stars. Shine on Cyndi!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game!  Runs smoothly and its crazy addictive! I was just looking for an app to pass the time and now I find myself playing it all the time.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Could be better, but the price is right.  Its worth checking out<br />The looks are nice, and the movement easy.  But no move list and you must remember what pieces are captured.
B000062XFG|3.0|It had some disks that were very bad. It was strange because the first disk would not allow me to see stories then next one would be very good.the next ones were good then last one was bad.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It has a lot of courses and vehicles and you can up grade the vehicles as you earn points.  The courses are challenging but easy enough to earn points, so you can earn points to upgrade and get over the challenges.  I enjoy playing it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the variations in the different stages, think the clues are too easy but absolutely looking forward to the next one
0307740919|5.0|Ms. Morrison is a very talented writer.  I actually think about the words she writes.  You have to if you want to understand the book.  I love her books but this is the first one I've read in a long time that I understood in the first read. Ms. Morrison's books always have an intriguing storyline that requires me to reread each book, several times.  All the different scenarios make me stop and think about how they are related to the whole of the book.  Eventually it all comes together and I can put it on the shelf with her other books, with the intent to read it again.
B001MKQS4O|4.0|If you want to get a sense of what Truman Capote was actually like, see this movie. The acting is jaw dropping.
B00127RAJY|5.0|If only I could stick to anything for 30 days, I know for sure it would work. I never understood why people say excercise doesnt work. Its the only sure fire way to lose weight in addition to a good diet. You will lose weight it you stick to it.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|This is quite simply a wonderful read.  With all of the magnificent reviews that have come before, it is difficult to come up with anything new to say.  So I will simply say, do yourself a favor.  Buy this book and read it.  You will not regret it.  As an author myself (\\"The Bridge Tender\\" and \\"River of Mist and Light\\"), I am often reminded of Stephen King's simple but brilliant 3-word formula for becoming a writer: read, read, read. If you want to be a writer, or just passionately love books, be sure to include this novel should you choose to follow that formula.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have just started playing.Seems to be a really cool game. Requires some patience.  No trouble understanding it so far.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|It provides me with quick updates of the info on my account and allows me to do simple things to keep my activity up to date. I find some of the functions a little difficult to use but overall the app is very helpful and a useful tool.
B001M0HGR2|1.0|When is a blockbuster movie in HD bad? When played on Amazon Streaming Video during prime movie watching hours ( Friday or Saturday might from 8pm to midnight ).<br /><br />I wanted to draw attention to the failed attempt to stream from Amazon...it just does not stand up to Netflicks and other service providers.<br /><br />I have FiOS 75 mb down with a fiber connection and the new Gig router. My back end uplink exceeds 250 Mbps and QoS is enabled. To further prove my point I get 40 Mbps on my iPhone (and other IOS devices) and can stream 5 channels of video and have 3 set-top boxes running on demand video without degradation of sound or video.<br /><br />Playback device is an up to date Samsung 6 series Smart TV with Media Hub. Yes, using the latest Amazon app. Yes, I tried streaming to varied devices including my core i7 MacBook Air.<br /><br />So in summary: Ironman \\"1\\" in HD is a 5 star hit, to bad I tried to watch it with my fiancée on Amazon, it was her first time seeing it. We finally got to view rest of the movie at 10 am the next morning.<br /><br />...back to the engineers guys.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Excellent story. I can hardly wait for the next one! I enjoyed reading it a lot! I hope the next book is as good as this one!
B0013ND30W|5.0|I am 68 years old and have enjoyed Mr. Disney's work all my life but find the prices that some vendors are  gouging  consumers is ridiculous. I've seen prices as high as $1500.00 for a single collection. Back to sleeping beauty. I  love good animation without computer assistance. If you can find this blu ray for about $25 then go for it.
B004IE9REE|2.0|This is ridiculous. I wanted this in Kindle format rather than as a bulky book to carry with me when shopping or traveling. I can't look up specific perfumes, and I'm not likely to read through the entire book in alphabetical order! I would have bought the hard copy, had I known, but I'm not going to buy it twice. What a waste.<br /><br />ETA: This book could not be searched on my Paperwhite, to my great disappointment, but could be searched when I downloaded it to the Kindle app on my phone.
B0063M22QO|4.0|many hours of entertainment.  I enjoy playing the game.  I wish I could change the images on the tiles. It would be cool to be able to customize the tiles
B003E6LC6I|5.0|This season did not disappoint. A new story with more twists and turns to the very end. I have it on my Kindle Fire so I can watch<br />episodes at my convenience. I found I had to watch one every day! I just love the characters even though I'm always afraid one of my favorites will suddenly disappear due to a unexpected circumstances!<br /><br />You will not regret downloading this season!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I bought this game after I played it for free. I love the hint button if you forget where you need to go it will tell you. Very fun game only complaint wish it was longer and better ending.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think this is a perfect game for children and adults! It increases brain skills and mathematics in a fun game! I would definitely recommend downloading this app because it is awesome!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|There's no hint no sense of direction there's no clue what to do. I wouldn't even like it if it was free.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I was looking for a wireless gaming headset to go with my new ASUS G75VW notebook.<br />I wanted to use it before I reviewed it and after about a month I have to say that it's fantastic.<br />It has wonderful sound and extremely long battery life.<br />It also has very good range. I was surprised to discover that it kept working even after I walked away from the computer and into another room across the house.<br />I'm very happy with this product and its features.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have found many old friends and distant relatives on the site. Gotta love Facebook, brings people together from anywhere.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Its a good app takes a little getting used to its not Google reader, I use it a lot and am getting more used to it.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Enjoyed it!! King gets right down to it and spins a story like one else. A page turner to the end!
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is one of the best seasons. The streaming works great too. I can finally catch up what I missed before season 9.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this when I was a young boy. It impacted me strongly, for many reasons. I picked it up again, now, in middle age, worried that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered. Wouldn't have the same heft and resonance. I was worried that it had become greater over time in my memory -- greater than it really was. I wasn't sure I wanted to risk that re-reading it would expose my wonderful memory as false, and ruin it. I needed have worried. It wasn't as good the second time, but it suffered only in the way that any second reading does by not having the magic of reading something for the first time. My memory was not false. Enders Game is a fantastic, classic read.
159463176X|4.0|I love Khaled Hosseini. His prose his beautiful, his insight into the human condition is remarkable. That said, I'm a tad disappointed with his latest book -- which, may I add, I waited years for! Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a worthwhile read (especially the first third of the book.) But I have to agree with others who were bothered by the jumping around of characters. I had trouble tying them all together; later chapters seem disjointed from the earlier ones. It almost seems like after the first third of the book, you're reading short stories that are interrupted by other short stories. There's a connective thread, but it's not very strong. Still, as usual, Hosseini managed to win my attention from the first to the last sentence. And like his other books, I couldn't put it down.
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|I'm shocked not only at how Great this music is, but that i'm only the 2nd person to review this CD?!!  This woman is in The Big Leagues, up there with Billie, Sarah, Ella, Abbie and only a few others! In fact, when i first heard her on the radio, singing What a Little Moonlight Can Do, i thought it was some recnetly discovered track by Betty Carter!  CHECK OUT THIS VOICE/THIS MUSIC!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was beautiful to look at, entertaining, and unique. It was short but I loved it. It wasn't too hard nor too easy. A recommended game.
0887431453|5.0|It has most of everything that I was looking for, simple puzzle games, opposites, trace shapes/letters, Alphabets, eliminate odds, etc.<br />It is not a heavy book but seems good quality.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I thought that I had a problem with my Kindle HD, but this app reassured me that everything is OK. It is, in a word, brilliant.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|cool easy game and always changing. You'll always be waiting to expand and conquer! This game is exspensive if you want stars though.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I love this song and i play it alot in my car, home and at work. Good quailty from amazon and will continue to buy from them. Love JT alot.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Outstanding. Wish they had run for ten seasons. One of the best futuristic space shows ever. Great cast. Good interaction and couldn't help but smile at times.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This came quickly and the movies play well. Have enjoyed the first two movies and no glitches so far. The price was wonderful.
B000HF2NF8|4.0|I haven't bought this and it looks like a great deal but the original mask is different it has lines around the eyes and more.
B00488SU02|4.0|Great plot twists with shocking ending. Really makes you think about our justice system and the death penalty. Would definitely recommend
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is good old fashioned TV without sex, drugs, OR rock and roll. Cant wait for #2, I love it
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|movie was slightly interesting. boring at times but overall watchable... i am a fan of ryan gosling but this was not his best performance
B009EHDU7U|5.0|I loved this book. It was witty, funny and actually very interesting with all the historical figures woven into the twists of the story. I hope I'm very bit like Allan when I'm 100!!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I pre-ordered the Stereo set back in 2009.  Out of ignorance, I thought Mono was inferior.  After listening to a few of the songs in Mono online, I had to buy the set.  Yes, there are subtle differences on the tracks, you might hear a guitar a little bit louder here and there or maybe the drums hit a little harder.  But some of the songs are entirely different such as in She's Leaving Home.  The Mono set has a sound that seems more \\"raw\\" and primitive, it's really difficult to describe.  A couple of songs that really stand out in Mono are Paperback Writer and Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise) where the drumming really hits hard.  You also get more the intimate feel, like the writings said, in Yer Blues.  It sounds like the Beatles recorded that song in a closet.  Before buying the set, I did some reading and found that the Mono mixes was the way the Beatles envisioned the music being.  Personally, I'm more of a fan of their Revolver and on material but be aware that Let It Be and Abbey Road were done in Stereo so they're no in this set.  I love the Mono set but if you can, I would also get the Stereo set as well.  Despite the fact that they've been disbanded for 40+ years, the Beatles music continues to amaze me.  You're best listening to the digitally remastered discs with a set of good headphones so you can really hear all the sounds.  I think that they were underrated musicians who had incredible chemistry.  Buy this set and buy the Stereo set, too.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|We have this movie at home. Now my 4 year old daughter can watch it on the go! I love my Kindle Fire HD.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This was an excellent book, I read through it in less than a day because it was a captivating book that just kept me reading.  In great detail, he describes the horror that he went through in North Korea.  It is sad that so many in the world do not think that the brutal regime should be changed.  It is also sad that many North Koreans may not even know that the way they live is not normal.  It is disappointing that China continues to provide economic aid to North Korea, basically enabling them to continue the oppression of North Korean citizens.  This book will give you an appreciation of the good lives we live in America.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|It took me awhile to finish the game but it was a lot of fun. It was tricky about half way through until I figured out that activating all the potions was working against me. I could not get the intricate lock activity to complete because one potion was adding a lock to chests.<br />I enjoy match three games and this adds difficulty of having to make certain matches to align with the path in the dungeon.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|LOVE PLAYING IT A+++ GREAT GAME FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO PLAY ..KIDS LOVE IT SO MUCH A MUST HAVE  THANKS AMAZON
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it it is like you have a real horse. you get to feed it and take care of it. you get to compete and everything
B001EO748M|5.0|I really like the time period of Tudors.  I recently did my family tree and found where all of my family was from Europe in many different areas.  Very well done series and the charters are great.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Very disappointed in the close of this series. Contrived, predictable, and ultimately a let down. I expected more of a climax.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I bought this book based upon all the positive reviews it received on amazon. I have to agree with the majority on this one and say this book is fantastic. You truly can change your world by adopting these four agreements, although it won't be easy at first. This book is a quick read and I will be reading it again, it was that good!
B005I6EU48|4.0|This cover looks really nice. My only complaint is that there isn't away to keep the cover closed, but that's not that big of an issue.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I had a hard time deciding on the amount of stars to give this book. Defending Jacob was well written as far as keeping me interested and curious. It was definitely informative and interesting. However I could not connect with the main character/narrator. I thought he was dishonest and immoral. He was so self-involved and self-serving. He seemed to have such a lack of empathy. He was also just very dry. So big turn off for me.<br />So from a standpoint of keeping me interested and not wanting to put the book down, I liked it. But from a character and emotional standpoint, I didn't like it at all.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I was hooked on Sherlock after watching the first episode. It's a very entertaining series, and I highly recommend it.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|One of the best Lego movies yet. I am always amazed at the quality of their movies. My son loved it out course.
B008133MDK|5.0|I really enjoyed season one of Sherlock, and season two lived up to the first. The finale was really emotional, and the acting continues to be superb.
B00CWV8X04|3.0|I'm glad I rented this movie instead of buying it or seeing it in theaters. All in all the movie was pretty good but very slow going and somewhat predictable.
B00280LYIM|3.0|I can appreciate that they are entertaining for kids, but as someone who is a little outside their targeted age-range, I can only say that they're &#34;okay.&#34; The world created in the stories is interesting enough, but the writing isn't great, and the same plot devices are used over and over again. If you're looking for an easy read that doesn't require too much thinking, but is still fairly entertaining, you could do worse than the Percy Jackson series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The books are amazing, the start of good, but keep on getting better and better. I'm on the last one and just purchased the Shift trilogy and pre-ordered Dust. Can't wait for my vacations so I can put a serious dent in those books :)
B008220BLG|5.0|I went and saw Warm Bodies in theaters, first 10 minutes of the movie I said I was buying it. I preordered it a month ago!<br /><br />At first I was a bit skeptical about seeing it, but I'm so glad I did!!! The instant it comes in the mail (tomorrow!) I'm making my whole family sit down and watch it!
B002M9WW30|5.0|This collection of Rocky movies is one of the best I've seen so far. The HD is fantastic and I was very happy with the packing and the quality. Unfortunately, the last three movies were damaged and not playable. I returned the item, but will definitely purchase the collection again at a later time when available.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is my favorite one I have. So much fun!  Both this one and the first one are great!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|So super funny!! Loved it . This is a crazy funny movie that you must watch. Very funny and not boring
B003OPUZYY|5.0|All 5 of the Chrysalis Collection of Ten Year After<br />I really miss Alvin Lee already, this is a good way to remember him
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app ever I play it constantly and enjoy it so much it will be so much better when 0.7.0 comes out
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|The video is a complete history, basically un-abridged of the Eagles history.<br />The great past with Linda Ronstadt etc Incredible Music (showing all the ego's)
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Ok if you like dressing up in fancy clothes and you might want to be a stylist when you grow up this is the game for you! :) GET THIS GAME!
B000SSV8HI|5.0|I lived in Dallas when this show was done in Austin, I really wanted to go,,,<br />so now I can. Great show,great audiio-video
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I actually listened to the audible version of the book while doing other things (things that didn't require much mental engagement) and really enjoyed all four sections of the book. I learned new things from every section fire, water, air, and earth.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|I saw this tour and loved every song.  I am really glad to have this as a great memory.<br />What an incredible collection of great artists who love the legendary Mr Starr
0670014893|5.0|As a lifelong fan of LeCarré I think I've read everything he's ever written or close to it. Agree with many of the other reviewers that this ranks among his best. As always the dialog, the description, the humor, the different British voices are all impeccably drawn. On almost every page there is a bit of writing that only LeCarré could have pulled off and one is tempted to go back and reread just to fully take it all in. He also keeps you off balance - deliberately so - by using flashbacks, flash forwards, esoteric vocabulary, inner thoughts written as dialog, unique sentence constructions, and that is all part of the fun. Oftentimes one is not completely sure who is speaking or who is being referred to but with a little thought or simply by reading on it all becomes clear. I'm sure that this is deliberate and I think just adds to the overall enjoyment.<br /><br />What doesn't work for me - I'm not necessarily buying all the plot twists. If you strip the book down to just the essential plot elements - I remain unconvinced that things could have worked out in just the way he writes them - for example the notion of the \\"Red Telephone\\" - to me just doesn't hold a lot of water. (If you read the book you'll know what I mean by \\"Red Telephone\\" - if not hopefully I haven't given anything away). And there are other examples as well.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the overall book experience is classic LeCarré and we are blessed to have had this brilliant writer and to have had as many books as he has given us over the years.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This video has helped me understand how this country got in such a stupid place financially<br />I am waiting eagerly for his up-date piece
B00957T6X6|5.0|Love the show. The books are half a hundred times greater. Would that the series could continue forever. Here's to hoping that House Targaryen is restored to the Iron Throne, the dragons flourish, and little Arya becomes the greatest assassin EVER!!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can read the kindle facebook so much easier than the one on my computer. I really, really  love it.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I absolutely adored this book and was so sad when it ended I wanted it to go on and on and I was so moved that it has stayed with me for a long time afterward, I actually read a paperback copy then realized it was on e-kindle so purchased it and gave it to my daughter to read also, I have since read three more by Jojo Moyes and will read further written by her.
0307279189|5.0|I'm reading a book per week in 2013, and I picked up Born to Run on the recommendation of a friend for Week 21. I never would have read it on my own.  In the top 5 for the year so far. Absolutely engrossing. Many argue that non-fiction books can't be true \\"page turners\\" that make you want nothing more than to see what comes next. This one is. Having said that, if you read it, try not to take everything at face value. All good stories deserve embellishment.
B00AG471Y8|5.0|When Rick Wakeman rejoined the band on this and Going For The One, it was more than an event, it was two great albums and tours that made these long time memories for the fans.....Worth it for Don't Kill The Whale.....open up cover.....lyrics.....great stuff....
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was such a disturbing novel but written wonderfully well. While it was upsetting, it also was riveting. The ending was a complete shock. Still would recommend it.
B00B89WXI4|5.0|Another stellar album from YES gets the 180 Gram treatment....and on Blue Vinyl with the triple fold out cover....WOW! Check out the keyboard work of Rick Wakeman on his big return to the band in 1977.  Listen to the hit WONDEROUS STORIES!  Worth it just for this track....classic Jon Anderson....saw the band this year.....do the album in its entirety.....very very cool!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Love this game, on my phone, my computer and now my kindle fire. The quality is great and the touch ability, that I don't have on my computer is the best.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best thing about this series is that it doesn't follow the cookie-cutter guide for a TV series. No one is safe. The blend between drama and comedy is very well done. The characters have depth and emotion. You feel for them. The effects are not too realistic but enough to make you squeamish. The action keeps you on the edge of your seat and very involved. You gasp, scream, and cry.
B00CHILW64|3.0|I watched half of this movie on my flight to Florida. When I went to watch the remaining movie coming home I was shocked to see it had been removed. I had no way to finish the movie and thus give it a true rating. I feel ripped off and very disapponted. I'll never download another movie from Amazon. What a waste of my time and money.
1932735410|5.0|I have attended a PMP Boot camp and then i had to decide which material i will be preparing to take the exam.. It was a tough choice between Rita's book and the Project Management Academy's material.. I went with my gut feeling and started doing exercises in Rita's book and filling in the knowledge gaps by reading the book.. Information is very well presented and i passed my exam on 13th May 2013 in the first attempt. I havent really consulted PMBOK guide much..<br /><br />Highlights<br /><br />1. Well organised information and clear explanation of the concepts<br />2. Close to exam question and infact i got some questions verbatim from Rita's book<br /><br />Side note: I didnt really go for Rita's process game as it would interfere with my state of my previous knowledge.. If you reading only Rita's book, then may be its useful, if not dont worry too much about it.. Practice the questions and you will not regret it..<br /><br />All the best.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|the secret life of a sniper and thr traumas they must endure for our contry.  great book well written  a great read of the men and women that keep this great country safe
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is very intriguing. It really puts your brain to work and stimulates your mind. It also requires uninterrupted concentration.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|great to see what happens behind the scenes  we think we are safe and sound at home not knowing what the men and women of the armed services do to keep us that way.  great book and well written
B00AG297GK|3.0|Like most movies today, the previews showed all the funny parts. This movie had its moments, but nothing I would purchase or go out of my way to see.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I am addicted ! Michael C. Hall portrays a serial killer like no one else could.  He has a way to makes you always see him as the good guy / victim . Kudos to the writers and other actors.
B00942G4UA|4.0|This was a very eye opening documentary. I found a new appreciation for my food and where it comes from.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love the detail,  yet the simplicity and ease of moving from one location to another for us travelers. Would like longitude and latitude included.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|I loved Torchwood seasons 1-3 (or as we call it Torchwood UK)<br />A brilliant \\"Monster of the week\\" series, with some interesting side stories as well.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|One of my favorite movies that is out on blue ray. It was a must by for me, and I received the item within 3 days.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Doctor Who,, but never saw Christopher Eccelston's Doctor.  I am glad I saw it. There are memorable and not so Memorable episodes, but it's worth the watch to get caught up with all &#34;new&#34; Who.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|The Tremors movie box set is very good to have! You get all 4 movies on 2 disc in one box set! I love these movies are funny,scary,suspenseful and a super cast in these movies! What do you want in a movies like this! Pick this box set up and being it home with all your dvds!
B00000J7SS|5.0|thank you very much. it's great! I love this product. The person I bought it for will love it too. thank you
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Great fun, wonderful story. My kids watched it again and again. Each time they did watch it, never was there a moment where we felt that it was getting tiring or annoying (like some animated movies can be i.e tinkerbell).
B000UVLK1M|5.0|thank you very much. it's great! I love this product. The person I bought it for will love it too. thank you
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Daughters new favorite movie! An two movies for the price of one when all the other stuff out there is over priced.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|It was a good movie but boring in parts of it. Unexpected ending made it better. Overall I enjoyed this movie.
B008EKMB82|2.0|Ruth Ozeki is marvelously creative, and I wish this book were more readable and less of an obstacle course.<br /><br />The story alternates between a young Japanese woman writing a diary and an older woman who discovers the diary carefully wrapped, washed up on a beach in Vancouver. The recipient is half-Japanese and retains some knowledge of the language which helps her tremendously in piecing together the girl's story which is written in both English and her native tongue.<br /><br />Alas, it is of no help to a general reader. The switching of languages and constant inclusion of culturally relevant but obscure references makes for a myriad of footnotes which constantly break the narrative flow. In a scholarly work, footnotes are a great aid to deep understanding. In a text wholly written in one language, footnotes may be \\"assumed\\" and skipped over. But when one runs into a few Japanese words in the middle of an English sentence, the footnote becomes imperative ... and alas, the narrative flow disappears.<br /><br />The story quickly became too much work, and I quit, so no spoiler here. I have no idea how the story ends, and don't intend to find out.
B00005JM02|5.0|The dvd worked perfectly and the packaging was easy to get into. The kid I got it for, loved it.
B001AOKA3W|1.0|I ordered the standard definition version so avoid freezing and buffering and it still happened too many times. It took 2 hours to watch a 90 minute movie. Not at all satisfied.
B005LAIH2M|1.0|I had such high hopes going into this movie. A Solid cast of actors and no PG rating attached so it was definitely geared towards the adult audience. The opening scene I will admit had me interested as it sets the premise as to the goal evil witches works towards throughout the movie.<br /><br />But the minute I saw one of the evil sycophants that follow Famke Jensen (the villian) around I knew things were going to go down hill. The minute he spewed forth his dialogue, the movie's downhill slide picked up momentum. But when Hansel and Gretel actually CAPTURE this spike-headed idiot (and an evil witch to boot), do they kill him? Nope, just throw him in jail so he can be rescued later...momentum close to reaching terminal velocity for this movie...<br /><br />THEN...SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />The total goal of the evil witches is to create an immunity to fire...for all witches. This would render them pretty much indestructible. Normal weapons are ineffective against the power of their wands so an immunity to fire sounds good, right?<br /><br />Well, the thing that absolutely KILLED this movie is what amounts to a massive plot hole. In the movie's third act, Hansel is given the means to enchant normal weapons with a specially brewed potion. The weapons will bypass a witch's wand. HELLO!!!! Screw fire people, just start giving out this potion to every single town in the area and let the town people kill the witches whenever they come to terrorize them. And THAT right there killed this movie...<br /><br />One other point, in the final battle, Gretel has an AWESOME chain whip (treated with the potion of course). If this weapon had been used throughout the movie, I would have added another star because it's use was awesome in the only scene it is shown.

0545140323|3.0|~2.5/5<br /><br />I tried starting this book a long while ago, and stopped because I didn't like it. I started it again, thinking to at least get through it, and found that what I didn't like about it before didn't bother me, but something else did.<br /><br />At first, I didn't like the writing. I thought it sounded very immature teenager. I didn't think so on my second read. What bothered me the second time, though, was the message being sent.<br /><br />So, Penny gets her heart broken and decides she's done with boys. And then she pushes her friends into joining her in a club that is very anti-boy, named after a Beatles song. At first, some of her friends are wary, but then they get hurt in one way or another by a boy, and so they join. Because, of course, boys are horrible creatures, right? Not even human, really. They're the problem to everything.<br /><br />Okay, so there isn't actually very much boy-hate talk going on. But, while this sounded like it could have turned into a `go girls!' feminist type of book, or even one where the message is that women don't need men and can feel completely whole without them, that message wasn't really pushed, nor did it really even come to a head. The only thing that seemed to last, was that the girls decided that they weren't going to choose boys over their friends anymore. And I don't really think that's quite as powerful or important. I understand that not choosing a boy over your friends is important, but I don't think that's as important to push as not to choose anyone over yourself, which wasn't really even mentioned.<br /><br />And, yea, it really annoyed me the way some of the girls jumped to the conclusion that men are horrible, devil-spawns, to blame for everything. Especially when some of the girls jumped to that conclusion much too quickly. For instance, when one of the girls decides that this boy she likes doesn't like her, without even having a conversation with him, she gives up and joins the club, deciding that boys aren't worth it. And I just didn't understand her reasoning, or believe it, and I thought that it was dumb. A lot of their talk and reasons, to me, were kind of dumb. And kind of pissed me off at times.<br /><br />Also, the club gets very big, and we met a lot of different girls. And I guess we were supposed to actually remember a lot of them, know who they are, get the hints about their personal lives. I didn't. There were too many with too little time shown to them.<br /><br />Then there was the fact that a lot of the boys were complaining, and Penny got in trouble with the principal at one point because of what she was doing, even though it was none of their business. Her mother stuck up for her at that point, though, which was very nicely done.<br /><br />The only reason the rating isn't as low as it could have been, is that I did like the ending. And I liked the boy. Also, I liked Diane, an old friend of Penny's, who starts finding herself after breaking up with her long-time boyfriend. I actually liked Diane and her relationship with everyone, including her old boyfriend, more than I liked Penny.<br /><br />I don't have a whole lot else to say. The feminist part of me just raged a bit at this book. But I liked some of the characters, and I liked the ending. I'm not very eager to read any of Eulbergs' other books, but I might pick one up at some point.<br /><br />[This review is also available on my blog, among many others.]hat boys aren't worth it.

B00CO8D3G4|5.0|\\"That's when it clicked...if I was going to thrive, survive, I had to choose myself...We can no longer afford to rely on others and repeat the same mistakes from our past...every second, you have to choose yourself to succeed.\\"<br /><br />James Altucher's latest work, \\"Choose Yourself\\" is the new textbook for the American Dream. James starts with a healthy dose of American history, discussing how what we thought was the American Dream is, in fact, the American nightmare--a dissolving middle-class with replaceable workers; a consumer-based society giving us just enough to be happy and not rebel.  \\"Your bosses hate you,\\" James says to those of us working hard to achieve this \\"dream.\\" James states that as workers create more and more wealth, jobs go overseas, job security decreases, and we're all lucky to have jobs. He has the graphs to prove it.<br /><br />We're all suffering from \\"postsocietal traumatic stress disorder.\\" Society's changing. The global economy has shifted. We need to be able to make that shift to succeed.<br /><br />What does this mean? It means, James says, that the \\"Choose Yourself\\" era is here. In our parents' time, people worked for The Man and retired with a pension. Today, we will be controlled by layoffs, shifts, restructuring, and be at the whim of the economy and corporations--unless we choose ourselves.<br /><br />\\"We are taught from an early age we are not good enough.\\" This book argues otherwise. We are good enough--we have to use our creativity and entrepreneurship muscles. This stuff works. I know. We are all artists and entrepreneurs. Time to \\"unlearn the imprisonment,\\" as James says. \\"Every time you say 'yes' to something you don't want, your fire goes away.\\"<br /><br />\\"Choose Yourself\\" is easy to read, and gets right to the heart of the things we need to consider about ourselves but don't often do. Get rid of negativity. Generate ideas. Recreate yourself.  Every person is an artist and an entrepreneur, James insists. As someone who spent a considerable amount of time avoiding the \\"e\\" word, I know James is right. Prophetic even.  Every potential entrepreneur must read this book.<br /><br />But it goes further.  I teach. I demand students consider these issues in class. James has now written the text. I will use this book in my classes. Students must live these things--\\"Choose Yourself\\" is the followup to James' book 40 Alternatives to College I've been waiting for--I'm grateful.  This is truly an education book.<br /><br />\\"Choose Yourself\\" teaches on so many levels--it reminds me about fundamentals of creativity, entrepreneurship, and balance. It will teach my students how to be successful, avoiding the pitfalls of permanent low-paying jobs, carrying massive debt, and being replaceable.  It will help you regain the balance and confidence you need to \\"Choose Yourself,\\" choose your destiny, and conquer the world, despite the challenges the 21st century brings.

B0035XVVDY|5.0|This movie makes you feel the same pain as the main character.  When the courts give the suspect more rights than the victims, it makes you see red!  Well thought out storyline and great characters. We most definitely will watch it again.
B006L4MX0Y|4.0|I have read both books, seen both movies and the comparisons stop at they are both about kids killing kids. First off if you truly want to be able to compare them do it based on the books not the movies because, while I like BR the movie, it really can never compare to the book. The book is one of my favorite books ever! Since this is about the movie not the book, here goes. The movie is well done, thought provoking and still gets the point of the book across, no movie can ever touch the book it is based on. It is a touching story about children forced into a situation because their government fears them. You get to be with each kid as they are going through this situation, you get to see their past and their last moments. The story does a good job of making you feel for them, question authority, question allegiances. The hunger games is about a girl who questions authority by accident, she becomes a symbol for a starving society. BR gives everyone a chance to tell their story where as the Hunger games tells one girls story. Both are interesting stories but the comparisons people are making aren't always relevant. Read the books, watch both movies then we can compare. If you are basing it off the movies you aren't getting the whole picture. The books are much more complicated. That being said I do love the movie. I remember the first time I saw it several years ago being in awe of a story that could say so much so quickly.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Loved this book, one of the best I've read in ages. The characters were quirky and charming and the story was unusual and not predictable so it kept me entertained the whole way through the book, wanting to know what happens next. Loved it!
B0059XTU1S|1.0|I'm a huge Tolkien fan and I really wanted to love this movie--but it was truly horrible.  They changed the story so much that Tolkein's original story is all but lost.<br /><br />The charm was squeezed completely out of the book.  The movie is one bad car-chase/battle scene/suspense scene after another (scenes that were never in the book!).  There's no sense of discovery or growth.  Not when badass Bilbo kills a warg in the first installment of the series, and Gollum is played for laughs. Sheesh.<br /><br />I could go on and on about what I hated about this movie, but suffice it to say that my family and I were angry the entire time the movie played.  Things just kept making us mad--we felt personally insulted by all the crap thrown into this movie that just didn't belong.<br /><br />Peter Jackson clearly doesn't understand or respect the characters--but boy does he love those battle scenes!<br /><br />Ugh.<br /><br />Bad music.<br />Bad editing.<br />Bad gratuitous 3D shots.<br />Bad everything.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed!  I won't waste my time on the next two movies in the series.<br /><br />The book was exciting enough to remain a classic of English literature and a favorite of generations of readers.  Peter Jackson et al didn't have to add or change anything to make the story exciting.  What a waste!

030758836X|4.0|I am really glad that I stuck with this novel.  My wife bought this for me because she had heard great things about it.  I had seen a lot of hype over it and thought that I would give it a shot.  I have to be honest, I probably started and stopped reading this book about four times before I could finally get into it.  It probably took me until about the chapter titled: Amy Elliott Dunne, April 21,2009, diary entry before I was hooked.  By then I had gotten into the rhythm of the back and forth of the points-of-view of Nick and Amy as well as the flashbacks from the past and the current events.  I truly enjoyed that I could not tell for a long time who was the villain and who was the victim.  I also could not tell for a long time IF there had even been a crime.  I do not want to give the ending away so I will say that the reason why I did not give this five stars was because the character that is the villain, is a real psychopath.  It felt a little over the top. I know we all have to suspend disbelief when we are reading fiction and part of the reason we may read these books is for a brief escape and/or to live vicariously through the story but, c'mon - really?  Is anyone really this twisted and vindictive?  By the end of the story, I actually felt sorry for the 'victim'.  I also felt sorry that another victim is roped into the villain's warped life.  All in all, I did enjoy reading this book and it did keep me guessing. I would recommend this to people and suggest that if the beginning is a little slow for you - keep with it and there is a good chance that you may end up enjoying this novel.
B008Y768XO|4.0|What a great dog story.  I loved this movie.  This is a great movie for a family to watch together.
B00005JLEU|4.0|I love this movie to death. I watched it the first time with my older brother who moved away a few years ago. So this movie does have sentimental value to me. However, if you are going to buy this product, word of advice, buy it from Amazon, not from Melody's Media Corner. Reason why is because they shipped it with FedEx as the carrier. I got a notification saying that my package was in town and was out for delivery on May 30th. It came a day later, which is usually fine, no problem with that. Until I opened the package. Inside the factory sealed case were two loose discs, both of them scratched badly, and both of the holders were broken. Along with that, the back of the discs have a distinct, curvy, rainbow pattern to it, as if it has been through a wash. Not sure what happened along the way, but I'm very upset with the horrendous condition my package came in. It still plays normally, with just a few skips here and there. Overall, the movie is incredible, I recommend it to just about anyone! Just save yourself some frustration and buy it from Amazon.. not Melody's Media Corner.

B0067EKYS6|4.0|I enjoyed this remake.  It was very close to the 1974 version that Robert Redford did, but a bit more grandeous and colorful.  If you are not familiar with the story, it is basically a love story, with sinister dealings and deceit interwoven.  There is also the concept of how the filthy rich just play with people,to achieve their own desires, without even a second thought.  It is also a sad story, in that respect, as you will see when you watch it.<br /><br />The movie begins at Perkins Sanitarium, where Nick Carraway is talking to his doctor about Gatsby (DiCaprio) as he watches the fluffy white snow twirl in the air.  The doctor suggests that Nick (Toby McQuire) write about Gatsby, to get it out and make himself feel better.  Nick is obviously distraught about losing his friend, and some other realizations he has had.<br /><br />Flash back to the summer of 1922.  The stock market is soaring up and liquor is flowing. Nick rents a small house on Long Island in the middle of the filthy rich, where he can have a peaceful vacation.  Turns out he is right next to Gatsby, and they get to be good friends, \\"Old Sport\\".<br /><br />Nick's cousin Daisy is married to filthy rich Tom Buchanan, and the marriage is not exactly lovey-dovey.  Daisy also knows Gatsby from a long time ago.<br /><br />Gatsby went from dirt poor to filthy rich within a year or so and nobody knows anything about him or where the money comes from.  Most folks have never even met him.  He seems to have some strange friends and a lot of secret phone calls.  Everbody has a story about Gatsby though, and everybody attends his lavish weekend parties.  They are extravagently unbelievable.  The house is a mansion equivalent to a castle.  The movie combines CGI nicely with real actors and real scenery.<br /><br />Again - I enjoyed it.

0062014536|2.0|For me,  Requiem was a disappointing end to a good trilogy.<br /><br />I liked Delirium and even loved Pandemonium. Lena had undergone a great character development and newly-introduced Julian was very likeable. I did not really like the character of Alex (her love interest in book 1 who was captured at the end) that much, but he was away the whole of book 2. Lena's life in the Wilds changed her character for the better.<br /><br />But then Requiem... Of course the previous book ended with Alex reuniting with Lena, while she is now with Julian. The beginning of the book is almost entirely about how Lena is jealous about Alex' new relationship and how she is actually leading Julian on, because she is still in love with Alex. Later fortunately she turned by and got back to her old self, but only after Alex left. This really disappointed me, because Lena had become such a strong character in the last 2 books and this jealous girl was not. The rest of the book was a series of events that showed that rebels were gathering and the government was trying to stop them. Lena's long-lost mother also stops by, but this does not add much to the story.<br />Of course Alex was not very nice during this book, but what will you expect from someone who has been in prison to save the girl he loves only to find out she has found someone else when he comes back.<br />Julian is such a great guy, he gave up everything to run away with Lena to Wilds. He is always there for her, he does not deserve to be treated like Lena did. One time she is nice to him and the other she ignores him. This was a bit of a disappointment after their great relationship in Pandemonium, but it was sort of to be expected after Alex returning.<br />I liked the parts where Hana (Lena's best friend from before the Wilds) was narrating. She gave the reader the opportunity of experiencing the government-controlled cities, not only the Wilds. She has a strong character and she fights back against the Cure.<br /><br />Then what I most disliked about the book was the ending. I was very surprised when I found out this was the end of the series. The ending was so abrupt, it seemed weird there was no next book.<br />The whole book the writer has been building up to a conclusion. And exactly when you think all your questions will be answered the book stops. What will happen to Hana, will she escape and will she and Lena live together in the Wilds? Who will Lena choose, Julian or Alex? What will happen to the revolution overall, will the Invalids win? All this was unanswered. Talking about an anti-climax ... The ending of the book kind of ruined the whole trilogy for me. What good is a nice story when there is no actual ending?<br /><br />So, while Delirium and Pandemonium were great books, Requiem, mostly because of the ending, was not. I would strongly advise the writer to write a fourth book, because I am still full of questions. For now I am leaving it at 2 stars, for the rest of the book was OK.<br /><br />[...]ook was the ending. I was very surprised when I found out this was the end of the series.

B00005N6KG|4.0|Bought a pair of these 15 years ago and they lasted all this time.  Actually, until my husband got too rough with them and pulled the delicate wires.  This pair is much more delicate in feel which worries me, but it makes them super lightweight, which I love.<br />The old earbuds were bigger, and in my opinion not made for the human ear.  They really hurt my ears after a minute or two of listening.  This pair has smaller, super soft earbuds that are shaped to fit a human ear!  Without the sound you wouldn't even know they're on.<br />The price is reasonable, but the sound could be louder/clearer.  There is no static, just not enough volume.  Maybe I need to remove the cushion on the buds?  Lastly, my old pair folded, which made it easy to fit into a pocket.  I really miss this feature!<br />All in all, these are a great little pair of lightweight, comfortable earphones, with a decent sound.  The foldability is the only missing feature stopping them from being a 5 stars rating for what I need.
0062059963|2.0|I liked the first book of this series. The whole Bachelorette thing was new and interesting. A normal girl has to compete with 24 other girls to marry the prince, never seen that before in a book. The book had a good pace and I liked the relationship of prince Maxon and America. The whole dystopian theme in the book was not really there, but just as YA romance book it was pretty good. So I was excited to read the second book: The Elite. The cover looked amazing, so I had my hopes up.<br /><br />But when I started reading the Elite, I soon discovered it was not merely as good as the Selection.<br />The whole Bachelorette/competition thing was reduced to a minimum. There were a few challenges for the remaining girls, but the concept that made book 1 good was gone.<br />Another thing that made me not like the book was America constantly getting mad at Maxon for spending time with other girls. She just could get her mind around it that he did that because he had to in the competition. She was constantly doubting herself and being jealous of the other girls. Her character therefore came accross as weak and insecure.<br />Also the 'violent' rebels that were described in the summary were non-existent. Sure there were a few 'attacks', but nothing really happened with that and they sure were not violent.<br />The worst was that the whole plot of the book only revolved around the love triangle of America, Aspen and Maxon. America and Maxon in the first book were cute together, but adding Aspen, her boyfriend before the Selection, in the second book did certainly not make the book better. A love triangle as such is not bad, but America became really irritating because of it. She was constantly changing her mind who she wants to be with and this most of the time without apparent reason. This becomes very annoying after the third change, make up your mind already! The character of Aspen also was not developed, to me he just remained this annoying boy who kept getting between America and Maxon.<br />With this book I got the feeling that if I skipped half of it I would still understand everything perfectly. The ending was pretty boring, no cliffhanger or anything and I am not sure I will read the next one. So, the first book was not good as a dystopian book and this one is not even good as a romantic one.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book, the love triangle is just too annoying and all-consuming and the protagonist is unlikeable.<br /><br />http://www.evelinesbooks.blogspot.nlrica and Maxon.<br />With this book I got the feeling that if I skipped half of it I would still understand everything perfectly.

B008PO8PG4|2.0|Expected to get Lang Lang playing Chopin<br />Didn't expect family movies of his youth and the story of him becoming a 'star'
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Ive been waiting for two games on amazon..zombie tsunami and scribblenauts remix..i am happy to see that scribblenauts has made it to amazon..its a fun game where u type the name of ANYTHING in and it appears on the screen..you can even descibe the color,size,etc and it will have what you asked for..theres a playroom area where you can just have fun with your creations or theres a challenge mode where you have to create things to get you to the next level..this is a game thats good for the whole family!

B004SCN2F6|5.0|I'll keep this review short and sweet:<br /><br />This game is awesome. It is NOT a casual game. The depth and detail of this game is incredible. I have it on my Kindle Fire and my Galaxy Victory.<br /><br />Buy it.<br /><br />5/5 Stars!
630522577X|5.0|The movie arrived quickly my mail.  The dvd was in perfect shape.  I have loved this movie since I was a little girl.  It's fun to watch it over again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show!  Amazing cast and plot twists!  Highly recommend watching all 3 seasons before the 4th one starts in Jan 2014!
B000002UVX|5.0|I was looking for Machine Gun for years on compilations and could not find it.  I am so happy to relocate Band of Gypsys and rock in the car :-)
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I think that hill climb racing was really fun you get to pick your car and pick your world it was an amazing game you should buy this game fun and easy
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a great hidden object game. Lots of things to figure out and find. I couldn't stop playing had to know what happened.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Completely entertaining, the characters really came to life for me.<br /><br />Didn't find a single place that I wanted to skip through.
0375851569|5.0|It's a very nice books collection. Kids loved it so much and they read it over and over again. I would recommend this to anyone looking for good reads for young kids.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|Good read on the subject, basically the book that started it all. Good place to start, raises a lot of questions and starts the thought process.
B0096HIEE2|2.0|I think this movie was a lot of hype, and the story just wasn't there. Not one of Channing Tatum's best.
B0086700CM|5.0|so i think this temple run is sooo awsome i love it i downloaded it on my phone so awsome.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved everything about this book. Sylvia has you engaged from the beginning and it is very hard to put this book down. I would recommend this book to everyone who is looking for a hot sexy read.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|We watched it twice in the same week.  Great imagery and plot.  I am glad to have it as part of my movie collection.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I've read this book already but can't get enough. I'm going to read it again and collect the others. It's great
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have been waiting for this book for a long time.  His writing is beautiful and he is truly gifted.  That being said I did find this story disjointed at times.  I wish we would have delved into more of Abdullah's life.  I also wanted to know more about the little boy who befriended Abdullah's nephew.  I felt a lot of pieces of the puzzle needed put together.  The fact that Pari did not remember the feathers crushed me!  He walked for a day to get the one feather!  I just wished for a different ending to an already sad story.
B00821OX98|2.0|The concept seems cool, but after about three episodes or so, it just seems like they are trying too hard to make it work. I lost interest.
B0047T86G0|1.0|This book does not include all the opening information of the dictionary, such as what the abbreviations mean and what the phonetic coding stands for. As a student of the English language, I always read that information first. Without it, the usefulness of the dictionary is greatly decreased.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|I guess I should have guessed since it had a lot about dogs and racing...two things I'm just not into (sorry dog lovers). I liked the main character though.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|it is epic best game i ever played on my kindle grafics are the best how did the creaters make such a good game
B005OCHOZS|4.0|This was a good read.  If you enjoyed &#34;Born to Run&#34; you will like &#34;Eat and Run.&#34;<br /><br />It was interesting to learn about Scott Jurek's diet and trianing philosphies.<br /><br />The personal account of his races were interesting as well.<br /><br />Fizzled out a little at the very end or I would have given it 5 stars.<br /><br />I recommend this book.
0399226907|5.0|Excellent story with hard pages. My toddler loves it. The food the caterpillar eats interests him the most. He likes trying to stick his fingers through the holes of the food the caterpillar eats mid story.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book may change your life.  It is the most motivating book I have ever read in my life.  I highly recommend it.  I wonder how many Vibram shoes or chia seeds were sold because of this book.  LOL!<br /><br />Great read.  Starts off a litte slow, but you will be rewarded for hanging in there.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Fun and intriguing series, though I don't see how they can keep this going for more than one more year.
B000VWMUPK|4.0|At this time in his life, Mr. Clapton seemed to be having trouble reconciling his fame (CLAPTON IS GOD) with his private persona (he puts his trousers on , one leg at a time). So he went to the Music. His technical expertise shown on this album is astounding. His guitar riff on &#34;Let it Rain&#34;, would give any world class guitar player fits. When he played it, the thought I had was, &#34;Show  Off&#34;.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I devoured gone girl an  sharp objects, dark place  took me longer and bored me a bit. It falls a little flat for me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My daughter and I watched all 3 seasons over the last 5 days. My only complaint is that there are so few shows in any of the seasons......I want more!!!
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|It was a pretty good book but boring at times. I would recommend this book but it's one of those books that once read it once u don't feel like reading it a second time
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Pretty good app, but I guess I'm just not that big of an Angry Birds fan, which is why I gave it a 3 star rating. I did like the Star Wars twist on it though. The levels are comical and fun especially if your a Star Wars fan, like I am. If you have liked the other Angry Bird games you would probably like this one.<br /><br />A Pikmin Review.
B005F2BBLK|4.0|Very good and informative & entertaining for all who watched I also info me friends about this movie they love it.
B0086700CM|4.0|Great app, love the fact that it's free. But I gave it a 4 star rating because I think the second one is a little better. You should get at least one of the Temple Run games though. Awesome app.<br /><br />A Pikmin Review
B001XUJMZK|5.0|Very good and informative & entertaining for all who watched I also info me friends about this movie they love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing app! If you liked the first one you'll love this one! A 5 star rating I s rarely given out by Pikmin. The Gems and new power abilities ad an extra spice to the game, plus it's free. New obstacles to avoid and much more! A really fun and addicting app.<br /><br />A Pikmin Review
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game. You have to use your brain to solve the puzzles. The way you<br />interact with the game is way cool. Can't wait for the next one.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Amazing! I am a huge Slender fan and this is a great slender app that is bound to give you chills. The only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating is a constant music mild but noticeable lag in movement. I found myself whispering to myself, &quot; Shhhh. Shhhh, your fine, your fine, just keep moving.&quot; As I desperately ran around looking for notes. If you have liked the other Slender games this the app for you. Can't wait for chapter 2!<br /><br />A Pikmin Review.
B008LUM25M|3.0|The premise is original enough, but the book is badly written and the main character has an awful martyr complex going on which made me impossible to get behind him. I found the slang annoying and the action scenes weren't as exciting because I couldn't give a damn about the characters. I thought this would be a fun summer read but it was just annoying. Let's hope the film's better.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I like this App.<br />Easy to use. Works well with my Galaxy Tablet. You can send to Folders, Email, etc. with a couple of Clicks!<br />Great little App!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I throughly enjoyed how detailed Dr. Alexander was with his experinces and could not put the book  down.<br /><br />It was so hopeful and therapeutic.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|I was in the mood for Bond movies and it was most satisfying! I loved the ease of using Amazon Prime!
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Tense and well acted.  Historically accurate. Ben Affleck did a great job both acting and directing.  Would recommend it to my friends.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved it.  I like to read the books that movies are based on before seeing the movie.  I was totally wrapped up in<br />Ender's adventure from the very beginning to the end.  This fast paced read kept my interest, and curiosity turning<br />the pages.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This was a truly wonderful film.  The plot, the acting, the effects were all outstanding.  Have watched it twice.  Second time even better than the first.  So many subtle things you miss in the first viewing.
B009MEEZXI|5.0|This was worth every penny. A must see for every parent and child who either bullies or has been bullied. Helps us understand those who process information differently and learn to appreciate the unique gifts they offer to the world. This will enrich every life that is willing to accept the lessons it teaches us.  I haven't been so inspired in a long time!
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|Yawnful.  Saw it twice on stage and have read the book.  Just thought this was overacted and boring.  Don't think it deserved the accolades it received.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I did not like this book. I was only 25% into it when I got really bored with it. From what I read up to that point, I figured I could start reading on any page of this book and get the same basic story, so I jumped a couple of hundred pages forward and found I was right. At that point I stopped reading this book. I do not waste time finishing a book I don't like.
0802473156|5.0|This book is wonderful! Dr. Chapman is a genius. I first heard about this book when Dr. Chapman spoke at my church. He mentioned some things that (seriously) sparked my interest into reading this book so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Since reading it, I've been able to recognize my own love language which has helped me to get to know myself better (which I didn't think was possible) and also the love languages of my loved ones. I even try to find it in random people I meet in hopes of connecting with them better.<br /><br />Love is God's language and his gift to this world. Why wouldn't anyone want to learn to speak it fluently? I really can't thank you enough Dr. Chapman!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an easy to read calculator. I needed a calculator for class and it fit the bill when downloaded to my Kindle.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a really fun app. I really like how big of an upgrade it was from temple run 1. This app has more avatars more money it has zip lining bigger monsters and coins.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app learns my language really well and stores it. Quickly anticipates my writing style and makes similar messages fast. Love it
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It drew me in and kept my attention. I loved how it was written from the survivors point of view.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I was skeptical but Van Halen turned out a great album for a 25 year hiatus. I jam this album all the way through weekly.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Very well written and interesting theme.  Captivating.  Enjoyed the characters.  This book really pulled on the heart strings.  Highly recommeded
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I LOVED THE SHOW!! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE 3RD SEASON TO COME ON!!! I RECOMMEND THIS SHOW TO ANYONE!
1594481717|5.0|great new ideas, extensive review of the landscape of our world.  amusing lists like the 10 symphonies you should give a listen,etc.  thought provoking/well written
B009AMANBA|2.0|I was very disappointed in the story content. We thought it would be better considering the Academy Awards nominations it received.
B0076I624W|5.0|I think that if you are buying Meet Joe Black, you are familiar with the movie and, like me, are buying it in Blu-Ray for a better quality version for your new 60 inch or larger 1080P TV to watch on. The movie still is a little soft for 1080P, so it isn't perfect, not sure whether it was the upgrade process or just the fact that it is an old movie, but it still is worth buying at the lower 'Old Movie' price providing that you don't already have it on a standard DVD.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Enjoyable action filled movie. Could have been a half hour shorter! Great special effects!<br />A very good prequel! Good casting!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was great at holding my attention and keeping me captivated with its suspense and twists and turns. I would have preferred a different ending as this one it kind of let me down. However I enjoyed it very much up until this point.
0792839749|5.0|This movie , without a doubt should be preserved FOREVER ! It is a sweet and loveable story . I cannot think of anyone who would not want see it ! Everyone will enjoy and love it . No family should be without this wonderful movie !
B008BU75IQ|3.0|It was very dull, compared with Archer's previous writings. It didn't seem to have any real purpose or direction. I lost interest in the characters or really cared about the outcome. It just ended and I felt no sense of pleasure for having spent the time reading it. This is from an avid reader of all of Archer's previous novels.
B00B5ARKDE|4.0|I will warn that the product description was bad, it gave many people the impression that this was a stand alone movie like the Star Wars Lego movies.  Instead, this DVD is a collection of the cut away scenes from the Lego Batman 2 video game.<br /><br />If you played and completed the game, then you DON'T need to get this DVD.  Since the video game didn't have a replay theater option like in Lego PoTC game, I got the dvd to watch all those funny scenes in their entirety.  It's kinda lame that the game didn't have the replay option, but I don't mind getting this DVD and adding it to my Lego movie collection.
B00493E1GI|3.0|Beautiful movie for the cinematography.  As with the book, it's still just lacking....something.  I think Elizabeth Gilbert comes across as more self involved than enlightened.  But it's still lovely to watch and the music is great.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|a few years ago everybody expected this one was gonna be a lame remake.but they got kicked their asses the front of screen.This Film makers added more satanic factors on its orginal which tends to be sucks,but it turs out they got around with it.this movie is something i wanna watch again in theater.Because in Japan,flicks fee is almost 20$ at one time,but this one is worth watching 2 or 3 or more!
B005IQZB14|4.0|I did really appreciate the story, it made me cry and there were some lighter moments as well.  She made hiking this trail seem pretty awful.  Overall, the author's self-centered focus on some of the more mundane aspects of her hike sometimes left me frustrated but I finished feeling inspired and glad that she shared this journey with us.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Since the last undate the Kindle app no longer retains the place I was reading when I last closed the book. This happens on both my Samsung Galaxy Note I (I717) and my Lenovo Thinkpad (U1838). This is incredibly annoying.
1441761268|5.0|Great characterization!  Interesting storyline with many twists and turns. Well-researched hhistorical details. Everyone in my book club gave it rave reviews.
B005OYKI1I|4.0|this was another good movie, a little predictable, but worth watching, definately.  can't wait for the last one!  It's gonna be good!
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is absolutely perfect.  Nice big buttons, easy-to-read screen, and free!  Perfect for calculating grades, using in the grocery store, and lets my Kindle replace yet another device.  I have found no cons to this app.  Simple and straightforward for those not requiring a scientific calculator.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the story until it got to the end and then I was very disappointed.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because once I read the end, I felt like I had wasted my time reading the book.
B006ZWLXZ8|5.0|This album is amazing,  I already had this in digital format but there is whole new level to it on vinyl.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I would definitely recommend viewing this movie in Blue Ray - it is awesome! You won't regret this purchase in my opinion.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|Just watch Susan's TED talk and you'll basically get the point of the book. A lot of the comments about working in groups are not necessarily about introversion.
B005SEZCVK|5.0|I love hourlong episodes of TV - with Amazon instant there is no commercial ever - so it is more like a seamed mini-movie each time.  Ultimately, the series is entertaining and has humor, tension, creativity, and good enough acting for me to not judge.  It leads up to the movie Serenity - which I always look forward to after re-watching the series (it's a must do).<br /><br />Enjoy!
B001KZG99A|5.0|If for no other reason, see this film for Robert Downey, Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark. He's endlessly entertaining in the role.
B003DS3GC0|2.0|Just not my kind of action movie and I love mystery, police, murder etc shows but this one.....alittle too much
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I got turned onto James' writing by a friend who thought I could use some of the lessons and wisdom that come through in his writing. I found it to be raw and emotionally very powerful. His new book is very much the same except polished around this core idea of Choosing Yourself which really spoke to me as I'm trying to figure out what to do with my life and how to do it. I would highly recommend this book for anyone struggling to understand what is really going on out there in the world and trying to figure out what they can do about it for themselves and their families. If you only read one part of this book, read about the Daily Practice. Amazing.
B0019FOC5E|2.0|The disc does not have the sound I remember from the movie.  It is fun to sing to any way.
B005VPXNV2|5.0|One of the scariest movies made without excessive gore or demonic possession yet so disturbing your feet will sweat throughout most of it. So well done.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I've been playing this game for the better part of a day now and fro m what I've seen it's a pretty decent game.  The tutorial was straight forward and helps you pick up the game quick.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I bought the whole trilogy because of the reviews about how good the Mortal Instruments was said to be. I couldn't, for the life of me (I tried twice - about a year apart), finish the first book. I got halfway and was so bored and disenchanted that I just gave up. I don't know who's reading YA books in Hollywood, but they need to stop. This movie is gonna be a flop - just like the other book I couldn't bring myself to finish (I even have a signed copy, if anyone wants it) that SOMEONE thought would make a great movie - Beautiful Creatures. If I have to read about one more misunderstood heroine or emasculated jock, I'm gonna puke.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|Predictable but then what can u expect.  Dancing was great - story the same.  Worth watching, you do not have to pay close attention....
B008FPOIT6|5.0|With a background in library science, this book had me from the title page.....loved the connections between the written word and technology.....loved this book and it's characters and want to visit that bookstore.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Thought it would be a fun game to keep the grandkids entertained, but it wasn't at all!  Sorry I bought it.
B0001WE6U2|5.0|I broke my original hood and bought this Nikon hood product to replace it. As expected, Nikon makes a quality product.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this on the suggestion of a friend. I haven't regretted a single word, the book is amazing! Definately a must read!
B001JV5B12|5.0|underworld and underworld evolution are one of the best movies EVER! I have to say its intense action and dialogue had me stricken
B00C50NV2M|5.0|I have used these glasses with the new Sony 65 inch 4K TV and I have to admit the 3D image is awesome, the images are projected off the screen in very realistic detail, I was awestruck. I would like to see a clip-on version as I need to wear my glasses all the time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A beautiful story that created such vivid images of hate and love.The ending left me breathless...afraid to watch the movie in fear of disappointment.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|\\"After Earth\\" is a combination of adventure, comedy and SI-FI all in one! If you love adventures, you would love this movie. It begins one thousand years after humans are forced to leave Earth because they destroyed it. They reach a new planet. Humans think their safe until they find an alien species that are putting humans in danger. General Cypher Raige (Will Smith) then finds a way of defeating the aliens. I'm sure you want to know how he did it, so watch the movie to learn the craft of a true ranger. General's son, Kitia Raige, (Jaden Smith) goes on a trip with his father. On the way there though, the ship crash lands on Earth! Cypher's legs are broken and Kitia has to go far away to retrieve an emergency beacon! Can he do it? Would they be able to survive in this dangerous environment?<br /><br />I loved \\"After Earth\\"! This film was a mixture of everything that someone would want! It shows what can possibly happen to humans. I personally adore Will and Jaden Smith. Any movie where they are together makes it a fantastic and funny movie. What makes the movie better is that they play father and son, when in real life they are just that! Father and Son.What else was interesting is how many birds, animals and wales were in the movie clearly showing what our planet would be like without human interference.<br /><br />There are also a few scenes with Cypher and his wife, Faia (Sophie Okoneda) where they have a very cute and adorable conversation and shows General's soft side. My favorite character would be Kitia. He is scared and frightened a lot in this film. He is alone at a young age, on unfamiliar Earth, one thousand years after humans left. It must have been scary! Kitia grows quickly and learns things on this hunt for the beacon.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Kitia does not listen when his father orders him to comeback knowing that something bad happens, and instead jumps off a very tall cliff and tries to make it to the beacon without proper gear. He gets chased and caught by a giant eagle that decided to \\"adopt\\" Kitia and even helps him along the way. Kitia's camera, that Cypher is using to see what's going on, gets destroyed and he must continue his journey without his father's guidance.<br /><br />I recommend \\"After Earth\\" to ages twelve and up. This movie is very graphic and may be a bit too intense for younger kids. If you like adventure and action you would adore this movie! I give \\"After Earth\\" five out of five starts because it was so great in many ways.<br /><br />Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

B000F8O35U|5.0|I had misplaced my other copy and disney put it in the vault. My 3 year old granddaughter is into mermaids and I had to get it for her to enjoy. Of course, I enjoyed it too.
B00C5XBAOA|2.0|The basic design of the dolls aren't bad, but the actual play value of them is lost in that design. Sofia and Amber's heads are very easy to pop off and while ours haven't popped off several times, it's only been a day. Like other reviews have mentioned, the only doll that can stand on her own is the Queen Mother, while the King and James topple over with the design. The point of this design is that their voices will work on the soundbox of the castle you can also buy...big mistake. If they activate voices at all, it's only Sofia's voice. I paid $24.98 at Wal*Mart on this and it's maybe worth $10 at the absolute most.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|it took way too long for me to get this movie. a whole month? on the other hand the movie is hilarious and i think its one of the best yet..
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love watching an entire series in one weekend, and commerical free! Juliana Marguiles rocks! Loved her since ER and Cantebury's Law! Thanks Amazon Prime!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|So awesome!! Really good message !! Just amazing  must read😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄 I loved it. Just can't describe😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄 I loved it so much
B008JFUMHE|5.0|\\"Now You See Me\\" tells the story of a group of magicians called The Four Horsemen who use their skills to pull off some of the greatest international robberies of their generation. Featuring Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKenny (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), the Four Horsemen make a dream team of street magicians. Since they have made their stunts public, allowing the world to \\"witness\\" the robberies, authorities are in hot pursuit of the four, now wanted criminals. Detective Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is accompanied in his search for the illusive magicians by Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and French detective Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). Will the Four Horsemen be able to pull of their final act without being caught, or will it be curtains for the criminal performers? Our KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Raven D, raved about this film. See her review below.<br /><br />I absolutely love this film. \\"Now You See Me\\" is like nothing I've ever seen before. The plot is so original and full of fresh ideas and witty comedy. I love how fast paced this film is, I swear there isn't a dull moment from beginning to end. The plot itself has so many twists and turns it should be a pretzel, but it keeps the audience guessing the whole time and hits you with major shock factor. The acting in this film is incredible. It features a group of incredible actors - Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson and many others. I love how each character has a unique quirk and personality that you can really see, but they all work together so well. The cinematography and special effects in this film are phenomenal. It is bursting with rich colors and textures, drawing you into the magic and making the illusions appear so real. The soundtrack is also amazing. It is suits each scene very well, while keeping a consistent theme and feel throughout the movie. \\"Now You See Me\\" is definitely not one to miss.<br /><br />It's hard for me to pick a favorite character because I love all of the Horsemen, but when it comes down to it I have to say I like the characters Daniel Atlas and Jack Wilder. Daniel, played by Jesse Eisenberg, often tries to assert himself as the head of the Four Horsemen. He is controlling, very specific and difficult to deal with, but he is also the funniest character which is attributed to all of his demanding qualities. I love every film Jesse Eisenberg is in and I think he is perfect for the role of Daniel Atlas. I also like Jack Wilder, played by Dave Franco, because he is the craftiest of the magicians. He isn't the \\"card trick\\" or \\"read your mind\\" type, he's just a good old fashioned pick-pocket for whom no door is ever locked.. He is sort of the \\"muscle\\" to the operation because he is able to help the horsemen get out of tight situations and he is also very funny.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when the Four Horsemen have to escape from the FBI after their second robbery. Jack Wilder has to stay behind to burn secret files. When he has an unexpected run-in with Detective Rhodes, an action filled fight sequence and high speed chase follow. This scene is filled with suspense, action and incredible stunts and it shows that the Horsemen are always two steps ahead.<br /><br />I recommend this film for ages 12+ because of violence and mild mature language. Overall I give \\"Now You See Me\\" 5 out of 5 stars.e to pick a favorite character because I love all of the Horsemen, but when it comes down to it I have to say I like the characters Daniel Atlas and Jack Wilder.

B005723JSQ|5.0|You'll love this book if you like watching romantic comedies. I thought this book struck a nice balance between unrealistic characters/plot lines (it IS fiction, after all), and a believable story. I got hooked onto Sophie Kinsella in my teens, when I first discovered the Shopaholic series. This book transported me back to the feeling I got when I first read a Kinsella novel. It was laugh out loud funny and I could not wait to read more of the book. I'm sure there are many reviewers would might describe the ending as predictable, but I thought it was a very sweet and satisfying ending.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am hooked on this series now that I have watched the back seasons.  I can't wait for the next season.
B00AW57L96|4.0|An absorbing book, well written and with a surprise twist at the end, too. Recommended. Good for a holiday read.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Every time I pass a silo (which happens pretty frequently since I live in Oklahoma), I think of this book. It was a solid four stars. Thought-provoking while the story line changes and leaves you guessing. What happens when the earth has been used and deprived of all natural resources? What happens to environments when animals become prematurely extinct due to human interference? This book is Hugh's version of what happens after...
B00CAJMGDI|4.0|Reminds me of Vanessa-Mae, whose music I was thrilled to discover back in the 90s.  This is in the same vein, but a little more contemporary, with a lot more dance-like rhythms to it.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Although a person who believes in the importance of religion in one's life, the book, The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins provides the reader with not only a glimpse into the radical atheist's mind, but also a basis for the argument for which an atheistic mindset is the most practical. One detail that particularly piqued my interest in this topic was the mention of the founding fathers of the United States. Since a young age, we Americans have all stated in the Pledge of Allegiance \\"...one nation, under God...\\". While the United States government tends to pride itself of the separation of church and state, the argument can simply arise that if the people who founded this nation believed in God, then why shouldn't its citizens. Although a viable point, Richard Dawkins brings into play the complexity of the politics at that time. While it very well could have been a group of men driven by their faith, it is equally possible that men like Jefferson and Washington could have been using their faith as an advantage in the political and social aspects of colonial society. Furthermore, this shows that the separation between church and state cannot really exist, for they are actually one single entity. Although there were many specific details that intrigued me, perhaps the most mind challenging concept was that of the entire book. While I do not necessarily agree with everything Dawkins mentioned, his piece has opened my eyes to the other side of things. The coexistence of science and religion is a recently publicized controversial topic that has taken over the talk shows and internet blogs of our day and age. This concept has not only caused tension between power forces, but also in more personal relationships. In this book, the author takes an obvious side to this, which makes sense due to the fact that he is an atheist. However, I do not agree with the black and white nature of this particular controversy. Whether or not science and religion can coexist or not depends completely on the people of a given area. In short, the conflict and tension between the science world and religious world will never go away. However, how we deal with this issue is completely dependent on us. Dawkins presents an interesting and insightful piece on the typical, radical, atheist's thoughts and arguments. Definitely worth reading. \\"I am against religion because it teaches us to be satisfied with not understanding the world.\\" -Richard Dawkins

B00AKFG15S|4.0|Kane and Abel and The Prodigal Daughter were matching pillars.  Both well written, stand alone books that earned Archer a reputation as a master story teller.  The Clifton Chronicles is a trilogy, set over a a century, using now familiar but still enjoyable Archer-esque twists and turns.  This book ends the trilogy, and is well written and enjoyable.  However, the trilogy itself could well have been conceived and written as another set of pillars, and this, I think would have been a far better, more enjoyable read.<br /><br />This being said, although enjoyable, the trilogy (and this contribution to the threesome) is not even in the same league and Archer's earlier works.  Still enjoyable and a page turner for a quiet afternoon, but not something that was going to keep me up, glued to every word.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Slow start but hard to put down. Once the action starts it only gets better and better as you keep reading
B005QBBCMI|5.0|Wow ! Stumbled upon this movie and am super glad I did.<br />This is a masterpiece and portrays the subtle despair of wanting to let go of something that we really really love and just want to hold on.<br /><br />An excellent performance and experience
1400079276|1.0|It's impossible for me to know if some of this book's nuances are lost in translation but suffice it to say this English version is one of the worst books I've read. The prose is  meretricious and pretentious. The plot, such as it is, is contrived and inorganic. The dialogue is stilted (I lost count of the number of times characters recited each other's formal names [Mr Hoshino, Mr Nakata etc.] in order indicate the gravity of their next line) and packed full of pointless detail (again, I lost count of the number of times we were treated to a rundown on a character's choice of food) and exposition and philosophical name-dropping. Not one of the characters is remotely believable or particularly interesting. I enjoy the strange and surreal in fiction, and have read some of the greatest exponents of this type of work, but I'm afraid Murakami just doesn't cut the mustard. Here the weirdness is so self-conscious as to be irritating. There is no cohesion to the story, with many characters and events simply being used to pad the plot. Obvious allusions to Greek mythology, and gratuitous scenes of animal torture, are thrown in for shock value but have little relevance. Sad to say, neither Kafka's or Mr Nakata's journeys are anything more than pointless drudges through a meaningless void.

B00A9ET4MC|4.0|This is a lyrical novel contrasting experiences of family, class and race in contemporary Nigeria and a narrow slice of the US.  The thread connecting characters across three continents is a love story.  I found underlying themes re: \\"being Other,\\" with rich context of being an outsider in America, an outsider to academia, even an outsider among African immigrants in America.  Escaping the chaos of Nigeria, Ifemelu transcends loss and humiliation to rise to professional and social prominence (With two successive unlikely \\"catches\\") in America. To this white Midwester-reared reader, her voice about the role of race in America is authentic, albeit still within the range of comfort that is a common theme.  Her motivation to chuck it all and return to Nigeria--and potentially to the boyfriend of her high school and university years--is a bit weak, but it is, after all, the turning point for telling her story.  This is not a story of Nigeria.  It is a story of a Nigerian woman of intelligence and particular experience.  Worth reading.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I use this for backup batter for my Samsung Note 2 and my IPAD.  So far it has not run out of power.  It is small enough to carry in my purse.  I charged both electronics and battery pack still showed almost full charge.

B001U0HBPG|3.0|Disc was cracked causing the DVD player to not even recognize it.  I basically bought a product that I can't even use.<br /><br />Aside from the product, the shipping was fairly quick.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Though it subjects you to most of the mobile gaming b.s. like waiting times between games and paying for upgrades and is also kind of like the temple runner games. Not bad for a free game.
B000TDGGRY|3.0|I have read the others in this arc, would be hard pressed to say they are bad (I keep reading them), but they are somewhat formula based. Enjoyable read, like a roller coaster, get on, buckle up, turn off reason, enjoy the ride. The story moves quickly, and falls under what I (most likely incorrectly) refer to as men's pulp. All in all a fun read that starts, gets faster, and is enjoyable.

B007N85POS|4.0|I like this game as much as I like all the other Angry Birds games. There is only one thing I have a problem with, and it might be me, but when I try to scroll back to the sling shot, it shoots instead of scrolling back. Of course, that might just be me. Other than that everything else is fine. It's fun and a good take on the Rio movie. It's really cool.

B008JFUPBC|5.0|This is the kind of movie every father or male caregiver should take his son to see. It shows how the power of love and courage grows when the bond is under extreme duress. It allows all of us to wish we had a father or a son as brave as shown in After Earth!<br /><br />This is not a typical science fiction story, so if you are going to enjoy it you will have to shut-down that thinking brain of yours. Your mind will want to have a thousand questions answered about the world created in After Earth. And those questions are not going to get answered!<br /><br />This is also a many layered message movie. So if you are looking for constant and brainless adrenal rushes, like you got in the last two J.J. Abrams' Star Trek films, then you probably won't enjoy After Earth. But if you are like me, and you enjoy stories that are trying to challenge us to do better in the real world both with our relationships with those we love and with our environment, then you'll love After Earth!<br /><br />There is a strong pro-environment theme that runs through this story. The most important being that life on earth does not need us human beings in any way, shape, or form to prosper! In fact, it's quite obvious the earth's creatures will do a lot better once we are gone. It's extraordinarily sobering to realize that with the notable exception of small groups of tribal humans, like the Native Americans once inhabiting North America before Columbus, our present-day human race simply doesn't know how to and/or care to live in harmony with the rest of nature. Something After Earth makes crystal clear!<br /><br />See:[[ASIN:0312427905 The World Without Us]] and [[ASIN:B0012IV3PU Life After People (History Channel)]] and [[ASIN:0787995282 The Minds of Boys: Saving Our Sons From Falling Behind in School and Life]]
B0047WJ12K|1.0|Inception is an overrated MTV video for people with the attention span of celery. Anyone who finds it deep doesn't rise to the level of shallow.<br /><br />Specific complaints: while most modern \\"action\\" movies are guilty of this, the dynamic range of this soundtrack is wider than any I have yet heard. You have to turn the volume up to hear diCaprio's simian mumbling. Then they light off a pointless explosion or burst of useless machine gun fire which blows out your speakers. Awesome; now my neighbors love me.<br /><br />Who finds the stupid panning camera shots clever? Not me; they're tedious, nauseating and *boring.* They decidedly do not make up for the vapidity of the dialog, the over-explaining and telegraphing of absolutely everything and almost complete lack of plot. What is that you say? That the \\"multilayering\\" of the plot is supposed to make it clever? No, it makes it designed to appeal to the type of modern nincompoop who can't read a book without checking his cell phone or his twitter feed every two minutes. It's not clever, and it detracts from the dramatic flow in the same way that switching between TV programs to avoid commercials detracts from dramatic flow. I guess when you have enough context switches, it's harder for most people to tell how awful the plot is.<br /><br />The characters weren't even one dimensional characters: they are zero-dimensional characters; featureless points scattered over a landscape like bits of dandruff. Try to think of an adjective describing any one of the characters without referring to their appearance or job: you can't. The acting was horrendous; they don't act like people -they act like the human marionettes in bad TV police dramas. DiCaprio -the main character I'm supposed to sympathize with, did not change his facial expression more than a millimeter for the entire movie. The plot premise; the extremely tired, overused and moronic PKD \\"oooo, am I tripping out or in reality land, maaaan?\\" trope. Like we haven't seen that about a zillion times already in Science Fiction since the 50s, and mainstream movies since the 80s. It was dumb in the Matrix movies; it's offensively dumb done ... yet again in this stinker.<br /><br />The pacing is abysmal. The retardo-useless action scenes and atrocious CGI effects can't cover up the fact that it was literally a movie about a snooze fest.<br />The worst thing about it is the fact that people actually seem to think it is something beyond a silly MTV video. Why do people use the word \\"cerebral\\" applied to this movie? Because Di Caprio was able to successfully conjugate a verb once in a while? Because of the several plot threads? Boring and useless isn't the same as cerebral.n that about a zillion times already in Science Fiction since the 50s, and mainstream movies since the 80s.

B0083P1QUM|3.0|The majority of this book takes place over two days so you know it's GOT to be slow.  I didn't think Cornwell did a good job setting up characters either.  It was one of the worst I've read by her and I've read the entire Scarpetta series.  I'm being generous and giving it 3 stars for 2 reasons:  it picked up a little at the end and out of some loyalty for the author.  I have a hard time bashing someone I've read for years now, but I was pretty disappointed.

B00AEFYS8G|5.0|Along with his superb Dollars Trilogy - A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS (1964), FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE (1965), and THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY (1966) - Sergio Leone's poetically eloquent followup, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (Paramount, 1968), completes a body of work that stands as a metaphor for what makes a great western. The irony is that such an exclusively American genre should be so keenly represented in films made by a foreign director.<br /><br />ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is about a young widow (Claudia Cardinale) who inherits a stretch of land that is an ideal spot for a water station which could serve the railroad. A ruthless, hired gunslinger (Henry Fonda) also wants to get control of the land - and the widow - but his plans are disrupted by a mysterious, harmonica playing stranger (Charles Bronson) and a drifting outlaw with a price on his head (Jason Robards).<br /><br />Leone's film is an epic of breathtaking, contrasting proportions; from the sweeping vistas of Monument Valley to the extreme closeups of the characters whose weathered faces are landscapes in themselves. There's a deliberately operatic style, a kind of flamboyance, with a minimum of dialog and a maximum of gesture that speaks volumes. More than what's actually said, it's what is implied by the sparse dialog that's important. In addition, Ennio Morricone's hauntingly beautiful and often wryly humorous music score brings a memorable, bittersweet quality to the film.<br /><br />Probably the most outstanding aspect is the casting of quintessential good guy Henry Fonda as a cold blooded killer. This is a guy who doesn't even flinch after shooting a child at point blank range. It's an incredible study in sheer malevolence and ranks as one of Fonda's finest characterizations, certainly it's his most disturbing.<br /><br />Paramount's Blu-ray edition of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST contains both the one minute longer, unreleased version and the original theatrical cut, both of which have been meticulously restored. This home video presentation is truly eye-opening, and flawlessly preserves the film's pictorial brilliance as never before. Special features include a commentary with directors John Carpenter, John Milius and Alex Cox, historians Sir Christopher Frayling and Dr. Sheldon Hall, as well as cast and crew members. Also the featurettes, An Opera Of Violence, The Wages Of Sin, Something To Do With Death, Railroad: Revolutionising The West, and Locations Then And Now. Rounding things up is a production gallery and the original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />As anyone who loves great westerns knows, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is undeniably one of the greatest of them all, and this stunning Blu-ray is the best way to experience it.<br /><br />My highest recommendation.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Was compelled to watch one episode after the other.  Love these English shows.  Great acting and writing.  Well cast.<br />Plan to watch again!
0374533571|4.0|This book is by far one of the best I've read, especially after reading several depressing/pessimistic books throughout my years of high school.<br /><br />I liked how this book supports the idea that believing in silver linings leads to positive endings if and only if you keep on trying. The old saying that every cloud has a silver lining is what Pat is counting on in his life, especially since he returned home to live with his parents.<br /><br />Also, I like how throughout his path to improvement, Matthew Quick introduced other twisted characters: like Pat's father, who rarely speaks unless it's about the Eagles team, his mom who treated him like a child, his best friend Ronnie's widowed sister-in-law Tiffany, who has her own issues and her own therapist, and Pat's therapist who rides on a tailgate bus known as the `Asian Invasion' and is a diehard Eagles fan himself. This gives the feel that Pat is not an exception in his society; rather he's immersed in it and because of this, he's able to depict the theme of redemption through literature. In other words, Pat reads books on his ex-wife Nikki's English syllabus, hoping to impress her when they reconcile, and finds that many of the books are depressing. You would think that a mentally ill character like Pat, who lost everything, would be depressed as well, but he isn't at all.<br /><br />Another aspect that I liked about this book was Pat's goal: to have a happy ending to everything. He figures that if he works hard at something, it will all turn out the way he wants in the end. He applies that belief to everything he sees or lives, and gets frustrated with the books he reads that aren't happy endings.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say it's a great read and perfect for those who like happy endings.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a person who is certainly not privileged at all, and who works for a very small non-profit organization I STILL got a lot out of this book. I understand that the author is wealthy and has many resources I do not, but that doesn't make her any less relevant. I think people who try to toss the beauty of this book out based on the fact that the author is successful are trying to be misleading and should have their motivations (as well as their heads) examined. Her marriage advice alone is worth reading this book! I made an excellent choice in my husband and partner and that has made a huge difference in my success and potential for further success even though we both come from blue collar families. The advice to choose well and form a true partnership in which both people contribute equally is wonderful and will save many women the additional hardship of being saddled with a man who doesn't get it. I was also thrilled to read that children who are not raised by stay-at-home moms are not at a disadvantage or somehow damaged. That is certainly not the message the media gives us! I think more women need to learn about bias in the workplace, see examples of how women hold THEMSELVES back, and learn not to leave before we leave. The idea that we can sit at the table, raise our hands, volunteer for the challenging and high-profile assignments, not be with our kids 100% of the time (I learned that even as working moms we spend as much time with our kids as stay-at-home moms did in the 1970's!), secure them in high quality child care, and still raise happy, healthy, well-rounded, bonded and connected kids makes me want to sing. The guilt trip is over. Unpack everyone!

B0070Y46UY|4.0|&#34;This story will make you believe in God...&#34; So claims the opening chapter of this popular tome. Through the first 3/4 of this book, I thought I was enjoying the story of a man's spiritual journey and epic survival tale. Then, everything went off the rails for me, as the story became muddled in allegory or fantasy (I'm still not sure which it is.) In the end, I was left wanting more of an ending.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|The fun continues with this second installment in the Men in Black series.  Great DVD - great movie!  You won't be disappointed.
B00867GHS8|5.0|If you're at all skeptical of the fact that this movie was not originally made with 3D in mind, please know that Disney did a phenomenal job engineering this movie for 3D Blu-ray. If anything, the new effects actually add to the narrative and help pull you into the world that Pixar has created. I would say the quality of the 3D is on par with Avatar, in that you're so wrapped up in the film and the effect is so well done that you forget you're even wearing 3D glasses at all. But if you choose to turn off the 3D effect, you'll definitely notice a difference and, personally, I can't see myself choosing the original transfer after watching this new version. Highly recommended!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|But the great thing is we're able to believe that somewhere they're still flying.<br /><br />The heart of the matter is, the show, like other good science fiction, gives us hope for the future.<br /><br />I want to be on that ship, I'd fit right in and so would anyone else who's a fan. This was way ahead of it's time and short-sighted Hollywood didn't get it, they never do. It's all about the advertising, it's never about art.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I fell in love with the book when I read it! They did just as good on the movie! I recommend everyone to see this movie!
0425263908|5.0|I thought the first was great surprised the second was just as good. Waiting for the next one can&#34;t wait.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I am able to watch my you tube channels but there is no capability to fast forward or even turn the volume up without having to restart from the beginning. A little frustrating. I am watching in a kindle fire. Great streaming though.<br />I cannot seem to download videos either despite paying for the ad free version ($1.99)<br />I am awaiting an email from the developers.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is highly addictive and you  want<br />to keep getting your score higher and higher. It is hard<br />to put down.
B00992CF6W|4.0|ok i love this app its just you dont have everything like bedrock, pistons, buttons, levers and you cant craft or blow up tnt on creative
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|This a fairly typical teen kind of movie (based on a book). Think twilight with 'casters' instead of vampires and no love triangle and you pretty much know what kind of movie it is. It does have some good twist and turns to keep you intrigued. I would recommend it to people who enjoy supernatural kind of movies and don't take it too seriously.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Just wanted a &#34;chill out&#34; relax, feel good movie and this was it...very sensitive content...I mean,<br />the man is dying of polio..he's Catholic , and I suppose one can't even imagine being in that situation<br />wanting sexual encounter/experience before he dies....( what? you haven't lived until you had sex? NO..<br />you haven't lived until you've LOVED!)...and that is indeed what this movie is about...LOVE<br />and Helen Hunt who is married has to look at her own self in that.....very profound, emotional,<br />and moving....life's lessons in the end...a good lesson in LOVE...our basic fundamental instinct. :)!
0345803507|5.0|What can I say. These three books were great. I finished these three books within three weeks. I could&#34;t put them down.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I had heard of this game before but never played it . I enjoy the challenge. Great game!  I highly recommend it.
B00821OX98|4.0|Interesting series. Hope they keep making in and it goes in a good direction.  Good acting and effects.  Can't wait for season 3.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|John Scalzi's Old Man's War is a terrific read. I was introduced to the book by a comparison made with Jason Hough, author of The Darwin Elevator. Of course, having loved that book, I had to try Scalzi, and am very glad I did.<br /><br />Scalzi postulates a future quite different than Star Trek with the (mostly) benign imperialism of the Federation. Here, we have the Colonial Union, which is anything but benign. It's not exactly the Empire in Star Wars, but it's also hardly a government worthy of its citizens.<br /><br />Which we discover along with John Perry, a 75-year-old Earther who exercises his option to join the Colonial Union's military rather than face a futile battle with old age back on Earth. He does not get what he bargained for, which is hardly a surprise because the Colonial Union is not exactly big on sharing information with backwards Earth and its citizens.<br /><br />Old Man's War and the rest of the books in the series were very difficult books to put down. Scalzi has an engaging writing style and is a master at telling a story and letting a plot unfold, limiting the reader's knowledge to that of the central characters. In some ways, the future Scalzi postulates is not far different than that you'd find in Warhammer 40K, and of course, it begs comparison to Starship Troopers - hardly a surprise being a homage to Heinlein.<br /><br />This is an excellent series and I would recommend it to any fan of military science fiction.
0920668372|5.0|My mom read this book to me when I was a child and it has continued to be my favorite book. This is definitely a classic. I have bought this book for several of my friends who are expecting and most recently for my sister.

0738737909|5.0|This deck and book set comes in a sturdy box with magnetic closure . This deck is a Rider-Waite clone.  The cards are stunning and are almost graphic comic in style. The Wand Suite is based on Turkish moors with the color so vivid, check out the  red and yellow on the Nine of  Wands. The Pentacles deck seems to be  based on ancient China again with vivid color, the green is striking and the Queen of Pentacles is breathtaking.The Sword suite seems to be based on Queen Elizabeth I featured especially as the Queen of Swords with her collar and red hair high on her forehead, the King of Swords seems to be King  Henry VIII her father. The suite of Cups is pure fantasy with the elven looking prince, the King of cups is amazing with his muscled legs with tattoo designs he is in mostly blue shades, very cool.  My favorite cards are the High Priestess, Queen of Pentacles and the Devil Card. The booklet is a good size 8 inches x 5 inches with the pages being glossy and is approximately 152 pages, there is a picture of each card and a description, it has a few  spreads as well.
0812982622|1.0|Compared to &#34;nothing to Envy&#34; this book was more than a disappointment. Who was narrating was often obscure. I thought the interrogator in bldg. 42. Was a female and had to be reminded he was a male each time he spoke. (I am reminded that 42 is the answer to the universal question in &#34; hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy: too cute) I'm 80 and an engineer; I just don't see the world like the literaty.

B004P1JDJO|5.0|I'm a Project Manager and have been always interested on team's behavior and motivation of high performing professionals. And after watching a couple of time Daniel's TED Talk, I knew I had to read his book. The book is easy to read, with engaging narrative that explains the underlying truth of motivation. The way is actually works, and should work. I am the kind of guy that passes on the good stuff and I found myself obligated to recommend this book to my friends, anyone that works in a team environment, and those that sometimes struggle motivating others.<br />I am convinced that this book, put in the right hands will &#34;supercharge&#34; the team performance, increasing levels of personal and profesional satisfaction, which I suppose is what everybody is looking for...
B003L77G6A|5.0|One of the funniest seasons in my opinion.It is  well worth the price i paid for and a must for all fans of the series
B000SEI230|5.0|I loved this book! As it seems I love all of Nicholas Sparks books. Something I would recommend to everyone!!
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|Concept seems good.  More of a long article than a book which is fine.  Table of foods with calorie counts is handy.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|I was worried about this show getting stupid after the end of the last season (Spoiler Alert!) when Debra found out what Dexter really was! but, sometimes they worked it out that it made sense and another great season was made. I strongly recommend this if you are a fan of previous seasons. Can't wait to watch the next!
B0041WVTBM|3.0|good for the entire family and very touching moments with your entire family. good acting and recommended for again for a family.
B0087ITBPC|1.0|Doesn't even begin to describe how bad this movie was and is!  Barbara Streisand should personally refund everyone's money from her fee.  Title gives the false expectations and potential for so much more.
B00846REIS|3.0|Easy read, the female lead somewhat predictable. There were Some funny punch lines. I did enjoy and would read sequel
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I just got a Kindle Fire HD 7\\".  I have multiple printers, one being an HP D110A which uses ePrint.  I can print to it from other devices.  But on my kindle... I keep getting an internal error.<br /><br />I have removed the app from the device, from the cloud, restarted the device, reinstalled the app, readded to the cloud, etc.  I've done all I can short of doing a factory reset of my Kindle which I don't want to do and should not have to do.<br /><br />I just got this thing set up and now they want a factory restore, per the various readings?  No way.<br /><br />So, 1 star... it does not work.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This has always been my favorite Christmas movie and I've wanted to read the book for a long time.  The book was wonderful and a very quick easy read.  I only wish I would have read it sooner.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini hooks the reader from the first paragraph with a fable and remarkable writing.  This story is engaging, endearing, and extraordinary as lives are woven together across generations.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|SO AWESOME AND AMAZING VISUALS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE AND VERY DEEP TOUCHING STORY THAT MAKES YOU WANNA WISH THERE WAS MORE TOO IT, SO GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES AT THE END BECAUSE YOU WILL CRY YOURSELF OUT!!!!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I ordered this standing case so I could prop my kindle up and I love that I can do it vertically or horizontally! My only disappointment in that is it doesn't stay put in the slots very well and the angle is still hard for me to see...but it's not a big deal because for 90% of my use it's perfect!  It's great to have my kindle shut off and turn on just by opening or closing the case too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is a remarkable writer. This story is wonderful, and the way he writes it is extraordinary. He makes the story come to life. I cried, laughed, was frightened, overjoyed. I look forward to reading more of his novels.

B000P0J0EW|2.0|I watched this film it has some problems, the main one is that it is to long. This film would have been better if it was shorter. This movie gives a fairly good take on prison life. I have seen better films then this, The only thing I liked about the movie was the ending, this movie has a great ending, to bad the rest of the film was as good as the ending.
B002VECM72|5.0|I really liked this movie. This movie has it all - sassy, sexy, emotional, adoring, and funny. Get it for your collection.
B007TK77QE|4.0|The book depicts life in a small English town and the characters are well portrayed.<br />The reality of life and human relations is shown &#34;in all its splendor&#34;.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I enjoy the game but recommendations would be to allow gifting to more than 3 friends a day. Also since you have no control over what egg you get I would like to be able to abandon my egg right away instead of having to wait 12-48 hours for it to hatch first. It is frustrating when your trying to get a rare dragon and keep getting the same one over and over. It takes days to keep trying. You have to wait for the dragons to breed only to find out you got the same dragon egg you already had. Then you have to wait for it to hatch. I also wish they would tell you what to breed to get new dragons. One goal is a diamond dragon, but it's parents are unknown. I still find myself returning multiple times a day to collect. On my phone I got a special for 1 week I could expand without mystic maps and clearing village was 75% off. That was great. But I didn't get that offer on my kindle. One of my girls did. The other 2 didn't. I also have dragons on my phone that I can't get on my kindle. Not sure why they are different.
0451205766|5.0|Just finished a complete word for word re-read of \\"The Godfather,\\" and once again left the book in awe.  --- I do believe that it is a vastly underrated novel, in terms of pure literary accomplishment, and that is unfortunate.  Few books I've read contain such a compelling narrative, such a rich and lavish vocabulary and so much skilled presentation of character and circumstance. ----- The novel works as literature on all levels.  --- What made it a blockbuster? I am still intrigued by that question.  Undoubtedly, it was the combination of a true family saga with the genuine backstory of organized crime.  ---  Stories of families -- of how they come to define themselves, and how they manage to survive -- are always potentially powerful.  And this is a story of an American immigrant family with a remarkable twist.  As for being the backstory of a great criminal organization, the book appeared at a time when America was more hungry for the \\"backstory\\" of its villains and heroes than ever before.  Today we take all those backstories for granted.  We're used to the comic book monster who weeps or the vampire who pours out his soul or the gangster who makes us cry when he's shot.  But when this book first appeared, the love of the backstory of the cliched villain was just developing, and the hyper-intimacy of the Godfather's portrait of thugs and murderers was stunning.  It was genius of Puzo to take the Italian Mafioso gangster, so often the heavy  in novels and and TV and  films, and tell the tale from his point of view, and the points of view of those who surrounded him and admired him, or even loved him -- his family, criminal associates and intimate friends.  With his profound insider knowledge of the Italian Mafia, Puzo revealed biographies, vignettes, customs, sayings, and \\"insider thinking\\" of undoubted authenticity to bring his novel fully alive.  --- Speaking of the Don as a great man, or a genius, without the slightest compunction to hedge his bets morally,  Puzo outrages and yet fascinates.  And his compassion for his created characters is endless, as he probes for the humanity in almost all members of his huge cast,  no matter how unappetizing the person might seem when first introduced. ---  As for the structure of the novel it is very simply brilliant.  Puzo keeps talking, keeps revealing, keeps explaining, keeps filling us in on this world of his as if it were in fact reality and he was merely answering our questions as he reminisces.  ---- Indeed the absence of a tight structure sometimes seems to enable him to make this a page turner of near unfathomable power.  ----  There are lessons to be learned in this book for any novelist, I think, no matter what that novelist's aims.  ---- I can't recommend the book enough to all.  Read it for pleasure, read it to learn about writing, read it to enjoy the profound story behind the dazzling Coppola films.  Read it to gain perspective on a certain time and place in American cultural development.  Doesn't much matter.  It is such a great book that it will never  disappoint.  And don't fail to note the beauty of the writing, the often graceful and lovely phrasing, and (again), the powerful and flexible vocabulary used so effectively over and over again to bring to life characters, moments, visual scenes.  A treasure.  I suspect this book is taught in some literature classes now.  It will surely be treasured as literature in years to come.  It was never just a \\"pulp\\" novel.  And no one should ever dismiss it as such.  When I finished it yesterday, my latest used  hardback copy was filled with notes, underlining, little flags.  I was so sorry that I had come to the end.  And all I wanted to do was start reading it all over again.uzo outrages and yet fascinates.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book and the next book Walking Disaster! I read them on my Kindle and then ended up buying paper backs as well!
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Actually, pretty good. Its a difficult story to tell because there are so many plot lines happening at once, across 500 years. It was exciting, emotional at parts, and overall enjoyable.
B001EN71CW|4.0|The show was, is, and always will be great!<br />This is the second time that this product had a damaged plastic cover. Damn you shipping.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|Very interesting but not as scientific as I thought it might be. I am currently on the diet [it fact it is a fast day today] and it appears to be working. Losing ~1 kg per week. The basic recipe ideas are OK for a start but need more ideas for the future.
B00CWV8X04|2.0|I thought this movie was going to be real good but I was very disappointed. It was very slow and made little sense in general. I really like Catherine Zeta Jones but there was very little of her.
8866137634|5.0|I love writing. I love writing in ink even more. I may even sketch stuff once in a while. This notebook allows me to do all that, with the added benefit that I can upload what I've done to Evernote and keep it forever. Then, once in Evernote, I can search for stuff I've written because their handwriting recognition only keeps getting better. Their mobile app (iOS) keeps getting better as well. All in all, it's a great buy, and I can't wait to fill the notebook I have in order to get another one.

B008Y73940|5.0|The movie was wonderful and McConaughey did a great job as the lawyer Mick Heller.  He followed the connelly book well!
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|The book dragged most of the way. The fantastic part about the early series was the unique characters. However, lacked depth. All the characters seemed the same. It did tie up all the lose endings but other than that wasn't great book.
B009L7MD44|3.0|The product works as it says it does but the instructions and very minimal and it took me a good 2 hours of setup to get it working properly. Also if you are expecting great transfer rates even with a usb 3.0 drive forget it. The transfer rates a very slow like around 54mps or less.
B005FOF3D0|5.0|I enjoyed this much more than 'the corrections&#34;. I'm not sure if it was the story, the telling, or the medium. I listened to this rather than read the hard copy. I thought the device of Patty's book within a book ties things together in an unpretentious and natural manner.  It  also smoothed the switch from 3rd person to 1st person smoothly and gave anoter person's view of the same events in a novel(to me and pun intended) way.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|this was a replacement, my first copy was step on and it cracked, I have all of the Res. Evil
B003FL4O9E|5.0|I love this movie! I'm not sure if it's truly awesome or all the nostalgia makes it awesome. Either way, it's a fun movie for kids of appropriate age
B00AW57L96|3.0|This book seems to take a long time to get to the point in just about every aspect.  Felt quite let down by the final outcome, not one I would recommend to others.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I actually clicked on the BINGO tab in error but since it downloaded I thought I'd give it a try. So far, haven't figured out how to use it but be advised, I am 82 and not the sharpest knife in the drawer so don't take my rating as accurate! I will try later to figure it out.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I loved this series, for at least five books. Charlaine Harris is a great writer, when she writes creatively. The problem with the series was the same as Eric's--it's hard to live when you're undead. I don't think Ms. Harris ever had this many books of plot for Sookie in her head. A publisher wanted as many as they could get.<br /><br />This is the sad result. I read another series that is suffering the same fate.<br /><br />I do not think Ms. Harris is to blame. Many writers do not get much money from those first well-beloved books, and only get bigger bucks from subsequent contracts. Unfortunately, by then, inspiration can be flagging.<br /><br />The last books reads like it was created by a committee of editing interns, with a thin volume of Harris to inflate. It finally became unreadable. Her early books I still can't put down, even after reading them several times. She is that good. This is not Charlaine Harris's writing. Some of it is, but a lot of it is some tortured committee project that has to \\"tie up all the loose ends in the series.\\" Or else. It reads like something written with an execution squad aimed at the room unless it was finished. No joy. No delight. More Sookie cooking and tanning to fill those 384 pages that make the stupid reader feel like plunking down her thirty bucks.<br /><br /> I cook. I clean. I don't want to pay to read about it. What I don't do is date sexy Viking vampires, Civil War undead. By the way, I never sleep with dogs. Charlaine, it just ain't sexy. You get fleas.<br /><br />If Sam could change into any animal, why a dog? Ain't to bright, is he? Which is why Sookie never, ever considered him more than a friend. She needed a new human/fae hybrid to come in the series around book five, live in Bontemps, and marry Sookie. But she forgot to invent one.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|This game I kinda cool. In order to have a good toon you have to put big money in the game.
B00000255F|5.0|This album is the breakthrough for Bruce Springsteen; and he finally creates a large sounding sweeping masterpiece.  It's also lyrically a transition between the first two albums, which celebrate New Jersey street life and the next two, which are about blue collar America.  The big sound and the vast lyrics together create a masterpiece akin to a Jack Keroauc novel.  Bruce's albums would never again be this exciting nor would they ever sound so free; but here the lyrics are for the first time sophisticated and the sound is magnificent.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use it every day to track my ebay listings. Easy to use,  great format,  I absolutely recommend this app to anyone! A+++
B005544V6A|5.0|This show is very entertaining and the two main characters play off each other perfectly. Looking forward to watching the other seasons!
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Very cute YA novel that still manages to provoke a mature response. Cried, laughed, smiled and lingered in my mind for days. Highly recommend.
B00BD62X14|5.0|I do not speak French but Carla's sweet voice and the language are a joy to listen to. I listen to the album over and over. It is relaxing and makes me happy.
B0054YH8DY|5.0|This is one of the duo's best.  The first side contains the story of a life surrounded by the \\"Bookends\\" theme.  The second has mostly songs intended for \\"The Graduate\\" (although only \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" made it on.)<br /><br />Lyrically both sides together deal with disillusionment of American commercial culture.  While that was in the spirit of the times, the messaged doesn't sound at all dated.  Paul Simon's lyrics still resonate today.<br /><br />The major problem with the album is that it's so short.  It clocks in under 30 minutes (35 with the bonus tracks.)  Albums this good shouldn't be that short, I can only wish there was more.
B00BMTX2QM|3.0|So, what's it like.<br /><br />Well, it's like this, somewhere between Forest of Equilibrium and Guessing Game. That's it really.<br />Oh, and skip the opening track. Lee Dee endlessly entoning \\"Bring Out Your Dead\\" in a manner that lacks scariness or Pythonesque humor.<br /><br />Buy - If you're a completist.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|All of these things.  Mr Russinovich makes make a fun read out of material (cyber security) most people find uninteresting and beyond their grasp, and he knows enough tech to accurately depict how this type of stuff can happen.  There are pearls of wisdom embedded in the story that will help many operate a little more safely on the Internet and perhaps spark an interest in cyber self defense, including indicators as to the magnitude of the threat.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Just when you think things are going to slow down they put in a tough but cool twist. Very Awesome.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I love this show. Yes, the concept is a little cheesy, but fun. The characters are great. It's not too deep but it's a good time.
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent writing! Similar to fifty shades yet different enough to keep me intrigued and cannot wait to start the second book! I was hesitant to read this series bc I loved fifty shades of grey...and didn't want a copycat experience....but this book is written much better (probably bc it is not Twilight fan fiction) I can't believe I'm admitting this but.....move over Christian Grey & hello Gideon Cross!!!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|item is very small, lightweight and stylish.<br /><br />I was able to charge my padfone 2 (2100mAh battery) fully 4 times. It is exactly as described. Every function works flawlessly. 2A charging port charges really fast.<br />I reccomend this product.
B000ID37T0|5.0|I loved this movie. The ordering process was very easy, and it was available for me to watch at any time. Great buy for the price.
0670023329|5.0|This really brings home the crushing, claustrophobic nature of the total camps in North Korea.  The main character was born in a total camp and raised in it till his escape to South Korea and finally America.  Not just his life in the camp but his escape are stunning and unimaginable to those of us who live in freedom and surrounded by loving family, knowledge, and beauty.
B004EI2NM2|2.0|Wow...No Way would I want to see this again.  Movie covers (1) night and it was chaotic at best to keep up with the craziness that was their acting and thought processes.  Definitely wouldn't recommend this one.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Some functionality has been lost from the online version (to be expected I guess) but still nice on the move!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|U can build your own little town,fight ,and collect your monsters.l love all the cute paper monsters. I 've never seen a game like this before.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This movie had a great story line. Other than the absurd and complete nudity in the first scene, it was well-written and presented a realistic, if not very much flawed portrayal of a man that many are familiar with. Denzel does what he does, and that is act his butt off. As always, he commands the screen, but is surrounded by a good supporting cast as well. The crash scene was done beautifully, and the movie did not disappoint from there.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great app.  Works very well with Galaxy S3.  Phone has never locked up.  Lots of good titles.  Highly recommend to other users.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Thrill ride with lots of action makes this game fun. Great for young and old alike. I highly recommend it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of those books that takes a piece of you when are you done reading it. Its hard to understand why everyone isn't reading it
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Very well done. Explains things in a way you may not have thought of. I picked this book because I love to cook.
0307450570|5.0|This is a great book lots of great idea. I would reccommend this to my friends the book is great.
0316069434|5.0|Like new, even the cover was perfect and had interesting feel to it. all pages when of good quality paper. top quality made book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|My family love's playing this game it's so much fun that my kids play this for hrs on end. Thank you for making such a great game. Keep up the great work!!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom never disappoints! His books always have me questioning my life and purpose. Wonderful! Thought provoking, and powerful. Loved it.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Great, lot of great music, all in one album, missing a few of his all time favorite,s.  Love it. Bob Seger
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's a great deal for a great saga.  I'd say this is a pretty basic pack that comes with the standard set of extra features on a separate disc from the movies.<br /><br />All-in-all I'm thoroughly happy and got what I paid for.
B000HC2LI0|1.0|The box set has a beautiful aesthetic, however, it is tragically flawed in functionality. Instead of cases for the DVDs, they packaged it in sleeves that are so tight they scratch the DVDs. Every disk I have checked so far is scratched. Very disappointing that such a good series is packaged with such low attention to quality.
B0082LUEW8|5.0|Pleased with this item. Came on time and gets played alot. My son is very pleased with this item. Glad we got it
B0041KKYBK|5.0|This film/documentary is something everyone must-see at least once in their lifetime. It shows how corporate greed rules America and continues to rule it even to its demise.
0891419063|4.0|Most of the books about WWII in the Pacific explore it from the 60,000 feet perspective, well at least 28,000 feet back then.  While the Old Breed documents the struggle from the grunt's perspective, the Marine huddling on top of the sharp coral because he is unable to excavate a foxhole.  If we had the draft today I doubt that very many could hack it.
B0053FANS6|5.0|I love these movies.  I like the cast and the acting, and it being blu-ray, I really like the quality as well.  This was an amazing deal for all 3 movies as well.<br /><br />Can't go wrong with this trilogy!
B0019O6IWU|4.0|I almost gave this 5 stars as this was helpful and inspiring to read, as a social worker and mental health clinician. It makes the clear case for the importance of understanding the feelings and unmet needs behind behaviors, and how one may clearly communicate what is upsetting to him/her and then make a specific request. I have so much respect for the author, for all of his contributions to peace, both at the micro and macro levels. The part that I still struggle some with is implementing it consistently throughout various situations and I'm not sure that it is just due to lack of experience, but maybe because there are some instances when rewards/punishment, praise, etc. are necessary, or at least helpful (although he clearly makes the case where he sees praise as appropriate). Still this book has lots of realistic and practical suggestions to learn from and as an ideal, I am striving to implement all of the ideas. Glad I read it and would recommend it to anyone, especially those in the helping profession.
B000065V42|5.0|I love this movie, I have owned this movie like 5 or 6 times but yes my kiddos ruined it.so this time there not touching it..lol<br />It came in the time they said it would arrive, is in excellent condition, cant wait to watch it :)<br />thanks
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was absolutely perfect. It was a sad and sweet love story. I'm in love with this book, there's no doubt about that.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Hoping they'll go for the record and keep this show going for many more seasons. Still creative, and still entertaining after all these years. Love Sam, Dean, Castielle, Meg, Bobby, Crowley, Garth, Kevin and all the players. Keep up the great work guys!
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Really the only reason why I wanted to see this movie was to see how Mila Kunis and Mark Wahlberg were together through this movie.  I'm usually a big fan of Seth MacFarlane's stuff as well but I couldn't get completely on board with this movie.  Every time the bear would talk, I would hear Peter Griffin.<br /><br />The story was okay too but I guess I'll say that you need to be really stoned to see this movie and completely enjoy it.
B009RH9FR6|3.0|It keeps my kindle safe, but I wish that the latches for the standing position worked better. Still worth it for the price.
193700788X|1.0|This book and the previous books were bad. I can not believe that I bought them. Hated the ending. It felt like Charlaine Harris just gave us all the middle finger.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Really funny and a really good book for anyone who is looking for some entertainment. I give it 5 stars!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This music just makes your day go by a little happier. If you are down, or things are just not working out the way you planned, turn on a little Fun.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|Touching portrayal of the \\"hereafter\\".  A great read that will stay with you long after the final chapters.  Highly recommended.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Excellent. Everything u need to know and no fluff. A must read before u start formatting ur ebook. Great resource for future
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Great book but it should be updated to fit culture but over all great book I would recommend to amny
B00CHS31DG|2.0|I purchased Legacy, then was told try this.  Nothing has happened and I lost 199 coins for something I thought I could've used on my KFHD 7, but seem to not be able to see.
B0052FG750|4.0|I'm complete new to The Doors (I was actually)so I decided to buy this set to check them out. The music is outstanding, no doubt about that. The only things that are bothering me are the replica sleeves and little information about the songs. The cardboard sleeves aren't really protective and may leave marks on the discs after a long period of time. As a newcomer (Where I suppose this boxset is aimed for) I would have liked to have some more information on the albums/songs. All you get is a 16-page booklet with the lenght of the songs on each album. There are no lyrics for example. But overall it's a nice set.<br /><br />If you're looking for a cheap way to own all the albums of The Doors, get this set. If you have the money, look for the Perception boxset. There you have all the lyrics and information you might want to have.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|It took me a while to get started on this series, bit now I'm hooked! Plus I'm watching the HBO episodes at the same time, so I get to compare them to the books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game so much. I find it very fun and stress free, its also good for your brain gets it thinking.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|It's easy, free, smooth working (used on a Kindle Fire), and even allows color coding. A must for anyone needing something quick to plan a day, a week or even events in months away! Definitely great for long term assignment planning, meetings, important dates, and scattered events. Try it! You won't be disappointed:)
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was  AMAZING, for me at least. It was more of a pretentious novel so it made you think a lot, the extra thinking was actually fun for me. But regardless of its amazingness this book is definitely for a very mature audience.Because of the this book's high a and point in maturity you need to know who you are before reading it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I loved this book. I really felt for Victoria...she had a rough go of things but she was strong and willful, really just a great character. There were many great characters and the plot moved right along.. almost too quick of a read, didn't want it to end! I also learned a lot about flowers and their meanings! Highly recommended.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Masterpiece Theater: If you enjoy a good story across classes with two pinches of romance all set against a historic backdrop, you will appreciate this as much as I have a few times already.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book is a beautiful story about a group of people that run for the joy of it....and do it at speeds I can barely comprehend!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a very enjoyable game. I hope that there is gonna be a sequel. The ending made it seem like there will be. I just hope that it is very soon and is as enjoyable as this one.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I needed it for my 6yr old and 3yr old granddaughters. it was perfect and the girls love that they have a case for their kindles.
B00APJLEGA|4.0|One of the recent animated movies that the kids can watch over and over, and over.  And, the quality was good as well.  I recommend it for families, and families that stream movies on WiiU or Xbox360.
B006Y5H74W|2.0|I love this show.  I watched every episode from season one and have watched every episode of season two except for the last one.  It is still on my DVR and I want to savor it; it ended too soon.<br /><br />Given the fact that season one is not yet available in Blu-Ray, I purchased the entire season at Amazon Prime only to find out that the $30.00 I was charged for season one in HD was not in HD at all.  It was easy to tell by the noticeable lack of sharpness and detail in the picture and my A/V receiver, which even tells me what type of sound (Dolby Pro-Logic II, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital+, Dolbt Tru-HD, etc ) is being provided by the program material indicated that the sound was only Pro Logic II.  The was a blatant rip off, only compounded by the fact that it has all since become available free for Amazon Prime subscribers.  This is what it is worth: nothing - nothing, that is, beyond the subscription price, a subscription I have made good use of and will continue to do so.  I am just angry and disappointed that something was misrepresented in this way.<br /><br />And yeah, I am a crazy enough fan to purchase both seasons on Blu-Ray, once they become available.  Amazon Prime, in this one instance, did me wrong.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Purely from a literary perspective, I think that Wool is mediocre at best. While it has a powerful story behind, the story telling is ridden with flat characters, dull dialogues, overuse of elements (don't get me started on the stairs), and some very boring parts (I am looking at you, book 2 with Jahns and Marnes).<br /><br />However, we can't deny that it is a hit and lots of people really liked it. So, there must be something to it.<br /><br />One of the reasons why I think Wool was such a hit, is because the story is told in a format more resembling a TV series than a book. Examples:<br /> - Flat characters that don't really evolve along the story. Instead, their past is shown in flashbacks so that you can understand a bit more of them.<br /> - Dull dialogues.<br /> - Multiple stories being told concurrently, which take place in different places and/or times. Some of them just to keep you wondering what happenned, than to really add to the plot or thesis.<br /><br />It seems to me that the author learned to write by watching the \\"Lost\\" series rather than by studying classic literature. I don't necessarily think this is bad, I just think it is interesting and probably a sign of modern times.<br /><br />So, rounding up, while this book is definitely not a gem of literature, I think it will turn into a reference case for the future for two reasons:<br />1) The story was crafted from a \\"watch\\" rather than \\"read\\" perspective, which could be a trend.<br />2) The publishing model with the author followed: first self published as ebook through Amazon, then sold the rights for TV/movie and then sold print-only rights to a book publisher (once the TV or movie is out, the print book will surely be a best seller).
B0015AARJI|1.0|Marketed as in very good condition, I thought I would be able to save money and get a similar quality controller. However this was not the case, the L2 and R2 buttons jam frequently often in the middle gameplay, R2 doesn't actually return to it's natural position as it should. The right and left sticks both bug out occasionally which is insufferably annoying. I feel very well ripped off and disappointed.
B0018CVQFM|3.0|Honestly , I like Nash, liked him with the Hollies, CSN, CSNY, and CN, and solo. His singing, and pop hooks made a lot of his early songs fun, his collaborations with Crosby, and some great bands (Garcia, Wind on the Water Band, etc) made some of his songs timeless.  There is a BUT here,  he just didn't really have enough great or even good songs after the CSN album to warrant the third disc in this set.  The Hollies material should have been expanded, since its difficult to have a real feel for Graham's work from only three songs. Remember Neil's 'Decade' album , it starts off with a bunch of Buffalo Springfield, same should have been done here.  My other recommendation would have been to include Songs For Beginners in its entirety, it's his one real winner solo album, that every should own.  Love Graham, but 3 CD's is like a 5 or 6 record set, way too much for Graham.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Need it to finish the series, the first two books are by far the better of the three. Thank you
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The best book I've ever read!! I can't wait to read the next book! I loved it! Lol more please

B000FBFMZ2|5.0|I read this when it came out, and was an instant Morgan fan. I decided to re-read it now and no disappointment. Action packed. Interesting premise. And a great lead character, no matter what sleeve he's in.
B00A7W29BE|2.0|I don't see how this is scanning a document...it's basically taking a photo. It was free, so i can't complain too much
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|Great book, great insight not only on the incredible bravery of these pilots but what it takes just to fly one of those things.  In my opinion, they really can't be flown.<br /><br />Highly recommend this one!
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|Intrigue and suspense all together!!!! I love this book I will recomend it of course.I will buy more books from Kate Morton

B00CW665VI|5.0|Oh wow..loved, loved this book!! I couldn't put it down..it was so unique to read Drew's point of view..at first..not so sure I thought too much of him..but then, of course, fell in love with him just like Kate!! Underneath all the bravado, he is sweet and loving..I couldn't stop laughing with his referrals to his sister. Kudo's to the author for bringing a new and refreshing romance novel. I can't wait to read Twisted. Thank you Emma for bringing this story to life for me!!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My 30-year-old brother-in-law turned my son onto this game and he hasn't stopped playing it for the past two weeks. I guess that means he likes it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This app is the best app if you are looking for a fun app this is the one if i could rate this app from one to ten it would be ten
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|It's easy and fun game for a child. Epic is a Good game for a kid. I think if you get this game your kid will love it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|found this game to be enjoyable and fun. was nice to find s game that I like to play on my kindle.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The story was okay, and although you could anticipate what was coming next, you were always wondering why he was the way he was.  The writing was not too good.  It felt like the author had a list of what needed to be included in a good story in front of her, and had to keep adding those things in, even if they did not really fit.  An example would be the &#34;fifty shades of this,&#34; &#34;five shades of that,&#34; &#34;twenty shades of the other,&#34; etc.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is now one of my top 10 favorite kindle fire HD . If you don't get this game, you are a person who hates fun, games, happiness and sunshine. So BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
