B008UCJ7KO|2.0|A bit disappointed that this was not the conclusion of the story we were promised.  These types of relationships get a bit tiresome after awhile so I find it had to believe that the rest of the story will be anything but more of the same.  Not sure I'll read the next book unless I get it for free.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|My son has watched about 10 times<br />and he's at the age where he's to cool for little kid stuff
B009NG1Q96|5.0|After finishing this one, I totally could see this as a series on MTV or the CW, went to the website and found out that it was passed on an advance. Damn, someone needs to option these books and make a movie! As page-turning as The Selection, loved how it moves along, great hurdles and challenges that didn't make feel like &#34;aww, c'mon!&#34; I cannot wait for the final book --not due until 2014--sad, but I have patience!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Just as good as the theatre, video and picture were great. Glad I get to watch it over and over !
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 was wonderful with all the twist and turns of the previous seasons.  I can't wait until I can see Downtown Abbey Season 4!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love this game. I have it on my phone and now my Kindle. Very addictive and a good way to pass the time.
B00BU18U82|4.0|Awesome game but 2 things I do not like are if u go under a silo a nd did not put anything in it it will still give u that product and number 2is u have to buy half o' it with real cash.
1476733953|5.0|I have to say, I rarely write reviews.  But the Wool book series is fantastic.  It is imaginative, positive, has great character development, and grows (in size and depth) as the book number rises.  The author should be proud and well rewarded for giving this to the science fiction community.  Many thanks!
B008383GE8|5.0|A very clear and very interesting outline of a complicated subject, which is being discussed by more and more by amateur sky-gazers and evolutionists. The author maintains interest by presenting quite complicated physics in an easy  and comprehensible manner. Having read the book, I can now appreciate the concept of the 'big bang&#34; and have a notion of our place in the Universe. A book well worth reading!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun and entertaining game. The graphics are excellent, and the action is nearly non stop. The Minions are as comical as they are in the two movies. This game is appropriate for adults as well as children.
1476733953|5.0|I was hooked from the first page! It's really a great book and very interesting story. I love sci fi and this was exactly that! Can't wait to read more
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book because of the author's weaving of the various characters and generations of the family.  His descriptions were so vivid and moving.  Although, with some characters it took a page or two to identify who they were, this was another wonderful technic when the reader realized who the story was about.
B008469DGY|4.0|Fun little flick target game - it would be better if you could choose clubs - at times it shanks for no reason - not unlike real golf
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Not many books have had me enthrall from beginning to end... This one is one of the few that has.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was disappointed that she is dragging this out for future books.  I loved the first 2 books and enjoy the complicated relationship that Gideon and Eva share but this 3rd book was kind of a disappointment.  Too much sex and not enough story content.  I am not interested delving into some on the other characters.  I am ready for this story to be tied in a neat bow and the story lines just keep dragging on and it's becoming very predictable.
1490313370|5.0|Extremely inspiring and was the backbone to my current success and motivation. No, thank you Mr. Altucher. Keep on producing my man.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A personal look into the lives of Afghans in a way I would never have known or experience. A wonderful and enjoyable book. I highly recommend it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is a very well written book with avery compelling story. There are a number of stories going on at the same time that intertwine many characters.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|this was a very good book, but there are several different storylines throughout the novel and one in particular was impossible to read.  The language was hard to read and it was boring.  I skipped it altogether.  I saw the movie and it doesn't appear I missed very much by skipping that one boring section.  The rest of the book was very good.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Thanks for the wonderful dvd.  We have watched this show several times and it never gets old.  This is a very  inspiring movie to us because we have a child in our family that is autistic and is very smart but hard to understand sometimes.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is casual RPG Tower Defense at it's best.  I've played through the campaign and there is still much to do as there are extra difficult levels to beat as well as the challenges on each stage.  I rarely pay for time waster apps, but this was worth it.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|I found this soothing to fiddle with in off moments.  It is like rubbing your finger through different colored finger paints and making designs.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I get it, he's a wallflower... But the main character's apathy was so extreme that it made the character unbelievable.  not a bad book though
B00005RDRO|5.0|You not only get Peter Sellers in this one, but a whole myriad of comedic talent. Nancy Walker steals the show as the deaf mute cook!
0062255657|5.0|\\"I make art, sometimes I make true art, and sometimes it fills the empty places in my life. Some of them. Not all.\\"<br /><br />The book begins like this. A grown man tells you what he is wearing, and from this, you understand. This is the aftermath in the death of a loved one. Though he's expected back at his sister's house, he can't bear to go back, to field the questions and catch-up conversations he knows he will be holding with people he hasn't seen in years. Instead, he goes for a drive, past the childhood home that isn't there anymore, down a street that becomes a gravel path and ends at an antiquated farm. There, he gets out of the car. And begins to remember.<br /><br />As I read this, tears burned my eyes and threatened to go over. Once or twice, they probably did. If you have ever been a particular kind of child--a child who maybe didn't quite fit in, or quite meet her parents' expectations in one way or another, a child who preferred reading books to playing sports, or who had birthday parties other children didn't come to--well then, this book might make your heart hurt a little, too.<br /><br />So, the plot. When the nameless author is seven, a boarder comes to stay at his house, accidentally running over the boy's beloved kitten. The next morning, the boarder's body is discovered, dead, in the family car, in a farmer's field, not far off down the lane.<br /><br />The boy is sent off to the farmhouse for a short time while the police investigate. As he waits, he meets the Hempstock women; Lettie, who has been eleven for a very long time, her mother and her grandmother. To his astonishment, they already know about the incident, who was involved, and why the boarder killed himself. Something from another, ancient world has accidentally awoken.<br /><br />The older women dispatch Lettie to repair the damage. When she brings along the boy, who sees something he shouldn't, does something he shouldn't, and unintentionally transports something from the pagan,pre-history world into the real world, off we go.<br /><br />This book is the best kind of magic, the kind you read and recognize as a fairy tale version of our own lives, and our own hard truths. And so, the monster in \\"The Ocean at The End of the Lane\\" is not evil in the way we have come to expect from horror movies; she is just trying to give people what they want.<br /><br />She puts money in a poor woman's purse, which results in the woman's husband suspecting her of prostitution. A father secretly desires the family babysitter, so the monster allows him to have her. A man is furious with his son, so angry he could kill him...<br /><br />But this was the most frightening truth; being all-grown-up doesn't automatically make anyone responsible, mature, considerate, unselfish, kind or wise. Most grownups--and terrifyingly, this means most parents--are pretty much just older versions of whoever they were at seven. And if this doesn't scare you, nothing will.<br /><br />With grace and great force, the story circles back to where it started, to ask the biggest question of them all; what happens after death? Are our loved ones really gone, or watching us from somewhere? Do they still care about us? Will we ever see them again?<br /><br />I don't know how much of this haunting story stands in for a memoir of Neil Gaiman's life, and how much is fiction. It certainly feels like truth disguised by beauty. Whatever the case, this achingly powerful little book, which begins with the familiar experiences of childhood and grieving, transforms them both into allegory, metaphor, fable and fairy tale--and then back again.<br /><br />I recommend this to everyone with all my heart, but it would be an especially good place to start for someone who has never read Neil Gaiman before.
B0068THAGY|4.0|Truly an okay movie.  One you can sit down and watch just to escape ever day life.  Was a good watch.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Such a great book.  I loved it.  Havent read a book so good in a while.  As usual, the movie did not capture the essence of the book but I expected that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great game I would recommend this for all ages it shows a lot about horses training and the horses care
B00395ZYVS|5.0|What a beautiful story.  I enjoyed the book very much.  It is so hard to believe what happens to a girl child.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very addictive game and not impossible or simple either!!  It will make you think and have to remember things...but, it needs more levels SOON!!  LOVE IT THOUGH!!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Had this app on my phone for years. At least 3. Installed it when I got my kindle (about a year-and-a-half ago). Loved it. When they updated to the new format I used it for a month before I uninstalled it altogether. I left it on my kindle because it was still the same format that I liked. Guess what I woke up to this morning when I went to check the weather on my kindle? The new format is very User unfriendly. Seems like they tried to go with looks rather than functionality. 3.5 years of having the weather channel app on one or more of my mobile devices has come to an end. I will be uninstalling this app right after this. Very disappointing.
B005XN0SGU|5.0|This app is perfect for reading comic books and etc! I recommend this app to any comic lover with a kindle fire! Definitely worth the price
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book has so much debth.  The main character has had such a bad childhood and restores herself through something that turned her on.
078401213X|4.0|I must admit that I'm glad to have not paid full price to see this film in a theater, however, this is a movie that fully intrigued me. As I was viewing this odd flick, I kept thinking to myself that this is a film \\"that I MUST purchase for Daniel\\", my engineer nephew - a young man so in love with NUMBERS.  For anyone passionate about theory, numbers, the science of life, 'Pi' is a must see.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game since the new update came up  it is a great game and you can play with other kids
B003O86FMW|3.0|Liked the book and read I  in a week but not as captivating as the first one.  Looking forward to reading the next installment.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I would like to rate the books I read, but don't feel I need to write a review on every one of them in order to do so.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Loveed it so much, I decided to share with my Mom. So many tears and laughs.  Would watch again and again.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The book started off with a depressing event and ended with one too! I enjoyed all of the characters and how they were linked. I couldn't wait to see how things turned out, I just love her style of writing and how developed her characters are. Can't wait for her next book whatever it may be.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|for some reason it wont let me download, its on my kindel fire and its dumb, but its pretty cool<br />.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|Was a daily deal.. so got for free.. wouldn't buy.. is easy to figure out and maneuver.. and very short.. only a few tracks
B000I9VZJ8|1.0|Unbelievable.  First I want to know who read this script and thought it should be a movie.  Second I want to know why I wasted the time to watch it (though I didn't make it to the end).  There is nothing redeeming about this movie.  Nothing.
0060987464|5.0|I wanted to read this book about Manson to get some more insight on his childhood and what got him started into being such an awesome and unique celebrity!!! I love this book!! If you want to know more about Manson and his life, this is a definate read!! The end has a special section where some of the famous rumors about him are clarified!!
B007V5CF5K|1.0|I had no problem with the trial game since I found it remarkably good. However I purchased full version on amazon digital 3 days ago and although the order was confirmed and charges acknowledged, up to now I have not found it in my Apps for download even though I restarted the device several times and refreshed numerous times- the help tab was not useful in determining whether I did something wrong. I had to resort to purchasing the other versions that were available.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Thought with all the hupla about Bubble Witch.. that it would be better then Bubble Birds.. etc.. is exactly the same and there is no challenge.. just line up shoot n done..
B006885FZI|4.0|Gritty...rough...and another classic that rivals Band of Brothers.  Overall great movie, though it is slightly less intense as Band of Brothers.  Recommend.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I love the movie Fight Club and will watch it over and over again. I decided to read the book and loved it too!!!
B003SJ6W4I|5.0|Very cute family movie. It's funny and entertaining, keeps you laughing. My kids loves it. Brendan Fraiser and Brooke Shields were good choices for this!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This book is great. I was hooked from the first page. Even though this book is over 100 years old it is still one of the best I have ever read. I think dracula was an amazing story when it first published and it still is today and I believe people will continue reading for a hundred more years. Dracula is good for all ages and is truly a classic. I recommend this book to everyone. Thank you Bram Stoker
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is funny & fun to play my daughter says. They like knocking down all the characters and buildings in the game.
0060989157|5.0|This is my all time favorite biography!! The writing style is unique. They tell different stories throuhgout the book but get all 4 of the Crues prospectives on things. I tell everyone to read this book. It is well written and has very entertaining content as well.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Great movie. It was so nice to enjoy a movie without profanity. The movie was enjoyed by everyone. An awesome family movie.
1416550550|5.0|Love this book.  Have never read anything by Kate Morton before and this was a great introduction to her work.  Better late than never!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Wish there were more episodes! Too bad Fox cut it off. Great ensemble cast, plenty of comedic and witty one liners at just the right moment.  Well done Joss Wheadon and team!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Finally!  Validation of quietness as a reasonable way to be in the world!  Well written and researched.  A worthwhile read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Hard to get excited about  a calculator app but this one does all I need.  Could not ask for more and very happy  and use the app often.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy this app and is a really good way to pass time.it's challenging and very fun for anyone
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard but makes you think. Enjoyed a lot..like having to put objects together. Like that each level gets a little harder.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Well made. User friendly. I have been playing magic for several years and this game is on par if not better then the xbox live digital game(s).  The actual TCG of course is better but this is very enjoyable.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This has been my favorite in the series. I could not put it down. I found the love story to be beautiful and was so glad for the male leads end result.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion rush so muchit is the beat. if you like temple run you will love this game it is evenxbetter then temple run
1780721676|3.0|It was redundant. I felt the authors were expecting readers to have difficulty understanding the concept. Regardless, my husband and I have started the program fasting two days a week.<br /><br /> I also would like to say that I have ordered many books from different sources via book postage and none( not one) of them took so long to arrive.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a great game. Many levels and great challenges. Great time blocker with many chances to improve your time or earn more stars.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Pretty good gAme, all most as good as the maps in tf2. I'm impressed.<br /><br />Just wish there were more maps
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game to kill time. Kids love it too. Whenever I want to pass time I pick my coin dozer app
0425263924|5.0|when will the next one come out? waiting on pins and needles. hope the sequel comes soon and with his perspective
B002XXNSF6|5.0|A wonderful movie with great dialog and interaction of two maturing young adults sharing a moment that could have been forever....
B008F5Y7UQ|4.0|This movie is about a billionaires dream and how it sparks a romance. This is a movie that will surprise you, in large part because the actors are better than you'd expect for a film like this. It's an original and interesting story that holds you until the end. The ending is a little to predictable and abrupt but it works fine.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|What can I say Michael Moore speaks truth again, great Christmas present for any lover of Michael Moore. Came in excellent timing and brand new.
B000002UUH|5.0|This was one of my favourite LP's and very pleased to be able to listen to it again on CD.  Beautiful!
B000HKWCOA|5.0|It took me years to come to terms to watching this series, however, once i watched it, I fell in love.
B001K3KK0Q|3.0|While this is probably true to the book, in the end it's just a so-so movie. Lot's of big actors and they all are competent but that's about it. There are a lot of times where you felt like you just missed something as the story jogs around.
B002JH3TW8|4.0|I don't have the opportunity to use this much, but when I do it works as expected. If you need this conversion, this works perfectly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was such a fun game! It wasn't too hard but it wasn't so easy either! The new levels need to come out soon! Can't wait! I highly recommend getting this game. You won't regret it.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I am not a follower of Katy but I do like some of her songs.  This film really shows how she became to be a pop star, her quirkiness, and her involvement in her brand.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I would recommend d to anyone who followed the show.  Looking forward to the next one & will purchasr it
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod Stewart never makes a bad cd<br />he is jus as good now as he ever was and will be
B002L3ARRU|4.0|This is such a fun &#34;kids&#34; movie. But there is so much bad language in it :( I really wish there were some &#34;alternative audio track&#34; option for this kind of thing.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|If you like capt jack on dr who, you should enjoy this series..... Hope it comes back. It's got interesting characters
6304083769|2.0|The audio was fuzzy and only played out of the left channel, it also made strange noises when rewinding, was difficult to insert into the VCR.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I downloaded this to the Kindle for my daughters and they both really enjoy it. It's very appropriate for their ages (10 and 7) and I don't have to worry about them seeing content that they shouldn't. No dramatic changes from previous releases but lots of fun none the less.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Goodwin is a really adept writer, and this subject matter couldn't be more significant--and relevant today.  It is so worth reading.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Did not find this entertaining at all.  I found Franco to be the wrong actor of the part.  Didn't draw you in to the story.  Very overacted.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love it but ay first it was moving slow and it also takes alot of space but it's worth it
B007N85POS|4.0|I downloaded this to the Kindle for my daughters and they both really enjoy it. It's very appropriate for their ages (10 and 7) and I don't have to worry about them seeing content that they shouldn't. No dramatic changes from previous releases but lots of fun none the less.
1433523930|5.0|The commentary is thorough and informative.  While it is quite large, I find it wonderful for deep study and daily Bible reading.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This was my second time watching.  Very entertaining.  Good characters development and story line.  Actually better the second time around.  Looking forward to DM2.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A VERY well written book, intelligent, couldn't put it down and was surprised all along the way.  Thoroughly realistic and enjoyed every second of it.  Similar writing style to Scott Turrow and a really great story.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I downloaded this to the Kindle for my daughters and they have both really enjoyed playing it. It's a clever twist on the Angry Birds games since you see things from the pig's perspective instead. Definitely age appropriate for my daughters who are 10 and 7.
0788859544|5.0|My daughter asked for the DVD for her birthday, couldn't find it anywhere, only pre-orders for October :( Very happy with product, came factory seal :) Hope to order more in the future!
B0083H6AQA|5.0|I am a Robaholic.  I freely admit it.  I love Rob Pattinson, and I'm probably his oldest fan, in years, anyway!  This was somewhat difficult to get locally and the movie never showed any where near my home.  I live near Atlanta, and it didn't even play there.  I was so glad I found it on Amazon at the price I got it.  Thanks, Amazon!!!!!
B000JMKTLO|2.0|Good descriptive writing but not much of a story, not very plausible and like her other novel Gone Girl, seems like author lost interest in the story and just wrapped it up quickly, poorly and with no imagination.  Skip them both.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I wish they decided to go through with the tv series, this would be a good one!  If you like Divergent you will like this!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great story. Loved the characters and the story was so full of emotion. Best book I have read this year.
B0058YPL66|5.0|My wife and I are not usually into fantasy or science fiction but we really like this show. We only watch shows on DVD and when we started this it was hard to stop. The characters are wonderful and interesting. There is plenty of mystery and suspense. It is an excellent show.
B008IEFJAQ|5.0|Songs, lyrics, and music are Maroon 5 all the way.  Exceeded expectations.  Would definately recommend this to any Maroon 5 fan.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|it wasnt my favorite but it was cool. I normally like drama and this was all action.  a solid c
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game, great graphics, intriguing puzzles, highly recommend this game for all puzzle lovers, was very sad when the game was over wanted it to keep going and going can't wait for the next one to come out.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|I avoided this show because of the cover, assuming it would be full of racy scenes but someone recommended it so I decided to give it a try. Now my wife and I both really enjoy the show. There is little bad language, few sexually overt scenes and provocative apparel is seldom seen and has no influence in the show itself. The stories are well done and interesting and the acting is excellent.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Well, Bond will never get quite as old fashioned as \\"From Russia with Love\\", but for a modern Bond movie, this was very close. It was also courageous. The movie features a noticeably older looking Daniel Craig as Bond, a look that they took pains to sell by leaving the gray stubble of a beard on his chin in scene after scene. This Bond has been beat up, shot up, and literally left for dead. He's in no condition to go back into service. Only his willpower and experience recommend him as the choice to hunt down a dangerous threat to MI6 itself.<br /><br />The adventure itself is gritty and at times disturbing, as a former MI6 agent with surprising resources seeks vengeance over an old score. His beef is not with Bond, but Bond is what stands between the traitor and unthinkable crimes against British Intelligence.<br /><br />The Blu ray presentation is top notch. Sound and picture blend perfectly together to allow yourself to forget your TV and become immersed in the story. It's too bad that it looks like we have to wait until 2016 for the next installment.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1781162646|5.0|its 1973, a young man working over the summer on the North Carolina coast at a small amusement park.  Amazing storytelling from a modern master
B005K17RU0|2.0|Although this purports to be accurate, it has been way off for weeks.  It has forecast storms when radar (over my home location) shows nothing within miles.  Last night it was showing fair, barely cloudy weather even while it was vigorously storming outside.  Even allowing for the lag in update timing, it couldn't have been further off.  The radar maps are marginally useful, but only just barely.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I have used the free eBooks app a few times now and it works well Down load can take a little time.<br />I select the book I want, usually late evening and in the morning it's there.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewels Star is an engaging game that can be played at many levels.<br /><br />It combines simplicity and the ability to strategize.  This combination makes it easy to learn yet, because of the strategies available, you can buy it, start it, and GO!...yet you can find yourself two hours later still highly involved in the game.<br /><br />If you choose not to go full-on strategize mode, and are not concerned with your score, Jewels Star has a lovely hypnotic quality which makes it quite relaxing to play. I play Jewels Star before sleep at night because it doesn't interfere with going to sleep...unless I am going for the high score.
B004HX0P2Y|4.0|Good Movie, the acting and wonderful old actors seemed to really be enjoying themselves.  The dialogue was never dry, fun to listen too. I gave it 4 stars because at the end it drug for about 10 minutes, like they were not sure how to end the movie.  But beside that it is worth watching.
0307477479|1.0|I really hated it.  I stopped reading after fifty pages and gave it away.  I think it is for a much younger person
B0091REZMW|1.0|Terrible game.  Wish I had never downloaded it.  Would not recommend it to anyone. Not worth my time or anyone else's time
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Excellent. I have learned a lot. What to do and what to stay away from. I am so glad I purchased this book. I have already noticed a huge improvement in my strength gains while strictly following the diet plans. I have been following the diet for a month in a half and his workout guide for approximately two months. MUST READ!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good until they made me review in order to continue to play. I love free apps. The cat ran fast.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|a very good game just as good as original needs more guns possibly a bazooka or grenade other than that it is amazing
125000098X|5.0|Six of us are reading these books and can't wait until the next one is available.  One of our group is from England and is very familiar with the places referred to in the books.  They have truly gripped us in the &#34;tangled webs we weave.&#34;
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Very good movie! It kept me thinking outside of the box and wondering what is going to happen next. Never a boring scene
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is a great show! &#34;Riding through this world, all alone.... the crow flies straight, a perfect line&#34;
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book, was about what happens to children when they have cancer. What happens after the person you love dies. And that is a great book. I loved it. And I am thankful that John Green wrote this book. Thank you
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Nice It worked very well and is informing,Also to tell the percent you are at was brillant I never regret downloading this app recommend this to everyone.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It works great, is easy to use and is convenient to have on my Kindle.  What more is there to say?
B00000633N|1.0|Specifically ordered this to be the remastered/Re-issued version.  Instead I received the original 1988 version which I already had.  Gave this away as a gift so now... I can't return it.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book but found the footnotes somewhat distracting.  The characters were funny and charming, and the plot moves along at a good pace.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|This album is a different style for a megadeth album, but it still has elements of heaviness in it and also some elements of melody.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I enjoy being able to go back to the game I was playing and not have to start over. It always challenges me and it a relaxer for me.
B00BOXZAG6|2.0|The story was really lame.  Seen it a million times.  May as well called it Twilight.  Really, if you are into that, you'll love it.  My wife and I found it lame, boring, predictable and stupid.<br /><br />The 3D effects were nothing special and they really did not take advantage of that tech.  The visual effects were pretty cool, minus the 3D.  I had a real problem however with the inaccuracies of the story.  This is not really a spoiler as you learn this in the first 2 minutes.  There are 2 worlds, each with their own matter that CANNOT commingle - be KEPT in the other world.  It's actually the entire basis of the movie.  However, in scene after scene after scene you see walls, windows, clouds and rain in both worlds.  There would have to be a definitive separation (going by the storyline) on ALL of those items - on every item - and there is not.  That is just sloppy sci-fi.  Take a look at the office scene on the cover even.  There MUST be a seam in the windows (and walls) where one world's glass meets the other world's glass.  There is not!<br /><br />I know, I'm being picky.  But hey, when your entire story hinges on the FACT that NO matter from one world can live in the other world and you constantly make this visual mistake all throughout the movie, I gotta call FAIL.<br /><br />So:  Story is boring, 3D is lame, visuals are pretty cool, neat sci-fi idea executed poorly.  Waste of time soon to be forgotten.
B0000X61UU|4.0|I am happy with this purchase!  It's brand new and just like I remember having before!  I am happy that it came so quickly!
B002QYNIHU|3.0|The neck on this has terrible support and it is hard to move the legs around in all this is OK but for playing uses it is USEFULLL
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|Good family entertainment.<br />Action and humor.<br />Music and background noises don't overpower the conversation so you cannot hear what is being said.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great fun keeps ya hooked don't have to spend money to have fun however without tokens you cant revive at last stop in game.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|This is a classic. My teen boys have been enjoying old episodes of MacGyver.  Great family entertainment. Thanks, Amazon, for making these available to your Prime customers.
B0089XH38M|5.0|Try'ed it so far it works great. Apps are new to me I am learning how to use them:-)  Thank you.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is a real page Turner. It really makes the reader feel as if he or she is apart of the demon slaying. Cassandra Clare is able to catch the readers attention in a way that while you're reading you loose track of time.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is fun and fairly simple. It is like Temple Run without the monkey chasing you. You can earn coins and buy upgrades to help you buy different penguins to run with.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book was great to read after watching the series on HBO The characters are given deeper background than what the television series can provide.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Having read Hosseni's first two books and being enthralled with them, I was looking forward to this book.  Frankly, it was okay but I did not find nearly the interest in this read as I had in his first two books.  I've read about 2/3rds of it, got boared, and never finished it.  Maybe one day in the future?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Works just how I want it to work and I recommend it to anyone looking for a bible app. God bless. :)
B006CBSE86|3.0|It's been about 11 years since Century Child, the last real good album from Nightwish. Their sound as evolved and Tuomas' lyrics will always be of the highest quality but the music overall has declined in quality. There is nothing really that separates Nightwish from most symphonic metal bands anymore. I listened to this and the previous albums and while there were sounds that stood out, there were no real masterpieces in there.
B000BISBDY|5.0|This is a nice collection of Johnny Cash's work, especially if you don't have any already.  The sound quality is very good and makes listening to his music that much more enjoyable.
B00065MDRW|5.0|I don't have more to add to the excellent reviews, except that this is a treasure worth discovering. Need I say more?
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|this is a great series. Love  the format. keeps my attention. Look forward to each episod. Keep this series going.
B00CVCHJ6I|5.0|Dark Tranquillity has always been a band to experiment with new concepts ever since they help pioneer the gothenburg sound back in the mid-90s. This album though is by far their greatest work yet since The Gallery. The album has the distinctive sound of DT but they tweaked it a bit. Very few bands are capable of experimenting and coming out with a masterpiece. Every single song on this album is a win. Not only that DT, which is known for producing high quality meaningful lyrics stepped up their game even more on this album. Tracks like \\"For Broken Words\\", \\"What Only You Know\\" and \\"None Becoming\\" will seriously have you pausing the song to think...The production quality of the album is also something I think has been under-rated from the other reviews I've heard. And Mikael Stanne's voice is as perfect as it was on Fiction. The last album I gave a 5 star to was Carnage's Dark Recollections. So that says something for this album....
B009NY43NY|5.0|Having read the entire series, this final book does a great job of wrapping up the story lines in a very satisfactory way.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I will definitely share my enthusiasm for Suits. Fun show to watch.  It is fun to watch multiple shows in one sitting.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Very good graphics and accuracy in forecasting future events. I use this app several time each day while traveling through so many micro climates here in the Bay Area.
B00DGXGUSY|4.0|There is nothing in particular that makes this album stand out. But Amon Amarth have always produced quality work, so this album was more like a regular day at the office (so to speak). All my expectations were met, no more, no less: crushing vocals (as expected), hair raising riffs (as expected), brutal and melodic (as expected). Though one particular track stood out \\"We Shall Destroy\\"....this is by far my favorite Amon Amarth song of all time. Is it better than their last album? Definitely. Could have been better? Yes. But it still rocks.
B00CEF014E|5.0|This book is the perfect summer read if you're at the beach, on a plane or anywhere as long as you're not alone!  The twist is as unexpected as it is shocking.  The characters in Solstice are believable, the pacing is brisk, the settings are spooky.  I read Stevenson's other book (The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada) and I'm not sure which is more fun.  I loved them both and cant wait to see what he comes up with next. Buy both these books now!
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|I think the &#34;Die Hard&#34; series has reached it's zenith.  I had hoped that this movie would not just stick with the usual jingo and totally unrealistic battle scenes, but it stuck with the same genre.  I think movie series like this one need to mature as they go along in order to stay interesting.  Bruce is getting old for this.  Jai Courtney is great and will be a big action star someday soon.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Can't wait for the new season to begin! Only wish the US would get to watch it when it begins on the British Network
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is an intriguing and very well made thought provoking game. I did not want to put it down but since I had to its nice that you can resume where you leave off. Very cool!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this story<br />and can't wait for the next book!  This series pulls you in and leaves you wanting more.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I was hesitant at first. But it came highly recommended. It took a few episodes to build the plot and characters. But it continually grew to become a well written and acted show that would surprise you. Great legal sparring.
B0081336FO|5.0|Season two continues the excellent writing/acting begun with the episodes of Season 1.  The tight story lines set in the present day UK coupled with the developing relationship of all the characters has each Episode build on it's predecessor.  While it's possible that these two seasons may be the close of this Sherlock effort I'm hoping otherwise!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Enjoyed the shows.  Good writing and acting.  Especially no commercials.  Watched an old episode on USA and had to sit through the commercials and it didn't flow very well.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|violence, killing, blood, lots of feelings, love, guiltiness, power.. the story is very well done and it feels real.. I just love it!
B005GIS1SY|3.0|There's a few too many \\"shut up\\" and \\"stupid\\" comments in the movie. Also had to explain a black market, and why people steal. The kids loved music, though.
0061438294|5.0|I knew some of the items you'll read about in this book. But once I started reading and put the info to use I only noticed more and more during my interactions with people.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Another great movie by Tarantino.  He just continues to push the envelope and succeeds.  If you are looking for a fun movie to watch I would recommend this one.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|A very interesting premise.  One feels great sympathy for the &#34;siblings&#34;... a different view of human-animal relations.  Very touching and sad.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Good game could play for a hot minute, i don't care to much for buying stuff though just like it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It was a great book continuing on the couples journey.  However, when I got to the end and realized another was coming out after this one, I was disappointed because it will be a long wait for the next one again!  Great story over all :)
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Need I say more about this.... It is action packed with a great storyline and has humor... a great movie
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|We thought it was really boring and did not finish it.  It was a waste of our money and time.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, I think it's a good family movie that all will enjoy.  Movie didn't get enough credit.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Not quite what I expected . It had a different twist to a usual love story. REally enjoyed it . would see it again
B003V1WTMM|1.0|Was emailed by Kindle to respond to complaint.  When I attempt to reply I get a message that it is not a valid email address.  So here is what I am trying to tell them:<br />It is very annoying to pay for an ebook and have so many pages missing.<br />I am not going to go back through an ebook, Distant Hours by Kate<br />Morton, nearly 600 pages to identify all of the missing pages.  There<br />were a couple in the 400's.  Most troubling was missing around 545-556,<br />toward the end which ruined it for me. Have to get a library copy to get<br />the gist of the ending.  A lot of money to pay for such deficiencies.<br />Also,. when I read Forgotten Garden there were a few pages missing.  At<br />what you charge I think you should have a decent proof reader for the<br />Kindle ipad version, which i use.  Want to download more but at this<br />point it's too great of a cost to miss major part of the story.<br /><br />I would think you would offer me a complimentary download, although I am<br />leery.<br /><br />Ginny Hronek<br /><br />On 7/7/2013 3:06 PM, Amazon.com Customer Service wrote:<br />> Hello,<br />><br />> Ive read your recent review regarding the Kindle 1st Generation e-reader, and I'm sorry for the difficulties you've experienced while attempting to read with your device.<br />><br />> For us to look into this error further, it would be helpful if you could provide some more detail.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun little games to pass the time when you are bored. you have to play the early games to unlock more games which can be annoying.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|This is a good family movie, how can you not like Dracula.  The dance scene I thought was awsome.  Another movie with not enough credit.
1423399978|5.0|Anyone who reads Nora Roberts' books doesn't need a good recommendation from me. She's great at mixing romance and intrigue all in the same story. None do it better. Don't forget to read JD Robb books as well. Even the guys can enjoy these.
B008602KQI|3.0|Plot and characters predictable with actors just acting - the only bright spot is Katniss.  Had to refrain from using the Stop button, just so I could confirm that it's mediocre all the way to the end of the movie.  Gave it 3 stars because 2 stars = don't like, which i couldn't select because the movie was ok.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just challenging enough. I was pleasantly surprised by this puzzle game. A great distraction and well worth the download. An excellent free app!
B00AEFXTKO|5.0|Our daughter worked for a local production but never saw the movie so we gave this to her for her birthday and she was very surprised by it and she loved it
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|It's nice to see a well done movie with actors over 25 years old.  It was heart warming.  Highly recommend it.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|The actors were good, but the Giants  got to be annoying. I didn't care for the CGI graphics throughout so much of the show.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Always love checking into Downton Abby. I enjoy watching the whole series as I do miss some episodes on pbs.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Exciting drama filled with scandal.  I love the legal stories along with the unpredictable story lives of the main characters.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|I love it because u can do alot with it &amp; u can. act like u doing something also its fun.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|What a combination of talent!  I love the CD with the new interpretations of old favorites.  Highly recommend to others who love refreshing music.
0345529057|5.0|These books do not disappoint! I am very happy that I bought this set. The price was great and I haven't been able to put them down!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this concept! Touch is a little sticky...won't always register. Maybe I have fat fingers. Would like to see more elaborate worlds and clues. Want them to be hard mentally, not because the touch doesn't register. Overall fun and good to think through.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|It is helpful since you can make a separate notebook for each topic. That said, it is not easy to reformat them. Nice as long as you don't accidentally put info into the wrong book. BUT - at least I don't have a zillion pieces of paper wandering around on my desk.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I love to listen to this man sing.  I have loved hearing him since he first appeared on the Ally McBeal show as a teen.  Such a gift.  I highly recommend his CD to anyone!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love it! So glad to be able to watch it this way.  Would purchase more shows this way. Thanks amazon
B003THHIEM|5.0|Castle is one of my all-time favorite shows! The first season may not seem like the best, but it's necessary foundation for the rest of the series, and every season keeps getting better. Like any early season, the characters are still trying to find their voices and really create themselves in the early episodes, but you'll fall in love with Castle and Beckett from the beginning.<br /><br />Amazon quality was great streaming through my roku. It's a super convenient and easy way to watch the show.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I have ttried and tried to get this to work but I cant. I downloaded it but it would just crash. so I tried to re download and I cant install it at all. please fix. note I'm on the original kindel fire.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. I can hardly wait for Mr. Bocelli's concert in December!  I highly recommend this sweet, lovely and very beautiful CD.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|The movie was very entertaining, sometimes funny and great picture quality. Safe to watch for  kids  even slightly younger than the 11 year recommendation by commonsensemedia.org.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love how cute the minions are. the missions are cute and I love how they say pupoy. this is a very cute game GET IT. !
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I have so much fun playing this Game.  I get to see how my friends are doing and what their scores are.  I have not had any problems with It.  Its one of my favorite games.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I am enjoying both CDs of the Piano Guys.  Fun to listen to; creative interpretations; immensely fresh.  I highly recommend either or both CDs to anyone who enjoys cello and piano.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Of all the Nalini Singh's Psy series this book is one of my favourites. Had to read it twice to take it all in, the second read was straight after the other. I could even read it again now.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|Started out fun but soon asks you for $s to continue, puzzles designed to force purchases, can only get more lives with purchase after the 5 you get for linking game to Facebook. Fun but you'll need an extra job to support it.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love this game it is so fun I am addicted to it I can play it all day if I had to
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|He loved it! it's great to have a free download too. I'm not into this kind of music, however, it makes him happy so thanks.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I preordered this book months and months ago. I could hardly wait to read it when it was finally released. All throughout the book I kept thinking WHY IS SHE STARTING THESE NEW STORY LINES? THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME! I was so mad when I got to the end and realized it wasn't the end!!!! Trilogy should mean TRILOGY! Wrap it up already! And the story wasn't even that well written. Not sure if I will read the next installment.
B00000255X|5.0|Bob Dylan has had many knockers over the years. People have become dizzy jumping on and off his bandwagon. There has been plenty who have knocked his voice and style and just as many who have seen him as the messiah. People love some of his songs and loath others. But surely most will agree that Bob Dylan has been the best song writer/storyteller that we have ever seen. Desire is the album that demands to be listened to. He attracted great interest with his wonderfully accessible Blood on the Tracks and then knocked us out with the vast array of songs on Desire. Hurricane was the star attraction but Joey, the other criminal song was even better. Sarah was Dylan at his heartfelt, pleading best. Isis and Mozambique are fresh and engaging and Bob somehow takes you into his own private world. The violin playing is an absolute bonus and if you had doubts about Bob's voice, listen to his phrasing and timing and outpouring of emotion throughout this album. Bob is unique and and engaging, don't listen to Desire once, listen over and over and it will capture your soul.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This has to be the best TV show on television at the moment. Its smart, witty, and sexy. They managed to turn an otherwise very boring subject (the law) into a heart wrenching thriller. I am genuinely surprised by how they manage to create more and more suspense for the following episode. I've gotten my entire family hooked. I'm proud to call myself a Suitor! Well done Aaron Korsh and the entire cast!
B004KPX4W2|3.0|Couldn't find any way to re-download or get help without calling, so flushed the $2.99 and went on with our evening
B0082JYAZ2|5.0|Regina does it again! Fun and upbeat songs with interesting lyrics that I like to listen to again and again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a blast. Way more fun and amusing than Temple Run and Subway Suffers. I can't get enough of how cute the minions are and the game runs smooth.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Amazing story !! Very captivating and intriguing. I just can't wait for the next book to come out. ! The love story between the two is fascinating
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Still in love with Anastasia & Christian! Provocative, Sensual & deeply erotic look into a world of sexual exploration! Leaves every girl longing & dreaming of finding her own Fifty Shades.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was a little leery at 1st, but was quickly hooked. Likeable characters and interesting plot lines. I can't wait to see what else happens.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this was the first erotic book that i have ever read and i thoroughly love it. many people said it was like porn, but when i watch porn i walk away feeling let down and angry. this story has a great love plot and great erotic scenes. i actually fantasized about what it would really be like to do some of the things in this book.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|it was really inspirational...women of all ages should be cheering loud and proud.  Since I live in pacific northwest it was a great visual to go by as she trekked away.
B009410J9I|4.0|Watching this showed where the Stray Cats came from. Really interesting to watch this older show. Great performance and must have for fans.
0920668372|5.0|For our new babies in the family. THIS BOOKS WILL BE A KEEPSAKE. THE MOMMIES LOVED THIS BOOK WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE.
B0095GSKDE|5.0|I got everything I was promised in the description and the book was well taken care of, practically brand new.
1455518999|3.0|I believe this was my first Baldacci book which was read a while ago, and never reviewed apparently.  I did like the Puller character, but was not that interested in the story itself.  Just did not have other characters I cared much about or the story itself.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entwined with You was great! I loved the book (all three books,  actually of the  Crossfire Trilogy). I thought Christian Grey was the man.....from Fifty Shades, well he still is, but I think I love Gideon Cross just a little bit more. I'm a little sorry the way the book ended because there's still things left kind of unfinished....so I hope there story will continue.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I played this game nearly the entire weekend.  Not only does this game take from real-life development decisions and scenarios, it does it in a believable way where you are nicely tricked into believing this 8-bit looking universe is really your start up company.  One is swept away by the near infinite choices one can take during the development cycle and with the financial outcomes of the game.<br /><br />It does start to get old after a while when new console/gaming platform licenses cost more than $20k, but it still remains good casual fun.  Can you get your start up to be a 1 Billion dollar company?
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|This is a great action movie.  It just didn't hit as high as US Marshalls, Star Wars, Ocean's Eleven, Harry Potter--those are my 5's.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a really fun game. It is as close to the original as  you can get. A great app.
B001PS7NL0|5.0|these series of books have always been easy to use and understand. Excellent. I reference these books often and find them always helpful.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|Quite boring for an action flick.  Just was not interested after twenty minutes or so.  Had potential but did not deliver.  The scenes where they were trying to defend the gate to the castle just would not end...
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I loved this book more than I have loved a book in a long time.  The characters and the story are so engaging.  And the story is strong all the way through.  I would highly recommend this one.
B0064MGU98|5.0|If you like dramas this could be for you.  The charature development is good and you can watch as the larger picture is being built.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I am one of those people who think all portable games for phones and tablets are not too hard and most games are like angry birds and just time wasting while your in line waiting at the DMV, but, this games is very well done. It's challenging and I spent hours playing. This game is addicting and fun. I would buy this again given the chance. I was impressed with the depth and how intelligent the AI in this game is. Since you don't directly control your infection it can take a little to get going but the mutations are great and they give the added depth that make game a good strategy game. Buy the end of your first game you'll want to kill all humans and unlock different types of infections and DNA.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I am a huge Marvel fan, so this was definitely fun for me.<br /><br />I would probably watch it again, just to see what Hulk does to Loki...
B001EBWINQ|5.0|have seen this a zillion times and I still cry<br /><br />when she says  , you have to think for both of us...i cant leave you again..paraphrase.<br /><br />patti
1400079276|5.0|couldn't put the book down.....until finished...<br />reading now the 4th this summer.<br />keeps you thinking....life issues are presented in a way that can turn your insights 360 degrees...incredible...
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|It was OK, interesting idea for a story but it wasn't executed well. There was a lot of &#34; Hey, remember this?&#34; obscure references to pop culture that tried to carry the entire story.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|Great music, great album, all of the songs are great, go together and easy to listen to, especially at work
0802473156|4.0|Guide to how different people show and appreciate love. I know how I receive love and how my wife likes to receive love. It's helped our marriage.
0307389839|5.0|My friend turned me on to this writer....Love his style....this was some insight on him personally. Gave me some tips to assist in my own life in regards to goals and the mind
0425263924|5.0|I can't put these books down!  Looking forward to the next!  Fast read and story flows well.  I just hope the next release doesn't take a year!
B0095VPBFY|5.0|Works perfect in my HDMI build. I can play 1080P Videos just fine with it. No complaints runs nice and cool.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The weather channel app was my favorite for getting what I needed. Now they updated it and for me, it is not user friendly. Very difficult to maneuver. Used to find what I needed with just a touch, now I have to look everywhere and can't find what I want. Loved the previous app,  Hate this one!
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot. There was good acting in it and many facts about operas and the singers.
1451696191|5.0|There are life issues that can be difficult to discuss. Sexuality, depression, abuse, and relationship problems are just a few of the \\"touchy\\" subjects that are taken head-on in the novel \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" by author Stephen Chbosky. We follow the main character, Charlie, as his glum high school life takes a turn for the better as he becomes friends with the beautiful Sam and her eccentric brother Patrick. The story is portrayed \\"after-the-fact\\" written out through the typewriter of the main character. Charlie, Sam, and Patrick take on a series of adventures as they try to escape the woes of life through good music and fun parties. As Sam and Patrick learn more of Charlie, they realize his \\"wallflower\\" nature is deeper than the typical shy freshman. Charlie's hidden past slowly starts to take over his happiness and he must rely on his newfound friends to conquer the fears that tempt to destroy his happiness.<br /><br />If you are looking for a GREAT read, this is your book. \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" has an ability to draw the reader into the exciting adventures of its characters. Although fictional, the relationships between Sam, Charlie, and Patrick are the friendships that many of us dream of. As they break free from the oppression of society and personal anxieties, you may catch a glimpse into the opportunities that wait outside of our fears and doubts.
B009EJSUBY|5.0|Hurricane Sandy destroyed about 150 LP's of mine that were 50 years old and in perfect condition. Among them were many of Cliburn.  I could not pass on this amazing all-inclusive set.  I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Cliburn once and will never forget the conversation.  The &#34;miniature&#34; album covers were a plus!
B003BWERF8|4.0|Does what it promises. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much as far as range of volume (In a convertible is just isn't powerful enough). Kills the iPod battery at about the same rate that the headphones' battery dies, a couple of hours. I'd buy it again, but I'll keep looking for something else.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie,  and Jeremy Renner was the perfect Hansel. The dark settings and action helped make this movie seem realistic,  and Famke Janssen was great as the witch. I've watched it several times.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I have been reading Kathy Reichs books for a number of years and love them.  She is a much better writer and story=teller than Patricia Cornwall.  Reichs books don't have that &#34;mad at the world,&#34; &#34;chip on the shoulder&#34; feel of Cornwall's books.  And all the great forensic information is there.  Read them all.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I didn't download this app my uncle did but I haven't really use it so I probably check it out
B00B22MJSG|5.0|My son and I saw a concert of theirs on TV probably broadcast from Canada (since we were near the border) and he became very interested in the music I know from my teens! He wanted the really old stuff, and we found a happy compromise in this album!
1781162646|2.0|I was really excited to get this book but was ultimately disappointed with it. The story had an interesting premise but for a book that's supposed to be a mix of crime, mystery, and coming-of-age, it really leaned only on the latter with a sprinkling of mystery and a bit of an action-packed ending. Definitely don't go into it expecting a page-turner. For Stephen King, I expected more, especially because the writing in 11/22/63 was just at a whole other level. I liked the murder mystery that was woven into Joyland, but it only takes up a small part of the book with the rest about a college-aged boy spending a summer in a beach town. At times, the dialogue felt flat and the suspense was non-existent. The level of intrigue just wasn't up to par for me and I kept waiting for things to pick up. By the time they did, the book was nearly over.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I actually wish the 2-star rating which I gave this book didn't translate to &#34;I don't like it&#34; because actually I did, and the word &#34;fair&#34; would be a more accurate rating. It has it's high points, but sometimes gets bogged down in what all Stephen King fans know to be his tendency of late to arbitrarily thrust  corny caricatures, instead of believable characters, into his story lines and to fill pages with what could ostensibly be said to be little more than the author's stream of thought.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|if you're looking for a no-brain stress reliever of a game, and you love the buggies and the beach, then this game is for you!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This is a good app. It takes a while to catch on. I enjoy it. It's not what I was expecting,but it turns out it is fun. You have too really like these types of games.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Very funny, had a really good time watching this movie. I hope the second follow up is just as good.
B000I8ERVC|5.0|I had this movie on dvd, but I wanted to keep the stream version so I can watch it wherever I go! Cheap!
B007MDB71O|4.0|My family and I decided to watch this at home on a whim.  I hadn't heard much about it other than previews awhile back - which frankly didn't impress me.  However, we were all delighted!  What a fun movie!  We liked it so much we're going to start reading the original series together as a family!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is nice to fall asleep to. The white nose ambience for sleep, meditation & yoga, I am happy with.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Enjoyed the mix of characters and the interesting adventures.  A totally different look at what future space colonies and starships might look like.  The human drives, flaws and desires are much more realistic than Star Trek, although I always enjoyed it also.  It was interesting to see &#34;Lady Heather&#34; from CSI, playing a similar role on one of the episodes.  If you enjoy a story of people living on the edge, flouting authority, indulging in petty crimes, but working with each other honorably you'll enjoy this show.  It's a shame it was cancelled and there is only one season.
B00957T6X6|5.0|If you love the HBO series, you have to read the books. You are missing a lot if you just watch it on tv. Easy to read, navigate, and great price for all of the books!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|While I still liked reading this book, it was not as good as the first two.  I didn't feel like the story progressed very much for the amount of reading I did and it had far more gratuitous sex than the other two books.  Overall, I was disappointed.  I have reread the other two books several times and have not felt compelled to do so with this book.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I don't know about this product. I keep trying to find an app. That will play flash videos and it's not working out for me.  I know kindle and Adobe do not have supporting files. But I have a lot of videos I can't watch. Especially on Facebook. It may not even be this app that has the issue. I don't know. So I really didn't want to give a bad review.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|This is a very funny movie. I love Barbara in this comedy. Very glad to see her back in action.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A very good story.  It keeps you on edge the entire way through.  I was sad it came to the end.
B0051T46XM|5.0|A story about some college students filming the duties of a hunter working for the Troll Security Service in Norway.
B00795P4EG|4.0|This app is ok. It works well. No trouble with any part of the download. I was just looking for more out of it. It needs more options. It's easy to navigate. I think they need to give it more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Simple straight forward game.  Good mindless time waster. The good thing is that you can get in and out of it quickly of you get a text or email and then go right back to it.
B00AATFJK2|5.0|I have recieved early. This was my birthday gift to myself. I always wanted to buy Blue Ray old films. This is one of my favorite of Yul Brynner.
0385349947|5.0|I'm not a senior at a big company; I'm an independent artist type. And I wept to this book for all the ways it validated and shamed me. POWERFUL. All leaders and supporters of leaders can benefit.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|This is a fun read. Lots of interesting threads to weave together. And it's easy to get thru because he doesn't waste a lot of time telling you every detail of every building or blade of grass, but gives just enough description so you know what's going on and can fill in the rest yourself.<br />The only reason I give this 4 out of 5 is that there are so many story lines that it can get confusing. Also, I feel like this kind of story could really use a map at the front of the book.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Have not been able to test how long the battery actually lasts.  I use this headphone amp plugged into my Brookstone small sized projector so that I can boost a signal going into a headphone splitter.  It is always charging through the projectors usb port.  It really adds volume and impact to the audio.  I did use this on my computer as well as MP3 player and it made a huge difference in dynamics and making the music more impactful...even at lower volumes.  I can recommend this product if you need to add some volume to your music devices output.
B006JRY2QG|4.0|SOA is a solid show. Good storyline, good characters and good action. Probably not on the same level as Sopranos or Boardwalk Empire, but for a standard cable TV show it is very good.
B007EC27QM|5.0|pay the $1 for no ads. The ads on free aren't terribly annoying, but I'd like the screen space for the app alone.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Don't waste your money even renting this movie. Bad from the start and just got worse thereafter.  Dumb and Boring!!!!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I loved this book.  Found C.S. frustrating at times, but loved reading about her journey. I would recommend to friends.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift and he loved it.  Great price as well.  Songs by Sammy Hagar and crew are very good as well. Recommend for any Sammy Hagar fans........
B005K17RU0|1.0|The new update killed a good app.  Too much paging to get around is needed now.  Go back to what worked.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Jeffrey Archer remains one of my favorite authors. His sagas that cover decades and generations are beautifully written and are unparalleled when it comes to character development. The first two books in The Clifton Chronicles were page turners. I loved some of the characters and despised others. I could not wait for the third to be published to see where Lord Archer would go with the storyline. While I enjoyed The Best Kept Secret, I was somewhat disappointed in the conclusion. Does this book call for still another sequel? If so, I hope our next look at the Clifton or Barrington families avoids  mystery side plots too contrived to fit this genre of writing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Much better than I could have imagined, much more of a love story than led to believe  I love these stories
B0060MYM3S|4.0|If it is like the series it will be wonderful.  Glad to get it, have not watched it as yet.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|i like this game it is fun and colorful some challenges . i would  recommend this if you like to relax and have some fun...
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This movie took us by surprise.  We could not remember this ever being at the theatre. It would have been amazing on the big screen.  The story of the six magic beans is promulgated by monks.  Jack's uncle (his parents died) asks him to trade the horse for supplies.  While the King's right hand man is plotting against him, good looking Jack unkowingly rescues the princess and makes an impression.  While ruinning from a bad guy in the palace courtyard, a monk begs Jack to trade his horse for the magic beans.  they make the trade and once a bean hits water...Kablooey! No bad language, no sex, no nudity, no compromising situations. Many life lessons you talk about with your kids afterwards - doing what you're asked to do, bonds of friendship, bravery, and love.  The liberties that the writers took with this story are excellent and the movie is left wide open for a sequel. Must see!
B002KGEORM|5.0|it is a great show i love it action violence sex all the good stuff like a jsmes bond movie
B000YDE46Y|4.0|2nd pair of this style I've owned. They're good shoes, comfortable and easy to wear. They look great. The leather softens after a few wears and feels really good. Get a lot of compliments on these. They do tend to run a 1/2 to full size large though.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and would recommend it to everyone who hasnt already watched it.  Keeps you coming back time after time.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|Highly entertaining and informative.  Lessons on friendship, poverty, determination and redemption. No sex, light-hearted kissing booth scene, no bad language, no nudity. Definately for the entire family age 8 - 88!
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|Too much religious reference turned me off, it was a good starting point to think differently and re evaluate the relationship but like I mentioned, too much emphasis on religion.
1423140605|5.0|I have read all the Percy Jackson books many times.  I love them. But The Mark of Athena is my all time favorite of Riordan. I think he improved as an author with each book.  When i first picked up The Lost Hero, i thought it was going to be another crappy run-off series  and that in the ed i would be disappointed. I was wrong. I like this series much better. The characters have grown and are now closer to my age.  I understand them much better now. Now, this book is my favorite.  After waiting for the two camps to unite, I was estactic with the reunion. It, like the rest of the book, was funny and entertaining, Riorden created a great boo with humor, drama, and loads of action packed inside. the points of view made it an easier book to read and easier to understand the characters. I loved Percy and Annabeth, and I liked those POV the best.  Overall a must-read!
B005LAIH2M|4.0|Anticipated an awful movie, came away pleased it wasn't an entire waste of money.  Worth renting just to see how many times the F word was used.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|The queen mother insists that her daughter act ladylike.  While the daughter only wants to shoot arrows ( which she is good at) mom and dad are planning a big party where potential suitors wil try to impress the daughter for her hand in marriage.  Daughter is disgusted.  She runs away into the forest where she happens upon a witch and asks her to change her mother. The mother is changed and then begins a different relationship between mother and daughter.  Even though the mother cannot speak until she is \\" changed back\\", she learns much about her daughter and ultimately respects her daughter's wishes. Every character has a unique Scottish accent and the men are huge and the ladies small.  There is no nudity, sex or bad language. Good versus evil theme. All in all good movie.
B009YBU8CQ|4.0|Purple Hibiscus is a worthwhile read.<br /><br /> Although, the plot structure and narrative do not bring forth any new ideas or scenarios, and are at times predictable...there is a lyricism and poetic images in the writing that I find stunning.<br /><br />Stories set out with the intent to disparage past and current systems, often (in my mind) serve a self fulfilling prophecy...meaning the plot unravels as it HAS to unaravel, in order to prove its moral point. It leaves the reader with a sense of disbelief, and no real connection for or towards the characters. Perhaps Papa Nukwukwu seemed the only tangible device of the story, and that is because his presence, his actions, his life reflects that of most elderly people around the world. However, with the case of Papa Eugene, Aunty Ifeoma and her children, and mostly Fada Amaka...their characters and actions seem forced and exaggerated.<br /><br />There is no doubt that colonialism, religion and assimilation have played a major hand in re creating countries where conflicts of culture, interests and beliefs set the stage. However, this book presents its case and closes the door on a discussion of solutions before it ends. It reads as a made up world, far away, that solves its problems for the reader...leaving us to put down Purple Hibiscus and start on another book without much secondary thought to the plight of Nigeria or its people.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I liked this movie when it was first released and watched it again last night.  I think it does a great job of capturing an era which was much more innocent.  I love the music, the fashions, the references to early '70s pop culture and the kinds of adventures that young girls would share in those days.  It is a sweet, nostalgic \\"feel-good\\" movie.
B001V7UXG2|1.0|I watched Jeeves and Wooster many years ago and really enjoyed it.  It says on the Amazon site that it has subtitle but it does not.  This makes it really difficult for one who has become hard of hearing.  Not of any value to me.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This movie is hilarious...it's one of my mine and my husband's favorites.  Can't help but laugh throughout the whole thing.  Great movie!
147674355X|4.0|See my review of the heartbreaking but beautiful new adult novel \\"Hopeless\\" by Collen Hoover at: [...]<br /><br />4 stars; not for the faint of heart, but well worth the read.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|I guess I'm getting older.  This stuff just doesn't interest me anymore I guess - I feel asleep on the couch, woke up once to turn it off.  Good thing is no bad dreams - but I had a nice nap.  Maybe I should have just taken a nap in the first place and skipped this bad movie...probably.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is a good and fun time killler. when I am bored with all of my other kindle fire games I always gotta play this
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A real work of art with beautiful descriptions, romance and delight.  I would recommend definitely.  I enjoyed from start to finish.
B00BPWDMP2|3.0|In my opinion, there are only 2 really good songs on this album, #4 & #5.  My son, age 4, only likes #4 and then asks for other music
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I use this app to setup my range extender. It is very useful because you can move your range extender and walk around the house to see how far the range has extended! Very useful indeed! Recommended!
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|One of the best movies done this year.  If you like Fantasy, and Oz books like I do, you'll enjoy this movie.  It tells how the Wicked Witch of the West got green.  It explains about the sisters, wicked Witch of the east, and West.  And finally it tells you how the Wizard got there in the first place.  Wonderful Movie, worth watching more than once.

B00AZL3PBK|1.0|At first this game was fun but then it wouldn't work. Like when I started a knew level then I just die each time it started.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Netflix does not have season 3! I never thought I would like this show, but after episode 1 of season 1, I just couldn't stop watching! kinda sad there isn't a season 4 yet.
B004INHTK4|3.0|Every Mother should accept each child has different characters, with different ideas and feeling. I felt this mother had an unreal feeling of possession for her children.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Fun to play. Can level up fairly quickly. Cool game!  Interesting to see how the dragons evolve and interact within the game!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|The game loaded...but had no instructions....just a picture of a room...I ouched the screen etc...found nothing...just blank boxes on the right
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|It was very brave of Cheryl Strayed to share this life altering experience with us.  I thought it was raw, honest and beautifully written.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|there was too much lag maybe its because I have too much storage space that it caused it to lag I rate this 2 stars
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I mean you get to take care of horses you get to train them and race them.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game to waste time with doesnt require a whole lot of thought but is engaging, a little one note but to be expected for a free app. Fun at the right price, a little clunky a points.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Cute and funny zombie movie. For those who aren't zombie fans, give this one a shot. It is a cute zombie romance!
B005544TRQ|5.0|It is a great lawyer show. Like all lawyerly shows, the legal bases is not always accurate. However, this show is very entertaining with a great story line. Unlike many shows, the pilot gets you hooked from the beginning.
B0014DW3OS|5.0|Training is a film that displays Denzel's gift of acting and is very engaging to watch throughout the entire time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A captivating game indeed. I will admit getting stuck on the number pyramid and utubing some help. .Waiting for more levels....
B006RXPUR2|5.0|I'd heard the movie was amazing back when it was in the theater, but never got around to seeing it. SO glad I downloaded via Amazon, and wish I'd done so earlier. Really atmospheric and authentic (accents, expressions, neighborhoods) to Boston, and the issues presented by the story gave me a lot to think about-- I like things to be black and white, right or wrong, but there's a whole lot of gray. Not always easy to watch, but well worth doing so!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Great mic it cappsures my voice and nothing else so great just an awesome mic for that money of only $25
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Awesome story line - I was so deep into this story - Eva and Gideon are still  with me.  I'm holding my breath till I know what happens next
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This charger is great.  I can charge my wife's Iphone and mine at the same time or another device.  It's small, a big plus.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such a great show.  I can't wait for season 4.  I wish I had started watching it earlier, but getting it free with my prime membership was great as I watched all three seasons in one week!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book kept my interest from beginning to end. Now... where's the next book in the series? I'm buying it right now!! :)
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|The Movie Oz the Great and powerful in theatres was extraordinary in 3D the Blu-ray version was also good but the Kindle Fire HD was fabulous as it was so vibrant the colors were so good they seem like you would get your hands dirty from touching the screen and the sound was great and powerful.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I like movies that have magical/fantasy themes.  The way the movie ended, I hope there is a possiblity of a sequel.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book depicts a strange, new World of the future where government controls everything.  It is not a happy story to read, but one that is thought provoking.  Although the book was written for late teenagers, it is just as good for adults.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I wish there were more episodes per season! The characters are real and deliver heartfelt performances.  I could watch this every day.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|was looking for a piano app for kindle this one works pretty good.I also liked the price of free.<br />it does have play along tunes or other tunes you could add to it.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I grew up liking animation/cartoons with magical/fantasy themes even into adulthood.  I can now entertain younger relatives that come to visit.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is a good one to check in on throughout the day and allows you to create an interesting place to build a fairly cute space for some pretty neat looking dragons.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Very easy to read, i enjoyed the story and cant wait for the movie. The ending however was a little blunt, maybe i wanted more
B008602KQI|2.0|...are what I enter any book-turned-movie with. Most often, this is a helpful strategy, though sometimes it's wholly unnecessary (e.g. Lord of The Rings)<br /><br />I should note, as well, that in this case, the plot lines and relationships in both were rather juvenile. But this was a teen fantasy fiction, so I cannot criticize on this point. I think the problem I had was that this movie missed many of the elements that helped even an adult reader suspend belief regarding the rather preposterous premise of an annual pubescent death-match. Katniss's character development was relegated to a brief saunter in the woods and a couple of grainy flashbacks. The backstory of this dystopia were summarized with a few lines of text in the beginning of the film with some follow-up via the game commentators.<br /><br />The books, I felt, were very violent and graphic. The themes were very disturbing, as well; but the overall experience was page-turning. This film relied almost entirely on the suspense of the game, itself. Instead of enjoying the role of omniscient viewer of their world, I was limited to feeling like a common spectator of the Hunger Games.
B007MDB71O|5.0|ORIGINALLY POSTED ON MY WEBSITE [...] (WIth a few updates for Amazon!)<br /><br />I have never read the books upon which John Carter was based.  I was aware of them and the legacy that these stories have and their importance so I, much like many others, came into this movie as an outsider and a movie fan.  Needless to say I was quite taken by it.  As a result, I kept thinking back to it, and as an outsider who had but the most basic of understanding about the story I found myself genuinely enjoying it and just how much fun I had seeing John Carter.  I still keep thinking back to how incredibly well done it was.  Not only that, but once again, how much fun the movie was to watch.  So here (with mild spoilers) are the reasons why you should, no, NEED to see John Carter...<br /><br />1. Lynn Collins as Deja Thoris: Lynn Collins steals every scene that she is in and not only because of her stunning looks.  Her performance as the princess of Helium is excellent and she is deftly able to handle the heavy swordplay sequences.  She stands out as a strong female character and a well written heroine and much less the damsel in distress.  And it certainly helps that she is VERY easy on the eyes.<br /><br />2. The look of the movie is incredible.  There are flying vehicles unlike any that I have ever seen before in a movie.  There are creatures so bizarre they defy description.  You see every penny of that $250M budget that everyone seems to concerned about up on that screen.<br /><br />3. WOOLA.  The Martian dog or \\"calot\\" as he is known in the books is awesome!  When Lynn Collins is not stealing every scene, then Woola is!  Woola runs fast, adds some wonderful comic relief and is part of some of my favorite moments in the movie.  When John Carter is told that he does not have \\"a dog in this fight,\\" my only thought was YES he DOES!  His name is Woola and he is one hell of a dog!  I think that everyone in our little group loved that dog.  Proof that dogs from any planet are awesome.<br /><br />4. Taylor Kitsch as John Carter is excellent.  He is an excellent leading man.  He was the one saving grace of X-Men Origins: Wolverine and he has only gotten better since that movie came out.  (Oddly enough, Lynn Collins was also in that movie where she played Silver Fox.)  His performance as John Carter is wonderful and he is more than able to carry this movie from beginning to end.<br /><br />5. Tars Tarkas.  Willem Dafoe as the leader of the Tharks is wonderful both in performance and character. I simply love his character and the humor he brings to the proceedings.  One of my favorites in the movie.<br /><br />6. The action is incredible.  There is a scene where John Carter takes on an entire army solely with the help of Woola.  Swordplay is one of those things that I love watching in a movie and this one does not disappoint.  There are some shots in the action sequences that look like they come out of a Frank Frazetta painting.  This is a very well shot movie without a doubt.<br /><br />7. Legacy. This movie is based on a story that was written 100 years ago.  This movie was the inspiration for projects and characters like Star Wars, Superman, Flash Gordon, and the list goes on.  Sure it feels familiar.  That is because this story has been culled from, strip mined, borrowed from and blatantly stolen from.  This is the story where it all began.  If nothing else for its cultural and historical significance this deserves to be seen.  This movie pays respect to a story by being true to its source material.  Unlike another movie that is out there that destroys the main idea of the story and replaces it with a kid who wants to score with a girl.  I am looking right at you, LORAX!<br /><br />8. It is never a stupid movie. Nothing stupid happens.  Nothing where the audience can say that a story idea or a character looked stupid.  No one makes any stupid decisions and the movie never condescends to its viewers.  This is a highly intelligent yet entertaining movie.<br /><br />9. The effects work is excellent.  But then it was done by the masters at Pixar who started as a branch of Industrial Light and Magic.  You no doubt have seen their work in the animated movies although they are far from the kiddie cartoon studio that they can be dismissed as.  Their early effects can best be referenced in a movie that got them noticed.  That movie was Young Sherlock Holmes and the effects work is a testament to the quality that was made standard by Pixar.<br /><br />10. Andrew Stanton is the director.  He is no slouch when it comes to making good movies.  He has made two of the highest grossing movies for Pixar with Finding Nemo and Wall-E.  Both of those movies are great.  This is his first live action movie and he handles it extremely well. He has a good cinematic eye for live action and the movie is never ever boring.  I firmly disagree with anyone who says the pacing is off because I was never once bored at all...<br /><br />Bottom line is, go see John Carter.  There are two sequels planned and if positive word of mouth is what will help this movie, then I will shout it to the heavens because this was a damn fine movie.
B000IXUOP0|5.0|NCIS was at it's best from season 3 to season 6. This is no exception: the perfect combination of humor and suspense while carefully enriching each character background with every episode.<br /><br />Save yourself some money and buy the entire Season 4 all at once.
B00000IMTH|5.0|this is fantastic cd Ronnie James is 1000% perfect He always did his best, in what ever he did.This cd mark the end of his with Rainbow. Rainbow Eyes stands out here.Kind of a good bye to rainbow and rainbow fans.Little did we know He wasn't done not even close!
B007MDB71O|5.0|The only movie who has given me the same epic feeling i got from all the star-wars movies... Original and pure class. All the elements i wish for in a sci-fi adventure like this!<br />I cant stand the thought of Disney not making a sequel.<br />My highest number on my cinema wish-list by far!
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Lots of action but short on plot and character development. It was a little too busy. The individual films work better.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the gAme can't seem to stop playing......really didn't want to stop playing but it made to do this stupid review.....Awesome gAme love love love it
B006AN78XS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Watched it with my in laws and they all liked it too. Recommended for sure.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This has the worst & most abrupt ending I've ever seen. I felt like I'd wasted my money and time after waiting patiently for this.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Product was exactly as advertisied, communication, and delivery were better than expected. I would highly recommend buying this and all other seasons.
B001V7UXG2|3.0|Wooster is a dweeb, Jeeves exudes &#34;cool&#34;.  If several episodes watched at one sitting, it gets a bit silly. Is just ok.
B008Y74B10|5.0|Politicians will say its all Hollywood, but they still won't answer any questions as to how DC and the Banks managed to let $Trillions$ disappear.  According to DC, we got Made off, it was all his fault.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Very pleased with this purchase. I have only watched the first season so far, but the package arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Thank you!
B004IV32HU|4.0|If you are a Johnny Depp fan, this is a good one to see how far his range goes yet again.  Martin L.  is genius in this.  All the actors did a fine job with a weird script and little set design.  Sad story made amusing.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book held my interest from start to finish.  I can't imagine ever going through what Jaycee did and learn to survive it.  She showed such courage and intelligence to get through her ordeal.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|If you liked the movie you will love the book. The book has more depth and more character development than the movie.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|Love the graphics and the different scenarios.  This game is a ton of fun to play and before you know it, hours have slipped by.
B0027VTMAE|4.0|Which one would you choose.  Johnny Depp puts on another great performance in this dramatic thriller about a book specialist in the area of ancient and rare literature.  He tries to authenticate different versions of a book, rumored to be co-written by the Lucifer himself.  What ensues is chaos involving an eccentric philanthropist, business man, a cult and super-natural protector.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. The  corporate manipulations to try and guide an outcome, against a rebel who doesn't care about rules makes the movie fun to watch. The plot twists and the &#34;gotchas&#34; are amazing.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I give this book five stars, because, wow, who couldn't???? That was one crazy book, but in a good way. I mean, I loved it but the whole time travel thing was confusing. I just...  I mean... it just didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. I just can't get it completely. I doubt I ever will, but in all that time, I can reread a great book.
B007Y36K46|5.0|I never had any intention of watching this film, but my dad asked me to watch it with him the other night so I did. I absolutely loved it! I was pleasantly surprised! I liked the whole idea of the movie being told as a story that wasn't actually finished. I thought that was very clever and came together nicely at the end. This movie was a visual treat with excellent special effects, and the action was well-paced and entertaining. I also enjoyed the humorous bits, and the love story was a nice little tie-in. I was worried the love story might get tossed aside, but I'm so glad it didn't. The acting was superb and the story had heart. At no time during this movie did I feel like it was just something churned out to make money at the box office. It really seemed to be a labor of love. I am picky about my sci-fi flicks, and I am so glad I gave this one a chance. I'm ready to watch it again!
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|An underrated Disney film that's fun for most adults.  Lots of puns used through out the movie.  David Spade put on one of his best voice acting performances for this film.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|Didn't think it was as good as the other Transformer movies, but still enjoyed it. It was still a nice action/adventure movie
B009O2XY12|4.0|This game is very riveting.  It keeps your interest.  Be prepared: it takes practice and skill.  Enjoyable regardless of age.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|very good cd.  We love his style and especially &#34;Wagon Wheel&#34;  True Believer and many more are also great.  Thank you
B003YCI1O8|5.0|I mean, really.  Ancient predators that recently became active near a small town with less than 20 residents in a desert valley.  Cut off from any outside assistance, the residents must battle these creatures that burrow through the ground and attack it's prey from underground.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Once again Marvel is telling the stories of people more than the superheroes. Trying to get &#34;look at me, I am great&#34; Tony Stark, &#34;I am a God&#34; Thor, and Bruce Banner who is afraid to &#34;let the Big Guy loose&#34; to work together for the greater good makes an interesting story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun. me and my husband love the.movies and we figured it would entertain my nieces and nephew when we babysit. they love it and so so we. we are still in the middle of the game but so far its awesome so says a five yr old. the only thing we dont get is the combo for the gifts does any one know any thing about it? but this game is loved by alot in this house. makes us laugh everytime.
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|i like to listen to some of bakes music, but not a fan of all of it<br />a lot of his stuff sounds the same with just different words if you know what i mean
1609611543|5.0|Over the 4th of July, I read this book after my Nutritionist suggested I remove wheat and gluten from my diet due to various symptoms I was having. This book was a real eye opener for me. Since reading the first two chapters, I've let go of 5 lbs so far and a few inches, although I haven't measured myself in the past two weeks since starting (pants are looser).<br /><br />I'm fastidious now about reading labels, as even the so called gluten free items I had so eagerly pulled into my shopping cart, indicate on their label that they do indeed contain the various starches: powder, corn or tapioca.<br /><br />Mentally, I'm clearer, and physically, I'm not suffering the bouts of random pain that would strike while or after eating wheat and/or gluten. I went cold turkey, and I'm glad I did! There are lots of delicious, healthy options. It does force one to be a bit more organized and prepared, but the constant desire for finding something to eat has diminished almost to zero. I no longer have cravings 24x7. I feel more in control of my own time without food being the driving force of my activities.<br /><br />As a menopausal woman with Hashimoto's thyroid condition and experiencing constant and rapid weight gain over the past year, this is the answer I've been seeking.<br /><br />I can't thank the author of this book enough for putting this information out there! I'm grateful and hope that you keep up the good work, so others will find the freedom that I'm coming to know again.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I've loved about every Marvel movie in this franchise, but this has to be my hands down favorite. It's the best superhero movie ever in my opinion. The best of all the characters, everyone gets to shine a bit, good plot, great development, and edge of your seat action through it all. Plus the genius of Loki. What's not to love? Highly recommend it for comic book fans, superhero fans, action fans, and anyone who just wants a great movie.
B008YW5RH2|4.0|One of the better free apps out there and probably the best tennis app on the market currently.  Takes some practice,  but is easy enough to learn quickly.  Enjoyable smooth play on the kindle fire.  There are ads that come up after each match, but you can just close the ad and move on to the next match.  Decent range of play for free with several different opponent options including daily matches that always change.  Wish the game play included topspin and slice shot options, but for a free app it is very good as is.  Highly recommend getting this game even if your not a huge tennis fan,  it is well worth it.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada<br /><br />An excellent roller coaster ride. Guns, planes, explosions, boat chases, cool hidden gadgets, secret agents, all of what you'd expect from a Bond film, only set against the background of World War II. The protagonist? Bond's creator, Ian Fleming.<br /><br />Here the author paints an awesome backdrop for Fleming's escapades across Britain, Europe and North Africa during World War II. Get ready for a thrilling read.<br /><br />Pros: Very smooth read. Characterizations were actually great. You could tell most of the characters apart just from their dialogue or demeanor. Great twists and turns, wonderfully plotted, and all the Bond conventions were easily recognizable. Book was tough to put down.<br /><br />Cons: The use of other languages was a little off-putting at some points, where I could either a) almost understand what was being said in French, Spanish, or German (and direct translation just after the dialogue wasn't offered) or b) wonder if the Germans/French/Spanish were actually speaking English.<br /><br />At one point, Fleming says, &#34;I only need a dinner coat&#34; or something similar...which proves to be false. Actually the plan requires a heck of a lot more than that. There are a few other tiny punctuation or spelling errors, but not enough to drop us a star.<br /><br />CAVEAT: If you are a massive World War II buff, I'm not sure if this novel will prove to be historically accurate. Since i'm not, and I'm also not a Bond nut, this didn't bother me in the slightest. I'm also not going to research WWII terminology, contemporary fashion, gun models, tank models, or any of those other details some obsess about. It was a fun read without nitpicking.
B00C061I3K|4.0|Takes music back to it's roots. This is definitely not the &#34;EDM&#34; album the bros were expecting. If you don't like funk/disco don't buy this album.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|This album wasn't as fun for me as their previous releases, however, I still enjoyed it. I am a Vampire Weekend fan for life.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I got this and Walking Disaster and read them simultaneously following each chapter through the eyes of Travis and Abby. I truly enjoyed this, and I believe that anyone would. Its a great story, keeps you interested and addicted. A must read!!!
0062255657|5.0|It did not disappoint! In true Gaiman fashion, there were suspense filled and oh my gosh moments. I became engrossed immediately and was involved with the main character. I highly recommend this book
0945001193|4.0|This book should be required reading for everyone so that the evil of Hitler as presented in this book is never forgotten.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use the bible daily, it is a powerful book which has all the answers to question I have about living this life. Also to help make it better for others,
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Got it for my husband...we love the Stones..great cd's...if you are a stones fan gotta have this set!  Saw the stones live in 1975 at the Akron Rubber Bowl!  Yeah we're old!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What a wonderful game! The puzzles are challenging but not too difficult, provides a good few hours of entertainment. If anything, sometimes the simple hints they give when exploring we're too much for me. Would love to have the option to turn those off for those who want a straight challenge (or just make them more observational not leading, like simply a square hole not a square hole that looks good for ____). My only real problem? It's over! Want more! Please please update and add at least five more rooms!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The plot didn't really grip me until about halfway through. It was a long setup, but worth it. However, the prose is so good that you never get bored. Flynn doesn't an excellent job distinguishing the voices of her two main characters (I dare not call either a protagonist)and giving them both unique writing styles. Right after finishing Gone Girl I ordered Sharp Objects. I'm now a Gillian Flynn fan. And she's cute.
B00AB7IA1S|4.0|I was a little bit worried about this one, admittedly. For one, the 3-star rating made it seem like another one of THOSE apps (that is, until I read the reviews). For another, the images for the game screamed &quot;I have bad permissions and in-app purchasing.&quot; Whether or not that applies to anyone else, I don't know. It's probably just me. And third, when I first downloaded it and opened the application, it gave me an error and told me to re download the application. That wouldn't have been a big deal to me if I hadn't noticed that my wireless was off when it gave me the error, which then made me think that the application required an internet connection to run.<br /><br />However, every single one of those worries are gone as of now. It works great in airplane mode, runs smoothly, no bad permissions, and the 3-star rating is mainly just other people having issues with screen orientation on the Kindle Fire, which I don't have because my screen orientation is locked in place. So, onto the game!<br /><br />My reasons for giving this game a 4/5 rating is this: The game is a lot of fun, very simple concept - get the flying things from one end of the maze of the other using various tools (I've only gotten to the fans so far). It's one of those games that I find fun with or without music, and I also like the fact that you can just skip over the initial storyline scene. Here's my one complaint: the hints system makes the game too easy. Not only do the flag markers all show up at once, but they stay up until you turn it off. This kinda ruins the challenge, although you do still have to figure out the correct orientation for the object you are placing. I think the hints system would be a lot better if the flag markers either showed up one at a time or disappeared after you place one object and forced you to retoggle the hints system on. I have more ideas, but I don't want to take up too much of this review with it.<br /><br />Besides that, I don't have any other complaints. If you're deterred by the game's overall rating, just read the reviews and give this game a try. I think you'd enjoy it, at least for a little while.<br /><br />- Sam
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this series (and of course I am now onto Shift & Dust).<br />I also love that the author gives us the chance to buy them all at once, there's no way one could stop reading this right in the middle.<br />Thanks for keeping good books affordable Hugh!
1781162646|5.0|Joyland was deffinitely a different kind of Stephen King book.  I didn't once worry about reading it alone at night.  In face, there wasn't much that COULDN'T  have happened......if you belileve in the spirit world.
B0060MBJCK|5.0|Very intense read.  I love chuck's prose, very manly, short sentences and plenty of action.  I can't wait to find out if his other novels are as good as fight club.
0345803493|5.0|The series is much more than I expected. It has a wonderful story line. I was expecting more sex scenes which there were plenty but loved the fact that it has such a wonderful story line. Had me crying at different times reading this book.
B006IGZX0C|4.0|It's been a while since I saw it, but it's a truly touching and interesting, well written and well acted piece showing a small piece of history in the south. The acting was superb, Octavia Spencer certainly deserved her Oscar and I was surprised that Emma Stone wasn't nominated.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Used to use this app daily, uninstalled it today after the latest update. It used to be usable when docked, now it is locked in portrait orientation. Videos are unable to be selected. I avoided the update on google for months, seems amazon finally got it, bummer. :(
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was fun game. Challenging and entertaining.  I recommend this to everybody. Clever level design. I wish there was more levels available.
B00CSJYYO4|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's creative, fabulous, magic and I identified me with this book!<br />Also it inspired me to do things and fight for my dreams and never surrender.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|It's a very intricate story showing major dysfunctional family and their issues.<br />Based on the fact that this is a comedy, it's not quite funny, but the story has interesting discussions.<br />I would have enjoyed more if the main character played by Paul Rudd was more likeable, but his choices in life are not that great.<br />The acting is quite good, specially some of the guest actors like: John Lithgow, Albert Brooks and Melissa McCarthy.<br />If you like the Judd Apatow movies you'll like this one, but I like the other ones better.
B002LANLDK|5.0|I enjoyed it from beginning to the end. I've already watched this movie three times. I recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys fast cars.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I loved this book it leaves you hanging at the end so you need to buy the next book.Trust me I will buy the next one. I am a BIG reader and I have a summer reading list do I have many more books to read this summer.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|Amazing acting by Julie Delpy - She singlehandedly carries the entire film- loved how authentic and real the film felt- Great dialogue-great and unexpected ending
B004NFB4EO|5.0|One of her best songs and this single will probably go down in history as the biggest anthem for equality.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|The costumes, colors, special effects, etc are great - it is Disney after all; but the story was not as impressive.  Wish I had not spent the money.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|When I downloaded  this game, I thought you could play with your Amazon friends who had this app. But it requires Facebook. I'm only 11, so I couldn't do the tournament. Very disappointed.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Very good emotional and entertaining movie for anyone who loves dogs and the loyalty they show to their owners and families.
B001HN690O|5.0|This was bought as a gift for my hubby. Very cute movie! Blue Ray with good price. Definitely would recommend.
B0054SMID0|4.0|This is the first time I watch an instant streaming movie with my Prime membership.  Didnt know there were so many movies to watch with my membership.  This movie was a twist after twist movie that kept you wondering what the heck is going on.  Highly recommended if you havent watched it.
B005DD7H50|5.0|It had a lot of twists and turns it also was very suspenseful and the ending had a great twist.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|The history was better than expected!! I hope other bands do the same as there could be a few good stories.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I really like this headset, crisp, clear audio, the microphone automatically mutes when you flip it up. The wireless range on it isn't bad either and the ear cups fit fully over my huge ears :)
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|I really liked this book. The advice was very hands on, totally doable and practical. I have already implemented some of these ideas in my work and every day life and have noticed significant improvements. The language is straightforward and easy to understand. The chapters are the right length and the flow was very smooth.i would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|At first I didn't like the recycled older tv hollywood actors. but then, the plots and story lines seemed to take over. Sometimes the acting was so predictable and also the lines delivery. but, the story lines kept me coming back. I would say that Suits is the high end legal show and Wife is the low brow but with an intelligent plot each episode.
B007JNWQZS|5.0|I love the fact that this combo was available!  It beats having to get them separately and this available for a fraction of the cost!  I love how this got here so quickly and was well packaged for delivery!  I really appreciate it!  Thanks a bunch, Suzette!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Out of the first three books this is the best.  I couldn't put it down. It kept me wanting more. I never knew what to expect next.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Loved it.  I would say that Suits is the high end legal show and Wife is the low brow but with an intelligent plot each episode.
B00CAZOHDO|5.0|This is one of the best albums of the year. A great up beat mix of alt-rock, pop, jazz. Check out the samples, you won't regret it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I normally do not play games on my Kindle or IPad but in this case I have been home schooling a 9 year old.  He knew about this game and I allowed him to play it on my IPad.  I now have a Kindle Fire and put not only Temple Run 1 but Temple Run II.  It's quite a diversion and fun to play.
B00AEFXLBQ|5.0|Love this movie! First saw it as a teenager and have watched it many times since then. Great 60's movie. Love and romance.
0307476073|5.0|I'm wild about Wild. This well-written memoir records Cheryl's journey along the Pacific Crest Trail, and her life, in 1995. Her tales remind me of our own experiences of backpacking portions of the PCT and REI. It was excruciating to read about her pain and ignorance, but she was brutally honest and humble. Congratulations to a wonderful book and successful journey.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|quirky space opera.  The strong female characters provide a welcome change to the gender biased women in most science fiction fare.  The series harkens back to the glory days of Science Fiction.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Wonderful movie! Although it was geared for children, I wanted to see it before I saw it with my grandchildren. Loved it!!
B004ADF7RO|5.0|One of the best family-type movies ever, if your'e looking for boys-will-be-boys, friendship, adventure, coming-of-age, suspense, comedy--Goonies has it all. The characters and dialog are real-- kids don't always take turns when they talk (and groups of boys don't always use language that their parents would approve of)! Some &#34;mild&#34; cuss words, some &#34;mildy&#34; scary parts for the younger or more sensitive viewers. Our family loves it. &#34;GOONIES NEVER SAY DIE!&#34;  :)
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Good characters and interesting plot. I think this show is well done. There is not a lot fantasy like in Game of Thrones but it has a similar feel to it.
0743298039|5.0|This Novel if the only one written by Diane Setterfield. Originally a professor of French Literature at various Universities she grew tired of faculty politics and quit to write. Oh my did she. I discovered this novel by chance and read it in 3 days. Hurry and read it, coming out on BBC2 in the fall. There are more skeletons in the closets in this book and the end is like fireworks in the sky. My must read of Mysteries!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Suspensive and romance wrapped up in one amazing book and series. Bring on the next. Gotta see what the Templeton's are up to.
B009ICQ6KO|1.0|first listen, cd skipped<br />I know it was new but I felt it was used or abused.<br />Won't order cd's again.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|From the first coy look of Drocas Lane and her &#34;one weakness&#34; to the fear of Laura being sent away from Lark Rise to the &#34;Big City&#34; of Candleford. You fall in love with every character and cannot wait for each and every episode.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is a great movie and certainly the very best adaptation so far of a classical book. An amazing adventure and a story that one hundred years ago continues to inspire many modern science fiction movies. A must see for the whole family.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a great family movie,<br />the dog is precious and so wholesome<br />for all family members one and all.
B00CMYRVAO|4.0|i've always  said that  Joe is One of the most underrated R&B artists ever. vocally he is always on point and always has a good song or two. however the only knock is one of those songs that will take him back down to his hey day past of a classic song. he has  strong arrangements and grooves.  this album has some moments. the last album of his i dug was his \\"Signature\\" album.  he still has the  goods musically its just missing that knockout  track. however its  a pretty good set.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is the real deal! Not some lame Stallone adaptation. Dredd is one of the best comic book adaptation ever. I am so looking forward to the team getting together again and making the next episode!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Fantastic movie, love it! Good price, good quality! worth watching. Many unforgettable quotes. Wish I have a tiger to keep me company! :)
B005HEPIDS|4.0|I always enjoy Star Trek and Voyager was one of my favorites.  Anyone who likes Star Trek or sci fi would enjoy this series.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|it is frustrating. when you go to come the hair you have to come one stand at a time it takes forever and you have to pay for allot get yoca toca instead and you don't have to pay for any thing
B001ANYDAO|1.0|Text to voice is a big feature of Kindle but now books are blocking it.  This is one of those books.
B00026WU7I|5.0|With songwriting at its conventional best, it doesn't get any better than \\"Blood On The Tracks\\". Here, Dylan pours his heart & soul into every track - ten of the finest tracks ever put on disc! Mr. Dylan outdoes himself on the whimsical \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\" & does an intellectual double-take on \\"Idiot Wind\\". Yes, all of the songs are about relationships concerning love. \\"Simple Twist Of Fate\\" is about a love gone wrong, & \\"You're A Big Girl Now\\" is about loving & learning & moving forward after a breakup or divorce. \\"Meet Me In The Morning\\" is a catchy tune about a secret rendezvous. \\"Buckets of Rain\\" is about the sadness of dealing with a broken heart & \\"If You See Her, Say Hello\\" deals with loneliness & longing after a split. What makes \\"Blood On The Tracks\\" a masterpiece, is that it's without the political commentary that's prevalent in previous Dylan albums, & his writing & composition's so matter-of-fact here. This, in my opinion, is Dylan's finest work since \\"Nashville Skyline\\", & that's saying a lot. If you're looking for a Dylan disc without all the social & political diatribe, this is the one for you! Pick up a copy of \\"Blood On The Tracks\\" ASAP!
B00008YJHC|5.0|i LOVE the pixies and bossanova  is one of the best cds !!! it's that cd you play at 90 0n the cd playing in the summer with ll of the windows open !!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I use to play this game as a child growing up and thought it would be fun to do again. I have gotten hooked playing this game once again.
B00CO52NLI|4.0|I really like this game but you can not  pet the guinea pigs or hamsters. The bunny are the only ones that you can brush and pet.
0142421715|2.0|This was just kind of boring. All it is is a lot of climbing and walking in a desert canyon. Nothing happens of any importance until the last third or so, when the gang runs into Hunter and subsequently becomes much more active. Ky was a selfish brat the whole time in this book, not actually doing anything to benefit Cassia, but only doing the whole \\"I love her so I'll keep everything a secret from her\\" thing. Cassia has green eyes, Indie has red-gold hair. It's less exciting when all YA books have those traits now. I really hope the third book is better than this one.
1781162646|5.0|Simply the best book ever. Hooked after the first few pages and read non stop till I finished! Great read for Stephen King fans and ones new to reading also
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This game took several hours to download. Just as the game started to get interesting it ended saying I needed to purchase the rest of the game. I knew it was going to happen just not so fast. I am going to unistall from my kindle. Thank heavens it was a free app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season three was outstanding, just as season 1 and 2 were also outstanding.  The acting and the writing are among the best ever for a television drama.  The only disappointment is that one of the main characters is killed off in this season (I won't say which one in case you have not yet had a chance to view it).  We can't wait for season 4.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie is very good . If you are that type of person that can watch a movie with out moving around getting up and down then this movie is for you. If you are the type that cant sit still then dont waste your time with this movie because you wont understand it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I HAVE enjoyed this game due to the different you can set up the tiles to different skill level. GOOD for  all ages and skill level s.
B00413QB5A|3.0|One of his first thrillers it does not have the fine attention to detail that one is used to with this author.
B000I543T6|5.0|What more can I say this movie sells it self. Al Pacino is the man he is my Idel I wish I could meet him. Al Pachino is the only person I idel and look up to.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I have never reviewed a book on kindle before but I feel as though I must honor this work of art. Anna and  the French kiss is my favorite book, hands down. Stephanie Perkins has perfected the teen aged love story. I have read and re-read it more times than I can count. And every time I read it, it never fails to make me swoon over Etienne or blush along with Anna.
B00820N2JG|5.0|I liked it because it was funny! Nobody is safe in this movie. Everybody is a target. Everyone has aids!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|I grew up in Brooklyn around these guys and it brang back memoreous for me. Their is a spot on smith and 9th street that I remember back in the days the mob use to hide their business in that place it blew my mind that they filmed that place. You can say this movie was based on a true story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so awesome that I would know how to escape. I love this game but it is kind of tricky.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I  have been having a great time with ebooks since I downloaded and installed Kindle for android.  I liked all the books I had gotten before but now I  have the choice of using 2 different filetypes of ebooks.  I like choices.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I love this app. Tennis is my favorite sport so I figured I would try a few tennis games out. I deleted 2 and kept this one. Most free apps suck but this one is good. Doesn't spam you with annoying ads like other free apps do. There are in game purchases but they are not required to play. Great work with this app. The controls are easy to use and the graphics and sound nice
159463176X|4.0|I liked this book. I'm not sure I understand why it was titled as it is, but I really liked the way the author explored multiple generations in the context of the political upheaval in the area. It is well written and offers a rich historical perspective I recommend it!
B0086B5R9Y|5.0|Very inspirational. Its a nice book and opens your mind to life in a different dimension. It is a great motivator.
B00992CF6W|5.0|hooooo my gosh this is the best game ever get it its wort the money just get it and you'll see
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Excellent exposure of what has happened to the food supply in this country and how we are being lied to and taken advantage of by food manufacturers.  Thanks McDonalds for creating the worst thing that ever happened to a country and the food we eat.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I have watched this movie numerous times and get tears at the end. Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston are the greatest together in this movie. Hearing Whitney sing gives me goose bumps. I still can't believe she's gone. There will never be a hauntingly great singer again.
B00BIR381W|4.0|I received the box set in good shape. The show is just really great. I can't stop watching it and I can't wait for the next season.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|A simple and easy, fun game for adults and kids alike. You can easily play without any kind of purchase.
B00C9G22R2|4.0|I have been waiting in great anticipation for a couple of years to finally see this film and it didn't disappoint. It's definetely a Wong Kar Wai classic.  The only complaints I would make about this dvd is that it is the shorter 120 minute version, instead of the 130 minute full version.  Also, the subtitles are not the best in interpretation.  Having seen the longer version, this is a major thing, as it leaves out much of the clarity of the plot and that's a major thing because Kar Wai is notoriously very vague in the details of his film storylines.  Minus these points, I love it as it definetly takes on the themes of the martial arts within the characters and is very beautiful in cinematography.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so cool it is just like despicable. Me the movie with the fart guns and all of that
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|I bought the 3D movie for my grandkids's visit 11 and 9 year old, we quit halfway through, we could not bear to watch another 90 minutes of a kid on a boat with a tiger. Being nominated for oscar must be the kiss of death or will be for me, never again!<br />I can not believe the number of 5 star ratings, they must be from India and England...
B004GYY714|5.0|Great app.. can take it anywhere I want.. Stations are good and plentiful.<br />Don't have to attached to any electric.. Love it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed this services a lot. I've read it at least a dozen times. I always find new details that bring the story to life for me.
B00D37UP4S|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and it was true to the novel that it was based upon.  The actors were believable and story flowed.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Love this app.  Nice to be able to change the colors on it.. for my eye sight is bad for certain ones
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my 5 year old had to teach me how to play this, but he loves it and thats all that matters
0470474874|5.0|This book is excellent for self teaching of Excel. I have never really had the need to use spreadsheets until recently and this book is great for beginners as well as advanced users. The CD is one of the features that sold me and I like the idea of having the templates and worksheets that I can download to my computer.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show just keeps getting better.  Has to be the funniest show on TV.  I've watched the shows over and over.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Im stuck on the second level and can not figure it out, it was fun doing the first level, took me a bit but I got it
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Fun game, however it takes some time to figure it all out.  The AI is pretty good and graphics are spectacular.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing!!  There were so many parts I didn't expect.  Every reader would love this, as long as they don't mind reading about blood or things like that.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minions&lt;3 R The Cutest Little Guys That Are So Kute!!! I Just Wanna Have One Or Own One(If They were Real) &lt;3 Great App
B00AYJBT66|5.0|If you enjoy Jimi Hendrix, buy this album.  Personally, I think it's the best of his studio recordings, and the mono vinyl pressing is unreal.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Simple to use and under stand. Needs to be more model specific.  Unsure why  my bid was higher than the final price.
B000VXJYFI|5.0|If you closed your eyes and dropped the needle on this record, you'd think you were sitting in the grass at a live Hendrix show.  Whether you're a fan of Jimi Hendrix or not, give this album a shot.  It's that good.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|So sad to see it end...wish it could go on forever and never stop.loved every book , and will continue to read over and over.
B007885IJU|5.0|I didn't expect much from this album.  Honestly, I bought it simply because I enjoyed &#34;Ho Hey&#34; so much and wanted to see what else The Lumineers had to offer.  Little did I know I'd become a lifetime fan of the band.  This is one of the best albums I've ever heard from start to finish.  The vinyl pressing does it justice.  Just buy it.  You'll be glad you did.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging but not too difficult for my spacy no mind. I enjoyed going back to game after I thought about it later.
B000HN3340|5.0|This album has a very raw, garage-band-like sound.  If you ever wondered what the Black Keys might sound like as young kids in the basement, this is as close as you'll get.  Personally, I love it.  Sounds great on vinyl.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Great movie love the smiths references. They did a great job pulling this together. love & rockets were also in there......
B0033AGPFS|5.0|This is a wonderful album, and a wonderful vinyl pressing.  The sound is amazing on my turntable.  If you're a fan of Hendrix, buy this album.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|First of all this thing is a beast and please be aware that it only comes with one fan! It's much better that the stock intel cooler. My temp dropped 10 deg and I saw an immediate improvement is system performance! It's worth every penny! One more plus! It's all metal hardware so no flimsy twist and turn plastic locks like you find on the stock cooler!
B004QSYSZ0|5.0|Our young daughter just loves playing with the Roundhouse - especially raising and lowering the middle!  It's a great addition to her Chuggington train set.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|The graphics rock and i love that you can have a dog!! Haha awesome game definetly recommend it for anyone! Its really fun!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|As a student, I've often read books, like suspense romance books, that did not require much thought. I have to say that these books required brain activity lol but I really enjoyed reading them!
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|This film is a good companion piece to all the other popular zombie movies out there. This is a very original, funny, touching and sometimes suspenseful. Very well acted by About a Boy star Nicholas Hoult, this is a story about one particular zombie that we hear from the beginning narrates his personal story. I can't give away too much here so I'll just say  I liked this film from the first 5 minutes and it was satisfying till the end.
B00B23Z2IE|5.0|I first became aware of Charles Bradley from the documentary Soul of America, which was excellent BTW, chronicling the release of his first album No Time for Dreaming.  I was captivated by his story and loved his sound that I searched for anything he'd released and picked up both albums.  Very soulful and heartfelt in every song, I am now a big fan of Mr. Bradley and will continue to follow him hopefully for many years to come.  Very reminiscent of James Brown, so if you're a fan check it out.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The game is fun, and well put together. however the puzzles aren't challenging enough. Also, the controls can be a bit touchy and it is difficult to turn around in some levels.
B004D0YB4Y|5.0|I first became aware of Mr. Bradley from the documentary Soul of America, which is excellent BTW, that chronicles the release of this album No Time for Dreaming.  I found his story captivating and his singing excellent so I searched out anything that he had released.  I picked this album up along with his second release Victim of Love and was not disappointed.  I find him very reminiscent of James Brown, so if you're a fan check it out.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My niece loves it, easy to understand and play. And helps with satisfying her love of horses. So far the free play part is great. Progresses well with out spending real money
B0076DELIG|5.0|It is simple, I read the book and wish the next Bosch Mystery was ready to read.  Nice to have a leading character that is not a super human.  And who knew Bosch could be a good role model for a child.
B000VX4X3G|5.0|One minor problem with the shoe was one of the laces broke immediately when tied the first time.  Other than that...  I have no complaints.  I'd buy the shoe again
B00CWY76CC|5.0|If you fancy yourself like a Sherlock Holmes, this will be the right fit.  But remember instructions are like cheats, so don't expect many at all
B00DFRVAC2|4.0|Since listening to the first or original Iron Man movie soundtrack, I have been very impressed with the quality of music that Ramin Djawadi brings to feature films and even television.  So whether it's Game of Thrones, Iron Man, or even the Pacific Rim soundtrack, he manages to make his music both fitting and unique to each associated show.  With the Pacific Rim soundtrack, each song has a unique vibe and feel, especially the first song, which gives you a feeling that this movie will be both heroic and epic.  While one or two songs seem to be a mix up of two other songs from the track list, they are still a great.  Just listening to the soundtrack makes me want to see this movie even more.  In my mind and opinion, there are three things that can make a movie great; that being the storyline, characters or character development, and the soundtrack.  While this movie isn't out yet, it definitely has a great soundtrack going for it.  If I was ever to do a TV show or movie, I would love to have Ramin Djawadi do my original soundtrack for it, only to be tied with Hans Zimmer.<br /><br />My two favorite songs are &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; and &#34;Go Big or Go Extinct.&#34;  However, both songs sound very similar to each other in the beginning to middle.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Took a while to download but it is a really good game loved it. They should come out with halo for kindle fire HD
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Not quite the fairy tales I remember, but it's fun to watch and I'm looking forward to next season.  Can't wait to find out who the shadow is...
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Not the best computer animation but you can look past it in this movie. I would watch it again but on a rainy day to fill time.
B003ES5ZTG|4.0|I use this cable for connecting my laptop to my tv at home and also carry it around for use at other peoples houses or hotels.  Wherever I might be needing some entertainment.  The swivel function works well to keep stress off of the cable and gives you a better way to position whatever you are hooking it to.  Good cable would like to buy an extra but they don't have them anymore.<br /><br />So far it has been good and hopefully it will stand the test of time.
B001LM1456|3.0|I watched this film to complete my viewing of the films related to the avengers series and although I did not love this film the actors were great and the story far overshadowed the first mistake
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is so much fun but you need to have brains I wish they made this game for D<br />s or 3ds
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A great book delightfully written. You may believe everything it says or not, anyway it is guaranteed to lift up your spirit by returning your focus into life's good things.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love these games just wish they lasted longer, could play them for hours and hours! I am going to try them all, and recommend to everyone.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Very solid build quality. Like reviews state, it blocks the cartridge slot, so be aware of that before you buy. Not all games support it. I bought it for user with Kid Icarus, but the developer of Kid Icarus was lazy and thus it's only useful for lefties (the right control stick does the same thing as the left). But that's not a problem with this pad. It has a solid build, comes with one AAA battery (a little puzzling to me why it doesn't run off the 3DS's battery, but whatevs) and feels good.
B00CRMWMZ0|2.0|I love good dance music and therefore I love Daft Punk. Or so I thought.<br /><br />Random Access Memories is mostly a collection of tracks that sound like bad 70's love songs; lounge music for people unaware that better music exists and with no need for a beat. The melodies are aweful and predictable, the beats are soft and uninteresting, and many of the tracks feature samples that sound like avant-guard jazz... which I guess is fine if you like music that sounds like people just jamming out with no purpose in mind. Bad if you want to bob your head to a good beat.<br /><br />I am giving the album two stars because mixed in with all the one-star tracks are a few five-star tracks. Get Lucky is obviously a great single and is already a club anthem. Lose Yourself to Dance is probably going to be the next single from the album and is, in my opinion, the best track on R.A.M. Georgio and Give Life Back to Music are probably both solid four-star tracks.<br /><br />Bottom line: Don't buy this album, just buy the tracks that you like. And if you don't like the 15 or 20 second sample that you hear, don't think the rest of the track is going to be any better.
B00CTEMQLG|5.0|This show was fun to watch. I really want to see the next season already. It is too bad they cancelled this show.
0525478817|5.0|This has spent a ton of time on the NYT best sellers list for a reason. John Green nailed it with this one, and mine came signed by some dude named J scribble. DFTBA
B003X73QA8|5.0|This is one of the few albums that hangs together as a concept. Arcade Fire craft superior songs and nestle them together so they fit just right. The textures and melodies are so fine.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|get candy crush saga its a must have and its extra cool playing on kindle guarantee. to make a bunch of money
B004TACMZ8|4.0|A tool that Every Electrician Should Have in their Tool Box !!!! I would Recommend it to Anyone that Works in the Electrical Field !!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I would give 0 if I could! Ever since my Motorola Electrify updated to Facebook 3.3 I am no longer able to upload photos. 3.4 did not fix this issue. Give me back a WORKING Facebook app! Stop messing w everything &amp; screwing up new things!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Good special effects.<br />Good actors.<br />Negatives, I thought it was a slow progression of plot.<br />Three people in house over 17 and no one gave over 3 stars.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I downloaded this app and purchased a couple of songs and walla!  Much to my happy surprise, Amazon put an album on the player that I had purchased from them in 2007. How great it is to know that I can purchase any music cd from Amazon and they will automatically download it to my player. Thanks again Amazon!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game has been challenging but fun too. My children and I have all enjoyed it and are hoping for more rooms soon.
B00A4B9A1U|4.0|Some of us don't want to know how things really are. It takes an effort to consider that we are not what we say we are. If you are comfortable with your world view being shaped by others and want to sleep easy at night don't read this book. If it is a mirror then we are complicit in a legion of crimes against humanity and our own citizens. There is some insight into when and where our values evaporated. I listened to Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick discussing the book and companion TV series and they remain optimistic about things changing for the better.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Good, quick read recommended for women ages 20-40.  The main character discovers her past and heals from an abusive relationship with her father while finding love through a boy who knew her then and now.
B0012GMW0C|5.0|Journey was formed in 1973 and featured Gregg Rolie with Neal Schon formerly of Santana and Ross Valory with George Tickner from Frumious Bandersnatch. The original lineup also included Prairie Prince who would be replaced by British drummer Aynsley Dunbar. The band cut their first album for Columbia in late 1974 at CBS Studios in San Francisco working with former Simon and Garfunkel producer Roy Halee. The album was released in April 1975. It includes quite a few standouts like Mystery Mountain, Topaz, Kohoutek as well as one of, if not, my favorite Journey song, Of A Lifetime.
B00CATSONE|3.0|A bit unfulfilling for me, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />I was looking forward to really learning about this man's life, but it seems to be more of an &#34;inspirational&#34; lead to promote another agenda, perhaps another book.
B001G9LV9S|5.0|Cat Stevens Tea for the Tillerman was first released on November 23, 1970 and found Cat hitting his stride in fine style. From the opening Where Do the Children Play? to the ending Tea for the Tillerman, there isn't a weak song on this album. The extra disc comes with a couple of demos and a few live songs. The overall length is a bit of a disappointment as both discs could've easily fit on one but the package is well designed and the booklet it nice. While would've liked a few extra songs on the second disc, I also understand that maybe there isn't that much stuff in the vault that hasn't been released. I purchased the Deluxe version of the album new for about what a normal cd would cost. I'm very happy with it even though I already pretty much had everything on here. Not to be passed up!
B0046B1KHG|4.0|I really really Love the Minions.  Great entertaining animated movie for both kids and adults alike.  Highly recommend Despicable Me.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I truly loved the relationship between Emily and Chris. It reminds me of the relationship between me and my best friend growing up. I think he would have done the same thing for me had I asked. A must read for anybody who has a true best friend.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I watched the whole series and love that the voice actors did the voices! The game itself is fun and easy, though difficult if you don't have friends who play the game.<br />Over all a great game for MLP fans.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoy these games but do not like spending money for a game that just lasts a few hours. Fun story though.
030758836X|2.0|I got a copy of \\"Gone Girl\\" about two months ago.  I started reading it almost instantly because of the good reviews I had read in the media. It took me more than a month to finish it.  For me it was very predictable. I was able to guess what was going to happen until the very end. I have to admit that the ending was unexpected but unsatisfying at the same time.  It was really hard (almost impossible) to identify with or even like any of the characters in the lead and there was too much profanity in the prose which made the reading quite uncomfortable at times. The novel was very successful so it must come down to a matter of personal taste.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Strong background, excellent flow, and very impressive effects. Mr Spock still kicks ass both young and old, and Kirk is a badass. Just trying to fill the minimum review length.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great book and look into the man they call Steve Jobs. Couldn't put this book down from cover to cover.
B005IS565S|5.0|What a great album! I've never heard the explicit versions of these songs, only the censored ones, and WOW! So much better!
0060245867|4.0|Cute book with a lesson that can be applied to many things.  Personally, I'll use it as a sermon illustration.
B00499QUK2|5.0|The update is really very good. The chemistry between the two leads is great. Cumberbatch is one of the best Holmes ever. I hope they do more in this series.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game runs smooth on my kindle, acts just like the 360 version of the game. If you are a recreational user of the game you will probably thoroughly enjoy this. I really enjoy 2014 games and cards offered.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Hitler's armies are invading France. The British are bracing for war. There is a prize at stake - the French Fleet, the fourth largest naval power in the world. If the Germans get to it first, they would be in a position to threaten the British dominance at sea. Admiral Darlan, the commander of the French Fleet, is holding out for the best offer. No matter who it comes from.<br /><br />From our modern point of view, it seems like a done deal that the French should have taken the British side in the conflict - weren't they allies in WWII? In reality, the things were much more complicated. From the position of the French, both the Germans and the British were potential enemies, long-standing rivals; surrendering the Fleet to either of them would have been unacceptable. To top it off, Admiral Darlan has his own dreams of the world domination, with France and, more importantly, himself at the top of the food-chain. If only he'd play his cards right...<br /><br />Young Ian Fleming, agent \\"17F\\" of the British Naval Intelligence, would have none of that. He discovers the hidden location of the French Fleet and is consequentially dispatched by the British government to make an offer to Admiral Darlan. Armed with a few spy gadgets, a reliable, if new to him M1911, and a sizable sum of money to be used as a bribe, he and a supporting wireless operator are to be parachuted to the Pyrenees in a precision drop. Yet nothing ever goes smoothly in the spy business...<br /><br />In the best James Bond tradition the story has double-crosses, beautiful women, chases, escapes, villains, fights to the death, exotic locations, you name it. Lots of attention is given to the smallest of details, just like in the Bond books. The weapons, the cars, the gadgets, even the clothes are described to create that atmospheric feeling that James Bond books and movies always deliver.<br /><br />In the beginning, the author stipulates: \\"There have been much speculation as to who was the inspiration for Commander Bond and it is my hope that `The Ian Fleming Files' books will put an end to this debate.\\" I think this book makes a very convincing argument in answering this question.<br /><br />This is an engaging read from start to finish, well researched, and fast-paced.<br /><br />Recommended.Commander Bond and it is my hope that `The Ian Fleming Files' books will put an end to this debate.\\" I think this book makes a very convincing argument in answering this question.<br /><br />This is an engaging read from start to finish, well researched, and fast-paced.<br /><br />Recommended.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Good humor, good characters, pretty good animation that is consistent, and an engaging story. Not to mention the minions! They are the best part hands down.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|It was a little more geared to kids than I thought but still good. Probably wont watch again but entertaining.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this radio. I listen to it everynight. It carries radio stations all over the world along with<br />My own local radio stations. I recommend everyone give it a (listen) try.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|It was entertaining all the way through. A must see.  Bradley Cooper's acting was superb.  Could have used a little less profanity.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Use to play this on Facebook, but my laptop became slow( NOT because of this) so I stop playing, but I was sooo  happy  when  I saw it here. Go amazon for getting this!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Absolutely loved this book. The fairy tale told at the beginning of the book on the trip to the city captured my heart. Understanding the significance of this story further in the book nearly broke my heart. We have just added it as one of our book club selections for this fall.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Tangled is the perfect escape -- a funny page-turner that will put you in a good mood.  It was refreshing to have the story told from a male POV and he definitely made me laugh.  I look forward to Emma Chase's next book.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Very good book, kept me tuned in 100% of the time. I would really like to see a movie on this book!!
B007B5EDEG|2.0|I watched the TV series and really like it, so I decided to buy the whole series, but it was a total disappointment. There are so many repetitions, making it monotonous after a while.<br />I did not finish the book.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Great Movie, that I have watched many times before. Unfortunately, I'm new to Amazon Prime and I was unable to view on my smart TV. It did not stream. Ouch!
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|I started the book and could not put it down. It was the 1st book of Kate Morton I read, but it won't be the last.<br />I love the finale, it was so unexpected. The whole book is intriguing, the more I read the more I become hooked into the personalities of Laurel, Vivien and Dorothy. I prayed so much that the criminal act committed by Laurel's mother doesn't make her a bad person, that there is a plausible reason behind it. because the description of Laurel's is one of the perfect mother, loving and caring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a wonderful and fun game I totally recommend it for all ages! This game takes good eye and hand coordination.:)
B00845PT18|2.0|It's not the worst super hero movie ever made, but it's still not very good. A lot of the two director's ideas for Ghost Rider are just lame. His skull is less flaming than it was in the first film, he walks oddly like he's drunk, his cheesy visual illusions are pointless & stupid, his demonic stair looks way less cool than it did in the first movie or in the comics. It was even better looking as a Super move in that crappy Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 game. Also, even with the cheap ability to now simply touch someone to set them on fire, it seems rather easy to kick this drunken Ghost Rider's butt.<br /><br />The only cool they added to Ghost Rider is an ability to touch & turn vehicles into demonic weapons that Ghost Rider can then control, but it doesn't save the movie. The plot isn't too bad by most comic book movie standards, but the writing is kind of dull & the film can be rather slow at times. The Ghost Rider's host, Johnny Blaze (played by Nicolas Cage), isn't a very interesting character to watch other than the ocassional & halarious mental break down.<br /><br />So far, I actually like the filming style of the film's two director's (Taylor & Neveldine) in other films like Crank & Gamer, but I think they could have done way better with Ghost Rider. Overall, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengence isn't the worst, but its not really good. Costing about $10 to stream it for rent on Amazon Instat Video, it's really hard to recommend this film as even a rental. I'd rather watch something else like, for example, even the first Ghost Rider movie. Maybe if Ghost Rider laid off the alcohol, this sequel would be a better movie.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I was surprised how easily this synced to my google calendar.<br /><br />It is visually better than the real one and very easy to change the fonts on the calendar--a real plus for my 90 year old mother!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|one of the most fun young adult friendly movie ever made, the truffle shuffle will never get old!! GOONIES RULE!!!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The writing is great, as is the acting. The storyline is interesting. And it is great to see how an older generation comes to grips with &#34;modern&#34; day change.
0545091020|5.0|I really like the paperback copies so I decided to also get the audio books for when I didn't feel like reading.  The lady who does the reading  does a good job and her voice seems like it was the perfect one for the job.
B006CHML4I|5.0|dial is a bit small for my wrist but a great piece otherwise. easily adjustible for comfort and to set date and time.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|They really should update this version for android. Popcap/EA recently released a $.99 version of PvZ that has the bonus content like Zen Garden and Endless Survival mode. I wish I waited for that one.<br /><br />Otherwise a fantastic tower-defense game!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|have no doubt.  This season is just as good as the first season.  Can't wait for season three!  We are hooked.
B001JNNDE2|5.0|Great movie. Looks even better in blu ray. Takes a few watches to fully appreciate, but it never gets old.<br /><br />Get your own tots!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Addicting. I love this show. I would recommend it for both women and men a like. Can't wait for the next season.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of the best series on tv.  I did not like the ending of the latest season but understood he wanted to do other things.  Cannot wait until the new season starts.
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|If you want to truly understand news broadcasting in the 21st century this film will explain it all. Nothing has changed in society in nearly 4 decades. Stellar performances by this cast, Faye Dunaway is at her best showing her strength as a producer in a man's world. Lumet makes solid choices as the director by not having a score or background music, pulling you deep into the dialogue and the emotions of these characters.
145210655X|5.0|This book takes on a different look at Darth Vader's fatherly skills. I think it is a fun book for kids and adults, perfect for a father to read to his son. (And there's a princess Leia on too!)
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|first when I saw this game it looked kidish then when I got it I wan speach less.  this game is one of the best shooting games for the kindle fire.  I recommend a lot of gamers to get it.
B000VRIQ58|4.0|While there are some aspects of Third Stage that sound like their initial album, you can tell that the band has grown in their sound. I've wanted this album for a long time, and am glad I finally took the time to look it up and download it!
B00509OFE8|5.0|One of the best GOOD sci fi series ever produced. The 1st season was not slow, one had to enter the awe and concept of being aboard an ancients finest ship created and get in touch with characters that later explained a lot of the decisions they made independently. Season 2 was all out great sci fi, shows about new current theories that I am sure will mainfest like a star trek communication device. They killed it by airing in a new death time slot. I demand a final 2 hour movie if they dont have the guts to start the series up again. Good sci fi too close to truth always gets axed, BBC's Outcasts, Dark Angel etc yet dumb sci fi Hollywood movies like Pacific rim, battle ship, Super 8 etc with millions of dollars wasted on dumbed down flouride sheople are hits.
B001NA6096|5.0|This is love you don't forget, ever.  The night you look back on when you are well on in  years.  Young American male in Vienna for the afternoon and night (flying out the next a.m., hence the title) meets a young Frenchwoman traveling home to Paris after a family visit. They connect, she gets off with him in Vienna and spends the remainder of their hours discussing love, life, interests, thoughts, relationships etc.  A true communication.<br /><br />The film is lovely. slice of life in an evening.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This is the best first person shooter ever made by gameloft. It is worth the money. People sometimes say its so bad because they are jealous.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Kept me wanting to never stop reading.  Quite a twist at the end...  cant wait to read the rest of the series
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|A very funny, personal memoir, but I was expecting a lot more about SNL and 30 Rock.  The book is more about Fey's personal life than anything.  If you're looking for behind the scenes of SNL stories, try \\"Live from New York\\" or \\"Gasping for Airtime.\\"
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love thus game have made lots of new friends playing in all the different cities. Would live yo see a Vegas took dknetiine soon plx
B008QTVNUI|5.0|We are ex military, patriotic and find it hard to believe what some will do in the name of justice!  It was very moving and understandable how some were brainwashed and tortured till they &#34;turn&#34; toward the enemy.  I hope there is a follow-on to the story.  We hope to see the Sgt. make a real change and become a patriotic politician.  It left us with unanswered questions but we enjoyed every minute of the series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautifully shot and acted. Loved every minute of watching it. Highly recommended and addicting show! Can't wait for season 4 to come out.
B001NA60A0|4.0|acting was wonderful  Ethan  HAWKE AND Julie Delpy have a  great chemistry together  This is a must see movie  Please let me log off now..
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show! loved watching the entire season without commercials and without having to wait for the following week to see what happens next!
B008YZ4RR0|4.0|Great story line. I like watching movie series in order so I would start with Night Passage, which I give a 5*.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I know it is compatible with all software that supports standard NMEA codes. As a developer or experimenter I plugged it into a raspberry pi Linux computer and it shows up as a USB Serial port. When you open the serial port the device is spitting out NMEA codes continuously. These defined strings contain information like what time it is, where you are, speed and heading, the number of satellites it's connected to and so on. The default baud rate is 4800. If you raise the baud rate through its programming interface you get more (different) data strings but I didn't try this. There's a binary mode also to access more data, perhaps a stratum clock, not tested either. I bought it to direct light at one spot all day using a tracking mirror. Basically I used it as a clock, and the longitude and latitude was used too, but this doesn't change so I could have programmed that in rather than read it from GPS. But for $24 why not?
B008B68IV8|5.0|I bought this for my niece and she loves it. had it out if the box as soon as she received it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I exhausted all the episodes and can't wait for the new season. The final episode took my breath away! OMG!<br />I was stunned. My heart is breaking for Mary. What next for the family!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Humbug oftc couscous council couscous it tofu Couric co.  Co  it Yves acc uhh xxx if xxx.  Dutch yucky.  Pimlico cu oh luv .
B006LSZECO|2.0|This novel got a bit boring for me and I did not care for the way Gillian Flynn ended this story. I don't care much for fiction anyway.
B008LXZFH6|5.0|Will Ferrell and Steve Carell at the top of their game.  this is a hilarious fell good comedy and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|There's a lot of hype surrounding this book, and admittedly I didn't initially choose to read it to learn but to see if it was worth the fuss. Although not terribly well written, there are more than a few teachings that I'm applying in my life. If you're a professional young woman, this is a great read.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|This is probably the worst scrolling shooter I have ever seen. I am sorry I even wasted my download time. Whoever wrote the ad for this is crazy.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|So far this game is very interesting. Love all the colors and different things to do. I just started the game so we will see how the rest goes
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the movie.now I love the game.something me an the kids can get n2.adults will love it also.I can play all day
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Got the free trial, played it one day and paid for the full game. I stopped playing the card game several years ago, and this is a cheap way to get back into it! Don't have to buy a bazillion cards, etc. Works well on the Kindle Fire HD (it has crashed once, perhaps overheating).
B009R659L8|4.0|Great story I have read all of books and never been disapointed keep em comin and hurry because I can't wait for the next one
0763644765|4.0|Though the kid refuses to use the potty (unlike his sister, who was almost fully potty trained at 13 months), he likes this book. It is a simple and illustrative way to make children more comfy with the idea of the potty.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I usually don't like dated shows, but this one is really good.  It keeps you wanting more.  Can't wait for the next season!
B004HO6I4W|5.0|My toddler son loves the music and want us to put it in all the time. It is so convient to have a BLu-Ray copy for the living room and DVD for their room!
B005H9B44A|5.0|Thor was never my favorite comic book character, all brawn and no brain. Plus, the whole split personality thing (He's actually Donald Blake being possessed by Thor) was kind of silly. &#34;Thor&#34; is a great flick. The story is solid and the characters are compelling, and its funny to boot.
B007MDB71O|5.0|The title of the review says it all. It doesn't have anything objectionable in it and the action is exciting. The plot keeps you guessing and wanting more the whole way through.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it so cool I love playing 24/7hours day so cool you should relly get this game
B00CATSONE|3.0|This book is more about creativity than about Tesla. It uses a brief history of Tesla to make illustrations, but the main point is about being creative.  It's a quick read,and good to inspire.
B0063M22QO|3.0|The quality of the game is decent, but not what I expected from an app that is paid for. It looks like it should have been a free app.
B005E89X7E|5.0|For any one with a spirit for historical adventure, fantasy, chivelry. The author takes you on a tour through a bit of history while telling the story of the main character. Though he never allows you te guess wat is coming next. A brilliant story teller.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have had the weather channel on my computer, on my phone, and on my tablet and have loved it... until last week when they changed it. Late June or early July 2013. Now I can't navigate through it without it telling me that I'm earning points by checking on things. I don't want to play weather, I want to check it and be done with it!
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Batman came alive when Christian Bale moved into the role. Before it was a joke. This is a continuation of the Dark Knight series, and it's another good one. Only two things could have made it better. If Heath Ledger had still been alive to play the villain, and if Katie Holmes was the girl (I'm a huge fan of hers), but Maggie Gyllenhaal is great in the role. And then there's Morgan Freeman. That's all that needs to be said about him.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|thoroughly enjoyed, saw in theatres couple times, unfortuneately bought dvd with skip used, yikes, but couldn't believe hugh jackman could sing and Russell Crowe, great job!
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Great series.  Wish they would have ended it better on the last season.  Looks like this is the trend for networks like cbs, fox.
B00000JRTX|2.0|long arduous story, could be some people's real life, more depressing, and full of lifes ironies, but why go for the girl that sleeps around everywhere and think things will work?
B000EULJLU|5.0|When I first listened to this album I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. I was a casual Tool fan and had only heard their music on the radio. The best way to enjoy this album is to listen to it from start to finish in one sitting. The songs tell a story and the long instrumental bits help to paint a vivid picture. I now consider myself a fan and not just a &#34;casual fan&#34;. If you are thinking about buying this album for any reason, do it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I run a child care center and even my 3+year olds enjoy playing this game. I my self have spent much time playing it. great game for all!
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|temple run meets zombies. and guns! oh and dogs Robt forget dogs, plus corn and fog and zombies and dogs and zombies,  but mostly guns and running and dogs and zombies
B0041KVW2K|4.0|First, I am not going to comment on the content of these albums other than to remind everyone these are the UK versions of the albums.  For instance &#34;Help!&#34; is not the movie soundtrack issued in the US, it is the UK album &#34;Help!&#34; from 1965.  I assume anyone considering spending $370 for these albums already knows and likes the music.<br /><br />Second, the bad news is minor but annoying.  The albums are packaged in a black case describing the contents and included a sturdy plastic frame inside to protect the records.  It would have made a very nice shelf display except it was not shipped in an additional box.  The case was scuffed and damaged and splattered with shipping labels.  One of the album jackets had bent corners that did not affect the record inside.  Mine came from Big_Box_Bargains and I would highly recommend they ship these in a simple $2 box.  This is the only reason this product did not receive the highest rating from me.<br /><br />Third, and again this is minor, the surface of the record jackets are very glossy.  Be sure your hands are clean and oil free or there will be finger prints all over these jackets.  This is also true of the enclosed book which has many photos and much of the text in very high gloss.<br /><br />Finally the vinyl records. Not a click, pop, skip or warped record in the bunch.  And I listened to every track (yes, including the entire &#34;Yellow Submarine&#34; album) on every record.  I did notice on a couple of the earlier albums the fit of the hole for the spindle was a little tight.  If the record was not seated all the way down on the turntable platter the record appeared to be warped.  Suggest everyone make sure the record is seated firmly to the platter before dropping the stylus.<br /><br />This is a terrific set of fantastic music and nothing in the digital world compares to vinyl on a quality turntable through a nice stereo system.  Put your headphones on and enjoy!
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|This one is  a keeper.  These two guys are very entertaining.  I you have liked other Grisham movies you will like this one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Another great season...leaving me to wait in anticipation for more of the Crowleys and their lovable and not so loveable downstairs staff.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really did love this app. It was fun, simple, and you could actually move further up in the game without paying money. The only little issue I have is how we can't earn any jewels.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I remember seeing this series when it originally aired and I fell in love with it.  When I found that Amazon had all in seasons I again started watching it and fell in love with it all over again.  Already in Season 3 and loving it!  If you are interested in police procedural shows, you'll love this one.  It's gritty but so real!
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|This is not a normal film.  If anyone comes at it thinking they'll be given a clear, linear narrative will be sorely disappointed.  The seven stories don't even connect in a straightforward way, and it's up to the viewer to see the echoes through time.  The story makes ripples, not waves with each story skipping off each other and sometimes only ancillary or seemingly arbitrary details are the only obvious connections the viewer can make.  The way the movie whispers, not shouts, its grand plot makes it far more compelling than the simple narratives so common in big-budget films today.<br /><br />The seven stories as told are compelling in their own right, and made largely so by an excellent ensemble cast and for the most part the cast slips easily between roles.  Practically every cast member plays more than one character, with certain actors having roles in all seven stories.  Although Hanks does seem to have to most fluid performance he never really outshines anyone else in the cast.<br /><br />Great visual effects and a good score are usually givens in Wachowski films, and here they do not disappoint.  The Neo Seoul scenes are nothing original in sci-fi but they are very well fleshed out and rendered, even if some of the makeup used to make some western actors look Asian does look a bit forced.<br /><br />TL;DR, if you hated The Fountain you'll hate this.  If you loved The Fountain you'll probably love this.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|Excellent read!  Couldn't put it down.  Sad yet uplifting at the same time.  It truly reveals the love a mother has for a child.  Lovely.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Excellent movie about Iran in the 70s. I lived there in 1975-77 and left just before the Shaw did.<br />The buildings, people and other background were what I saw when I was there. However, the<br />people of Iran are like all people, here in the US and the world. I found that they were friendly<br />always wanted to try speaking English to you and liked America and wanted to go the  U. S. A. more<br />than any other country in the world. My heart is sad for all those people and what they have<br />had to indue over the years. I worked in the oil fields in Hawaz and toiled and slaved along<br />with them for the big oil companies. I say...ho-offic  Jack
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Favorite keyboard on Android by far. Would like a few more themes, but no complaints other than that. Flow feature works nicely and the predictions really come in handy!
B0094K1K42|3.0|I was expecting a light-hearted comedy, which this was not.  There were some funny lines, but overall this film was a dud.
0811833887|5.0|Any artist should know that &#34;Art of (Pixar movie)&#34; books will always be amazing.  It's such a treat getting to see inside the story, characters, and process of Pixar's movies, and you could never go wrong with one of the books.
B002I8PVQA|3.0|I'm an Ed Norton fan.  The movies was well done, edging on the nostalgic, with a familiar cast and even a Marlon Brando chin-flick for good measure.  The plot was simple and predictable, but I enjoyed watching to see how my predictions would play out.  All-in-all, it's worth watching once.
1595825045|5.0|As an artist, I have too many art/drawings books to count.  This is BY FAR the best book I have ever gotten.  This book will be open sitting next to me EVERY time I draw.<br /><br />Every single page in this book is a new beautiful piece of art.  I can't even single out specific parts because every one is amazing.<br /><br />If you are an artist (or fan of this series) it is mandatory that you own this.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Everybody knows that you need Adobe Reader to &#34;read&#34; stuff. It's great the Adobe Reader comes in &#34;tablet&#34; form. Done.
145211207X|5.0|Any artist should know that &#34;Art of (Pixar movie)&#34; books will always be amazing.  It's such a treat getting to see inside the story, characters, and process of Pixar's movies, and you could never go wrong with one of the books.
B004SBX112|5.0|I play it every night. Fun and frustrating but it helps me relax. I only wish there were better instructions on game objective.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome I am going to have the game forever am I right or am I not right!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I only stumbled upon the free angry birds while searching for stuff to buy. Having lots of fun playing at night.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought that this book was one of the best books I have ever read. But I disliked how so many people died like prim and gimmick.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Doesn't everybody like angry birds? It's definitely a challenge...but it wouldn't be fun otherwise. I only wish the games came with a quick explanation of game play...what to look for.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|Nothing memorable about this work. I found it rather tedious at best. I feel that neither the music, nor the acting, nor the singing are particularly good.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Without the Media Player...the Kindle Fire would otherwise be useless other than reading books. It's so nice that you can read books and surf the web...and I think 'Pulse' wouldn't work so well :-)
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Horrible. Beautiful. I needed to know this about Afghanistan. To understand what the people were feeling and living. I will remember. Everyone should read this book.
B005SHTXN0|4.0|Dustin Hoffman (Ray) had to have a hard time staying in character&#62; Tom Cruse did a good job as brother the way he melode out thru movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great! This game is very addictive and entertaining! This game is a must have for all ages! One of the best aspects is that it's FREE! Nothing better than cheap entertainment and something anyone can actually enjoy!
630529142X|3.0|I would have rated it higher but I really just do not like Adam Sandler's acting. I am not a fan, but needed the DVD.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series. My only frustration with this story is that I have o wait for the next book to come out.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I've seen this movie before and no matter how many times I see it, it still give me the willies.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Have not finished it yet, but typical of the series. Engaging, draws you in, feel like you;re there with Jack. Love this series.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|YOU KEEP GOING BACK FOR MORE!!<br />GOOD READ, WOULD RECOMMEND TO ALL.<br />CONTAINS A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING.<br />WELL WRITTEN.
B00457X8BC|4.0|so was interested in the author's vision of the city.  Turns out he had not been there.  Oh, well, it was still a good read.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I thought the trip advisor was a great help while I was on vacation in May. I will continue to use it.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I bought this as a replacement for the kids as they broke there first copy. They were so upset as this is a cherrished movie.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Easy to use &amp; we love that there are additional puzzle packs you can download.<br />Even our 3 year old loves to play!
B0059WTMLW|4.0|It is fun to play this game.  It has games for all level of play.  I am only a beginner, but can see the challenge games yet to come.
B005VMSATA|5.0|Besides some volume issues watching this on the ps3 with amazon instant video Both me and my wife thought this was a great movie, so I do not really understand all the bad reviews this movie gets.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have read all 3 of these books amd have loved them all! I kust say that the ending to this book was nothing like I expected..... I read it on my phone and when I flipped the page it was just over :( so that is the only thing I didn't like. In other words please bring the next one out soon!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|The bad reviews are saying that you will be fooled by the game. NO!!!!! That's no doubt it's a lie those reviews. This game is fun and the violence in this game isn't bad actually. Hate the freakin stupid lying stinkin bad reviews!!!! They make me feel sooo irritated!!! Some of the bad reviews don't even make sense of how this fun game is bad or BORIN!!!!!!!! Heck this games great and OK for girls and great for young boyz like my brother.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A beautiful novel.  A quick read that I couldn't put down.  Actually read it in one day.  Wished the story had kept going.
B001GUXJQA|3.0|Having read 8. of mr. Connely's Harry Bosh books, I am still very much an admirer of his story telling literary skills, but this is not his best effort, and not remotely near his GREAT efforts writing &#34;Echo Park.&#34;<br /><br />Daren Johnson
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This author is always a guarantee. Love that there was an electronic version I could download. Being able to enjoy a great book at all times is wonderful!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I read this book the year it came out.  It is a more complicated book than I usually read but really got into it about midway through.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great read! Kept me wanting more!<br />I did not want it to end and when a book does that for me then it gets a 5!!!!!!!!
B0000042HV|5.0|The self-effacing Fitzwilliam Quartet's players do not have their individual names listed anywhere on the box or in the program booklet of this fine set of Shostakovich's quartets.  From the photographs on their website, I would reckon that some of the current players were not members in the mid 1970's, when these recordings were made. Shostakovich had been impressed by the group, and he entrusted to them the first performances of his last three quartets.  I haven't played all the way through the box, but I have sampled music from different stages in the composer's career, and the performances are uniformly excellent.  The Decca sound does them justice too, so if you're looking for a bargain (around $5.00 a disc) or just an alternative to the Emerson's much-praised set, you needn't hesitate.  This is absorbing and accessible music, played with concentration and commitment.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I liked this take on Jack and the Bean Stalk. It was probably one of my favorite of the Grimm brother re-makes that Hollywood has done! Had great action scenes and special effects, loved how the giants looked and that how they incorporated the ever famous FI FY FO FUM!! It is definitely worth watching.
B00AB7IA1S|2.0|This game simply doesn't exist. It is way too easy. I'm not kidding: I \\"blew through\\" the whole thing in less than one hour. Once you get it it just \\"clicks\\" and becomes so obvious that's it is like solving a simple maze each time. I wanted to rate it higher but since they are normally charging money for it I just can't because a game without gameplay isn't a game at all. How can I give it a good rating when they left out the most critical part?
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I liked the new perspective this movie gave me on how the wizard of oz and the wicked witches came to be. It was pretty well done, kind of has an artsy/theatrical side to it, but I like that.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I just loved it. I loved the characters and the mix of myth and real world troubles. I totally lost myself in the story. Thank you for providing me with a wonderful escape.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|This movie to me is just okay because it so predictable. I'm not a huge fan of movies where if you've seen one you've seen them all. It only scored 3 stars because the action was good and kept me entertained enough to not turn it off.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun. I can't stop! Some times it's a bit glitchy but other than that I love this game! The cute characters and the challenges make this my favourite game!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app , such wonderful ideas from all around the world, possibilities are unlimited . very addictive . could stay on for hours. my favorite all time site.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Unique and intelligent ideas,  humorous, interesting characters and view of the future.  What science-fiction should be.  You should watch it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I could. spend. hours playing temple run. great fun. I recommend it for anyone wanting to play an exciting game.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very well written and has a good pace.  Has some great perspective on how the raid occurs and turned out to be a good book.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed the book I read it in two days which is a record for me. i'll try more of his books
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book is well written and has a great set of characters and the story keeps up a good pace.
1439181780|5.0|This book is nothing short of life changing.  I needed something light and uplifting to read over the weekend, and I'm so glad I picked this book up.  It was even more practical and inspiring than the Secret!  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered extra copies for friends and family so they could be touched by it too.  An absolute must read!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I wanted to read this after hearing such great things about it, and seeing it on the top of the charts for so long. I am still reading it, but really like it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was an awesome book. I can't wait for the final 2 so I can see how everything works out! Sylvia Day is a great author!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I read the Maze Runner, and immediately bought this second book. The story is so good, that I could not wait to know what happens next. I still find the Maze Runner to be a better book than this one, more interesesting, adventurous, unexpected. But also this book delivers, and by the time you are reading this book you will be familiar with the characters, love the story and will not be able to stop reading it.<br />It starts exactly where the first book finishes, with all of the team waiting to know what Wicked is, being now outside the Maze. This book gives a new twist to the story, a new trail which they have to complete in order to get to their save haven. Thomas and the team meet new people, new challenges while they need to survive crossing this unexpected city, and working as a team to get to their final destination. New characters, new variables, the storyline is good, this is the type of story that makes me feel I am living it and always wanting to know more. At this point, I cannot wait to read book three.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Daniel Day-Lewis was awesome. Sally Field was great too, as were Tommy Lee Jones and David Strathairn.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I had this book on my wishlist for too long, I finally decided to read it once I saw a poster for the movie and got intrigued, and it was a great decision. I have always loved this type of books and the story delivers.<br />It is about a group of boys living inside a maze, not knowing why are they there, not remembering who they are. Until, Thomas arrives and changes everything. The story basically starts there, and from there on you get to know how they live, find out about the maze, what happens at night, the mystery of why are they there, trying to find how to live and desipher the maze, etc.<br />I could not stop reading, wanting more story, more answers. When I finally finished reading, I went and bought the second book of the series, eager to know what happens next.<br />I strongly recommend this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is the best app that you can get if you  like temple run and despicable me. I like it because it is a stradage game and most kids need more.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Great satire and very entertaining. You don't need to be a Zombie fan to appreciate this book. A fun read.
B0049J3RBC|4.0|We loves this little picture. Entertaining for both kids and adults. The plot is unique and the concept refreshingly different.
0345529057|5.0|After watching Game of Thrones on HBO, I had to read the books. I am NOT disappointed. It's Great!!! I can't say which I like better.
0786939532|5.0|For everyone who enjoys reading books of the fantasy-genre, this series, particularly the first two trilogies are an absolute must-read. Despite the otherworldly setting, the intrigue and character development makes all the story seem very real..<br />And at times, just as brutal.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome for kids I mean who doesn't like minions run for bannas get the app Right now .
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I sent you guys an email to tell you that my in-game purchase to upgrade my virus has disappeared. So you got my $9.99 and the game doesn't show my purchase.  Wtf can I get a response? Or a refund? Or my virus upgrade? ? ANYTHING?  I used to love the game, so I wanted to do better, so I upgraded. A little courtesy and a<br />reply is owed to me please.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am addicted to the show.  Did a marathon with Season 3.  All I can say is...Come on Season 4!
B000065V3H|5.0|I grew up watching this movie. Patrick D is so lovable in this movie.  It brings me back to how high school really is: clicks, jocks nerds, and how we all just want to fit in.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The characters are so riveting in their episode by episode development.  Alan Cumming is amazing,  I can't wait to see him in &#34;Macbeth.&#34;  The good/evil delineation is very challenging.  It's a thinking person's series.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|I like this movie, great acting but the original will always be one of my faves. My daughter begged me to buy this for her and I'm glad I did. a good movie to watch with whole family.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a great way to pass time when the weather is not great for being outside. My daughter likes to touch the fish and see what happens.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I have this game on my phone and I just recently updated it. There are new clothes, new jetpacks, and a new vehicle. Hopefully halfbrick decides to update for Kindle Fire HD soon. Other than that, great game. I highly recommend it!!
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|Got it as free app of the day which is the only upside. Other than that the  game displays upside  down no matter what the orientation of my kindle hd. Will wait  for the next update before deleting it
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|One of the best PvP mot out there. Completely addicted. Can't get enough. If you like fun and action this is for you.
B007MU85D0|5.0|For me, an album usually has one or two tracks that I simply don't care for. Not so with My Head Is An Animal.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Can this game be be updated like I can do on my smart phone...........our is it not possible..please let me no.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Though her book is geared toward mothers, the themes are universally accessible. Fey's voice comes through flawlessly. A great experience.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have had the weather channel app on my phone and kindle fire for a couple of years now and loved it. It was fast, easy to get the weather for home, my mother's house, and places I traveled frequently. It was a clean easy to use app that I recommended and installed on my brother's and mother's kindles. Sadly, this is no more. The latest update has added a multitude of pictures and ads popping up all over the screen. They have added in video and maps, hid the list of locations, and put the weather in a small bubble off to one side. When I can get the weather to show up, it is hidden in and around pictures, ads, graphics and pop ups. And no the pictures are not of the place with the weather, they appear to be random and very annoying. It is now difficult to get the weather and even harder to read it. Until this last update, I would have given this app 5 stars. Now I recommend removing it and finding something else.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I can play this game whenever I need a little time filler or if I need to relax. Makes you concentrate and forget about the obvious.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great, connect the dots game. Lots of different levels from easy to difficult. I wish they would add additional levels. I have been through all of the ones available.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|This is just ok. Nothing more nothing less. Sorry wish I could say it was cool. But I can't. Bye
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have this on both my phone and kindle. I recommended it and installed it on my brother and mother's kindles as well. It is easy to use, easy to set the time and easy to snooze or shut off.
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|This is just ok. Nothing more nothing less. Sorry wish I could say it was cool. But I can't. Bye
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This does exactly what it supposed to. My only complaint is it's hard to see the text for iOS vs. Android inputs, but there's really not much room there.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|For the price, it was not what i was realy looking for. it only has one point where it stands up and it is hard to do any typing in that poisition, it is okay for reading.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|We love The Piano Guys, and this new disc is no exception; their interpretation of classic works, along with the innovative videos, makes this collection one that we will listen to for years to come!
0425252868|5.0|If you are a student of World War II aviation, or just looking for an outstanding history lesson, you must read this book.<br /><br />This well researched and tightly written tale challenges the definition of the word \\"victory\\".<br /><br />Author Adam Makos forces his reader to confront the wrenching reality that good and honorable men are sometimes found on opposite ends of the same gun.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|There's something about these classic stories that is still appealing, although we have not made the progress predicted, this story gives insight into the time it was written, the beginning of the space age.  I especially enjoyed Clarke's introduction, recounting the process of this novel's creation, collaborating with Stanley Kubrick to create a film (and book) that changed the way we viewed science fiction films; without it, it is unlikely that Lucas could have done what he did a decade later.
B008I43DYU|4.0|A very nice and simple to use calculator. Huge keyes make for an easy input. Also one screen for simple calculations and another for advanced is a user-friendly feature.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Watching this is like reading a great historical novel, like one written by Ken Follett, for example. Three more words required.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|Twists made this really enjoyable. Even the odd characters were real. Amazing what can eventuate when make decisions in extreme circumstances. Great absorbing read.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A government official is killed by two men, who quickly get into a car and drive away. Roadblocks go up looking for two men in a car. Not long afterward, Jack Reacher, who's hitchhiking nearby, is picked up by two men and a woman in a car, all of whom claim to be on their way to a business meeting of some sort. But there are a lot of odd things about this trio, and Reacher starts to wonder what's really going on. That's the setup for A Wanted Man, which continues the winning streak that Lee Child has been on (the decent enough The Affair excepted) since 61 Hours. A Wanted Man is much less action-driven than a lot of the other Reacher books (until the climax, that is), but what it lacks in brawls, it more than makes up for in puzzles, clues, and mysteries, which has always been what's set apart the Reacher books for me. Just who was the man murdered, and why are so many high-level government officials checking in? Who's the woman with the two men? And why - and how - are so many people involved with this case disappearing? All of these are really just the tip of a massively complicated iceberg, because just as those mysteries begin to unfold, a whole new batch of questions rise up in their place. A Wanted Man is a little more controlled than 61 Hours and Worth Dying For; the setup along prevents Reacher from being as proactive as he normally would be, and a lot of the book finds him struggling to stay caught up with everything that's in motion. All of that, though, only added to the appeal of this one for me. The mystery is rich and engaging, and there's not a reveal that didn't surprise me in one way or another (although I'll concede that the final revelation regarding what it's all about felt a little anticlimactic, but that's okay), and watching Reacher puzzle his way through it made for an engaging read that I couldn't put down once I started. If you like the Reacher books more for their action and physicality, you may not like this one as much; if you're in it for the plotting and the mysteries, you'll find a lot here to enjoy. (Special note: the Kindle version of this came with a short story called \\"Deep Down,\\" which details Reacher's efforts to find a mole within a Senate subcommittee meeting. It's short but satisfying, and makes for a nice bonus that would be worth buying on its own.)or the plotting and the mysteries, you'll find a lot here to enjoy.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|A different kind of read but I liked it.  So glad I got the book before seeing the movie or I probably never would have read it.  The movie was so loosely based and such a disappointment.
1451627297|5.0|I simply LOVED this book.  One of King's best.  Right up there with The Stand, and IT.  I read it in eBook format, and recomended it to EVERYONE.  This copy, I bought for on of my digitaly challenged friend.  He, btw, is loving it too.
142720599X|5.0|A friend recommended the Stephanie Plum Novels a few years ago. They are a great read and I really get a kick out of the characters.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a show!  Need to watch Season 3 so I will be caught up with the show.  Amazon makes it easy to pay and watch the shows.
B0093QE37S|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time and one of our favorites. You just can ask for more star power than Hepburn, Grant and Stewart. First class acting, great story, witty and entertaining dialogue -- all around fabulous movie. The quality of the HD for a movie this old is pretty impressive too. Even though my husband and I have seen this movie a million times, it's almost like watching a new movie when you see it in HD. You see and hear so many things you never noticed before.
B002TZ3C8G|4.0|It took me a long time to get into this book, but once I was hooked I couldn't put the book down. I found the john Corey character a bit grating at first. His smart arse humour was very grating, and at times a bit unbelievable, but once I got used to him, he grew on me.
B00AF6B2BK|5.0|awesome album and it's even a picture album!!! So cool.  It was a Father's Day present for my husband and he loved it
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus is a patriot, a true warrior, and a generally outstanding individual telling a personal story of triumph, trials, tragedy, hope, brotherhood and love
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|cute movie to watch. i was tired when watching it so i kind of fell asleep but the movie was very fun.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Really expected this to be a kiddy, nothing but eye candy, type of flick, but was pleasantly surprised. While there is some very good eye candy, it no where approaches gaudy, and all fits the story very well, which I must say is quite epic, with some fairly deep themes throughout. The two main reasons why I feel it did not do well at the box office, was the advertising style focusing only on the effects and bravado. That along with something the author could not have know when this was written, the fact that Mars is a beautiful, but barren world, information that is no engrained in our conciseness now, that the believability of this story occurring there is almost laughable. Wonder for the purposes of this movie, it was set in some different unknown world, if that would have helped. Either way, do yourself a favor, and check out this, extremely fun, and interesting movie.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game is tough I set like playing this game... I'm excited to get further... plus see what else you guys bring
B005PK57IK|5.0|I convicted of not having a more colorful title.  Anyway, well done.  Characters are expanded upon, even more flaws than they're willing to admit to themeelves.  Very well done .
B00499QUK2|5.0|This series is true to the spirit of the original characters, but modernized.  The acting is excellent and the stories are intriguing.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Very unique storyline. I would not have expected the ended but it was fabulous. Reminds me of Shallow Grave. Recommend.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Everyone has been talking about bugs with the newsfeed but mine is working fine, as is everything else. This app is awesome! Everyone should get it.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|my granddughter wnted this as she was staring in a production and used this as a reference.  It worked well and was useful  By the way she is a star.
B004I744AS|5.0|Easy to get what I am looking for rather it is defenition or spelling. Layout is even of statements make this a fun use.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|This album is a lot of fun. This band has a lot of different sounds and I enjoy them all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it so much it's AWESOME. I wish there there is going to be endermen I REALLY want them. But it's still AWESOME.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable me minion run is the most funniest and funniest game and app you will not regret getting.  Please get it cause you will have a blast playing it.
B005FFW46S|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I would recommend to anyone that is a Pratchett fan. Good plot, humor and<br />emotions. My favorite book is Thud, followed by Nightwatch.
0060989157|5.0|I loved reading this book because it shows that it really doesn't matter how much money you have or how famous you are, rock stars have the same problems that the every day Joe has:  Family issues, relationship issues, friend issues and some really sad hard times that not even Motley could escape.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I had to return this item because I accidentally ordered the blu-ray version. I was charged $35.00 for &#34;restocking&#34; fee. Outrageous!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm ready for the next book already!  In love with the story and the characters.  I have reread the books before each new one comes out.
B006H5120E|5.0|We have not watched this yet. I bought it on sale for my son. His birthday is not till October. But who dosent love the Titanic movie. I can t waith to watch in in 3D!!
B008JFUPFI|3.0|Do you ever feel like an outcast or an alien?  Superman (inner and outer) searches for the answers to:  How can I use my talents and strength?  What's my place in this world?  Who am I?  What do I follow?  In other words, this is more than a rescue fantasy for the young and old.  Before working for the newspaper, we see superman as a waiter and a truck driver.<br /><br />Zod saying that he was raised to be aggressive reminds me of a story I once heard  about a woman who experienced a lot of betrayal in her life.  One day upon hearing that she was pregnant decided to groom her child to grow up and take revenge on others so that the mother could vicariously take pleasure in his behaviour.  Decades later, in therapy, the daughter told her therapist that she felt like her mother's weapon and that she disliked people and wanted to heal.  Zod, in order to receive his mother's love, most likely had to accept his mother's wishes. I think a clue to this phenomenon occurs at the very beginning of the movie when superman, just after being born, was told by his parents, \\"Our hopes and dreams go with you.\\"  The intention and context is different but the idea is there that parents have wishes for their children.  What (un)conscious beliefs might a child pick up from their parents?  Could any of these beliefs be the \\"enemy\\" within that the heroic side of us is faced to wrestle with and heal?<br /><br />I think the lengthy adrenaline provoking special effects distract from the inspirational aspects of this tale.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|You can not go wrong with Stephen King books, and the price was right.  Very easy to download for the seller
B003WJ81MA|1.0|I can see where they were going with this film and I recognize that the costume and set design were very advanced for their time, but the acting and story in this movie were painful. I fell asleep a couple times and that has only happened to me once before.
1400049628|5.0|The more I kept thinking he couldn't possibly have more information or advice,<br />it just kept coming. This book is so detailed, and I learned so much. If you're<br />into zombies or just want to know how to protect yourself, you MUST read this.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|It was a slow start and hard to pull together until about mid-movie. The choice of villain was predictable. Acting was ok in this movie.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|By just playing a couple of minutes of this game.  I can tell you I already like it.  It reminds of the comedy of the game Conker's Bad Fur Day!  But plays like an rpg.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|If u get stuck, there r NO clues to help u find what u need. I uninstalled it! It was fun when the clues opened an gave u what u needed. But when there was no way to find out where to find an arrangement of colors...ur stuck!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app! I love it because it is so realistic I love it!!! It's so fun try it for yourself
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie was great. I highly recommend it. Not a big Helen Hunt fan but she does a great job in this movie.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Frankly it's a series that I would not have bothered to read but, the movie was well paced, well done, exciting and enjoyable. There was just enough character development to make me want more so I read the trilogy as well and thoroughly enjoyed the books as well. Woody Harrelson was a nice bonus...I'd watch that man reading a book!
B003XDZN8A|3.0|So, the shoe itself fits wonderfully, but the top strap does not. I stretched them out with vitamin bottles, lol, because they were very short straps. They fit, but were painfully tight until I did that. Crocs do not offer just a strap, so there is no way to buy one to make them fit more correctly from the manufacturer (and they no longer offer free strap replacement as they did only 3 years ago). The shoes themselves are cute and comfortable. The sole is thick and cushy. So much nicer looking than the clog, but with the same airy comfort.<br /><br />I've lowered my review after time, because until I removed the top straps, even with stretching, these started cutting my feet. Since that affects the aesthetics (they're still nice, but more like a ballet flat instead) as well as the likelihood of them staying on, I can't say I like them as much as I did. I don't have this kind of problem with any other shoes.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I love it, but it may be too graphic for some. If you like Sons of Anarchy you are gonna like this show.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Love this man's music! He's a drummer's drummer, and an excellent songwriter, too. Miss him a lot...., wish he was still recording.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|i really like this CD. I wasn't sure i would but i real;ly like the music. another fine job by JT.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie.  One of our family favorites.  Good cast of characters and very funny.  Highly recommend it for a family night movie.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I loved the way the story continued but hated the way it ended abruptly.  That is the only reason I only gave it 3 stars.  Other books I have read that will be continued at least leave you in a good place.  Sylvia Day is a great writer and I have enjoyed some of her other books but she needs to learn how to end them in a better way.  I will be anxious to get the next book so I can get the entire story and feel in a good place.
B00874T02K|5.0|This is an awesome app. I do a lot of running and soccer so I don't usually have time to do upper body workouts, but these are great! They don't take that long and build muscle quickly!
B000ICXQHE|5.0|Intelligent, entertaining film with plenty of twists. Inside Man is a quality throwback of the classic 1960's era crime movies.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|As a bonifide fanatic of the \\"BONES\\" series, I was curious to see how the \\"CASTLE\\" programs compared.  With summer here and no \\"bones\\" to watch and wearing out my Amazon purchased<br />DVDs, I decided to give this show a lookover.  Very impressed indeed!  Well produced with excellent photography of NY (where I live), fine acting, good plot lines (I like the romance situation with<br />Beckett & Castle) overall good casting and sets. and humor to boot.  Some of the stories appear to be inspired by some Bone episodes: the growing but slowly romantic connections, and the bickering<br />between a rich consultant and a tough cop like Booth and Dr Brennan.  That's ok because they are all well done, fun to watch and occasionally shed a tear or two: I am always the romantic!  CASTLE<br />is a bit more realistic while BONES is a bit more sci fi & fantasy.  Both series are excellent.  I also have the MENTALIST DVDs but have not yet watched any of them (all from AMAZON of course!).<br />Crime, love, action, humor & goo; who could ask for anything more!!  And I love New York!!  And very lovely women, too!  When I finish the 5th season I will have more to say; I have the 5th on a<br />ANAZON VIDEO LIBRARY file.
1936608898|5.0|This book goes over every detail of how different foods affect you and WHY they affect you this way. It is a great program and I think everyone should try it.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|I was a huge fan of the original movies and was a little upset that they were gonna remake this movie. I felt there was no way this movie could compare. The first two were true campy horror greatness. But to my surprise they did an amazing job and I can not wait to own this on DVD!
B005DJREGQ|3.0|I think the story drags a little, but is worth watching.  I wouldn't watch it a second time, however.  The first time is OK, so far.
B005544V6A|5.0|Didn't watch it the first time but really enjoyed watching it on Prime.  Good plots and interesting characters and the ladies make me want to go back to work! (not really)
0525478817|5.0|Arrived new, very nice appearance . I Purchased for my daughter and she enjoyed it. I recommend this book for teens.
B000TKZ3TO|2.0|The 300+ minute count is due to them counted both the Theatrical and &#34;Extended&#34; versions. There's another one out there with the  3+ hours Extended Verion, wait until you can find that one. This extended version is not the one you're looking for. The additional footage is not seamed into the movie, its on the extras. Most of the added minutes comes from the alternate intro sequence. For true fans who are looking for that long extended version that was shown on HBO, THIS IS NOT IT!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Having a camera program on the kindle fire, with it's one camera makes it impossible to take decent photographs, so what is the point with a forward looking camera?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great way to get your mind off of things and have some fun! some of the games are very challenging. THIS GAME IS ADDICTING! !
B0067RQYNW|2.0|I can't use the kindle keyboard with any efficiency and accuracy, which, for me,  means I cannot create original documents in the kindle fire. Also, it is not apparent what the command structure might be, Is it hidden?

B0064X7FVE|3.0|While it will provide local weather, including a 10 day forcast, it is not easy to switch to other geographical areas.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app for many reasons. 1) There are a variety of versions of the bible to choose from. 2) Its easy to travel with. 3) I like the features. 4) I like the verse of the day. The only thing that I would say that I have a problem with is that not all bible versions are downloadable. I would suggest this app.

B009MYARIK|2.0|I've read some other Kinsella books that I thought were funny, but this one was just too outrageous. Maybe she's run out of ideas.
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|This is one of Jane Austen's quieter novels and yet it is very compelling. It starts off slow but just tends to drag you in. I recommend this to any Austen fan.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|AMAZING!!! if you love amy winehouse as much as i do it is a definite MUST have in your collection!! R.I.P AMY
B001OGWY1W|5.0|This movie shows the moral dilemmas of life quite well as no good deed goes unpunished...but why? Is it due to our weaknesses and the projection and lashing out that goes with it? Perhaps that truly is the case. This movie shows that all heroes at every level of life pay a price for all of us which perhaps is what really and truly makes them a hero in the first place. As I watched it again I couldn't help but think what a huge loss Heath Ledger is to actors and those that appreciate a truly good performance. Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine are of course superb but we knew they would be from their performances in Batman Begins. Ledger was a delight and a surprise. He made you feel the fear his victims felt. To call him compelling would be an understatement.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The room is a great game.it has a good storyline,it was interesting and one part I really liked was that you can save because most puzzle games you have to either play it or restart
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It has been a very long time since I have been so moved by a book. What seems a collection of short stories is truly a weaving of lives loved and lost. The final chapters conclude w/ a life well lived- all of them. Mr. Hosseini's gentle prose is so insightful that it has made me self reflect in situations AND be more generous in my judgment of others. What a gift this author has bestowed upon us....
B008KRJWEK|5.0|its awesome and fun for me becouse it is challenging for me . I love it so much I did not want to delete it my mom made me.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I don't know who's bright idea this new update was but it's terrible. I uninstalled it. They shouldn't' t have tried to fix something that wasn't broken. I loved the old app bring it back and I'm sure lots of people will reinstall it.
B0086700CM|1.0|It is to difficult to play and instructions and options are not clear. I have deleted it from my Kindel Fire
B001AVCFJM|4.0|The movie was outstanding, a very well-done reboot of the franchise. The extras: a gag reel and a &#34;behind the scenes&#34; featurette were a bit skimpy. So I give the movie five stars and the DVD extras only two stars.
B005HSL626|3.0|This game has good graphics and is fun to play but it is not my first choice of games to play.
B002PA1HHI|4.0|It's interesting and intriguing and a good critique of the materialism and egotism in our society. The movie is thought-provoking, funny, and disturbing all at one. Christian Bale gives a great performance.
B007MDB71O|5.0|John Carter is an excellent movie that was not given the credit it deserved.  Excellent story line and excellent graphics and scenery.  Gave an almost exact view of what Mars looks like.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I love Tina Fey. I loved her before reading her book, and now I love her infinitely more. Can we please be friends? I am very sad my time with her is coming to an end. I recommended this book to anyone looking for a lighthearted read, with sage advice, and sassy humor.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Perhaps it's not my cup of tea but I cannot point out anything about this movie that I liked.  Perhaps it was the fact that it was a musical and I was being a good sport watching it with a friend who likes that kind of stuff or the fact that the movie dragged and the storyline was hard to follow.  I wouldn't even give this movie a star.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great show. Fairly good weapons handling and squad tactics. Fairly realistic portrayal of what refugee, resistance existence might be like. Good deep character development, and evolving plots.Suitable level of gross, yuck and splatter in wasting aliens. Interesting exploration of social, moral, philosophical and religious topics.<br />Did I mention weapons and splatter oh and Explosions ?
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|This is a Great Toddler Movie! Wish it was longer, But its still a good 45 min long! cant wait for another
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I never hear them before and  that s only one album I bought..I really like  this more I listen more I like  it has a very thick electronic sound  very dramatic and in some parts even apocaliptic,
B003VANOFY|1.0|At first, I liked this headset. After using it for about 5 months or so, I hate it. The battery life slowly degraded over time. I used to have around an 8 hour battery life but now I only get around 1 hour.<br /><br />The software is absolutely terrible. The audio gets distorted many time while I am playing games. Usually it cuts out randomly but sometimes it just gets distorted.<br /><br />The one thing that is good about this headset is that it is comfortable.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product to anyone.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book treated both sides with respect and dignity. Those of us who have been to war often notice that war books and movies focus only on the gung ho and see us as robots. We're human and this book really captured the sorts of thoughts we really have
1400079144|5.0|It's Dan Brown what more can you say!  I've read everyone of his books and can't wait for his next one.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|I thought this was rather soppy. Neither of the main characters really grabbed me and i didn't sympathize with them.
B000SEIDR0|4.0|I found this book to be really engaging and thought-provoking.  While I am still a dedicated omnivore, I do find myself more often considering what I'm eating, and thinking hard about the choices that I make.  The depictions of non-organic factory farming and its effect on the land - not to mention the nutritional content of the resulting food - are hard to ignore, even if one considers the fact that Pollan has a particular point of view.  Makes me want to run to the nearest farmer's market and support local agriculture!
B007B5EDEG|5.0|This great narrative is totally absorbing even though I have already seen 30 episodes of Game of Thrones, which sticks very closely to the original text. It is a terrific read.
B004AM5QT4|5.0|This book is not quite a page turner yet still quite a compelling and satisfying read. The characters are well-drawn and believable as is most of the plot (and the politics and science behind the plot). Although the story is just a bit dated, and there were a few typos in the Kindle version that I read (made me happy to see, as an Indie author and publisher who is tired of the beat-downs Indie authors get for imperfectly edited books--as legacy publishers also obviously have typos): \\"Jump in the ear.\\" That typo was hilarious (it occurred in a flashback to childhood, for the main character Dr. Jeannie Ferrami). I liked the science, the strong male characters, the political and academic settings and situations. The females in peril scenarios were very realistically written. In certain moments there was an emotional quality lacking (in the experience of the female character's particularly. Not every male writer can capture what it's like to be a woman) yet the plot elements involving women were inherently fascinating, whether they occurred in lab/science scene, a detective/rape aftermath scene, or during an actual violent/sexual scene between main characters. Not sure why so many people hated or felt disappointed by this book. Yes, it did seem somewhat uneven yet the dialogue, characters, plot, scenes/setting and much of the prose felt right-on--it was a generally good read. If you like political thrillers and science gone awry/abused for greed, as well as strong female characters, then I think you would enjoy this book. It was a good enough read that I kept wanting to get back to it (even after using up my allotted reading time for the day :D). Happy reading~*
0425166805|5.0|It is a must read book. Mr Daniken had it right from the 70s they do not think he is crazy anymore.
B00005ND42|5.0|As an aid to studying the Beethoven Sonatas for Violin and Piano I have listened to YouTube performances by many recent and older artists.  Ibragimova and Tiberghien phrase so beautifully to make the dynamic contrasts so musical. Kremer/Argerich and Zukerman/Barenboim both are as good as one could want. One major artist whose version I do not like at all is Anne-Sophie Mutter, with Lambert Orkis. In the end, though, none of these performances satisfies the way Oistakh and Oborin do. One might expect stereotypically exaggerated Romanticism from this generation of Russians, but Oistrakh knew exactly what the music demanded, with Oborin a co-equal always. These sonatas demand mastery of such a wide range of style and feeling that even accomplished musicians don't always succeed. This recording is as close to a definitive effort as I can imagine.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|This app is very amusing even though you can't really make any pictures with it unless you're really talented.  I love this app it's fun to doodle with :)
B004G0SJU8|5.0|Two great stars, great acting, romance.  Fascinating  plot:  what do angels do on earth and what happens when an angel falls in love with a human?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game you can make things you discover new things about ice age you can even have friend's
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Whatever were they thinking? Although the chemistry between these two wonderful actors is plain, the writing was awful and disjointed.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Riordan used his skill as an author to make me feel a bond to the characters. I was amazed by this book.
B003RV43X4|3.0|I'll stick with the old version - campy but entertaining. Ralph Fiennes goes over the top as Hades/Voldermort - the kid's liked it
B00CAUH7UE|3.0|Good book, but too long for the concept it espouses. An interesting read, but I abandoned it about three quarters of the way through, because it had become repetitive.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have enjoyed this &#34;series&#34; since its inception. It's a great contrast between the classes, and the machinations of the various characters at all levels is fun to watch. The show depicts quite well our all-too-common foibles of self-interest, entitlement, envy, and downright stupidity at times. Some of the actors are quite perfect for their roles, and the balance of the show between upstairs and downstairs drama is well-done. The demise of Sybil shortly into the season and Matthew at Season 3's end was sad but came as no great surprise. No one gets to be too happy for too long in this drama. I look forward to Season 4 and how Mary, who doesn't seem to have much luck with men (they die on her, almost quite literally in one case), responds to the latest tragedy.
B00BMHFYVA|5.0|Miles Kane once again releases an amazing album. Unlike the tranquil Colour of the Trap, Miles comes out rocking in this one. I feel in love with this album after the first listen, and haven't stopped listening since. A must buy!
B000FA5SMK|2.0|John Corey, the title character, is not very likeable. The story is more violent than it needs to be in order to get the point across..
B008KL2ITW|5.0|Freakin loved this book. I finished the book after 8 hours of non-stop reading. It's amazing. Thank you soooo much Jame McGuire, I really enjoyed reading this.
B003L77G6A|5.0|My boss just discovered this series and has been borrowing mine dvds.  He just left for Kuwait, so I bought him is own set to take with him!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm not much much of a reviewer, I just wanted to say that this book is awesome and deserves five stars.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Les Miserables seems unsure if it's a musical or movie. I'm perfectly fine with musicals in the film medium. [[ASIN:B001NKI60W Mamma Mia! The Movie]] was a great movie with quality singing, a well-paced story, and A-list actors who really delivered. However, even though I love Victor Hugo's novel and the Broadway musical, this film adaptation didn't work for me.<br /><br />The movie seems like it's a bunch of scenes strung together with Les Miserable music. I didn't get the sense that I was watching a movie with a coherent story. There are a lot of quick cuts from scene to scene that break up the storytelling a bit too much. Where in most musicals the camera tends to stay on a single scene or character, here it jumps around, breaking up the music.<br /><br />Another problem is the acting. With Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, and Anne Hathaway, this is an A-list cast. In fact, the producers seemed to go out of their way to get big names for this movie, even when they didn't fit. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver an A-list performance. I never saw Valjean, Javert, or Fantine. Rather, I saw Crowe, Jackman, and Hathaway. They never really became their characters. That's one of the dangers of hiring celebrity actors for stories like Les Miserable with well established characters.<br /><br />Another problem is the singing. For a musical movie to work, the singing has to be good. If the movie had wanted to just tell the story in Victor Hugo's novel, it should have done so. But the director made a musical, which means the music is an important part. And again I think the A-list cast hurt the movie. I love the Les Miserable soundtrack, but I could never imagine listening to this movie's soundtrack. The actors mix emotional acting (e.g., loud sobbing) with the songs, which again suggests that it's not clear whether this movie wants to be a musical or traditional movie. I don't know if the movie should have avoided celebrity actors because Mamma Mia did it right, but maybe in this case that would have worked better.<br /><br />There is much to like about the movie. The sets and costumes are absolutely convincing. It looks like its set in early 19th century France. There are some nice creative choices, such as having the chain-gang at the beginning pull in a ship and dropping the French flag. So visually there's a lot that works. It just doesn't work for me as a musical movie.<br /><br />The movie also gets a LOT better after it reaches the 1832 part of the story. The revolutionary movement is portrayed really well. Great rendition of \\"Do You Hear the People...\\"  Really stirring. But again there are some uneven choices, with the musical portion and then a brief fight scene without any music. There's still a lot of \\"speaking-singing\\" rather than pure singing.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give this 3.25 stars. It's certainly not horrible and most fans of Les Miserable will at least enjoy it, even if they won't love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game for any age. will keep you entertained for hours. great graphics and only problem is that you run out of energy to fast.
0062255657|3.0|Not in my lifetime did i ever expect to dislike one of Gaiman's novels... especially one I had been waiting for quite a while to read.  &#34;The Ocean...&#34; is not in any way a bad novel -- it's just &#34;Gaiman Light&#34; -- One of my fellow reviewers on Goodreads put it quite well.<br /><br />It's as if Neil were getting lazy... and I hate that, particularly from one of my all-time favorite authors
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|not valiant just a bunch of bad words and some bad graphics meaning a little blood and on one mission you play as a Taurus.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|i think it is a very good game heck i think every angrybirds game is great the blue bird  is awesome
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game, it's VERY challenging and you will need a pen and paper on some parts.  Need more levels.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its a great app but when ever you get a new friend on my kindle it does not save at all
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|If you are a true Eagles fan, then this is a must have item.  Just wonderful video footage, film footage, and members of the band on camera and telling their tales!  Everything you could want.  I love it!
B0043JDUNS|5.0|After watching Iron Man and Iron Man 2 back to back, we can't wait for Iron Man 3 in the theaters.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|this is great. I am reading the books and it is great to put faces to the characters. great writing.
B001KZG99A|5.0|This movie has just the right mix of action/Adventure and comic relief to make it fun for everyone. My husband and I loved it!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Sonic is one of my old time favorites. This is like playing the original game.<br /><br />I like these type of games. Some levels can be challenging but they are all levels you can eventually solve. There are enough levels so you can't memorize the order of tiles.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We watch 3 or 4 episodes a night and are only disappointed when we've seen all of a season's shows.  We love this series and can't wait for more.  Everything about it is extremely well done.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My baby loves it!  He is almost 5 months and is growing fast.  I wanted to get something that would entertain him while I cleaned the house because he cries every time I leave the room.this is the perfect distraction plus it helps him learn to balance and jump.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Great read, took only two days to finish. I would recommend the book to anyone who can read, tits McGee
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I loved this movie.  I have always been into science fiction and the Marvel world.<br /><br />I have two things to say about the Amazon Prime service:<br />1.  I played the movie full screen, on my 24 inch computer monitor, and it was not a clear and 'crisp' as I remember it in the movie theater.  I also use a subscription to Netflix and it seemed to be clearer there.<br /><br />2.  The movie had a lot of buffering during the playing.  I had, at a minimum, 6 experiences of buffering.
B000GOZ0ZK|5.0|Very clear, no hitches/hanging<br />It's scary, though I've watched it a few times before, but still very interesting<br />Recommended for those who appreciate scary adventures in movies
B009NQZVKG|2.0|I am a rabid fan of Collins and was disappointed by this book. I had expected much more and less scientific facts.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great app to get rid of the day, so you can sleep peacefully.<br />Would recommend you try this before taking meds.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Didn't know what to expect as this was my first foray into Robin Sloan. Some of the characters tried a little too hard to be quirky, but they were fun and endearing, and the story was truly unique. I love the integration of singularity theory into the novel, as well as the exploration of the function and effect of technology on our everyday experience, and the effect of technology on the sacred. Definitely worth the read.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book really resonated with me.  Four simple strategies to align my thinking and behavior, it actually made me feel better as I was reading it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love this show.  Plot and characters keep you glued to the series.  I love it and can't wait for Season 3!!!
3836503050|5.0|It's a great book with a good amount of pages and beautiful artworks! It's a great book to have for artists and alike. And with a price like that, who would say otherwise?
B003LL3LHO|4.0|To start off with, it is really awesome to read a book about Guild Wars, even if we as players aren't totally familiar with the characters (we do have the storyline, though). I think that the book lacked some simple characterization and description. How do the characters look? How do the buildings look? That sort of thing. I almost choked up at a couple points, but there just wasn't enough of a person to miss.<br /><br />But all in all, I'm a GW fanatic, and it did provide some cool backstories to events we know to have happened based on the lore. Worth a read that's fun, but don't expect anything really descriptive.
1595825045|5.0|If you're a fan of the Last Airbender series (like me), then this book is a great buy. It has lot of nice, big pages full of beautiful artworks. Just get it. You know you want it :)
B008LXZFH6|3.0|I heard a lot about Anchorman, and I finally took time watching it. As a whole, it was a huge disapointment. Maybe I had my expectations very high, due to other Will Ferrell movies that I really enjoyed, I don't know.<br /><br />Anyway, I gotta say it was a little bit funny, but not more than this.
3836532441|5.0|This is a huge book full of amazing art! For artists and all alike, this is a steal! The price is amazing and it's so worth it!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game its so addictive and fun.  I haven't had any problems with it yet. its amazingly awesome. fabulous.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Extremely long.  Had a problem very early on with the morality (and believe me I'm not a religious person, but I do think I am mostly a moral one) of Jacob's father, which continued throughout.  I finished it but with serious questions in my mind.  Perhaps that was the intent.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|The beginning was very difficult to read because of what was happening in the characters' lives.  I almost stopped reading, but I'm so glad I didn't.  The author wove a beautiful story.
193700788X|1.0|I flew through the first half of the series, eagerly awaiting the next novel year after year.... That is until the last few books where the storylines got repetitive, drawn out, and spookiest character REALLY began to grate on my nerves. I thought to myself, &#34;well this is the finale! It's got to bring the story to an end with some care, right?&#34; WRONG. I don't want to spoil anything for those of you who want to give the series' conclusion a chance, but all I have to say in the end is this: shame on you, publishers, for not holding MS Harris accountable for finishing up this series with grace and humor and page turning thrills. You're equally accountable as she is for this mess and disappointment of a finale. These characters deserved a better goodbye party than this. ugh.... I'm so bummed out!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|all your people go away and your stuff and I got a mystery box and it didn't<br />get it and it is stupid.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Got all of the dvds on blu-ray. All packaged in one nice container.<br />Not a lot of behind the scenes stuff but there are some things for each movie.<br />I got a great deal on this!!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|a real fun and timing consuming game. it actually took me a couple of days to beat this game. but in all actuallity a fun game
B00CF34B2I|2.0|This sounded exciting. After several hours trying to load it on a kindle fire and my Android phone, I realized that a 1.2 GB app was:<br /><br />a. Too big for the kindle fire.<br />b. Too heavy on processor for my phone<br /><br />I am surprised that I didn't see anyone else mention this in the reviews.
1477419497|4.0|Murder on the Cote d'Azur (The Maggie Newberry Mystery Series) by Susan Kiernan-Lewis is a charming cozy mystery, delivering a funny, attractive heroine and a healthy dose of romance. Set in France and America, the book is the first in the series and is an enjoyable summer read. There are occasional, minor issues with scene changes that may seem abrupt to some readers, but this does not provide a major distraction from the story.<br /><br />The characters are well drawn and intriguing. Kiernan-Lewis had me rooting for Maggie from the first page and hoping that she would solve the mystery. The plot had enough twists to keep me turning pages without giving me storylash. (You know, that pain you get in your brain when you fall into a plot hole?) Some cozy mysteries tend to make logic faux pas in an effort to avoid telegraphing the perpetrator too early, but Kiernan-Lewis avoids this pitfall, neatly dropping clues without bludgeoning her reader with an early reveal.<br /><br />Two additional elements which spice up this tasty literary treat are the French cuisine and Maggie's Very French Love Interest. I've never seen food used to deepen characterization in quite this way, but for Kiernan-Lewis, it works. I would have liked to get to know Laurent a bit better, but hey, hopefully he will show up in future installments.  I certainly hope so for Maggie's sake.<br /><br />This summer, get a little taste of France with a side dish of murder. I certainly enjoyed mine.<br /><br />For more reviews and other fun stuff, visit The Brass Rag at thebrassragcnr.wordpress.com
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Played this on pc first and had to be able to take it on the road. Lots of fun even when levels start to repeat. Then you just have to challenge yourself to go faster. I'm trying to see how much money I can accumulate before the game tells me I can't earn any more.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|The first really good movie of 2013.  Good characters, very good writing, a plot that's a little hard to follow, so you might rewind a few times to get everything.  Enough twists and turns to keep you involved throughout.  Nice to see Jude Law involved in top shelf movie after the duds he's been in the last few years.  Even the much maligned Channing Tatum deserves some love for his performance.
B005544TRQ|4.0|It's not your typical lawyer show, in that one is a fraud, but a good one at that. Its more about the characters than it is the cases.
B00B7FYJ9U|4.0|On the whole an excellent portrayal of the Frank Miller graphic novel.  Peter Weller as a 60 year old Bruce Wayne/Batman was spot on casting.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|The characters the actors play in this movie were all stellar. It had a decent amount of action, but would be a bit dry at times if not for the interesting characters. Its one of the few action/drama movies I would watch several times over.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Bruce Willis is more annoying than clever or funny.  Another Hollywood movie with great action scenes and very little plot or dialogue.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|This movie was a cash grab based off of the success of most of the others in the series. It was okay, but not worth spending any money on.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Watch out, you'll start thinking your name is Tony Stark. Graphics so amazing, virtualization almost becomes reality. Marvelous job Gameloft.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Excellent Literature, I couldn't put it down.  Put our lives in persepective with those who suffer.  Made me sad when the book was finished.
0345529057|5.0|This four volume set &#34;Song of Fire and Ice&#34; was purchased for my daughter, who up until recently, I never thought I would convince her to read for pleasure - I have been reading since I was 4 1/2 y/o and love my books...<br />I was thrilled at the quality and the price was right. Yes, I will be ordering again...
B004KPLVYA|5.0|the product was very good and the movie was great. I recommend it for all ages. very inspirational and moving
B005LTDPFW|5.0|I never liked Jazz as a child but slowly my wife and I have been drawn in with some songs we have heard here and there.  Strangely be both love Nina Simone so much the first songs we played for our new baby were hers.  We did not say anything to each other before hand, be just played two songs.  \\"Feeling Good\\" for me because I want want him to have confidence and my wife played him \\"Sinner Man\\" because she wants him to be crafty I think.  Anyway, after listening to and reading about Jazz, Soul and Nina I have learned that Jazz gave birth to most of what we listen to now and much of it is amazing.  That being said you would be a fool not to have some of Nina's work in your library.  Seriously.  You would have to be crazy.  She is like so Amazing that not having some of her music would be like horrible.  I don't want to even think about it.<br /><br />Birds flying high, you know what I mean.
B0021L8V1Q|2.0|ok movie, not great .I would not recommend it..The product was received in good shape. the movie was very corny. Not near as good as Iron man 1. In fact it was bad.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Good feel good movie...actually the bad guy was the good guy. Makes you want to be like him I'd recommend it for all ages
B004JMSIRC|4.0|the first delivery was defective and i had to return it.that is a hassle. tje second disc was received in good shape. I enjoyed the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is AWESOME!! It's like Temple Run,  but with a despicable twist. It entertains my brother and I for hours!! 5 out of 5
B000VEA38E|5.0|Excellent for any Star Wars fan. We already had the music, but his is a great addition. Our son loves listening to it in the car.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|A good disc with which to chillax after a crazy day...or as quiet accompaniment to my yoga practice to keep me centered and focused on my body and breath.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This type of game is right up my alley!! Challenging,but still able to solve it. Now I just need more levels...
B0090KZDSK|1.0|To say that I was excited to read this book was an understatement, I wanted desperately for it to have more substance than candy floss, unfortunately that is all I got. Even though I new there were 2 extra books planned, I still bought the stupid book. Almost every character seemed to devolve and with constant repetition it soon became my tranquiliser.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This wasn't exactly what I expected when I purchased it, but turned out to be a very nice read.  History mixed in with motivation and very easy to read.
0439023513|5.0|This is definitely a must read series. It's gripping and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Must read!
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|no words--pure joy in the beat, phrasing and timing of this new near legend--she takes my breath away and makes me dance with purity in the sound itself--old songs so so new--thank you mlle salvant, thank you.
1609611543|5.0|BOOK WAS ON TIME AND IN GREAT SHAPE.VERY INFORMATIVE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND.AMAZING, CUT DOWN ON MY BREADS,PASTA AND SOME CARBS AND LOST 20 POUNDS IN A MONTH AND A HALF.DID NOT CHANGE HOW MUCH I ATE AND STILL DRANK BEER AND ALCOHOL.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|This game was a little difficult for me and my goddaughter quickly lost interest.  I think it has too many steps and you must work quickly.
B000FC146C|5.0|I read this book more than 30 years, as well as seeing the movie more than once. It is just as great a read now as it ever was. I highly recommend this book---and the movie as well!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|A good small knife sharpener but packs a storage pouch, preferably one that could attach it to a belt or cord
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This season just didn't have the allure of the previous seasons.  A few slightly irritating plot twists combined with *SPOILER* the killing off of 2 of my favorite characters just didn't float my boat.  Other than that it was Downton Abbey - possibly the greatest filmed, written, and acted, soap opera of all time.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I purchased Clockwork Angels prior to attending the Rush concert in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I listened to it a few times but completely missed how very good the songs are. Now, after seeing Rush in concert and hearing Clockwork Angles songs live, I have been listening to the entire release on my iPod. I experimented with the equalizer settings and can now hear the instruments and singing with less of a muffled sound. The songs flow well from one to the next, and the music rocks! The drums are awesome, of course, and the guitar and bass are impressive too. Geddy Lee's voice does sound a little different than it used to, but it complements the music and I have grown to truly like it. Definitely buy Clockwork Angles! After you find the equalizer settings you prefer, you are bound to want to listen again and again!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted, can't wait for next season.  My husband and I stay up as late as we can watching another episode.
B009C7JS14|4.0|There is plenty of local weather info wherever you are in the world.  It seems that you can only get weather forecast for where you areand not for the places you are planning to visit
159463176X|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this book.  Better than Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns (hard to beat).  Loved, loved it!  Have not met anyone who did not love it as well.  Thank you Mr Hosseini.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Very fun visual effects are good. Grand kids also like it .coould have lower prices for buying goodies and the bad witch and glass girl could be on this and the flying monkey.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|A little long but a good movie was great in blu-ray as the picture was very sharp.A good price for the movie.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|Blackberry Smoke has shown me a creative talent that is second to none. Every one of their releases has been brilliant and Whippoorwill does not disappoint. This album has more of a &#34;blues&#34; edge to me than their previous music, but that is probably not a real stretch for them considering everything they have already done. Plus that is probably an &#34;exploration&#34; combined with some of their influences coming to the surface.<br /> If you like their previous releases, this one is definitely worth a listen.

B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love it!  Keeps me occupied when waiting at doctors office and such.  As easy or easier than playing game on the laptop.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway sufers is a fun game and when I got the Paris update I liked it even more cause you could use a key and start over from where you were
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Maybe I just haven't mastered the Kindle yet, but I have trouble getting where I want to go on FB when I access through the Kindle.  Seems I am constantly having to close out the program and try again.  Once I get where I want to be, it works well.
B008POAQS4|2.0|The actor who plays Louis Litt is just awful.  He's a lousy actor, and he's truly unattractive.  No tv show would have a female principal character who is this ugly and one dimensional.  Why do viewers have to endure such lousy casting and acting when the character is male?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|As you get to the higher levels it is very challenging.  That is what makes it fun!  You are always thinking about how to make that move without crossing over any of the &#34;pipes&#34;.  Addicting, fun!
B004NS710C|5.0|This is a great movie. Lots of non-stop action. Has a great story line and Denzel Washington. How much better can it get!!!!!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Great movie. Lousy streaming. Had to restart many times. Frustrating. It was like watching YouTube. It affected my enjoyment of movie.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I love this game...very fun great graphics!  I was. up all night playing it. there are a lot of ads which is the reason I didn't give it a 5.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Excellent story and a great cast. An exquisite nostalgic friendship tale, not only for opera lovers. Very enjoyable. Almost Five Stars
B005HED11Y|5.0|This pioneer series was way ahead of it's special effects for tv science fiction time. The stories were very good and interesting. The characters were believable and engrossing. I'm not a science fiction junkie but I always made an exception when it came to this show for regular viewing. Every episode can be enjoyed again and again which is the mark of excellence.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I love the whole idea of the book. Fresh, innovative and funny...It felt like I was watching a movie instead of reading a book. Will definitely read more from this author. I think she did a brilliantly fantastic job.
0316247545|5.0|Maybe, the book you must have if you're a brony and wanna be the perfect brony, please, buy it !
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Too many smut scenes in the other two... but I enjoyed this last book. Good job I recommend reading it
B009XIXVU6|4.0|He molds knowledge and emotion so poetically with just a few words!<br /><br />The depth of the simple joys of our relationships are placed under a microscope by the huge events of history.
B006O6F4O6|5.0|My son really enjoy's this toy.  It so far has held up quality wise with a 5 year old.  It's a creative deisgn and over fun to play with.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am having so much fun with my kids playing this game. The minions are so cute! We enjoy watching each other play as well as competing for the highest score. But beware, it is very addictive!
B006O6FK2W|5.0|Holding up well with a 5 year old.  Soft foam Batman can be eaten though if smaller sibblings are around though.  Beware.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|quite a brain teaser , you still think about options even when not playing, please hurry up and put more levels on
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I have been trying for a week now to install this game on the first edition Kindle Fire. All it does is freeze my tablet and is constantly in my DL bar at 0%. I love the magic games on my X Box for the last 3 years and was super stoked when I found out it was finally on the Kindle. But to no avail. I really hope they fix this issue soon. If so I will write a real review.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Visuals were great, but the storyline was all over the place... I wanted to like the movie, but it was just too confusing.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love this app.  Just like the in FB.  It does sync with the FB version so I just take up from where I last left off.  must get if a fan of Bubble Witch
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I really enjoy this movie.  It's funny, interesting and full of action.  No matter how many times I watch it I still hate for it to end.  They need to make &#34;Django II!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I loved all of the songs on the album, not a bad one on there. Could relate to some of the songs
B00AB7IA1S|5.0|This game is awesome and the google play store rates this game five stars with eighteen reviews. No bad permissions.  No in app purchasing. And the game really normally costs 99 cents.  You can't go wrong.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|But it's gotten a little off kilter here. At this point, we already know McLane always wins, therefore no suspense.
B003WUYP56|4.0|Very interesting, thoughtful and provocative.  One probably needs to have studied physics to fully grasp the depth of Smolin's arguments.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief took me by surprise. Very imaginative structure. It is a captivating story that never lets you down. Full of heartbreak but also many instances of courage and heroism. This book`s story is one that will live in me forever.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|You just can't miss with Clancy!<br />Another superb story; all the suspense and action you could ask for!!<br />The whole story is exactly what's going on in the real world, much like Executive Orders.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Spoilers ahead!!!<br /><br />This is book definitely went a different route by the end of the book.  It kind of just ended, there was no cliffhanger, no drama, no will they won't they.  It was just here are the problems Gideon and Eva face and eventually they will get solved.  It just kind of ended in the middle of the story.  And that's fine with me, it's just different from the other books where there was more a summary or closing of that story arc.  Their relationship is definitely on more solid ground by the end of the book, they do take a big leap together in the middle that solidifys them even more.  Which means a lot less Eva whining, she is more secure in her love for Gideon and visa versa. The great sex scenes are still there, the craving is definitely still there.  The relationship is more open and honest this time around, but still amazingly frustrating at the same time.  Since there will be more books and you definitely get attached to these characters emotionally I would love for them to have a healthier relationship by the end of this series.  Gideon is still domineering and pushing Eva to quit her job and work for him, I have no doubt that will happen or she will break away with her boss and start a firm of their own at a certain point.<br /><br />This book also becomes a little bit of a mystery at a certain point.  Who knows about Gideon's murder, and how is the Russian Mafia involved in all of this, so the series has taken on a different light and that's fine because its adds a dimension to the story that will keep readers in suspense.  I know there are people out there that doubt that Gideon actually committed the murder, but I think its pretty obvious by the end of this book he did.<br /><br />Can't wait for book #4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|I thought the concept was different and interesting. This movie takes a good look at the human spirit and how we treat one another. I really enjoyed it.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This has been a heavy favorite movie for myself and my group of friends since the time it came out.we still quote from it all these years later.its so well done and even funny at moments . great casting as well
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Im watching the second part as i write this.<br /><br />Gasland is a great movie we do need to start caring about this world so our children will actually have something. We need to stop seeking fossil fuels as well as natural gas.<br /><br />We need to look at alternative safer energy sources. Wind, water, Geothermal energy which is natural energy in the earth that could power the earth longer than we could imagine.
B002BJGYUS|5.0|My grand daughter has loved this story for years and I scored real hit with this gift. She has spent a whole weekend watching it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Don't like exploring the same rooms repeatedly. The popular for other games in the middle of searching and constant nagging to rate the game are annoying. Doubt I'll keep the game long enough to finish it.
B007IK44CK|5.0|I had low expectations going into this movie. Not generally being an action movie fan, and not being a huge fan of the previous films.Ghost Protocol has great action, decent characters and is fun to watch.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|It was sad but happy, and a little unbelievable. I wonder how close they followed the true story. Enjoyed it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This series was addicting, and I lost a lot of sleep watching as many episodes as possible in a day and still live the day.  I am now waiting for season 5 with much anticipation.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game really puts your problem solving skills to work. I love it and cant until more rooms are added.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I'm liking this offering better than his first book of the trilogy.  &#34;Winter&#34; has so much history and drama  in novel form, it just sweeps you through WWII.  Wish it wouldn't end.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This show is magnificent. From start to finish you are learning more about the characters and the story being told from the beginning.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|The author uses research to support her thoughts.  This book gave me some new insight into myself.  I have spent my life thinking something is just wrong with me. I'd rather have a root cannel than go to a party.  I now know I am just the way I'm  suppose to be and I have lots to contribute.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love game. It is so addicting. Plus i love the minions and despicable me. Baaaa-naaaaa-naaa bananas!!! This game is really fun.
B007M45PMU|4.0|As with any music purchase, you buy it cause you know a few songs that are on the album... so some of the other songs were not very entertaining.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game makes you think and it isn't boring or frustrating. There are so many different boards and ways to play.
B0038BBA4I|4.0|As with any music purchase, you buy it cause you know a few songs that are on the album... so some of the other songs were not very entertaining.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I wasn't sure that Kindle for Android was going to do what I wanted - to easily spend time in between appointments studying poetry. I thought the font size would be too small and I would go blind trying to read it. I thought that there would probably be some complicated software system I would have to learn. In short I was pretty nervous when I downloaded the Kindle App for Android.<br /><br />It downloaded quickly, set itself up and practically from the first minute I started using it, I was online searching for exactly the books wanted - big anthologies of the most famous poets. I found dozens and dozens of books that fit that description. And what really blew my mind was that most of them were FREE!  A few of the free ones did not have exactly what I wanted so I kept searching until I found what I wanted - the MOST I PAID was $8 for a 500 page anthology and most of the rest of the books were 99 cents to $1.99.<br /><br />So, if you are nervous about trying it, don't be! What's the worse thing that could happen? You delete the App and the books, big deal.<br /><br />Paul
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is really fun you can dress up your minion and fight victor is really cool. I also like how you can sign up to face book and he unicorn game is sweet.<br />woo yeah play it
B0053TMP24|2.0|I thought that Percy obsessing over Annabeth was really not like him and it was quite disappointing.Frank will NOT stop whining. And I hate whiny characters. Frank falls into the same trap Piper did. I hated that.Frank is also sixteen, with Hazel being thirteen. I find their relationship a little creepy at those ages. Maybe I wouldn't if they were ten years older, but they aren't, and since that is my age group, I know that most sixteen year olds don't usually get into relationships with thirteen year olds. Hazel was also quite whiny, and did I mention I hated that?
B0049J2BSM|5.0|On a 3 hr drive, I downloaded Monsters Inc. onto an iPad mini. Placed the ipad between the front seats and the kids watched it in its entirety!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What an excellent book.  This experience happened to this physician the only way that it could have that would have convinced him that it was real..... Fascinating reading
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|This is a mash-up of genres that really works well. It's part temple run, part bejeweled with 'puzzle quest' type rpg upgrades. It's a bunch of fun, though the best runs always involve a good deal of luck. I recommend it to folks that love a new twist of game lovingly wrapped in a retro 8-bit package.
1250007305|4.0|With the kinds of threats talked about in the book, you realize there isn't enough paranoia to go around. Relax. It's really just like described in the book but don't go overboard. Good read.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Cant make a movie out of a book like this.  Years after the zombie holocaust, survivors are interviewed, and their unedited interviews comprise this book.  Its all written in the first person, told by everyone from doctors to government officials to &#34;people in the street.&#34;  From this patchwork of hindsight, the truth slowly emerges of what actually happened, and how the pandemic was able to decimate the worlds population. Substitute &#34;zombie holocaust&#34; with the phrase &#34;flu pandemic&#34; and you might learn a few viable, real-life survival strategies from the strategies that DIDNT WORK in this book.
1400069289|5.0|Get a deeper look into how we set ourselves up for failure once we establish a habit in doing something. Eating, for me, has always been a struggle. I've lost a lot of weight but still fall back into old patterns. The book does a wonderful job of explaining it.
B0027MJU00|1.0|Loved gone girl so I decided to read this one. It's very boring , only the ending caught  my attention. The plot  is not that interesting. Would not recommend
B000EHSVS2|5.0|General Patton was one of my favorite WW2 generals and George C. Scott portrays him very well. This movie recounts Gen. Patton and his performances in the field of duty in the war. It is a movie that I can watch again and again and always see something I overlooked. I love it!
B007PF7MGS|4.0|Amazing how easy and tasty good health can be. I recommend the starch solution to anyone who wants to know the truth about food.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is a hilarious movie that combines great story with great music.  if you are looking for a move that will make you feel good, has great story, wonderful acting and great music (and BTW, I don't even like musicals), this is it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is awesome love it I should share it looked like A bad game but it wasnt how did you think of this
B008AIGWVA|5.0|We down loaded this game for my five year old daughter and she loves it! She thinks it is very funny!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Nice to dream away. Many hours of enjoyable reading. Looks very much like Fifty Shades but that's no problem. Like it
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The story and the pictures made it difficult to stop reading. I plan to read more books by the author.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the dry humor. All the characters are fascinating and complex.Maggie Smith is truly a gem. Can't wait for next season!
159514188X|5.0|This book was so well written, and i live how it goes back and forth between the main character and Hannah's recordings.  It also addresses many of the issues i've faced, including a suicide attempt.  However, this book is not easy to deal with, i got very emotional over it, and im not the kind of person who will laugh or cry because of a book, but this one is different, its truly touching
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Please, OOOOOOH PLEASE make another soon. Absolutely loved the almost steampunk like feel of game combined with the mystical story line. Really sucked me in. One of the best puzzle games ever.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I named my minion Bob! He's awesome! I loved him so much! He was the best! This game was awesome!:):):) :D :D :D
0470901071|5.0|I had to buy this book for a class, it came in useful. The book covered all of the subjects in class, it is easy to follow.Thanks for that fast delivery.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|If ur a manson fan u will find it very interesting to know his struggles & trials to get where he is.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the story line, the characters are strong and well written.  Looking forward to future seasons and changes to come.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Beautifully written.<br /><br />A heartwrenchingly crafted tale - you cannot put this one down. An echo for anyone who has loved.
B00AB16ER6|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he loves it because it reminds him of how music used to be from a time of plain old good rock and roll.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Interesting to see how divided the nation was at all level pre WW2.  I thought the accusation that Lindbergh was a Nazi Agent was not backed up by any facts.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have downloaded a few games on my Fire.  This one works very well, and I enjoy playing it.  I hope to introduce it to my grandchildren soon.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This novel is very well written. The characters are richly developed and you will ache for all of them. Raw and intense with a twist at the end that will keep you turning the pages.
B009VB97EY|4.0|everyone thinks iits all fun and games till you almost lose the girl.  Not just a strip tease movie thou it was about time that they make a guy version for us girls.  Nice plot to thou no depth really.  Just fun .
B001P8B8R0|5.0|I have ordered several animals from this company and I have need satisfied every time. The color and the detail are great, very realalistic, and for a good price. I use these animals for cake topper most of the time and are perfect.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great story and the movie made it come alive.  I recognized some Iranian landmarks, which added to the atmosphere. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys a good tale.
B008Y73940|5.0|EXCELLENT!!! Started off a little slow but great finish!!  I'd watch it again!! I am a big Mathew McConaughey fan, but this was one of his best ever!
B005K17RU0|3.0|This has lots of maps and news articles to choose from. I wanted just weather radar to track storms in the area. Was difficult to get it right, kept getting wrong information when I clicked on it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Really loved it. Can't wait for season 4. Love all of it,costumes, scenary, acting.....just great.It is one of the best shows.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|great book cant wait for the next one.love the dragon story wish there was more.how many more will there be
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I Love this game really fun cool power ups and you even get fight enemy's everyone should try this game
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Wonderful APP to have. Had no problems with the download and everything went AOK Continue with the good work. thank you
B000JMLFLW|3.0|This has been a slow read for me.  I expect to start it agin without many interruptions and delays.  I will  let you know after that.<br />Gene Boone
B005LAII08|5.0|It was new and it arrived fast. Very happy with the purchase in all respects. Excellent price as well as very good packing for a change.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Compelling!  I am so entwined in Gideon and Eva's life.  I can't believe there are two more books.  I have devoured each book many times.  Sylvia has a captivated audience of millions!!
B000FC2PKG|4.0|Good gripping story. I actually figures out who the real culpret was before reading the end but enjoyed the book a great deal.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|What a fantastic story of a dog and &#34;his man.&#34;  Usually it is a man and his dog, and what a faithful and intelligent animal he was.<br />No wonder a dog is called &#34;a man's best friend.&#34;
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a good time waster for all ages. Your mind works faster and faser to try and beat yourself<br />.
B0086700CM|1.0|For some reason every time this game ran, not all the controls would work and for a game like Temple Run, it ruins the game and is unplayable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great season, but sad ending. This poor family so many deaths in such a short time.  Each season is better and better.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|If you like challenging puzzles, this one is great for cracking your head over. More fun with others to try to figure it out.
B00AQ2G7D6|5.0|Equals meet in a game of love, deception. Interesting sport one of which is organized bank robbing along with polo and gliders. Never a dull moment in love, adventure and mystery. Script is exceptional and Directors choices go well with the musical score. Don't miss it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so addicting. I find myself getting up in the middle of the night, still thinking of how to escape! Might be a bit easy for those who have played similar games, but still fun.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|The Marware case is performing as well as the video advertised.  Because of the case it allows me to take my Kindle any where.
B0030B624E|5.0|if you have not seen this movie you dont know what life is. i am vary impressed by woody h. it was all in all a great movie.
0471463396|4.0|Value investing is one style of investing.  The current market is not made for this style there will need to be another melt-down to be a small, successful value investor.  People point to Warren Buffet as the best value investor there is - he certainly is the most visible and successful - and people forget many of his rules of engagement.  Berkshire makes between 8 and 20 billion dollars a year and W.B. maintains a war chest between 40 and 80 billion dollars while looking for something to buy.  How many of us can walk into BofA and purchase the top of the line, 'redeem me first' stocks?  If you walked in the door with a suite case filled with 5 billion dollars you could also - this does not make BofA a good stock nor a good purchase for the average Joe.  Even with all that Value Investing is still a good investing strategy when the market allows.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Nice size buttons on the key board to see and use large visible digits to read. Clean and simple with all the essentials.
0345525558|3.0|Nice premise but it moves pretty slow.  Didn't receive the cover featured, which is lovely!  Needed a bit more plausible plot.
B0030A0ZD4|3.0|product was in great condition, works just fine but stupid people cut out some parts from the original. sorry, just disappointing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best game in the store I wish there were more levels though and the costumes Use bananas instead of the tokens
B00DF0POXA|5.0|The album represents a change from the ordinary and expected. Its more like &#34;Kanye in concert&#34; The tracks sound like being at a stadium watching a live performance. Only Kanye could make an album like this. Its not for anyone who only appreciates the ordinary.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book was selected for our book club. IT took me a long time to get into it and then it flew by. I was shocked at the Irish Orphanage system and the way children were treated. I was even more shocked to read that the system was not shut down until 1996!  The author does a good job of describing harsh, lonely living conditions without graphic detail.  The reader is left to fill in those details using one's imagination and that is more than enough.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Was such a touching and well written story. The back story is so interesting and knowing it was based on the real &#34;Orphan Train&#34; which I had never heard of was very interesting.  Highly recommend for a nice summer read!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|My favorite all time book, I just had to have it in my kindle, I may just read it over and over again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great ap. I played it with my kids. They had a blast. Great time waster. Patien tly waiting for more rooms.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|My kid loves it and I find that they become so addicted that it works as a motivator at home, incentives like this are necessary for me, thank you.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|A classic movie for all Flans out there (Firefly Fans = Flans).  Plenty of great features and a MUST HAVE for your collection.
B007SGM084|5.0|While much hype is made of the &#34;graphic sex&#34; in these books, it is not portrayed in a manner usually associated with porn and I do not consider them as such.  The surprise is that there is a mystery plot throughout the books that has a lot of twists and turns to keep you guessing and wondering what will happen to whom.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Fantastic cast, well played by all. The great Maggie Smith is superb. I like it that they cast real older actors to plat the parts of the residents. Music was often glorious. Nice job, Dustin Hoffman!
B007NVJ7NU|1.0|* Visuals, mostly boring and not really all that psychedelic or interesting.  Very migraine inducing however.<br />* Plot ... a 5 minute short film's worth ... and guessable half way, even while skipping forward 5 minutes for every minute spent hurting my brain watching it.<br />* Intellectual value ... zero, unless you are very poorly educated or not very well versed in philosophy and religion.  Time better spent reading pamphlets handed to you by crazy people on the street.<br />* Acting ... lol ... sure ... whatever<br />* Character development ... one predictable twist that takes two hours to show up, and then, does so in another painfully LOOOOOOONG scene that the viewer has gotten what they needed from it in the first 30 seconds ... and then suffer for 5 more minutes of throbbing, droning sounds and blurry visuals.<br /><br />Egad.  People who think they are deep will really love this I bet, because nobody else will.
B003I55BIA|4.0|I want me an Alex Fuentes of my own. This book was really engrossing, and even though the ending was super cheesy ...well, maybe because the ending was super cheesy, I don't regret spending an evening reading this. I admit I teared up a little. Always a good sign. I even grudgingly liked the heroine by the end of the novel. She really undergoes a transformation, and turns into a much better person. So does Alex.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is riveting; characters are charming, and the story is quite compelling. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|My family loved this movie and we laughed.  We loved the premise of retired CIA agents that can still kick ass.  Bruce Willis and John Malkovich were amazing.  John was hilarious.  Helen Mirren was a delight and I was taken aback at how strikingly beautiful she can be.  Great movie.  I can't wait the see the sequel.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Why did it have to end? Khalid has done it again in the writing of this beautiful, moving story! I literally could not put it down. Thank you, Mr. Hosseini, for your genius in the art of story telling. I can't wait for the next one. Please?
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie in so many ways.  The casting is superb.  When the Phantom takes Christine to his liar, the scene and the songs are just chilling.  The acting is wonderful, the scenery, the costumes - everything about this movie is over the top.
0307476073|3.0|I think my title says it all. Its just another one of those \\"I need to find myself\\" books that consumers eat up like they're mindless spiritual zombies.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|My wife and I love just about any movie where Maggie Smith is cast.  This movie's story line is very interesting and the actors bring it to life superbly.  I recommend this movie.
B003VANOFY|2.0|Pros:<br /><br />- Headset is comfortable on my head, even for hours at a time. (My office is air conditioned, or they would probably have been hot.)<br /><br />- The volume controls were nice, no guessing where they were in the dark.<br /><br />- I could wander all over my house with these on and it still had good reception.<br /><br />- The headset itself appears to be made well.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The speakers were distorted even at lower volumes. I tried everything to stop them from getting distorted, but in the end I had to  keep them so low that I might as well have turned them off.<br /><br />- The bass boost was nice except when something with bass happened in a game, and then it was crazily distorted.<br /><br />- The headset lost connection during games on a regular basis. After 30 seconds to a minute it would come back.<br /><br />- The wireless bass lost connection to the USB port on a regular basis. Windows would bong over and over and over as the connection reappeared and dropped over and over and over.<br /><br />I basically bought these to wear in my office so I could hear over my AC unit. It turns out it's just easier to crank the volume on my surround speakers. I have a lot of Logitech stuff, and I was surprised by how many issues this headset had. I think I may either get a wired pair or another brand of wireless.

B0057R5XRG|4.0|Definitely reference quality discs.  The 7.1 DTS HD really delivers every thump and roar.  I only got this because it was on sale and I have never seen JP3.  It was a good bargain.  I wish they can clean up the film track a bit.  HD really brings the bad quality blue/green screen CGIs... (in the third movie).  I will skip the second because it was bad.  Other than The Fly, I can't stand watching Jeff Goldblum for more than an hour.
B008JFUNYG|4.0|++revisited/revision -<br />After a cool off time where my expectations were not so high, I re-watched this movie. It is really very good and an effective horror movie. Unlike the horror movies of the last 1-2 decades, this one doesn't give you any comedy to \\"relieve\\" the tension (in the 80's, post Exorcist, the studios decided that horror movies needed to give you a break from the tension the movie caused by adding some humor. This was some psycho babble that caused most of the horror movies from then on to have silly characters or humor in every single horror movie for the next several decades!) They have FINALLY gotten away from that idea and are starting to give us horror movies that don't give you a break from the tension. This movie is one of those that just doesn't let up. I still agree they need better contacts, but this movie will get to you. I added a star to my original review (below).<br /><br />I appreciate them not using CGI. Unfortunately, they did not use state of the art practical SFX. The contacts are terrible. You just cannot put those cheap contacts in someones eyes and have  them look good. In fact, the use of the lenses pulls me right out of the movie. If they were going practical, they should have got the best contacts or done something else. Linda Blair's eyes in the exorcist look hideous and they are practical (and from decades ago). I know focusing on the eyes may seem excessive, but the rest of the effects are so amazingly horrifying, making the eyes look realistically messed up would have added at least one star to the score.<br />It is trying for a more serious tone, so it lacks the manic craziness of the original. If you haven't seen the original, from the reviews  here, this remake is pretty good. It just doesn't live up to the original, trademark, Sam Rami crazy creativeness
1584233494|2.0|The problem with Shepard Fairey is that as a artist he has not evolved. This is evident in this book. While i like his process and his lines. He is little more than a commercial graphic artist that tugs on the heart strings on liberal minded patrons.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Fun to play at first but VERY hard to get items that take months to finally win. You have to rely on team mates to trade and get items. People get really irritated.
1451695195|3.0|The patient only exceeded Lazarus' miracle. Its a believable story, but requires the greatest of faith. Faith healing or one of the greatest modern medical miracles, I don't know which, I couldn't even hazard a guess ?
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Action scenes are the high point of the movie.  The story line is not believable, but then one expects that in this type genre.  I'm grateful it did not have a great abundance of sexually explicit 4-letter words which so many movies nowadays seem to put in as &#34;boilerplate.&#34;  The subtitles translating Russian to English did not stay on the screen long enough for us to read.  Am glad it had some lighter moments of levity, and I always like happy endings!
B00821OX98|5.0|End of days type of show. Great special effects!  Excellent cast. Each ep. leaves you wanting more, more.  If you are a sci fi fan you will love this show.
B00957T6X6|5.0|It's really more of a soap opera set in a fantasy world than a fantasy novel.<br /><br />They're a bit long winded with the descriptions of food and clothing, but still well worth the read even if you've seen the show.<br />The basic plot is the same as the HBO series, but the books have a lot more texture due to two important things:<br /><br />First, there's a lot more conversations; you get all this banter between the characters and you love/hate them so much more.<br /><br />Second, the perspectives; while a tv show has a gods eye perspective, the book is divided into short chapters, each from a different characters perspective. These chapters are masterfully jaded to that character's viewpoint, and it really gives you an empathetic view of Martin's world. He's almost as good as William Gibson in the way he empathizes with everyone and the voice changes drastically and realistically with each character.<br /><br />I read the books before I saw the series, and I'm not going to go on a rant about how the books are always better, because they did as good a job as they could manage with 10hrs per season, but the books are much richer and textured. Definitely worth the read.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Very good balance between voice acting story and the levels integrate what the story tells perfectly along with level names
B008KYOCA2|5.0|This calendar is easy to use and will sync with your Google Calendar.  However, if you are like me and do not want Google having more information about you, you can easily export your events to a file on the tablet and then copy that file to another computer as backup.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|this is the best tv series I have ever watched,totally hooked can't wait for season  two hope it's as great.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|Read this free book for a great overview of what html5 is today and will be in the near future.

B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great game and hours of fun. Love the Blue tooth play for multiplayer makes for a great time and easy clean-up and move. Nice to see the option to construct your own deck from sealed packs make its way to this version.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I don't normally read this type of book, but it came up as recommended based on other books purchased. I still don't understand why,  but it was a good book, right up until the end.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was very intriguing and well writes. I am not sure why other readers are criticizing the ending - it is exactly fitting to the story and characters.  I recommend this book.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Truly inspiring work of literature, it really makes one appreciate the natural beauty of solitude and the world around them.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Story lines flow smoothly, are easy to read and follow, and are stimulating.  Still reading in first stories.  Thank you

B00B2V66VS|1.0|My Norton Security program said it contained a malicious file so I didn't install it. I would not take a chance with this program.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Very interesting reading with very detailed research that creates an easy to read narrative of the relationships of a sitting president to those who preceded ...
159463176X|4.0|Enjoyed the read. the shift from character to character was a bit confusing. beautiful language. I would have preferred a different ending.
B00AB7IA1S|5.0|Nice to see a game that isn't copying the level select of angry birds for once. Neat game, only a couple levels in but it looks like it'll get pretty tricky soon.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|A great compilation of Phil Collins' best music.  I enjoy it and you can't beat the price nowadays.  I paid almost $11 for this years ago.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|Think we would have really liked this movie, especially as we purchased it on the last night of a three day visit from houseguests and sort of needed the entertainment by then, but the video kept freezing and refusing to start again until we went through the entire network connection process.  After about 20 attempts went to Netflix using the same equipment and streamed with no difficulty so I think the problem was with Amazon
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the hunger games I have read it almost twice I got the third book to go !!!!!!!! Love it!!!!!!!
B000AP04NI|3.0|The DVD quality is fine...it is just a very typical 50's story. I can hardly believe how far we have come in understanding the emotional side of life with sensibility since then. This couple has no real reason to be falling in love, nothing in common...and Ado Annie is too dumb to be real. Singing was great.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book is well written, thoroughly researched and very informative. It is a very emotional book as well as a scientific book. I had a bit of trouble following all of the scientific information as that is not my area of knowledge. Overall I think the author did an excellent job.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Keeping in mind that I can't understand what they are singing, they are four very beautiful strong voices and their music is rich and full.<br />Great background for dinner (softly) or just easy listening enjoyment.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|This book starts the process of thinking about how the world is changing.  I guess we are all late to the party but the quicker we see what is going on the faster we can chart a new course.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|great feel good show will watch it over and over. You should buy this film. You will not be disappointed.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Shocked by the abrupt ending; it was like she ran up on a deadline and was forced to stop so that the book could be put out without another delay. I won't be buying any more from this series.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|A football player named Flash must help save the world from a evil Alein Emporier. He must travel to different kindgoms. .

The strange world Jenn is form is inhabited by kind knowledgable elder beings and Evil Retitle power hungery beings. A great movie one of my favorites. Can two worlds combine or be destroyed.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|I've been a Star Trek fan since I was a kid (watching the original series when it first aired).  For some reason, I didn't watch Enterprise when it aired, but have always loved the other series I've seen (Original, TNG and DS9).  This hasn't disappointed in the least.  It's also really fun being able to watch it on my Kindle.  I'm on the go a lot, so my down time doesn't always happen at home.  The portability is great, and this series is fabulous!
