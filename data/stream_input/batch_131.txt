B000CPCD9Y|5|After inspecting and finding our stick rubber bushings are cracking we found these. Perfect solution to replace rubber shock bushings.
B005IZCRW6|5|Like new or better performance. Easy installation and no problems after a few months.
B001EOV46K|5|It arrived on time, as described by Amazon & manufacturer, it was shipped on time, arrived within prescribed estimates, the packaging was undamaged, and the product itself was unmolested and made with quality materials.  The device, although cosmetic at best, little functionality regarding rust prevention or dirt, fit very well and is currently doing its job.  I have no complaints with this product as it is durable, quality made, and as I stated, cosmetic for me, it does reduce the socket's exposure to harsh weather and thereby reducing its proclivity for wear and tear/exposure degradation.
B000CM3H06|4|Fit and appearance are fine. The mirror itself shakes a bit at highway speed so the image is blurry at times but otherwise it works very well.
B001I0ZGDM|4|Nice to have a license plate frame with out words all over it...
B0012ZITCS|5|Goes on & off extremely easy..Best I've used!!<br />Definitely recommend and will buy again.<br />F Wilson<br />Seven Mile Ohio<br />Maintenance Mechanic
B00LGKZ64S|5|Very happy with the product and with the results!!!
B0043C55AG|5|This hex set is incredible.  Love that it's magnetic, just don't forget it's resting on your fender!  Would love to see a kit like this of metric sockets.<br />Using this in my motorcycle tool kit.
B001OZJNUS|1|Doesn't work at all, it adj too high or off,  I will not order this again, unless it is faulty, but it's new?
B00BGBWNFC|5|It looks awesome! Nice color too! It goes on very easy. Exactly what we wanted! Would order this product again.
B008GVBM70|5|[[VIDEOID:moX722QEZQD2HO]]Pros: This light is very bright. It was also larger than I expected which is nice. The white led lights seem to flash brighter than the yellow. All 3 patterns are great as seen in the video. Love that it adjusts enough so that it works on my Jeep wrangler's windshield (which is at a more vertical angle than most vehicles) and still points straight ahead. Great value for the money.<br /><br />Cons: Yes the cord and plug are cheap looking as others reviewers suggest.  I am careful and haven't had a problem. Also, the suction cup did not stick overnight on a cooler night.  But never falls off while driving.<br /><br />Overall its great.
B00ECXSI5U|5|The color is great!! Bought it for my daughters Ranger. Goes great with a different blue.
B002CXS596|5|This worked perfectly with the existing stock holes in the rear window. Didn't have to modify anything. Will purchase again when I manage to break this one. Although, this one seems MUCH higher quality than the OEM part, and it's cheaper. Imagine that!!
B007ILG7V0|5|Looks great on the back of my truck
B004IA5CA6|5|Got a super fast delivery. Great price, great quality and even better looks. I'm a super satisfied customer. My other friends who also have Jeep's are asking me about how to but it as well. Recommend t 100%.
B001CF53PY|4|Pretty tight first couple times on, but great buy and great quality. I would definitely recommend this cover io a friend.
B001G8ME6S|2|Finally got around to reviewing this product installed it on my car within 12 months all the chrome flecked off, it is now a dull piece of plastic, not like the product got rubbed or abused, just weathered away.
B001Y91KIM|1|the tips keep braking off i lost 3 of them thats why i got 4 moe and lost 2 of them soory but ant much if i can buy some steel ones ill buy them in a hart beat. i lov doing business with you ill keep on with yours the caps will not make me quit ordering<br /><br />  thank you<br />  steve cox
B008CPOXOO|4|Only the staple is little big , is little hard put in the trigger . But for now do the job, I fix a lot with this stable, and good price
B00AAZNTUS|5|Great addition to our golf cart.
B000IYBJAS|4|Title says it all.  You need to decide how important visibility is for you because all these wiper blades wear out at the same way - quickly.
B0002F66V0|5|I selected this accumulator due to the size. Small enough to fit into tight places and well made. I had to tape the threaded 1/2\\" fittings to seal them against a 125 psi load but other than that worked great!
B003P655FG|4|Its all about the &#34;U&#34;  its just not big enough. It was a gift and person liked it. Its a &#34;U&#34;
B00A3WIW78|4|This is a well constructed product. It is not quite as bright was I thought it would be though. Next time I will purchase one with more led's. Fast shipment thru amazon.
B00CEPVJPY|5|The Monroe 901656 Max-Lift Gas Charged Lift shocks fit our 2007 Toyota Sequoia perfectly and were very easy to install. These shocks have more lift than OEM had when the vehicle was new.
B00ARL1HH2|5|so bright very good product and good price
B0073JK650|1|this turbo doesn't fit on a 2005 Legacy GT like it says here. I contacted the company that makes them and they told me to move the housing around to try and make it fit. After that didn't work they wanted me to use the old housing with the new casing which doesn't really work if you want a &#34;new&#34; turbo.  Now they won't even pay for the return even though it's obviously a manufacturers fault.
B0012X0I6A|5|Worked perfectly! Fits only air ride suspension Expeditions and Navigators
B000KPU8JI|4|I only wish I would have went with the Power Probe III. The voltmeter would have made the difference. But this one does everything advertised.
B003TTL0TE|5|Great product definitely buying again
B00435F64I|1|Does not work.
B0034Y2VS8|5|I have used these oil filters in two Subaru's and a Mazda for more than five years.  They deliver the service as advertised, without fail.
B00415CKEE|5|exact match to factory
B006NYJFTE|5|Perfect fit for my 1995 Chevy Silverado (C1500) Cartagena - Colombia
B000BGJWA2|5|Very well built. Fit really well. Far better quality than original unit on trailer.
B00D7QHLN8|5|It's not installed yet but it looks like it would work.
B004C69LPS|5|Original product,
B005SAJDFU|4|As an owner of greyhounds, I thought this tag looked more like the way greyhounds do than others I had investigated.<br />It's realistic and very pretty, but it's awfully \\"busy\\" so that the greyhounds in the picture aren't really the big focus. They blend in with all the plants and backgrounds.
B001KS2R34|5|Worth the price.
B002IEIGES|4|stronger than the store sprays
B0091V81H8|5|great
B00433SIQI|4|Works as it says. Nice to have all the tools you need for the job in one box. I used the hard side of the squeegy to precision cut the film on the window
B007Y4PHM6|5|I work with large 6v batteries every day, and this handle is just the right size to fit around them. It fits securely, it's comfortable to hold for a while when I have to carry the battery a long way, and it's not so tall that I can't maneuver the batteries in and out of tight spaces. I'm very happy with this, and the guys in the shop are jealous!
B00080QHMM|5|Excellent
B000CKDPM8|4|I bought 2 of these rotors for a 2003 Corolla. First let me say that they fit and performed fine. However, the 2 rotors were not 100% identical. There were minor machining differences between the 2 rotors. The most significant difference was one rotor had the two threaded removal holes and the other one did not. There were other machining differences but I decided to install them anyway since the car was older with high mileage and I needed to get it back on the road. The boxes the rotors came in had identical part numbers and the date codes indicated they were manufactured less than two months apart. By the way they are made in China. They are a good value for the money but I gave them 4 stars because they were not identical.
B000XBJ5UM|5|What can I say it was perfect with no problem, but I wish they had an instruction  sheet in it, because I have a couple of o rings left over and no place to put them
B001DRHMMS|5|It works for 2007 BMW 328i Coupe. It did not fit perfectly, but I got it in. After the filter has been replaced, there is a significant change in the smell of cabin air. I will buy this product again.
B0068EVJS4|4|Nice, but doesn't come with the interior frame that makes it hold it's shape. All one has to do, however, is fashion one that runs the length and width of the bottom. I used the cover from a three ring binder, which I trimmed to work perfectly.
B0013GF8AC|4|I bought this for my sister, her jeep is all tweety so this was perfect! She loves it and it's made pretty well. It didn't cost much either.
B0098WEIVS|5|I love it
B000FW2MC2|5|Best idea ever if you have a flat area to put it.. Works great.. Just make sure you have a spot for it..
B00PRXPYRO|1|Glue gun had a Erupean plug so i had to buy an American one...and the glue doesnt stick to the dent...I tried several times.
B00C2NSTXI|5|The dealer wanted $299.00 to install a new handle. Finding it here and having it already painted was perfect and seemed to be a good price. It was a little tricky at times to install but I managed. It fits and works great.  I'm happy to easily get in my car again.
B000CNBBUI|1|This is the second visor I have bought that does not fit a 2003 f150 crew cab.  It said it would on the vehicle check feature.  Not too sure why that is but the window shape is definitely different that what I have been sent.  The visor has rounded edges which will not work in a squared off window frame.  The picture depits a squared off shape so be careful on this one.
B0009Y4XDM|5|This intake installs into a Honda Civic D15B7 or D15B8 motor in under 30 minutes. The performance increase is immediately noticable and it makes the motor sound awesome when opened up under load. The best 104 dollars I ever spent on my car. This is a must have if you have either of these motors.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that the instructions ask you disconnect some part from the coolant system and for this style short ram intake, that is not necessary, at least not on the D15B7 or B8 motors.<br /><br />Excellent product for a reasonable price. And it's CARB compliant to boot.
B001KS6FPA|5|Works as advertised.
B00B3YMOUQ|4|These bags are great for the price. Just as a side note I have never purchased or owned saddle bags before, so in all fairness I am writing as a first experience and have nothing to compare or add contrast too. The reason that I did not give this set up a five star rating is that these bags are much too large for my motorcycle (2007 Yamaha R6). If you are on a tight budget, not planning to use these for an everyday commute. Then you could work with these, the quality seems durable and all required components are provided. The bags do sag and may swing causing unwanted shifting movement while riding especially at higher rates of speed. The solution I am going to do is look for or create some kind quick disconnect bracket much like another brand by Twisted Throttle.  I have posted some photos of the product. I will also update how they look on my R6.
B0055UCRRY|2|did not work for my car.
B008GVBM70|3|amber not bright enough to show through tint on windshield
B00FFH7QGE|5|looks so nice in my car
B00E9FVPTM|5|I love this my man loves it he is always using it!
B001P2DSR4|5|Topline C111S Polished Stainless Steel Center Cap<br /><br />These polished S/S caps have dressed up the chrome rims on my 5th wheel RV so nice.  I have received many nice comments from fellow RV owners from many different states. No more rusty center caps.
B007558IQG|5|Love the decal....exactly as described.  It was a big surprise for my daughter who thought she was done receiving Christmas gifts.  LOL.  Have not been able to put it on the car yet as it is way too cold here.  Hopefully we don't have any problems.  I will add more to this review if we have trouble.
B001KRY896|5|I had broken the little knob that turns the lights on/off.<br />Found a video on youtube and replaced this myself in about an hour.<br />I didn't even need a steering-wheel puller (though you might)<br />NOTE: The metal retaining clip on this is not the same that was on my 2005 Prius (though it is as it is in the picture) It had a larger flange. IT was however very easy to swap it out with the one from my car (so no stars removed)<br />Be sure to read about unhooking the Airbag safely (removing your car's battery for 1 hour before etc) before trying this yourself as it can be deadly dangerous if done incorrectly.
B00DU6R7Q6|3|Fogs up when riding hard but works ok for trail riding. Runs on the large side got a medium and fits like a large. Decent helmet for the sale price.
B0081ZYYR6|5|I had never had bags and felts for our winter tires and wheels.  I finally bought them and am glad I did.  They organize our garage, make transporting the wheels easier and cleaner, and protect them well.  The felt is nice and thick.  There are two felts in each package so I only bought two packages (4 felts) to protect the front of each wheel, not the back.  When you stack them in the garage, each wheel sits on the felt of the wheel below it (except for the bottom wheel).  Four felts are all that is really necessary if you would like to save some money.
B0022ZF2ZO|5|Super great put need to be sold in set.
B006OEYQAQ|5|Product is as described - it's a replacement for the oem power antenna and fits perfectly. It's a good thing there's youtube - miata king explains in detail on how to replace the antenna. Unless you've done this before, figuring it out on your own is difficult. The only thing I would add is that grease needs to be applied so that the antenna will fully retract.
B00L7X95D2|4|It was deliver on time and it fit perfect on my chevy suburban great price
B00CC303H8|5|I bought this product to replace a set I bought on ebay.  This one has a much better quality build.  It is thinner and cables look higher quality.  No noise when I turn on the lights like my previous set.
B00BFEU81Q|5|Great packing, perfect color match, the modding was high quality, plenty of adhesive 3m on entire strip of molding and extra at each end, if you put these on right, they will never come off!<br /><br />I would recommend.
B000C0TDEC|5|Perfect fit for my 99 Jeep XJ. Looks to be a well made hose. It is thick and not flimsy. Should hold up for quite a while.
B00042KGMG|4|I should have gotten one size shorter... This one is TALL for a Jeep anyways
B003RVIXP8|5|The worked perfectly.  After programming, all functions worked the same as dealership key. The only downside is that the door key still needs to be cut.
B00FG5RL38|1|Doesnt fit the truck specified for
B004VTJ912|5|Took a chance purchasing this light since I couldn't find an image of it installed anywhere.  Easy to install, and looks great.  Doesn't come with detailed installation instructions, but you can find them on forums or youtube.
B003O0VYHQ|4|I bought two. They work but are a little too strong, especially at the end of the opening position.  Everytime I open it the liftgate will hit and bump hard at the end and shake the whole van. You get used to it though.
B000ALBSXM|4|I didn't believe reviewers who said I was smart enough to install these in my 1997 Accord wagon. Trust me; you're smart enough to install these in your Accord wagon. Make sure you order the desired side (or one of each) by observing this equation: (L) = left; (R) = right
B00MZ1NAT0|5|I love it
B00Q5YMKDK|5|They look so cute love them
B001HJR9XE|1|NOT easy to install as advertised, still on the back floorboard of the car because even though my husband has tried several times he can't get it installed and no one around our area will install it.  A waste of money and time!
B0041QOS7A|5|He seemed to like it and it was well made and fit as described.  The pattern is very modern and racing appropiate.
B002OUPFOU|5|Good product. Priced right, easy to install and works well for dock water application on boats. The back flow valve is a plus.
B000GTU0IM|5|Bought it on tuesday night and it arrived on thur morning. fits nice on my honda shadow aero. keeps the rain off and is very secure, i don't have to worry about it flying off with a strong wind.
B000LG5O2W|5|Works great , easy to follow programming instructions too!
B007L57Y6A|2|I waited for a long time for this to ship, I bought X-Large thinking it would shrink.  Well it's not really VW Authentic merchandise, at least I don't think and it was great, until I washed it and now it will fit a kid.  So make sure if you do buy this that you are very careful when you wash it.
B001OMLA2K|5|Exactly what I expected. Goes on easy and provides a quieter ride and lots of shade. A cheap 1st soft top!
B004J6G4OM|5|Fit my 04 Grand Cherokee fine.
B00BZSDN5U|5|Well made, high quality exhaust tip that installed in minutes with a heavy-duty clamp. Positioned bolt at 12 o'clock, but be sure to have a deep socket. Looks great.
B004LWTHP2|5|We wanted this NOCO Battery Charger and Maintainer for more the maintaining and restoring functions (and as backup in case a battery dies).<br /><br />We have used it to restore the batteries on both our older lawn mower and our car. The process was relatively easy once we read the manual and figured out how to do it. The manual that came with the charger leaves much to be desired. It has very small print and very little information. The Charger itself is small and light which is nice for storing.<br /><br />Since we have not had a dead battery since receiving this product, it is hard to give it a full proper review. However, I will update this if one of our batteries dies. As far as I can tell, it is a great charger to own. I definitely feel safer knowing that we have it if one of our batteries does decide to die.
B00TQ07IOQ|5|The price, quality , & fit was perfect. And the UPS girl was wearing shorts. It don't get much better than that..
B002C7E5FU|5|I love love these mats! I wanted to add a little something to my car and these were it! The quality and color are just amazing!
B00B30HT28|5|Fit perfect! Great value!!!!
B00K0OE1UQ|5|These mirrors fit perfectly on my old Jeep.  They don't bounce or vibrate, they're heavy duty.<br />I would suggest them to anyone.
B000C08XAW|5|Well, It's not new as the summary indicates.  It is remanufactured.  Slight pitting showed were rust had been sandblasted away and there were a few dinged up threads.  Finish was bare steel.  Nevertheless, this item fit perfectly on my 1978 CJ5 (with 6 bolt caliper brakes.)  I have had trouble finding the correct booster in the past since Jeep changed things mid year for 1978.  Why doesn't anybody publish the bolt patterns?  This one has a 3.75 inch by 3.5 inch bolt pattern to the bell crank/pedal bracket and a 3.375 bolt pattern to the master cylinder.  All studs are 3/8-16 threads.  Outer diameter is about 8.5 inches including the case joints, main diameter is about 8 inches.  Push rod is not adjustable but was the correct length.  I had to slightly adjust my brake pedal switch as some of my linkage is worn.  Fit great, works great.  Awesome to be able to stop without doing leg presses.
B00D9D6WP2|5|good product but i should have got Bi xeon
B001QQ0BFQ|2|loudest pump I've ever heard. very anoying when on. Don't use it much but the thing will wake the dead
B000YTN7KW|1|After opening the package,I realized there were no directions for the product.  I installed the CD which did have the instruction manual.  I would have had to print at least 20 pages(I stopped counting)instead I took my PC to my vehicle to try the unit out.  I followed directions to a T,and it wouldn't connect to either of my vehicles.  So back inside and did more reading.  I finally gave up and went to the company website and found an update that I downloaded.  So I tried to upload the update to the dash dyno,it wouldn't accept or read the update.  I gave up after 45 mins or so and waited for the wife to get home since she is a computer wiz.  It took her 20 mins and something about going in through the back door?  Back out and hooked it to my truck,again following the directions.  After getting the same error message 4 times,it recognized and connected to my truck.  Your supposed to take the memory card out and plug it in the PC to have the CD load info on it.  I did that,and reinserted the memory card into the dash dyno.  Now the dash dyno won't read the memory card.  So I try and load the files from the CD again,same thing.  I try a smaller memory card from my camera thinking I may have a bad card.  Same thing.  So, I decide I'll try to read live data and forget about saving the data.  The dash dyno won't work on my '03 Cummins pickup and decide to try it on my '96 Caprice SS.  Now it won't connect to it.  After several tries it does connect and won't read any live data.  I decide to trip a trouble code and see if it will even read and reset trouble codes.  It won't even do that.  In my opinion,I got a bad unit.  But...after going to several websites,I read about frustrated users with similar problems.  I also read about happy users.  Once the company comes up with better quality control,adds more processor speed so it doesn't take so long going from one file or program to another and provides a printed instruction manual,they may have a decent product.  I gave it One star because it does have a sweet mount.  Nice heavy duty unit.t One star because it does have a sweet mount.  Nice heavy duty unit.
B001U04MHG|5|Hubby got this light a couple of years ago for Christmas and we used it for everything.  Unfortunately, left it at a campsite last summer. Glad I found it to put in his stocking this year!!!!  The magnet on the bottom is so handy. Overall a great gift.
B008B5U5U6|5|No problems.
B009FUF6DM|4|Could be a bit thicker material, kind of sheds until first wash.
B0049Z8X4C|1|It broke after a couple of weeks being in my pocket...I wrote seller an email waiting for a reply.
B000C3YTM0|5|I can't comment on how these filters work, if they are better than other brands, but at the very least they seem to do their job well. However, the easy removal nut on the back end of the canister is definitely worth paying a little extra for. No more fiddling around with oil wrench straps, no more having to hammer a screwdriver through the filter because it just won't come off. Just grab a 1 in. socket and you're good to go!
B008VGRMJC|5|Very nice. Good product.
B000BQYH6Q|2|These are a little thin and flimsy for my taste--definitely not heavy duty.  I fear they will actually crush if a car rolled up against them.  And they do not have good friction to the ground.  Therefore, I am not sure they would hold back a car or trailer.  Their lightweight construction makes them nice to have in the trunk.
B00JU65OP6|5|This is a quality product and I would be proud to recommend it to my friends.
B0002Q80GS|5|This plug connector is all you can ask for.  Heavy gauge wire, all the connectors you need sealed very well.  I would put this plug up against OEM any day.  Great product, great price!
B00LU1A0RQ|5|This was the best gift I ever bought my mother-in-law!  It is still on the back of her jacket.
B003M200MQ|4|Got this for my dad. The white color is actually ivory and the straps are white.it's a little thinner than the defender. Thats  1 star less.<br />Offers a decent area of protection. I liked that there is an option to strap the bottom part  to the bumper.
B007HGF29Y|5|Just what the doctor ordered!
B001VJZOBO|4|I had one of these many years ago.  When it stopped working I just didn't replace it.  When I did decide to use another parking aid, I couldn't find one locally.<br />It just makes it so much easier to park in the garage without having to get out and make sure all the car is inside.  The only reason I did not rate it &#34;5-stars&#34; is because it is just a bit sensitive.  You have to pull in slowly for the lights to progress propely from red to green.  Other than that, it is just perfect.
B00NHMU5VC|1|Throttle grip is too big to turn inside throttle tube.  Garbage Chinese design.
B000EQD4L2|5|not much else to say ... haven't had any issues with my spark plugs since changing out my old ones with these new ones.
B005FJXWP6|5|I put these on my 2007 Honda Accord three weeks ago, my first time replacing a rotor. It was shaking terribly whenever I braked hard, especially on the highway. These were easy to install (once I got the right tools), and braking is very smooth now. I'm very pleased with the product and am planning on doing the same on our 2005 Honda Pilot soon.
B001OQO67M|5|had it in my 04 silverado for about a year now, still doing its job and keeping the carpet clean.  not only that, but its been a perfect fit since day one.
B0001XPC7C|3|The stiff springs holding the coins in place combined with the weakly glued top and bottom pieces results in a coin explosion after loading this compact portable coin holder.  Before loading this thing, I reccommend that you take some super glue and re-glue the top and bottom pieces together and then take some black tape and reinforce it, otherwise you may have a coin explosion when it falls apart when you try to load it. After glueing and taping it back together, it works fine, but it shouldn't have fallen apart just by loading it full of coins.
B003RGEL40|5|Excellent
B00HS5VNM4|3|Do not break as well conventional breaks. Took a long time to break in even following break in procedures. They have a shudder at mid speed breaking. When I get a chance I am going back to a conventional pad but i will keep the sloted rotors.
B00N47E87W|5|good fit, nice parts.
B000WK2CR2|4|Do not forget to charge this before installing
B00CFBT90O|5|Easy to install. Thanks
B00KPR2R7C|5|Just installed on a 2010 Honda CRV. Took me a full day plus taking my time. I like that there is no box to remove and that it uses power brakes to stop and not a dead pedal. The install was actually easy but took some time because its not something you install frequently. A little bit of fine tuning needed to get it working the way you want. Had to email questions a couple of times and they were responsive. Watch the 38 minute You Tube video installation before starting. They include this with a CD.
B00KEZ8X6E|5|Nice
B006CRT72W|5|The key remote worked great and looks exactly like the factory one. The price was great especially compared to what my local Ford Dealer wanted for one. Set up was simple, just make sure you have all your remotes with you because they will need to be reprogrammed along with the new, but again it's just the push of one button.
B000BTLUJK|4|Sosos
B005H52V0A|5|Great product Love the light it produces I can see more raid coverage the regular headlights  I have a set in every car I own lovely product and fast shipping
B008SEBQ2G|4|Works better than I thought for such a short antenna. I listen to satellite radio 98% of the time so I did it more for the looks.
B001P2B998|2|I have a 97 TJ, and before I even ordered these flares, I removed the stock ones just to make sure I wouldn't run into too many issues.  Stock ones came off with no problems, took maybe an hour.  Ordered these flares and recieved them in two days(thanks Prime).  Got up early on the next day to install these bad boys, opened the box and all the hardware is there, all the flares are there, and everything is intact.  Pulled the front flares out of the plastic bags to do a dry fit......uh-oh.....Houston we have a problem....<br />The front flares were apparently cut wrong from the factory.  The edge that butts up against the Jeep's fender was cut straight, until it got towards the front of the fender, then it went out at a 15 degree angle, which created a 1/4 inch gap all the way to the front.  This was the same for both front flares.  I didn't bother dry fitting the rear flares, as it didn't matter at this point. Contacted Amazon about returning the product, and was informed that they did not have any more in stock, so I had to settle for a refund.<br />I can't blame Amazon for this, obviously. Thank you Amazon for the quick response and refund.  Luckily I had a UPS drop store close to my house, that was open on Saturday, so I could return the item.<br />Anyway, getting a refund, and I will have to order from elsewhere.......
B002P8DFHA|3|The mirror is ok. It vibrates a little at highway speeds. And you can't move the mirror as far down as the stock mirror if you want to see your rear tires of roading. It looks great, very close match to the factory one.
B00BI6ZJ1U|5|It was great! Matched my Granddaughter's car perfectly.
B000CODLZ0|5|Sounds great in my 2004 chevy silverado. Very happy with it!
B001G72RQ6|1|Two of the hangers/arms broke holding a 16lb rode bike.  Not a quality product.
B0022XKEG8|4|This helmet is well-made and a perfect fit. I love the unusual quilted cover as well. My only complaint is that it looks very bulbous, like the Great Gazoo from The Flintstones. In all fairness this is probably much more safe in a crash than the smaller &#34;brain bucket&#34;-type helmets, regardless of whether or not they are DOT-approved. I love the visor, the vents, and the neck cover. I just wish I were less self-conscious about the Gazoo factor...
B005HJ6M38|4|Looks cool with the carbon fiber and aluminum.  Looks better down not extended.  Reception us not as good as u hoped but I looks cool.
B000GTOSTE|5|charger cord
B00C0SNKOI|5|Great product.
B00FO5A55Q|3|Still having problems with the headlight. The right side adjuster won't hold or adjust so am having to pull it back out to see what's wrong.
B000AMBOI0|5|Looks just like the picture. Haven't used yet but will in the next month as getting ready for mowing season.
B006A2WLYA|5|awesome product!
B000BYD7B4|5|No problems, and after tune-up gas mileage went up.
B000JZKLN2|5|Highly Recommend! I am 28 and I Do IT work and don't know much about cars. Unlike alot of guys, my dad passed away before i was a teen so I never learned much about maintenance on your vehicle (ofcourse, we did have google/you tube). I say that to say, even I installed this with no problems in my 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt LS (2-dr) w/133,000 miles. Perfect fit and the power is amazing! You will notice the power get stronger and stronger the more you drive it after installation until it reaches its peak (takes about 2-4 weeks but the power increase is permanent ofcourse while its in there). I have a friend that installed one in his Trailblazer and he said the exact same thing. Now my car is faster, but super LOUD!!! Like LOUD LOUD! In between 2-4 gears around 2200rpm's, this thing roars at other cars. And when its not roaring, it sounds like your car is growling. Heads definitely turn and I know they are surprised when they see it was a cobalt making all that noise. The installation was simple. I watched the youtube video 3x until I had it down, put the part together first before heading to the car. Took about 35 mins to install, 10-15 mins to put it together. All i needed was a pair of scissors since the rubber tube was kinda long. Wish I could upload a picture, but I do not see any links for images. Worth every penny! Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND! You CAN install this by yourself, its cake.
B00LEBLI82|4|Fast shipping - product arrived as described.
B008LTPGOM|5|good afr meter.
B001A3DEMC|4|I've had so many MC rainsuits over the years and the general rule for me is that these breathable textile suits eventually start to wet out, and become useless in the rain.  You can try and recover their waterproof/hydrophobic nature, but it never seem to work well or for long.  I've resigned myself to the fact that I will get a new rain suit every couple years, and the rain jackets waterproof ability will wear out faster than the pants.<br /><br />This suit fits nice, is visible on the road, looks good, and is waterproof.  I expect it to last a couple years.  I also got a normal heavier rainsuit, not specific for MC at about half the price.  That works just as well, and I expect it to last a lot longer, but it's not as breathable and gets warmer when wearing it than this suit does.<br /><br />I've worm this suit in probably 6 decent days of rain for a 40-minute commute, and in every case arrives bone dry.  I do like the suspenders, as rain pants tend to run wide in the waist for me and this keeps them from bunching up (though, you look silly with the jacket off and these suspenders hiking your pants up).
B000F5JMEA|4|Good tool, got to have it to get the job done, highly recommend ,it's worth the money, fast shipping ,A+++ .
B00KTJ5JL2|5|Easy to program. Got it in time.
B000CPI5Z0|5|Seems to work, can't tell if its really doing anything but if I have no problems then it must be working. Lol
B000LY4DA8|5|The best helmet deal in the world. Nothing stands close to this kind of quality for this kind of money. Buy 4 Vox for the equivalent quality from another brand
B0076SO3VG|5|Fast shipping, super easy to apply.
B009T9MOXO|5|Adjustability!!  It bends in any direction and swivels 360 degress in 2 locations.  Works great on motorcycles for navigation  Great!!.
B001RO1K4S|1|Was disappointed that it turned out to be flimsy plastic and near-useless.  There are so many other options; make sure to read reviews and the fine print before you buy.
B00558WESS|3|Not as dark as pictured
B00HV2KNA2|3|Would give it more stars if it had better installation instructions, other than that parts are a good quality and fairly easy to install once you figure out were everything goes from the lack of instructions, but the price is a fair deal. And they did offer a hotline number to call if you have issues.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Great product i hit a deer at 55mph and the deer hit two of the lights dead on and they both srill work just bent the mounting bracket so if you want some tough lights buy these they will take a hit from a deer at 55 and still work.
B00563RFJU|2|The remote seems to only work when it wants to. Cant expect much for the price though. It worked fine the first couple of days.
B002P309N8|2|very disappointed in the content. If you have some experience in panel replacement you probably won't learn any thing new from this and since it abruptly ends before the repair is completed it leaves the purchaser hanging and needing to purchase the next episode.. dave
B001U7SR3E|4|These lights fit my 1999 F150 perfectly and were an economical way to replace the original headlights that were yellowed and hazy.  The lights came with bulbs and were easy to install.  I did measure the adjusters on the original headlights and transferred those measurements over to the new lights.  However, I still needed to re-aim the lights after they were installed.  The Lisle 14540 Headlight Adjusting Rachet did not work very well on my truck.  I could only adjust two out of the four adjusters with that tool.  If you have a 1999 era F150, look for a different adjusting tool.
B000C846Y6|4|awesome, works well and it locks. It is a bit hard to lock and unlock sometimes, the key bend out of shape a little, but if you are careful, it can be done every time.
B005A04PEW|5|I got this engine faster that told and it works fantastic few thong I would do though if your using it for a project get a muffleraje sure to put the gas in the spot with the white switch and tighten all bolts they come loose somtimes
B0088P06AS|5|Very happy with product and purchase
B00319UNO0|5|I have circulatory problems, and until now, haven't found a good solution to them.  I have tried heating pads before, but none of them compare to this!  I decided to try sleeping on it (shoulders to mid-thigh) from one of the reviews posted, and I have never woke up feeling better.  It worked so well, I am looking into get more, and definitely one for my mom.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works AMAZING!!!!  Have no reservations about buying this product!! Perfect for reading and clearing codes.  It monitors certain timing and levels of the vehicle also.  Oh, and you if you click on the code it will tell you what exactly it is :)
B005ZGSCYA|5|Not much else to say. Does what it says it will do. Have yet to come across anything better. Doesn't mean it's not out there but until I find it, I'm satisfied with this.
B00ES5Q7KA|3|But that's my fault, I had two 16&#34; blades in my Cart and I think I deleted the wrong one, I was supposed to purchase the 16&#34; passenger wiper, oh well.
B000FQ7976|5|not the problem of the assembly but I had to replace the entire pump
B004I0YOVY|4|This was a drop-in replacement but didnt have quite teh same fit with the trim as the (briken)OEM light I removed
B0073WDPEQ|2|Nice product, but I had to force the thread. The pitch looked right, really had to force it on though.
B005LGTSIS|3|I replaced both sliding door harnesses on a 2005 T&C Limited with the Dorman aftermarket parts. The quality of the body clips supplied with the harnesses are inferior. All the clips broke upon installation (too brittle). Be prepared to either use the existing clips or fabricate new ones. I hope the quality of the wire is better. Both harnesses were replaced within a couple months of each other. I had repaired the old harnesses a couple of times each but I had a problem finding machine wire flexible enough to take the everyday wear & tear and the links finally wore out. I'll replace with OEM if they fail within 18 months. It takes less than a half hour to replace each harness (if you have the clips and wire ties). I'll repost when they fail or I retire the car. 12/11.<br /><br />Replaced Driver's door with Mopar after 6 mos.  (I use the doors a lot)-The wires had fatigued. Passenger side's ready to go. I have found that the machine wire quality varies significantly between the harness mfg's.<br />Good Luck!
B001DRH4IK|1|wrong belt ! not worth sending back!
B001H494DC|5|This chock is great.  I had a problem with kids kicking out he chocks from my trailer.  This completely stopped that from happening.  It also makes it hard for someone to try to steal my trailer.  Well built!!!
B00466V9AY|5|looks and works like original. easy to program can't believe the low cost. i only use this set of keys as a backup so can't say much about reliability.
B0064SGRPE|5|Looks great on my jeep and was easy to install
B007WMBGZ2|5|First class, supper high quality.
B00GUF74HQ|5|30 minute install. Works great
B000COBUWQ|1|When it came time to use K-D air hold tool I could not because I needed an adapter.  The plug treads in my Chevy L6 head were deep in the plug hole.  If I had thread at the opening of plug hole I could of used the air hose tool.<br /><br />There are two problems here : 1st,  I did not do my home work, and 2nd, Amazon.com did not address the need for adapters which I wish they had.  I can only give it one star because I did not use the air hose tool.
B00MYKDDG2|5|I gifted this product to a friend of mine and it works wonderfully for them .!... With good health and safety.!
B0070Y36N2|1|Horrible! Cheap carbon fiber that wouldn't even fit my license plate. Then they wouldn't accept my return.
B00QK2WYN8|1|picture in not what you get and look like toy ligth
B00KVLYJ50|5|We saved a lot of money and works great! :)
B008ESK7E4|5|good quality clear lenses, decent projector fog assembly (seems better than OEM)<br />used to replace faded and pitted OEM housings.
B008FCCPU8|5|This is exactly what I needed fit perfect and helps me organize on the big open space of the center console
B00AL6SINO|2|Cool but it isn´t water resistant. Not very useful.
B00LTG04G4|5|Item was as described and delivered on time
B000AMPIXM|1|Although it was quality built, I did not like the looks of it once it was on my SUV. It stuck out too far and it just looks like a boat propellor from far away. :(
B005R3SSMW|5|This is the only filter wrench you need to change the oil filter on a Toyota or Lexus. This PBT71110 also fits the 6 and 8 cylinder engines so learn from my experience and save your money. I also purchased the the bigger version, for the 8 cylinder, to find out this one fits them all.
B000CF8W08|5|Easy to install and works great and fits well
B00I8IPCM2|5|Fits my 2014 Ford Fusion great. Slid right in and was relatively easy to do. It took about 30 minutes.
B0001EFSTI|5|:)
B00E9ICB42|5|I purchased these for my daughters car. She loves them. She thinks they was her favorite gift this past Christmas.
B0016ZWVEQ|1|This cable is not approved for use with the CarDAQ2534 by Drew Tech.  It has not been evaluated by Drew Technologies, Inc. and should not be considered a replacement for the original cable.
B001KVW6EQ|5|Great!
B001Q399RA|2|I bought this winch to pull my #3000 race car on my trailer. As mentioned in some other posts, the winch pulls slow but it did pull my car onto the trailer. After we unloaded the car, I went to let some of the cable back out and it would not unwind. You could hear the rely clicking but the motor would not work. The motor was cool but thought maybe I'll try in a few minutes. Still nothing.<br />Contacted Superwinch, it's been two weeks and still waiting to hear back from them.
B0009V1WXE|4|Good quantity for the price!
B006TMLX0E|5|Excellent quality, exact fit & best pricing.  IMPORTANT:  This Unit maintains OEM headlight adjustment capability utilizing OEM dashboard control - focusing assy, connection & motor included - I understand some aftermarket products do not include this feature - I found no shortcomings with this product & recommend utilizing this supplier in the future.
B000CB97CY|5|This was really a great product and was as advertised. I had a very fast and easy installation and afterwards I found Rancho shocks to deliver a smooth ride.
B000E28KV0|3|Didn't really see much increase in HP or MPG on my F150.  Engine sound (throttle body sucking air) is louder, if that's what you want.
B00FSC457E|4|Great price, but I wish it would have come with a gasket
B000VB66SS|5|great quality and I always recommend Spectra products,  extremely satisfied with them.
B000H2DLMA|5|Everything came in in great time and was packaged very well. The price on it was great also. Just as listed. Much brighter then the orange toned ones we replaced them for.
B007TG7HVS|5|Easy to install - locks on nicely, compared to some of the other name brands.  They look good from the inside of the vehicle (though that's not a real important criteria).  Haven't had a lot of rain yet to see them in action, but they have done a nice job on the snow.
B00KOSZIH8|4|very well built helmet, I bought a large. would suggest getting the tinted shields though otherwise it looks funny. I sold my bike and mine is for sale so if you would like to buy it I can ship it from Lancaster Ohio where I live. just email me at nickschooley96@yahoo.com. ill sell it for $80 plus shipping cost. it shouldn't be over $90 and it will ship faster because these come from Hong Kong China and take about 2 weeks to get to you
B0036E9VB6|3|Does not work for racing bike tires. I still use it for the motorbikes. An adapter in the box would be nice. At least an separate offer could help.
B007Y85646|5|Purchased for a friend. Worked fine on 2000 ford contour. Very heavy compared to the one we took off. Got it fast and great service! Thanks DB electrical !!
B0007A0EUO|5|AWESOME product. Very easy to install, package comes with easy to follow instructions that can also be viewed on their website. Makes a nice whistle sound when I mash the throttle. Not 100% sure if the fuel mileage increased, but the horsepower seems to be better. Installed a K&N cold air intake next day and for sure had some extra horsepower and still has that whistle sound.
B00J5QEK3S|5|I think they're great they do exactly what I needed and the price was good
B005RNEH5O|5|I never heard of silicone paste until 2 months ago.  Oh sure I have been aware of silicone spray for years and have used it.  However silicone paste is great for automotive purposes, particularly window regulator and window channel problems.  I have a rear side window on my Dodge Dakota 4 door truck that would &#34;jump&#34; as it went down, going up was fine.  I tried silicone spray many times to get it to move smoothly on the way down to no avail, plus there is not a lot of adjustment to these window regulators.  Going up was fine.  Then I saw a video on YouTube by Eric the Car Guy and he used silicone paste on a window channel install.  He said silicone paste was good stuff for installing window channels and can solve a whole host of car window problems.  I used the paste on my Dakota rear side window and the problem was solved.  Soon after that I had to install a new window regulator in a Honda Accord and I put some silicone paste in the window channels and I think on some regulator parts.  Anyway it worked good too and still does.  It doesn't take a lot of paste to get good results so don't slop it on like you are making a peanut butter & jelly sandwich.  Just use common sense when applying it.
B00842A7F4|4|The fasteners worked fine on my '02 CR-V.  Even auto accessory stores wanted five times the price of these things.  I would have given them 5 stars but they were simple little plastic thingies just doing what they were designed to do.  If you've got 10 mm holes that need filled to hold something on to your vehicle, these will do it.
B006VC8UI0|5|Fits perfectly fine on my 2001 BMW 325i. Love it!
B000GF22FA|5|Great fit, easy to put on! Looks so much better! And will protect the bumper paint from scratches . . .
B0052YQMLA|5|The product works well and synced up right away to my phone which I use as my Ipod as well. Speakers are nice and thin so no pressure on my ears. Would recommend!
B001BBVIX0|5|I have  a 2000 740il, the Tail Lights are gorgious they update my car instantly, I highly recommend this product. Easy to install as well.
B006WQRBKI|5|Excellent quality part.
B000RN4FK6|5|Great bags for the price takes a little finagling to get on but work great!
B002RKH6NK|5|This is just what we were looking for. Great price and is just what my daughter wanted for her birthday!
B0074OHCOC|4|This is the second one I purchased.  The first one lasted 9 months before the bonnet became unusable.  It stretched out from use and cleaning.  Finding a replacement bonnet was challenging and it was 'easier' to purchase a new set.<br /><br />Now the good - The reach is great for a standard sized windshield and the length of the handle ensures the user can apply proper pressure to all areas of the windshield.
B00J8R5NU8|3|I prefer American made products !!!
B0030VH6M6|5|Bought these to hold up the replacement skid plate holding the gas tank on a 97 wrangler. They worked without modification.
B00965DFQ6|5|These are great premium filters. Delivery was very quick.
B001X30KMG|1|If you like your microfiber thin as a paper towel & snagging itself into a paint rag this one is 4 you!!
B004A6NB1U|5|Better than the ones you buy in auto parts store at the same price and better performance. A Great value!
B001KS86E8|5|Excellent. I was looking for it for months than I bought something like that but in wain. The part is excellent. I reccommended it to my relative who also had the same model of the car. Thanks a lot
B001J9ROPK|5|Replaced some aftermarket mats I purchased when I first purchased my E46.. Mats came with hooks and are a breath of fresh air!  Excellent Quality Fast service..  I will be purchasing the rear mats soon!
B000C5CESO|5|Worked really well till i lost it and had to buy another one haha
B000CD579E|4|They do what they are supposed to and shipping was fast.
B0010DZZPG|5|Fits perfectly.
B00LV8PAPU|5|I absolutely love this jacket. Heavy duty leather, classic style and I've got some heads to turn while wearing it. I'd totally recommend it for the price!
B009EWLU5Y|5|Works great
B001GJ3FIS|4|Pretty sturdy and solid materials and fabrication.  My only caution would be to not drop it too much on concrete surfaces.  Plastic scuffs easily and it would probably break after enough drops.
B00JEUHPMI|5|Nice! Easy to install but needs updated harness to make it look cleaner above the hood.Worth the money.
B00NEL6HT0|5|Can't beat the price for what you get
B000CITK8S|2|I thought this unit would be great for my motorcycle but after three days it stopped working. Probably just a bad one. Sent it back and ordered the full size model which I've never had trouble with.
B0009IQZH0|5|Very satisfied with this purchase
B007EXMYIC|5|Nice n cheap
B0075EJ81G|5|For my 2007 Bmw x 5 2007 fit very good no problem thank you guys you do good job thanks again
B000VYBLJ4|5|I got this set about a year ago when it was on sale through Amazons Lightning Deals and have been very pleased with them.    Just last week I replaced my Fiesta's speakers and used a few of the different tools to pop all the door panels off.  Worked very well.    Big step up from trying to wrap a screwdriver with tape to protect your paint.
B00AMNJBXW|4|Is this product sold in pair?<br />[[ASIN:B00AMNJBXW Dura International BR55125 Rear Solid Disc Brake Rotor]]
B000E4QOWA|5|Shipped fast. Fits the car. Good price. what else matters with a product like this?
B0002UQATS|5|great product
B008HA80GQ|5|A little smaller than expected but I'm happy with it.
B001OBI5JC|1|completely covered in rust after 2 weeks on vehicle.
B00KTITCRU|4|2001 Ford F-150.  After about 10 attempts at programming based on the instructions I finally went to the Internet and found a youtube.  My problem was that I was not cycling fast enough.  For my vehicle go from off to run 8 times in 10 seconds.  More like 5 seconds, I mean do it as fast as you can and the truck entered the programming cycle.  Then I just pushed the lock button on the remote and then turned the key to off and it was programmed.  However, if you already have a remote you will need to push its lock button right after you push the new one, or another words all remotes have to be programmed at the same time.  During my initial test I could go back at least 30 feet and it was still working.
B006SYNF9K|4|It looks very pretty and it really works to keep the front seats cooler, but too large for my Toyota Matrix.
B009TB5006|5|As described
B00157TGXY|5|As advertised
B00ANA3UTK|5|I saw the reviews and wanted to try it out myself and I was not disappointed. It really works, I like it because it take out the sticky and the greasy stains and reeves the smells that are left behind and its orderless so no cheesy cleaner smell
B0083P3W1S|3|Some wires was loose inside and made contact with each other in the light housing in which blew several fuses and darken the inside of the lamp.
B0036ULEV0|2|I purchased this inflator to use with my floor compressor.  I recently bought a new RV and having proper tire inflation on my trailer is very important.  The gauge is not accurate when I compare it to two other gauges (Accu-Gage EZ Air Check) that I have had for years. I bought this gauge based on reviews I saw on Amazon.
B009WS4Z5C|5|My son told me about this stuff and gave me some to use on my car.  I was amazed how easy it was and what a beautiful shine I got.  When I got home I ordered some of my own from Amazon.  My next job was our motorhome.  It did an awesome job.  I have never found anything like this.  Even after 6 months of it still looks really good and dirt and grime just come off easy.  I let my neighbor try it on her SUV and she was able to do her whole car in a tenth of the time it took her husband with another product and her car had a much nicer finish.  Awesome product.
B001CF3IZ6|4|FOr the money this is a great option.  it cost much less than many other consoles and does the job.  well built and sturdy.  mounted easily in my Yj.  this in addition to new seats has made the front a bit more cramped
B000ETQMIQ|2|super small. I'd say you could fit two large Wendy's drink cups in there and that would be it. For a family going on a long car ride, this isn't going to last for more than a few hours :(. We sent it back.
B000VKTUM8|4|The set I got went in a little tightly.  once I had the first filter in I had to play with the second one a little to get it to fit, but I finally succeeded.  I had bought a different brand before that fit slightly better, but can't remember the brand.<br />In the end these are working just fine.
B003POL69C|1|Have bought a lot of Griot's products and been very satisfied - this was an exception!  Not that I believe you should have to pay for a sprayer to apply their products, BUT if you are going to charge, at least make it a reliable, quality product.  The last bottle of Spray-n-Shine outlived the sprayer so I transferred it into an empty bottle from another manufacturer.  Save your money.
B001DCF6JE|5|This is a quality strut support and provides more than adequate damped lift. Priced considerably less than factory replacements also.
B00112UU24|5|excellent product. Armor All does it again
B009DIYMSG|5|Thanks
B004YA0YD0|5|I'm pleased with these tire valve caps.  They look good & seem to be of durable quality.  I like that you can use the wrench to tighten them just enough that someone won't just twist them off by hand.  The only negative (if you can call it that) is that you have to be careful threading them onto the stem because the metal is less forgiving than the cheap plastic caps that come with some tires.
B00318JTCS|4|OVERALL VERY GOOD QUALITY KIT. ONLY ISSUE IVE HAD IS THE CHEAP SWITCH. LIGHTS WORK GREAT AND INSTALL IS A BREEZE.
B0019R7GUA|2|I bought these for use on a motorcycle half helmet.  They look really nice prior to application, nice design and coloring.  However, once applied the sticker didn't hold up well.  All the corners are beginning to come up and curl at the edges.
B001NYJOE0|5|Great Price and great quality, this kit came with everything I needed to do my own timing belt and water pump change (sans regular mechanic tools of course) and decent instructions though I did have do do a little bit of youtubing to make sure all the timing marks lined up to the correct notch on the under-drive pulley.<br />Otherwise it fit tightly and the tensioner worked great until the valves finally dropped from the damage done when the original timing belt broke and I'm sure the valves slapped the pistons (but I still got another 5k miles out of a 260k+ mile 1991 B18A1)  I will buy this brand again.
B00ADX5W0W|5|This product fits exactly like OEM.  The brake shoes look like the same quality as the OEM product it replaced.
B006G0MKPG|5|Great Product. Fast shipment.
B00C0UA3HS|5|same quality as oem<br />fits 1997 lexus es 300<br />very cheap compared to toyota genuine<br />I would recommend to everyone looking for unmatched prices and superior quality
B000TCCWS2|4|I would not rate this excellent as the visibility isn't super clear, and because it is certainly no replacement for a back-up camera. There is some glare and reflection, and the view isn't terribly clear. But, overall, it does provide a bit more coverage. You can see a moving kid about 2-3 feet behind you, rather than the 15 feet w/out it.  I purchased the 8&#34; x 10&#34;, and cut off the top 1/3 of it. The very bottom had a lot of glare- you couldn't see anything out of this part, so I also cut off the bottom 1/6th of it. What was left was the most useful viewable area for my car (2013 Subaru Outback). I would recommend installing it at full size, and trying some different placements to see where you get the best visibility, then trim only as needed. I didn't want to hinder my regular visibility, and ended up placing mine at the top center of the rear window. I also wasn't particularly interested in seeing extra wide-angle sky- so that is why I cut off the top portion (approx top 1/3rd). I haven't had this product long enough to rate how long it stays attached, but even if it falls off, it is super easy to stick it back on with more water. Overall, I still recommend it.
B0014H7LL4|5|Typical key fob with Ford logo.  I keep my truck keys on it, it works.  If you like Ford accessories you'll like this.
B004W97DC8|5|These are a great replacement or step up from the standard tail lights. They work well and look cool as well. Easy to install yourself,save some money!The old ones come out easily and these pop right in.
B0068ODC1Q|1|The price was right, but did not work, would not program. Ended up using the new contacts on my old electronics.
B007XVHAAW|4|The item helped me control the mess that was building up on the undercarriage.
B004X70LZA|5|I put a small hole in the tip and I couldn't ask for a better grease. It was a good price for such a large quantity.
B00ALOWEAO|3|Tailight body was slightly warped, resulting in a gap larger at the top where the peg fits into the fender hole. Otherwise, it was fine.<br /><br />John
B006HYAASA|3|This bumper is one of the best looking bumpers in this price range, HOWEVER!!!!  Does not include the D-Rings in the picture and PLEASE read the following.  I installed the winch mount portion of the bumper which the rest of the bumper attaches to.  Not really thinking about alignment.  Once I installed the bumper portion to the winch mount is was off center by almost a half inch.  So I'm thinking I messed up and disassembled the entire thing.  Come to find out the welds on the winch mount were so large that where they connect to Toyota bumper mount, when you run down the factory wide flange nut it forces the winch mount to move to the passenger side.  I had to remove the winch mount and grind down the welds (not too happy about that) so that the flange nuts would seat correctly and not cause the winch mount to move to the passenger side.  Once all this was accomplished the mount centered up on the truck and the bumper centered up on the mount.  SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GRIND ON A BRAND NEW $1299 BUMPER.  All-in-all still a nice bumper and very tough looking.  Nice lights (PIAA brand) included and overall very well made.  MAKE SURE you mark your center on the truck and center the winch mount on that mark.  The other bumpers that are this nice looking are in the $2000 range so it's still a good deal, just be aware that it's not perfect.
B000C11PYW|5|Works great--used on SUV with tire pressure sensor and no issues months later.<br />Tire still holds air and TPM works fine.
B000NKCQQS|5|They provided the finishing touch to my restored '89 325i cabrio. Look good, were easy to apply, and I believe they will not fall off the wheels easily under regular washing. Recommended!
B00O0SRA74|4|The lights are ok, small, BUT I know that going in.  The control BOX SUCKS...  by changing the save pattern to last and allowing for a power on with the last saved pattern would be great.  They go good in the back window of a Ford Crown Vic with just a little velcro so the holes do NOT have to be cut in the liner which makes my department HAPPY...<br />ALL of the lights worked great out of the box, and it has three pattern selections, just my statement above and I would be happy.  Great price, fairly bright, NOT Whelen's, BUT, NOT a WHELEN Price....
B000QX52CM|5|This kit includes a bug & tar remover, terry cloth applicator pads for waxing & removing waxes, a mit for washing. Very easy to use all these products.
B00KF9180W|5|Great product!  Very versatile, light weight and comfortable.  Does a good job!
B003UZ271C|4|Good solid atachment.  For my part, I will probably weld a few tacks where the hitch bolts to the ATV.  No matter how hard I cranked on the bolt and nut attaching the hitch (including using a 2 foot breaker bar), the hitch still shifted when I used the blade that I was pulling behind the ATV.  Probably a bit of overkill, but I have all the attachments that I need for the hitch and don't see any reason why I would need to remove it.
B00E0FQ6KE|4|Only one of them had all the diodes working. But since I only needed one, I just threw away the other.
B001LHVOVK|5|I was pleased a $40 auto scan tool did exactly what it said it would. Worked flawlessly! Great tool for the money. Would highly reccommend!
B005C4MHZK|5|This is a great brace that's easy to use, adjust, and allows a complete range of motion. Very comfortable and solidly made.
B0076CBAGI|4|thanx
B0034TOGEA|5|Perfect for emergency money, key and other stuff.
B00EHLACUQ|5|These are perfect! They fit my 2012 Jetta tire bolts, but only the non-locking bolts. I had to order the special locking bolt covers separately.
B0007LXTMS|4|just ok
B000LDIJ72|4|Just what I needed.
B002WT4B98|5|Quick turn-around and good quality product.  Exactly what I wanted; thank you!
B001TKWRHO|5|good tool for implementation and uniformity of the product layer
B00GHT6SF4|5|Just received.....removed old one....installed new one in about 15 minutes.  Great replacement.  Almost as good as OEM.  Just hope it lasts longer then OEM.  As long as this last longer then 18 months like my new one.... I will buy this again. Lid is very close to OEM color to.
B000CMH4AU|3|The deep fitting is scaring the mechanics, when I have the charger in service, they keep thinking something is wro ng.
B000V0M8TA|5|Worked great!  Just like the one I removed.
B0040Z9C32|5|Well made. Nice fit. Made of quality material and adhesive is top notch. Would recommend.
B000LG8GI6|1|Piece of junk. Followed the instructions to the \\"T\\" at least 30 times and it still did not work. Waste of my money and time. Piece of s***.
B003XGYDE2|5|When I first used this inflator, the curled hose leaked at the tire connector end, but inflated bike tires anyway.  I called the Bel-Aire (the distributor) 800 number, spoke with a live person, explained my problem and, two days later, I had a new hose.  Easy as that.  The replacement hose works fine and this inflator works well on bike tires and wheelbarrow tires.  Even worked on our car tires, although it takes a bit longer, but not objectionably so, given the tiny size of this machine.  The construction seems sturdy after having it about a month.  It is also reasonably quiet.  Overall, this just seems like a much better idea than the $40-$50 manual tire pumps that REI and bike stores sell.
B00LOYCIXI|5|Perfect fit and function
B0002TDUW4|5|I bought this actually to coat a flood table for my CNC router. I was originally going to use marine paint but I thought this would last longer and I am glad I did. It is incredibly thick and I used less the 1 gallon to cover the 4'x4' table with 2 coats. I imagine this will be amazing on pickup beds as it is intended.
B000C2WD7Y|5|Every gate hose I got from Amazon was perfect sized, great quality. Cant say the same about Dayco from autozone or pepboys.<br />Gate every time!
B000ALG062|5|Excellent product and a good price.  Anywhere you go these cost an arm and a leg, and trying to match them up in the auto parts store is ludicrous.  These were easy to buy online, two day shipping, and a tw minute install each side.  Pop the hood release and the hood now comes up on it's own!  Nice OEM replacement.
B00445L290|5|Bought this vac as a Christmas gift for my son and his wife but after receiving it and seeing how nice it is, my husband wants one too!!
B00B9P4ABA|5|These are good stickers and my son enjoyed them. Thank you for offering a good product at a decent price
B000R9ASEW|5|Finally an item to protect our outside rear view mirrors From the wall. Super easy to install.<br />Wonderful look on the walls<br />Pl
B000XG8Q0W|1|I tried to use it for about 6 months.  The concept is wonderful, but since it doesn't contour to the back of the seat (and it's too hard to bend to fit) all it did was bounce up and down and back and forth and make this annoying metal-on-metal noise while scraping against the headrest post at the top.  I threw it out.
B00FGV260U|5|Tangerine Orange perfect on my Subaru Crossteck. One larger spot on my bumper and a large door ding needed multiple coats, but are largely invisible unless you are really looking for the spots. So far the paint has stood up to the weather, I will reedit if touch up paint does not hold up in the future.
B002WIFJL8|5|Purchase as a gift for friend. She has it on her car and her friends as where she got it.
B0010E3JUI|4|I bought this from Amazon for about $15 less than the version sold by the Honda dealer (not including the $40 installation charge for 10 minutes of work).  Delivery time was 5 days with free shipping.  The item arrived in original Fram packaging in perfect condition.<br /><br />Installation took about 10 minutes, although at least half of that was spent warming my frozen fingers.  The filters (note there are two filters in the package) fit perfectly into the frames.  Each filter is clearly labeled with respect to airflow direction, which is a nice touch.  Airflow is fine and there is no noticeable smell from the &#34;FreshBreeze&#34; baking soda.<br /><br />In summary, the product seems high quality and was very fairly priced.  I will definitely purchase again when I need new cabin filters.
B003QNF95O|5|Great item, we love it! Easy to install and good quality. Would purchase again. Was exactly as described in listing.
B000VKTUJQ|4|Not much to say.  It is a good alternative to over priced OEM filter.
B000BZIEE8|5|I put a cheap fuel pump in the car (05 passat)  and it lasted for about 6 months and it always had a hard time starting even with a new fuel filter.  Well the cheap pump died so i decided to try this pump.  the fit is better and the car starts everytime like it did when it was new.
B0012AWSHK|1|You must have the factory or dealer installed towing package for this part to work. Nowhere in the description of this part does it tell you that. Plus it took almost 8 weeks to ship. I'd return it but got it dirty trying to get it to work.  See [...] for a Nissan kit.
B000BZJ9Q0|5|A+
B00DGVX3YK|5|Really like these blades: quieter than the original mercedes blade.  Easy enough to install with 8 in 1 adapter.  DO look at the online video on the Rain-X web site to be sure you are installing it correctly.<br /><br />Put this on my ML350 after Pep Boys installed one of this brand on my E500 when I asked them to change the wipers while they were doing a state inspection.  It was such an improvement over what the dealer had been using that I bought them for the ML as well.  This is the driver-side blade in my year.  It moves quietly and does a great job of squeeging the window.<br /><br />They have a helpful guide to sizes on the Rain-X web site.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Great product love it!!
B007P05FBW|1|The piston came in with a stripped thread for the hinge attachment. Called the manufacture and will see if they send out a new one, as promised. If not. Amazon will get the call then MasterCard cancellation.
B001DU91ZQ|5|Great OEM part for the price. It's amazing how much of an improvement it was in driving once I replace my worn 110k originals. You don't notice how bad the ride is since it wears over time. I used these on my 2006 GMC Envoy XL Denali 4wd.
B00D1ASSY6|2|I got 4 strips of leds as promised, but all of them had leds that didn't light, so all of them were useless to me.
B00JIIZCM6|5|Excellent product, works very well, light pleasant smell
B001KKDG4G|5|Great item. Just like the picture. Got it as a stocking stuffer for someone who needs their hands free so the lanyard can hold the remote for the helicopter. Would recommend company.
B00AQ2G4Q6|5|Perfect fit
B0067ECS6W|5|what can you say about an oil filter? haha. It fit, and does the job. cant really vouch for performance critique as i am not qualified to do so but i DO believe that K&N has their products manufactured for performance!
B002HQTOU2|2|I've been detailing and cleaning my vehicles for the past 15 years. So I'm rather particular about what I use and how I clean the vehicles. Which is why I used this on a friends vehicle  (with their permission) who doesn't particularly care about how it looks. :)     First of all, you should NEVER use any product like this on a dirty vehicle without washing it first. Otherwise you are simply rubbing dirt directly into the paint and you will have swirl marks. Especially if you have a dark colored vehicle. The vehicle should idealy be washed with pressure washer to remove large/loose dirt (or reputable touchless wash if not available), and then with a wash mit and bucket (with grit guard) using car wash soap. If it's in the kitchen, don't use it. Car wash soap only please.     Once you have a 99% clean vehicle, you may then proceed to use the Lucky Earth detailing kit. You can use this to clean up any spots you may have missed on the paint, wheels, or even glass if you feel like it. For this, the product got the job done. But then again, so does plain old H2O with a microfiber towel. Perhaps if you don't have clean water available, this would work. But then again, how did you wash the vehicle in the first place?      Compared to the normal detailing products I have and currently do use such as Meguiars and Zaino... well, there is no comparison. These products do a far better job as cleaning, adding shine, protection, and even helping cover up swirls.     The tire kit provides a matte finish (ie. not shiny). I'm not really sure if added any protection since it looks and feels the same as it did after it was washed with soap and water. But it did pick up more dirt. Once again, it's a tire. Water/Towel would do the same thing. We won't bother comparing this to anything else.     Then you have to consider the cost. This is somewhat pricey for a detailing kit. But I suppose that's the price you pay for earth-friendly products.     Pros:   * Earth-friendly.  * Very nice towels  * Removes water spots like you've never seen before  * Did I mention the soft microfiber towels?    Cons:   * Expensive  * Potentially costly and harmful washing directions  * \\"Non-earth friendly\\" products do much better.     Overall, I like trees too. But the Lucky Earth product only cleans stuff slightly better than water. And not how they claim it should. There is no way you are ditching traditional washing methods for a spray bottle on a dirty vehicle.      My suggestion: If you need a detailing kit, buy well known products such as Meguiars and use them on cars only. Not trees. They are definitely car-friendly.
B00FLFX1QO|5|Bought these bushings because the original ones in my car were making the radiator rock. Easy install, and happy with the product.
B003ZWG6T4|5|This makes my life easier everyday. It was on my door step in 36 hours after I placed my order.
B009WDYH0U|5|I bought two of them one for my mom's leather vest and the other for my 10 year old son's leather vest. It fit perfect.  It took me a while to iron them on the vests, then I sewed them because or else they would come off. They look really nice.  We get lots of great complements from people.  The vests look similar to Darl's Vest (from the Walking Dead), which it's what my son wanted.
B000BQRG00|4|Good gauge easy to use and easy to read the dial.
B007ZDDUCK|5|It softened and brought back life to my jacket.  My jacket has never been softer before.  I gives the leather a natural gloss. Easy as hell to use.
B000CITK8S|5|My bike has always started after being garaged for the winter, except for this year. Charged overnight and it started the next morning. Also comes with a harness you can hook up to the battery permanently so you can just directly plug in the charger or other accessories. On my bike, the seat has to  be removed to get to the battery, so I appreciate the harness.
B004KL0I9I|5|Purchased this product as a replacement for the smaller blue one also sold on amazon.  That one did not read my ECU for my 2005 Chevy.  This product worked perfectly the first time I plugged it in.  Great value for the price
B000C9JTOW|5|was just what i needed for my car,as far as i can tell works great,would buy again if i needed the part
B00563MFH2|5|Super easy to program, and well worth the price.
B007OWGA4C|5|A++
B001JK1A4K|4|It wotks great but unless you plug in to light socket it stays on for ever and can't figure out how to turn it off .this was fixed by plugging it in place of one of the lights in the garage opener.otherwise laser is nice and bright and works great. I bought a second one for my vacation home too.
B00A9ZXY9K|4|Fits nicely, color is a good match, arrived quickly, but is a little pricey. Let it warm up to gain the correct shape.
B000KFSLWY|5|I was amazed how these fit.  They are very similar to the original mats, but slightly heavier.  I am very pleased with these and intend to buy a set for my other Passat.
B000MKEM52|4|Fit is a wee bit short, which is troubling since it will only shrink with time.
B001TZORJK|5|Oem brakes for my 2007 Ford Edge for less then cheap aftermarket brakes. Pair with oem rotors [[ASIN:B001CAB8EY Motorcraft BRR152 Brake Rotor]] and your car will be running like brand new!
B000ZG1GKC|3|I put this on the rear windshield of my brand new car three weeks ago. The red is already fading to a kind of antique look. Guess it isn't much of a match for the Texas summer sun. Still, helps my young kids zero in on the new car instantly, and I had to laugh at the friend that dubbed it my car's \\"tramp stamp\\" or the other friend that now refers to Lola (my car) as \\"The Car with the Dragon Tattoo\\"<br />The \\"Lethal Threat\\" words are cut separate from the dragon and can just be left on the sheet and tossed. Their is a clear border around the edges, but this was easy breezy to apply with no bubbles whatsoever, and when his foot stuck in the wrong place, easy to peel off gently and reposition. He has lasted through six automatic car washes (black cars + rain + no garage = lots of washing), a rear windshield wiper, sun, and rain, with not a single bit peeled up.<br />I hold a volunteer position that requires I meet up with a lot of people in public places, and it's nice to have a car identifier I can give them that isn't from walmart--makes me easy to find and unique. I'll probably just replace it once or twice a year when it fades too much.
B000S0ETRM|4|Good little intercooler.. only problem was. I expected it 2 be a little louder. But. Worth the money.  I definetely recommend
B002GOEK1I|1|I purchased this item and the first unit I received gave me every thing except running lights. I called curt mfg and they sent me a new unit that had power going to the black box but not out to my trailer. I called again and they told me I would be sent a HEAVY DUTY unit, and if that did not work I would be sent to a local repair shop for warranty.  Well the THIRD unit did not work either, I was sent to a Local shop and after Two hours of waiting around I was advised that they could not get my unit to work and was going to get ahold of company. After Three hours now I am being told by the manager of this company that the third unit was not the heavy duty unit since it was still sitting on the work bench. I was sent away with no resolution to my problem and after calling curt twice more I still can not get the lights to work so I can get my trailer Inspected. Bottom line NOT A GOOD PRODUCT AND VERY VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I AM NOW GOING TO TRY AND GET MY MONEY BACK SINCE I HAVE NOT GOTTEN WHAT I PAID FOR. PROBABLY MORE POOR RESULTS IF WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED SO FAR is any indication of how this company operates, BUT I WILL KEEP A OPEN MIND TILL I KNOW FOR SURE.
B0030594Y0|5|Great.
B0036E81OY|5|Just finished my install (VERY easy) and took my '10 RS/SS for a spin.  The increase in 'sound' is appreciated -- it bellows more like a muscle car should now when I punch it...but is still civil when I baby her.  The HP/torque increase is noticable.  As another reviewer noted, 'next step, exhaust upgrade'!  GREAT price -- thank you Amazon and K&N!!!
B0002NIGWY|4|I ordered these for a car that I ended up totaling a week later. Do I consider them bad luck? Maybe. Were they a quality product? You bet!
B00KTHXRLS|5|Product arrived timely, and worked effortlessly!
B00EZEC32A|5|Did what I needed them to do. Felt well made. Connectors clicked and fit in the sockets very well. Thanks
B00SB9QYKC|4|No complaints so far.
B004I1B86W|5|Great part. Matched perfectly.
B00G186POK|4|Great set of bulbs for a great price. I installed these in the map and dome lights in my 2009 Accord coupe, and they fit perfectly and function very well. They measure 34mm or 1-3/8\\". They shine a crisp bright white, no blue tint. As far as brightness compared to stock, I'd say they are about the same. One important feature is that they slowly dim when I close the car door, like the incandescents did. Overall I am very pleased, although I can't speak to their longevity as it's only been a few days.
B00G2U0LHY|1|All four bulbs I had ordered burned out in less than 2 days of use for each.
B006VGI47I|4|The price compared to the factory-brand roof rack speaks for itself. The bars surely do the job for my longboard. That having been said, it's worth noting that if your Touareg has a full sunroof, you cannot open the sunroof while the bars are installed. This is too bad...especially since the design is probably millimeters off from making this possible.
B00130G3PW|5|It's hard to type 20 words about an air filter, especially an OEM air filter.  But I will explain why I gave this filter 5 stars.  4 stars would be too low.  3 stars would be far too low.  2 stars would be far far too low.  And 1 star would be far far far too low.  Had I given this product any less than 5 stars, then I would be compelled to convey why that was.  But since I am made of nothing but time to review products on Amazon and I'm not busy trying to run two businesses during tax time, I should have elaborated more deeply about this OEM air filter than my first review which was 21 words an did meet the minimum, but Amazon decided not to post it anyway.
B000CQOIV4|4|An essential tool for anyone who has a hitch. I use it for my Rv hitch. As usual it came fast and there was no issues with shipping Amazon always does great with shipping it is one of my chief reasons for using Amazon.<br />This tool feels sturdy and seems like it will last. I always throw one in my Rv because you never know when you will need it. The first time I used it I was thanking my lucky stars I had it.
B00EOX2IRW|5|new house with wood floors, saves from scratches on floor from double stack when moved and will show water drips that accumulate.
B00MATPO1O|5|Brand new, worked as expected
B0013CXCYK|3|i purchase this product obviously to protect my rear bumper. it does a good job n its cheaper than buying the iron bumper guard
B000AR7KVA|5|Quickly fixes haze on headlights and worked to get my harley gas tank shining again.
B007AOQXXW|5|I bought Nifty for my Sequioa, I like these better.  They are very sturdy and deep.  You could probably sill a 32oz drink in the floor and not worry about any carpet wetting.
B008VJZ7DC|3|Obviously mediocre quality, one of the four bolt holes didn't fit the stock Harley sissy bar.  Chrome plated stamped steel, look decent, durability is to be determied...
B001C33YY8|1|Ordered for my 2004 Chrysler Pacifica and they didn't even come close to fitting... they wouldn't even slide down the top so I couldn't even try to get the bottom in :(
B001G6M2GC|5|Well basically, they were half the price that my local honda dealer was charging for MTF; and top of it the order arrived 4 days faster than expected.
B00A93UNL4|5|great product and shipping
B00QU6U0IK|4|Satisfied
B004NSEDQC|5|They are the perfect upgrade
B000HZUXNW|5|This item is exactly as advertised.  It provides  us a convenient location to store our personal items while traveling.  It 100% met our needs.
B000JUC33I|5|Purchased for myThule Parkway bike rack with 2&#34; reciever. Easy to install and works great for hauling my bikes at a safe distance from the back of my car. I also purchased a Curt 2&#34; reciever adapter.
B00362GL2K|5|I like these even more than I thought I would. They have a lot of rhinestones that bling and add beauty to your car floor. Good quality!
B00K7938LW|5|Very nice, two car washes so far and they are still on!
B006FUT05U|5|Easy application and works as described
B007KTINX0|3|Worked okay but not as well as other products I have used.
B00LVQA250|3|Great quality so far. Biggest down side is no directions or wiring diagram included. Also, wiring notes in item description are incomplete and incorrect. Be careful when wiring.
B008RJVKVY|5|fit perfect on 1999 ford 350 7.3
B000VS8DZU|1|This product looks like clear glue on your couches. It smells awful. It burns the existing upholstery as it is being placed and once it is dry it hardens and cracks anything it touched. My couches look 100 times worse after having used this. Before this we could have made do with maybe getting some arm rest flaps OR a sofa cover, now we have to get new couches. :(
B00B856ABO|1|Very pissed off about this item I just received them and they're not a chrome finish they're polished aluminum and they didn't come with the rings or clips I'm very pissed off. If your gonna sell something sell what your showing thanks for wasting my money on Christmas
B0007LMCNK|5|SM Arnold water sprite is the best synthetic drying cloth, period. I've tried others and purchased ones that they always hawk at auto shows and SM Arnold out performs them ten fold. I've stopped wasting my money on the other brands.
B00HRSHPR4|4|It came very quickly & will be cute on my car!
B002OUIXKS|5|Very good
B000CIGGXA|1|Didn't even come in the right color. H was red...
B003X7MMR6|5|Owesome very nice
B00177ETF2|2|I bought these mirrors because of the ease of use and fairly large viewing area, but not to big.  After installing, these were Great!  Just what I wanted, but from week to week, I noticed the view was   not a sharp as it was at first.  After several weeks, (two months),  the mirror face was beginning to show cracks and fading.  I had to   remove them and replace them with another Blind Spot Mirror.  I realize these mirrors wouldn't last forever, but I was very disappointed that they only lasted two months.  Maybe I got a set made in China. Oh, I forgot, everything we buy today is made in China.  Would not buy again for the price.
B00192JGN0|5|They fit great, seem to be prety durable.  One thing that would be nice - they should manufacture one edge a little shorter to fit around the wheel chocks.  Had a hard time getting cover to fit around my wheel shock where I felt it was secure, if they made a cut out to go around chock would be much better.  Will see how they hold up in long run.
B00N12RUFM|5|Super quality.  Thicker and better quality than I imaged.  The pics don't do it justice.  You'll be satisfied when they arrived.  Good purchase.  :-)
B00A82JLIC|5|Just what I needed and it works perfect.  Plus the price was excellent and shipping very quick without any problems whatsoever.  Recommend site and product.
B003E5X4NS|5|Cherry bomb is a cute name... but i would have named it &#34;Insta-growapair&#34; for trucks!!! I just took this man making shaft and stuck it on my 06 GMC sierra. After a few minutes of getting the right adapters at my local auto store, the pantie rattler was installed and complete. Thanks to my B.A. friend who welded it for me. Not only did I get an extra little boost of power but I got a full holographic, limited edition man card!!! I went from the lone ranger to the lady wrangler. I apologize to everyone who has to park in the same parking garage as me and has ever come out to find their car alarm going off. It doesn't just attract women but also other vehicles. What can I say, you vehicles are answering the pur of my untamed beast. People will begin to ask you grown up questions and expect you to answer them, being confused that you are actually a man, women will try and approach you, damsels in distress will call out to you in their time of need. The question is not whether or not to buy it, the questions is... Are you ready for that kind of responsibility.
B00RZN86GU|4|Excelente
B001SG8ZC0|5|Great
B000KYXD3C|5|I am interested in purchasing 2  but I was wondering if this would work for a 2006 Toyota corolla le/ce?<br />Thanks
B005OCYTS8|3|The sizing for the head seems correct, but the jaw area seems smaller.  So, it is tight if you have a big jaw or if you want to talk.
B000CIG0D6|4|Jaws worked well in protecting the A.N. Fittings.  Will be useful in the future also.
B000GUPS8I|4|a little thin, but overall a descent cover.
B009OG6K3M|5|Much better quality than expected. Great look too. Very stable. Not the best in cold weather riding but fantastic in the summer. I use them a lot.
B000K1HNSQ|4|I have not yet had the opportunity to use this product, but IT can not fail, especially given the construction, weight and cost.
B006QGD996|5|Great product!!!! I would buy it again!!!
B000CEG2HE|5|This was very straight forward to install. The only issue I ran into was getting the 3 inch inlet pipe onto the cat outlet pipe. I had to to do some sanding on the outlet pipe and cut a small line down so the pipe would compress enough to get the new pipe over it. Other than that it was snap, I had it on and working in under 2 hours. Now my truck has a nice growl to it and the dual tips poking out the side looks sharp. Recommended all around
B00DQ9XFO0|5|great product
B00DWKZ9VU|1|Both sets flickered badly. Not sure if its just the bulbs or what but I was not happy with this product
B002X6VXL4|5|great insurance for car if you have battery problem
B000CN9376|5|these bushings defiantly help stabilize your shift lever and give a tighter fell while shifting.<br />would get another set in the future.
B002G3OG6S|5|Arrived on time.  Easy installation. Product is solid and priced great compared to local auto parts stores.
B000F399JA|5|Definite stopper. Well built. Very pleased. No issues at all. I only have one side done at this point, can't wait to get them both finished.
B000HBNTX2|5|This is awesome workman's hand soap.  Been using it for 16 years and counting.  No complaints. Just rub into hands before adding water and your hands will be spotless in seconds.
B00BVL7M26|5|I don't know why I never knew these existed before. This thing is awesome. I've used a few other wire stripping tools, where you have to choose the right section of the tool depending on the thickness of your wire, but not with this thing. Just insert your wire and squeeze the trigger. It has a confident sounding click and boom it's done. My kids actually had fun using it too, hehe
B0000AZ7WJ|5|Great lock, very easy to use and of good quality. Price was right for the purchase, would recommend to anyone interested in a similar product.
B00DM9ZIDK|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B00698FFKW|5|Works good for my chainsaw- 455 rancher mounted to the bar.
B00BTGDR9A|5|Nice kit
B00032K1QI|5|It's plain and black but that's why I bought it.
B001LHVOVK|5|great tool for the price! worked just as described.
B00030BFJW|3|I have owned this product for a few years and it was great the few times I needed it. Apparently I had gotten better at not leaving my car on because I haven't had to use it for about a year. BUT the other day I needed it and had to recharge it and even partially charged I couldn't get it to jump my van.  When it finally said it was recharged I put it back in my van to keep. Unfortunately I went to use it today and discovered that it hadn't held the charge. AT ALL. Not good timing either, I was running out the door to get in carpool line. I haven't decided if I'll buy it again. I probably will, because with the amount it cost divided by the number of times it DID work for me it was still worth the time saved having to find somebody else to help jump my car or waiting for AAA.
B0058KYUWQ|5|Worked well
B001U04NCA|4|(This review has been changed)    I've knocked off a star because it died within about 8 months.  Like others, I was not able to return this product, but I was given a full refund of my purchase price and told to do with the unit as I please.  I've removed the battery and will replace it somewhere along the line.  So while I can't give it 5 stars because it died, I also can't give it one star because they gave me a total refund and the battery can be replaced.  Once I get a brand new battery in it, I'm sure it will meet or exceed all my needs.
B001RJN56Y|4|It doesnt get any better than this. It lasts about 2-3 weeks and smells great! yummy bubble gum. I do wish it would last a little bit longer due to the cost of it.
B003UT1V38|4|Great glossy shine and pretty easy application. Unfortunately, like any gel, there is some sling. I've seen posts where others have minimized this by using &#34;multiple thin layers,&#34; but haven't been able to duplicate. That is the only loss of a star - otherwise really like the product.
B0082YY08E|5|Good part, good price, brand new.  Now if I only had some instructions on how to install it I'd be all set!
B003Z9T33I|4|This cover fit great only draw back is the plastic clamps that hold it down, you only get 4 and how long will the plastic hold up before they start to break, the other thing is the plastic clips that hold the cover when you fold it to the front. How long will those last till they dry up from the weather, then what. Over all the price is right its seals tight tried the water test. Had it 1 month so lets see how long I get out of it.
B000C7YE8U|3|I have this for a 1985 Nissan 300zx.  It didn't exactly match up but I made it work.  It makes a distinct whine that the old one didn't.  I'll just have to drive with the stereo turned up so I don't have to hear.
B00TPQJ62S|5|fast shipping. great quality
B00G0KRHK0|5|Item arrived fast! And as described!
B000E3CYIY|3|Love the product, but it stretched out very quickly.  I ended up sewing it on the steering wheel in order to use it.  Good Sheepskin, just to loose; to quick.
B000NVW1LM|5|Easy to follow instructions on the label. Not an instant overnight fix. But does work.<br />I am buying another bottle for a transmission fluid weep on my BMW.
B006SO1PXS|5|I have had these on my trailer quite a while and I'm very pleased with the quality and how bright they are. Would definitely recommend.
B004107292|4|I think the pump woorks pretty well. It takes a while to siphon 5 gallons but so far so good.
B009E9J1Y4|5|Works great!  Awesome to be able to lock all the doors with a remote, very strong signal too.
B00FRM9LMO|5|It's perfect! Fits awesome! Would buy again. Fast shipping too!
B0002STSQM|5|Bought this to occasionally check the depth of all my car tires. This gauge functions as expected with a couple of minor reservations. Firstly, the pocket clip is not attached securely onto the gauge, and easily slips/falls off (just be careful when placing and removing from pockets, as it is easily lost). Secondly, there is some thin lube between the moving parts of the gauge (which may stain certain fabrics, so be careful in the pockets). Other than those two reservations, this is a perfect affordable tire depth gauge.<br /><br />When checking, always make sure to check at different points over the width of the tire (to check for uneven wear from camber problems), and at several points around the circumference of the tire (to check for roundness and uneven wear). Check at least twice a year, and you'll know how your tires are wearing, and be able to determine when you may need to finally get new tires (at 2/32&#34;).
B00AC812IY|5|If I am to be honest I must say I am a pretty clumsy person, so all my devices need protective cases. Especially my ipad!! I shopped around but couldn't find any case I was happier with than this one. The folds really help keep the case on firmly but it remains flexible. Great material too, very smooth
B005HH61H2|4|It fits properly, and seems to be rugged and strong. Good value for the price. Could not find one anywhere for this price
B000MK5LWK|5|This is a great tool box! I am actually using it for a toy box for my son since his room is decorated with retro cars. The first one came in with a ding in the front damaged from shipping, but amazon promptly arranged pick up for the item and sent me another one! Completely satisfied with this purchase!
B000GV2YY8|5|Fits perfectly. East to install.
B008OWCYTQ|4|I chose to give this product 4 stars because I think the pricingis kind of ridiculous for a piece of cloth, basically. I really like it though, it prevents sun-damage on my dashboard and adds a nice, decorative touch. It was fairly easy to install, but doesn't come with enough velcro to install it completely.
B000TTM582|5|Bought them for my daughter and she loves it all. Very cute in her car.
B001CF1A7O|5|Looks good and made well. I haven't had the need to use it, but I'm sure it will work great.<br />I Purchased it to have in case I need to be or need to pull someone out of the sand.
B007TG7HXG|5|Excellent product; and it was easy to install. I would buy this again and recommend this product to others. !
B0049EL7PU|5|Great price and fast shipping
B00BR1TP2A|5|Lights up the woods behind my house just like I hoped it would. Now hopefully I can see what the critters are I hear back there at night.
B000ABADXI|3|Excellent set of Klein Screwdrivers, but as different in pictures it does not  Includes 1 short Keystone Tip Screwdriver, its came with 2 short Phillips Tip Screwdriver
B00P9R1TH2|1|Different threads than my cans.  This is for the newer type cans, not the old style I was hunting.  These are useless to me.
B00L90F3O8|5|Gave my travel trailer a great new look.
B00D6YFX0O|3|Great product
B000NIXMV8|5|I bought this vest a while back and I gotta say the quality is amazing! Like everyone else has said though, make sure you get a size larger then what you usually wear. On warm days when I just want to ride my motorcycle I wear this all day and it's stylish and fits great!
B000CNBPJU|4|Work very well. I did have to do a little grinding to get them to fit in the caliper, but it was pretty minor. Seem to work well so far. Using these with EBC GC7013 3GD Series Dimpled and slotter rotors. Can really tell in wet conditions that they are working.
B001LHXTO0|1|Scanner would connect to car OK but almost always locked up just prior to giving me any useful information.  After 20 tries or so it once managed to get to the screen that shows the error codes, but I couldn't get that sucess to repeat.  The screen was also scratched when I received it.
B0065T70KI|5|beyond happy I replaced cable for plow with this. ended up ordering a second one for my other quad. was just that satisfied. super easy install. and no problems or sign of wear after a season of plowing. great shipping and awesome company to deal with.
B0046ID5EK|5|First of all I received my order several days before I was expecting it. Then It took me all of 15 seconds to program the two remotes I ordered. It didn't come with instructions on how to program but luckily I researched it and knew what to do. They work perfect and I am honestly thinking about ordering another one.
B00651BGJ2|4|Bought this for my husband because his used GMC Sierra came without an antenna.  Took seconds to install and works just great.  We like the low profile so that it doesn't catch on trees, etc., especially when we take our truck on camping trips.
B001CF4UXU|5|Looks good used it once worked!
B00COBENQA|4|This camera when placed in the right position makes it very easy for me to hitch up by myself.  I can literally hitch up in minutes and I purchased this unit over others for those &#34;what if&#34; situations.  What if it's raining... what if it's dark, what if I'm by myself.<br /><br />Minus 1 star because I wish it had better range so that I can stick it on the back of my trailer and use it as a back camera as well.  It doesn't have good enough range for a trailer as long as mine (30ft).  If you have a 19ft trailer... it might work just fine for that reason.
B0016WIWXI|2|Bought this and tried to install.  Got it in and would not lock. Instructions said to remove and bend arms.  If I have to bend something to make it work,then it is NOT made for my truck,so I returned it.  Called Chevy dealer and got one actually made for my truck for the same price as this.
B002P8HJ0E|5|This part took me about a total of 10 minutes to install, and was an exact match to the original part in appearance.
B0068EU7SW|5|It is a well made billet. It fits perfectly. The installation was very quick. I love it and would highly recommend it.
B000CMHCC0|5|Relatively easy installation,  sturdy, looks and works great.
B005EVARDU|4|I have installed several starters from bull dog, this is a good unit with good tech support for the install
B004B61B34|5|its a hitch - I needed one and got one - haven't  pulled a load but works grate for the bike rack and the cooler rack.
B009FU7RZM|5|I have to admit I'm a bit of a suspension nerd with my cars, and I knew my shocks were shot on my '03 2500HD work truck. I knew it would drive better with new shocks, but I'm quite surprised by the improvement in the ride and stability of the truck with these Bilsteins. I recommend them highly. Also recommend replacing the steering damper which made a noticable improvement in steering feel.
B00GB7JOXA|4|This cover is as advertised. Good heavy material, strong elastic cord. I hope it lasts longer than the white vinyl one I bought last year which was destroyed by the AZ sun. It actually came within 2 days and in an appropriately sized box!
B0082CB29Q|5|I purchased these door sills to replace the original ones on my 2011 Camaro.  The chrome plating over aluminum is flawless.  The inlayed painted sections are likewise flawless.  Installation instructions are very clear.  Just be sure that you are positive with positioning the sill before final installation.  Once in place, the 3M automotive will hold it forever.  I used masking tape to located forward and outside edges of the sill.  Then after remove the factory sill, I use narrow strips of corrugated material to provide positive locators for the sill and then installed them.  Following installation, I rolled the sill with a 2 inch roll of duct tape to seat the 3M tape.  They just add a higher level of quality to the car when opening the door.
B00BQ03IFW|5|Matches my paint perfect on my atc
B006R7AW6M|5|Great product looks awesome
B00CLESN5M|5|Loved it
B0012TTAWM|3|Be advised that although the picture shows 2 knobs, you only get 1 knob.
B000ED7YCA|4|Works as advertised but the picture shown isn't the actual product. It's red with the mesh wire on the outside. These are made by K&N filters. I don't recall if they're the first who made open air filters but they were the most popular. They look exactly like K&N but no oil is necessary.    The benefit of not having the oil is you can't get your mass airflow sensor or throttle body contaminated.
B004PGIK9S|5|Bestop is very good quality.
B0007LEG2K|4|This was a gift for my boyfriend and he says it works really great. He is a mechanic and it has helped him read codes for several problems already.
B001B5MBG4|1|the fly wheel matched up to my car in your data base but was to big for my car and cost my money for labor.
B004L5FHRQ|1|Spend a extra $10 and get something that fits the vehicle, disappointing.
B00M3NEBMK|5|Nice material, not scratchy or too bulky.  Performs as expected.
B008XB9BJY|5|I've tried many others that burnt out and let me down. These are the only ones that have NOT given me any issues and have kept cool and kept working. Very please with them. I'll buy some extras as back up.
B00437GM44|1|Within a year of buying this winch, it failed completely.  I bought this with some hesitation as it seemed that there was a fair number of unhappy customers with similar tales.  Initially, it worked great but then stopped working altogether.  Although it was about a year after purchase, I had only used the winch a handful of times.  I cannot recommend this product based on my experience.
B005DMZIW0|4|i really like this product. it looks really good im my car. i got it a week before xmas. now all i have to do is get a few more things and my car will be complete.
B005C5FFTY|5|These should be standard equipment.  Helps with bugs, stones, cold wind.
B001B7RS4M|4|The box installed in 10 minutes, and fit perfect and is well built. I plan to buy one for the passenger side.
B00BI43H0M|4|I installed these on my 2011 Ram 1500 quad cab. The name is spot on; they're an exact fit for all the seats, arm rest, console, and head rests! They seem to be made of average quality materials, but time will tell. My wife says they fell like a fold up camping chair but thinner material. The rear covers use Velcro to attach to the bottom of the seat. When the Velcro stops sticking, I'll have straps with buckles sewn on, like the fronts have. If they fall apart, believe me, I'll update this review. I would recommend these seat covers.
B00DP3Y6IG|5|Greta fit<br />Great company
B0013RIOMK|5|Put on my 2003 Rubicon and they look great and were better quality than expected. A literal snap to install. Took about 5 minutes install time. Quick Prime shipping, Thanks!
B0046ID5EK|5|Very good price and works like a charm.
B000630G28|5|It is the exact replacement I needed.  I know you can wash them but mine was going on 7 years old, time to just buy a new one.
B000ALJYEW|5|You lower a little clamp by loosening two phillips-head screws, slide it over your mirror housing, and tighten them.  The clamp is a little floppy, but it's not a problem.  It gives a clear, wide-angle view.  For a tall person, on a passenger car, the roof may cut off part of your view of the mirror.
B008GWG7QU|5|Love it no dirt gets past this filter easy to clean fair price and reusable saves money have it in my rzr4
B007Y5LGZC|5|I bought these for my Subaru SVX. They were a great deal over OEM. My mechanic also complimented the quality of these CV axles. They work great!
B001EOV3JS|5|Toyota Tacoma Curt harness was easy to install 15 minutes. good price, fast shipping, works as advertised. I would highly recommend this T-connecter.
B000630DM6|5|super perfect
B004I16WK4|4|Product was brand new and fit perfectly.
B000FPXUHK|1|I ordered this to replace the old one in my Jeep. It installed easily and initially solved my problem. However after a month my headlights stopped working completely. The black plastic broke away from the metal base. I used zip ties to hold it together until I order a different brand. Avoid this product.
B006R170LI|4|They work in one direction only, they didn't light up at first but once I switched sides they worked, they are bright, white clear light, not amber at all. Shipping was slow, came from overseas and didn't include a sticker as advertised thus the four stars. I would buy these again.
B004016ND8|1|Buyer Beware! I purchased this hose in September 2012. I had to access a part near this hose and went to take it off. It fell apart at all three junctions like it was 100 years old. Car was an Audi A4 2001 Quatro.
B005DPNUZ4|5|Comfortable fit. No &#34;mushroom head&#34;. Color is a perfect match to my Honda Grom.
B0073WEZU4|5|Easy install, remove the stock antenna and screw this one in. Looks much better than the tall stock antenna. Although I normally listen to Sirius/XM, this antenna seems to have good reception the couple of times I have used it.
B00ATXEPQI|3|Past inverter struggled with laptop.  Bought this, no problem and also doubles as a phone, mp3, etc... charger as well.  Considering the price of many modles in this voltage range was concerned.  No problem, great deal.<br /><br />Update:  Worked great for about a year then fried itself.  Still good for price but plan on replacing after a year.
B009DIX46M|5|The quality of the Spectre performance air filter is as good as or maybe better than the &#34;other&#34; reusable air filter. This filter is obviously well made, stitching or attachment points such as where cotton meets the rubber are great. But the most notable, is the cost to value. While you're saving money, it's not at the expense of quality! I think Spectre has a customer for life. The ONLY thing missing was the sticker that goes outside the filter housing advising the filter is reusable. What a small price to pay for savings.
B000C11JHU|1|Bought this for a friend to fix his window in his car. It broke about two months later. Not very satisfied.
B001F2I7SE|5|Love this item! I was of course, skeptical at first, that I could leave my vent open in the rain.  Why would I risk water &#34;maybe&#34; getting in? This cover does deliver! Mainly for leaving the vent open all day to allow some ventilation in (or out) in the summer heat; I hated rushing home to close the vent when I saw a hint of a gray cloud.  With this cover on, I have stood in the camper looking up while it was pouring and not a drop of rain.  The really HARD rains and heavy wind will blow some droplets in and they can even bounce back off the camper roof and up the vents if it is hard enough.  I tested on my bathroom vent because it was closer to the edge of the roof and the install was easier. Now I want another for the bedroom vent. The install went just fine - followed the instructions and watched their online install video and it really did install that easy - drill the hinge side, attach, drill the fixed side, attach and voila!  I know most people love this for the extra side vents, which is a good feature, but the linchpin for me was the hinged access.  I love being able to climb up, open the cover and vacuum out the little gnats etc that can fit through the screens on the vent and lay/die on the inside vent screen. My only problem is getting one in time for our last trip of the season!
B00EEGJ7LY|1|They seent wrong part did not feel like returning just dealt with it
B00FIX7KHA|1|It only work for a month. ....this product sucks......!!!!!!
B001M6AGE6|3|They sent me the wrong charger. I thought I was ordering one brand and ended up with an entirely different brand. The other one works just fine (though I have to rubber band the battery in since it doesn't fit snugly) but it works OK. I would have sent it back for a replacement but since this one worked I just didn't want to be bothered with shipping charges, waiting and all the rest. I needed a charger and got one, just not the one I thought I was getting. Over all I'm okay with the purchase but it could have went a little better. (they did ship it out right away so kudos for that)
B008BR74YY|3|No electric motor installed inside
B000CO8ZUG|5|Good replacement
B0007RDVFC|5|This is probably the best wax I've used.  Works great on my black truck.
B00FC22DNS|4|I bought this HID kit to complement my Halo headlights. I originally bought them for the low beams and then switched them to the high beams which I'm switching back to the loews as it takes a while for them to warm up to full brightness.  the 5000 degree color is pure white!!! and bright for 55w.<br />The reason for the 4 stars is that I had to flip the wiring to make them work. So the positive from the lights were ground on My 2001 GMC Sierra. So anyone out there, don't just send them back, flip the plug!!!!<br />Seller is great and very responsive. I definitely recommend buying these.
B004P9C5H8|5|I ran off a county road into 4 feet of fresh powder. I couldn't get out by myself, but the tow truck driver said, &#34;Nice strap!&#34;<br /><br />Enough said.
B005GDZOKC|5|Perfect!
B0085G9P84|5|Looks great.  Little difficult for me to install since I am not a mechanic.  May have to spread the plug on the old fixture to ensure a working collection.  Looks great, cheaper than other outlets.  Highly recommend.
B00J00X7QK|5|This is by far the most cost effective way to buy Mobil 1 that I've come across.
B00AB5DO6G|5|fast shipping. great product
B0052FRXU8|3|Nice price, however not easy to install. I required a professional to make some adjustments. Still is ok for the price
B008M1WB7E|5|What else is there to say about custom-cut floor mats, they fit exactly where and how they're supposed to, and &#34;install&#34; took about 30 seconds.<br /><br />The mats are just a little slick, not bad but if you're used to solid rubber floor mats the texture of these take some getting used to.<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the driver's side mat doesn't have an inside lip that goes up as far as the passenger mat, and considering that the driver's boot is RIGHT THERE you would think that is where the mat should have extra protection.  But whatever, I knew that going in, just pointing it out.
B009OBVRY4|4|I love the product but don't think you can do big jobs with it. Perfect for those stubborn spots and smaller jobs.Perfect with a right angle CORDED drill.
B000F5JM0O|5|got me outta a few jams already..good tool to have if you work on cars...especially your own...made ez work outta my complete coolant flush...
B00CIZZ2CQ|5|Performs as intended.  Absolutely need a hood strut for this car!
B003S6GWQ4|5|I am replacing the other side with these too! They're not the same color as the original, but the black actually looks great! Clean look, good-durable quality, & took only minutes to install. You must take off door panel, but YouTube made it simple. Love!!
B001JT1IPM|5|I purchased this bag in order to retire a tired old bag.  I recently used it with great satisfaction.  It is quality material and well constructed.  It \\"travels\\" well and holds everything I need with room to spare.  The supplier represented the product and delivery accurately.
B006V4H4NU|1|This product is very misleading.  I didn't realize there wasn't a size on the webpage and it's so small that a person in another car will never see it until they get up very close.  Also, it should be magnetic and larger!
B001S7ZT5A|5|Ok this stuff works, my car looks like it has no glass now, I can't believe this stuff.. my glass was soo dirty first of all, cloth went from white to black in 2 min!!  gonna treat with rainx treatment next (waiting for delivery.. hmm purchased they same day, got this a week ago, but still no treatment..)
B00029WSWC|2|This mirror provides the extra visibility I was looking for but it makes everything look a little smaller than in the OEM rear-view.  That's not a big deal, but it also gives me a headache to look at it.  It's like looking through prescription glasses that don't belong to you.
B0028JBEBK|5|This shade keeps my car cool when it's hot out. The price is cheap compared to other places my husband and I looked. Is a perfect fit for this vehicle.
B00DWKZQTK|3|First it was good then since yesterday one of the ballast gets hot and you turn off my head light and it will not turn on again. I already change the bulb and still the same thing
B003AU5KPW|5|bought this as a backup incase anything goes wrong on installation. Am looking forward to many years of service form this and the original part
B00EHKNT66|5|Perfect fit no problems what so ever.
B000KL72DC|1|Ordered Wheathertech for 2014 Chevy Silverado 2500 LT Diesel.  Front fit okay, but rear floor liner were about 3 1/2 inches short on both sides of truck.  On top of price $254.00 with $18 shipping they refuse to pay for my return shipping which with UPS (or FedEx) is $43.00.  So it cost me $61.00 to try Weathertech floor liners.  I DON'T RECOMMEND THEIR PRODUCT TO ANYONE.  Their advertisement sounds good about custom fits, but they don't tell you they don't fit.<br />Photo of rear floor liner attached.
B004I0N2WG|5|after the original one got burned after the bulb exploited due a hole on the lens and water, I installed this one with some white light bulb I got from amazon and the fit is perfect the bulb is bright and the fog assembly looks amazing with no scratches or oxidation
B00LNDKXF0|5|Very close replacement for my new to me 35 year old sunline camper.  Old tail lights were brittle, when I went to check on one or the bulbs, the plastic cracked!  Nothing a little tape couldn't handle right?  Went to attach the license plate and both of the plastic tabs cracked off!  Found these replacement tail lights and within a half hour, the lights were installed looking great
B009RUCHWI|2|FANTASTIC light, great color, nice packaging lots of upside.  HOWEVER, as many others have said, they burn out quick (few months)!
B008YMTCNC|5|We bought the &#34;extender&#34; to use on our Toyota Tacoma when we haul our kayaks.  What a dream to use!  Our kayaks are 12' and 14'.  We have a rack system for my Subaru Forester but lifting the kayaks to the roof and then straping them down was a bit of a task.  With this extender we just slide the Kayaks on the back of the truck, attach a few quick straps to the tie downs on the truck bed and of we go!  It came with reflective tape in a few stratigic places (we added a little more).  The rig seems plenty strong and stable for our needs.  We love it!
B00BJCHTFW|4|Works great for adding tire dressing!
B000S2U5XW|5|It looks like it's hit or miss with the 'Garage' configuration tool on Amazon.  This item showed it would NOT fit my 2008 Sky Redline, but it would fit my 1996 Camaro SS.  Well that's strange because I took the stock antenna from my SS to test fit on the Redline and it did indeed fit, proper thread and length.  I ordered an 'open box' of this item from Amazon warehousedeals, less than $15.00 to my door - we have to pay sales tax now here... Anyway, long story - short - fits perfect and way better reception than the stubby antenna the previous owner had on the Redline.  Based on price and function 5 Stars.  The Amazon Garage could use a little work though.  Do your homework before ordering.
B00JIJ992E|5|Great packaging.<br />These things get REALLY hot, enough to burn you.  Should have more cooling ability.  I'm changing how mine are installed and using some thermal epoxy to mount them to my bike's frame directly instead of holding them as I drive down the road.<br />The wires remind me of dynomite fuse.  They're easy to strip and use but take forever to light so I wouldn't bother trying to use them as dynomite fuse.<br />The wire tap clips are fine but usually undependable so I recommend you cut, strip and solder these.  That should teach them.<br />Once you're done with that, also cut, strip and solder the wires to your lights.
B007SB5ON2|5|My husband bought some diesel fuel additive at a local store and it froze this winter.  This did not freeze, which impressed my husband.  Good product.
B00NGZMBI0|3|DOesn't fit very well
B000NPNXH4|5|The device is very easy to install, if you have the proper tools, ie wire connectors, crimper and perhaps a volt meter if you need to find your brake light wire.  It took me about 10 minutes or so, to isolate the brake light wire in the rear harness of my bike and about 3 minutes to cut and splice the device into the circuit. The device works as advertised, at least on my 2010 Vulcan 900 Classic LT.    Whether or not it significantly improves your brake light visibility in bright daylight conditions, I don't know.  But, it certainly works very well in darker conditions and at night.     I purchased this device in addition to their plug and play version of this product, [[ASIN:B001F88OCM SIGNAL DYNAMICS MODULE HEADLIGHT 01013]] and this product, [[ASIN:B000GVB0FM Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Classic Cobra Lightbar Light Bar LT]].   All of these devices are designed to improve your visibility.  I really like the Cobra light bar and this brake light device.  The headlight module hasn't arrived yet, so I don't know about it yet.     I live in the Detroit metro area and I believe that a biker needs all the visibility that he can get while driving in the traffic associated with large cities. You'll never know how many drivers will \\"see\\" you because of these devices that would not have without them, but I believe that they are worth the cost and effort if they only prove effective once.  Nothing will protect you from the complete idiots that you encounter.
B003VGHB8Y|5|Great product and price!
B004A2IFII|5|only one to buy
B000IYDEOC|2|I bought this wiper after reading good reviews. I believed that a company with such good name will make good product. It was very good initially and I was happy that I bought it. After few months of use, It feels like good name of BOSCH is worthless at least for wiper blades. It is not doing what it is supposed to do. I am hesitant to use it at times; instead of cleaning water it spreads it.      With price so high of premium product, I wonder why they made this product if they can not maintain premium quality? They made this wiper just for the sake of it.  I feel like I was fool to buy. I will never buy this product from BOSCH and definitely think thrice before deciding on any BOSCH product.
B001S8F2V0|5|Works great and Amazon has the best price around
B000KV5PD6|3|Definitely not as thick as OEM mats, but the mat extends to the second row, so OK value for the amount of money spent.
B007RJL9RK|5|like the title says, it was a good buy. i was expecting there to be a little sacrifice in clarity, but it sounds almost identical. very happy with this
B004TRKBOK|4|Product arrived quickly and I hope to never have to use them!
B001O9V6VS|2|The product works fine one installed but it doesn't come with the necessary screws to install it. I went to lowes and bought similar screws but what a hassle... The original ones can't easily be reinstalled (if at all). You tube had a video of a vendor that included the screws. Stupidly, I thought everyone would because without the screws, its a paper weight.
B0077M24EY|5|Perfect fit and easy to install. Fast shipping too! Don't have to worry about the bugs getting in to the vents now!
B0073UMAVM|1|Update: after 2 months of use, it failed terribly... the solenoid locked in the power on position, and by the time I realized it, got the seat off, and pulled the positive power cable from the battery, the output post of the solenoid had melted into the housing, the negative post on the battery had melted into itself, and the starter was cooked and internally damaged and smoking as well as melting the ends of the wiring on each component.. I'm<br />Going to contact the seller to see if they will at least send a new solenoid, I will request, but doubt they will replace, the battery, starter, or associated wiring.. may install an inline fuse to prevent this type of damage from happening again if they send a replacement, since my timberwolf only has one to break contact from the start button, not between the battery-solenoid-starter circuit.. I will update with their response.<br /><br />Perfect match for my 1997 250 timberwolf. Works perfect, 2 minute install, no more screwdriver and sparks to start!!
B00KMKWUSS|4|PROS: Price compared to dealer purchased is about half the cost<br />Seems to be sturdy construction.<br /><br />CONS: No installation instructions unless you read Chinese and have a magnifying glass to read the very small diagram.<br />I took off one star for lack of instructions.<br /><br />Construction is heavy aluminum rails with fiberglass molded end caps.  Mounting is done with included bolts.  It comes with a tube of RTV sealant but there are no instructions on what it is to be used for.  You should be reasonably adept with tool use to install this.  The rails are held down with fiberglass/plastic pieces which are bolted to the vehicle roof then the end caps cove up the mounts and bolts.
B0009IQXJ0|5|For its price it performed really well. I like it very much. Just have to do what all the other tire gels all required to do: wipe of the excess n it will turn out beautiful. One other thing: really, if u wait it out overnite it does best.
B00BAZBKHG|1|Very displeased. They original radiator clutch fan started ticking at 120k miles. Order first replacement and installed on my GMC which is not an easy job. Very little clearance and timing consuming. After first install the new part started ticking a week or two later. I was sent a new part immediately and a return shipping label which was convenient and fast I must say. Now after second install of new part the clutch fan is now ticking after 3 or 4 weeks. Labor lost but more frustrating having to do the same repair for a third time.
B001R9NZEQ|5|I got this just a couple days ago but it's been raining so I have not yet placed it on my car - but I will soon.<br />I am a Twilight Girl. My daughters think I'm a bit crazy about all the Twilight items I own and display - but hey - this is what I love.
B003O75N30|4|Great unit with one fault:  with a few items in the unit it tends to sag, blocking my rear-view mirror.  Otherwise well constructed and useful.
B0002Q80GS|5|bought for customer never saw him again
B002ESXIOQ|5|Received as per the order, everything seems OK.
B0002STSC6|5|I purchased two of these at the same time to use for small engine repairs. They work great just and what I was looking for to better help me diagnose a running issue.
B008CIEDT6|2|I was really excited to find these, a low price way to jazz up my 1984 YJ. Unfortunately, not 3 around the neighborhood drives, and one of the &#34;Jeep&#34; inserts was gone from the tire valve. Now it's just a shiny silver tire valve. Bummer.
B00F2PILGS|5|I purchased a similar device on ebay which connects to your Intake Air Temperature sensor. The results were amazing in my Chevy Cruze. The throttle response and improved acceleration was what I noticed first. I can also feel the turbo kicking in much earlier to shift through gear more easily. It took a little getting used to the extra power and not need to give it a smuch gas taking off. Saves almost 2mpg.
B006K8O77I|4|Great product. Very strong piece of work. Only issue is dimensions were not given to tell me how big around it is at the base or flange. I had to cut my springs about a 2inchs from the center coil to make it fit right. Other than that it worked great and I will continue to buy more of them. Ps. Make a 4 inch one. Thanks
B00904KZ8Y|5|we got these for our son to wear when he rides his razor motorcycle.  They are great and he loves them
B001OJJWWI|5|Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.
B001KN13C0|5|Surprisingly quick and as described.
B004JI3AZQ|2|The filter looked great unfortunately the O ring supplied with filter wasn't the correct size, I had to replace it with the old O ring.
B00HXTMOQE|3|The Locking Fuel cover was...weird, and the ignition switch itself was defective...However, the company itself was willing to refund me most of the money...I kept all of the parts and received $41 out of $52 dollars back...Even though the Ignition switch was inoperable.
B007Y5LSG4|5|Perfect fit and having no problems so far which is great.. well worth the money ecspecially for two.. I'm happy
B000C9J30M|1|In the picture show nine things, but only come five, four brake pad and one brake lube nothing more then what do you think about this don´t put thing incomplete or change the picture because i´m buy this brake pads for the brake headbands and they aren´t thanks for you attention
B00415TYP2|1|Don't buy these lights.  Even with the crummy gasket they include, these lights still let water in.  Before it rained I installed these pieces of junk and found them impossible to adjust much further than nearly straight down.  Once they start moving upwards to the correct position, the adjusters pop out of the socket, causing the lights to point straight down again.  Not to mention the bulbs that they come with are dimmer than the originals you're replacing.  Then it drizzled and the next day all kinds of condensation was inside the lens. Very disappointing.  I requested a return and opened a ticket, and soon after was sent a notification that the situation was resolved and the ticket was closed with zero communication with these shady sellers.  Save your money and avoid these fly-by-night junk dealers.  I'll sell you my set of theirs for half price.
B002J854UC|3|I cannot tell the difference of just a regular car waxing when compared to using a sealant product instead. Also, it must take of a little of the paint each time it is applied as my yellow cloths end up being darken by my black car where the actual product does not have any black color in it from what I can tell.
B00A23V5EU|5|Installed perfectly and runs correctly.
B0012X26QK|4|I have very little auto repair skill. After watching some videos online I thought I could replace the front struts in my Geo Prizm myself. I bought jack stands, 13/32 cobalt drill bit, torque wrench, breaker bar and a combination wrench. I really didn't have too much trouble with the job. Make sure you have a round 10mm file on hand if you are drilling larger mount holes. The drill bit can get stuck and create pesky burs.
B00116X5EK|1|this thing sucks. said it would fit my bikes swingarm LIE!!!! this would only work in a 250 maybe. not my zx6r.
B00IKPV2JU|5|easy to install. solved the problem
B000GBLYL2|5|This unit was subject to an extended operating cycle (nearly 3 hours) during its first use and performed without fault. It's well made, quiet, and smooth running.  It's 3 CFM capacity made short work of reaching 30\\"hg and maintaining it.  Competitively priced units offer only 1 to 2 CFM.
B000LNIJEU|5|MAC COURT WINDOW WELL COVER 43\\"L x 14\\"W x 12\\"H fit my window well perfectly. The only drawback is that it could be a little thicker and more durable.
B000C6KMAK|5|Bought a bunch of these and popped them onto my 2003 Honda Shadow Spirit 750. They fit perfectly and seem to be working fine so far. Beats spending two or three times that (or more) from the local auto shop, that's for sure.
B005CLLM2C|5|perfect fit for my 2004 chevy avalanche
B000C9JVWC|5|Improved my fuel milage
B00BMRRZ94|3|Plug's fine but that wrench sure isn't going to fit in any RV I know of.
B001UGJPXQ|4|The stabilizer does work and takes some of the wobble out of the trailer, but it's not perfect.  make sure you use one near the entrance and counter on the opposite side.  This balances it out ok.  Still a pretty good deal for the two I bought!
B00361WPGM|5|They look AMAZING, and the screw covers are a wonderful finishing touch!
B0056DS7SS|5|The emblem fit perfectly on my 2007 Honda Civic Coupe Ex!!! Looks great and its good material. The color is not cheap it doesn't fade easily like other emblems out there that are cheap to buy.
B00DLMKTOQ|1|BUYER BEWARE- I would advise you choose a different company to purchase HID headlights from. Nothing but bad luck with these XENTEC's.
B004GF0J88|5|Matches the original perfectly, and came in good condition. Fitment was exact, and this is a greta price for it.
B00HE7SJ7S|5|Very bright. Good buy.
B00537FBIG|5|It took two of us to put in on but it is a  well-made hitch and it fit like it was supposed to
B006Z9TZ9M|5|This stuff is amazing, i use it everywhere that needs a little grease.  A small amount goes a long way.
B0023VKJ6O|4|The 2nd part shipped was the part I ordered and it fit perfect.  Company was prompt in correcting  the 1st shipping error.
B000A0CAXA|3|I should have checked out my cart more carefully before placing my last order.  I wanted one of the new Fram \\"washable\\" filters, as in \\"wash off with soapy water and rinse with clean water.\\"  The Fram Airhog filter I received is the type that has to be washed, dried and oiled using special products.  A call to Fram and I discovered they no longer make the filter, cleaner or oil.  They said I could use the K&N products to service the filter. The shipping label on the package has an individuals name and address on it, not the company name from which I thought I was purchasing it.  Also there was no receipt, invoice or indication of how much my credit card was to be charged. [[ASIN:B000A0CAXA FRAM PPA6690 Air Hog Panel Filter]]
B0019C17H8|5|Husband was very happy with this. It fit good .
B000H8Z0Y6|1|I purchased these lamp assemblies expecting OEM quality.  What I got, was much less.  The lenses fit, but not without using excess force.  If that were all, I'd be happy.  Once night fall hit I knew I had a problem.  The beam pattern, focus and intensity nowhere near match the OEM.  I've returned these and am going to try another brand.  If that fails, I'll purchase the genuine article.
B000HNL86A|5|These are just the rightr lug nuts I was looking for. They fit my car just like the OEM ones.
B005DPNQR6|1|What a piece of junk. I would never buy this again. It fell apart the first week. I guess this is standard quality from China.
B00332GMKY|5|fit perfectly.  Product exactly as described!
B00O1QUUKY|5|Received as described. Works very well. Timely. Thanks
B00DSR1XCG|5|Good quality helmet for a good price and the brake light option is nice too. Wished the button to flip up/down the chin guard release was made better or stronger.
B009S94LWC|5|It's hard to find 17&#34; wheel covers at a reasonable price, but here they are! A+
B0077HHV4C|5|Bought used. Got it programmed and works great!
B0009IQXFO|3|This is an okay product - washes the car up well. However, I don't know what is truly &#34;unique&#34; and &#34;special&#34; about this product, as the car doesn't seem to take any longer afterwards to get dirty. Will continue to use for the sake of that I imagine using a special car formulated wash is better for the car and paint.
B00AN5UDBS|5|Installed perfectly on my SUV all you need to do your brake replacement
B0000DEW8P|5|We got a regular high chair, but it was bulky and the seat cover took a while to clean.  We saw the Reclining 4 Stage Feeding Seat at a friend's house and liked how easy it was to use when we visited their house, so we bought one for our son.  We like how easy it is to clean the chair and easy it was to transport to a friend's house if needed.  It is also inexpensive, so we were able to get the same one for our parents' houses.   <br /> <br />We have never used the reclining feature, so we can't comment on that.  We also did stop using it when our son turned 3, since he wanted to switch out of it. <br /> <br />I have recommended it to friends.
B00A32TSSU|5|Good product that was  properly packaged,  arrived in time and as described. I  Would definitely buy again from this vendor.
B001CF4UXU|5|a ok
B000X29VTG|4|Purchased this because I have a high resistance short somewhere in my 1996 Subruban.  It works well, but may not solve all your problems because it has a 20A limit. Unfortunately the 30A model does not read as low a current as does the 20A.  Too bad they can't combine the two models.
B00480GYSA|5|Glad I ordered these the difference was fantastic and there was no delay in the product getting here easy to install Will get some for my wifes Mercury Grand Marquis next . Great product.
B0041K310Q|1|Within two weeks a piece intended to stiffen the opening broke.  I am still using it, but trash falls out easily.
B005HA19GC|4|When I ordered these mats for the front of my 2011 Honda Odyssey van, I had been &#34;shopping&#34; around the internet and most of the other mats I looked at had been made of a flexible rubber material.  I just assumed that these also were that kind of material, but I was wrong.  They are a rigid vinyl/plastic material that has been molded to exactly fit in the vehicle that they are ordered for.  So while I was surprised that these were rigid, I was not disappointed with them and I do like them a lot.  I probably would order them again, knowing what I now know.  they completely cover the floor area, and have no holes in them so no water or other liquid (or dirt, etc.) can get through them onto the carpeting.
B00E16M1S8|5|Perfect fit on 07 Prius. Just remove the handle and fits perfectly in the battery bay. Exact dimension as original battery. I do see some people indicating it doesn't fit. Not sure what is the difference. Mine is 07 Prius with HID. Original battery was TrueStart S46B24R which matches this one perfectly.    It does take awhile to change (1 hour or so) compared to other batteries as there are variety of brackets, trim, and attachments to disassemble and reinstall. But well within capability of most DIYer. If you can change oil, you can change this battery. Here is a good link on the procedure    http://priusdiy.com/tutorials/interior/12vBatteryReplacement.html
B00BITJ2CE|2|At first the handle worked well, and this is not an OEM item.  The problem I'm having is the chrome handle has begun to stick out instead of remaining flush.  But at least it went in easily.
B000EBOOZC|3|not waterproof ,,but good for the price
B002MY6ZZG|4|I got his because I was worried about people trying the winch switch not knowing what they were doing. But it is larger than I thought it would be. It sticks out much further than I thought it would. It makes it so the winch hook is the furthest this out in front of my quad and pulling it into my truck bed it would hit my tool box. It takes up the entire width between my vertical fairleads. If it was exactly half the size all the way around it would be great for ATVs but it looks like it's sized for a full size winch fairlead.<br />If it didn't stick out so for, I would probably have kept it on. Yes, I could cut it down with a band saw, but... well I'm not sure why I didn't think of that until writing this... gotta go get the band saw out...
B00144D77E|5|This ign. switch was the exact replacement for my 1998 tracker super guide v16 boat, took about 5min. to install and works great so far.
B000CQOIVE|4|Does the job it is designed to do. I have 2 vehicles with this unit and installed them myself with little trouble.  You can spend a lot more, but why?
B006SYJYH2|5|The light arrived on time and fit perfectly. Simple to install. Cant go wrong with a Mopar part. Also purchased a Turn signal light (form Amazon) for my passenger side tow mirror on my 2010 RAM 3500. Mirror now working perfectly for a fraction of the price the dealer wanted
B003G0VW08|5|Best fitting mats imaginable. I'm sure my carpets will look like new when it comes time to sell my car. Well worth the extra $$$ to get these over generic 1 size fits all mats.
B000P7O5DG|5|This power supply runs cool and has reliably powered my little refrigerator for over a month. This product replaced another power supply that consistently overheated.
B002XM5G70|1|I bought this pump in July 2013.  I used it for a water wagon for my plants.  I used it perhaps 5 times last year.  The wagon/pump was stored in my barn when not being used.  I even tested the pump every few months, just to hear it pump.  Last week, I did the same test;  worked correctly.  Getting ready to use it today, tried it.  Silence.  Tested power;  all correct.  Tested connections;  all with continuity.  Pump has spontaneously fail, after a total of about 7 hours of use.<br /><br />Tried to return it as defective, since it is only 8 months old.  Cannot;  turns out that Amazon's return policy 'window' slams shut after 30 days.<br /><br />So, this type/model pump is clearly junk!!  My recommendation is to not purchase it from Amazon;  if you can purchase it from a company that actually stands behind their product, that would seem to be a safe thing to do.
B001DDMB2I|1|Came late and only has 10 pieces, not 14 as advertised.
B0013LDPD4|5|I LOVE THE WAY MY BIKE SOUNDS NOW.ALSO THEY LOOK GREAT.
B00B11SZEK|5|bought for my husband. for our work truck. It is a great step up bought two, one for each side.
B00HR3E0HC|5|The truck looks great. One complaint is the kit does not come with any instructions. But the end results were perfect
B000JZZ1Q4|5|good sound
B003D2BW0Y|1|This looked good when new.  Unfortunately after 2.5 years, it is corroded, and the chrome finish is peeling off.  It looks terrible now.<br /><br />The vehicle in question is my wife's car, which doesn't go off road or anything severe like that.  We do live in the Midwest, but the vehicle receives regular washes and exterior maint.  Overall, I am very disappointed with the durability of this product.  It should have lasted longer.  Now, I have to look for a suitable replacement.
B0064IU5FW|5|Diablosport tune is what I decided to install. It got me to 125mph with ease. I recommend this product but highly advise that you check with the main company website for authorized dealer list so they will honor your warranty. Spend the extra money to be legit.
B000GKD5NI|5|So happy I didn't spend $70 bucks on one of the comparable rear shades out there.  This one works flawlessly.  As long as you clean your window and you moisten the suction cups it'll stay put for as long as you don't mess with it.  What else can I tell you... it works.
B0050QLVS4|4|Again I have not yet tried them but they appear to be good heavy duty cables. Remains to be seen if the aluminum wires stand up to repeated use.  They appear to be what I expected.
B005P53TGC|4|Like other people say, the gloves are very good for the price. The knuckles are nice and hard/protective, they ventilate really well, and they look pretty awesome on your hands. the reason i give it a 4 is because they look a smidge cheap but they look about 80% well made. The leather isn't really all that leather but they do keep your hands nice and warm. I'm 17 and I got an extra large (because most gloves I fit an extra large), and for me at the present moment a large would've been perfect, but I am growing so they're probably perfect for me for future use too. The gloves don't feel cheap, maybe a little but not by much. They look and feel great, I would defiantly recommend these and I feel like they'll last me a good long while :)
B004MEDFFM|5|IT GOOD
B000VB6Z2U|4|The mats do what they are intended to do. Contain the water, snow, dirt and what ever you could pile on it! Excellent product. How ever i feel that they should be measured to the T because they have a little play and move around a bit thus causing some water or dirt to go thru the crack on the sides, specially the back. I dont know if Weatherteck would ever change that but its my opinion. Would I buy another set? ABSOLUTELY! By the way Amazon... Love your ontime delivery!
B0041QEU2I|5|Perfect!  Exactly as described.
B005CHFD62|3|The sticker came quick however it's not reflective at all it is just a regular sticker
B000CODG5U|4|I installed these this last week in my Chevy Avalanche hoping to make the effects of the coil spring rear suspension less noticeable.  These are good shocks, they are a tad bit shorter than the stock parts but do seem to work out okay.  They are of course easy to install and are quite a bit heavier duty than any standard OEM shock!  I installed them with a matching pair for the rear and it IS better, but they are not quite as HD as I had hoped for.  Even so, for the money, these are a good value, and for most applications will be as HD as anyone would normally ever need.  The rubber dust boots are an excellent idea to prolong the life of the seals.  Buy with confidence from Amaxzon!  Enjoy.
B003WWRDDA|4|This is a neat little tool; however, it has limited applicability because of its size.  It is well constructed, but a tad bulky to clamp onto your key chain.  To be honest, this would make a nice gift, and may be useful for very small jobs that are not torqued too tightly.  Overall size when collapsed is a little bigger than a silver dollar.  The tool is oblong shaped when closed.
B0039HBOL0|1|They rust pretty fast
B003WDDLTO|4|does what it is supposed to do, wire gauge is of good quality. easy to install on Suzuki boulevard, wire was just long enough.
B009DJJMZS|4|Fit was good. Thought the piece of rubber seal could have been better.
B006PAGJXQ|5|Very good product.  Very mobile and easy to operate.  It's worth the price.  It would be nice if the positive and negative cables were longer.  You have to make sure the charger is setting within a couple of feet of your vehicle.
B009NU9I4M|5|I seached all over this small town I live in and no one had this fuse. Went to a city about an hour away and thought I had found them but alas it was not the right fuse. I found this company on Amazon and I wound up ordered the wrong fuse. When I contacted TTL, it was very easy to get the correct fuse. I am not returning the other fuses, it is not worth the extra money and who knows I maybe able to use them somewhere else. I ordered the correct fuses Monday and received them on Thursday the same week. Installed the fuses and things are working again. Thank you TTL Corp. for you help and I will be ordering more soon.
B000KL73WW|5|Good fit!
B003NF34Y8|4|look like decent quality tools, have not had a chance to use them yet.
B001P2X4EQ|5|Well built and price is unbelievable for the quality. Exactly what i was going to fabricate for twice the money and time
B000F16F30|5|Great prouduct. Fit my Chevy conversion van perfect,which has a huge dash.Excellent quality.Color matched perfect. I also have one for my Porsche and the Wifes' Camry.
B000TN2BFA|1|Do Not Buy! doesn't work as intended, tried to help a stranded coworker tonight, and it failed us miserablely. the unit felt hot and after we opend to checked inside, wires and plastics are melting from its own battery heat, very disappointed. wish to get my money back.
B002807SF0|5|I purchased this set of 20 PLUS a set of 4 McGard Chrome Wheel locks for my vehicle.  Now, every lug has a wheel lock and every wheel has two different brand of locks.  I've taken them off several times.  Work great, even with impact wrench OR hand lug wrench.  Plus, having two brands of locks on each wheel makes me feel more secure (after finding my truck without wheels or tires on it one morning).
B007RKMV12|5|Oh! Man! These stickers are soooooo COOL! High quality and they sparkle in the sunlight. I put the small ones on my helmet. The big one hasn't found a home yet, but I'll find one 'cause it is really attractive! I've had a lot of compliments on the ones on my helmet, and plan to get more to adorn my tool box.
B00G258M1Q|5|makes it easier to close and also sturdies up the door alot
B00GHT86C2|5|Fit my 2006 Dodge Dakota perfectly. Works as it should. No issues with noise or clicking. Use caution and have patience removing the yellow secure tab. Remove the tab after you have it mounted. All my steering wheel controls work now.
B000C55T7W|5|They work and are a direct fit for my 2002 Pontiac Bonneville SSEi.  They hook to the existing lines.  For my case, my left shock line had fallen and melted so I had to patch the line, but I'm back on the road again and running good.  The ride is smooth and the handling fine.  I don't race so from that perspective I couldn't speak, but it is a butter smooth ride on the highway and comfy.  Thanks Monroe!
B00J00X3UU|5|As advertised. Mobil 1 is a great product.
B00684TAYY|5|This remote is great for an after market buy... it worked after the first program and hasn't failed me yet!!
B001V8U12M|5|There isn't a lot to say about it. It fits the nut on the scissor jack.
B002692308|5|I found the part I needed quick & easy, & the purchased was made easy too.<br />Also the arrival of my part was before the date on my order.
B000J4MUIC|5|Great product, I bought it for a spare.
B000QY67DE|5|They work awesome . A bit bumpy though
B0011N17KC|5|This was exactly what I was looking for. I should not have to say any thing more than that. Thanks.
B00W4B4PMW|1|Came with no instructions or rings to connect to key chain.
B00HKSNH7I|5|Really like it. Got it fast and very well made.
B00IKSJTK6|4|Looks/fits great.
B001QQ0BFQ|5|Purchased this to replace the original Shurflo RV water pump in a 1990 RV.  Figured if that one had lasted 20+ years than I'd stick with what was obviously a quality made product.  Hands down cheaper to get it here on Amazon vs picking one up at your local RV dealership.  Received it promptly a couple days after placing the order. The connections lined up perfectly to the original and had it installed and working in 15 minutes.
B001EP29AY|5|I read some of the reviews and was concerned about missing pieces.  When the box arrived it was in good shape.  I was able to assemble the carrier in about 15 minutes.  It was on the back of a Ford Expedition for 1500 miles.  When we arrived at the hotel I placed it in the up position.  I also purchased a lock for it.  This gave me enough piece of mind it would still be there when I woke up in the morning. Works great and the price was great.
B00FHSHUEO|5|Definitely five stars. This helmet is fantastic! Like I said about the Viking mesh jacket &#34; get hot easy&#34;. I will start sweating like a mad man doing anything when it is over 76°. The vents on this helmet really work great, even with shield closed! It really feels and looks great too! I would definitely recommend.<br />Also on a related note, I signed up for a free month of prime and I have been saving a ton on fast shipping!
B00WAORXWM|5|I put these on my girlfriends 2008 single cab Chevrolet Colorado and they look and fit great (with some effort if course). Some of the sticky tape is visible from inside the cab, but they perfectly and honestly make the truck look even better. Your best bet when putting these on is to line them up and start peeling the tape off and pressing it as you go.
B005ETCIO8|1|I was impressed at first, they are very bright and have a nice white color to them, but it doesn't last long.  I placed these in my liscense plate lights, and before a month had gone by, both of them were flickering.  I thought it might just be a defect so I replaced them with another pair from the 10 that I ordered.  I encountered the same problem in less than a month and a half.
B0049J91H6|2|This muffler popped up as an exact fit for a 2000 4 Runner SR5 3.4 L 5 speed manual. The input pipe from the catalytic converter does not have an O2 sensor mounting hole and the pipe is around 17&#34; too short. In the absence of availability of the proper adapter with an O2 sensor mount I was unable to use it without cannibalizing  the original unit on the vehicle an adding cost exceeding the value. Amazon, after calling customer service and objecting to a return shipping charge, graciously emailed a return shipping label and immediately credited the return when the label scan hit UPS's server.  The Walker 18901 appears to be the correct OEM interchange for the vehicle. Amazon beats the competition by about $9. Before ordering, you may want to measure the overall length of the part you are replacing. This 54681 is 40&#34; long. The Walker 18901 is 57&#34; long.
B002XLHH0U|1|I bought a kingdome antennna similar to this 2 years ago at half price ($750). Had it mounted on my RV and thought what a deal. Well after the installation I had to get it programmed for Dish Network for another $6o unless I wanted to buy another controller for %275.  So OK still a good deal. If you get Directv you don't have that procedure, the antenna has that in default. Now for the bad news. If it rains or heavy clouds goodbye signal. And now as of this week I can't get a signal in perfect conditions from many areas(sunny skies, no obstructions). I was warned about this antenna from other RVers and didn't listen. I've seen so many Rv's come into campgrounds with domes on their roofs and seen them put out dishes on tripods. So buy at your own risk!
B0032FVSNS|5|Good quality and quick delivery thank you very much price was just right.
B000IOLQ9W|5|Easy -- SUPER EASY --- to put on!  They look great and are really solid!  I considered the filler panels, but the chrome brackets looked great on my bike without them.
B002KQYIKK|1|I posted this for the sport/touring one also. I have had them both. These things are CRAP and DO NOT do what they say I have TRIED to use this on 4 different Harleys I own. EVERYONE of them have the same problem as described above. Fuel STILL squirts all over the tank. The only difference between using this and NOT using it is that the McCrap blocks your view of the inside of the tank so you have NO IDEA of when you are about to cover your tank with fuel. And for the record when the nozzle clicks off using the McCrap you can still get about 1/2 gal of gas more in the tank WITHOUT over filling it. So it doesn't even do that. Do it cheaply and BETTER in my opinion. Use a paper towel or old rag to keep fuel from running onto your paint then toss it away it works MUCH better. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product I threw mine away because I didn't want to ruin anyone elses day by giving it away.And before anyone says anything I follow directions EXACTLY. It just flat doesn't do what it says. PERIOD
B000M5YZKO|5|beautiful. works great!
B00BXPRH9S|5|Cool key chain for the Xterra enthusiast.  Gave it to a friend for a gift.  Good quality and cool looking key chain.
B00539L3VS|2|Quality n material is good. I changed because the color which shown is not matching with item received.
B00CFNLFPE|5|Good cleaning cloths.
B00AZPI0NE|1|Ordered 2.  One had the lens sealer oozing out of the lens, and sticky all over the light fixture.<br />The second looked like the lens was not even sealed.<br />Strong metal housing, but cheap plastic lens cover!!<br />Description of size is TOTALLY wrong!!<br />Real dimensions are 6.25 inches long, 1.75 inches tall, and 3 inches deep with bracket attached<br />The bracket comes with screws that are too long so they don't tighten all the way making the very heavy light housing always droop.<br />Save yourself the shipping costs and DO NOT BUY!!<br />I will be returning both lights.
B0046HPX4G|5|This isnt a very known brand but i got this for my 06 scion tc and it growls at high RPMs and hisses when u gas it. I had no problem with installing it. There is no Check Engine Light (CEL). No fitment issue with short ram.
B000S2MKSU|5|They seem to be heavy enough. Fit well, easy to adjust. Took about 30 minutes to install.
B00P80HP78|5|Great fit. Even covers those little side windows
B000C5UFI0|5|Installed this in a '99 Honda Civic EX.  It was a perfect fit and now my CEL is gone.  It did what I expected it to do.
B000XQ9MGE|5|This is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I had a phantom drain on my battery and every morning I would come out and find the battery dead.  This charger worked every time. I had to use it for about two weeks straight until I finally got the auto fixed. The price is reasonable and if you keep it charged it won't let you down,
B0000AYFTV|5|Even though I didn't use this product as intended (to wire a trailer front to back), I'm still very pleased with it. I only needed it to replace a 7 connector round plug with a 4 flat on my pop up camper. I just needed to patch into the camper's existing exterior light wiring. I'm sure I could have found a much shorter one for that purpose but in a time crunch, you get what you can get. Still, very pleased with the results of the product.
B00EFBYSLM|2|If this is new quality I can't imagine the old quality
B0068NDBUE|5|I recently bought a used VW Eos and after reading the online reviews, I checked the roof seals. They were very dry! However, with one 15 minute application of this product, the roof stopped creaking and the one small water leak I had was gone. This is definitely part of my routine maintenance to keep my roof and seals in good condition and its very easy to do yourself. VW recommends treating the seals 2-3 times a year, and I must say that it makes a huge difference, both visually and mechanically, in how the roof works. I highly recommend this product based on my experiences!
B0018PW15I|2|i have a rusty oil pan on my ford f-150..made a mess of my driveway and garage,,thought id give this a shot. ..applied 6 coats..last night..thought it helped but drove it just now, pan heated up and the coating melted off..ooozed down with the oil...stay away for this purpose guys..it wont stop not even a slight leak
B002E2WMVW|3|One of the bulbs went out the next day, lets give it the benefit of the doubt, because that side of the fog light is not that great it looked corroded but will see once I fix.
B004MJ01J0|5|The last time I bought plugs they were around $5 each, but oh well I'll spring for the high dollar ones this time I thought and see if they make a difference well they do my mileage went up from 17.8 to 20.5, now is that enough increase to justify the the price? you be the judge.
B004JKRO3I|3|It work, but you need to be really precise. I've gotten better over time with it, but still can't balance my race car tires with it... they'll vibrate over 90 mph.
B0076KBPNI|3|I'm not sure about this item. It worked most of the time. then once, completely stopped communication with the car. For not apparent reason. Never could complete my task. Other times worked like a charm. So I need more time to decide.
B007IKN17O|5|Works great
B009F2DDSA|3|We were not told this selenoid had it's wiring reversed from the original...and we burned up the 1st one.  We re-ordered and when the wiring was revesed...it worked perfectly!
B002KQG7TK|5|These chains are terrific for really bad weather.  The Z-chains go on very easily in a few minutes.  I now hae sets for all three of my cars, one set a hand-down from a 12 year old car--lucky it fit my new one.
B0081HO96U|5|I had been looking for a back window decal to celebrate Marathon running. I wanted something simple, minimal and understated. Most decals out there are either gaudy or have text or overpriced. After looking around, I decided to purchase this item as it fit my criteria. In person looks exactly as advertised and looks great on the back window. Make sure you read the included instructions as the decal is a &#34;transfer&#34; decal, so it involves two easy steps: the application and then the peeling. Other than that, I'm sure you will be satisfied with your purchase, specially since it's so affordable.
B0083J7K6M|5|I will be doing more business with u all item was as subscribed and it arrived before the estimated time
B0012ARRBW|5|Just what I needed.  Wire colors matched the trailers harness.
B003NI5GVO|5|We all know buying stuffs online is easy but when something went wrong on our purchased merchandise is a troublesome, First time dealing with Strong Arm, like you, I was wondering about &#34;what if&#34;. But two things were helped my decision of buying from Strong Arm were 1, made in America and 2, fulfill by Amazon. So I purchased a set of rear hatch props for my Lexus and when I received them, they were wrong and did not fit, I send an email and pictures of what were wrong and Strong Arm responded to my message  and send me another set within a week with an apology for causing inconveniently cost of my time. I've been in an Auto Industry business for over 30 years and have seen enough of them. It's not about who's right or who's wrong, it's all about How you handled it to make it right. Hat off to you Strong Arm. You guys are on my short list of &#34;go to places&#34;.
B000FGECW6|3|This unit is a replacement for the exact same unit that failed slightly over two years old.  Due to the hassle of trying to get it replaced under warranty, I replaced it.  If this unit fails less than 4 or 5 years in service, it will be replaced with another brand.
B000C7TZPM|3|Fuel tank looks just like the OEM.  The flanges are not quite bent in the right direction, so it rubs the frame in the rear.  Easily fixed by bending the flange upward like the OEM.  Tank DID NOT come with lock ring and o-ring.
B00DCQVW56|5|Awesome product as always,  just wish the Klim pants I bought them for had pockets in the right place so these would actually protect your knees instead of your shin.
B00650NY6G|3|This item is great and easy to put on, but only if your car door is at a 90 degree angle, with no bends. I have a 2014 Camaro; my door has curves which meant this product was useless for it. However, the product itself is still great
B007IOKSM6|1|Marketed as a cover for a VW Jetta key remote, it just doesn't fit.  The snap is in the wrong place and can't be fastened.  I'll end up returning it, which is a shame as the leather is gorgeous.
B004ULN610|5|Great Product; highest quality; on time delivery!
B001AIZ5HY|3|It works OK but not as easy as described, had to do it twice. Lights are still dull but better.
B008SEBQ2G|5|Item as described
B007GP2514|2|This decal won't last long on my truck. I sure won't be buying anything more from this seller.
B001J7CO02|5|This thing is BIG, loud and obnoxious. I LOVE IT! seams to be well built. It is ABS plastic so time will tell how it holds up. Great horn for the money if you have the room.
B000P0ZK1O|5|Looks to be simple to use and will be tested in the coming days.<br /><br />Quality castings that apear to be durable. only timw will reveal the longevity.
B007PJ5P7M|5|This is a great decal that I can put on my car's rear windshield to proudly proclaim my military service.  it seemed a little expensive, though. (Especially the shipping costs for it to arrive in a flemsy envelope that could have been paid for with a First Class stamp via the USPS.)<br /><br />I recognize that his vendor is probably a &#34;mom & pop&#34; operation in Smalltown, Alabama so the price will likely be higher.  However, readily availabile technology (hardward and software) should be able to easily produce these types of decals at a much lower cost with little waste.
B000X1XKO4|5|This product works great to keep the coins nice and neat in your car. Easy to take the coins out.
B00D42AFS8|5|Cool little gadget! I got this for my motorcycle so i could charge my phone while riding and have the led light and jump start as a backup. It will jump a car with ease! My jump box i got from harbor freight tends to struggle but this little thing works well. The led is super bright also! I just wish it had a compact carry case for it but still worth the purchase.
B00280974A|5|NICE
B00QXE4Y9U|3|a light weight compared to original, it worked out ok. i forgot to replace three nuts on the motor and bended the track,other than that i have no complains
B0071BS0CQ|5|Great I have no issues, and learned how easy it is to do what I needed.  I am now selling mine, all I did was switch the right mirror out which was not broken in any way what so ever, and took the left cover because mine was cracked from a tiny rock.  I now have my left mirror with a blue cover in excellent condition, and the left brand new mirror with no cover for sell.
B00DSJ25YE|5|Excellent antenna.  Thanks
B0010GJ7FW|5|Very happy that I purchased this item. Price, delivery time, all very great.
B00Q3COXLG|2|Didn't fit my backseat
B000C18Q4Y|2|Just installed these on my 2001 Jeep Cherokee that had factory equipped daytime running lights. These lights do not work in that mode. Already chucked my old lights so I guess I'm stuck with these ones.
B000RH0KPQ|5|I bought this to replace the rear pads on my 2003 CR125R dirtbike.  They installed effortlessly and seem to stop me just as well as the stock pads did.  I've used them a few months of light riding and they don't look worn at all (so they should last a while).
B006XKG00K|3|I did receive the package of clear, car door edge guard on time, well packaged and easy-to-open. I laid the strip of door edge out on the floor under a large oriental carpet and left it there for about 12 days to warm up and to straighten out the curls / twists / bends from the packing. After that I used a tape measure to get the approximate length needed for a door edge on our 2008 Subaru Forester - (Silver in color). I washed / dried and then cleaned off the door edges on the car. I came into the house and pulled out the required length from under the carpet and cut it off with a little to spare (better to cut long than to regret later). I used a plastic, thin tip tool from my Astro Pneumatic Tool Kit # 4524 to open the U-Shape of the edging slightly and started to apply the edging to the car door edge. I bent the edging backward to assist in opening the U-shape and applying the edging to the door edge. I used a hair dryer on low heat and constantly moving to assist in navigating door-edge bends and curves. It all went well EXCEPT that I would get a COLORED door edge guard strip next time as with the Clear one is able to see the adhesive which detracts a bit from the cosmetic appeal. That feature is the reason for my rating of three (3) Stars. Otherwise I would have given it 4 to 5 stars.
B00EPRBVS4|5|Fits my 2014 pathfinder nicely
B003O0W69G|5|Fit perfectly
B001WB4SYU|3|I bought these as a gift. From what I read they fit small so I bought one size up. They fit fine but are really stiff. I think they are supposed to be, but he won't wear them because of that so I can't really say much else about them. So just putting my two cents in for the &#34;one size bigger&#34; vote.
B00537FIRU|5|Just as others have indicated, the instructions and on-line videos made installation very easy.  Dropping the exhaust was the most difficult part.  Also, for those of you with 2014 Explorers with the factory tow loop, there is one additional bolt that must be removed to free the toe loop support.  It is the same size as the others and is on the side of the support.  No mention of this bolt anywhere, but it is clear it must be removed.  The hitch then fits on exactly as the instructions indicate.  A solid hour with help from a friend is all you need.  I was able to do all of this work without raising the vehicle at all.  A strap from spring to spring supports the exhaust perfectly, I used a ratcheting adjustable cargo tie down.
B001O03QT2|5|I drive a 2001 Dodge Neon and finding the replacement part for the washer pump was murder.  Autozone and O'Reilly both tried to sell the universal replacements which would change everything and require wiring.  This is an exact replacement product and thank God for that.  Such a time saver.
B000CFS028|5|I have a 2005 Toyota Sienna and several children.  I have, at times, taken a load of Boy-scouts and equipment in the car for a campout.  For big loads I attach a \\"Dual-Port\\" mounted cargo box that hangs aft of the rear bumper. It holds a lot but drops the rear too much and I get cars flashing me wiht their bright lights. The parts arrived sooner than I expected and the contents looked just like the add showed.  I had little trouble installing the bags, although they are rather stiff and require some strength to push through the spring coils.  Unlike the instructions, I chose to route the air line out the hole in the top of the spring perch rather than the bottom which bounces along with the wheels.  They work great, levelling the car as needed in a few seconds.  It is also a little stiffer and much less sensitive to the added load and bumps.  It rarely scrape the hitch now.
B003LMBZKI|5|Nice Quality and feels great on my head.
B005MZXCSU|5|This is a great size magnet and looks like it will hold up well. I love that it's red, white and blue and not just yellow!
B000630HW2|5|looks great on my edelbrock carb
B008BRJ5FA|5|Fit perfectly in a 2010 Dodge Caravan SXT fog light
B00NEJT0VO|3|I was really impressed on how authentic it looks to the OEM's. The color and the shapes are very well matched. 
B000BZI4JS|5|Bought this for 1990 F150. The wiring was longer than needed and it comes with some zip ties to tie up the extra. A good choice for a semi universal O2 sensor.
B000Y87R4K|4|no comment
B007A0LDTK|2|the only thing metal is the screws.  I paid extra to get a metal latch only to find out they don't make a metal one.  however, the plastic one fit perfectly.
B000QUZ572|4|2006 Dodge Ram 2500 fit perfectly.
B000C5BYHG|4|I had my mechanic install it when having other work done. The left button seems a little soft but it looks and feels great. I should buy one for 10 years from now when this one wears out.
B000V7H3Q6|5|Item was shiped fast and nothing was damaged and so easy to install that i didnt even look at the intructions. The wireless remote makes it simple to change colors but only works like up to 8 feet away and interfers with my remote for my car i guess same frequency and i cant open my car when they are on but product is very bright for leds and already got multiple compliments for the first day having them on.
B00JIEX722|5|-Brightest 194 LEDs I've owned so far out of the last 10 I've purchased<br />-Seems just as bright if not brighter than BMW's and Audis's license plate lights<br />-Very bright white, was hoping for a little hint of blue though<br />-Product seems to be very good quality<br />-Would recommend & purchase again
B000XU9GLQ|5|Did the job cutting through two someone thick pieces of aluminum on a bike trailer I was trimming down, got through about an hour of cutting and still looks good.
B00892OFJ8|4|good
B000DLBIGG|5|Easy to install. Great sound. Just the horn I was looking for! Installed on my F-150 and people get out of the way when I blast my horn.
B001AFJP8W|5|Nice little emblem, came way sooner the  expected, and works good. Good little touch to your car or where ever it's being put
B004X2W8L0|5|Happy with decal
B000O5EW9G|5|i used the bucket to transport some cut flowers and it woeked perfectly.
B00RD982MO|5|I smoke in my home office. Have tried 2 options to handle the odor: True Air Room Odor Eliminator (electrical fan) & ZEP Odor Eliminator (spray). True Air did not seem to do much. ZEP was helpful but, after the fragrance faded, smoke odor still was detectable. Ozium is quite remarkable! I am AMAZED at how this gel takes care of the odor. I ordered 2- 1 for the study & 1 for adjoining room. Am VERY pleased with the results.
B00IUWM59O|3|Very good concept and at a great price... BUT when I received mine the screen was defective. This isn't a huge deal however it was one of the selling points for me. Contacted Amazon and as always they made it right!<br />As with anything else, you get what you pay for. I am all about giving these lesser known company's the benefit of the doubt. There are always hidden gems out there!
B00AV8HSA6|5|Thank you
B000C5CEKC|5|I got this for my dad's 2013 Toyota Tacoma. It fits like OEM and now his gas tank is secure.
B00A0BAYR8|4|As expected and working so far.
B0009IQWXW|5|Ordered this for my aging Isuzu Rodeo. Exactly the right size. A good bargain, too!
B005C91CU6|5|The driver side door on my 2007 Camry did not lock or unlock with the electronic door lock or fob buttons.  Intermittent problems, multiple chirps, other doors worked.  Same symptoms with 2 fobs.  Took to dealer who thought it was the fob battery!  I was surprised that it worked well for a week after that.  I suspected it was the Door Lock Actuator.  Much less expensive than OEM, but essentially the same product.  It was not too hard to install.  About an hour, and I didn't know what I was doing.  I did not remove the window.  Two challenging aspects:  1) finagling the new and old parts around the window track.  (If you move it down toward the bottom of the door there is more room, and 2) getting the lock bar into the hole on the actuator.  Maybe there is a trick to that one, but I just spent 15 minutes working on that.<br /><br />Buying from Amazon was a breeze.  I had the part next day!
B0024E6QX0|5|I bought two of these this to block out light (I like to sleep in) and it does the trick. Also it does a GREAT job of insulating out the heat in summer as well as keeping heat in for those winter camping trips.<br /> Very snug fit so you don't even have to use the Velcro tabs that come with it. Blends in well with my RV ceiling.<br /><br />Hint: Crack open the vent about 1 inch  in the summer to let the heat escape and save the plastic vent from getting too hot.
B000GU2DEA|4|These lights are OK for some local light at night, but I buy them so car folk can see ME during the day, they are very good recognition lights.  Easy to add to the bike... I leave them on ALL the time so they don't last a REAL long time and they are a bit expensive... but worth it.  I can see them see me and that is reassuring on a bike.
B000M8NZ70|4|I am skeptical about products that make claims like this but I really did not want to throw this car away for scrap as the repair is more than the car is worth. The local \\"Pick & Pull\\" auto junk yard offered $500.00. If the car was in good running condition it would be worth about $3500.00. Ford Windstar has a known problem of warping heads and this was my problem. As a last ditch effort I purchased this product, followed the instructions to the letter and to my amazement, It worked and worked well. As of this review, I have put about 5000 miles on the engine and it's holding up just fine. Can't say how long it will last but this is much better than junking the car which is in great shape otherwise. Four stars just for being such a hassle to take engine parts off and on.
B005SMUORO|5|IT GAVE ME JUST THE RIGHT TOOL, THAT I NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE JOB OF CHANGING OUT THE O2 SENSOR. LOVED  THE WAY  IT MADE THE JOB LESSS TIME CONSUMING. THANKYOU, JAMES TRUMBULL JR.
B008720YYA|5|Thing works perfectly and at half the price I could find for it anywhere else in the world.  Sure beats paying Ford $1200 for a whole new FICM!!!
B008BYQQW8|5|I am 5'7&#34; on a Vulcan 900 with a lower than stock Corbin seat and lowered suspension. The wind coming over the windshield only hits the top of my head when I sit stait up. If you are taller get the bigger one or wear a helmet.<br />When you install it snug the bolts. After a short ride tighten them all the way as it will conform to the fairing and loosen. Kepp the provided Allen wrench with you just in case.
B009HX77VQ|4|I'll give a 4 out of 5 stars, as the fit and finish is nice and the finished installation fixes the issue. Tailgate now operates smooth as silk.<br />Although, this kit does NOT include replacement backing plates, like other kits appear to provide, which would add needed rigidity! It took me about 3 1/2 + hours to do this job on my 2003 wrangler at a buddy's auto repair shop with his mechanics tools. My jeep is clean and has never been off road.<br />Some very important points to consider BEFORE doing this job:<br />1. The factory installs the weak aluminum hinges while the vehicle is in primer, then paints over everything. Consider having a can of primer and matching paint to paint the body under new hinges. After you scrape off and clean the body from aluminum oxidation crud build up, left by the original hinges. You may wish to have a clean painted surface to mount the hinges to.<br />2. Have &#34;easy out&#34; bits and an air hammer ready to remove the original, frozen Torx bolts. On my jeep, 7 of 8 Torx bolts and a hardened &#34;easy out&#34; bit broke during removal.<br />3. Carefully consider purchasing a different brand/kit with stainless rectangle brackets provided, which go behind the body and the new Torx bolts screw into them. The bottom hinge bolts are tough to get to and a new inner bracket would have been awesome. The factory brackets are small and flimsy and may not survive drilling out the old Torx bolts which break upon removal.<br />4. Have a couple milk crates with some books on top to ready, to prop up the tail gate. Have a buddy raise and lower the tail gate up and down as you line up the holes.<br />5. Replace 1 hinge at a time, start to finish. Then, do the next bracket. This helps maintain tailgate alignment.<br />All in all this was a royal pita job, that I could have not done in my driveway with hand tools. Well worth doing to add value, life and utility to your Jeep.<br />The finished product is nice, but have to knock it down 1 star forlack of brackets and incomplete directions.<br />Hope this helps fellow jeepsters.
B003WSNYXW|4|Luv it but smaller than expected.<br />It's for a good cause which is more important.<br />I will refer this item to friends.
B002R0KPGA|5|Perfect fit and Easy to install !! Great replacement!
B005JU5TUM|5|I have these on all of my vehicles.  They work great and last a long time.  For the extra expense I save the cost of replacing the wiper blades more frequently.  I have one vehicle in the Pacific Northwest and one in Florida - both have these wipers and in both cases the wipers hold up remarkably well in the significantly different climates.
B0067Q7ML6|5|Would definitely get this item again. Fit is perfect and I like the OEM attention to detail and overall quality.
B005DLLVMW|4|It's a foot for a hitch...  what can I say.  It works, won't rust and suits the purpose just fine!
B000FQ0E6E|5|Not much to be said other than all the components were a perfect fit to my specific vehicle.  All good quality parts and much cheaper than you could piece them together from an auto parts store.  Was a little nervous about quality and accuracy but everything went in perfect and my Jeep runs great...
B000KXLR5E|5|I use this product on O-rings, kitchen drawer nylon rollers and many other items that require long-lasting lubrication. It is especially safe to use on plastic because it does not contain harmful petroleum distillates.
B000WJX47A|5|Perfect fit very slick look great protection for the striker or the vapor.
B007J4K5Z0|5|great absolutely love it
B003V9L05G|5|Bought this to find out what was wrong with my car. I just got done replacing a head gasket on a 2005 Neon and put it back together only to find that it was running like crap. Went to a website that JustAnswers questions about all kinds of stuff and the guy had me check a lot of things. Everyrhing pointed to a valve leaking but I had a valve job done and the head machined and figured that would be impossible. He recommended I get a vacuum gauge and after a couple days, I chose this one. The instructions that came with it are amazing. They say exactly what the problem is based on what the needle does. It was right on too, confirming what I didn't want to be the case but at least I knew so I could fix it. The machine shop did a terrible job grinding the seats and the brake cleaner I put in the exhaust port poured out of the valve instantly. Took the head back and had him fix it and it ran perfectly. Awesome tool.
B00BQA3WW6|4|it cleans but not to a great extent<br />its good if you keep good care of your car and give it a monthly wipe down<br /><br />if you need excessive cleaning done then i think it wont do the trick<br /><br />price is great though, does the job, all in all i was looking for a mild cleaner and this is exactly that
B00N3N1HIK|4|Nice light
B0041LN1L4|5|This is a must for living in New York City where people play bumper cars just to park. Protects my front bumper of my 2013 maxima.
B002Z64QO8|5|This made our snowbird trip from NH to Florida a breeze and no wrinkled clothes!  Very strong and well made!
B000ZIZCVE|5|Bolted right on. Love the looks and sound!!
B0087HWYW0|4|Looks good in package.  Have not put it on truck yet. Has not got above 20 degrees here.
B002CP24FA|5|I had an older version of this tire inflator and it saved me right after my husband got it for me.  I drove into the mountains for a hike and returned to find my truck tire flat.  I hooked up the inflator to the cigarette lighter--and, yes, it took quite a while--but I was able to drive out and home.  That made me a believer.    These new versions are much better in that they are self-contained and easier to use.  They're also useful around the house for bike tires, etc.  Highly recommended.  Buy them for your family, especially if you live out in the country where you don't have a filling station on every corner.
B004Y49FJU|5|good product thank you
B000CIOA0Q|5|simple to use dead on
B009PDCJKW|5|it was excellent
B001HRB3PQ|5|Great part. I hate when car manufactures put such a time bomb into beautiful cars. So much hassle to replace $5 part!  I was ashamed when my BMW would leave oil spots everywhere I go. So, Valve cover gasket, CCV and this one and your BMW will be &#34;spotless&#34;
B00476VYDU|5|Gig'em love it and on the car proudly.
B000BXKYYI|5|I've gone through several gas and diesel cans for my tractors because of failing and slow pouring nozzles. Seems the government regs cause companies to redesign these simple gadgets so that the new nozzles are never compatible with an older can. Also it's easy to spill a lot of gas with the new &#34;no-spill&#34; nozzles since they malfunction frequently while taking a very long time to slowly pour.<br />This Giant Funnel solves my problem. I just remove the nozzle and pour a 5-gallon can into the Funnel. It's very fast and no spills. Saves me time, arm strain, fuel, and exposure to the spills and fumes that result from real life use of the  so-called &#34;no-spill&#34; cans.
B003SRK0O8|3|The front bow tie was a little more difficult to set. I had to use an exacto knife to trim it after adjusting. My advice is to take your time when applying it.
B000VUC51G|5|I have read the reviews of some people getting a bad mat but I guess I was one of the lucky ones. Item was at my door within 3 days and in perfect condition with the cut outs for the D rings. Couldn't be happier with the mat or the price!
B000KPYIGW|5|Very happy with the product, they were a cinch to install quickly.  Only frustrating thing was the first set arrived damaged, and it took about 4 weeks to get a replacement. The items interfere with the auto up function of my window, and make a clunk noise when rolling up, but I'm assured this goes away as the item settles in more. They look great.
B00MG687JW|1|Took it on a 4 day moto camping trip. Fully charged it before departure. Plugged my note 4 in for overnight charging. Woke up to discover note 4 charged only 65% and Nektec completely drained. Thought it was user error so I fully charged again. Same thing. Charged phone to 67% and was fully drained.<br />Too bad. Wanted to like this unit. Great concept, nice package. I'm sure I just got a bum unit. Maybe a little more research.
B000CGFIT0|1|The plug is on the wrong side of the unit! It hits the intake manifold and can not be installed!  It DOES NOT fit a 2003 Explorer Sport with the 4.0.  Either they have their part interchange wrong, or somebody in quality control was asleep when this was built. pay close attention to the plug direction when buying one of these.
B000NWA8HU|4|as original - no more flickering dash lights.
B00393NESK|5|Great....fast delivery...thanks
B000C3ZD5W|5|They fit my 2002 Land Cruiser perfectly. The box contains everything in the picture, no washers. Great ride quality, not too firm or soft.
B00P2SYBJG|5|Fit perfectly. Exactly as described.
B0002KKTFO|5|Works great so far.  Previously owned grease guns always leaked.  this one is solid for a good price.  Well worth the money
B00U318WH4|5|Works great!
B000BZG96I|5|Not much to say except that you can't beat the price. I didn't need any O2 sensors at the moment, but it being a VW product, it's always good to have a few spares on hand!
B002KIHHNI|5|Fast shipping just as stated, pleasantly surprised!
B007J5IDXK|4|I really prefer the individually wrapped wafers to the open option - the scent stays concealed longer and seems stronger when removing.  They last generally a few days before the scent begins to fade, but even after a week and getting into my truck when it's been in the sun I can get a slight hint.  Another bonus is the small size of the wafer that can be concealed better than the canned air freshener or dangling items like the trees.  Wild Cherry gets more positive compliments from some of the other scents I've used.
B00N6ZQFP0|5|Nice.
B00ERIA8XU|5|My husband loves it.
B004IXH6I4|5|Works great
B00590WCUM|5|Just ordered.  I hope it fits and the wiring is not too complicated.  Thanks
B000P19Z5K|5|EXCELLENT!  Enhances the look if my bike. GREAT PRICE! Perfect fit!
B00BKNPN8A|5|This fixed the problem thanks.
B00A3KNA5O|4|This looks and works great. Lid is tight so it is not easy to open, but then... no odors come out in car. Holder works well. Sometimes I wish it were a bit tighter, but it does the job.
B00AAQRW1E|5|these are good lights. im replacing my turn signal lights with these. looks better then the original boring dull lights
B001VD3HW8|4|LED
B00W6J0SJ6|4|Great product awsome fast very fast shipping.  Was so fast i came home and said what the hell is this lol
B0024NM37E|5|Shipped on time and securely. Installed easily and work great!
B000FPYFBA|5|Just what I needed, just like the original, only better, On a 1984 CJ7
B003978QGQ|5|Great product and shipping was really fast
B005VJGY7I|5|it fit well on my 2008 Pontiac torrent  with no problems and its real genuine taillight including original lights thanks
B001DKQZ9Q|4|Used this to change my transmission fluid.<br /><br />Unfortunately it doesn't screw onto a Redline bottle, but it worked anyway.<br /><br />Took a LOT of pumping to transfer the fluid, but this might be due to it not screwing on.
B005VMKOSU|4|Very sharp motorcycle sneaker.  More protection than the average leather high-top bball shoe but not much.  BOA lacing system is very cool.  4/5 Stars because one seam has already come undone,  barely worn.  Order 1/2 size smaller than normal,  this worked perfect for me.
B00C5T2ME6|5|Great, long lasting gaskets!
B001CF3N10|1|Same issue - doesn't fit my 2011 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Unlimited.  It's far too short.  How do they not know this?
B000V5UKQI|4|very easy to install took maybe 30 min. sounds good did a very good job at opening up the motor and throttle response. A must have.
B000C2QRUI|4|I was surprised that the oil in the 57101 was compatible with both R-134a and R-12. Used. 7.5 oz of PAG-100 with UV for R-134 though. Compressor runs really quiet. (1988 Ramcharger 5.2L)<br /><br />Addendum: A year later it is still holding well in this Southern Louisiana heat. Still running the R-134A and the PAG-100.
B00E1SM4GU|5|I was very happy with the breaks and pads. They showed up in 3 days.<br />and they were exactly what I needed for the right price.<br />very pleased.<br /><br />Thanks Callahan
B004EL4MLY|5|So handy to have. Actually, I use the small flat-head to clean my nails more than I use the rest of it. BUT, I can say I have used the large and small phillips-head for numerous things as well.<br /><br />Very well constructed, and I bet it'll last a long time.
B00567VRTA|3|One big thing you need to know about this kit is that the neon wires are really short. If you are getting this kit, i recommend buying an extension cord which is sold on here for 7 bucks a piece. I have an 05 Ram single cab and I put the receiver box under my hood. When I did that, the side neon wires wouldn't reach to the hood and obviously the rear can barely reach. I could of put the box under the truck but I don't think it's safe and it doesn't say anything about weather proof. Another downside to this kit, it doesn't come with any mounts. I used cable ties which is cheap so it's not a big deal to me. Beside that, I love this neon. It's bright and the multi-color function is cool. The remote made it easier to turn on/off the neons. This company could of done better by extending the wires. By extending the wires, you can go around objects like the muffler and reach the rear bumper. It makes the installation much easier, cheap because you don't need to buy any extension cord, safer so you can avoid objects that will ruin your neons/wires like the muffler because it gets hot. The power and brake wires are short as well but if you have speaker wires, those will work to extend it. I basically pay 60 bucks for this neons. 3 extension cord and the neon kit itself. You can get better deals somewhere else but oh well, that's the only thing I don't like about the kit. Everything else is amazing. If you know how to install it right, your neons won't fall off. People on here is ridiculous.
B00H8PC7DI|1|If you have a Ram truck that used to have a hood ornament this will not fit it. The studs are not far enough apart to fit in. You could fit the studs in one of the small holes and the large hole and attach it with a few extra washers, but then the other small hole will be visible and make it look like a cheap add on. It looks nice though and if you have a truck where you have to drill your own holes it would work ok I imagine. But seriously, what moron at that company thought of making a replacement hood ornament that wouldn't fit a truck that had an original ornament? All it would have taken was about half an inch more metal at the base and the studs to be spaced farther apart and it would have fit perfectly. How many times have they had these things returned because someone thought it would fit then it wouldn't. What a waste of time and money on their customers part and their part.
B004GWJ1ZI|1|All I got was a filter and a hose clamp,sent it right back. Not what was described at all no air box or aluminum cover nothing. Go with K&N cold air intake kit.
B0082ACB8E|3|Decent cover and easy to install but front plastic nut broke after about a month.
B006GFO9WI|5|It came promptly!  Looks great, fits well, keeps the sweat away! Keeping me cool while I work.  This is a great product.
B000CIKJMY|5|Item as described, fast shipping. Thanks.
B00H58W59Y|4|Worked perfect!
B00H29LGXM|5|Bought to help out my jeep when riding on the trails. It does a good job when ever i need an extra boost.
B0012UO00S|5|Works great and as advertised.  Very easy to use.  My AEM Bruteforce filter was so dirty, that my truck through a MAF code.  Bought this, cleaned it up real well and all is good.  I recently moved from SF to the central valley and it's way too dusty here. Have to clean often, and Amazon has it reasonably priced compared to other vendors.
B0016KTNLK|5|I got this as a gift for my boss who just bought a Mercedes. He absolutely loved it, said it fit perfectly into the cup holder, very sharp looking without being 'too' showy.<br />GREAT MUG!!
B00C7Y3NX8|3|Didn't fit as expected
B00B2AFO4E|5|Fit perfect. My whole jeep is rough country. All of their products fit great and work great. Prices are affordable.
B000C57YY8|5|EXACT fit for my 2001 Ford Excursion 2WD
B00026Z3E0|5|I needed a second pair of jack stands and these fit the bill perfectly.<br /><br />I use them to support fairly light cars (S2000 and Miata) but so far they have held up nicely. The quality is great with the welds looking strong.<br /><br />They are very stable and the locking pin works very well to secure the support portion of the jack stand.<br /><br />Overall a quality product that I highly recommend.
B000C6IXPQ|1|I had a major issue with a Purolator filter when I changed my oil yesterday.  Model number is L1447 for my 2006 Toyota Camry.  I had used this filter several times, in the past, for this car with no issues.<br /><br />I changed the oil as normal, wrench tightened the filter and plug and put the oil in.  I checked under the car – no leaks.  So, I started the car.  My oil light came on so I shut the car down. I got out and every bit of oil had come out into the driveway.  4 quarts makes quite the mess.  I thought maybe I had not gotten it threaded correctly, so I took the filter off and reattached it.  I checked the drain plug, it was fine.  So I put oil in again.  Same thing, except now there are 8 quarts in the driveway.<br /><br />I went to Advance, where I had purchased the filter and took the filter with me (plus the old one I had taken off the car to start the oil change).  They were very helpful.  They confirmed, as I had on Google, that I had the right filter for the car and said it must be defective.  They gave me a new on – a PL1447.  I tried it and it worked fine.<br /><br />I have an enormous mess on my hands.  8 quarts of oil plus 40 lbs of cat litter (and still may need more.  Plus: extra purchased oil,  a set of ruined clothes, a major need for a car wash and the likelihood that I will need to have someone pressure wash my driveway.  I have reached out to Purolator for some reimbursement.
B00590TS2W|5|Great product
B001GMX99K|5|I'm not using the connector that much but it's nice to have when you need it. I usually mount bicycles to my trailer hitch and decided to buy this product on a whim. Well it was well worth it. I put it on my 2010 Honda Odyssey. I found the Youtube videos by [...] very helpful in putting the connector in. It was very simple and took me 10 minutes after watching the video 3 times. The instructions looked okay, but I like watching someone do it. Additionally, I went to my local Lowes and tested the connector on trailer they had to sell in their open lot. What can I say, I'm cheap. Excellent product. Thanks
B000FPYEUC|5|After reading a ton of reviews on Tire Deflators I chose Staun's Tire Deflators.  I have to say their product is great!
B003V57NUQ|1|Just got the product open the box and all the screws are laying on the bottom of box not in bags (loose) and no instructions on how to put it together.
B000FQ7L92|5|Only complaint is that there were a few paint chips on it when I opened package. But other than that it is a solid piece.
B00NX7BZNS|2|The visors were not the correct size for the front windows. They were too long and I had to return them.
B00029WZU2|5|I bought it to fit a DDM works intake on a 06 Mini Cooper S. It fit.
B001DKTG0G|5|It got rid of the annoying crunch when shifting from first to second. The transmission now feels like it did when new.
B003YMTJ9O|5|Great deal
B0041RPGQ6|5|love it. warms up before the car does and it is sooo comfy. perfect for Colorado mornings and late nights
B0019IL7MC|5|Excellent replacement for oem wires at more than half the cost of box auto stores. Perfect fit for my daughters 2001 Jetta. Part was a prime purchase and arrived in two days. Only complaint I have has nothing to do with the product but amazons mobile app. It is difficult to look up parts for vehicles so I had to use the desktop version to ensure these were the correct ones.
B000C1LLNC|1|These brakes are horrible. Put on my Nissan Altima, brake dust everywhere not to mention I now I have to harder than I ever have to brake now. They also sqeek and I've hade then for almost a year now.
B00NX7C6TA|4|I love the product. I wished the tape was a little stronger but overall love them.  I received them very quickly.
B008KZ0FY8|5|Well worth the cost and wait. Due to the location of the wire harness this is a must.
B000BSYZQQ|5|Have been pleased with the quality of these Over-The-Wheel Tie Down.  Not much to say other then they easy to put on and were a great price.  Glad I puchased them as the Tie Downs that came with my Carson Tow Dolly were for large tires.  I wouldn't buy anything from Carson Trailer again as they should provide the right size Tie Downs for the Car your towing.  Safety concern!!
B004C444UC|4|These are made of supple leather and extend a good distance past the palm area to deflect the wind over your jacket sleeves. My fit we'll enough but I definitely could feel the seams inside the fingers. Not to irritating, but my hands do get fatigued if driving longer distances. Get what you pay for. Good gloves to for cold short distances.
B00540UY1G|5|easy to install. works great. and it was cheaper then the dealer by about 10 dollars.   yes i would buy again but i only need one.
B000XUC95Q|1|I got this product and it didn't work with my cell phone, PC, and also with my PlayStaion 3. I contacted the seller, and they did nothing. I have wasted my money for nothing.
B000BNZPT2|5|Looks and fits perfectly on my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500. I let my 10 year old son replace the latch for me. He did it with no problems and it works great.
B001B77XIS|3|Noisy and seems to run constantly, even in cold weather.
B001MYU9PE|4|I got this Charger for Christmas and used it for the first time today.  Its a good sturdy charger and easy to use.  Gives battery Charge status, volts, and test alternators..However, it doesn't test the CCA's..being a mechanic that's the number 1 thing I need to know.  Oh well..still a good charger I'm sure it will get a lot of use.
B000COCTWG|5|Good DOT legal wrangler lights<br />nice and bright good pattern<br />brighter than the old ones, clean light.
B001AYSX9K|1|I have a mazda cx9 with a huge windshied. Despite saying these were for large windows, it didn't fit. Returned them.
B000CDCDFK|5|This was for the right wiper on a Acura RDX. Installation was simple and wipes better than OEM and any other brand out there
B001S8GWZA|5|I purchased this muffler for my son-in-law for him to install on his 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche Z71 5.3L V8. He had already replaced the original equipment catalytic converters. He tows a 27 foot travel trailer and has made a multitude of enhancements to the Avalanche to improve it's performance, towing ability and gasoline mileage. His goal has been to reduce as much as possible the back pressure of the exhaust system on the engine. Early on he is very pleased with this latest improvement. The muffler also provides a pleasant &#34;bubbling&#34; sound without being overly loud.
B001HATY36|5|Great lock. +++
B00513G82U|4|exceeded my expectations however the paint job on it is horrible. I drilled the holes for the rack and ended up peeling some of the paint off. Other than that, for the money it is a fantastic buy. 92 shadow
B00D1CQVIY|5|awesome product, fast shipping
B000X1WMP2|5|Got a a L/XL pair for myself and a S/M pair for a friend. They're true to size and they do keep you warm a bit longer. Much better than the cycle gear brand that tore in a few weeks.<br /><br /> However, I'm in California where we ride year round and once you get below about 45 there's no helping it with any of these liners. They'll keep you warm for maybe an extra 10min on the freeway but after that no good. That being said I'm pretty sure that's a fault with all glove liners, only so much they can do. If you ride in colder whether for longer times you'll have to get actual heated gear
B003TXH6XE|4|Bought these to replace faded OEM flares.  I like the look and the fact that they cover more or the tires.<br /><br />Like everyone else has mentioned, taking off the OEM is where most of your time will be spent.  Why Jeep decided to use those backing for screws I have no clue.  They work but what a pain to remove.<br /><br />Install when fairly easy.  Line up new flares with existing holes.  Wish they would have put more mounting slots for the front though.  Oh and it could have been just my package, but there were no instructions included.  Good thing I can look at something and figure it out.  And the cut or outline does not follow the OEM so there will be old mounting lines from your old flares.  I'm gonna try to remove them with some wax.<br /><br />When all was completed, the flares felt pretty solid.  Covers my 31x10.5 R15 quite well.  Maybe a little too well.  May have to go to 32 or 33 to fill it out a little more.
B000C7UJNE|4|right price, good product
B00K9B9MFO|5|Excellent---!
B005C5V3T0|5|My boyfriend just bought a 2012 Jeep Wrangler and LOVES Captain America. He saw your tire cover and flipped out! I was wondering if you'll be putting anymore on Amazon cause I would love to buy one!!<br /><br />Thank you.
B0000AZ68O|3|Wexbar Wrap-Around left marine tail light lens, 003372 is a quality replacement lens for the Wesbar tail light. Get one soon!
B00355OW2O|5|This seal fit perfectly and water away from my engine air intake.  The quality is excellent and I would recommend this product.
B003U7ZY9M|1|My 1st negative review. They were ok initially. After a few washing and dry cycles, they became extremely linty. anything I wiped just smeared lint everywhere. Looking for a better option now.
B0087QDVYG|5|A very cool looking key chain.  Love it.
B0011YTZAU|5|Excellent price!!  Best we found anywhere else online!  And seems to work great too.  No problems at all :)
B006CSRH7I|5|Love this and fits 3rd row of my Durango perfect too help protect from dirt
B00OUSJK7C|5|Very good!!
B001GJ3FIS|3|Does not have much power or range on the &#34;JET&#34; setting.  Works OK, but there are better options available for the same price.
B004A2WXWW|4|GREAT LIGHT AND GREAT PRICE. EXACT FIT ALSO. BUT: I HAD TO RETURN THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE IT WAS BUSTED WHEN I RECEIVED IT. (THERE WAS HEAVY ITEMS IN THE SAME BOX IT WAS IN)
B00FRHOO9O|1|I bought two of these. Both were broken within 2 months. I will never buy this again.
B000765E1M|5|The bolt pattern fit perfectly on my 1996 Land Cruiser. I clamped it to my bumper and started with the front bolts for an easy install.    Note that the receiver is not flush or hidden under the bumper like you might expect. It stick's out roughly 5 inches beyond the bumper.    The product description says \\"A pin & clip is included with your hitch purchase.\\" This was not the case with mine.
B003RY53U8|4|I wish the lid would close, is all. I didn't realize it stayed open, so its not a very good travel mug. It keeps your liquid hot or cold for a long time. I actually brewed a cup of tea in here, forgot about it for two hours, came back and it was still piping hot!
B00XCOOYJO|5|Durable, accurate and easy to use.
B0002Z9KE0|3|I like having the step on the highest setting because I'm relatively short, but when you fold it up, it's awkward and won't fit in the bag.  Not that hard to switch from height to height, but I don't want to have to take it apart everytime I want to fold it up.  Otherwise, sturdy and works well on my Chevy Trailblazer.
B00AAOKOMK|5|I needed a spare key holder for my Mercedes-Benz C280. I'll tell others about this item from Amazon many car items.
B007AE0FE0|5|Worked great, looks awesome. easy install of just popping out the old and popping in the new one. even comes with bulbs, cant beat that price.
B007V2DX18|5|Excelente fit.... A pitty IT does not have the Porche Logo the heat shield for the older cayenne had
B002YC8C8E|4|This tensioner fit perfectly and does the job required of it. The bearing is made in China though and the protective washer for the bearing is very thin. I used the washer from the OEM tensioner in it's place though the thin washer likely would have worked just fine. All in all, worth the money and perfectly acceptable.  B
B007RHBASK|5|We have a classic car dealership [...] we always save paint for touch-up on every car we get so we go thru hundreds of bottles, this seller has by far the best price anywhere and a great product, Don't waste you time looking anywhere else, I will only by from these folks!!
B003M4OAY8|5|Good product at a good price.  What more can you ask for.  Delivered on time and the product was just what I expected for my late 90s Craftsman 42&#34; lawn tractor.  Been installed for a few months now and no issues
B004Z1LULS|5|Inexpensive and it cleans up the rear of the vehicle. Looks much better than the uncovered spare. Easy to install.
B00BPSUCPE|5|Used with Interdynamics (ACP-100 PRO) Professional charging kit to fill or top off 3 vehicles.
B004WMDVDU|5|I just purchased a used 05 Trailblazer and hadn't noticed there were no inserts until I went to use them. I was a bit worried from a couple other's reviews but they worked perfectly for me. They do seem a bit thin but they slid right in and stay in even when removing my beverage. I'm glad I bought them.
B005RR45ZM|4|Good Interior Light Kit. Makes My Car Look Good On Inside Especially At Car Meets. Overall Bright. Easy Installation. Good Product
B000C5FTKY|5|Perfect fit for my 1997 F150. Took 10 minutes to change and seems to be of good quality. Solved my sticking relay problems that caused my truck to continue the engagement of the starter after the key was turned off. Now I can put my hammer away that I used to hit the old one with when it struck and kept cranking.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Ordered this with the SHANREN  24&#34; 120W LED light bar. Everything fit great. The instructions were very simple and easy to follow. Took about 45 minutes for the complete installation. One of the easier wiring harness to install compared to others I have installed.
B004XACFK6|5|Nice light for the price.
B002MGUO7Y|5|It was exactly what I was looking for: sturdy, light weight and well constructed. I would recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a like product.
B007IVHFNY|4|This product worked good on my car so far
B001TZ4I76|4|Nice quality, but didnt work in my favor...not right size for the bench in my truck, but guess that is more my fault than the sellers. Worth the purchase if it was right size.
B00P3DF9AU|4|Great product.
B00B62QGG8|5|Awesome price saver. Great fit.
B00BJDM01O|5|I came by this cleaner by chance in a local store.  I fell in love with it.  Works better on cleaning automobile wheels than any other cleaner I've ever used.  Problem is I can no longer find it locally.  So glad I found it on Amazon.com
B00BTVTX1Q|5|Works perfectly on bmw 325i 2003
B000CMIV52|5|Easy to install, no need to take wheels off; no idea why a T coupling doesn't come with a kit but as an option as I don't see a point in having 2 valves and different pressure in each airbag.<br />Price was below anything I found online and in stores.
B0000AXRH5|5|This is a small funnel, It will work for just abought any task.Small and easy to store in a zip lock bag to keep it clean.
B0049MRJ9U|5|Arrived quickly and bolted right on, (only needed to remove rust from bolt holes.  It could be put on easily in 15 minutes if rusted holes would of been cleaned out first.
B000SBCHCA|5|product is excellent
B005Y0LU5K|5|The two plate frames I got were for my 2013 convertible.  The plates were just attached to the car and had no protection.  I got these because of the slim design to keep the DMV happy so nothing on the plate was obscured.  They really look very nice and the shine on the frame goes very nicely with the trim on the car.  My only disappointment was the covers for the bolts as they would not stay on.  Since the bolts themselves were sleek as well, it made no difference.  I hope to have these for the next 100,000 miles.
B007KNALPE|1|After 5 days. The halo ring leds stopped working. Have to replace the leds.
B000C11JLQ|5|Not much to day, but it worked to fix my mom's car.  I do find the design of this window lift to be a pretty poor concept, but I can't knock the product for that.  Hope I never have to buy (or replace) again, but if I do, I&#34;ll be ordering this.
B000BVRZ74|5|Works great, should be mandatory on all vehicles
B00JM0GAJE|5|Just like the original one.
B000BZGM1U|5|Used on my 2006 Pontiac Solstice.  Fit perfect and doesn't leak.<br /><br />You should also get the OTC Water Pump holder available here on Amazon for $30 less than at your local national change.<br /><br />Also will need the FelPro water pump gasket kit for O rings on the water pipe.
B00CMJC2H6|5|Had been without one for years because I thought it would be expensive. Works great.
B000NW8H3C|5|Original product and best price available
B003VBSUT8|5|My tail light (bulbs) kept blowing out every two weeks so my mechanic said I needed an entirely new tail light.  It was easy to install and it is working wonderfully.  Thanks!
B0030UXG76|5|Great quality,  was a bit tricky installing  it myself for the first time,  so I recruited help from someone that has done them before,  after everything was done great upgrade from the factory flares,  gives much more tire clearance
B004KDEWTS|3|The opening tool broke off within the first 10 minutes of using it. The screwdriver did its job. Obviously, this isn't a high quality tool set, but it is worth it for the price.
B001KSCTVE|5|I bought 5 of this item and the 4 that I am using now, work just fine. They came on time and as described. I was concerned about possible damage because 4 came in the same bebble envelope without any packing between them. They work fine so far.
B0068OCPKA|5|Installed on the 2013 Kawasaki 300.  It comes in my opinion a worthless first gear.  This sprocket did miracles and stretches out all the gears to a more even ride.  Don't have to switch out of first gear after 20 feet. Great for stop and go traffic. Definitely would recommend this item for this model bike.
B000C2W99G|4|Fit my 1995 Mitsubishi GST. Worked and fit great, good product. Had one fail on me after 100 miles leaking out of weep hole. Replaced by seller no problems since. Good Replacement product
B000IIBU9Y|5|This ball and mount are well made.  Welded joint was even and smooth.  Very good price point for product.  Product was as advertised.  Delivery was within indicated time frame.  Would buy again.    John
B000NOO798|1|This stuff does not work!!
B00E1SOLH0|5|Great product
B0048FVB6A|5|Excellent fit easy to install took quite a bit of time to receive it, I was updated that it was processing for shipment but took a long time to receive, would recommend
B001TI5IIQ|5|I bought this product to use on my 2001 VW Jetta.  First time in 10 years I've ever done any headlight restoration.  This product freakin' rocks!  My headlights were a thick, dingy yellow and now they look awesome!  They are not quite BRAND NEW headlights, but they are pretty darn close.  And for $9, it's so worth it!  FYI, the shop I've been going to for over a year was going to charge me $100.  Guaranteed my headlights wouldn't look much better than they do now.
B000UKKPAU|5|Great product and got a good deal on it from ridersneeds. I have already used it about 8-10 times and it works great. 5 out of 5. My only complaint is the gauge was not at zero when I received the item. (gauge was reading at 2PSI) This does not effect the performance of the item, works great!!!<br />Quick shipping too!
B00173U7D4|5|The smell is amazing -- sorts of vanilla undertones like a creamsicle. I use this for all odors and also just because I like the smell.
B00EOBAKRO|5|Was shipped on time and exactly what we expected.
B00BCRMBGQ|1|Quality its not good at all very disappointed
B000BYENT4|5|Excellent quality
B008J6TO6I|2|The hem on the whole too edge was sewn but not to the actual sun shield.
B006QL47WO|5|I got these lights a week ago. They look great. The only problem I had as that when molding the plastic where the bulb goes in, there was a small plastic imperfection that makes the bulb sit unevenly (only on 1 of 2 headlights). It was super easy to fix. Take your finger just bend it twice and its out. Basically where the plastic wield is (rim of light socket).  Thought it would be important because, if you don't see it and the bulb sits uneven it will burn the plastic rim (happened on OEM, partial reason for new headlight). These headlights are really easy to install. Remember the screw on side-panel. 10 min job. Make the car look much newer.
B000GZO6NG|5|Looks exactly like the stock floorboards and very easy to install.  No need to buy the official Harley part for this repair... save the money.
B005JUX1S4|4|Great pump and plenty of hardware to spare (depending on how it's connected)...directions could have  been better though
B00GSAUHB8|5|This is a great sun shade. Sadly it was too small to fit my 2012 Ford Fusion but it should fit my Kia fine. Great purchase.
B007TY7XV4|5|Why buy parts from the stealership, which are practically indistinguishable from the after-markets.  I also bought another door handle like this for a different door.  Both went in just fine.
B000IZ2X66|1|This will NOT fit '94 toyota pick-up. Both ends are 70mm the truck needs 70mm at throttle body and 60mm at intermediate duct.
B001QD27SI|5|item came on time. i been using it since I received it. item helps on long drives. product fits my car seat very well.
B003ZGD33C|5|The bracket was easy to install and looks great. Not having the fender makes the bike look much better. Would highly recommend if you don't want to bend your license plate.
B003LS1TU8|1|This is an amazingly poor quality product.  The fabric, the stitching, the appearance, all poor quality. I bought this cushion because it was the color I wanted.  However, the quality was so poor, I sent in back after opening.  Oh, the lumbar cushion...what a joke.
B002R04IEU|5|Worked great on my 1986 4x4 pickup.  No problems. Looks fine.
B00NB2X060|5|I've owned many portable compressors over the years, and I've borrowed many, and this kit is definitely the most complete for the money. The adapter to allow you to connect to the battery instead of a cigarette lighter was a great idea, and the die for re-cutting valve stem threads was brilliant.<br /><br />The compressor itself is the hardiest of the portable ones I've used and has both an air gauge and on/off switch. It's really loud and moves a lot, but no more than any other portable. It does the job well. The fact that it has a detachable compressor hose makes it worth the little more $ over other Wal-Mart cheapies alone.<br /><br />To top everything off, you'll get Kensun's amazing customer service to back the product, so you can't lose with this!
B00NLQTXK8|5|This is my first helmet I bought. My boyfriend and I ride often but I didn't have a helmet of my own so I had to borrow one of his every time and it is was an open face helmet and I hated it. I decided to go to a store that sold different helmets so I could see which ones I liked and this was my favorite. I got a size medium and the fit is perfect. It was a lot more expensive at the store so I thought I would look for it on here and I found it much cheaper. I would suggest going to a store to try the helmet on first to see what size will fit you best because by the sizing on here I should have got a small but when I tried on the small in the store it was too small and too tight. I absolutely love it. It cuts down on noise drastically making it very quiet and the venting system keeps you nice and cool despite the horribly humid weather we've had lately. Its a great buy, would definitely recommend!!
B000JIC1M8|5|Perfect fit and good construction for a light duty application. Well made and I would not hesitate to purchase another .
B003YO5X60|5|Very easy install and worked as advertised.
B007HRVQ8O|4|Shipped out quickly. I received with no damage and on time. Works great.
B00OZXP3BY|5|Look great, fit great and less expensive then aftermarket mats.
B004BRF6Q6|5|I purchased this to replace the left rear passenger window switch on my 2003 Chevy Malibu, which would lower the window but not raise it back up. Since the master control switch at the front driver side window was still opening and closing the rear passenger window, it seemed safe to assume that the problem was occurring at the rear passenger switch and not at the master switch. When I had a similar problem with the right rear passenger window switch I brought it to my mechanic and it cost me nearly $75 to replace. After watching my mechanic replace the first switch, I saw how easy it was so I decided to replace the second switch myself. Not surprisingly, I found the switch for sale on good old Amazon so I didn't even have to go to the Chevy dealership to purchase the part.<br /><br />When I purchased the switch it was being sold on Amazon by Switch Doctor, so I went to the Switch Doctor web site and viewed one of their video tutorials that demonstrate how to install a power window switch. Although the tutorials only show how to replace various master control window switches, the info was relevant to the much simpler rear passenger switch that I needed to install. With nothing more than a flat head screwdriver it took me about 5 minutes to replace the switch. The switch from Switch Doctor works great and it looks exactly like the OEM switch I removed. But the best part was the satisfaction of installing it myself and saving the extra $50 I would have paid my mechanic to do it.<br /><br />Please keep in mind that the only thing I received was the switch in a little brown box, there were no installation instructions. The assumption is that if you are buying the switch you know how to install it. I am a female physical therapist with absolutely no experience fixing cars, I'm a human body mechanic not an auto mechanic. Nevertheless, even though the switch didn't come with installation instructions, with the help of the video tutorials on the Switch Doctor web site, it was extremely easy to remove the old switch and install the new one.<br /><br />A special shout out to the good people at Switch Doctor for the great 5 minute video installation guides on their web site. I couldn't have done it without you!
B000GQ6LF6|1|Purchased this for a 2007 Saturn Vue, the manufacturer claims it bolts on without modification.  This is a lie. The center holes are about a 1/2 inch out of position and will require expanding the holes in order to get it to fit.  This is very disappointing to me.<br /><br />Also, Amazon's free super saver shipping is a joke. If you don't want to offer free shipping, don't.  But don't pull this passive aggressive \\"we'll ship it when we get around to it\\" garbage.  I had ordered multiple items from different sources.  The stuff that didn't come directly from amazon was shipped immediately, Amazon held theirs for a week before they shipped it. I was about to cancel the item and purchase from a local business when I got an email that it was being shipped. Very poor service in my book, I guess I'll have to take that in to account next time I want to buy something.  I used to enjoy buying things through Amazon.  I guess I will just source it locally and skip the Amazon BS.
B008GGII4K|2|Vtwin  3.3 gallon motorcycle tank had mounting tabs welded in crooked.
B007PP1P4I|5|Oh my gosh. These shades are perfect. They can be hung either way on a vehicle window. The only thing about them is that the plastic suction cups have to remain outside for a few days to air out otherwise they will stink up your vehicle. We are fixing to take a 10 hour trip and my folks who are 89 and 90 are delighted that they won't be sitting in the sun! I would highly recommend these shades.
B001LNRRM4|4|Great for the costs
B005KGIZIS|5|Our 9- yr. old grandchild is enjoying this very much, as it matches her current decorative mood.  A sturdy and attractive attachment to her backpack.
B000IZ5E1M|5|Fits and works just like the original one did. Genuine part, and no problems!
B00006364D|1|Not worth the money
B0022ZI0JY|5|It scraped those stupid dealer decals off my car in seconds flat. I had to use my hands and arms as levers to create the correct motion to scrape. It does what it's meant to do.
B00ASJTMZM|5|They got here fast ,looked very nice .worked well to hold my wheels on my car .I do recommend tighten with torque wrench not hands .
B004RSZOU2|5|Love this cover. It is exactly as advertised. Gets the job done for me. Fits perfectly on my 2001 Tacoma Crew Cab
B000HZFDOQ|4|The chains worked extremely well the few times that I used it heading to South Lake Tahoe during the '09 season. Provided a great amount of traction under heavy snow. However, one of the chains broke off (must have just been a defective link). I sent it back 2 months ago for a replacement and a brand new one was shipped last week with no problems. Easy to put on and take off. SZ127 was a perfect fit for a 195/60R15 2004 Honda Civic. Would have received five stars but had to ship this back at my cost!
B002BELP3Y|5|Saves a huge amount of time and hassle when drying your car.  Seems durable.  I am not sure how the silicone will hold up in a hot car for years, but I hope it will be OK.  Good price.
B000K0045G|5|Bought my 06 Impala used. Blown speakers were just one more item that I had to replace due to previous owner's harsh treatment. Price was much better than if picked from a local GM Dealer. Installation was simple.
B000CANYOM|5|Excellent item, extremely sturdy and well made. The chair rack was easily attached to existing RV ladder.  I am using the ladder to carry bicycles which weigh about 50 lbs.
B000N3W8J0|5|Really good quality, it is a very solid piece of plastic and it really keeps the dirt on the botton of the bucket, make sure you have a large bucked first like a painters bucket otherwise it will not fit
B007PPG0Q6|5|I've gotten two ballasts & two 3000k bulbs from this seller so far. The ballasts seem to be made well and so far work just fine. I was an idiot and thought that two ballasts were sold for the price of $12.00, but that obviously wasn't the case. So when my ONE ballast came in the mail I immediately ordered another one and paid the $20.00 for the guaranteed next day delivery. Well, I didn't get it until three days later. This wasn't the sellers fault, but I did e-mail Amazon and they damn near emailed me back immediately apologizing and said I would be reimbursed the $20.00 for shipping. Which was awesome! One of the 3000k bulbs I ordered would not fire up all the way, it would just flicker on then off. I had a proper relay for my setup and everything was connected properly, just a faulty bulb, so I emailed the seller and they apologized and said they would send me a new one. I think I got the package only two days later and they sent TWO new bulbs! Just plain great customer service.
B000CMDCKQ|5|Lost the caps the first week but overall great product. Does what it's suppose to do
B00MTZFYMI|4|Great, sturdy tire pressure gauge. Should last a lifetime.
B00UW1T31Y|5|Awesome!!
B00OQ1F7PM|5|works great.you must follow the hookup procedure as follows.connect the charger to the battery first and then plug the ac power cord to the wall outlet. if you plug in the ac power cord first and then make the battery connections,the yellow light will come on breifly and swicth to the green light and the battery will not charge.the instructions are not clear about this procedure.
B00FQKKNOW|5|Fits like a glove in my 2014 Toyota Tundra<br />Great product<br />Installed in 5 min<br />Combo set up is easy too
B0043063JU|4|for the price.....color is right on, just like the picture on amazon.  i had a very good experience with rv marine.  they were very helpful.
B009UZ1TE2|5|I use this spray to remove bugs off my front bumber. It's the best and easiest product I've ever used!
B008EQATGC|5|just what I asked for
B0009IBJE4|5|Great charger so far. works great, charges fast.Case is plastic and not real heavy duty but then you are not suposed to beat the H out of a battery chrger
B003ZVSEVI|1|quarter panels looked terrible I had to send them back not good customer service either.
B000779T3U|5|This is a great Cargo carrier.  It is lightweight enough to move from the back of RV to pickup.  I really like the way it folds up when empty.  I would not be worried about loading it to the recommended maximum at all.
B004V9I9W2|2|I have been using these towels for some time now and can now offer a fair review. These are over priced towels. These towels leave more lint than a bath towel.
B0050SFZBG|5|Worked great
B00P2VWCQ2|1|Didn't work
B000FW2MC2|5|Great for my office at work. changing review Old review: Whoops.  Was looking at cup-holder adapters, and saw this.  But it's not an adapter, it's an accompanier.  It will accompany your coffee all the way to the passenger seat and then onto the floor.
B003AYUB84|5|I love this wallet! I use it daily! Good seller :D
B000765MHI|4|This fan is very efficient and powerful, but makes a loud sound like a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner. I am a trucker so the sound doesn't bother me, but my friends hate it.     This fan is very popular with truck drivers who need to defrost their windshield in super icy conditions (turn heater on full blast, blow heat from dash/upper vents all over windshield, roll windows to regulate)    This fan has probably saved my life a couple times in Colorado for that, when the wipers ice up, you are screwed! Sometimes its so cold window wash doesn't help So this worked!     The pros:   works very efficiently, has dial to turn down the noise at lower speeds    The cons: Motor is cheap, may require removing and lubricating motor over lifetime of product,   NOISE  vibration  plastic mounting attachment breaks eventually before the fan gives out. (I make my own bracket then)  Keep kids fingers out of there, it will break them.     If you have no car AC, this will help you out for $20.
B000FK9N4E|1|This item is pretty cheap. I have seen much better versions of these. I wouldn't recommend buying this one. There are plenty of others available at local stores
B008CFCMS8|5|Part looked really good and installed really easy.  I would recommend buying from them. They respond really quick to emails if you have any questions.
B0018QMJ68|5|My son really uses this tray for food, games, garbage, just like that pic. I'm really happy with it. Got some for my friends...
B00546C8UA|5|fit the toyota as original equipment.always best to go with the manufacturer rather than aftermarket with some items.this is one,since the price at amazon was alot cheaper than through the dealer.
B0016H0O6G|1|Broke after a week! Spend more and get better lights.
B007JSGR9Y|4|Does it's job at a good price
B001EP2922|4|took some effort to install just because the bolts was hard to screw in.  I used some liquid wrench to loosen up some rust.  The company was quick to respond great customer service. It's a year old has some rust but its great I can rent a trailer.
B000F285EG|5|I have my Hi-Lift mounted to my 4x4, this is well worth the price to hold the handle in place so it is not dropping down and causing damage.  Very happy with it and would recommend this to anyone that mounts their Hi-Lift to a vehicle.
B0018N6NUO|5|I am giving this purchase 5 stars.  Delivery was excellent and fast.  Floor mats were exactly what I ordered.
B0024GLY4O|5|I bought this ancient style hydrometer because I prefer old fashioned accuracy.<br />The new fangled plastic types seem more likely to have bubbles stubbornly<br />adhere to the indicator and cause inaccurate readings. (annoying)<br />Of course, a glass hydrometer is far more fragile than the plastic sort,<br />but the glass does not discolor when testing hazardous radioactive waste.
B000H6P55W|5|We went on a road trip from Texas to Florida, we had extreme sunshine, wind and rain on the way. Our luggage stayed dry and in place.  My husband secured it and he had no problems with it at all.  At first the straps were flabbing in the wind and banging against the car. So we just fastened them so nothing would hang lose and there was absolutely no noise anymore. We couldn't even tell there was anything up there. We double checked every other stop and nothing came lose at all.  I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to everyone!
B003YJ47JO|3|I can't feel the difference, probably my injectors were clean so i didn't need this.<br /><br />Easy to use and i still have some carburetor cleaner left, witch is always great.<br /><br />I applied this on a E30.
B008CE0CS6|5|Great mount. Quality product made with heavy duty steel. A++
B004BTEJT4|5|I have been detailing cars for a long time and this is the best dry wash chemical I have found.  Does not scratch the cars surface even when really dirty, one bottle last approximately 5 cars... And I use it on my BMW 750Li which is a rather larger car.  Leaves a great shine.... No reason to wet wash cars any longer...
B00HVO0LVG|5|Awesome
B009FIBZZW|1|Didn't fit at all.
B002PQU5IY|5|I purchased this product in January 2011.  It was a great price for a pair of headlights.  The housing is made of some type of plastic.  I only needed the driver's side headlight, but it was cheaper to buy both headlights than go to the dealer and purchase one headlight.  The headlight functioned well until someone hit my car head on and totaled my car in March 2015.  I was pleased with my purchase.
B0030DCS54|5|Super fast shippiong item works great!  Exactly what I expected
B003YI421I|5|Bought it because I had a polymer gun frame that needed to be fixed. Give it a 5  works really good for it bonded strong.
B000C5E4T6|4|chev 350 , perfect fit
B0000AY9HO|3|A good idea very poorly executed in all aspects.  The round shank lends itself to putting all the twisting stress on the pin holding the ball on.  Lets face it with a 10,000 pound rating on the 2 5/16, a lot of tongue weight makes a lot of twisting on the ball.  I don't load them with grease as they get switched out and would make a mess in my truck and hands.  The shank is soft stainless and the twisting egged the hole a bit.  The displaced metal made the other balls impossible to get on and off so I had to grind down the bulges on the shank.  The nut is of a different grade of steel and has rusted fast on the shank and I cannot get it to loosen or tighten so it spins a bit now.  The plastic case you can get for them is lame.  The lid will not stay on.  I have seen the ones with the hex shank but they dropped the ball on the metal and do not offer stainless, a deal breaker for me. It could just be done so much better and it has been poor for years and years.
B000NVW1LM|5|97 ranger manual tranny leaking rear seal.  I used two bottles(just to be sure) and leak is gone.
B007557GH8|5|Nobody has a glassjaw sticker on their car... I have always love this band these past 13 years so I had to represent!<br /><br />Quality of the sticker is great and it stays clean.
B0081T3PP4|5|Cold as ever. easy to use!
B007XAJV64|5|Nothing clears smoke and cooking smells like Ozium !!
B0040JYPFS|1|These after market lights triggered the check engine light on my Tacoma. I can't use them.
B003OB0PTS|3|Purchased for my 02' WRX. I've had one particular OEM hose fail twice and decided to buy silicone hoses and improve the appearance under the hood as well. Unfortunately, the one hose I needed to replace doesn't match up. It's an 'S' shaped hose from the filler tank to the turbo cooler (I think) but the kit hose for this has a twist on the axis and is too short. Look's like others may have had the same issue in previous reviews. Hoses do look nice but they really don't stand out amongst all the other OEM hoses and tubes in the bay.
B000EDOSN8|5|I am so happy I bought these. I once forgot to close my vents before I bought this product and my insides got wet. Every since then I bought two of these to go over both vents. It is also cool looking and very functional.
B002P8H5EO|5|Part fit perfect. Works great. Cheaper than my local parts stores.
B00B2PKYU8|5|Quality durable product.
B0055FE1VO|5|This is a gift idea for my best friend who just got her first new car!  I think she will love it
B00029WYDU|5|this is probably the cheapest you can get it. works as advertised, i use it to clean my filters. ill buy more in the future.
B000KYV79E|5|Works as it should
B0016J7QKG|5|There are essentially two companies that make these custom fit sunshades. Heatshield is one of them. I live in Arizona, and I drive a black car..so this is a necessity in the summer! Fits perfectly with little if any gaps and definitely blocks out most of the sunlight.<br />It rolls and unrolls. This takes a bit longer to do than the fold up kind, but again, still worth it. When you roll it up it has a velcro assisted strap for keeping it as compact as it gets. This is where the one weak point is. The Heatshield company glues on their strap. In Arizona ...in the windshield, glue does not work. When it gets above 110 the glue starts melting and eventually the strap comes off. I solved this problem with a few well placed stiches from the sewing needle. Overall the best sunshade on the market.(I work in the automotive field) Custom fit to your vehicle.
B000FGIBYQ|3|ok
B0091RCISA|2|Found impossible to install as the chains recommended on their web site do not begin to fit. Further, the tag included or attached to the package of the chains has a list of the tire sizes the chains are intended for and that list does not include my size.
B001C6Q34S|1|I did a part check when I placed the order on Amazon. It said this filter fits my 2010 Outback. After about 40 mins of frustration of installing this filter, I gave up and went to my local Auto Parts and bought a K&N Filter 33-2304, which took me 30 seconds to install. It's not even worth the hassle of returning this filter to Amazon.
B00BF0IGIM|5|Amazing..........love this on my car, so easy to fix it.
B00BF3QTCY|5|Excellent.
B001BB4LBG|5|Looks good.  Will be using on spare tire for a trailer.  I think it would do fine.  Hope it will provide some protection from the sun.
B003V5L0FK|4|Fit my zzr 600
B008SEBQ2G|3|Future customer please note that this thing did not come with a screw to take the place of your current antenna. Also the screw that you'll need has to be European thread. Not standard American. The picture has a screw but it comes without it.
