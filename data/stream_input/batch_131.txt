B000FQ1SAU|5|Perfect fit for my Jeep Wrangler which was lifted 2 1/2 inches.
B000N9HZR4|1|Pump failed after two weeks. Poor quality.
B00S209B2I|5|very cute. My husband loved it and the kids did too
B00JVHLS3G|5|Fits perfect, looks good and showed up on time
B0007VANJK|5|Good quality hitch that fits my 05 Tacoma.
B00D3298A0|4|This full set heavy duty-Rubber is very heavy and also the downside is that the rubber has a strong odor that is not appealing to the noise, I would recommend washing it before putting it in your car.
B00HRRQ10W|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B007RYOPNK|5|Good sunshield.  Keeps the car cooler and fits my 2013 3-series perfectly.
B0022ZI0JY|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00T2GT9L4|4|I have not been able to try the charger successfully, and although I was thinking of returning it, the Anker customer service crew has been very attentive and helpful with trying to make things right.  I will update my review when I feel that I have used the charger successfully and have come to the conclusion that my car's battery certain is the problem.
B00GJKXW8M|5|Bright and white . Sometimes it has that hint of blue but it's just the angle .
B004BE60ZU|5|worked well
B00GN7YCJE|2|It is easy to purchase lights based on led count thinking more = better. I purchased 36mm festoon bulbs by cutequeen 6 led same size a year ago for a different car, and didn't realize I had only used 4 of the 10. So I put this one in and it seems dim. As in less bright than the stock halogen dim. I pulled out the old bulbs and they are MUCH brighter with 6 led vs 8 awful led. They also fit better (not feeling like I was jamming it in there too hard). So I would suggest you look those up for a brighter, better fitting bulb.
B000Z0HVHA|1|I had it in time for a road trip to Florida and back.  As other reviewers have stated, the male end is now so loose it has to be wiggled in order to get a connection.  I was going to return it but got it too far in advance of the trip to do that. I thought a piece was missing at either end. No. Just a product cheaply made.  Too bad.
B001NYQRUY|5|ok
B006RQ44O4|1|As is it is overpriced for what it does, now wish I had gone with another brand...flashpaq I think, this one only changes my tire size not the expected tire pressure.  I was hoping it was updatable but they aren't sure if/when it will ever include more for 2015 JKs
B000H0P9NQ|4|Impossible to get our camper up our rounded curb because the pavement is very high (old street, paved over numerous times) and our gutter is very low.  These made it possible to get the camper over curb but needed to attach to 2x4s then use other 2x4s for the &#34;front&#34; and &#34;back&#34; of the ramps.  Expensive but very durable and strong, can handle our 2,000+ lb. camper and full size Dodge Ram Charger no problem.  If you have a curb to get over these are the key!  See other reviewers photos for the 2x4 trick, modify to your needs.
B003VAUFKG|5|Works exactly as described.  Added the length I needed to accommodate a hitch extension.
B00DZUCPXW|5|Great fit fast shipping.
B00NQL0WWG|5|Super casque,merci chalereusement.
B00BN453DG|5|Great product.  Fast delivery!  Very happy
B00Y7BLATI|5|This sticker is amazing. I bought it for my husband truck and he's very pleased. It's easy to put on without a lot of effort. It has very nice coloring which has not faded thus far. It has survived the elements of being on a back windsheild.
B00KWFZBKM|1|Do not buy. Listed incorrectly, these are bolt spindles NOT spring bolts. These do not have springs, and they are not what is listed in the title. I am very disappointed
B008S9QUGI|5|Very easy to install and looks just like the original
B000C5SG54|5|Original equipment for my 2000 tundra limited.  Check engine code self cleared after install so I guess that's all one could hope for.
B00RNNNC20|5|Everything I expected.
B00ECKI4WA|4|Excellent product. Leaves my hands cleaner than other goop & without that residue some leave behind. This rinses off & lathers with water so if you need a waterless cleaner this isn't for you. Company is a little over solicitous for feedback but better they care than not at all. I'll be buying more in the future.
B000BYELQY|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B006FUT09G|1|Windex is better
B00NLP7270|5|fits is good, easy to install and looks great.
B000CIUBGS|5|Met my expectations exactly
B000BZI5II|5|Best blades ever!!! These blades really keep the windshield clean, even after a LOT of use.
B0024NSGYS|5|Well pleased.
B003EOZLEO|5|Perfect for 2012 JK.  Installed in about 20 minutes and give the Jeep a great look and protection.
B004GFTC0E|5|I will go ahead and start off this review by saying that it really works. After wasting my money on similar products, I have found something that does what it says it will do. First of all, foggy worn out headlights can really make your car look bad. With a little bit of time and patience, you can make your vehicle look good again. Follow the instructions and have a dependable drill is all you need. Simple. I've tried those other brands with little or no result at all. Highly recommended and will use product again in the future.
B0091OG8XE|5|Came quickly in protective packaging. Would have preferred smaller quantity options, but a more solid choice than the Hy-Ko, which arrive twisted and is more difficult to install.
B0042CIRH0|3|Flange is ok but inexplicably the washers provided are way too big for the bolts. The head of the bolt can almost pass through the washers WTH!!!<br />The holes in the flange are also oversized for the bolts which are in fact the correct size for this turbo (Garrett t3)
B000ET8D0G|5|I love it.
B00E0FRVUI|4|Good budget motorcycle jacket. Feels and looks good. Get a size that fits, otherwise paddings slide.
B005N6XUIU|5|Fits a little tighter than I wanted but I love the shirt!
B005G3XFW6|5|Get comments and compliments when people see this.
B00651C998|4|Works better than stock antenna, does not bend as bad a stock antenna when driving at interstate speeds.
B007EXP006|4|fits well
B000CCFJWK|5|Classic look,classic sound.
B00KTHXZLU|4|Cases fit well.  The panic button may fall off when opening it as it does not have the retaining clip that comes with the factory key fob and that may make it not water resistant as the original.  Will see if I can somehow pry the original clip off and use it with this replacement part.
B00AY2YN4I|5|Exactly what I ordered.  And then some, will definitely order again
B000VTQVQ2|5|A+ Old School style shifter handle/knob with every threaded bushing possible... Looks and feels good...
B0049EIREE|5|GOOD
B00HZSL9GE|5|The Gerbing products are top quality
B0091MACY2|1|Don't buy.very cheaply made and nobody gets back to you
B002RSIK4G|4|Love this stuff.  So much easier than roof goop or whatever.  I did find a similar product that was obviously a knockoff version at Lowes for about 1/2 the price.  They only sold silver (no white or black or double sided), but for 1/2 the price my RV roof can look a little funny.<br /><br />I did notice that when it gets really hot, the areas I've pulled it tight (like around a roof rack or ladder rack) the Eternabond starts pulling and melting off of it.
B00RW279W6|5|When I had a issue.. This co stepped up and made good!! Would do business again!! Thanks 👍👍
B00DSD56T6|5|as discribed
B003W0MR0G|5|I hope they never stop making these...in case mine gets too worn. I absolutely love it!
B0040MXQ1O|4|These things are the balls!
B003O70V0A|3|Looked to be a great product, got here the following day. Took the bulb out of package , checked it out and dropped damn thing! Tip broke! Buy cheaper bulb as I should've
B000B68BWC|5|As good as the factory handle assembly, the factory handles are no longer available from the dealer, so this did the job!
B001CA8PUO|5|Fits perfect on my 2010 Xterra Off Road.
B009E9K5QM|3|The range is pretty short.  I have to be standing right next to my car in order for it to work. But overall it does its job.
B000WNU0NM|4|Would have liked assorted sizes for the different pedals on my bike.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|great lights
B00LQHR9GE|1|I bought a Lightbar for my son and water got into the Lens and I was wondering if I could get my money back or get a new one very upset
B00KY0JMBO|5|Brand spanking new at half the cost of refurbished. Looked very much like any other brand of brand-new starter, sitting in its box, when it was delivered, and I installed it and the car started right up first time and continues to do so. The warranty is great too. No complaints from me about this product!
B011BKGIBW|1|It has different wiring than the original..and it doesn't have a reverse light in it.. Knock off
B002UC8TVS|5|arrived on time and was exactly what I needed.
B009I24MOG|5|This mat is exactly what I needed for my Hyundai Santa Fe.  While the color is a bit darker than my leather interior (I knew it would be), it still looks great.  The weight is perfect in that it's heavy enough to stay in place while loading luggage and stuff, yet flexible enough to easily roll up when I use the 3rd row seats.  Trimming was easy using a utility knife.  I couldn't ask for more.
B003C01FD6|5|A+
B00VNBEBCS|5|These bulbs come beautifully packaged with easy to follow instructions. I had no issues during installation as these simply replace your factory bulbs. The lighting, as advertised, is instant, and fans are a barely a whisper even with the hood open while the lights are on. The light matches my switchback leds perfectly, and I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a more sophisticated look on their vehicle.
B0126YHT06|4|This review is for the 4 pack. Bulbs have come a long way since the LEDs have become more main stream and more affordable.  These replacement bulbs so far seem to be nice quality, bright and since they are LED hopefully will last a long time.  There does not appear to be any warranty with this brand of bulbs though.  I will update my review if I have any longevity issues.<br /><br />4 stars<br /><br />I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest review.  I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.
B00O5BVMJI|3|I got stuck on a beach and tried to use this...no luck. I put in on correctly and it spun around a few times and didn't get me out. I have to give the benefit of the doubt to the product because the beach I was on was very wet sand and I was stuck deep. I'll still keep them in my toolbox to use again in case I get stuck, but not sure if I'll depend on them. Perhaps the product may work in loosely packed snow or very loose sand.
B001P29O5Y|5|This thing is heavy.  Solid.  Easy to install.  Not sure I'd trust the velcro straps on a long trip but for getting the kid's bikes to the park and back it works great.
B004LFABDQ|4|Exact replacement - worked on 2009 Heartland Razor Toy Hauler
B00DFPVN5S|5|nice stickers
B00GUF74HQ|5|It is a very helpful device. My husband has a very bad back and this makes the working the tailgate much easier for him.
B000COBXPA|4|Havent needed it yet but looks good
B007HG7WUQ|5|PERFECT.
B00WL11AMS|4|It works, but I'm sure like other small portable (affordable) inflaters, it's fairly slow.  Going from about 32psi to 40 psi took around 8 minutes.  I found when the car was actually running, the inflation seemed to go a tad faster.  I would have preferred the quick connection over the screw on, but otherwise this so far has been worth the low price.
B00EAE545S|1|Died after 3 months of use and it isn't eligible for return.
B000FPYCOK|4|They work ok but the they took a month or so for them to break in and slide without much effort.
B003EP52I8|5|Doesn't stick real good.  But good product
B00KXE3Q3Q|5|Very kool !!
B00FATT7UK|3|It's nice but it's not exactly round, more oval shaped.
B0043G8J4Q|5|Very good shipping, arrived as advertised
B0112XMM3Q|3|Not really the quality I expected .. Maybe it's just me.... I've orders stickers from other company's & thought they were made of mabey a better vinyl.. Again just mabey me.. Try for yourself n convince me otherwise
B00NOL6RSG|5|My EMT guy told me that the lights were great at a cheap price so I took his word and ordered 10 of them for our ambulances. And not a single one has broken down or anything. So I think it was an excellent deal and I would order more in the future.
B000ALJ4B0|5|Matches my vehicles color perfectly, what more can I ask for.
B005FKS6IS|5|Great product.
B000C5BVRO|5|was ok
B000C9IJDO|4|It's pretty good I haven't had a problem with my water pump.
B002JC7MFI|5|Perfect fit at a great price
B00KMYYQ5O|5|This stuff is really amazing.  Purchased to retreat my Sunbrella travel covers. I purchased a pump sprayer at the local hardware store to ensure good coverage. Highly recommended.
B000C33KLG|5|good
B008H08LQU|5|Bought two of these for my 2004 Honda Element.  What a difference!  Very bright.  Just wish the color wasn't so blue.  I would prefer more of a yellow color.
B0041TU56A|5|Did the trick!!
B00VFXD7SI|4|Wish they were higher quality but they look awesome! Because they are coming direct from the manufacturer you won't get them for several weeks so don't throw away your old ones until you get these.
B000EAIERW|3|Worked well for a couple years then they both broke. Straps are strong but handle part ripped at the end.
B001SPT804|4|Excellent quality, and it works just fine.<br />new plugs and plug wires, and ignition coil, and running smooth and strong.<br />also cleaned the mass air flow sensor.
B00O83FK32|5|Very easy install, less than 5 minutes per side. Excellent fitment.
B0013LGWXO|4|Good product.. installed and seems to adhere well.
B00ZS275QC|5|They look great and were easy to put on.  If you get the back seat cover there is a good video on Youtube to help flipping down the back of the rear seat.
B009LDQUE2|5|Fits well, looks good, worth the price.
B000RY1V5W|4|Worked as it should, one of the adjustment knobs was broken but it still got job done.
B004TRKBOK|5|got 5 for my family and 1 for me
B001TAJXXA|5|They look great but I had my mechanic put them in for me @ a cost of $85
B00KMD9Z3I|1|much too big for my car
B00IVP3MCO|5|Excellent fit and weight comfort plus
B00BITKPPW|4|Easy to install, it looks like a good quality though the lever might be slightly weaker than the factory handle. I can feel a little more flex in the handle before the tailgate releases. It would have been nice to drill my own hole for the camera since the aftermarket camera was much smaller than the hole so I had to fill it with resin and drill it out.
B000C2EEBW|5|LOVE THIS GASKET INSTALL WAS  EASY WITH PIN K1500 5.7 SUBURBAN NO LEAKS
B0000AY69V|4|Works very well absorbing the excess water after a wash
B00AZ4TYEE|5|Got this set for my birthday...bought it myself!  Then installed it myself after watching a you-tube video.  Would have messed it up but I saw the video first.  I love these.  Keeps the rain out of my car while allowing me to keep my window cracked even in torrential rain.
B00QB0HM90|5|Absolutely the best camera I've used, have 5 vehicles and this is clearest, sharpest picture in screen of them all. Hooking it up to the factory Uconnect system was a snap. I'm overly surprised on quality and ease of install. Thanks you Brandmotion!
B004I0I10Y|5|Fits great on Volvo S40 and installation was very easy, also came with light bulb in the assembly. The only problem was that the first one they sent me was defective, it did not supply power to the light bulb.
B00AKYOOYY|5|This is exactly the same anti-freeze coolant that your local Nissan dealership will stock and sale to you. This was purchased for a 2011 Nissan Rogue and delivered without any leaks from the container.
B0076DID6W|5|I got this for my grandma and she loves it.  Its so worth it!
B007KA7PP6|5|Exact fit, thanks a lot.
B00FMN7V0W|3|I spent almost 2 hours trying to install this and wondering why nothing lined up. I've installed about 5+ exhaust systems on different cars I've owned so i'm not new to installing these. I loosened everything, reconnected the pipes multiple times and tried twisting them. It seemed as if the exhaust system was too long. I ended up cutting an inch off of one of the pipes and it STILL didn't fit. After getting frustrated I decided to take it to a muffler shop. They ended up getting it aligned after cutting an additional inch and a half just to get it to line up with the hangers. My guess is that this one missed the QC department? I really want to give this 2 stars but this system does sound very good so I don't think that would be fair. I have a 2015 JKU. The instructions had no mention of cutting anything UNLESS it was a 2 door. So to anyone buying this you may need to make major modifications to make it fit.
B003KTW0DS|5|great quality wires
B00MW8G2IW|5|Good stuff, worked like a charm.
B00EPKNHFG|5|Shows the pride I have in my son! Almost wish I could paint it all over my car.. LOL
B000W0KTMW|2|Ahh yes. Installed on my R1 in the evening. Next morning spent 20 minutes jiggling the key and swearing.  sprayed silicone in which dripped on my brakes naturally and finally the lock popped open. So convenient I'll be using it as a paperweight from now on.
B00319WBVI|5|Excellent
B00VNQM9UE|1|theu suck not even bright my fog lights are brighter 😒
B004NSJW9U|5|Fog lighs work great use them all the time
B000BZJ6J0|5|as advertised & arrived on time.....
B007TYR0ZI|5|This set has been on the truck over a year. So far so good. No signs of  corrosion like the originals yet.
B005VTT376|2|Make sure the color that you're looking for is right .....
B00B91L23S|5|Easy to install, useful, reasonable price.
B0050Z9TAW|5|Very good product.
B004C4YRFO|1|Would not program. ToOK it to dealer, they stated not the right one.
B00E9W2PPS|5|Fit perfect and in great shape when arrive
B00RW856W0|5|Great cover.
B001KN8HO2|5|Works like a charm.  I even carried a full propane tank in it.
B0083G3AXC|5|Little cubbies for phones too small but handy table for book and a drink. If it were flat I would like it better.
B00E9P9A4O|5|Works perfect, my 3rd order, I have been giving them out as gifts
B005N6YESA|5|GRANDSON LOVED IT
B000E283S0|4|Works very well if you wrap it so it adheres to itself or if used on smooth clean surface. I needed to repair a rusty old Ford muffler, I cleaned it the best I could without investing to much time in it. The tape held up in some areas very well, in others it just pealed up and become stiff.
B00UFERZKO|5|good
B0007ZAJRM|1|It didn't solve my shudder problem in my 2004 Saturn Vue which was due to old/bad torque converter.  A transmission fluid flush helped a lot more.
B001ABMU7E|2|Have had others. No performance gain on this and whine sound is annoying.
B00BITRJ9M|4|just what I needed
B00DX8A0A6|5|Excellent value.
B0048J0400|5|Redesigned from the original type.  It now has pulleys on both ends of the track, and the harness lead off the motor is longer.  Went in easy, runs smooth.
B002ZBPXGS|4|great product but one of the bottles leaked in the packaging
B000FG4C6W|5|I use this in my hen house and it helps keep the flies away! AWESOME
B000M8NZ70|3|okay, about what I expected, but not as good as I hoped.
B000OCHBK6|5|worked great fast shipping
B004BIYYJU|5|Exactly what I wanted.
B001R8ZSRE|5|its great. I put it on the back of my white car... shows well !
B00E63TI32|5|Thought it would be to big bought it for the wife now I won't one.
B008YFTJTG|5|This product is what was expected I will recommend it
B002E3644W|5|Great price
B000PL0KA4|5|I saved money buying my new wiper blades through Amazon versus more prominent auto parts warehouses. Not only that, but instead of griping about having one wiper left in my size on the shelf (as seems to be my problem..) I am able to order both at the same time and have them in two days!<br /><br />The Bosch Excel is truly a fantastic wiper blade as it does its job - keeps water off my windshield! Would buy again!
B000JZD90Y|5|This product fit on my 1999 dodge dakota. Went on easy once everything was taken apart.
B004NBQ6AU|5|Couldn't ask for a better deal tank and pump all in one
B0000AY4MK|4|very nice
B00X01JH1O|5|Cover is  a little big but great quality.
B000C7TU1Q|1|spectra and amazon said that this was the correct radiator for my tacoma. looked like the correct one when it showed up. when i tried to install it in pickup it didn't fit and spectra and amazon would not return or exchange it
B00GSAUHB8|4|Works well.  A little hard to get the hang of how to refold it to get it back in its storage bag, but there's a Youtube video to show you how to do it, so it's not that big a deal.  I'm happy with it.
B0098WDL8E|5|True Red, delivered perfectly on time. Highly satisfied.
B0024E5P78|4|I bought 4 of these and all worked great except one had a short in it and stopped working.
B0097VIFB4|5|As expected.
B003JZW7QS|5|Exactly what you think it is, a high quality head gasket able to hold the boost.
B00D1CQVIY|4|Had to replace swith to fit my dash but it was other than that everything works perfectly
B00M0CQARS|5|Looks nice
B007TMYGZ2|5|Great product and fast shipping. Highly Recommend :)
B004GCW7W2|4|Fits what else can u say
B00Z5QQZXU|5|Shipped on time and in good packaging and all of them worked. I operate a travel travel Trailer on solar power only and these low power consumption lights will allow me to use more at a time and of longer duration not worrying about draining the batteries..
B006XIZ3AK|5|Delivered as promised
B0006O2PBW|5|Love this product!
B00DJE1OYU|5|They look awesome, they survived the 75th Sturgis rally and I got a lot of compliments.
B000S2UGWC|5|Rubber cover on original switch had rotted.  This replacement switch seemed to be a direct replacement.  Install was easy and could be done without removing any interior panels.  There are several tutorials online for replacing this switch from the outside.  This replacement works great and fits just like the original.
B000FCR46G|5|Great
B0016IAIK2|5|Only challenge was expanding the two holes in the rear frame of the vehicle to 1/2&#34; diameter.  Having cleared that hurdle though, the hitch bolted right up (using a pretty ingenious tool that Draw-Tite included with the hitch), and has been working like a charm.
B004RCX770|5|It is extra, did not realize the tote came with bracket, so have extra
B00681BDXI|5|I am very happy with my keyless remote for my 2008 Ford Focus.  It was quick and easy programming instructions. Would buy again cause they are very reliable.
B00UW0HFXS|5|I actually ended up purchasing the smaller SL-1 size instead of this size, but other than size, they are both identical.  I found it to be a very secure way of keeping my trailer locked.  Rugged, welded, steel construction and easy to use.  I have a UFP A-60 trailer coupler and it fit nicely over the 3&#34; square coupler.
B004ME11FS|5|It worked just as expected.
B00BH1990I|5|Looks great I love them.
B00265FXTA|5|Originally these are OSRAM lamps (which most manufacturers recommend) just under the brand of sylvania for some reason. Running almost for a month, had absolutely no problems. Beam is bright, color is very white (it wasn't yellow from the start)visibility became much better after replacement. Hope they are going to last long!
B004YESNX4|5|this was a perfect fit for my 00 Toyota Sienna. Installation took about an hour.
B000E2CO9Y|5|Fit my Outback Subaru perfectly.  Lost the original in the car wash so I'm glad this is an easy (and not too costly) replacement.
B004XWFDJO|1|did not fit, too small of a radius to clear the oil pan. MaganFlow tech line was of no help.
B000B6AF80|5|I bought this particular kit on a recommendation from others and I am glad I did.  I read several other reviews saying the brush is poor quality and while it isn't professional quality by any means it more than enough did what it was intended to do.  I just made sure before I painted to run the bristles over my hand thus knocking out any loose bristles.  The paint has held up very well and I am pleased with the color. I got the cherry red and it is indeed very bright of a color! Overall would recommend to others!
B00N2M0GXY|2|Two months after using the plastic emblem falls off the bolts.
B00DQJB948|5|Reception was equal to if not better than the long original antenna. Looks good also.
B00RM327NG|5|ok
B000JWM9EE|5|Just what I was looking for at a good price ..
B0012TREK2|5|Works well!  Easy to work with.
B008ZE8VRC|5|2015 Toyota Tundra:<br />1 - Installation: Not too bad. Make sure you orient the &#34;L&#34; brackets correctly. One attachment point on the backside of the heatshield fought me a little.<br />2 - Increase in horsepower: I'll have to take everyone's word for it but I'm sure there is some.<br />3 - Throttle response: Definately improved!!<br />4 - Sound: It growls when you step on it. Sounds great with my Borla Exhaust.<br />5 - Increase in gas mileage: Nope (see #3 & #4)<br />6 - Worth it: Definately!!<br /><br />Note: Make sure you re-torque all the band clamps periodically.
B008Q5ULKU|5|Love it
B00U8695HK|1|doesnt do anything. All the 5-star reviews seem to be fake.
B00AWN2BHU|4|Was a gift for my daughters 16th Birthday. She was so surprised. Only place I could find sharks on seat cover. Material itchy though if wearing shorts or swim suites.
B004VO952A|5|Loved it
B0009IQXCC|5|The product is great..... I recomended
B00L8SWJCA|5|Very comfortable
B00W9EBF0Y|1|I think the heat in the garage ruined it. Had it less than a month and only works sometimes. Therefore, not too trustworthy. So still rely on the tape on the wall to make sure we don't crash into the wall.  Was hopeful and thought it was a great idea but, not Texas tough!
B00PRJI9O8|4|Haven't had to use the sealer yet but the compressor works fine and the gauge seems to be accurate.  I like having this as my first option to fix a flat, rather than crawling on the ground to lower the spare.
B009F5A4JS|4|Heavy duty. A real pain to install by yourself. Only negative was the support bracket on the left side sits tightly against the rear bumper of my 2014 E350.
B000JFJLP6|5|Great portable charger
B0002SQUHW|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B009BEGV6S|5|Works great. Easy to install.
B001BDSRM8|5|Definitely a better product than the K&N Cold Air Intake that I had on my truck that threw mass air flow sensor codes. Gained maybe 1.0 or 1.5 mpg's with this product. Would recommend to any Tundra owner
B00VOUVT5A|5|Exactly as advertised, great seller and Product
B00VMMMSMI|5|so pleased with this item, I am excited about giving it to my son
B00S9OM09I|3|It's a nice frame don't get me wrong but the quality is not the best. I was ok with the look cause at the end of the day it's just a license plate cover. But after my mom using it for 2 days the glue that was used for holding the bow in place stopped working and the bow fell off. We think it's due to the heat cause it was such a hot day. Not sure though. It luckily fell while it was parked so I just threw on some crazy glue and it looks nice again. Also the height of the bow didn't let me fit it on the back of my moms 2012 Camry. So she put it on the front and I got her the other plate by the same company with the bow that's in the middle bottom. Just something to think about before buying.
B00065ZIJ2|5|Good product
B003SOG1CG|5|Great fit and works well.
B00POG32PK|5|This company communicates well if there's an issue and I love that. This really sets off the bling on my tires. Cute. Love it!
B00VX2NOK2|5|Excelente
B00KPWBBLA|5|We own a 2015 jeep wrangler sport unlimited... according to amazon these were not made to fit our jeep, however I read several reviews from people with the same year saying that they will fit so I took the chance and so HAPPY we did. They will fit but you have to love them and wiggle them into place, but it's possible.... they are very well made, heavy,  and durable..... yes the box will arrive damaged (the rails are heavy) but we had zero problem with the box being so bad our suffering was falling out.... all of the bolts were included and nothing was missing. Very pleased with purchase!
B00J59ZWGO|5|It's what expected.
B00G8EQ5GU|4|Nice key for the price.
B00D9DTWQ8|5|It looks so cute on my Ford Focus. I've had it on for a few months now and it hasn't faded at all or fallen off.
B00E9FSMFW|4|Did the job...
B0022XDK1O|4|I like 'em.
B002EOAM80|1|2015 Kia Forte 5. Don't fixed
B00120FDJU|4|Great....had to remove tire to put on
B001BFO7DO|5|Great fit and works well.
B000CCM3JC|2|This did not hold up to the vibrations of my lawn mower.  It failed in the first half hour of use.
B00NM3MOLU|5|Easy to put on really cute
B002OW5J44|5|Great service and price worked great.
B00U7OS1J6|5|I like the magnet image very much. I put it on my car and unfortunately it's already started to fade and it is peeling a little bit. It's difficult to find an auto magnet with an image of Our Lady, so I'm glad it was offered through the vendor.
B002SSGANI|5|Perfect fit. Fast delivery
B00TY78AAM|4|really enjoyed these! fit my 2000 toyota solara pretty well. keep in mind they aren't custom made so don't expect them to fit perfectly! i love them they are super boho-ish. my back seat covers came with a slight tear but amazon helped me resolve that. I'm really glad i made this purchase! all i need is car mats now :)
B0073XT3IC|5|Got it for the wife's car. She likes it. No longer looks like an RC car with that obnoxious O.E. 3 foot long one.
B008B08P12|5|Perfect fit..they look sexy, i promise lol
B00HQZ92UQ|5|fast shipping and they work great
B0024E6V30|5|Always has been a good product. We live in CA and this is our third year of drought. The water supply for our very large city area has been using the dregs leaving an egg smell and/or taste in the tap water. We have not had that problem because we use these filters inside and outside.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Love this sun protector!  Works great & received it quickly!
B007XYG0XM|4|Awesome quality, beautiful leather.
B004K3NW4E|1|Product has broken for me twice. Good customer service but don't want to have to keep sending unit back for leaking and breaking.
B000C57L6Y|5|Just installed these on my 01 Chevy S10 Xtreme, one of the best purchase's I've made so far. Comes with all the hardware, bushings, washers, etc. My truck drives nice and smooth now, didn't realize how bad it actually was until I swapped out my old dead ones for these. Shipping was fast, and install was easy, I suggest watching a YouTube video if your new to this and are doing the work yourself. Might I add these are listed on Monores website as premium grade shocks and I only paid half the price on amazon vs going to a parts store or any other website! I suggest greasing your zerk fittings on your front end while replacing the shocks since your under your vehicle anyways. Very happy with this purchase!
B000EQ9ZVK|5|Part was exactly what I needed. It was a quality product, and I received it very quickly. I now have blinkers that work on my car. A big thumbs up!
B008MBMP4S|5|Much less expensive than dealer's product and easy to install.
B000CO7DIQ|5|did the job!
B00D9C2CDO|5|I finally get to review this!  I purchased it around Christmas and finally got to use it for a trip to California this summer.<br />I used it with my 2013 Subaru Impreza with two roof rails, but no cross rails.  We loaded it with two very large suitcases and one small case and had lots of room left over.  This extra room was not a problem though.  It just cinched down more in the empty spots (the back) and didn't budge.<br />I used it with a special no-slip mat between it and my roof.  This, along with the each of the four straps going either left or right, kept it very snug.  Enough that I could hit 90MPH without movement.  The gas mileage suffered greatly, but that was the worst of it.  We even went through a few heavy downpours without any water seeping in.<br />At the end of each day, when we went to a hotel, as I took out the luggage, the dead bugs that were plastered to the front just fell right off.  Then I simply stored it in the car overnight.
B00HEFDBOG|5|Saved over 500.00 in repair part under 70.00 this you
B000CMHHR0|5|Great fit would recommend to any rider out there love it
B000CPA5WQ|5|First great on my 00 civic, straight bolt on , sounds good, better than my rusty old one.Also bought pacesetter full exhaust no mods straight bolt.I luv it.
B0080E6BHO|5|Perfect fit, the sponge filter (for large items) is part of this filter!
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|great products
B001DRHMMS|5|Was able to replace myself
B0002SRCMO|5|Does its job. Wish it was cheaper though. Great quality.
B005DX6BKW|5|Pretty easy install for me and they are working well so far. I would recommend them if you are thinking about buying them.
B00ZEJGDT4|3|Works okay.  I wish it went into the neck a little more.  If it did it could have a two oring seal.
B00C1YI2XA|5|Great  light will  buy more
B00M7EDU3Q|4|I'll be updating this review as I get more time with the B18C1 engine I've just rebuilt. For now, it looks like these valves are doing their job adequately well.<br /><br />There's an important point to make though -- what's pictured for this item is a set of valves with concave faces, similar to stock. What I received instead are flat-faced valves, and likely as a result of this I'm measuring a bit higher than stock compression. As it happens I'm not upset about this at all, but it might be meaningful to others.
B00H8M12SW|1|This item don't recommend let than a year is broken even I take to a professional to install it
B00L1KHWMM|4|Overall its was good the replacement got to me on time. The only bad thing was that the rubber part that fits over didnt quite fit so I had to use my old remote part.
B002L7C3IC|5|Makes the truck look really good!! Better quality than the factory emblem!! Will use this seller again in the future!! Thanks td
B00AQBIICK|1|Didn't even get one day use out of it before the wire melted and destroyed itself.
B001JT7DD8|5|Works and looks good
B00L4V9ECY|5|It does exactly what it's supposed to do.
B00FE0WJBY|5|Works like a charm
B00480GYSA|5|awesome bulbs, at 4300K these produce more visible light than the higher temp bulbs.
B000B8N3MS|5|Great replacement
B00BLX1L4O|3|Looks good but did not stick well.
B003N9MQCK|5|I love these two mugs and price was great.  I use both of them daily.  Did not like the long wait for delivery but whatever.  Couldn't find them in any store nearby so amazon.com came through again.  These mugs hold about 32 oz each and the insulation really works great.  I highly recommend them.  I had one that lasted me over 20 years before I got these so have had lots of experience with them.
B000EDSSMA|2|This did not work good for me. It did not tell you you needed so much space behind it in order to race it up out of the way. I have to take it off the stove when I use the stove.
B00MJ41A6S|5|11 chevy cruze for good and looks good
B00F5WBUNY|1|It stopped working within 2 months after purchase.  To clarify, the unit would shut down after being on for a few minutes.  It's made of a lightweight thin plastic and it doesn't feel substantial or well built.  I went ahead and bought a Garmin and haven't looked back.  Stay away from this cheaply made POS.
B00B4CTKA4|5|A friend fixed my car...this was so much easier and cheaper than a dealer!
B000BQSIWK|5|Love it. Works great.
B001UMZ07A|3|Takes a long time to do all the steps and A LOT of elbow grease. Took me nearly 3 hours to get through all the steps. Looks nice when it's done but takes entirely too long
B0044AZ4BC|5|Product was just fine and fit perfectly
B007V2DBG0|5|excellent
B000CPI5Z0|5|This has been one of the best investments I've made for how my car runs, in performance, cleanliness, and economy. MUCH  smoother idle and feel when running at freeway speeds. I've got a 1997 Ford Probe GT pushing 225,000 miles, and this stuff makes my car feel young again. Much better throttle response, and feels like it's got more get-up-and-go than it had before. I've always run high-quality fuel with cleaner additives (Chevron w/ Techron, Shell, etc.) but nothing made the difference this stuff did. Took 2 treatments to really see/feel the results. 1 to break up all the sh*t clogging my fuel system, the second to flush it all out, and wow. Went from roughly 19-20 mpg combined city/highway to 22-25, depending how I drive. True test will be my next smog. Probes typically runs dirty, and Fresno, CA has some strict guidelines, but with the new cat I put on last time (to pass by the skin of my teeth) and running this through with every oil change, I'm feeling confident. It's $10-15 you won't regret.
B008BYQBVY|5|AAA+++
B0031BUBDG|5|luv it.a must
B00BRYF706|5|WORKS ON TAO TAO 49CC SCOOTER!
B00HJEGQQ2|5|These are nice and bright.  Much brighter than the cheaper LEDs.  These worked great in my vintage motorcycle tail light.  I wanted to take some amp draw off of the 40 year old charging system by installing LEDs, and these worked great.
B0055F50UU|2|They were shipped fast & that is about all that's been good with them.  We have used them to tie down a Jeep & a Polaris Rzr...and while the Jeep is at the very high end of the weight, the rzr isn't.  ALL of the tie offs are fraying & falling apart.
B00FSBE7MI|1|I have a 2014 Ram 1500 quad cab standard bed i bought the 6.5' as directed and it fits length wise but the width is just a lil to short its tight middle front n tight across the back once its all together cant close it from inside the tent
B0002UEOLO|5|Always good to have on hand
B000FQ75B6|2|I purchased this rack because the typical hitch type racks just extended the profile of my truck.  Having the bikes travel in the bed of the truck appealed to me.  Installation was a breeze and I liked that this rack came with a cable, just needed to purchase locks to secure the bikes & rack to the truck.  On first use, I noticed that when the bikes were loaded into the rack it interfered with the derailer on the rear tire.  This was mitigated by putting the bike in a higher gear.  No big deal, just needed to remember that for the future.  The very first turn I took out of the driveway, the bikes fell over.  Thinking I didn't secure them properly, I pulled over and adjusted.  Thinking I was good, I took off again.  On the second turn the bikes again fell over.  Fearing that this rack would break the derailed or bend a rim, I returned home and went back to the hitch rack and am returning this one.  I'm sure I could have used additional straps to secure the front of the bikes so they didn't fall over but that just adds more time & gear to both load and unload the bikes, in my opinion, defeating the whole purpose of what I was looking for in this rack.
B001G6PIYA|5|Great product! Excellent
B00CMX20H4|5|Works great on my motorcycle. Spend a little extra if you're serious about having a loud horn.
B000C57S6C|4|fit and works better than factory
B00TZ8HT5M|5|Molon Labe.
B003VAWUKE|5|Awesome arrived quickly in good shape happy!
B0087NAZM0|4|pretty good bike to bike comm and radio to both head sets work great. I can not pair with my Garmin which sux but they work great for everything else.
B000EQP9JC|5|Great, thanks
B000JZY4KI|5|Fit and work great
B00YY7M4AO|5|I have a 2010 Jaguar and out of the blue the check engine light will come on. Autozone and other parts stores are no longer keen to clear the warning for you which means either waiting days in the hope that nothing bad is happening and that it will reset itself or filling the trunk with cash and going to the Jag dealer. This gizmo worked like a charm. Plugged right in, was detected by my Android tablet and started giving me more information than I could ever use. I downloaded the Torque Pro app for $5 but there are other apps around if that one does not appeal to you. Small form factor and a couple of lines of instruction to get it working right out of the box, it couldn't be easier.
B00F5MCL14|2|Did not fit my standard hose fittings, as the ad said it would.<br />Build quality does look good though. Item was returned
B00J3NPOI8|1|Looked good but poorly made. Ripped when we were putting it on.
B0009I4TUA|2|Installation was pretty straightforward but the product failed soon after installation.  I bought this for towing a utility trailer (under 1500#) which gets occasional use.  The first CURT T-Connector failed about 3 months.  I was able to get quick response via their web site support and received a replacement unit.  I used a few more times before winter without problem.  I recently took my trailer out of storage but could not get the CURT T-Connector to work (all leads read 12v).  I submitted a support ticket a couple of weeks ago and waiting for response.  Given the short lifespan of the units, I have to give low marks but it was easy enough to install.
B003V0GG18|5|I got this to have a rubbish collector in the front of my Mini. Some of the others I looked at, while less expensive, seemed to be cheaply made. For what it's worth, this is less expensive now on my Mini dealer's website.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Strap allows you to hang it from the back of the front seats, or around the gear shift.<br />- Sturdy construction<br />- Velcro bottom allows for easy emptying<br />- Easy to wash<br /><br />As an aside, it's funny that Amazon tells me &#34;This does not fit your 2015 Mini Cooper&#34;. It's a trash bag for goodness sake, not a custom seat cover.
B003UYYGWQ|5|These are excellent straps for keeping shovels, pitchforks, etc. riding smoothly on your quad/side by side!
B00T2GT9L4|5|This works amazing for charging batteries, the LED is bright and pulsates to grab someone's attention, and it came fully charged in a neat case that fits below my seat in the car.  I highly recommend this for emergencies.
B0002SPC2G|5|great applicator
B00NLJ02ZA|2|This was listed as 'jumbo' that fits most SUV's etc.  I have a 2015 Toyota Highlander and it was too small.  It would keep falling down even with band over rearview mirror.  Now, with that being said, if it DID fit, I probably would have liked it due to the back/silver sides and keeping the sun out.  I ended up giving it away to someone.
B00ANZW28U|3|a bit small for my Sportage but its doing the job.
B000H0RCTK|5|So far the product works as expected.
B00JCHNDVA|5|Looks great
B00FBS1MVW|5|just what i needed
B004NJ4W9Y|5|Awesome light output. I use it for my work truck which is constantly used for construction. Good price as well, can't find led lightbars this cheap. Well you can, but not as bright and not weatherproof like this one.
B008G3KG70|5|Easy to install and very bright! It makes my truck look years younger.
B0024E669E|1|It only last for a year after the warranty expired.
B000ALDR4U|5|It was vry helpful,to replace the old one ,it is good
B000BZJ9Q0|5|Exact fit
B0002UQATS|5|Great Product, my husband loves to wax our cars now.
B00GYDBPL0|5|Just as expected. Love it
B00YY7M4AO|5|works.great does more that the 200 computer i had bought 6 months ago.......26 dollars can get better than that
B00THRJPVW|4|Doesn't block any precipitation at all. Effectively only a sun cover, and even that is iffy.  You'd be better off just buying a $10 tarp from a local hardware store.   Edit: Was contacted by the manufacturer, this cover is meant to be a dust cover. They are willing to ship out to me a waterproof cover, which is good customer service, and I'll update this review again with a link to a review of the waterproof cover. For what it says it is (a dust cover) - it does work.
B00449PUD0|5|Good
B00X6S10C0|5|Looks good and was easy to install
B00AN91GEW|5|Great Price
B00TZ8HT5M|2|Came off first time it rained
B00CFCI99K|5|Great Floor Mats.  With two kids, the carpeted mats got dirty quick.  These were a great alternative, they look good, and easy to clean.
B008CLPMNO|4|Installed this on my jeep. Took me slightly longer than 15 minutes but I am immediately noticing gains in fuel efficiency. Worth the price.
B00VLMNLU2|5|Quality product for my car.
B000AMBOI0|5|Works great.
B001O0CI3M|1|Send me too left sides. Missing my right one
B008A1C4RI|5|Perfect fit. Went in easy-squeezy. (2002 Jag X-type).
B0001ZTI0W|5|A + product
B003IOITIK|4|Like it
B009XFDYNS|5|What it was said to be.
B0031BUBDG|5|after doubting the stock original HD primary self adjusting tensioner was doing a good job, i replaced it with a manual adjust tensioner. which made problems worse.<br /><br />reading about the Hayden tensioner sounded like the most logical, innovative way of keeping primary chain tension at its best.  read many good reviews of this tensioner on HD forum online.<br /><br />i could not be happier.  the whirring chain noise i experienced was gone. very quiet now.<br />gear shifts are less clunk, more click.  seem gentler.<br />i even lost some vibration. more smooth riding.<br /><br />i rode this 07 electraglide less. rode my 13 streetglide more because of the noise, vibration more prevalent on the older bike.<br />after the Hayden, i now ride the 07 more, 13 less.  the 07 smoothness, quiet rivals the newness of the 13.<br /><br />can't say enough good things about this tensioner
B000PEPCGI|3|Definitively could be better, But its just a rubber pad.  I expected it to somehow hold the 3m wet dry sandpaper to it.  Since the wet dry have a velcro type backing.
B008SOQOLE|5|great!
B0014H19YY|5|nice on my benz..
B001AGE60I|5|Good price fast ship
B00OFBMKR6|4|As desribed
B002ZBWKAU|4|Work great the only thing is a littler slow but is better to waste 1 dollar everytime temperature change and Psi on the go down
B00TDMZB00|2|The information at time of purchase stated this lamp was compatible with my 2013 jeep wrangler. To install it I had to trim away some of the base material in order for it to securely fit.  Illumination is not what I expected.  They are ok as driving lights but give little in the way of added lighting.
B004BTOVC4|4|very good
B00310X12U|5|Perfect fit!
B008OE42K8|5|This Lucas oil sticks to everything

B00GQOGQMA|1|wires cought fire and were smoking right after i hooked them up
B0035R5QIG|5|Fit just like oem shock but comes with lifetime warranty.
B0002LWGZ4|5|quality product--works great!
B0009IR0FG|5|Great quality product. Use this in both of our vehicles when my hubby does the oil changes himself. Glad that its something we can order through subscribe and save, so we can just forget about it and it just shows up when we need it!
B00R3LYF7S|4|I like that it folds flat, and can be used half a time if needed. Cardboard base.
B004W8MQA8|5|It works as advertised and very happy with it.
B000CP8H0I|5|Just what I was looking for at a good price ..
B001NI7KE2|5|Very nice, heavy duty - should hold most of clothing.
B000E7SY16|2|Hooks break easily
B00MW8G99O|5|Works great.  Easy to program.
B000J4645M|1|very cheep returned
B00B603NXY|1|did not fit they come off easily
B004LF13GA|4|Not an exact replacement for my existing unit.  After a little sawing it did fit in the old location.  The install instructions were somewhat lacking.  But  I did get it installed correctly and the unit is working good
B00WAOS1BY|4|works great
B00G78GE0O|4|They work.
B00GCIHZDO|5|Looks great!
B0002JM69W|1|seat came apart within three weeks. IT IS JUNK.
B00U3BRONW|5|These were perfect for me.  I was looking for one where the front came to about the half way mark on the flares, had a lowered winch plate so it isn't as noticeable, and had the brush guard that was as close to the middle of the grille as possible.  This product met and exceeded my expectations.  Very good product for a very nice price.
B00KTIW9AC|5|was a perfect fit and was in good condition when received
B000C7XUA8|5|It was an exact match for the original Ford part. It was easy to install. It's worked like a charm.
B000NSL3DC|5|good price
B002303KNE|4|Ordered on 5/26/15 with an estimated delivery date of 6/1-6/4/15.  The item did not arrive until 6/8/15.  The product works as expected.  Delivery date was a fail.
B000BRQ0TW|5|Excellent
B001LEIMAO|5|fast excellent very satisfied
B002ITBPI2|5|I love it
B004VJMEEQ|1|Big mirror that doesn't see a thing. The screen is so dark that nothing is visible. Don't buy this one
B00GWFPQCE|5|You won't be disappointed!
B000BXKZUQ|5|cleans as expected.
B00IRBPCF2|5|First day out with it and i adjusted our bikes and it has all of the sizes! so small it has shrunk the weight of my tool bag by 8-10 lbs! Very happy and every road cyclist should have one!
B00X8EW2AQ|4|It does the job,  however it was a bit off size,  but easy to install,  it is put right on top of the broken glass,
B006EGAIII|5|Just as described, works as designed, cost efficent, happy customer!
B0009IQZEI|5|These are very hard to find so when we use the last one I order a couple more thanks
B000LG9M1Q|2|The company should have known that there apparently is ALWAYS trouble using their directions to set up the key fob on the 2001 Toyota Camry.<br />I just purchased this car from someone and it didn't have a key fob...the company should have know that the 2001 Camry doesn't need one with a trunk button also...I would not have purchased a key fob with a trunk opener if I had known that the 2001 Toyota Camry didn't have electronic trunk opener. I had to take it to an Audio dealer to get it to work....and pay another $26 ! The doors now work though....lol
B00BTL9ZOG|5|Just what i was looking for thank you
B00IKW5HV2|5|Was easy to put on, didn't change my ride at all, only made it better.  I put it on my 2010 Xterra off-road.  I would definitely use this again for future vehicles.
B0000AY88Z|5|Works in my ATV !
B003R2MG2S|5|They worked out great and look awesome!!!
B00GRHSU5C|4|Just what I wanted works perfect.  Helps out with my jeep hair when I get to work.  Only complaint is the center Velcro was off center and unusable.  Didn't really effect the rest of the cover its just annoying to look up and see.
B00TEG3224|5|Super high quality stickers that look great on anything. If you're into cars, you need to purchase this.
B000LY7H7Y|4|fast shipping easy to install
B008PH5RRG|5|These bushings are great! Used them on my 370Z when my stock bushings popped and leaked fluid all over my exhaust.
B0072W6CXI|2|Awful bulbs... They don't project a smooth light onto the ground.
B004500M8G|1|Did not work one little bit.  Started with one small dribble at rear corner of four cylinder Volvo block.  Still dribbles at same rate.
B003YCEMUA|1|These towels were terrible and were destroyed after one wash. I ended up having to throw them away after 1 month.
B00UUAU1ZY|5|Terrific.exceeded my expectations.
B00M8UDCBO|5|Great looking helmet (I think) tinted retractable visor is sooooo cool (I think). Fits me great. It kind of whistles a bit at higher speeds / stronger winds, but that might be me not opening / closing the vents correctly. Happy with purchase otherwise.
B0012DKIAQ|3|It's ight
B004D5MQOG|5|number one
B000CIV70W|5|number one
B001C0ERII|5|You will be happy with this purchase trust me
B00GSAUHB8|5|Has a nice pouch which it folds up compactly into.  Update: lowering rating from 5 stars to 3 stars due to difficulty with folding shade into pouch. I thought that after a few weeks of owning it I'd figure out an easy way to fold it and place into the pouch, but alas, such a method has escaped me. Twisting the shade is the best way I've found, but wires running through the shade material do not like to fold after being twisted and tend to form their own defiant loops uncondusive to fitting the shade into the compact pouch. A lot of times after spending 5-10 mins in the parking lot looking like a goofball unsuccessfully trying to fold it, I usually just give up and toss it in the back seat.  2nd edit: raising back to 5 stars because I found a not-too-ackward way to fit the shade into the pouch. The key is to twist it twice and curl it up in the smaller circle size that fits the pouch!
B009S9RO9Y|3|Smaller then what I thought but my husband loves it.
B00K1NQ2CQ|5|Fit perfectly on my 2005 Colorado.
B00IEO6YAO|2|looks nice on the front seats, but does not fit back. doesn't have holes for the middle belt or the buckles.
B0070Y36WI|1|They don't fit my 2007 Honda accord!
B001JT5JVQ|5|Best thing on the market
B000BUOSGG|5|This think is awesome.  I really like the compact size and how thought out this is.  We also got the dish pan that this fits into perfectly for storage, and we love the complete setup.
B002308GSS|4|Good product, the only reason for the four-star is because I had it sitting on the handlebar for a while without the handle grip or clamp assembly installed yet and one of the tabs that holds the cable broke off and I had to buy another one. Mostly my fault, but a little brittle. Still I would buy again.
B008CE0R5E|5|Love this wheel chock, but wish it was cheaper.  Smelled HORRIBLE when I opened the box, so it immediately went outside under the trailer.  I did find similar product at Harbor Freight for about 1/2 the price.  If this was cheaper I'd buy more, but I'm headed to HF to buy these giant hunks of smelly rubber.
B0016KAB0M|5|Pluged right in
B000JFHMPC|4|The sensitivity adjustment is a nice feature.
B004INIUQ6|5|Now I can leave the windows open a crack and not get rain in the car.
B006O87UYQ|5|So far so good
B000X03VZI|5|Good kit for the price. K tool usually has great stuff
B007NNK3D6|5|Excelent boots
B00EI6CKVE|5|This lasted an entire New England winter and is still going strong! Follow directions!
B007PP0BDO|4|Easy to install, the bolt ends allow for easy mounting, would have been nice if it came with nuts.  Can't speak for durability as I've just installed them.
B000MZT2FW|5|I bought this gauge through a local auto parts store, it matches the interior of my jeep perfectly. Works great, very easy to read, bright even illumination. Can't beat this electrical gauge at this price point.
B00SZK1YMU|5|amazing, great product, bright and easy to install. love it
B005N53CG6|1|VERY DISAPPOINTED! This was navy blue, not black. I will not go through the hassle and return it, but if you're looking for a black steering wheel cover this is NOT it.
B00KTIK1U2|5|Recieved my product ahead of time,works great
B00T36QPUG|5|Big difference! I can feel it in the acceleration and it seems as the engine is breathing easier.
B008BX8GPY|5|Works  great
B00NTGV8DU|5|Out standing
B000VKTUJG|5|As described. Easy install.
B000GKKTQE|5|VERY GOOD
B0031XQRNW|5|Fit perfectly. Thanks.
B0015R85MC|5|Looks great and easy install.  Bought this for my daughter's 2010 Civic.  Came with both long and short screws, which was nice.  It slid right on and installed within a few minutes.
B005UGKDRY|5|Pretty good stuff! Just flushed my 400awhp wrx's brakes with it, higher temp boiling point than dot 3 and most dot 4's and can mix with them too if you just have to bleed for a brake job.
B00JJX1TA4|4|They work great I installed on my 1989 Nissan Sunny
B00G620ZVU|5|Two of the driving lights were mounted on my Harley Road King and work well on the mountain roads watching for dear.  The other two will be mounted in the grill of my 91 Lincoln for the sane reason.
B009B9FOWU|5|This sun shield feels like it's definitely of better quality than the universal fit at your local box store variety. It's thicker and of sturdy material. You don't want to carelessly bend it (although it may take a good karate type action). The fit is just about perfect while keeping in mind it couldn't be any better w/out its own set of drawbacks. Explanation: for my vehicle, when you initially slide the bottom down the dash it is a tight fit and when you raise the top to clear the mirror it is also tight (don't force it or you'll need to adjust your mirror). But when you shift it into place there is a 1/2-1&#34; gap on both sides between the a pillar. Any bigger to minimize the gap and you probably wouldn't even be able to get it to fit, so it's really as good as it's going to get.<br /><br />I do wish it came w/ the cover- currently using the box it shipped in to keep it from being &#34;carelessly&#34; damaged when not in use.<br /><br />The real test will be how much cooler will it be when I park the truck at work in the sun all day. Will update later
B00PX6DV84|5|Great Fit Great Price
B000KKLLFS|5|Do their job.
B007OW6EWU|5|I took them to a dealer and they installed them on my van.
B007TY0G1I|5|Easy to install. Looks great and is a good replacement choice
B00B63BBBW|5|Fast cheap, TY
B00GMRAKVE|5|it's pk...
B000OAZD2Q|5|Hey all I know order it 2 and half days later it was here and it a very nice piece of art installed in a matter of minutes with no problems. Thanks.
B00144BAGY|3|It fit my motor and works well
B00O8ZNJ2Y|5|They worked out great, they were a direct fit for the factory lights and are extremely bright
B00J97UDD4|5|It's an oil filter! It filters oil!
B00HSCN7OO|5|all good
B00C2TETI6|3|Gets nice a hot with a big tank, a bit hard to maintain on when using a small tank.
B00G6188EM|5|PERFECT
B007NNUCDW|5|These units were exaclty what I was looking for....
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works very well.  I used to have this type of sunshade, but it was in two separate panels.  They always left gaps where too much sun would come in and not serve the purpose very well.  These panels are connected--far fewer gaps.  No, they don't block as much sun as the accordian type shades, but those are bulky and difficult to store unless you have a large vehicle.  I wanted something that would store compactly when not in use and this fits the bill.  I have been using this a couple of weeks in South Florida, and definitely notice that my car's interior is cooler.  Fits my 2012 Acura TSX.<br /><br />Edited to say there seems to be some drastic price fluctuations on this item.  I got no response from the seller when I inquired about a refund of the price difference when I saw it drop by $10 within a week of buying it.
B007OW603I|5|Quality OEM parts
B00VEK67VG|5|I was torn between these and the Weathertech version of these. The Weathertech set is a lot more expensive though, and only has a three year warranty, Husky is not only cheaper and still made in America, but they have a LIFETIME warranty not just a couple of years. Precision fit for my 2015 Mustang and looks phenomenal!
B005C5AJ1S|5|Exactly what I was needing.  Fast delivery.  Thank you very much.
B007NMJO8M|5|outstanding fit perfect.
B00OTYHGSC|5|I am particularly happy with the service. I had initially received an incompatible remote but when I contacted the seller, they were pretty helpful and offered to exchange this one with a compatible remote. And it was sent to me within a week. And the one I received is working perfectly fine. Easy to  program and effective to use. Thanks to the seller.
B00JEUHPO6|5|Worked great - good product
B000CGF7GE|5|Fit perfect and good quality
B00UUJP47K|5|Shipped as advertised.  Seems to be good quality.
B00KTIUG5C|2|These don't seem to work very well with my daughter's 2005 Escape. They will lock the doors from a few feet away (no further) but will not unlock. I tried programming them several times.
B00LUSTQEM|1|Quality was terrible. I had to plug them in backward to work, then I couldn't put them in because backward plug didn't clear the housing.<br />One light felt broken from the start, shifting on it's base.
B004LWVEKS|5|This little charger brought my motorcycle's battery to full charge over night! It's super easy to use. It's my first bike and the first time I had to charge the battery all by myself. I'm always afraid of messing up with all things electric, and I had no idea about what voltage to use during charging as it's rubbed off my battery. This charger tells you when the voltage is too high or too low so you can adjust. It took about 5-6 hours to fully charge, and now my bike runs like new. Even the inexperienced users can use it in no time. Highly recommend.
B000O51VJ0|5|With the fire burn bans this has made camping enjoyable. Absolutely love it.<br /><br />Pros: Nice flame, warm, light, hose lenght, and small,<br /><br />Cons: Loud (breather valve hisses), small
B00T74VX24|1|this thing caught on fire and burnt my shop down
B000C2Q25I|1|Not even close. Should've read reviews first.
B003179N52|5|I use this for desert dirtbike riding. It's light and has a lot of tools that can be used from get you home In a pinch
B00N3WJ7WE|5|Great.
B008VGDYNU|5|Love this phone holder for our motorcycle! Works great and the price is like half from motorcycle shops!
B007VRAP3M|5|Excellent quality, arrived on time, kit came complete
B003XU6D0A|5|This is the second pair of these that I have owned.  Very comfortable gloves and I love the gel inserts.  I think the gel makes it less tiring on the hands on longer rides.
B00I8V8XWA|5|Great kit, fast shipping thanks
B001N2O3PM|5|Looks really sharp on my Beetle!
B00QN8P2N8|5|Item was great.  Good structural construction and appreciated by the Eagle Scout who received it.
B000CPIMTO|5|Brake fluid. For brakes
B002MQDY4O|5|Fit just right
B000FIY08U|3|So far so good. Only used once.
B0095ZKA06|4|Mediam quality works good but needs programmable temp range
B009G4Y9RG|1|Don't buy was on the  Vehicle for 8 mounts  and went bad gave me the run around and told me I was  responsible for the return shipping
B0026JCNJE|1|The electronic controller lasted about 3 weeks before failing.  Current direction from the manufacturer is that I will need to uninstall the whole system and send back for replacement as they &#34;do not carry spare parts&#34;
B000NBWCFC|5|Good value. Switch at the base is a little finicky. It's easy to confuse the end where the lens is as the on/off switch, as many flashlights<br />of this design have. You can turn it on and off by twisting the lens end, but the smaller lanyard end is preferred. Not bright enough for<br />daytime use. I waited until complete darkness to inspect for leaks.  Photo shows my high pressure power steering hose.
B001TNT4UY|3|just finished the installation of a &#34;Bed Saver&#34; on my B&W 3600 companion and thought I would share my experience. Recognizing that at times I have a tendency to be easily distracted, I thought this would be cheap insurance in the event that I'm daydreaming while unhooking my trailer.<br /><br />The first thing that alarmed me was while reading the installation instructions. I know, I know-I'll turn in my man card first thing Monday. Anyway, three or four steps down, the manufacturer tells us that this product is only rated to 4,000 pounds of pin weight, and I will have a super bad day if I first screw up and actually use this thing, but then it fails and screws up my bed and trailer anyway. Well that 4000 pound rating certainly won't work on a 41' DRV, so I called Blue Ox and talked with one of their technical support employees, who spoke to the guy next to him, who then contacted someone with an answer. I was reassured that the model ordered for the companion is rated for the same pin weight of the hitch-6,250 pounds. I wasn't exactly filled with confidence, especially when I continued reading the instructions and despite the claim of &#34;no-drill installation,&#34; drilling 1/2&#34; (17/32&#34; per their instructions. 1/2&#34; wasn't an issue, if you're curious) holes into the companion was required.<br /><br />I hmmed and hawed about this for a bit, and eventually decided to just do it recognizing that the warranty associated with the legs connecting the head of the hitch to the base would be sacrificed. I'm confident those items are not expensive, especially when compared to a damaged bed and fiver. I've seen a few beds crunched on trucks at our campground, apparently people trying to unhook their fiver without the front legs down is more common than I thought it would be. Heck one of the delivery drivers at our dealership dropped a DRV on his truck. Whoops!<br /><br />Installation wasn't difficult. If you can drill four holes into some thick metal you'll be fine. In hindsight I may have benefitted from buying some tapping fluid or unpacked the stuff I already had in the storage unit, but at the time I didn't feel it would be worth it for four holes and didn't want a big mess all over the bed.<br /><br />The bed saver takes up less room than I thought it would, and I'm sure having the hitch head situated as far forward as possible does help a bit.<br /><br />At this point, I suppose there is nothing more to say. Hopefully I will never be unfortunate/absent-minded enough to experience using this device, but if I do I will definitely report back.
B004GD0R9Q|5|Absolutely perfect fit. Certified as well. Installed in less than 5 minutes and you can't tell this from the factory original.
B00PMEJQB8|5|worked like a charm no problem anymore
B00CZDQU3G|5|Awesome
B006TMMPMY|5|Perfect fit
B00GYZP708|5|Gave it for a present and apparently that person likes this so I am happy.
B000Q8E5PC|5|Perfect fit in my 2013 silverado lt. I now have full dic information and settings customization. Simply remove the old dash piece,  connect the factory harness to the buttons and install.  Simple 10 minute job!
B00HE6CI58|5|Nice bulbs. Great price. Fast shipping. Great service. Need I say more?
B000N3N4LG|5|Just as posted rubber end cap.
B007LIB94K|5|Nice feel and sharp looking. Was too tight to get on my Nissan Altima but after I let it sit in my hot car for awhile I got it on.<br />Hope this helps, you could also use a hair dryer to loosen it up.
B008IK7TSA|5|carb was very useful and cheap. good quality and bolted right up. arrived the next day with Amazon Prime. recommend the seller. FYI installed on a 110cc mini dune buggy (ROKETA)
B000JFJLP6|4|Works great just a little on the heavy side.
B00WW0LIOS|4|excellent product.. easy to install.. very very bright. On off switch could be a little more rugged . Maybe a rocker switch.
B004TC3D18|4|Works great for the standard base black tops (non-painted). Easy to apply.
B00MN963JS|5|Pretty pleased, my husband rides a motorcycle, and he wanted this. He likes the style with the skeleton. He was also very pleased with the wind protection it provided him while riding, he said it is thin material so he doesnt know how it will be in the winter, but he likes it during the warmer months. I will update how it does in the winter :) i purchased this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Thank You!
B007HBQ22K|5|Fast shipping.  Product works great!
B001DH2U3E|5|It does what it's supposed to do and it fit a 2009 kia spectra
B00A15X9I4|1|This Item does not fit a 2002 Chevy Suburban LS. After trying to install it, then taking it no a shop to see if they could figure out why it could not be installed we called the manufacture. My 2002 Chevy Suburban has rear air controls and the double visors. Amazon says it will fit the suburban but the manufacture says otherwise. Now its been to long for the return and I'm stuck with it.
B003VGHATO|5|Perfect in my Toyota Corolla 2009.
B00CST9BC4|5|Part was as advertised -- fit and finish was ok
B00E3YK3CO|5|Wow!  Perfect fit and finish.  Paint match by factory color code was exact... and not a flaw in it.  Looks and fits 100% OEM, even it it's not.  I am very impressed!  I bought this to handle a long overdue DIY bumper cover replacement on my daughter's '09 Civic EX-L sedan.  Let me tell you, it was a breeze... none of the hassle of trying to find a local shop to paint a raw one, and it was really easy to install.  I've installed a front bumper cover on my BMW 3-series (e46 330CI) which was not so easy.  The Honda Civic was a different story entirely.  Once I had all the collateral damage taken care of (fender liner, etc...) and lower grill and such installed in the bumper cover itself, it took about 10-minutes start to finish to actually put it on the car.  I would recommend getting a pack of the plastic push-rivets that attach the underside, though, because the old ones are tough to reuse when you pull them (8mm, I think, and can be found on Amazon for about $5 a pack/40 vs $2 each at the stealership - you'll need about 8 of them).  I'd also recommend having a forked trim removal tool handy to get the old push-rivets out with.  Anyway, bottom-line:  You CAN do-it-yourself.  Probably saved about $500-$600 over a body shop repair, maybe a lot more than that!  Edit:  Ah, I forgot to mention the vendor.  Top notch!  I was very impressed by the confirmation email they sent me.  Not only did it acknowledge the order and verify that they had received my color-code info (which has to be sent separately from the order), they also did a great job of explaining the process and the amount of time it would take to ship the order.  These are paint-to-order and require a few days to cure before they can ship without risking damage to still-soft paint by the packing materials.  And it was packed unbelievably well.  Must have used a whole roll of bubble wrap!  Anyway, they also did the most delicately diplomatic job in that email of essentially saying, if you don't have time to waitfor them to do it right they understand and can cancel the order.  Sounds rough when I say it, but not when they did.  I only wish I could write so well.  It just made perfect sense, was not offensive, and made me feel even more assured that they care about the quality of the paint work I would receive.
B002CXH0YM|5|Worked perfect on 95 Dodge Ram 2500!
B002LEEY00|5|Short and sweet: This is a tastefully designed license plate of excellent quality and considerably heavy.<br /><br />The license plate itself it well made, carefully crafted, and elegantly designed.<br /><br />My only concern is theft, so i may create a more secure way to secure it to my vehicle.<br /><br />Will follow up in the next several months.
B001UFQBAM|5|As advertised... worked as expected.
B00VNBDOV2|5|Installed on a 07 Avalanche Lt with brights and are great . They are pretty bright. Hard to tell cause I have HID 8k in my lows but the brights  do help and don't need any warming up . Which is great. Fit in my truck great so I was glad for that. They Looked big at first. Ya they aren't HIDs but they are  nice still .
B004J36IKU|5|The description sucks but I ordered it anyway and it's everything you need to rebuild your carbs and so far so good.
B000EDQR50|5|I had to replace a few of these on my camper, and these are a perfect replacement. I noticed I have to couple more to replace soon, and I'll be getting more of these.
B00Y4CYXGM|5|fast and easy install
B000LBD32A|5|Easy install and works as advertised.
B0062NHSKE|5|great product on a great little alternator
B007RW1K1W|5|Half the price of the dealer. My truck runs great.
B003RF4H72|5|Mustang seats really are the way to go!
B000N9PG9I|5|I was a little concerned when I ordered because I had no motor serial number. The boat was a 1988 so I assumed the motor was too, but pictures of parts matched 1989 motor. Pictures were right, parts were right and it went together easier than I thought. Been working fine. Didn't lose a weekend!
B00GHT8CV2|5|Perfect fit for 1998 Ford F150 with 4.6L. Sure helps clean up a dirty cooling system.
B0014B9OR4|5|Good Ceramic Disk Brake Pads at a great price. That will keep my wheels clean.
B00U8O8ABO|1|Fit with a little effort.  The coolant level light remained on after changing out the expansion tank.  The problem seems to be with the mechanical float located deep inside the tank and not the replacement sensor. I would recommend hooking the sensor up and testing the tank with an Ohm meter before installing,  This would have saved me a few hours of effort and $30 in fluid.  I plan to replace this unit with one from another vendor.
B000C5SGHC|5|If you know what part to order, this is the correct part.  The reviewers who said they were sent the wrong part probably confused the left and right sides of the vehicle.  Once we were able to remove the old sensor (not an easy task - had to saw the top off the old sensor), and re-threaded the hole,  the sensor screwed right in and worked like a charm.  My gas mileage is much better now.  Used on a 2003 Toyota RAV4S.
B0041K13LA|5|I love these I bought 4 of them for a few of my vehicles we love them!
B00412YT8W|5|excellent it works perfectly
B002MEJB1Q|5|This work great perfect size trash bag
B002XM4ZTK|5|Make getting up and down wet, slippery steps a thing of the past. Also great for keeping dirt and grass out of the RV. The dog loves them, too!
B000BQT7IY|5|I already have a Cal-Van harmonic balancer puller model 189 that i've used since 1978.  The center bolt recently grew legs.  I searched all the stores and online, and just could not find a replacement.  So I ordered this one and let me say, it stands up just as strong as my old one.  Now I have 2 sets, and yes the center bolt fits both.  I had to purchase three 1/4x20 bolts @ #8 hardness to pull what I needed this for because, well there's just no way for Cal-Van to anticipate what size bolt everyone will need.  But the bolts that come with this set will fit almost any make/model vehicle's harmonic balancer and/or wheel puller.  All-in-all Cal-Van has a great product here and with the lifetime warranty, just let me say i've never had to use it.
B008K7V4PU|5|Perfect!
B0013FFPX8|5|perfect
B003Z49L2G|2|cheap, looks dump.  I wish I would not have bought these.
B00YVHGTBM|5|Great product and customer suppport. New updates and always looking to make it better.
B003978QGQ|5|As described. Best prices by far! Fast shipping. Thanks.
B00PF272W2|5|Works great... does leave lint
B00COYNZJ8|2|It showed up and one of the elastic straps that you use to fold it away is frayed and broken. The cardboard packaging was in rough shape as well. I know it didn't happen in transit because the shipping box was fine. It should still work but I payed for a new and intact product
B006O85Q5Q|5|Really nice chain. Only time will tell how long it lasts.
B001CF4UXU|5|Best stitched loops I have seen on any recovery strap.  High quality loop protection material.
B00CKRJI36|4|The Car seat cover fits well overall. I had some tough time fitting the Center Console which I felt is little smaller and it takes a lot of pulling and fiting to make it fit. Another area is the Holes for the Rear seat belts. It can be little smaller to push the Seat belt latch into it. Just make it little bigger by cutting off a little of the stitching it fits in easily. The best part is fitting the rear back covers, it has no strings at all, just few Velcros to make it sit right.<br /><br />Over all a good product.
B00M394FRA|5|Part shipped fast and was very easy to install. Hardest part was getting the old one out of the clip. Probably would have gone better if I had the proper tool to release the clip.
B000E2CVIS|5|Great product. And easy install.  My stock filter was a hard af to put on. This one came right on pretty tight with just hand tightening. I tightened it wit one flick of the wrench too just to make sure
B000SBCHCA|1|This was suggested with my Innova 3100, it wasn't needed and cost the amount it cost to ship it back for a refund.
B0024E5UVO|4|Seems a little cheap. But is working just fine. Is a lot nicer than having a solid color there
B00J4HLNC4|5|Awesome
B00NSN6PF0|3|Disappointed - but not done with installation, so I will update this review later, but in the meantime this is the only way to communicate with Parallax.  Picture shows breakers in the AC side of the unit, but there were no breakers supplied.  Locking nut on cover was broken upon arrival.
B00Z808L62|5|Love, love, love this!!!
B00JVUM5XA|4|Good quality bumper, fits my Polaris RZR 2013 well. I am satisfied with the product.
B00ACLPZ0C|5|I expected cheap material because these were so inexpensive, but boy was I wrong!!! These seat covers are absolutely wonderful and we love having them cover our leather seats in the summer!
B00B7GC50Y|1|Did not keep my battery charged. It was a waste of money.
B006ZVLFKW|3|It looks very similar to OEM. The location of the pressure switch on this accumulator is off from where is should be. When the pressure switch is installed, this unit cannot be installed because of the charcoal canister location on my 95 VW Jetta VR6. Otherwise, this product does seem well built and shipping was quick, along with a great price. I hope this helps.<br />***WILL NOT WORK ON 95 VW JETTA VR6***
B0062A7M2G|5|Awesome stuff. Good adhesive and looks great. Bought one, ran out, bought two more.
B0018RD3YE|2|did not fit
B007VHBGIU|2|A little scratched on delivery.
B00JGJGCV2|5|As title says, this is a good product.
B0026M9D80|4|Replaced stock rears in the wifes 09 Rav4 due to the extremely hard banging rear suspension.<br />Should have done it a lot sooner than 100k miles since it's been like this for probably 80k of them.<br /><br />Ride is much smoother and all the harshness/banging is gone.<br /><br />Vehicle rides completely different.
B007EXP826|5|Simple, effective weather stripping that works. Used this to provide an additional layer of protection under my Tonneau Cover lid (Undercover Flex).
B00CBYEHFM|5|This was so much better than my expectations!  I am delighted.
B0071QVHHG|5|Just what I was looking for...
B004Q6WD40|1|Broke right away
B0035BYQLA|5|Product arrived on time. Product is actually much better than I thought it was, very versatile, super easy to mount on my hitch rack and extremely well made.
B004RVSQX6|4|Just as described.
B007ZGBLNW|5|Great illumination, easy  to  install and excellent  price
B000TLL892|5|This is the thick compressable gasket, the one that stops manifold to head leaks.
B0045LA9OW|5|just as described
B00D9C2CDO|4|Worked great for our 2000 mile round trip.  Drove through and had to stop during a major thunder boomer in South Dakota.  No water got in the bag, everything was bone dry.  Looks like a growth on your car if not filled to capacity, which would be a major undertaking.  But it did the job.
B00FQW7V4U|5|Used it on my black mail box.
B00K0SCNMK|5|Fits my 2011 f150 perfectly. Exactly matching the tan interior and provides great air flow.
B00KTOE0RQ|5|It's a good parts.
B00NB3R5DI|5|Great
B002M59LXI|5|work fine
B00JBID6Z8|4|OK.  It's not leather and smells bad (synthetic).  But what can I say about $30 steering wheel. It looks pretty good and feels great.<br />Size is small as my Lotus Elise MOMO steering wheel and feels just like it.<br />Metal rings on steering wheel ware too sharp on the edges and almost injure my fingers so I had to grind them down smooth and now it's no problem.
B00SVE0R0A|5|I have hearing problems and I heard them at 100 kms/hour (65 mph) so I'm sure with somebody with a normal hearing<br />will hear them at 120 kms (75 mph) My friends say they have a clean sound. I wish I could find a bass module I could add to them<br />as there is no bass. Seems to be the norm.
B00CI8XPFY|5|I didn't know so many do not know Totoro!
B00JS8FCSA|5|Easy install, great quality.
B005FNKSMW|1|Not the size I needed
B00IKPEDZU|5|VERY GOOD
B001EMRQBE|4|Very sticky back-to-back tape. Fits perfectly. I just wish it was the same thickness as its companion bedrug in the bed. Hence the 4 stars...
B00AN5S1TY|5|second set of these I have purchased, one for my Avalanche and another for my Corvette.  No problems, great stopping power, no fade and best of all the pulsating from worn/warped rotors is gone because everything is new.
B0016I8E1M|2|Product seems to be well made, but my order didn't come with any bolts or the two silver pieces that go across the top. For my troubles I got a $5 credit to go buy my own material to make it right. Had to buy quite a few nuts and bolts and metal straps to make it work.
B00CIY6TJ2|4|Good quality it was shipped right away
B0009XXMVW|5|perfect fit no problem
B000HACYNY|4|I really like this. Very comfortable and allows me to reach the middle of the windshield on Acadia. It needs a wider scraper at the end that is what prevents me from giving it 5 stars. works great, easy to hold with thick gloves on and it's a good design that flows well with my body movement when I scrap ice.
B0051D6C80|3|Great Catback but it is not even on both sides. One side is sticking out more than the other side.
B00GSAUHB8|5|This has been invaluable in the hot Florida sun. It is very effective and, when not in use, folds up neatly and compactly.
B0022ZL8C0|3|It did not have the red agv letters I expected. That was the only thing that was upsetting.
B008XF4ZQ4|4|It works, but needed considerable de-burring. Tool paths clearly visible and able to be felt, does not look as finely finished as in the photos. Meh.
B002HSQK9I|5|Excellent fit, seems well made.
B00HJAMBI8|5|works with my electronic throttle controller and scangauge 2.
B00ID1FW7O|5|These speakers were very easy to hook up.They work great, I've been using them for three months with no issues. Sounds is great.. nice and loud. I run with a windshield, fairly loud cobra custom pipes I can still hear my music at 80 mph. So much better then singing to myself.
B000CN7B5C|4|Purchased to replace the tie rod end dust boot at the Pittman arm of my 2001 F250. Amazon said the part wouldn't fit but it stretches. The first photo is the original moog boot all torn up. The second is after replacing the boot.
B0009IQZH0|5|Works Great
B000C42RBO|5|Excellent shocks. Saved 140 buying them here instead of advanced auto parts.
B00KTIQAZW|5|Works great. Whole lot better deal than the dealership, they want $100.00. This is the exact same thing, and I had no problem having the dealership program it.
B00B90PPGY|2|It is ok
B00P8DFA5E|5|Awesome coverage. I love these liners.
B00K779ECG|5|Fit perfectly
B00OK8VVR4|5|way to go guys what a product not only is it super easy to apply it looks like it is part of the vehicle i could not be more impressed thank you guys makes my 2002 custom s10 look like its brand new  2 BIG THUMBS UP
B00B5XG4EW|5|Good product
B00B9HFO0Y|5|Thank you.
B002VVGPE6|5|First of all very fast shipping & a great price.<br />I have read a lot of reviews on Klockwerks windshield prior to purchase but after reading reviews was still a bit skeptical. The  Klockweks 8.5 windshield arrived and after a very easy install went out for a 35 mile ride. Well the end result is I am very satisfied, Klockwerks talks about clean air and I'm here to tell you the windshield is better than I ever hoped for, I am 6 ft and there is no wind buffering, I don't normally ride without a helmet but for 5 miles wore a baseball cap ( bill to the front ) and sunglasses with no problem. Klockwerks I just want to say &#34;Thank You&#34;. The windshield is everything you describe. Trust me I have tried multitudes of Harley and after market windshield and none will compete with Klockwerks.
B00KMOQ78I|3|Was not long enough to slip into the stock X pipe on my '12 SRT. I had to buy wide muffler clamps to install. Decent otherwise but they are an inch too short.
B000BUOSGG|5|Great works perfect in our camper
B00HRXNLIG|5|This thing worked perfectly. I was having an issue that as soon as I hit the AUX button on my stock radio it would only stay on AUX for 3 seconds then go to the radio. At first i played with the cord and i could get the AUX to twitch on and off so I thought it was the cord. I put in a new cord and still had the same issue. Replaced this and worked like a charm. Took 1 minute.
B000C9FXR4|5|Exact same cylinders removed from my 91 Caprice
B005NLQAHS|3|Performs as expected, don't have time to fully exercise due to home change but have good expectations.
B00DIH44QS|5|Super bright.  Love it!!
B0092QCOIO|5|These were exactly what I needed
B0015PI7A4|3|The unit works as advertised but is difficult to select test. The book is comprehensive if hard to read and understand. Read the manual several times and try to memorize all the options. If used often it may be a great tool, but for occasional use it is a pain to use.
B00C8UKFIM|5|Having never using beads for balancing I decided to give these a try. Shipping was very fast, price was really good and the use of product could not be easier. Upon receiving the beads the balancing of the front and rear tire of my 95 vf750 Honda magna, completely smooth from takeoff to 110 so all around I am a completely satisfied customer and I recommend them to anyone
B001NAP2FO|5|Perfect fit for my KTM.
B00MWBXWFK|5|great stuff
B00DNISOZE|1|do not fit right cheap cheap cheap do not BUY!!!!
B000N5TI3W|5|I installed these on my BMW R1150GS to facilitate future removal of the fuel tank. Work well.
B000C847YU|5|Worked perfect and the 1 side of adhesive is to help keep it in place during installation. And you still need gasket maker for it to seal right a piece of paper isn't gonna do it. I have these on all my jeeps and none leak.
B003RXU4DU|5|Use this In My 28 Model A Hot Rod Fits and Looks Great It is The 2nd One Only Because Cause Going to use This One For The Back Seat Thanks For Quick Return Car Show This Weekend.
B00C8C745M|5|Just perfect!!!
B0016HW8C4|5|Did not need returned<br />Thanks
B00U1U5NI8|1|Vibrated so much I took it off after ten minutes
B00J11NOR0|5|Really great product! Helps my car tremendously!
B00Z8YTFQS|5|Worked great!
B003VAUFU6|5|Very solid piece of equipment!
B001V2P87G|5|I have to say I've come to love Whelen products, with it's overly simplified a huge bulky American designs :)<br />As there are few products today that actual say &#34;Made in America&#34;, and produced by the hands of it's homegrown hard working citizens,<br />I can probably say, just by looking at it's overall design and functionality, it's definitely made in the States. And I love it!<br />I installed this on my 2014 Subaru Forester 2.0XT Touring without any problems. Very simple and easy to follow instructions as always.<br />Although a few notes were a little vague as usual. &#34;Headlight Overide&#34;, what's that? But didn't matter because the wire wasn't used.<br />As this was installed on a import vehicle, the install was extremely easy for me. Only used 6 wires of the dozen available.<br />I did purchase this thinking it was for the headlights and parking lights. As mentioned, the instructions are sometimes confusing with Whelen.<br />There is a set of wires that specifically say &#34;for parking lights&#34;, but not sure what there function was because they would not work the way I expected.<br />But in attached to the headlights and parking lights, making it a 360 flasher and probably voiding Whelen's warranty.<br />Had to do some custom splicing, install 2 diodes and download Subaru's technical manual, but in the end, it was worth it, fun and learned allot about my vehicle.<br /><br />Update 10.01.2015.<br />Retracted original comment. 4 to 5 stars. Discovered how to activate high beams while using this module as a flasher.
B002LEK706|5|Very nice,large cover. Bright paint, looks good but I ordered the wrong team and sent it back
B00L8HPL2G|1|dont fit my car
B00D8BFJP4|5|Just like it looks
B004H78NQ0|5|Look good and work as promised.
B001C9RNAI|1|This certainly is not an easy repair, the tolerances and access are tight. After a lengthy struggle I removed the old pump and installed the new one. Then I attached the low pressure line and found the hole/threads were stripped out. It certainly put a damper on the project when the end was so close. Now I have to decide if I should go through the hassle of removing and installing a replacement. Not to mention the delay. They need better quality control.
B002NEYIP4|5|fits... works
B00WIYY37M|5|Got these for the 2015 Duc Scrambler. Lovely addition. It's got Scrambler on the back of the foot peg. Gives a firmer foothold. Love it.
B001EOV3TI|5|I painted it before installation to make it last longer. Cheap and effective.
B00N65CS8I|5|goodEbayer
B001G4TV6S|3|returned.  did not fit jayco hitch.  still left a decent review as it appears like a good lock if it fit.
B000BRJVCA|5|These lights worked just fine in my camper.
B0018F3EG8|5|this is actually a nice bag.  works out great on the bike. I put my keys and other things I don't want floating aroumd in my pockets.
B000CB3ZY0|5|arrived on schedule, worked fine
B00432S99U|5|Surprisingly warm LED light and not too harsh.  Works well so far.  Bought another two after I found the first ones worked well and did such a good job of lighting the trees in the backyard.
B00G0LRSR6|5|OEM product,  easy to install, works great
B00GBQ3YXM|5|We used this product on our motorhome to pull the trailer and it helped so much. Great product and easy to install.
B00OPMIR2M|5|Works well. Easy to use. I ordered three of them and they are all still working well after almost one year.
B007V3ZSOW|5|excelente
B00VH643H2|5|These towels are amazing! I use them for cleaning my car, polishing furniture with oil, cleaning up spills, like soda...which is exactly what encountered today, and I was amazed to see how absorbent they are. I even keep one in the bathroom, I would totally recommend anyone to have these because they come in very handy. I received a this product for a discount or for free and that has no bearing on my rating or review of the product - this product has earned the rating I have given it. My opinion is honest and unbiased.
B00918IYMS|5|Easy to install and they look great.
B000E0E6TW|4|This is so much better than the ones that you purchase by sedan size. It isn't an exact fit (slightly larger), however it sits flat against the windshield versus the accordion style of the sun shade shields sold prior to this invention.
B00HQYTUYA|5|WORKS WELL TO KEEP BELTS OFF NECK
B00IMPEWHM|4|Just like OEM.
B006XKKG32|5|LIKE IT
B00C9CCQ1I|5|the valve do the job perfectly.
B0051ZHC3C|5|This is my favorite oil for the money. Use it in all my vehicles and is doing a great job. Thank you for a great product at a great price.
B00QMKYYYK|4|Decent quality fuses, and a great price.  I got this big set for less than a 25 piece set in our local auto parts store.  I ordered a set of both the large and small blade style fuses, and they both seem to be of average to above average quality, at a bargain-basement price. Adds up to a good value, if you tend to go through a lot of fuses.
B000EQ3EDA|5|Perfect fit.
B000VL9WTS|5|fits my 08 4 door perfectly. Not sure how to get it in the included bag but it does fold up well.I have been rained on with top and doors off and stayed dry. it looked like a small pool after one heavy storm but I just lifted the side flap and pushed up from inside to empty it.<br />It also works great for keeping the stray cats out which was my primary reason for purchase.
B00MLO3S52|4|Fits well. If you breathe hard you can feel a small amount of air blow up towards your eyes. Good fit.
B000N2XOHQ|5|Was having issues with my '67 Mustang not starting, after replacing nurmeous parts I turned to my point eleminator. I had bought an Accel one 3 years ago, and it had fried out. I bought this one for the super easy install process. Just hook up two wires and then set gap with the tool they give you. Super simple, would definitely recommend to others.
B005SEJTYG|5|Best motor oil money can buy in my opinion.......never use anything else.
B001HXZT14|4|Well made.  Good fabric. Has withstanded being blown around on motorcycle. Fabric has held up
B00BPIRGTO|5|great stuff
B00GTIBMVS|1|Kept setting off check engine light.  Faulty.
B0000AY4YX|4|OK
B003K3GMNI|5|Nice decal - Sticks well
B007MUY5PM|5|excellent product.  perfect OEM replacement on Leer XL shell.  Easy installation
B000EVWDAK|5|Scanner does what it's supposed to. The cable that is suggested with it is not needed.
B0088BX0IM|4|Kinda cheap plastic housing, but it get's the job done without connection issues. Not something I want to keep on the bike when I'm not touring though.
B000C9TPUK|3|I'll see how long it lasts. But it's the right one
B00NLP6QJU|4|This rack is what I was looking for in price and function . It works great for hauling my canoe and lumber. I gave it a 4 star because it could have opinion like mounts for light bar or mirrors for doorless days. If you would like to see my unboxing and installation check out my video on my Youtube page https://youtu.be/zRLdZ66h6Tg
B000GZL3W8|5|Worked perfect for crf100
B0079PXYKW|5|Very nice sticker. In a day and time when any bit of faith is lacking in modern day America, this says it all & then some. I love the second looks I get & it keeps tailgaters at bay.
B000B68V6I|5|Without this in your stored gas over winter, the ethanol will ruin new yard equipment.  The gas will degrade and require disposal.<br /><br />A good investment.
B000K1LDEG|1|KTI represents this in their Amazon online product description as a 19mm, but it actually is a 13/16&#34; wrench. Be aware that if you think you are ordering a 19mm, you are actually ordering a 13/16&#34;.
B00YQJVYPG|5|Good product will use buyer again
B000J15THO|5|saved 600.00 verses rebuild. no rear end noise
B00NEL6HUE|5|K&N products are awesome
B00NLR3F0Q|3|I got the XL but it fits smaller than most other SL helmets out there.
B00KCP16DI|5|Works as it should.
B007OWP4MQ|1|Absolutely terrible. I'm a professional installer and this is undoubtedly the most poorly put together kit I've ever seen. First and foremost it's falsely advertised... Yes this kit is &#34;capable&#34; of running a four door system... However the choice of brain units is where the fault lies. Only two channels are a positive signal. The others are a negative, meaning that you have to run a constant hot to the rear doors and trunk if applicable. As well as requiring an extra hot lead per each front channel rather than managing to have an internal source from the common lead. Putting extra labor on the installer and requiring more extensive wiring when compared to leading competitors. I'd be willing to accept this extra headache if there were a notable price difference, however the expense is nearly the same. That being said I'd highly recommend everyone, beginner and pro alike, steer clear of this unit and don't look back.
B002OUMU66|5|Was exactly what I wanted
B0002JN2EU|4|I don't know if it works or not.  I use it and everything is running well so I assume it works.
B00080QHMM|5|I currently own the older model which I have had for years and it still works fine, I just figured maybe I should replace the battery as the poor thing has been in my car trunk for years and endured blazing hot summers and freezing weather and still works like a charm. Then I found out you don't have to replace the battery and the new model has new display that's even easier to read then my old one which I could read fine even without my reading glasses. I can't even remember when I got the old model but I've replaced the tires twice since getting it. Looking forward to the new model, I'm sure I'll be just as pleased as I am with the original gauge.
B000BQYH6Q|1|Waste of money if you ask me. They're made of plastic so they slide on the concrete not really braking anything.
B006LGKI1I|3|Doesn't fit any size cup.
B00SS3337S|4|This helmet with the goggles and breath guard is a nice combo I ordered the large and it fits well. The goggles fit nicely with the helmet and will keep your face warm. The helmet does seem very light weight so it would make for a comfortable ride although that might be one draw back for durability. Also it does come with a chin guard underneath which slides in and out easily and that could mean falling out easily when riding.
B000GBIQB8|5|Great product
B00BITJHR4|5|Amazon saved my life with this exterior door handle I love y'all!!! I works like a charm.
B000BNXRVK|5|I did not want to buy it but CA requires a front plate.  This was less expensive than a ticket.  I was concerned about the look of the plate taking away from the look of the Westin bull bar.  It is actually not that bad at all.  The bull bar frames the plate nicely.  The plate ends up slightly recessed from the very front so that the plate does not stick out further than the bull bar.  It looks good.
B002MQ2T8G|3|i rate these boots with an extra star because they are affordable. nontheless their quality is basic, near cheap. In my case, the inner layer above the sole, craked? maybe due to dry and wet rides.I used dr scholl's insoles  and restore the comfort. I wuould gladlly receive this item as a gift, but i doubt i will purchase it again.
B00J3NPOM4|5|Love it! It looks great!
B005CHFD62|5|Just as described!
B000BPD95C|5|Just as expected, when I put new bulbs in my side marker lights they suddenly came on!  These things must be magic!
B005B4NCUK|5|gave as gift
B004ZF4MW8|1|Great when they're new! Now they are dim and they shut off intermittently while driving!
B00BFDJLN8|5|These will cost you from $25.00 and up at your local Honda Stealer so buy them here on Amazon and save yourself some money, Being a long time Honda owner I can say only one thing,  and that is the 95% of the after market wiper blades sold at Auto parts stores and Walmart are a poor substitute for Honda's OEM wiper blades which are designed to perfectly fit the contour of our Honda vehicles curved windshields,  Almost all the after market wiper blade replacements I have purchased over the years have leave at least a 5&#34; area on the passenger side untouched because they were not designed to follow the curve of the Accords window  (PS)  I forgot to mention that these Honda windshield wipers are designed to accept less expensive Honda refills.
B00QXDCDNK|1|Installed, hit the starter button one time, disassembled and found piston was broke into pieces.
B00OA7Q3AA|5|The lens fit perfect for most lights on  older RVs
B003SOKEXI|5|easy to install and inexpensive
B000C9Z21Q|1|Excellent brake pads I have used powerstop pads on other vehicles and they always fit great add extra stopping power and no noise whatsoever.UPDATE 12-17-15 AWFUL BRAKE PADS TONS OF DUST AND VERY NOISY RECOMMEND GOING WITH THEIR HIGHER END PADS THEY WORK AWESOME
B00GUSSDSM|5|Fit and work great for 2003 BMW X5 3.0i.
B00522RL44|5|Fits just right
B007S0GQ3A|5|Very nice. I've had mine for 2 years now and it's still in nice condition
B0067EZIE6|3|I have a Suzuki Boulevard m50.  Less that 65 miles per hour the windshield worked as described.  Often riding at 75-80 mph (as our car pool lanes run at) I was worried of its flimsiness as it is attached in only two points.  At its price point it was a great product to eventually gauge what I really wanted and on a small bike it would be a decent choice.  Ultimately It was replaced by a Suzuki alternative.
B000BQQMQ4|5|Needed durable mats and that's what these are
B0058ED3GG|5|shipped promptly. Tip is fine and maybe is as fine as they come but I expected or hoped it to be  just a little bit thinner.
B00IMEVECE|5|Delivery was normal took about a week to get here. Install was super easy...easier then I thought. Went to local auto stores and they were asking anywhere from 300 to 400 bucks. I bought mine here for 165. It also came with a 1/2 bolt for the steering wheel which is always a plus. My airbag light went away so another plus. I would recommend this for anyone who needs it.
B0002ZQB1U|5|Great glaze!!
B00EQMPANA|5|First of all, super cheap compared to what it would cost to buy brakes per axle separately, and of course, much cheaper than a shop doing it.  Easy  to install.  Plenty of YouTube material on how to replace brakes on a 2010 Subaru Forester.  :Perfect fit.
B0059JUC9G|5|exactly as described - perfect for comfort on any ride
B00GYTEBPQ|4|Fit as expected and made cabin smell a little bit better
B0001CMUV4|5|The StowAway Hitch Tightener did not leave marks or damage my receiver like the kind that drive a bolt to the underside. I used it to stabilize a motorcycle carrier with a 400 lb bike attached. It worked flawlessly. Simple design, yet very effective. I hauled my bike on the carrier for 1400 miles  and even over some dirt roads with this hitch tightener and it performed perfectly.
B009G1VKQW|5|It's SNOOPY!!!  LOVE IT!!!
B00NVFD3JG|5|It works fine!
B000LQJ7T8|5|all good and as advertised
B0002Q81W6|5|works good and looks good too
B00QGO1VDY|1|The 9005 bulb replacement was oversized and didn't fit right. They were. 015 too big. They said 9005 just like the one that came out. I made them work by opening up the socket hole some.  Not oem parts.
B004VG8DS0|3|3M makes good products but EXTREMELY difficult to install.
B003CSN2HA|5|Easy to install works great
B00PF6LAF8|5|Easy installation and works just fine.
B0006IX87S|2|does not fit.
B000CIIYIK|5|Worked perfectly and still working
B00BMRRXSM|5|Great for use in the yard when playing outdoor games and also would be great and easy for camping.
B00GWTX35W|2|Looks sick but cheap material was already cracked
B00JOEH3KS|5|Replaced the old ones perfectly. I used them to hold bar end sliders on my 05 gsxr 600.
B00J5SP6VG|4|THey worked fine. Put them on as your instructions. Very simple to install and are serving us well.
B004LX3AS6|1|Never worked for me - forgot to return the defective unit.  Out $27.  Shame on them and me.
B00GSNAS1Y|4|No clip included only lights not exact as image shows
B00JJR55W8|5|I've had it on my computer for a year and its still wonderful
B00AKEVXI4|4|fits and works well... plastic drain piece is not as good as others....others screw on which make it easier to use
B00LNQBQLW|1|Did not &#34;plug and play&#34; even with load resistors. The bulbs would turn on for a few seconds and then flash repeatedly.
B001PN88NC|5|There is some discussions about wether these are insulated and can be used on a running vehicle. I have not tried this because I do not have the need. But I can tell you that stamped in the medal on the ones I received it says to shut the engine off before using.
B005G6J3EM|5|Easy to apply
B001DDMB2I|4|Have yet to use the device but it appears OK
B000NS2FUW|5|just as expected
B005J6JRMM|5|I got it fast and top quality, however I should have measured my original because this one is too small
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Great looking decal and gift for the paddler in your life.
B00943V7S8|5|Looks awesome, easy to install and looks great recommend cheers
B006X6MT9U|5|It looks great on my Tahoe thanks!
B007CPLVNG|5|Excellent new condition and conform to the specifications Thanks
B000GU7JRQ|5|great service, as described , +++++++++
B00P73KWIU|5|Very sturdy rack. It was easy to install and it tightens down to a very solid feeling attachment. It comes with multiple attachment devices and appropriate instructions. I actually used two of the sets of bolts and plates because I need a very secure and stable rack (my Lab rides on it).
B008BLFHS0|5|Legit seller.  The item is durable and its too pretty for words.  Take your time installing and you won't regret it.  May smoke out my mirrors but we will see.  Thanks for the tube for good shipment.  I posted before and after.
B001PLM5TC|5|Good stuff !! Worked great !!!
B00OQWRTPM|5|Looks great not as hot as I thought it would be. I get nothing but compliments on how it looks.
B006H34BUY|5|I was surprised that it cleaned so well, and I like it very much.
B00WJBBEKS|5|no more excess mud inside my ace
B00CMP3Z1C|4|LOVE IT
B0014FM6YS|5|FIts my '04 Pacifica perfectly.  Hardest part of the install was getting the rubber stoppers off to drop the exhaust - watch a video on youtube before starting if you haven't done it before.
B0006O2S0U|1|It seemed accurate at first.  I used it to check the air in my Jeep tires before and after airing up or airing down to go off-roading.  This gauge worked good for awhile, then all of a sudden it started reading 20 psi, when I knew my tires were already set to 15 psi.  This was verified with two other gauges. It is lifetime warrantied, but now I have to hassle with shipping it back to the manufacture at my expense, plus a $2.50 postage and handling fee.  I'll probably just trash it and buy a higher quality gauge.  I'm disappointed that it didn't even last 90 days.
B00JH0T89I|5|beautiful
B0058EHH18|1|Too small...gave them make, model and year of car but they do not fit...
B00B8Z5BGE|4|Quality part fits well only issue is the hole for the top bolt on radiator support not there so I had to drill it out.
B000FGJR1W|2|I had this on my stock Harley 2004 Sportster XL1200R for almost 2 years. It seemed fine at first but after a few months I started to hear engine pinging when I accelerated. It got progressively worse to the point that it really concerned me this year. I received opinions ranging from plugs to &#34;this is normal&#34;. After a lot of searching I found someone in a forum who had a similar issue with this filter. He solved it by re jetting. I tried replacing the K&N with my original filter and the pinging disappeared. I have since put in a new HD stock replacement and my bike is back to normal, running smooth with no pinging.
B00LIAOTCQ|4|Nice
B001VXXUWK|5|Very good safety mask, protects entire face. Saved me from getting acid in my face
B00M9MHH08|5|Great grips,  I will buy again in a different color.  The knurling is good but not too aggressive for riding without gloves.  I like how they are thicker in the very middle and thin out to each end.  The pics don't do the actual contour justice.  These are very comfortable grips and fit my very large paws extremely well.  Very pleased with product and seller and would definitely recommend.
B00QDELX80|1|First order was defective and second order Stopped working after 3 months!
B00YQEZIWQ|5|Showed up quick and just like it was described
B00E7BF5SA|5|I was very satisfied!
B00WGZLWEA|4|I thought you would be able to just plug them in but they had it actually be wired in but they look great
B00A14QO5K|1|There are lots of reviews here confirming that this product does not fit the intended vehicles such 2008 avenger sxt but the seller just keeps wasting people's time.
B0062IJQEA|3|Well , if you're a perfectionist you will hate this item. I have a 2008 F250 and bought this item ignoring the reviews regarding how it does not mount flush. This is true ,the bracket that comes with this product must me altered (grinded down) for it to mount properly. I Did alter and it looks great! If you are a buyer that expects no problems or alterations this is not the product for you.
B00197S8ZM|1|I've never purchased this kit but you can purchase an authentic oem conversion with everything you need including headlights for 750-850 jdmenginedepot.com hmotorsonline.com floridajdm.com etc..... just to name a few sites Duraflex is never guaranteed good quality either i know from 1st hand experience and i also have owned 2 authentic jdm front converted integras.  Oem is the way to go and surprisingly cheaper then this kit
B0062IJOJ2|3|A little smaller than I thought they would be and they are difficult to install.
B0009TAOC6|4|Looks good, and easy install!
B00OSZ2N08|5|I love this trash can because it is easy to reach by the driver seat to throw trash away without your eyes leaving the road.  I drive a convertible and if there is any trash not thrown away immediately it flies out and becomes litter!
B000XTPO2M|5|Perfect item
B008E7TU34|4|they work
B00UBYNOOY|2|The elastics in the net breaks after using it a few times.
B00EFBFXUM|5|Works good !
B000P7O5DG|3|Doers what it is supposed to do,
B00GV8ABKY|5|An absolute must for any owner of a 1996-1999 Suburban/Yukon/Tahoe owner looking to service your transfer case!  The weak stock plug-type fasteners are weak and strip in the blink of an eye.  These are a much better, more stout design.  Buy 2!
B001FAIACY|5|This is the other review continuing from item  # 13215.53.<br />I got this item for the Jeep. The seat covers are really a good fit. The design of this item is really good. The cover fit around both the headrest on the rear seats. They have left those small elastic pockets so that the material does not tear while installing. They really look fantastic too once you install them. The item comes with the 2 sets of covers. The rear seat is basically divided into a larger & smaller seat part both of which can be bent  down with the clip to the side of the headrests. One set fits the large part of the rear set & the other set would fit the remaining of your rear seat. The item also includes the 2 covers for the headrests.<br />It is a little less pain in installing these as compared to item # 13215.53 for the Front seats. Bend the rear seats while installing the covers. It would help you. The covers also have these buckle clips which go under the seat & attach from the behind so that its a rigid fit. They also have these hooks that can clip to the metal part under your seat from the side below.
B000WG951W|5|As stated by multiple people, it's great for an emergency when you NEED to inflate your tire. I used it many times to inflate my tires to 30 psi. The gauge states that it's off by a few psi, so use a separate tire / pressure gauge. It's a little slow, but for this price this is a very good air compressor. I had mine for 4 years before the plastic on the plug got smashed (it's not super strong and a little brittle), but that's probably partially my fault for not putting it away every time.
B009DJPFF4|5|Item was packaged well and also made very well.  Clips were already on so no fuss there.  Less than a 5 minute job.  If you have a broken grill than look no further.
B007O5GX14|4|Had a problem with first one and seller replaced ,second one works as it should
B009YHTBBY|5|Outstanding graphics, sturdy construction - I'm proud to display it.  Thank you.  Bought a second one and it arrived almost overnight - great product, great service.   Thank you.
B000XVZ8F8|5|Works Great
B00BMPEN7S|2|I received the Disc Brake kit when promised.  I am giving it two stars now and promise to update when I talk to the Tow Zone tech people on Monday which brings me to my first point. Most people would probably start installing the brake system on a Saturday.  Tow Zone support is closed on the Weekend.  I read all the reviews for this product and find them all enthusiastic in recommending this product because how easy it is to install.  I am fairly handy and feel I can do most projects with some help from the instructions.  The instructions refer to six different systems  and I found my system by matching most of the product codes on the parts to the parts list that was supplied.  I did find some larger parts that were not on the parts list.  The biggest issue other than not being able to speak Tow Zone was that the brake mounting plates do not fit my trailer. I have a Load-Rite single axel (2&#34; square galvanized beam with the spindles welded on) which is fairly typical.  Also, with a little work, the directions could be a lot better.  My recommendation would be separate the individual models and provide individual instructions for replacing/refurbishing/installing new, from each other.  Maybe just putting the instructions on their web site would be helpful.  Hopefully tomorrow will bring an inexpensive fix to my problem; if not,  I guess I will have to read the return section.
B000WEIIZI|5|Good quality lighter outlet. Installed in my aircraft for USB power source and worked out very well. Good product for this type application.
B000CSWCAG|3|I did not notice any change in the stale cigarette smell after using this product.
B004JK861M|5|High quality and great look.
B000GOG3QA|5|Works great in my car.
B009OTR15U|5|Perfect color match.  Delivered on time.  I have not installed them yet, but, they look very good.
B005FYR3NI|2|Would not buy again.
B004940ZSK|5|Product installed easily and works perfectly.
B00B2PZO62|5|100% satisfecho
B00QL6HXJI|4|good enough.
B00IUQEO3U|5|Love it!!! Works and fits perfectly
B005G9Y11E|5|good
B001FAK28E|1|It did actually mention on the product discription, that the passenger side mirror would be obstructed, but in my personal situation it could barely be seen at all. It may be better than none at all, but not much better.
B00F0X3FWW|5|awesome fits perfect! Thick, not flimsy!
B00CDAFT6K|4|Good but I wish it covers the whole window.
B000KZ0AWS|1|don't buy this remote. it didn't work in my mazda mpv 2003. also it's cheaper in ebay
B002F4RE1W|5|Absolutely love these. Ordering two more as spares they look very sharp on my vehicle.
B00AZPI0NE|5|Lve it
B00G0P0GHQ|5|It is what it says it is. They only seem to last a year or two before cracking or splitting. Wish Toyota made them to last, or I could find a permanent alternative. Shipped in a timely manner.
B0001XPC7C|4|Nice little coin holder that holds $9.30 in quarters, dimes, & nickels. It comes with some Velcro tape for some limited attaching. The coins occasionally get hung up but this item works well in general.
B008BLFHS0|5|As expected
B000ONZP4O|5|Worked as described!
B0009IQZPW|4|OK
B000CB6D0S|5|Worked exactly as described.
B000C53RR6|3|Shocks came in a timely manner.<br /><br />Problem was that 3 of the rubber mount bushings were absent.
B000NTJ388|5|bought as a critical spare for my Ford 6.0. If you blow off your turbo compressor outlet too many times the internal bead gets damaged and it will not stay on.
B000OR18BE|5|This has been a life saver!  having to live in a 5th wheel with out sewer is not the best way to go if you need to get this dumped often, than this is the way to go and best buy..
B001GEO0ZA|4|Makes keys easy to remember
B000LWA3OA|5|Made installing studs a breeze. No more trying to find spacers that would dig into the hub.
B000CD5QB8|1|My husband says these parts are of very low quality. Easily bendable and not a OEM fit for a 2001 Nissan Altima GLE. I ordered two and one arrived with the top part of the casing missing for the bearing leaving the inside exposed.I will upload a picture of both parts showing that the bearing on the left has the missing casing.
B000CMKGD2|5|These are the best quality thread repair kits.
B002XLGR6K|4|Love this product so much I bought it twice! The included mounting hardware isn't very secure from disassembly so you'll need to visit the hardware store. Last one I bought rattled off while driving on forest roads so I highly recommend applying loctite when installing.
B00I9SK8WK|4|Plastic Dip was delivered quickly and did as advertised. Worked Great!
B00NHBYOA6|5|Took this to a 3 day concert and it worked great, threw a couple frozen bottles of water in to assist and kept all food and drinks cool.<br /><br />It fit perfectly in between the seats in my ram 1500 truck, it's like it was designed to be there.<br /><br />For those that don't read, it says 32 degrees below ambient temperature, not 32 degrees internal temperature so it won't ice up a brew, but it will help keep cold food cold.<br /><br />It also seconds as a food warmer if you are traveling with a warm dish to grandma's house for thanksgiving
B00YY7M4AO|1|Can't get to pair to my Samsung Galaxy s5 it keep saying can't Communicate it keep doing the same thing no contact on amazon my email address is miltonmoss13@gmail.com
B004IZKKZS|5|Good quality gasket and fit. So far no problems. Just remember this is good for one head. Need to order two if replacing both sides.
B0012TPVC0|5|Works great. Wish the straight brush bristles on the end were a little softer.
B00EVPM0LC|3|I like almost all of my OTC tools, but this does fall a little short. I bought it as body waw brass so I figured that this was a &#34;stronger&#34; pump. However this is really just the basic cheap plastic pump with the same cheap hose fittings.  This pump is only useful for pumping water and gas, not oil, or even ATF fluid.
B004HEBN1A|5|It functioned just as any respectable roof basket should, one issue was that the 4 joints in the middle were a little weak and bent a slight bit, but overall it served my purposes well
B00EFTDIHY|4|Good clear rear back view mirror very good night vision
B00X69TQES|4|Works great
B006P0WNMW|5|an EXCELLENT engine oil for the prices offered; as good as, or better, than the &#34;sale&#34; prices at the major brick & mortar retailers. One of the best values for a dexos approved oil that is available on amazon. Even though the picture doesnt show the logo, it is a dexos approved engine oil.
B00DI3DV6G|5|The organizer.is just what I wanted .I folds up so nice ,for storage. Works so well.
B00EUICSGW|5|Good example of you get what you pay for - the license plate frame we purchased wasn't the cheapest but when it arrived it was very good quality and looks like we will be using it for years to come.
B00YQ4FJM0|5|Nice cup.  Holds the heat and doesn't burn your hand like some cheaper cups.
B001GQ12PO|5|Love it and proud to have it on my vehicle. Good quality and great colors!!
B0012TT5BI|5|perfect fit,my bike fired right up!
B000C01UXE|5|fit 2005 Tuscon as advertised.  can't say how long they will last put the rotors are at least as good as those from the parts store at a considerable savings.
B00B4W8B8G|5|Worked out perfect ty
B0007Y7Q10|5|Used these to move a 48 inch 650pd range off a pick up truck and they were great!
B002UD0GGS|5|The polish is exactly what I wanted and will improve the surface appearance of most plastics which are not deeply scratched.
B0002UNON8|5|I wasn't expecting much from this product, but was pleasantly surprised. It obviously can't repair deep scratches that go to the base coat. It did however fill in &#34;deeper&#34; scratches I wasn't expecting it to. All it takes is to wipe the product over the scratches with a cotton cloth, and most of the scratches are gone.Happy with an overall solid product.
B001C5O9P4|5|Very comfortable, they do not fog up easily. The storage case is nice, and allows the extra lenses to be safely kept. I like the amber ones best. They're a little tricky to change, but once you get the hang of it, it's not bad. Only you do end up getting your fingerprints all over them because of the way you have to grasp the lens. Luckily, they include an optical cleaning cloth, because you will need it. ;)
B00B73RZUW|5|very nice product, i was a little shocked by the price but ones i got them i was thankful.
B00JBIAFJ8|5|Quick delivery.  Direct Bolt-in fit.  Nice look.  Huge difference in visibility at night.  Installed on my RV.
B00LBFPDT6|5|I got 10 for the price of 2 at the local auto part store, They all work great on my Ford v10
B00BCRMB34|3|It ripped easily
B004Z1J736|5|Excellent fit. Installed on my 2004 Ford F150.  I am enjoying the comfortable ride these struts have returned to my aging truck.
B00GSQ8MSC|5|Great value, didn't have to leave the house.
B008CF9P2Y|3|I would have given it a higher rating if it were not for a couple issues. First let me say, that for the most part the quality of the bumper and braces is very good. It was also nice that all the major components like step pads and all braces were supposed to be included. Unfortunately, that became an issue.  I wasn't home when the box was delivered. When I first saw the box, it looked like a truck had driven over it. I could also tell that at some point, both ends of the box had been taped. Probably after the truck ran over it. After opening it, I realized there were some problems. I found a couple nuts and broken plastic. On further exam, I saw that all the pins holding the right side step pad were broken off and both pins holding the step pads on the bottom edge of the bumper were broken. Surprisingly, the lower step pad was still intact. That explained all the plastic pieces, at least the ones that were still in the box. While I did find the bag with the new lights intact, there was another bag that was open and completely empty. Given that there was no documentation on the inside of the box, I don't know what might have been missing.  I was able to reuse my original step pads. I also had to use my original left side step pad because the bottom pin hole on the included step pad did not align with the bumper hole. Might explain why that one had broken.  Fortunately, I was able to reuse my original nuts and bolts and the install went together without any other problems for the most part.  However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed - the plastic opening that attaches to the bumper and the mechanism that lowers the spare tire. If these pieces were included with the bumper, it didn't arrive in the box. I was able to remove the original but it was a major pain. It took me as long to remove it from my original bumper as it took to remove the old bumper. You might be able to install it after the fact but I think most of us would like to do everything at once. It's also easier to install when you can flip the bumper around. So, that needs to be factored in before you install the bumper.  Originally, the price seemed fair and reasonable, given everything that was supposed to be included with the bumper. But now having to reuse a lot of my original parts, the price to value for this bumper was too expensive, for me.
B0036ULEV0|5|I've had more expensive air chucks, but this one is by far the best I've owned. The braided hose should mean it'll never leaked compared to the ones with rubber hoses that dry out over time. The clip however sometimes can be difficult to grab on certain vehicles. I used it on my 2013 Kia Optima Hybrid and it grabbed onto the tire pressure sensors perfectly. Older vehicles with traditional tire valve stems varied though.
B00JZRP6VC|5|It's  exactly three inches across.  Will not fit over a three inch exhaust pipe<br />Made  extremely  well but fits pipes smaller than three inches. I have a three inch exhaust pipe and I cut my finger wide open trying to put it on, it  took 6  stitches to close shut my finger<br />They took back the tip and refunded my money.<br />Good product but watch the size.<br />And it looks good too
B0009YDQC6|3|Bought these June 2013 they wore out with minimal use, falling apart and sliding toward the gas pedals, 2009 Camry!  may not be a ggod choice.
B00KTHXLIC|5|Key worked as advertised for 2001 Toyota 4Runner Limited. Had it cut by a hardware store, then followed the instructions on the website for programming the chip. Unlocks the doors and starts the car as advertised, and is a bargain compared to $70 at Home Depot or way more at the Toyota Dealership. Thanks.
B00KQIB4LU|5|Excellent item
B00SLIAE2M|5|This is an awesome reservoir. I have a 2000 chevy metro and after years of having the same reservoir,getting hot to cold and vice versa,tund to dust. I needed to replace it but could not find the exact one. After looking for several in this site I decided to give this one a chance. The original resevoir, being small and hiden in a tight area,was hard to look at a distance. This resevoir,with minor modifications,is place in a better position and have had no problems
B000CMDQDE|4|I bought it to complete a set.
B00CLW0A8W|4|Still flickers at time. Not as described!
B000GZBZOE|4|These go on very easy and fit well except the drivers and front passenger ones have a problem with the small tab that sticks out to start the installation. I had read in another review that this could be an issue and I have it with mine. I can't put the windows up with out manually pushing the shade out to keep the window from destroying it. I plan on either trying additional 2 sided tape or trimming the piece off altogether. Either way I would have rated these higher if not for this issue.
B001DKQL6I|5|Awesome.Came with all the right parts an was easy to install a perfect fit. this was the first time i changed a water pump.
B004GC97IO|1|DID NOT FIT. NOT EVEN CLOSE
B004EIAADG|5|Works great in a power failure situation.  Laptop wasn't all that happy with it  (the cord ran hot) but then this isn't a pure sine wave inverter.  It both ran and charged my laptop for about 3 hours before the power came back on. ***Almost 2 years later****  I'd give this 6 stars if I could.  Have had to use it for power failures and jumping off one car.  It has stayed in the car for almost 6 months and tonight I brought it in to recharge it...it only lost 2% in those months of cold.  I've had others that barely had any charge left in a month.  Only draw back is it is now $26 more than when I bought it 2 years ago.
B007X6O0P0|4|Worked out great for the price.
B00355JQ52|5|For an all in one product this  takes the cake hands down! The cleaning / polishing  can be enhanced when buffing with a whool pad.  I put the first coat on with the wool pad and the second coat I apply with a microfiber pad.  When you have an all in one product,  it will never be as good as separate products.  For most people (myself included)  only wax seasonal equipment at the start and at the end of the season so an all in one product is ideal.  You cozy go wrong with this one.
B00YMU47K8|5|bought these to replace the straps for the bimini on my play bouy sport fisher pontoon boat.  work perfectly, good quality and very reasonably priced.
B004DRYQ3I|5|Perfect fit. Had to adjust aim because they are set to the lowest but that's easy to do. Really improved the car.
B000GU0RGG|5|Ty
B00XUVHTAA|5|Good
B000C5FLXY|5|Fast shipping worked great!!!
B00KV0EBEU|3|Item was as described just shipping was really slow
B00NTQWSZ2|4|Arrived fast, needed it to fix my brake handle. If I bust another, I'll be back for more.
B00BVPTNBK|5|Excellent product
B00WH1ZC80|5|Simple and works
B001G359U6|5|Perfect match. Just had to change a/c maintenance valve.
B0006GF5SK|5|My RV always had a nasty odor rising from the bathroom.  I used room fresheners, scented wax warmers, potpourri, anything to make it smell at least decent.  We used a liquid type tank cleaner/deodorizer.  This product worked wonders!  No nasty smells!  I will use this product and no others from here on out!
B0091AHD96|5|Just what I was looking for.
B000I861V6|5|bolt on ,
B00852684M|2|Got these in good time, but they don't work very well.  I had to replace the batteries which cost more than the lights and they still didn't  stay lit while moving. They were flashing sporadically and I was riding my bike at a steady speed on paved roads. I do not recommend these and am looking at another product.
B00QLTT8X4|5|Great springs combined with KYB struts installed in my 1997 Miata the car looks awesome sport and low the ride is firm but comfortable and with the lower center of gravity is a much better car for driving fast in curvy roads now is almost like kart !
B000BXKZUQ|5|Good size can, strong blast of fluid. I've used one can for about 6-10 brake replacements.
B0012GTVVA|5|A+
B000OAG63G|5|Shower head works beautiful. Just like a home shower. The hose is a little stiff though
B00JVWDWPS|3|Flapping noise & discomfort of taking off & on the freedom top front two panels . But have not found anything better than this in the market .
B00KQ3WSXI|5|FABULOUS! These ramps are godsends, my brother is in a wheelchair and we live in a split foyer house, six steps up and six down. We put these ramps over the steps and push him up or down. We are definitely not ADA compliant in our use, but it beats hanging out in the garage in minus 30 degrees during the winter.
B00B6X7PGM|5|Put it on an edger and primed it a few times.  Started on the first pull
B000CSSR96|1|I bought this cover on April 27, 2015, as of the end of July, this cover has completely disintegrated. As someone else stated earlier, you are better off buying a car cove from Walmart. At least you can get 7 or 8 months of the cheapy Walmart cover!
B0058DPO7S|5|Just what the doctor ordered!
B00E6ABLZI|5|Fantastic.
B008VWAEKU|5|Arrived promptly and was the product discribed
B00LUZB9LI|1|Omg, you would think for $13 you would get a good ashtray. This supposedly new one came without one of the screws that's holds the light and battery in place. On top of the cup it had an inch wide chip. It was delivered half way put together. Save your cash and look elsewhere.
B007SR4A7C|1|Worthless. Consistency of jello and does not stay on the RTV so it has no chance of working.
B00JW1WQSC|5|exactly as described and works great
B00VMMALKY|5|It arrived quickly and I am super pleased with the quality!
B00B5KYRG2|5|I have a 99 Ford Explorer. Center console upholstery ripped due to wear. I ordered the replacement (medium graphite) from Zealous Interiors. Arrived on time. Replacement was easy. Just need a Philips screwdriver, staple remover (or pliers) and staple gun (6mm staples). My center console looks new again!
B001U6DMSK|5|Pleased with this product.
B002PQOC5Q|4|Good quality happy with the purchase
B0009IBJBM|5|I used the Jump Start feature on my specially designed 6-12 volt battery and and worked out starting the car with one dead cell in one<br />half on the battery. I do wish the manual had a few more illustrations to tell how to read the meter- something that I learned by the<br />guess-by-trial-and-error method.
B000IG5PZQ|4|Works well, wish it was back lit for night time use
B00CRR5L8U|5|Work perfectly
B00TPM7UTI|5|Nice starter for my boat. Things corroide pretty fast in Baja Mexico
B0002SR8AK|5|Used this on my 09' Ranger as there is no other way to adjust the headlamps. I tried others means that didn't work but finally gave in and bought it. Works great.
B00IAB4728|4|Smaller than I was expecting, but I didn't pay attention to the size I was buying. Nice subtle HP display on my car.
B0006IX85K|1|Hose didn't last a week and the end came off.
B00MJKWBXI|4|No instructions in box makes it a little challenging to install.
B00OHZLQR0|5|Matched the paint exactly.
B000XY6Z66|5|Both my wife and I purchased one for our ride to Sturgis and they worked well. I would recommend these for the value.
B00BF3DNKU|5|Who Dat!
B00IZR6ETQ|1|DO NOT BUY THESE WAY OVER PRICED JUNK PLUGS I HAD 1 FAIL WITHIN 32 DAYS AND ANOTHER FAIL JUST THE OTHER DAY 12/22/2015
B000XY51FW|2|Had to buy new screws, the ones that came with it had too long of threads would not hold tight without stripping but the rest worked great.
B000E19EH0|5|Worked perfectly!!
B000EPWQEY|4|Good fit but the appearance varies from the illustration. And while that may seem to be of little consequence, I was attempting to mirror the design of the original from my '65 Buick. The illustration is exactly what I was looking for. The supplied part differs. But, hey! Great service and fair pricing!
B0041CDPQO|5|worked fine
B00FFDPPCA|5|Item arrived promptly and installion went well.
B007ZG8JXW|3|3 of the hoses included in the kit don't fit the 1.8t Jetta, and there are hoses that this kit didn't have at all. I didn't really have a choice but to install these, had to replace a couple of hoses. Awesome quality, just would have been nice to be able to use the entire kit..
B00AGLO9FU|1|Nismo Decal took 7 weeks to receive and I only got 1 not 6 like stated. Against my better judgement after reading reviews I still orderd, don't make my mistake ! Do not order
B00UX5S9W8|1|Color doesn't match,its much darker
B00ZCE2Z5W|1|5 star's zeros to the left short circuit hazard in the plug cord good lights but s*** power cord not worth it. Junk.....
B005DV9HVY|4|Not quite identical to the photos in the listing, but very close. LEDs are bright enough, but not great. Wires are a good length and product functioned upon arrival.
B00LY8V4DO|5|Perfect replacement and way cheaper than every other place I found.
B00NT4P284|5|EXCELLENT!!! THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY
B00GUTBHRU|4|Works great. Used old clip on back, but not front--shock post width not allow. Not a problem since front hole fit was very tight.
B003PIYUCI|1|Hmmm, all the other reviews are good so not sure what is my issue.  I installed this after verifying on the CURT site that it is for my car.  It did fit correctly and I did have to trim some of the bumper fascia.  However after just a week of hauling my 2 bicycles on a thule carrier, the entire hitch seems to no longer be in the same position.  I suspect when I remove things I am going to find the whole bumper beam bent or the hitch damaged.  From below the car, I can clearly see the entire thing has moved.  Unfortunately, now the carrier rides so low to the ground as to be almost unusable.
B0076AU20U|5|1 minute is all it took to install!  Maybe even less than that and the static is gone!  Just received and opened the box less than 10 minutes ago.  This was awesome. Great repair for less than $20!
B001CDB242|5|They were just as expected. My girlfriend loves them!
B0116GZP1A|4|In case you missed it like I did, This is basically a female cigarette lighter type plug and comes with one of those USB male cigarette lighter plugs. If  you want an dedicated USB  plug, this might not be for you, but if you want the option to run anything with a &#60; ~2.1 amp draw from the plug and have an option USB insert, than grab this item.<br />I'd say its MOSTLY waterproof out the box. There are some weak spots (mainly the electrical connectors) that could be fixed with some electrical tape. The biggest issue is the rubber plug to seal the outlet only works if you have USB insert in the plug. If you never use that insert and leave the outlet open then I seriously recommend using a switch to power the plug only when needed to prevent shock or short. If it were not for this, I'd give it 5/5
B00C80HM9C|3|The product is simple to install and easy to use, you may want to consider buying another light to go with it because it is pretty small, I like the product but the only thing it didn't include is the owners manual
B0074FQKDA|4|Exactly the same as the ballast that burned out. I hope it last more than 2 years like the old one.
B002BG4WX2|5|I had an air conditioner leak and after 3 days everything would leak out. They told me it would be about $1000 to fix it but I bought this red angel put it right in there very easy and I'll tell you if it works. I got cold air again and they save me about a thousand dollars
B000WJF4HS|5|fits perfect on my 2010 raider
B0002J6K1C|5|looks great!
B005J1UK2I|5|we plan on buying two more
B004J2FD1G|5|fits like oem part in a mazda 6 04. it came with everything I needed. So far no problems with the new mount.
B00LMZK24G|5|Product is as advertised
B00HYMFCUU|5|just what I needed
B00K24EA3M|5|Very good quality , worked great .
B00DBESPEK|5|It works well.
B006JJWNZ6|5|Outstanding light! Streetglow is one of the most reputable brand in the led/neon market, without a doubt. This light does nothing but agree with that statement.
B006VN3GHY|5|It's an easy install.  I used to install hitches and wiring in my youth so my comfort level doing this is really high.  The only tool needed is a small flat head screw driver.  There are videos on Youtube on how to DiY this kit.  In addition you need both the relay and wiring harness for the trailer to have all its functionality.
B00AWN2X8M|5|My seat covers are perfect! love them. Great quality and beautiful tiger print! Definitely recommend!
B005VNNVQ6|5|Awesome item! Protect your Odyssey from the parking lot idiots!  Looks great, easy to install, comes with installation template.  Make sure to download the install instructions from the website listed in the package contents.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B008VPY5Q6|2|Mine only last about a year with my over the knuckle wj, you might as well order 2 or 3 cause no other brand makes them
B00NSUMRUU|5|I love the size of this baby on board sign! As weird as it is, when I'm driving, & I see somebody who has a baby on board sign, I immediately will be more cautious. I'm not a crazy driver, I just know that there is a baby in the vehicle that needs to be protected.<br /><br />If somebody has a baby on board magnet or sticker, and they put their blinker on, I have no problem with letting them get in front of me. If somebody is slightly speeding because they have a baby on board, my first initial thought is I really hope that they get to where they're going so let me get out of the way, because what if it super important. I know I had one when my baby was super tiny, and we were always rushing to get over to the doctor because he had really bad asthma. So I know the importance of something as a baby on board sign. It might not be a big deal to other people, but to me I always just become more cautious.<br /><br />I would love for every parent who just had a baby to have one of these. Because new parents will drive 15 miles under the speed limit in order to be extra safe. :-) we've all done it.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.
B000CIPHUI|5|Works great! I'll buy another on.
B00CYW0BJ2|4|You get what you pay for, but it is a good product.  It is attached by double sided tape which requires a clean, oil-free surface.  Use rubbing alcohol to clean the surface before application. There are some gaps in the tape which I filled with clear silicon before applying. It works well and looks good.
B00XKFRHBC|5|Excellent fit, sounds great both in listening to calls and music and when I have made phone calls those on the other end indicate they can hardly tell and that the sound is very crisp and clear on their end. I am still getting used to all the button combos to control this unit but feel I will be very pleased once I am comfortable with all functions.
B003BNNH4O|3|This mounting bracket has the bar across the top and mine didn't.  the result was that it does not completely allow the clip to move completely out of the way, and my 2006 Elite 9000 awning foot would not slide into the slot on the bracket without grinding the bar away some.  I thought originally it was probably an improvement to the design, and never tried it onto the foot.  it looked close enough, but wasn't.  So be careful of which Elite 9000 awning you get a bracket for.  No others were shown here for any different options for an Elite 9000, and obviously Dometic is making slightly thinner foot bars to fit into the brackets.  If you don't mind fixing it yourself, order this.  otherwise, get it from a dealer and let them do all the fitting and grinding to make it fit like the original.  Just be aware you're going to have to spend up to an hour (depending on skills and tools) grinding it down before you mount it.
B0007VBUBK|4|Love this tow hitch
B00JR33MYW|3|It is ok but it is a little wobble not very secure.  Another thing that was not good was it did not come with the screws and we had to try all kind of sizes till we got the right ones.
B00S77QVY2|1|Low quality muslin ... Not heavy canvas need to return
B00018ZWFO|4|It works fine but the truck doesn't go very fast
B0006IX7Y2|5|I had seen a variety of hose supports-but this type is the easiest to use thanks
B00INAVNTQ|5|Perfect kit for doing a service on your quad everything you need .
B004QBWT9E|4|fits  just like the dealer part it replaced.
B00RBML7RK|5|Works as expected
B009CMNAJK|5|Great water bottle with a straw to to the bottom so no need to lift up to drink just open and suck
B000E35WEC|1|I replaced this in less time than it takes to get the door panel off.  It was an easy replacement and fit perfectly.  The wiring in the box was perfect.  I docked it one star because it does not come with new screws and the screw holes aren't tapped.  I just ran the screws from my van into the holes anyway.  One of the holes started to spin out however.  In my mind this really is a problem.  I removed the part and epoxied the now-tapped nut back into the plastic.  Other than that, I'm thrilled with it's performance.  ***UPDATE*** 9-6-15 All three mounting nuts have pulled out of the housing  It's only been a month.  I'm very disappointed.  I've had to take the door apart again and now that I've thrown away the old motor I don't have any way to support the window.  Grrrr!
B004A6M5LW|5|Great
B0049OL6OW|5|Fit and fixed the problem on my 2004 Chevy Avalanche. Saved a ton of money doing it myself! Took about an hour. Thanks!
B005DC5KJQ|5|Granddaughter put this license plate on the same day I gave it to her.  Very Happy!
B00IZCNK4I|5|Fit perfectly
B000UH4Z8G|5|went in... seems to work fine..  difficult to tell if it is doing anything.  I use it when I change antifreeze and don't often do water pumps so must do something.
B00B2ATTUE|5|I have a wide axle 2015 Jayco Whitehawk and these were the perfect solution to stabilize the trailer. Very easy to use and they make the trailer rock solid. Be sure to follow the instructions and level the trailer first, then install these.
B000JZWRJS|5|verry good
B009FQU0MI|5|First of all, this is a direct fit cat for a 2003 Honda Element, it may also work for other years.<br /><br />Second of all, it did NOT bring all the required gaskets and hardware. You are going to need one pre-cat donut gasket, and one post-cat donut gasket. Second of all, the stock tail end screws WILL NOT WORK. You WILL get an exhaust leak if you use the stock screws. Luckily I was able to use a mixture of new hardware and some fabrication to make a viable solution for myself, but really. How much more would the hardware have cost?<br /><br />Unbolting the old cat took the greater part of half an hour, using some SeaFoam &#34;deep creep&#34; to work the rusty stock bolts off without too much hassle.<br /><br />Installing the new one took me three hours, due to the aforementioned lack of hardware. I mean, really?<br /><br />Anyway, I already have an injen catback exhaust, and it makes an awesome, and mean (yet understated) hum. Adding this cat has really given the car a broader deeper exhaust note that doesn't get old.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Sure! But I mean really, throw the gaskets in there too!
B005NLQAHS|5|Works as it should. Hooked it up to the tablet and it just does what I need it to.
B001B4UW2K|4|Works pretty well for what I purchased it for. The main reason I purchased this set was to be able to keep my wife's car windows cracked a little bit while her car is parked outside all day at work during the hot summer months to receive some fresh air and cool down the inside.  They are made well, received mine with a few scratches on them from rubbing during shipping but nothing terribly noticeable. The adhesive really seems to hold nicely (it's only been a few weeks since installation however) and they were easy to install, especially after watching a demonstration video online. A couple negatives I have are first they don't cover as much of the window as I had hoped, thus not allowing the window to be cracked more than a half inch at the most if storms with any kind of winds are expected during the day, at least I would hate to chance it and she hasn't tried to leave them open during any storms yet.  You can probably get away with an inch if rain chances are low for the day without much worry. The other issue I have is that the instructions say you can only wash your car with touchless car washes and I have always been a big fan of the drive thru brush style car washes as they perform better. Overall, we are pleased with the product and she is able to keep her interior cooler when her car is parked outside.
B00HSHW2FY|5|100% 👍.. Thank you
B001EIXQGM|2|These are not for 5/16 fuel line. No details in product listing (like size range), just the listing saying these are for 5/16 fuel line.They are way too small. Wasted my money.
B00029X2N6|5|I ordered this for my Dad, and he was happy with it.
B002P776XK|1|One of my hubcaps popped off while I was driving.  Now I only have 3 left :(
B00ISAA6KS|5|These are bulky, but packging was incredible and went on easy.  They look nice.  Glad I got them.
B000BUQOEU|5|Hey must have for all manual operating awning owners.
B0071N6UGC|5|Just replaced my plain plastic factory door sill with these beautiful carbon fiber door sill plates.  Looks so awesome!
B001T9AREK|5|great tool, it is a high quality tool and works as advertised.<br />it also allows you to save lots of money by buying the oil in liquid state, and some oils like ester or mineral are very hard to find in a pressurized can, they are easy to find in liquid state.<br />also some oil are sold in liquid state with dye the dye will help detect leaks.<br />hint, it is easier to use this tool with the compressor running since there will be less pressure to insert the oil.<br />This tools is amazing, the quality is very good and there are no leaks when using it.
B003VJVQGY|4|Looks great on my F250. The front doesn't look so plain. Slightly easy installation the mounts are kind of weak and cruddy I might have to figure something out myself
B00QMZE4RW|5|Super fast shipping, easy to install(5 min total) and gives off a bright white light. Looks great!
B001C6OZ6Q|5|Original &#34;roller&#34; on both front windows for 1990 chev lumina shattered -- likely due to age of plastic part.  This Dorman part snapped on easily (used channel lock pliers) and worked well.  A bit of time to take all of door panel apart to get to the broken OEM part.  Will see if the Dorman replacement also wears out after another 25 years.  :)
B002UC2UB8|5|Used full time for 40ft 5th wheel.  Easy to read and use.  Has held up for 6 months.  Best price I could find was from amazon.  Everyone with an RV should have one.  Cheap insurance...
B001AXGT7O|2|It works but it big and bulky. Too many parts put together bad design.
B005S4F9MW|5|Works like a charm. I have extremely thin wrists and I almost always have to make my own holes in new watch straps in order to get a snug fit. I used to use an awl which made for ugly results. This device leaves clean circular holes.
B008QPTV2E|5|Looks great on my van easy to apply
B0087ZPATG|5|Excellent product !!
B000BYEMJK|1|Does not fit a 97 civic
B0027AGFDW|2|WARNING!<br /><br />Amazon does not always give accurate information for compatibility.<br /><br />I personally searched for a bearing assembly on a 06 Honda CR-V (rear wheel).<br />Amazon brought me to this product and I purchased it. After receiving  the part and spending a few hours taking my vehicle apart. I learned that this part does not in fact fit my vehicle like it was suppose to.<br /><br />The return and refund process went smoothly.
B00HQ2MCCO|1|The clasp broke.  Leather strap came out of the metal sheath.
B000WY8RVS|5|Very good sandpaper. Long lasting.
B004Z9OJOA|5|Could not be happier. Really easy to put on as long as you can tell right from left.  The Chrome is the added luster that brings out my 2002 limited.
B00KQX5D3K|4|Thank you, I did receive my order on time and in good working order.
B00B5PIDCG|3|I should give this 4 stars, it's very well made, installation was simple enough, however it did not fit a standard cab. I made it work though, the cable was to long, Amazon said it would fit, I believe it's for an extended cab Toyota.
B00BVQGFZG|5|Works great, I had no probs at all!
B00MYF7ZZC|5|I am impressed with my car trash can! It is actually larger than I expected, which is very good, and it stays where it is placed. It arrived quickly and well packaged. Thank you so much.
B000UV8FNS|5|Work great for me!
B00KAEU78Q|1|Do not waste your time!
B00PYW5V08|5|Beyond ecstatic about this product!!
B00AZ2IBWC|4|Worked very good.  Just wish there was a better way to attach the power cable to the bracket.
B002YKI7KO|5|After fussing with the timing belt on a Zetec engine, I bought this and it made the job much easier.  The pin wouldn't fit in with the exhaust in the way, but gently bending the heat shield a bit allowed for it to slip into place without removing the entire exhaust.  The pin fits great and was a must have for the job.
B0000AZ9KS|4|when you extend it across your truck bed, you can't reach the ratchet handle, so that kind of sucks.  Otherwise strong and works as it should
B007SW2O2U|4|Comfy, easy to install, mine did not tear, cheap. HOWEVER: they are NOT gloss black as pictured, mine arrived a dull powdery charcoal color. Beware.
B00FY7M38Q|5|This is absolutely adorable in my daughters car! Fits great! Looks great! Made well! So yeh, she's styling!!!!
B00LEBLI82|5|The packaging was a little sparse, but the items arrived undamaged.  I am satisfied with the brightness.  I am really pleased at the current consumption compared to the incandescent bulbs I had installed previously in my RV.
B00BI29ZM8|5|I have used Wizard products for a long time. This is great as a carpet cleaner for your auto or home carpets. Works better at removing summer bugs on front of your car than Wizard's Bug Release product.
B002PUM6MS|5|Perfect Fit for my Penguin on the 92 Airstream!
B003H6SPZG|1|Not for a 2001 Ford F-250
B003JHEP66|3|The mats are mud brown,  not tan as advertised. Would have appreciated a more accurate product description since I bought them based on color (weather tech mats are  obviously, grwaft)
B000C9IVHS|1|The part fit as advertised like original.
B005796WYC|5|Perfect replacement for original, works great at a great price.
B0031BOV6E|5|Put these on a 84 Nighthawk and I love them.
B00VB2OJLW|1|It fits bit i should have gotten a tougher one thicker
B003E1O9ZE|5|Great for the rv
B002969BQW|5|Good stuff, but don't use it on fresh paint/primer unless you want to remove it.
B003AOPCA6|5|Excellent fit for my '95 YJ with OEM style soft top.  So far it has had skins from Rugged Ridge and Smittybilt stretched over them - did fine.
B002ZS4QCS|5|Neat product. Hangs easily on back of seat
B00AKAVPBS|5|Fits great when you take off your rear seat on a Ski Doo Grand Touring.
B000NZWSG6|4|Fit well and good quality. There are no installation instructions so you need to fiddle with it because the lamp locations are not the same as the original.
B00EPREXYS|5|Work well fixed skip
B0082ACC6U|3|Wonderful idea in theory...Cover is not bad overall.  The folding idea is very convenient and eliminates the hassle of trying to stretch and close a standard tonneau in cold weather.  Super easy to install.<br /><br />Only two things really fall short for me on this cover:<br /><br />1: The latches at the rear of the cover are not a set and forget kind of thing like the video suggests.  If i adjust them to hold the cover down enough keep it from sliding around, then when I fold it up, I have to loosen them up quite a bit to lock into their storage positions.  Consequently, then when I close the cover again, I have to go through the latch adjustment process all over again.<br /><br />2: And really, this should probably be number one...because the position of all four latches is relatively far away from the corners of the cover, the corners stick up about 1/4&#34; and do not seal to the bed rail.  This obviously lets rain and road spray into the bed even with the cover close.  I have tightened the clamps as much as I can by hand (these are hand turn claims) without resorting to pliers for extra leverage but the corners still don't seal.  Items in the bed won't get soaked like they would if there was no cover at all, but there is enough seepage that anything laying flat on the bed floor will get quite wet from the water getting inside and running to the floor  This may be a deal breaker for me and consequently will be sending the cover back for a traditional roll up cover.
B0007ZFTHW|5|Works Great
B00EYZUNJ0|4|Works well but is awkward to use needing reflective tape to be applied.
B007PP02GU|5|Worked great for my Shelves!!
B001RLX8PA|5|In both my vehicles!
B00IKQRCUC|5|Works perfectly. Need some insulation however due to close proximity to exhaust.
B002XJGP46|5|great fit , fast shipping, low price, !
B000GV7286|5|First class product; easy installation
B000BNH0I6|5|Good the I wanted save a lot of money loud
B0087JQWWQ|1|i installed this into my 2000 mustang v6 alongside a sequential kit, and this screwed up the already perfect sequence. Random lights flashed in the left taillight, and when i went to pull it out i burned my hand because it was so hot. Very dissapointed will be returning
B00HBJM8LW|5|great light.Thanks
B009RZR7Z0|1|Just goit it but it just stays on dont change colors or turn off i think the black box doesn't work i tried to contact the seller but i couldn't to see if i could get another box but they look realy cool if i get the other box i will change my review to 5 stars
B0016VGUGU|5|Fits Toyota Tundra 2015 like a glove. Nothing slides. I tested it with two kids back there all greased up and they stuck like velcro midgets. I recommend!
B00T5CPBMQ|5|Love the lights just need someone to install them for me
B000CMJI7M|5|I bought it to complete a set and it has worked out well for auto and gate work.
B000GQA8DC|5|This thing is AMAZING! it fits perfectly in my car and i got it mainly for the cup holders because i didnt have any before and they work great they hold your cup or bottle or can in place perfectly with the adjustable size. And the storage compartment it huge it is very deep so you can fit a boat load of stuff in there.
B00DCULNXS|5|Great - thanks..
B000GV75F6|5|Looks and works great
B00G4RUPT4|5|Great - thanks..
B012J99VGS|5|Some of the best and most prompt service I have received. Everything went great & would recommend them to others!
B0006Z9SSY|5|Works Great Good Price.... Needs To Ship Faster...
B008032ST0|5|they work just fine
B000CNJ4A2|5|Stopped my oil leak! Very solid product!
B000COBXPA|5|These are heavy duty and great for pulling anything.  Better and safer than a chain or cable.
B005IZDASQ|4|Fast delivery.front struts nut was on the wrong side on one.2 month so good so far.
B001UCEUQ2|5|Nice,nice,nice brake pads for the money. Thank you warehouse deals.
B000XEGEWG|3|I recently got these Microfiber cloths. They are good. Amazon listing said 12 Cloths but there were only 10. Hence, I gave a 3 star.
B00R7ORS34|5|Good buy.  Will make the job easier and quicker.
B00RW7WW50|5|Worked beautifully on my 2004 Audi A6, until it was totaled.
B00HW79EBA|5|Goes on ez looks nice
B00M5GJUQM|1|Fit well without any problems. Shipping was fast.
B00C5RBRA8|3|Very nice but does not fit in my 4&#34; bumper hence the lower rating
