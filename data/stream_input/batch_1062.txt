1439107955|5.0|**I am pleased that Dr. Mukherjee has won the Pulitzer prize in general non fiction for this book, 4-18-11<br /><br />In the United States one in three women and one in two men will develop cancer in their lifetime. Dr Siddhartha Mukherjee, a medical oncologist, has written a definitive history of cancer. It may be one of the best medical books I have read. Complex but simple in terms of understanding. A timeline of a disease and those who waged the wars. In 1600 BC the first case of probable breast cancer was documented. In the thousands of years since, the Greek word, 'onkos', meaning mass or burden, has become the disease of our time. Cancer. The title of the book, is \\"a quote from a 19Th century physician\\" Dr Mukherjee had found inscribed in a library book that \\"cancer is the emperor of all maladies, the king of our terrors\\".<br /><br />As a health care professional and as a woman who is six years post breast cancer, Cancer has played a big part in my life.  I used to walk by the Oncology clinic, and quicken my pace. I used to give chemotherapy to my patients, before it was discovered that the chemo was so toxic that it needed to be made under sterile conditions and given by professionals who specialized in Oncology.  Dr Mukherjee, wisely discusses cancer in the context of patients, those of us who suffer. After all it is because of the patients, the people who have gone before us, who have contracted some form of cancer, they are the base of this science.<br /><br />Dr Mukherjee started his immersion in cancer medicine at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. He relates the beginning of the study of ALL, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, by Dr Sidney Farber in 1947. Dr Farber, a pathologist at the time decided to change his focus and start caring for patients. He was given a medication to trial for ALL, and though most of his patients died, some survived to remission. This opened his world and with the help of Mary Lasker, and Charles E Dana, philanthropists, they opened one of the first clinics that specialized in cancer care and research, The Dana Farber Cancer Center. Dr Mukherjee gives us the timeline of ALL and lymphomas and the medications that turned into chemotherapy. The development of  specific care for blood cancers and the emergence of AIDS and patient activism. He discusses the surgery for breast cancer. It was thought that the more radical the surgery the better the outcomes. We now know that lumpectomies have an excellent outcome. But, women before me had a radical removal of breast, chest tissue,  lymph nodes and sometimes ribs. The lesson learned is that breast cancer is very curable now and all those men and women, the patients who suffered, gave us the answers and cancer care has moved on.<br /><br />The onslaught of chemotherapies changed the face of cancer, and the 1970's served us well. In 1986 the first outcomes of cancer care were measured. Tobacco emerged as an addiction and soon lung cancer was a leading cause of death. Presidential Commissions ensued, politics entered the world of cancer, the war against cancer and the war against smoking. The Pap smear was developed, and prevention came to the fore. The two sides of cancer, the researchers and the physicians at the bedside, who often thought never the twain shall meet, recognized the importance of research to bedside.<br /><br />The story of the boy 'Jimmy' from New Sweden, Maine, became the face of childhood cancer. The Jimmy Fund, a Boston Red Sox charity in Boston, is still going strong today. 'Jimmy' opened the door to the public for the need for money and research, and care for those with cancer. We follow Dr Mukherjee with one of his first patients, Carla, from her diagnosis through her treatment. He has given a face to cancer. We all know someone with cancer, those who survived and those who did not. Cancer prevention is now the wave of the future.<br /><br />\\"Cancer is and may always be part of the burden we carry with us,\\" says Dr Mukherjee. He has now written a \\"biography of cancer\\" for us, those without special medical knowledge. However, he does go astray in some discussions such as genetics. I have an excellent medical background, and found I was floundering at times. As I discovered,and Dr. Mukherjee agrees, our patients are our heroes. They/we withstand the horrors of cancer, and the horrific, sometimes deadly treatments. The stories of his patients make us weep, and the complex decision making about their care make him the most caring of physicians.<br /><br />The 'quest for the cure' is the basis of all science and research, and Dr Mukherjee has written a superb tome in language that we can all attempt to understand. The biography of Cancer. Cancer may always be with us,Dr Mukherjee hopes that we outwit this devil and survive.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 11-13-10<br /><br />[[ASIN:0738510459 Jimmy Fund of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,  The  (MA)  (Images of America)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0807856827 Early Detection: Women, Cancer, and Awareness Campaigns in the Twentieth-Century United States]]r\\" for us, those without special medical knowledge.

I love all of her music but I think this CD is the best yet. The songs on this CD seem more realistic in many ways and more grounded. This is an awesome CD:)

B003VS0CXS|5.0|Little prepares you for the print on this - it's simply extraordinary.<br /><br />It's been frame-by-frame restored using the Lowry Digital Restoration Process which was used on all 20 of the Bond films, the three Godfather movies, the original Star Wars Trilogy, the Indiana Jones films and even the transfer of Avatar (all to much acclaim).<br /><br />But this 2010 Blu Ray/DVD Combination pack reissue of 1968's \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" has to be a benchmark - even for them.<br /><br />After the excellent 2DVD set issued a few years back, I didn't think that much more improvement could be wrenched out of the negative, but it has been. This transfer is practically faultless - BEAUTIFUL to look at for the whole duration of the movie. Directed with style and flair by Ken Hughes and filmed in 70mm Super Panavision Technicolor - it's a sumptuous feast of colours - you see their period clothes anew, the details in the inventions inside Caractacus Pott's hillside home, the uncluttered English countryside, the Scrumptious Sweet Factory, the seaside scenes, the two bumbling spies, the toy dance at the King's Birthday Party in the Palace where their love shines out and almost gets them caught - all of it - gorgeous to look at. There's old and 'New Extras' also...<br /><br />Sally Ann Howes looks suitably wholesome and lovely, Dick Van Dyke is as likeable as ever (a much underrated leading man) and the songs are excellent if not a little twee in places. The quirks of Sixties movies remain intact too - the patience-sapping Overture at the beginning where a black screen sits there with only the roaring of car engines before the picture finally appears - the \\"Intermission\\" break in the middle (so you could go and buy sweets) where Chitty goes over the cliff-edge and you don't find out what happens until the film starts up again and you're back in your seats - all there - as it was in the cinema - and the original aspect retained too.<br /><br />The child-catcher is still the scariest monster ever created in cinema (with Benny Hill being strangely creepy too) and the interplay between Gert Frobe and Anna Quayle as the bickering King and Queen of Vulgaria is still pricelessly funny. All this and Stanley Unwin speaking \\"...horribold...\\" English to Lionel Jeffries - which always makes me pine for The Small Faces 1967 album masterpiece 'Ogden's Nutgone Flake' (he spoke in between tracks on Side 2).<br /><br />Sure it'll be too saccharine for our \\"Call Of Duty\\" teenagers to enjoy nowadays, but there's something timeless and lovely about this 'magical car' movie - and that beautifully evocative \\"Hushabye Mountain\\" melody always renders me a quivering mush whenever I hear it.<br /><br />This 2010 BLU RAY of \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" is a superlative reissue of a family classic. Ian Fleming would indeed be shaken - and possibly even stirred.<br /><br />Recommended like a duet with the wife on \\"Chu-Chi Face\\".<br /><br />PS: for other superb restorations on BLU RAY, see also my reviews for \\"The Italian Job\\", \\"Saturday Night, Sunday Morning\\", \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\", \\"Goldfinger\\", \\"North By Northwest\\", \\"Cool Hand Luke\\", \\"The Dambusters\\", \\"The Prisoner - The Complete (TV) Series In High Definition\\", \\"Braveheart\\", \\"Snatch\\", \\"The Ladykillers\\" and \\"The African Queen\\"with Benny Hill being strangely creepy too) and the interplay between Gert Frobe and Anna Quayle as the bickering King and Queen of Vulgaria is still pricelessly funny.

0061989142|4.0|I impulsively purchased this book when browsing at Boarders one night. After skimming through several pages I quickly realized that it was a book that I had to buy and I did! This book is perfect for someone who is looking to redo or create a new wardrobe and cannot decide what key pieces are needed/how to make them work. Although Lauren does offer a lot of tips that many fashionistas already know, I guarantee readers will learn at least a handful of new things too. I'm not the biggest LC fan (not for any particular reason), but I have always loved her style. She always dresses classy, which is something that a lot of young women in this day and age do not do. Although I am 23 I feel that this book could easily work for someone between the ages of 14 and 30. The book also covers Lauren's signature make up looks and hairstyles. I'm really happy with my purchase!
B00065MDS6|2.0|I'm amazed to see all the four- and five-star reviews. Crimso made some exquisite records - In the Court, In the Wake, Larks Tongues, Starless, Red. This is not one of them. Even Islands, another awful platter, has its memorable moments. This record is virtually devoid of them. It is the sound of a band - or a semblance thereof - flailing to under the weight of its myriad aspirations and inspirations.     The arrangements are self-consciously cluttered and relentlessly disjointed. The electronic keyboard sounds (mellotron excepted) are right out of a Sears catalog. Gordon Haskell's brittle, mannered vocalizing insults the listener's rightful expectations of talent and ability. Fripp's guitar playing is, as always, brilliant, flitting through the proceedings like a steely butterfly - but it amounts to little in the absence of solid songwriting. All told, this record bristles proudly with a flaw of which so many classic prog bands are wrongfully accused: gargantuan self-indulgence.    Fans like to blast KC's sophomore effort In the Wake of Poseidon as a pale carbon copy of the band's debut. This record is equally derivative; it just doesn't sound nearly as good. \\"Cirkus\\" reprises the ominous mellotronics of \\"In the Court.\\" \\"Indoor Games\\" is another radically ornamented blues in the mold of \\"Schizoid Man\\" without the passion and virtuosity. \\"Happy Family\\" is \\"Catfood\\" drained of humor and finesse. \\"Lady of the Dancing Water\\" is \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" augmented by a leaden brass band. Lizard's pronounced jazz filigree lends a dash of spice, but the primary ingredients are stale.    If Lizard has a virtue, it is the record's uncompromising weirdness, and listeners who prize an album for its stark individuality will find this an outstanding effort. Many more, however, will find it a pointless cacophony. It is, perhaps, telling that Fripp hereafter abandoned his initial, florid Crimsonic concept, never to attempt anything like it again.

089898890X|5.0|I purchase a lot of instructional books on drumming.  When I bought this book I put it away and forgot about it.<br /><br />A few months later I learned of a weekly jazz workshop in town where they have jam sessions.  On the night I went, I ended up playing for a hour and a half with jazz musicians that I have never met.  I did ok, but I obviously needed to hit my drum cave and practice more jazz.  That's when I first started to look at this book.<br /><br />The section on \\"comping\\" is great and the rest of the book provides training that's very helpful to any drummer that wants to play jazz.  There's even a section on brushes and the CD rounds out the package.<br /><br />The ability to read music and understand drum notation would be helpful in working through this book.<br /><br />There is no question that this book has influenced by ability to play jazz and provided lessons that I can apply at those weekly jam sessions.<br /><br />Learning to play jazz well is a lifetime endeavor but having good books that provide relevant training along the way is critical.  This is a good book.
1400097029|1.0|My book group selected this and, while we haven't yet discussed it, I did talk to two of our group and we found this book a very painful read.  I have to admit that I stopped half way through when I talked to another reader who told me it never gets better.  I really expected to like it.  I was immediately grateful to have the Kindle edition because I had to look up words in the dictionary about every other page!  How annoying.  There wasn't one likeable person in the story, so I couldn't get emotionally connected to any of them.  Then when I found out about the tragedy I realized the book was not going to have any redeeming qualities.  I quit 1/2 way through.
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|For me, the movie easily held my attention through, a docudrama that is based in reality but perhaps acceptably dramatized for movie sake. For those interested in a journey through the life of someone with a mental condition, and efforts to cope, this movie is probably for you. If such concepts are not something you have the slightest interest in, there will be better movies for you. I was wondering how anyone could rate this 1 or 2, but after reading such posts I could also see from their perspective while clearly having a different perspective. I liked the movie a lot, and have watched it on a couple of occasions.<br /><br />It would have been better if there was more information presented, medically or biologically regarding Nash's Schizophrenia, or simply Schizophrenia in general. I think that viewers enjoying such movies would have appreciated this, but this was certainly thought of from the production team and I respect the movie for what it is. A beautiful movie.

This is a doc,  and most of the songs featured on the DVD are supported by graphic \\"eye-candy\\" and are quite dull.

B004132HZS|5.0|Clever turns, witty dialogue - loved it. I am a big fan of all things Holmes but I don't like change. It took me a while to get used to Brett's over the top portrayal after Rathbone's rather crisp Holmes, but he was so droll and on point how could you not love it! I sat down prepared to completely hate this new take but after an hour - hooked all over again! Cumberbatch's face when he has an ephipany is priceless. His chemistry with Martin Freeman is solid and believable and this show would be worthless without it. Finally a Dr. Watson I can enjoy. The others were dreary.<br /><br />I think that the Holmes from the original stories *is* a diva, *is* rather a spoiled brat, but someone who operates on a far different level the most folks so it's merely very exasperating. He needs a sane and wry Dr Watson to keep him tethered to the real world, grounded in whatever century that world and its sun happen to turn in.<br /><br />I loved the first episode, Study in Pink, but not the Blind Banker. I watched it several times but there were many \\"and ok yeah but what was that supposed to mean\\" on my side of the screen. And it's not an Brit/American translation problem, it's a plot thing. Doubtless more erudite people then myself will state it more clearly.<br /><br />The last episode, The Great Game made up for it all. And how. The last 15 minutes had me literally yelling NO WAY! Moriarty saying \\"I will burn the heart out of you\\" was just so perfectly evil. He's wonderfully nasty in this series. I can't get enough Mycroft either, isn't he perfect? Too much fun indeed. It's been a long time since anything on TV has involved me that much.<br /><br />I do love how they throw many bits of the stories in where you don't expect it, like \\"Rache\\" and the Vermeer painting, really added to the fun for me.<br /><br />You know, sure, it's got holes and flaws (and the best Dr. Watson and Mycroft EVER) but you know what? When you watch anything like this, you have to suspend disbelief for a bit and just have fun. I surely did and I can't ask more then that.<br /><br />Addendum: I just received the DVD and had a Festival of Sherlock. Watched it all from end to end :). The pilot included is a great take on Study in Pink but the 90 minute version is far superior. Still, it's lots of fun. I just love that cabbie! I am assuming I have the full BBC version and not the PBS edits but I am not 100% sure. There's some included material on the Blind Banker especially that I wish hadn't been edited out. \\"The making of\\" episodes were enjoyable.<br /><br />I am really glad I bought this DVD!

0393072231|4.0|The global financial crisis  of 2008, which has already cost American taxpayers billions of dollars in government bailouts, was not caused recession but actually by greedy people relying on manipulated mathematical models intentionally made so confusing that most financial experts did not really understand them. In \\"The Big Short\\" Lewis simply lays out how Wall Street firms were turning sub-prime mortgages or loans made to people with virtually no creditworthiness and little documentation into exotic, poisonous financial products. He shows how these wall street firms then made a fortune laundering and reselling these toxic instruments by scamming the very ratings agencies that were supposed to police risk.<br /><br />Lewis does a masterful job of introducing the reader to the world of the bond market while at same time drawing equally lively portrayals of the quirky and sometimes strange characters in his story.<br /><br />Using these individuals subjects' Lewis gets across his story of greed and hypocrisy of a system gone awry lacking supervision and filled with wall street institutions that attempt to refute the need for government regulation in high times but plead for a rescue by government in bad times.<br /><br />In the end we find the citizens of the USA holding the bag with trillions in bailout dollars and everyone in the book goes free standing ready to pick the pockets of Americans once again on the next \\"Big\\" wall street product.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|Most of the negative reviews on here are not for the movie but for the way the DVD/Blu-ray's are being released.  I, for one, am more than happy with the way the re-releases are being handled.  The original Blu-ray came out extremely quickly after the theatrical release.  In order to do that, it was not 3D and it had no extras. But whether you think that is the reason or it was to make more money is immaterial. The fact of the matter is that the studio was very transparent about how they would have multiple releases of this.  No one was forced to buy the first one just as no one is being forced to buy this one.  They are simply giving the consumer more options while also maximizing their profit.  It is a win-win.  IF the studio were to do one grand release, it would be almost a year after the theatrical release and they would have to charge more for it.  Then, people who don't want extra features would not have the option of a lower priced product. They would either have to pay the high price or not get the movie at all.  What's more, Amazon is selling this for the same price as the original no frills!  So what are people complaining about?  Too many options? Some people just want something to b*tch about.  If you don't want it, don't buy it!  It's that simple!<br /><br />As for the movie...there are lots of reviews out there.  I will just say I was pleasantly surprised.  Some of the more jaded and cynical will tell you the plot wasn't original enough. What they fail to understand is that most great movies meant to appeal to a wide audience deal with universal themes and so does Avatar.  It is the presentation of it that makes it unique.  If you want nuance, then go watch an indie film and discuss it over a latte with your pretentious art-house friends. If you want a great story that's beautifully shot, then watch Avatar.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Much has been said about how mesmerising District 9 is, that it is worthy of 10/10 stars & is a movie that comes once in about 50 years. I watched it, bought it, and I concurred with every positive review it generated. That said, I must admit that the movie could have been more exquisite if the storyline was not rushed and had more character development.    For starters, I am a bit discontent that Vanessa Haywood (who brilliantly portrays the character of sole protagonist's wife, Tania van der Merwe), only appears in the commencement and the conclusion of the movie. Vanessa is a brilliant actress & I await with bated breadth to see her next movie, The Sweet Shop, in as much as Bridge Of Names, which features David James (Koobus Venter) in the lead role. So it would have been more electrifying to have Vanessa's character developed in a form of her, let's say, defying MNU instructions & going out to look for her husband, Wikus, relentlessly endeavouring to discover the truth pertaining the sexual intercourse scandal with aliens (rumours propagated by her father), and even involved in some fighting hypothetically speaking.    They could have also mommentarily deccelerated the pace of the action in order to give more analytical detail to the storyline (the illegal genetic research programme performed on Wikus to be precise)), as was the case with the Incredible Hulk, when Thunderbolt Ross explained to Emil Blonsky the serum that was developed & what culminated to Bruce Banner evolving into the Incredible Hulk & Banner & Betty Ross sharing a private conversation in Betty's house. So character development of chief nemesis Koobus Venter (David James), corrupt MNU CEO Dirk Michaels (William Allen Young), Nicolas van der Merwe (Johan van Schoor), MNU heads & the likes would have at least complemented this classic flick.    Maybe they were hell bent on completing this movie within the running time of 108 minutes. The fact that it was nominated for four Oscar Awards but barelytook home one didn't surprise me. These Oscars & Academy \\"trophies\\" are American based & will always favour their own talent. Besides which, District 9 does not need these meritorious awards to validated how incredulously great it is. But despite these minor flaws, District 9 in my perspective, is the best science fiction movie ever made, because the great things that transpire in it largely outweigh any minor flaws I have highlighted, thanks to Neill Blomkamp & Terri Tatchel for an unprecedented storyline.
B003YY8KF6|5.0|Received the new Norah Jones CD  from One2One Network.I was excited when I received my new Norah Jones CD to review because I am such a big fan! I popped it right in my computer  and listened while I read my emails.  I think she has an incredible and unique sound. Typically,  I'd have to say I'm a rock kind of girl. I do enjoy Norah Jones, though .Her new album is called \\"Featuring\\" and was recorded from 2001 to 2010, into one amazing collection: legends like Ray Charles, Willie Nelson and Herbie Hancock, rock artists ranging from Foo Fighters to Ryan Adams to Belle and Sebastian, hip hop luminaries OutKast, Q-Tip and Talib Kweli.The album begins with Love Me, a duet Jones sings with The Little Willies and wraps up with Blue Bayou (yes, Blue Bayou).  Norah Jones fans won't be disappointed.There is a song for everybody actually for jazz,  hip-hop or   country fans!My favorites songs are \\"Here We Go Again \\"(Ray Charles featuring Norah Jones ) and Baby It's Cold Outside (Willie Nelson feat. Norah Jones).
1416955070|3.0|This review was written for my blog, so the hyperlinks and strikethrough text got erased when I posted it here, but I think you get the gist.  ---  I'm finally getting around to reading Cassandra Clare's City of Bones (first book in the \\"Mortal Instruments\\" series) and I have so many conflicted feelings about it, I'm actually having a hard time just reading it.  Nevertheless, this post is actually a review of City of Bones.  IT HAS SOME SPOILERS.  Not that there's much to spoil.  First of all, I've been familiar with Cassandra Clare's work for quite a few years now...of course, what I mean is that like thousands of other people, I knew her from her LOTR and Harry Potter fanfiction days, under the penname \\"Cassandra Claire.\\"  She would probably be the most stellar example of what's known as a BNF, or a Big Name Fan.  She wrote the \\"Very Secret Dairies\\" for LOTR and the \\"Draco Trilogy\\" (Draco Dormiens, Sinister, and Veritas) for Harry Potter.  They've been translated into various languages and most likely if you read any Harry Potter fanfiction at all, you've probably heard of Cassandra Clare.  Unsurprisingly, there was also some controversy and accusations of plagiarism involved, since she paraphrased or \\"forgot to cite\\" a lot of phrases and quotes that she used in her stories, which she'd taken from other famous works/fandoms.  You can read all about it at her very own Fanlore page <here>.  As I recall, she may or may not have been gifted a laptop by fans when hers was stolen - though this is apparently one of the myths that got deleted off websites like Fanlore.  Anyway, all this is just background context, but it's important context, and you'll see why.  So basically after this highly successful fanfiction stint, Cassandra Claire became Cassandra Clare, the best-selling author of the YA \\"Mortal Instruments\\" series, which finally brings me back to City of Bones.  With that said, City of Bones is more or less the Harry Potter world reimagined, and what I mean by that is that basically almost every single concept and phrase and description in this book seemed oddly familiar...  But that's kind of to be expected, since naturally a writer's style can't change overnight.  Still.   Here's now the series works.  Clary Fray is your normal teenage girl - for about fifty pages, anyway - and basically she starts seeing things that other people can't see.  No, it actually isn't a book based off the ever popular faerie mythology.  Clary sees three teenagers covered with weird markings kill someone they claim is a demon.  Turns out, there's a whole \\"Shadow world\\" out there, where there are vampires, werewolves, faeries, and so on.  One of those marked teenagers turns out to be a young Shadowhunter named Jace, who happens to have all the same mannerisms and characteristics as Draco Malfoy, especially the Draco Malfoy portrayed the Draco Trilogy.  In other words, he's arrogant, wealthy, sarcastic, blond, and he even comes with a back story with some kind of stern father who teaches him that \\"to love is to destroy.\\"  The father spoiled his son with luxuries (they live in the Malfoy - well, a manor - after all) but the father also died.  Jace is a Shadowhunter, meaning he's been trained since birth to kill demons and whatnot.  A Shadowhunter uses a stele (which is a wand-like object, Clare's description, not mine) to draw runes, i.e. they use this \\"tool\\" to do magic.  Cool, right?  Okay, Jace is actually pretty appealing (well, why not?  He's basically Draco) but the similarities don't stop there.  See, about 16 years ago in this magical world, this guy named Lord Voldemort - er, I mean Valentine - decided to get rid of everyone who he felt wasn't pureblooded enough, which in this case means anything nonhuman.  There's actually quite a bit of snobbishness going on between the Shadowhunters and the Muggles - er, I mean mundanes - that don't know about this magical world that's hiding in plain sight.  Anyway, 16 years ago, \\"Valentine\\" failed andeveryone thought he and his wife and child died.  His supporters, the Circle (okay, fail, Death Eaters sounds so much cooler), either died during the Uprising or turned themselves in and are somewhat co-opted back into the government, but exiled.  Clary, of course, turns out to be mysteriously connected to He Who Shall Not Be Named, who turns out not to be dead.  Like you didn't see that one coming.  Anyway, Valentine sends demons after Clary and manages to kidnap Clary's mom.  Clary's dad conveniently died around the time she was born.  Hmmmm.  Valentine used to be this popular and handsome Shadowhunter who, you know, didn't start out evil but gradually became obsessed with killing all the Downworlders (those nonhuman, part demon whatevers) and using this thing called the Mortal Cup to create more Shadowhunters from regular humans.  Problem is, only like 20% of the converted humans survive, but Valentine's not going to let that stop him.  He builds up his followers - the Circle - which basically consists of the parents of all of Clary's new Shadowhunter friends.  By the way, the Shadowhunter names are all things like Blackwell, Pangborn, Lightwood, Fairchild.  Just so you know.  No sense of deja vu, of course.   Also, in a twist you so couldn't see coming, Valentine turns out to be Clary's mom's husband, which makes Clary...right, his daughter.  Oh no!  To help you (and Clary) keep track of everyone, there's this old picture of the Circle when they were young, y'know that group of friends who were all together...too bad the picture isn't animated, right?  Let's keep going though.  So V's after the Mortal Cup, which Clary's mom has hidden, so Clary and Jace try to find it while some action and unrequited love pads the story.  The relationships are painfully similar to what was in Draco Trilogy, but I guess you can't really plagiarize from yourself.  On the romantic front, I won't spoil it completely, but just think Leia and Luke Skywalker.  Uh huh, another classic.Jace also has an \\"I am your father\\" moment.  All right, all this said, despite all of the above, City of Bones is a pretty good book, in the same way that I thought that the Draco Trilogy was pretty fun to read.  Incidentally, the Draco Trilogy can be downloaded as a PDF from a variety of places.  Both the Trilogy and this \\"Mortal Instruments\\" series have lots of Latin inscriptions, lots of references, and lots of funny moments.  It's only irritating because the whole thing constantly makes me think \\"wow, I've seen this before,\\" to the point that it was really distracting.  There wasn't a single part that I felt was all that new, but everything was pretty well done and well written.  Clary is almost unbearably a Mary Sue, but I was way more distracted by the shoutouts to Jaida Jones (another famous fanfic writer turned published author, who actually did write a novel I liked, Havemercy) and Holly Black.  Regarding the Mary Sue issue, though, can we please get rid of all these fantasy heroines who never seem to realize they're beautiful until their romantic interest tells them?  Cliche much and annoying much?  Please, you're telling me a 16 year old girl somehow never realized her own level of attractiveness.  Really, now.  Unsurprisingly, the \\"Mortal Instruments\\" series has been a big hit and might be being made into a film.  Lots of people are saying it's the next Harry Potter.  In my opinion, it's more like a Harry Potter rehash, but given how much HP has sold, if Cassandra Clare can take even 5% of the market share, that would be a pretty big success.  Would I recommend it to others?  Hmmm.  I think as an avid reader of YA novels, I have far better series to recommend to my friends.  You could definitely do worse, but you could also definitely do better.  For those who like fantasy and heroic fairy tales, try Kristin Cashore - though her books are very well rounded and definitely deserve all the YA awards they've won, so try her even if you don't usually go forfantasy.  For those action-minded, try Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy or Ann Aguirre's Enclave.  If you're looking for a more grown up, but still teenage epic action/romance series with vampires, try Richelle Mead.  If you like stories about futuristic technological dystopias, try Scott Westerfeld or Robin Wasserman.  Leaning toward epic fantasy or consider yourself a fan of Tamora Pierce?  Try Allison Goodman's Eon.  Update: The \\"MI\\" series ARE being made into films and the hype is already that it'll be the \\"next big thing\\" when Twilight ends.  All I can say is, that's almost as predictable as the book.
0312427999|5.0|I mean no disrespect to Naomi Klein in calling Milton Friedman's \\"Free-Market Capitalism\\" the Schlock Economics Doctrine.  If Southside Chicago's Jean Shepard had thought about American economic policy, he would have called Uncle Milty's \\"free-market capitalism\\" the \\"Schlock Economic Doctrine.\\"  It fit so well with Jean Shepard's cogent observations of America's \\"Slob Art\\" and the American ignorant masses being force-fed \\"Hollywood Schlock.\\"  Jean Shepard was the classic under-achieving cat-caller from the peanut gallery, but he understood the seedy side of American culture.  Jean Shepard was the exact opposite of Milton Friedman.  Where Milton Friedman was an erudite, cultured, main-stream sell-out, Jean Shepard was a street-wise, slovenly, counter-culture true patriot.  You could always get the truth from Jean Shepard (along with a mouth full of four letter words).    Milton Friedman knew better when he turned against Lord Maynard Keynes economic principles.  The fact that \\"Free-Market Capitalism\\" led to the Great Depression was of little concern to Milton Friedman.  Friedman wanted revenge against all those Marxist factory workers who caused his daddy's sweatshop shirt factory in Rahway, NJ to fail. So what if 50% of Argentinians were plunged into poverty because of his implemented Chicago School policies, what did Milton Friedman care?  Friedman was part of the \\"in-crowd\\" just like Henry Kissinger, Robert Rubin and Ben Bernanke.  Socially responsible behavior belongs to suckers and losers.  Survival of the fittest is the mantra of the Shock Doctrine boys (yes, neo-cons are sexists).  Just ask George W Bush about how many WMDs we found in Iraq.    In every country that holds free elections, voters always reject the shock doctrine of disaster capitalism. Voters are always for social programs, government controls, and keeping domestic industries protected from foreign competition and foreign investors. Naomi Klein's conclusion is that capitalism and democracy are incompatible and Milton Friedman was just a big fat liar.    This book is detailed, well researched and thoroughly referenced.  As an experienced print and video political economics journalist Naomi Klein is uniquely qualified to write this book and her conclusions are both incisive as well as depressing.    I'm sorry that I didn't read this book when it was first released.  I would have better understood the depths of depravity that Uncle Milty sunk as his economic hypotheses were tested around the world by Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Bush I and II.  Naomi Klein could easily coin the phrase \\"corruption is good\\" as a conclusion to all the criminal activities performed in the name of Milton Friedman's \\"free market economics.\\"  The current \\"Wall Street\\" movie starring Michael Douglass mantra of \\"greed is good\\" is quaint in this age of $multi-trillion dollar credit default swaps and $multi-trillion dollar bailouts of the banksters to the detriment of Western civil society.     Lastly, Naomi Klein doesn't directly address the complete takeover of American mass media by the Business Round Table.  As a paid employee of the Canadian Broadcasting System I believe she recognizes which side her bread is buttered.    A good follow-on book to read is Joseph Stiglitz's \\"Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy.\\"  You can see Stiggy on You Tube and it will further open your eyes to the Chicago Boys Treachery.      http://www.amazon.com/Freefall-America-Markets-Sinking-Economy/dp/0393338959/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1289686196&sr=1-1
0156027321|3.0|I admit I read books that have a lot of hype. I don't like to feel like I'm being left out and I figure if everyone loves a book, it must at least be entertaining (I should probably stop this line of thought seeing that many of my favorite books are not popular). I had high expectations for Life of Pi and it just didn't come close to living up to them. I loved the concept of the book (and my goodness, I LOVE the book's cover).<br /><br />I was bored at times, as I felt the story dragged on and on. It was too surreal for me at points. I can totally handle \\"magical realism\\" to an extent, but this was just too much for me. Meh, I was disappointed. But you know, I'm still giving this 3 stars because I'm fairly certain most of my disappointment was due to my high expectations. The writing was fabulous, the story had a lot of depth and was actually quite good once I got past all the surrealism.<br /><br />I'm glad I read it to see what it was all about, but I'm not adding it to my favorite books list any time soon.
B002SQ364Q|4.0|Recapturing the spirit of Woodstock, the legendary 1969 rock music festival in Bethel, New York, must have been a daunting task for director Ang Lee's 2009 film \\"Taking Woodstock.\\" You have to battle overwhelming myth while recreating a moment of surreal magic 40 years down the road. Lee succeeds with a wonderful, often times comedic outsider's view on the edges of the enormous festival. It's a tremendous accomplishment.    Only a few filmmakers as brave as Lee ([[ASIN:B00005JOFQ Brokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000056BSG The Ice Storm]]) would have tackled this story. First and foremost, you must muscle to the top of a tall, muddy hill to stand alongside the brilliant, Oscar-winning documentary [[ASIN:B001NXDSLQ Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music Director's Cut (40th Anniversary Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. Lee essentially joins forces, utilizing similar split screens, faded color stock and recreating several famous moments (nuns flashing peace signs, the couple wrapped in an American flag, the Port-O-San man). Secondly, you're making a film that, while intricately woven into the festival's fabric, rarely takes place near the music. Ultimately, it's an Altmanesque slice of life and one of my favorite films of 2009.    Based on Elliot Tiber's book [[ASIN:0757003338 Taking Woodstock]], the film details what is primarily a true story of youthful Elliot (Demetri Martin) living at his parents' rundown homestead in Bethel. Days are spent trying to keep his parents' dilapidated hotel afloat while serving as the timid president of the chamber of commerce. A dreary existence, he's trapped by loyalty to an oppressive mother (Imelda Staunton), disinterested dad (Henry Goodman) and a local banker threatening foreclosure. When Tiber reads about a neighboring rock music festival losing its permit, he fatefully decides to give promoter Michael Lang ([[ASIN:0061576581 The Road to Woodstock]]) a call. Tiber hopes that by hosting the festival, he can get his parents' hotel out of hock and thus, the seeds of Woodstock are planted.    Within days, the Tiber hotel becomes the frantic headquarters for concert organizers, helicopters regularly landing in the yard, and Lang himself (wonderfully played by Jonathan Groff) striking up a friendship. Tiber is the straight man amidst chaos, viewing parades of hippies and businessmen from afar. He's our navigator through history and on the verge of coming-of-age. In reality, Tiber was a closeted homosexual and credits Woodstock with allowing him to embrace his sexuality. This is faintly touched upon, though never with satisfying detail. He has a crush on a burly stage builder, and they steal a momentary kiss. A former marine-turned transvestite Vilma appears (Liev Schreiber, excellent as usual), serving as the unlikely Tiber protecting angel.     When the festival begins, the film has several unforgettable moments -  a pond where nude bathers relax as the first distant chords of Richie Havens' \\"Freedom\\" ([[ASIN:B0000032YW Best of]]) floats on the summer breeze; Elliot catching a ride with a motorcycle policeman and riding through massive throngs of cars and hippies in a brilliant continuous take; and an impromptu stop at a VW bus overlooking the distant stage. These are the films most extraordinary scenes as introverted Tiber becomes one with the largest youth gathering in American history (they say 400,000, but who knows?). It's an intimate view of an epic setting, as he resides in the comfort of the VW bus, staring at a ceiling of psychedelic paintings. Slowly, after dropping acid for the first time, the artwork, not to mention the gregarious California hippie couple (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner) begin to glow and move, and they lovingly embrace, laugh and partake in this incredible moment in time. As Tiber steps outside the bus at nightfall, the land is marked by hundreds of campfires surrounding the stage. Tiber dances as the star-studded sky becomes one with the land, and you realizein this tearfully beautiful scene, Lee has captured the Woodstock moment.    I found several of the dramas eventually playing out to be abrupt and clumsy. I would have liked more closure with Schreiber's Vilma, not to mention Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy). These crucial supporting characters essentially disappear and Tiber's homosexuality is also forgotten. So while \\"Taking Woodstock\\" is a maddeningly imperfect film lacking a poetic conclusion, it is a creative companion to the famous documentary. Lee succeeds against enormous odds, creating a valentine work embracing an extraordinary collage of spiritual freedom.
0307454541|5.0|Some will tell you to buy into the hype. Some will tell you not to. I say buy into it. I really don't think you'll regret it. The book starts off really slowly, but if you push on past the first 100 pages, it gets really good.<br /><br />I'm really big on reading the book before seeing the movie, and that goes for this book especially. I mean it! The book has so much more suspense than the movie and you'll get a lot more out of the book than you will the movie, which leaves a lot of details out.<br /><br />Once you get passed the beginning, it's a quick read. And worth it. I could take or leave the other two books, but this one is a must-read!
1599218011|5.0|I love this book!  I had been thinking to myself over the last year or so that I need to start eating better and treating my body better.  Then in July of 2010 I found out I have breast cancer.  That wake up call brought me to my discovery of Kris Carr.  I don't know how I would have handled my cancer challenge without her.  I love her other two books and when I heard she wrote a diet book I pre-ordered it as soon as I could get to my computer.  If you have ever thought to yourself that you would like to eat better, treat your mind and body better, and feel better in general, this may be a great book for you.  It is a fun book, with just enough detail on diet and lifestyle to get you informed and started on the road to better health.  I have many books on diet, food, and health, but have always found them hard to get through.  There seems to be to much information on a subject, not enough, or the book is just plain boring and hard to read.  Kris's humor and approach makes it interesting, fun and realistic to learn and make changes in your world to become a better person, physically, mentally and emotionally.  I can't say enough about how much I love this book and how much of a positive impact Kris and her posse have made on my life!
1597801585|3.0|Despite a tedious start, some stilted prose, and multiple unnecessarily graphic sexual abuse scenes (which may add shock-value but detract from the story), I still think Bacigalupi has written something remarkable here.  This \\"bio-punk\\" saga is the hyper-organic dystopian antithesis of cyberpunk.  Traditional resources, tech, and basic human protections are lost to profiteering, unrestrained bioengineering, and outright ethnic discrimination.  All that is left is the search for calories, hopefully derived from foods free of human-engineered disease.  On top of this, Bacigalupi stacks elements of racism, sexism, classism, and religious violence, some of which can be hauntingly familiar, given the rather exotic setting.  The key, though, is that Bacigalupi manages to convey all of this without whining.  His characters could stand further development, but the ruthless real-world parallels to our own squandering of natural resources coupled with ethical neglect in competitive agro-engineering provide a great deal of food for thought.  A fascinating read, despite the disgusting bits.
B00005JKC3|5.0|Everything about the first one is far better than the second. Acting, script, fight scenes, the entire story far surpasses the second.
0156034565|2.0|Torday's book fails to find a voice for its characters, the humor, or any social angle, leaving the reader thirsting. Torday gives readers a glint of real people, like the flash of a salmon in turgid water, but characters fail to leap off the page. He strains credulity to create space for a bemused irony over government, Arabs, science, and venality. And the book's structure, which allows almost every character to speak first person, is wasted here since so many of the voices sound the same, and all are too literary.    The book hint's at a rip-roaring good novel, full of human exposition and wry observation. But it, alas, is as dry as a wadi in summer.
6305882592|4.0|Some films, especially coming of age films of either the political or social kind, do not age well. That is the fate of the early 1970s cult classic of sorts, Harold and Maude. This was a film that some friends of mine in Cambridge would queue up for on a weekly basis, and gladly, at one particular theater that played the film and only that film for about a year. See, that was the time of the great attempted late 1960s break-out from the confines of bourgeois society and the tracked career path by all kinds of people and Harold seemed a kindred spirit, and was then. Maude, needless to say was everybody's grandmother dream, if only compared to harsh mother reality, and if you liked little old ladies in tennis sneakers. And you should.     The premise of the film certainly had appeal, teen angst, big time teen angst by the distraught Harold (Bud Cort) trying to, against his class background and his monster mother's well-laid plans for his future, fight for his place in the world (or the next world in his faux fascination with death and funerals) and old age angst (happy angst, if that is not an oxymoron) by the bubbly Maude (Ruth Gordon). By the end of the film old Ruth is able to bring Bud around to seeing that life, his life, is worth living. Well, ho hum for the premise now, now that some of us are approaching old Maude's age.     What is false here, maybe not as false as some things we have learned along the way but false nevertheless, is Maude's aged wisdom. The truth, the bitter truth, is that the wisdom we acquired was done so in our youth and we have been living off that, chipping away at the edges, ever since. What still holds up, and holds well, is the sound track of Cat Stevens' (now Yusuf Islam) great songs like Wild World and Where Do The Children Play? Wordsworth had it right- to be young was very heaven.
B002ZG997M|4.0|I was hesitant to watch The Book of Eli for a while because of mixed things I'd read. Some people claimed it to be 'too religious' and others said the movie was just plain boring. Honestly, the trailers I'd seen didn't exactly win me over, but I gave the movie a shot when I was sick one day, and man did I enjoy it. If you've played the Fallout games, especially Fallout 3, you will -love- The Book of Eli. So many similarities in the look of the wasteland, in the combat scenes, the importance of water, and more. But even if you never played Fallout 3, The Book of Eli is a very enjoyable movie, provided you're not one of those people that immediately hates anything 'religious' and claims a movie is preachy, given that the subject matter here is religion...so that kind of makes you weird to say that. I'm not a Christian, and I'm definitely not an Atheist, but I didn't find anything 'preachy' about The Book of Eli.    The world is in shambles. There's no law for the most part. Raiders are everywhere, looting, raping and eating people that pass by. Clean water and food is tough to find. Of course it's a rough life. Most people wouldn't think much of it, but imagine your life as you know it right now taking a turn for the worst, and you no longer have any luxuries- you're a scavenger from now on. That's the world Eli lives in. Eli is on a mission, and tries to stay on the path, as he puts it, and needs to go to a specific location to deliver an important book that no one else is allowed to see or read. At the same time, the ability to read has been lost over the years, and very few people are able to do so. Eli is one, and the other is a corrupt man, Carnegie, who runs a town that Eli enters one day to charge his iPod and haggle with the shop owner. Carnegie wants Eli's book, and will stop at nothing to get it. Unfortunately for him, Eli is practically Zatoichi when it comes to swordplay, and easily dispatches Carnegie's men with his makeshift machete, and is even better with a gun. But Carnegie is relentless, and continues to hunt down Eli.    While the plot itself isn't anything special, the style of the movie is. Rarely do I notice the cinematography in movies, but I noticed it within the first 10 minutes here. The wasteland is gorgeous, as weird as that may sound, and if there were more footage of Eli wandering around in it, I would've been ok with that. The fight scenes are all great- not too long and not too short. Another Fallout 3 connection I saw here was that in the game, you can use VATS (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) to target the enemy's body parts, and get an easy kill/dismemberment that way. I swear, Eli used VATS for all of his kills, because he took out everyone in the same way you would in Fallout 3- precise targeting. There's a big twist near the end of the movie, though I did see it coming when I figured something out about Eli early on that most people didn't, but it's still a great touch, and I had a huge stupid smile on my face when it was revealed. Of course the book he's carrying is obviously The Bible, as you see shots of the cover several times before the halfway point, but I won't say any more about it so that the ending isn't ruined. As I said earlier, I didn't find the movie to be 'preachy' at all, and that's because this is a movie about religion- it doesn't try to be something else, and then throw in a forced message at the last minute. But at the same time, you could've replaced the Bible with any other religious book, and it would've been fine or given the same message. Eli is a man of god, and given how great he is in action, you have to wonder if he hasn't been blessed in some way. But trust me when I say that the movie isn't boring. While it is inspirational, there's plenty of action to go around, including a great scene with an elderly couple, and Eli making good use of his bow and arrow on some thugs. The action is fun, plain and simple. The ONLY bad thing I say is about the immediate ending- the last couple of minutes before the credits roll. I actually said \\"you gotta be kidding me\\" out loud when it happened, and if I were reviewing just the movie on its own, it'd get 3.5 stars. Had they not gone that route, this would be an easy 4 star movie in my book.    The picture quality on the blu-ray is very good for what it is. The look of the movie is very washed out, with lots of greys, browns and -very- deep blacks. Even with the muted look, details are sharp, and the movie is beautiful to look at. The audio's even better, making excellent use of the DTS-HD Master Audio track. Sandstorms and the sound of wind blowing by are constant, gunshots explode around you, and dialogue is perfectly balanced with everything else, so nothing sounds too loud or quiet compared to whatever else is going on. Very nice work here. There are also 5.1 Spanish and French tracks, as well as subtitles in English, Spanish and French.    As for the extras, The Book of Eli doesn't disappoint here either. Maximum Movie Mode is here, allowing you to watch the movie with picture-in-picture of storyboards and concept art for their matching scenes. It's very cool, and makes me wish there were an art book for the movie so I could have an easier time looking at everything! You also get 10 Focus Points, which are featurettes on different aspects of making the movie like weapons, stunts, design and more. Basically, everything you'd get on a commentary track is in these two features right here. There's an animated comic, A Lost Tale, that runs for about 5 minutes and kind of shows what made Carnegie the man he is in the movie. I didn't care for the animation, and there isn't much to it when it comes down to it, but it's still nice to have. Rounding out the extras are a quick featurette on the movie's soundtrack, a few minutes of deleted/alternate scenes (nothing important here) and two good featurettes: one about the rise and fall of civilizations and rebuilding society, and a basic featurette going over the making of the movie (script/filming).    Overall, this is a great blu-ray, and if it weren't for that head shakingly bad ending, I would've given this 5 stars. The Book of Eli is one of the better post-apocalyptic movies out there (especially since it doesn't ruin anything by cramming zombies into the mix), and I'd put close to the same level as A Boy & His Dog. Heck, have a movie night with those two and enjoy some Fallout 3 when everything's over. Have an ice cold Nuka-Cola, and you've got a friday night right there.

B001TOD92C|4.0|Great movie. Shows what one has to do to keep making it. Micky Rourke is past his prime but has no other skills to survive (although he tries).Shows his contrant struggle to make end meet. Hooks up with Marisa Tomei who is in the same boat as Micky, just in a completly different profession. They show great balance and believable characters and they both try to get through life using their skills, even if those skills are begining to fade. Worth watching. A must have for any serious movie buff.
B00428CPUY|5.0|Real brief:    This was the best concert I've ever been to in my life and this DVD does it justice. If you were at the concert and/or are just a fan of great guitar work, get the DVD.    My only complaints (and they are very minor), are that I wish they would have shown a little more of Joe Bonamassa (who I believe is on the cusp of becoming the world's pre-eminent blues-rock guitarist), and I really would have liked to have seen Rhonda Smith's (Beck's bassist) epic bass solo again.    The entire concert was awesome, but Guy-Wood-Lang was a religious experience. Cudos to the producers for including all of 'Miss You', including Buddy busting his string. Epic.

0446195529|4.0|The latest installment of the Camel Club mysteries gives readers more action, adventure, and the relentless hunt for some very bad killers who seem to have limitless resources, great skill, and contacts at the highest levels of government. The chapters read quickly, with lots of exciting and technically realistic action that is the author's trademark. Unfortunately, the action is interrupted by stretches of dialogue, which were a little too plentiful for this type of novel. Overall, this is a pretty good adventure, but not Baldacci's best.<br /><br />The author, true to his style, does not delve into psychological depths or areas of moral uncertainty: it is not that kind of novel. Baldacci writes straight forward, hard hitting thrillers, with action, good guys and bad guys, and a wide gulf between them. Although the main character regrets some of his past deeds, he does not shy away from a fight, or lose his way in self accusation and doubt.<br /><br />I like the way the author includes little details about history and famous places in his novels.  For example, I did a little research on the Resolute desk in the first chapter, and learned something about U.S. history. I checked the details about places, history and technology in a number of chapters, and found that Baldacci had done his homework.<br /><br />There is the usual trouble with realism in a novel of this sort. How could such an outsider as our main character get called into a meeting with the president? Why does he get access to so many restricted places? How do the villains pull off so many attacks, and get away without a trace? Books of this nature tend to demand a lot of believability from the reader.  If you like this type of novel, you will not be bothered. I enjoyed this book, and I read it to the end eagerly, turning the pages faster as I went. The suspense builds slowly, and the last part of the novel is the best part. I can recommend Hells' Corner enthusiastically for all of Baldacci's fans, and those who will be his fans.ans.

When Lavinia is allowed into the \\"big house\\", she finds herself on the border between severely different and utterly unequal worlds. Lavinia must make drastic choices with cruel consequences, in this captivating and suspenseful chronicle. Highly recommended. 10 CDs, 13 hours, tracks every three minutes for easy bookmarking.
0140282688|5.0|This is a hilarious and embarrassing coming of age tail.  The protagonist lives with is mother well beyond his years and drives her to drink with his antics.  He is an overweight misfit with very strong opinions and very few marketing stills that must find a job to make some money to keep his mother for going to jail for crashing her car into a house.  The set of outrageous characters, the outdated chivalry of the protagonist in contrast to his vulgar, slovenly, and gluttonous appearance and his intense focus on some valve in his stomach make for some hilarious antics as this crazy character is launched into the working world.  I laughed out loud the many times.  I also drank in the kind of New York/New Orleans connected cultures and characters which abound - most of them quite odd.

0545123275|5.0|Years ago, when Grace was attacked by wolves, Sam saved her. He has been a presence in Grace's life ever since always lurking on the periphery each winter in Mercy Falls, watching her, protecting her.<br /><br />Even though they have never spoken.<br /><br />Sam has been watching Grace for years, waiting for her, making sure she was safe. Even when he couldn't remember her name he knew she mattered. He knew he loved her even if it was impossible because of what he was.<br /><br />No matter how Grace and Sam might feel about each other there is always one insurmountable truth separating them: Sam is a wolf.<br /><br />A werewolf more specifically.<br /><br />Every year when the temperature drops, Sam changes into a wolf--Grace's wolf, the one always watching her from a safe distance--trapped in his changed form until spring when the temperatures rise and he can become Sam again.<br /><br />That was Sam's reality, his unavoidable truth, and the one thing Grace never really believed. At least, not until she met Sam, the real Sam.<br /><br />Once Grace knows the truth, sees her wolf made human, losing him is unimaginable.<br /><br />Being with Grace is all Sam has ever wanted; the one thing he always held onto as a wolf.<br /><br />But the temperature is falling in Mercy Falls and with the looming threat of winter Grace and Sam are running out of time in Shiver (2009) by Maggie Stiefvater.<br /><br />Shiver is superficially a paranormal/supernatural* romance with werewolves. But, really, it is so much more than that.<br /><br />Poetic and urgent, Stiefvater's writing is poised to exceed expectations and stay with readers. Told in chapters alternating between Grace and Sam's voices the urgency of winter's approach and the strength of our heroes' love are both tangible. Grace and Sam are a charmingly authentic couple in a town filled with well-developed and unforgettable characters of both human and lupine persuasions.<br /><br />Shiver is, really, just a beautiful book. The physical design from the cover (with art by Christopher Stengel) down to the text printed in blue ink is just as impressive as Stiefvater's original take on werewolves in this complex, charming and extremely satisfying start to a what promises to be a stunning trilogy.<br /><br />Grace and Sam's story continues in Linger (which is printed in green ink).<br /><br />Possible Pairings: Fire and Hemlock by Diana Wynne Jones, Beautiful Creatures by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, Sea Change by Aimee Friedman, Finnikin of the Rock by Melina Marchetta, Wildwood Dancing by Juliet Marillier, Twilight by Stephenie Meyer, The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffeneggerº, A Well-Timed Enchantment by Vivian Vande Velde<br /><br />*Are paranormal and supernatural different things in the publishing world?

B003VB5E2E|1.0|I waited for a year for this Crossroads 2010 blue ray to come out and watched it tonight...whew! what a stinkfest!.At this point Eric owes me $29.95 and 2 hours of my life back.I also must admit that i am a huge blues fan and have the other two crossroads dvd's and this borefest misses the mark completely.<br />The only light in this dvd is the VERY small part that John Mayer and Joe Bonnamassa play in this concert.There is not enough hydroponic weed in the world to make the tired sound of Jimmy Vaughan(listen to \\"six Strings Down\\" and try not to laugh out loud),Los Lobos and equally bad performances by Buddy Guy and a drunk as ever Ron Wood sound palatable.<br />Even Claptons performance was contrived and lacked the laser like intensity that his solos normally have...and why play\\"I shot the Sheriff\\" again after playing it so well on the first DVD surely his catalouge is vast enough not to repeat this particular song as well as the other exact tunes he played with Steve Winwood on the 2nd Crossroads DVD.<br />ZZ Top was about as exciting as watching paint dry.This dvd is simply a re-hash of the other two Much Better crossroads dvd's that have gone before it...and that is a travesty considering what this festival started out as and the talent that could have been chosen to represent guitar and the blues.<br /><br />This dvd is a pale comparison to the original Crossroads dvd that was filled with excellent artists and musical numbers that were bang on the money...this felt tired and old to the point that even Jeff Becks spot was just ok.And can someone please tell me why Sheryl Crow is still haunting this event? her contribution was about as good as Bill Murray was Funny that day and night..his comedy was non existent as the MC of the concert..oh i get it he's dressed like Jimmi Hendrix then stands there and mumbles as the crowd looses their tolerence of his lame act?.<br /><br />Nope... this is not the concert dvd you want to spend hard earned dollars on period ...if i could return this turkey i would do so tommorow as i will not watch it again...absolute utter dissapointment.i would do so tommorow as i will not watch it again...absolute utter dissapointment.
B000KKPN5C|2.0|This is at best a built in flash substitute but it even fails at that since the built in flash in D80, D90, D200, D300, D700 etc. can be used for the built in commander mode which this doesn't.  Speaking of commander mode, you can't use this as a remote flash.  You also don't get an LCD screen on this model so there is no flash compensation.   Power is lacking, and you can't bounce this the way you can with the higher end models.      Save up and at least get an SB-600.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|You won't find many films like Scott Pilgrim VS. The World, which is a crying shame because it is so unbelievably enjoyable and just plain awesome that putting it into words is proving rather difficult.  Based on the comic and directed by Shaun of the Dead helmer Edgar Wright, Michael Cera stars as Scott, whose dreamgirl Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has seven evil exes whom he must defeat.  Filled with crap-tons of classic video game references and influences, as well as combos, the defeated transforming into coins, dueling band battles, and slightly giving the finger to hipsters everywhere; Scott Pilgrim VS. The World is one of the absolute best comic to film adaptations to see the light of day, made all the better by Wright's brilliant directing and features Cera in a lead role that isn't quite along the same boring ilk that his previous roles have been either.  This cavalcade of awesomeness also features great turns from Jason Schwartzman, Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, Anna Kendrick, Kieran Culkin, and more besides.  Do yourself a favor, check out Scott Pilgrim, even if you've never checked out the comic...you'll be quite happy that you did.
B0044XV3QY|4.0|The BOTTOM line about Avatar is that it WORKED, from a writing and visual standpoint. It's not high art from a story telling angle, but visually it's amazing. To dismiss it as anything less is utterly foolish. Being hugely popular makes it a BIG target, but that's about it. I remember the same dreary complaints when Star Wars was released and the awful reviews for Blade Runner. It's always the same with visionary material and I think there's some real jealousy involved by wannabe artists.   As far as the various versions....GET OVER IT! I have a dedicated theater in my house that cost more than a VERY nice car and then some. I have a 130 inch screen with HD projection. Until a proper 3D system for a projector is out and working well, this gibbering over 3D TV's is a laugh. I own the 3D Samsung and 3D on it is fair at best. It's just too SMALL. So for now...who cares about watching 3D on a 50\\" display? It's not much fun and a strain on the eyes. You need a BIG screen in a dark room for 3D to really work well. Sorry.  So Avatar looks AMAZING in 2D and it's even more involving without the 3D process. In fact several people watching it in 2D already commented on how they see so much more detail without the 3D process. I agree and I also don't like the 1/4 to 1/2 stop light loss (reduced brightness) with ALL 3D systems. Add to that the crappy optics of the glasses and you get a very diminished viewing experience.  So....I'll order the new Avatar version.    Bye!      The Good Captain

B000O179HW|3.0|I know that Dreamgirls was originally a Broadway musical.  But I didn't know the movie would be. The previews show the movie as being a movie musical drama of a fictional pop girl-group from the 60's, done in a biography style. That was what made me want to see it.  I never saw this film until I bought the HD/DVD version.    Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson are enough reason to watch this movie. Beyonce's cruves, beauty, and sweet voice are prefect as always.  And Hudson's attitude, and gospel like voice belted out with perfect pitch.  She proved beyond any doubt that she can sing and act like a pro. The story is a great tribute to the music and lives of the pioneers who revolutionized the music industry of the times.    Jamie Fox wore his role like a glove.  But Eddie Murphy disappointed me. I am a big fan of Eddie Murphy movies and comedy routines.  But his character did not fit the role is this story.  He can not sing very well, and he is not the type to play a \\"Ladies man\\" role.  He was not convincing.  I kept waiting for him to break out into a comedy routine with his signature laugh.    The only other part that did not fit into this fim was the singing of the story lines. Every time they got into a good dramatic part, they would break out into a musical singing the words. This reduced the dramatic feel of the moment to something kind of phony. This wasn't the movie musical \\"Oklahoma\\" or \\"Funny Girl\\". It was a story of a fictional singing group. It would have been much better as a good dramatic bio type movie instead of a musical.    Still, I enjoyed the story, and the Dreams musical numbers were fantastic. The poetice justic in favor of Hudson's character was a very sweet ending. I cheered.  It is worth it just to see and hear Beyonce and Jennifer.  They are the only true stars that shine in this movie. But well worth watching.
0517548232|5.0|When I lost my job 3 years ago I wanted to know why!  Why have I been financially set back twenty five years?  Why the harder I worked, the more hours I put in the more the state and federal government took away from me.    What was wrong with the American dream?    I started my journey to learn economics with this book and when I finished each chapter the angrier I got...  By the time I finished it I was furious.  See I learned that Government was the blame for all this financial misery.  Government bureaucrats and politicians who are economic ignoramuses making legislation and regulation who don't take into consideration the long term ramifications of these laws in destroying our nation's economy.  This has been in the making for the last one hundred years until we have reached the point we are now.    And what do we have now?  We have a Central Planed Socialist nightmare that has eaten away the free market to the point where it is almost unrecognizable in this country.    This is what the great Austrian Economists have warned us about.    \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" by Henry Hazlitt is simply brilliant!  It's the place to start.  A very easy read, easy to understand and guaranteed to give you the ability to see easily what's currently going on and how these bad governmental decisions lead us to ruin.    Once you finish this book and you crave more... I suggest F.A. Hayek \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" and also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute on line... They have a great website with audio lessons available.    If you have a deep passion for this nation, I can't stress more on spreading the word about fine books like this one.  The more people that learn these simple economic lessons, the better the chance we can change the course of this nation and hopefully return to a land of prosperity for our future generations.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|The video review of this product is pretty much spot on. And yes, as some have said, there is a small hiss but I found once you're playing the game, it doesn't matter because, well, all you here is the video game. Set up is real easy. Headphones are very light as well. Love the mute and bass options as well. Cord is plenty long. Buying this actually made me pick up my FPS and it made a WORLD of difference.

B00421IR5I|5.0|My daughter needed this film for her high school French class.  She asked me to watch it with her.  I have to admit that I sat there and laughed with her the whole time.  It is charming and sweet -- and oh, so funny.  You will fall in love with the characters -- children and adults.  It is a movie to be enjoyed by people of all ages, of any language.
B00406UK7S|3.0|This movie is a me-too movie attempting to capitalize off the success of pseudo histories such as Robin Hood and Arthur. My first objection to the movie is the font they chose to write the subtitles, locations, and plot points. It was difficult to read on my analog TV, especially when they opt for white on a pale blue background using an ancient looking font that is difficult to decipher in the first place. Now the reason why we have subtitles is for the Picts, who are native of Northern Britain. They don't speak English, but the Romans speak 21st century English, including one soldier with a British accent. \\"Sorry mate, but orders are orders,\\" he says as he slices a Pict throat. OH PLEASE! If the Picts don't speak modern English, don't try to make it realistic with subtitles only to have the Romans speak English. The language spoken by the Picts is actually unknown.<br /><br />A Roman governor wanting to make a name for himself, opts to send the 9th Roman legion into the Pict stronghold in order to kill their king. The Roman governor uses a female Pict slave (whose parents were murdered by Romans, with her being raped as a child and her tongue cut out) to guild them into Pict territory. Guess how that works out Scooby-Doo? The ninth legion is wiped out except for the general who is taken captive and 7 Romans (who look more like an international group). They opt to do the stupid thing and attempt to rescue the general in the heart of a Pict camp. After they fail at that, they are hunted by Picts. For those who like killing, blood, urine, and violence this is your film. The overly simplistic plot, lack of good characterization, making us identify with the bad guys who we know will lose, poor attempts at humor, makes this the least enjoyable of the pseudo histories to date. They spent a lot of money making this film and wasted it on an inferior script.<br /><br />The story of the missing ninth Roman legion being destroyed by the Picts is legend. It actually got transferred to Judea.erred to Judea.
B002G1YPH0|3.0|I read the reviews before purchasing this heat sink.  It does have thermal compound included.  The directions consist of diagrams with no words.  After studying them long enuff, you can figure out how to install the fan.  Mounting is questionable, but solid.  This is very heavy.  It is also big.  120mm is over kill.  It takes up a big portion of my case.  Make sure you measure.  I have a mid tower and had less than an inch before touching the side panel.  I have a see through panel, and can't show much off with the room this takes up.  The price is good, but the features are not.  I recommend you look elsewhere.

B003Y8YXH6|4.0|I was in my early twenties when John Lennon was shot, and this recording never fails to make me a bit sad.<br />This was John and Yoko's last recording ( Other than milk and Honey), and it was at the time very ground breaking. It was John's announcement to the world that getting older and having a domestic life and relationship was cool. Since we all grew up with Beatle John, we never stopped looking to him for guidance, and here in his final recording- he was telling us to shed our immature star lust and get real.<br />The music goes from OK to great. John's backup band was first rate, and they really augmented John's pristine vocals and song writing. Yoko had some surprisingly good songs, despite her weak voice. All and all- buy this recording- at least for the stripped down version, which really gives it a honest and immediate sound. John's vocals were first rate, and the stripped down version really highlights this.<br />There will never be another John Lennon, and I doubt in today's world of immediate gratification and constant electronic distractions, his message would get through anyway. But for us that were there and still listen- this is classic Lennon.
B0036CWK8O|3.0|With \\"Unarmed\\", Helloween put themselves into an untenable position: Release yet another \\"best of\\" album when \\"Treasure Chest\\" was still fresh in people's minds and be accused of double-dipping, or have a little fun with their classic material and be accused of \\"selling out\\" and \\"ruining\\" their classic material by people who don't get it? Helloween opted for the latter.     Does it work? Some of the songs, like \\"If I Could Fly\\" \\"Forever and One\\", \\"Why?\\" and \\"A Tale That Wasn't Right\\" sound quite good with the new orchestration. Some of the songs, like \\"Eagle Fly Free\\", \\"Future World\\"\\" and \\"Where The Rain Grows\\" are, for lack of a better word, weird.  Some of the songs, like \\"Perfect Gentleman\\" and \\"I Want Out\\", make a smile creep across your face.  And then there's \\"The Keeper's Trilogy\\"and \\"Fallen to Pieces\\", unbelievable re-imaginings of great tunes. On the whole, however, the album is merely a mixed bag.  Some good stuff, some not-so good stuff, some stuff that makes you scratch your head, and some stuff that makes you say \\"hmmmm... I never thought about going in that direction but I like it!\\"    What people, notably, those who are up in arms and outraged that Helloween would \\"ruin\\" the classic Hansen/Kiske songs, seem to be missing is that Helloween never intended these songs to be \\"new\\" versions of their classic material.  Nor were they intended to replace the originals. It was meant as a sort of \\"What If\\" experiment, and in that respect it succeeds well.  Could they have pulled a \\"Blast from the Past\\" and re-recorded all their classic material ala Gamma Ray?  They could have, but in the end it would have been a foolhardy endeavor. The Kiske - Deris debate perpetually rages on and the band would have done itself no favors by trying to recapture the magic of the classics with the new lineup. This was probably the best way to handle it: You want the classics as you remember them?  Get \\"Treasure Chest\\".  You want a different take on the classics?  Get \\"Unarmed\\".The band treats \\"Unarmed\\" as an exercise in fun, just letting themselves cut loose, critics be damned.  In stark contrast to \\"Chameleon\\", which was the band, their management, and their record company trying to force-feed a new Helloween down the fans' throats, \\"Unarmed\\" is nothing of the sort.  Helloween is not saying \\"this is the direction we're headed in so get used to it\\".  They tried that once and failed miserably.  \\"Unarmed\\" is them just having fun.  And in the end isn't that the Helloween that we all know and love?     If it's not your cup of tea, no sweat. \\"7 Sinners\\" more than makes up for it. But \\"Unarmed\\" is at least worth listening to, although I only see Helloween's most hardcore fans and completists actually shelling out the dough to buy it.  Mildly recommended.

B0042AEOG0|4.0|Mariah Carey has released a fine second holiday album full of superlative music that she sings very well. Sure, some people may say that she didn't sing certain songs the way they would have preferred her to sing them; but all in all I still think this is a solid album and it's selling well, so overall I think she did things right. The quality of the sound is excellent, too. I must admit it's not completely what I wanted; the \\"extra festive\\" rendition of \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\" could have been much more noticeably different than the original version that Mariah released back in the 1990s; and there's that switching back and forth between original studio recordings and much more recent live recordings on \\"O Holy Night.\\"<br /><br />So, as you can see, I have my favorites on this CD as you will, too. After a brief intro of \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,\\" we get Mariah singing out strong on that pop, catchy sounding tune entitled \\"Oh Santa!\\" with an excellent musical arrangement to accompany Mariah as she sings this faultlessly. The medley of \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" and \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" is very sweet; Mariah sings this with true passion and that's grand. \\"Christmas Time Is in the Air Again\\" charms me with its beauty; and listen for another great track, \\"The First Noel/Born Is the King (Interlude)\\" that has Mariah squarely front and center--right where she belongs! Mariah sings this number with a great deal of genuine heart and soul. \\"When Christmas Comes\\" is nice, too.<br /><br />\\"Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)/Housetop Celebration\\" again showcases Mariah's ability to sing a really snazzy number; and that music from \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\\" stuns me with its beauty. \\"O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah Chorus\\" and \\"One Child\\" are both religious and very easy on the ear; and the album ends with the very well done \\"Auld Lang Syne - The New Year's Anthem.\\" This last number gets a fine interpretation and delivery from Mariah who never lets go of a single superfluous note!<br /><br />Mariah Carey's second album of holiday music has a lot to offer despite a minor bump or two from those switches between studio and live recordings on \\"O Holy Night\\" and the practically identical \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\\" I recommend this album for Mariah Carey fans; and people who want high quality control holiday music would do well to get this album for their collections.a single superfluous note!    Mariah Carey's second album of holiday music has a lot to offer despite a minor bump or two from those switches between studio and live recordings on \\"O Holy Night\\" and the practically identical \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\\" I recommend this album for Mariah Carey fans; and people who want high quality control holiday music would do well to get this album for their collections.
B0041CGP02|4.0|Bon Jovi are the greatest rock band and the ultimate greatest hits is a great compilation of Bon Jovi Hits, but not perfect.  Bon Jovi have so many hits that it's impossible to fit all of them in and also impossible to please all the fans, which is why alot of people make their own greatest hits cd's, so considering all that the following is only one fan's opinion.    Bon Jovi always offer something new even on their greatest hits albums which is awesome but considering this is actually a ultimate Bon Jovi Greatest Hits representation, they should have saved the new songs for the next album, this way more hits could have been included.  Also no songs were included from the Bounce album which was the only album not represented when you include bonus tracks etc. This is very unlike Bon Jovi who are normally so careful with what they release. \\"Everyday\\" from Bounce was the obvious selection that missed out.     Despite all that it's still a great compilation from Bon Jovi.

1439133948|3.0|This latest book in the Vorkosigan Saga takes us to an entirely new world.  If it was mentioned in any of the previous books, it was only in passing.  The world of Kobou-daini is run by corporations that specialize in cryofreezing.  The goal of everyone on planet is to have enough money on hand that when they become too ill, too old or too injured they can be frozen until a cure for what ails them is invented.  The corporations wound up running everything because someone who is cryofrozen is still, technically, alive.  Since Kobou-daini is nominally a \\"one-vote per person\\" democracy, the corporations that control the frozen body are permitted to cast their vote for them.     The culture of Kobou-daini is Asian with a little Egyptian thrown in.     The book begins very abruptly, which leaves the reader scrambling to figure out what's going on.  A lot of that orientation is covered in characters musing on how they got to be where they were.  It would have been much better to simply show us the action instead.  Once oriented the book becomes the traditional Miles Vorkosigan adventure, with Miles charging out to do what he feels needs to be done.  The book is co-narrated by Armsman Roic and Jin, a native boy.  This adds some nice viewpoints to get other takes on the action.     While seeing a new culture in Bujold's world was nice, it was a bit disappointing to have Miles so far from the Empire, and his family and friends.  A bit of something was missing.     Overall a decent book in the series, although not a great one.
055358894X|5.0|This book, thanks to George Martin's review, emerged with a lot of hype.  The first reviews came in positive, and expectations could scarcely have been higher.  That is usually the recipe for a major letdown, but this book lived up to the hype, and then some.<br /><br />This is a rock 'n roll romp; fantasy fiction as imagined by Jimi Hendrix, Fritz Lieber on speed.  Lynch uses familiar tropes, which for a lesser writer would be derivative, but his wordsmithery is at such a high-level that they are invigorated with new energy.<br /><br />Unlike Martin's work, I don't know that it has cross-genre appeal.  It might not appeal to those who don't regularly read spec fic.  For those who do, however, it's frenetic, fierce, fantastic prose is a treat for all.
B00004RFFS|4.0|This is one of my favorite films. I saw it before I read the book & was mesmerized. I read the novel at age 17, & instantly became a fan of Anne Rice. As has been addressed by many reviews & critics, the movie differs from the book in several ways, of which the first is that in the film the protagonist, Louis, states he has lost his wife & baby in childbirth, whereas in the book he felt responsible for the death of his brother. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, but his performance as the vampire Lestat was worthy of an acting award, & he certainly changed my mind that he could BE this character. I know my next comment won't be popular, but I think Brad Pitt's nonverbal acting as Louis was often more striking, powerful, & poignant than his dialogue. I know Louis is supposed to be despairing & disillusioned, but I'm sorry, I've always found much of Brad Pitt's verbal delivery flatlined & mediocre. Kirsten Dunst as Claudia the \\"woman-child\\" vampire imprisoned in her child's body for the rest of her existence while she mentally & emotionally matures, is haunting, stunning & unforgettable, which explains why she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Christian Slater gives a strong portrayal as the interviewer Daniel, and although Antonio Banderas does not fit the original character of Armand in the books (who is supposed to be a Russian auburn-haired 17-year old), Antonio is sinisterly captivating.<br />As a kind of footnote, Neil Jordan, the director, & the many other talented people involved with the production of IWTV did a remarkable job with the costumes, special effects, and the sets: one of the most memorable is the catacombs where the Theater of the Vampires (Theatre des Vampires) live in Paris. If you listen to Neil's dvd commentary about the making of this, you learn they really did shoot scenes in Paris when Louis & Claudia travel to Europe seeking other vampires. Elliot Goldenthal's emotive musical score also intensely adds to the atmosphere, & deserved the Oscar nomination he received. I now just wish that Neil Jordan or another visionary, daring director would make The Vampire Lestat, or remake a worthy version of Queen of the Damned more closely resembling Anne Rice's book.here, & deserved the Oscar nomination he received.

B003JTHESA|4.0|Maiden fans will never really get Iron Maiden songs from the '80's or early '90's (up to Fear of the Dark).  Since the Blaze Bayley era, it's been a more mature Maiden.  I have grown to enjoy the triple guitar attack + Bruce reunion albums.  They appear to have been listening to Pink Floyd & Hawkwind since 1999.  Brave New World, Dance of Death, A Matter of Life and Death, and Final Frontier are great albums.  Call these albums the result of a mature and introspective Iron Maiden. I like the place where they are. Congrats, gents!  You've hit your stride, and still kill live.
B003VCD58I|5.0|Maria Gadú  is an amazing young woman from Sao Paulo Brazil who just recently gained fame after several shows in Rio de Janeiro in 2009 that brought a lot of attention to her talents. Despite only being in her early 20's, she has been writing and recording her music for many,many years....She started recording on cassettes when she was only 7 years old..! If you like the sound of acoustic guitar,strings and Brazilian Portuguese sung with a beautiful voice, then this recording is for you. Every song on the album is really good too which is rare! Buy it!!... you wont regret it!!

I'll be reading Michael Caine's autobio next. Not an unfunny man himself, I'd say Mr Caine's going to have a tough act to follow.
0743435729|1.0|I liked On Basilik Station.  The writing was a little slow in parts, but Honor was a good character and over all it was a good read.  So I was looking forward to the next book in the series.  Unfortunately, I got this.    About 80% of the book is long drawn out descriptions of the strategy of space naval battles--strategy based on completely fictional science so that it all amounts to nothing more than authorial handwaving.  You'd be halfway through a scene actually relevant to the story and suddenly there'd be a three page detour into the centuries long history of hyper-space travel, none of which ever managed to relate back to the plot.    The book is basically 'blah, blah, blah lightspeed, blah, blah, blah, missiles, blah, blah, blah, impeller wall.'  There's a little bit of a plot too, something about religious fanatics... I kinda lost track amongst all the quasi-scientific gibberish.    Oh, and Honor, who I liked in the first book, ran away because all the male chauvinists were picking on her, then she came back and suddenly everyone loved her for no apparent reason.  That really irked me.
0756405890|5.0|There's a lot not to like about this book.  It reads quite a bit like Wizard of Earthsea.  The author admits to several late additions which are of dubious value (including the famous \\"Blue Wedding\\" scene).  And many read this book with the promise that the sequel would be forthcoming within a year.<br /><br />That didn't happen.  We are still waiting for the second book, several years later.  And I think Rothfuss's editors do him no favors.<br /><br />But this is one of the rare books that I found it impossible to put down.  I read it in one day, staying up to nearly 5 am, knowing I had to work at 8 the next morning and unable to stop reading.  I don't think Kvothe is a particularly interesting character and his Harry Potter-like adventures hardly seem inspired, but Rothfuss is such an exceptional writer that everything he does just works.<br /><br />This is a book I'd recommend to anyone who likes good stories....I just wish his publishers had let him publish a leaner, more focused tale.
B000025XKM|4.0|\\"Pink Moon\\" was the third and last album that Nick Drake managed to get released in his all too short lifetime. The album differs somewhat from the previous two; first and foremost through the fact that the songs are only accompanied by Drake himself on his acoustic guitar, apart from the title track which has a nice little piano line also played by Drake.<br /><br />The songs are generally simple and short, and in some cases they may seem a little unfinished, with only one verse and a slightly raw sound on the guitar. Drake's well known and strong songwriting is present on most tracks, and when a first disappointment may have subsided, you will discover several fine songs on a par with Drake's very best.<br /><br />The title track \\"Pink Moon\\" is perhaps the easiest to tune to fall for; a very melodic and catchy song, ywhich you may easily find yourself go humming. A nice variation with the nice piano-part.<br /><br />There is as of the first two albums a sad undertone to most songs. This applies not least \\"Place to Be\\", one of the few songs with longer lyrics. \\"Road\\" is a nice little song that could well sound like a Donovan song. \\"Which Will\\" is also a song that wins on closer acquaintance, while  \\"Horn\\" is a nice little instrumental which showcases  Drake's original guitar style.<br /><br />\\"Things Behind the Sun\\" is another of the album highlights; a song which seems completely finished, unlike the next track \\"Know\\", which in both sound and form appears rather unfinished - a little bluesy thing.<br /><br />The sad mood get an extra shot with \\"Parasite\\" also one of the most memorable songs. \\"Free Ride\\" may also appear a little unfinished but still quite charming Another fine Donovan-like song.b\\"Harvest Breed\\" is a very short little song with just a single verse - it has a fine typical Drake melody.<br /><br />\\"From the Morning\\" is a worthy end to a nice little album which may nevertheless appear somewhat unresolved, and one can easily come to feel that the album could have deserved a little more time in the creation process and maybe a little variation in the arrangements.

B000002LR6|5.0|I always laugh at reviews of bands \\" swan song \\" or best albums, cds, whatever. The pretension is as knee deep as pig crap. The time was right for Ministry to make their best cd. And they did. This is very good stuff. Good enough for mainstream consumers to listen to without getting too rattled. Yes its \\"heavy\\" \\"punchy\\" \\"raw\\" and slick and dark and groundbreaking and all those words. It made lots of money. It wont make as much now cuz you can get it for free if you look. But i recomend you buy it because i had to when it came out. Ok, was that review obscure and angry enough to make me alternative hip sheek cool punk ?
B0041CGP02|5.0|Led Zeppelin. Rolling Stones. Beatles. Bon Jovi.    Bon Jovi's music has become timeless. They are legends.    I highly recommend this, their \\"Ultimate Collection-Greatest Hits\\". Get the two disc set.    The one constant about Bon Jovi is that they are consistent. You know what you're getting when you get a Bon Jovi album-great music, great lyrics, great inspiration.    Their songs are songs of brotherhood, love, hope, loyalty and believing in your dreams.    They are one of the greatest rock bands in history. You dont last over 25 years and have your latest albums go #1 without being a great rock band (and having loyal fans helps, too)    The four brand new songs on this two disc set should be on the NEXT greatest hits album 15 years from now. The New song \\"What do you got?\\" is great. The New Song \\"This is love, this is life\\"....try NOT to sing along with it.    The new song \\"No apologies\\" is a very different sounding song, by Bon Jovi standards, but it is great.    The new song \\"The more things change\\" is a typical Bon Jovi song, and if you enjoyed \\"The Circle\\" album, you'll love it. It's a great song.    I'll let the classic songs, \\"Blood On Blood\\", \\"Born To Be My Baby\\", \\"Livin On A Prayer\\", \\"Keep The Faith\\", \\"Always\\", etc. etc. speak for themselves.    If there is one thing I would change about this set it is the decision to shorten \\"Lay Your Hands On Me\\". I understand that they wanted the songs to remain smooth, rockin, and quick, but they should have left the song the way it was.    Also, \\"In and Out of Love\\" or \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" should have been on the album rather than \\"When We Were Beautiful\\",\\"In These Arms\\" and \\"Lost Highway\\" which werent really hit songs.    But, all in all, this is a fantastic collection. The Best of the best. Why are Bon Jovi one of the greatest rock bands of all time? Listen to this album, and you'll have your answer.
0143034901|5.0|Though this book came recommended, I worried that it might reek of the pseudo-spirituality of something like the Alchemist. Or that the story might be dull as that of something like the Historian. The beginning is indeed a little slow, which might put off some readers.<br /><br />But though this book received a lot of praise, it might not have received enough.  It's one of the very best of the decade; a story involving every emotion and told from a master wordsmith.  There aren't enough superlatives to describe this book; it's one of the few I've ever been genuinely sorry to finish.
B003U0AHBO|3.0|This movie is entertaining but it is not one of Crowe's best and the film itself is a poor man's \\"Gladiator.\\"  I had to laugh when the French forces landed in thinly desguised Higgins WW II landing craft.  All and all it is a decent film.  Slow in spots (to a dead crawl), but if you are a Russel Crowe fan like me you have to add it to your collection.  Personally \\"LA Confidential\\" was much more enjoyable.
B0044IJ1S6|1.0|How can a Blu-ray image look this poor?  Significant jpeg artifacts mar virtually every scene involving color gradients (and in a concert scenario, theatrical lighting creates colored gradients constantly).  Just as bad, Dave Gahan's voice is severely strained and frankly painful to hear.  Martin Gore, on the other hand, is in top form, and his performances are worth seeing by any Depeche Mode fan.  The concert as a whole, however, is tremendously disappointing.  Overall, the audio quality of the concert sounds like something recorded off a vintage AM radio.  The filming and editing are also quite poor.  Minute after minute of footage showcases audience members holding up their camera phones (instead of the band performing, as if strangers' cameras were of more interest than Depeche Mode themselves).  Be aware of inexplicable blurred close-ups of random things as if a poorly trained monkey were directing the photography.  Considering the technology and talent available for this release, the image and sound quality are embarrassingly unacceptable.  Dave's strained vocal chords are forgivable, yet the band should have chosen a night he was feeling fresh and strong to record their concert for posterity.  It's a shameful package all around.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Sherlock Holmes has always been one of my favorite characters.

B0034G4OZE|5.0|The movie should be called \\"It's Kind of an Amazing Movie\\". When you go see a Zach Galifianakis movie, you don't expect anything more than a stupid comedy (that has potential to be good), but \\"It's Kind of a Funny Story\\" was way better than the exceptions I had. The movie was funny, intense, and some-what depressing/sad. The movie makes you think about life. The movie makes you think about how lucky you are or realize the good things in life. This movie is a must see. It is truly amazing and probably one of the best movies of 2010 so far.
159102594X|3.0|This is a frustrating book, because it could have been the entertaining romp intended by the author.  But his writing is more lazy than focused, and entirely too self-indulgent.  The characters were painfully flawed but still far from realistic.  This is one of the rare trilogies where I couldn't be bothered to read the final volume.  I wouldn't recommend this even to fans of spec fic.
B003W5C0VW|4.0|There's no doubt in anyone's mind that the Stones during the Taylor era were at the top of their game. Despite the fact that he did not write any of their music, Taylor's exquisite guitar playing to complement Keith's great foundation playing, the musicianship took precedence over the theatrics and Jagger's \\"one man show\\" performance.of the latter Stones. The big gripe I have (I knew it would happen) is the lower volume of Taylor's guitar where you almost have to strain to hear all the details and nuances. Unlike a bootleg cd I have from the same era recorded in Europe, where the master's guitar is loud and up front where it belongs. After all these years of professional jealously, give it a rest Keith. Let the fans enjoy the Stones before they became a caricature of their former selves.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I am blown away by this album. I wasn't sure what exactly to expect when I bought it, but it kept popping up on all the \\"also viewed\\" categories while I was seeking new music, so I decided to jump in and check it out. Man oh man am I glad I did. This CD blew me away from the very beginning. I found myself unable to sit still the first time through with this album, and it has just gotten better with each listen. Folk rock is the best category to describe this band, but then they really can't be pigeonholed that easily either as every song has a somewhat different feel to it. One song will have a bluegrass-Irish-tinged feel to it and the next song will be a melancholy acoustic jam with moments of raucous and sudden outbursts of instruments. Then the next song will be a tense cacophony of sound with a reverberating violin in the background holding everything together. I've never heard anything quite like this band, and I cannot wait to see what they do with their sophomore album. I promise I will be buying that one the day it is released.     Incidentally, I've read up on this band since buying their release and they have a reputation of putting on some energetic shows. Apparently, all the members are very accomplished and varied musicians, and they often trade instruments during sets just for the fun of it. Hopefully they will become popular enough to tour the States sometime soon. I will be there if and when they do.
B000BNX3AU|5.0|John Cusack is such a \\"good guy\\" in this movie.  I actually laughed out loud during the race around town to the drug stores!  Diane Lane's interaction with her family is a hoot!
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Ridley Scott comes with a certain expectation, of sumptuous cinematography and attention to detail.. and this movie does not disappoint.  Particularly in the extended version which just makes more sense than the theatrical version.  I feel part of the movies disappointment first time round in theatres, was due to a measure of mis-marketing.  This is not a Robin Hood movie as such - this is a precursor, a prequel of sorts - an origin story that reimagines how such stories and myths could come about.  Gone are the men in tights, gone is the jaunty humour, no more the scenes of robbing the wealthy and paying back the poor as a set up for the character.  In is a historical context, a history which reaches far beyond Nottingham, and large battle scenes.  Indeed, the addition of a huge D-Day style battle at the climax feels rather too over the top, and as well photographed and executed as it is, feels like a betrayal of the build up rather than a necessary dramatic high to end the movie.  The movie starts with a myth busting moment - an accurate recreation of King Richard dying at the hands of the French (and a cook, at that..), which sets Robin Longstride (soon to become Robin of the Hood) off on a journey with a band of (not so merry) men, back home.  At first, they are out to save their own skin and maybe accrue some wealth to ensure their future- and gradually, involved in a more altruistic fight, to quell a French plot to ignite the Baron's War.  The history after Richard's death is somewhat muddled, and liberally draws on events which occurred over a longer period and shuffles them around to fit this new version of history.  So we get the Magna Carta introduced years before it came about, a French invasion which never happened - or at least, not in a massive battle like this, and the Baron's war happening much earlier than it did.  But putting that to the side, this is quite a compelling and imaginative story of the character, and has ambitious scope, worthy actingand as we expect from Scott, well shot throughout.  Where we are let down, is the tagged on `big battle scene' and the excised humour.  Even real life has more smiles than this joyless exercise.  The deleted scenes give some clue that perhaps more humour was originally intended.. but as Roger Ebert suggested, it does rather make you pine for the smiling and happy Errol Flynn to carry off the darker moments with a bit more pizzazz.  Special mention should go to Mark Strong as the treacherous Godfrey, and Oscar Isaac as Prince (and King) John.. they at least uphold the tradition of the villain being entertaining.  As for the extended version - yes, it's long.  Too long, perhaps - but its significantly better than the theatrical version.  Included now are scenes which flesh out the burgeoning relationship between Robin and Marion, particularly the scenes involving the orphans running ferile in the forest, to whom they both try and reach out.  The background to Robin Longstride remembering his past and its significance is also much clearer here, with the addition of just a few short moments.    All in all, what was *** in the theatre has become a **** movie in this version - but still lacks the resolution and soupcon of humour that would have made it *****.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|The ArchAndroid, by Janelle Monae, is probably (without a hesitation) one of the best albums of 2010.<br />How would I describe it to someone who has never heard Monae before? Most people are most familiar with \\"Tightrope (featuring Big Boi).\\"<br />That song, for me, is quasi James Brown and quasi Martha and the Vandellas. Janelle has the kind of voice that lingers in your ears like beautiful, sweet and imaginative audio velvet.<br /><br />Monae has an uncanny knack for penning (and co-penning songs) with catchy hooks, imaginative content and juxtapositions of classical music, P - Funk (elements lifted from Prince & The New Power Generation), dance beats, and folk interludes. It is hard to really single out one song, in particular, that best embodies what I am trying to depict in this review. The album takes place sometime in the far off future in a sort of mental institution for the brilliant and the insane - The Palace of the Dogs. Every song is inspired to some magical artistic element or artist that inspires Monae. An example would be \\"Tightrope\\" which is inspired by James Brown's cape (among others inspirations). Monae is wise beyond her years (she is in her mid twenties). Not only is she drop dead gorgeous, but she has the ability to transcend genres, languages (I think I heard some Spanish faintly spoken in some tracks in the background), and lyrical \\"limitations\\" (which is an illusion - there are none when an artist continues to challenge them).  A prediction for 2011?  This young woman will be walking home with many Grammy Awards.
B0018CWEZ8|3.0|The first 3 seasons of LOST kept me riveted.  It was an excellent series . . . until . . .<br /><br />Until they turned the island into something more sci fi than survival. The whole series took a turn for the worst in season 4.  I'm just not buying into the whole time travel, time looping, twisting,turning saga. I truly truly almost feel sorry for the serious actors of this series, because after listening to the bonus commentaries etc, you just have to know that they didn't know from the beginning that the series was going to become so nonsensical.  Making an island disappear  or \\"move\\" is just ummm STUPID.  Beyond that even, season 5 defies all human reason and is worse than Season 4.  I have no doubt that it's difficult to write a logical survival type program for 4 to 5 years, but GEEZ LOUISE, please don't assault the intelligence of your viewers THAT OFTEN and still expect them to watch your program!!!!!  Needless to say, the sci fi time travel angle was OVERDONE!  I'll still buy Season 6 just because I can, and because I now own all the others, but that is the only reason.

I'm a big fan of the show so, and I know most people are, so it's a hard act to \\"follow\\". The books came first, but honestly, how many of us had heard of them before the show?

0439023513|4.0|I finished Mockingjay a few days ago.  At first, I was not sure how I felt about the way things ended.  I'm not one for the endless chapters outlining a character's depression - simply because I find it boring.  I KNOW it is realistic, I KNOW it is a part of life, especially for a veteran or an active in war...I just get bored and don't care past a certain point.  FYI - there is a LOT of that inner turmoil monologue going on in Mockingjay.    That said:    I was captured by the characterization in this book just as I was in it's predecessors.  I wanted to know what would happen to them.  I wanted to see what depths the Capitol and Snow would sink to in the pursuit of victory.  I wanted to see if and how Katniss would cripple the Capitol and stop the Hunger Games forever.  That is what I wanted.  Well...that is what I THOUGHT I wanted.    A few days separated from Katniss and the Districts and the Capitol are exactly what I needed to figure out why I was so confused about my feelings toward Mockingjay.  You see, the thing that first captured me after I stumbled upon The Hunger Games (quite by accident, not knowing it was such a sensation at the time) was...well, the HUNGER GAMES.  As funny and maybe ironic as it might be, the most interesting part of this story was the Games themselves.  The provocative question: What does a child become when they are forcibly recruited into a very adult and real fight for their life? - that is the real masterpiece of this story.  I, like the people of the Capitol, enjoyed the Games themselves because they were entertaining. Morally, I was outraged by the idea of tithing two children from each district as a symbolic sacrifice and show of power.  I wanted the rebels to rise up and stop the injustice.  But, in a confusing turn of events, I got exactly what I thought I wanted - and was totally thrown off guard to find that the magic of Panem WAS the Hunger Games and without them the story, unfortunately, left a little to be desired.The thing of it is, Katniss THRIVED unexpectedly inside the first arena - and came out victorious on not only one, but two accounts.  In the second arena she began to realize and OWN the influence she was having as the famous girl on fire.  Then, in Mockingjay...she fell apart.  She was saved and medicated and back in the loving arms of her family (granted she didn't love District 13, but at least she hadn't burnt to death in 12 or died uselessly in the abandoned 75th Hunger Games)but she fell down into this well of self pity and admonishment that went on and on.  What was the missing element?  What was the condition that forced her into greatness time and again?  The arena was missing.   Collins tried to make team 451 into tributes and the warzone into a kind of arena, but the surprises, the cleverness, the buzz of the actual game was missing.  Then, in the final hour, just as she was surging up and regaining some of that Katniss Everdeen inspiration - the unthinkable happens.  The whole catalyst for her entering the games is taken out in one insignificant moment.  The one thing she was always fighting for - ripped from her, rendering her entire sacrifice useless.     I know innocent people die in war.  I know keeping every important person alive isn't realistic. Contrary to those who feel that they are more \\"literate\\" because the just LOVED it, I wanted certain people alive at the end.  I wanted certain families to be reunited at the end.  I am human, and I was completely blindsided by one specific death and the way Katniss was treated after she punished the person who was (surprisingly) to blame.  And all this, on top of the fact that there was no arena...I was disenchanted.    You may ask yourself, \\"Self, why then, did she give it four stars?\\"  Well, to tell the truth, even as confused as I felt and as much as some things didn't go my way, there was something about the ending that stuck with me.  The last line, to be precise, was worth getting through the whole thing.  And, as is the mark of any good series, the moment I closed the last book, I wanted to reopen the first one and start from the beginning all over again.  And, let's face it, one day I probably will do just that. The four stars are given because that is my feeling about the series overall.  The Hunger Games, books 1, 2, and 3 deserve a high rating because the whole thing together is superb.    Conclusion: Should you read it?  Well, if you've gotten to the third book you NEED to finish and make up your own mind. Was it good?  Yes.  My ideal?  No. Somewhat satisfying? Somewhat, yes and somewhat no.  Do I regret reading it?  Absolutely no.    Read it.  Take away your own conclusions and know before you start that you are reading a story about war.  War is not kind or fair. War is not a game. And especially in the case of the Capitol of Panem, war most definitely does NOT spare the rod and spoil the child.
B002ZG99TA|3.0|Remember Speed from 1994? It was that action film that everyone seemed to love during the nineties and for good reason; it had high octane action, a great cast, and it managed to just keep going even when you thought it was going to end like ten minutes prior. Now get rid of the bus and replace it with an out of control train carrying explosive chemicals. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are now Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, which means Joe Morton is now Rosario Dawson and Dennis Hopper is Kevin Dunn...or something. Anyway, the point is, Unstoppable in a nutshell is basically Speed on a train.<br /><br />The first thing that comes to mind with Unstoppable is how incredibly LOUD it is. It seemed like the knob to the volume was broken off after it was turned past its limitations during the sound editing process. If you aren't listening to an out of control train squealing on railroad tracks, it's the soundtrack full of heavy guitar riffs that rumbles the floor under your seat. The other kind of bizarre thing was the weird zoom-in Unstoppable used in the first half of the film. We'd open on a shot of actors talking, but then the camera would zoom-in slightly sometimes more than once. It was probably used to try and add suspense to whatever the actors were talking about at the time, but it came off as irritating more than anything. Thankfully, it wasn't done the entire film. I seem to remember it happening during another recent film that I can't put my finger on, but it's more than likely another Tony Scott film.<br /><br />In a film like this, acting is kind of secondary. As long as they're reacting to whatever threat is currently posed against them in a way that seems realistic, then it's safe to say that they've done their job well. This isn't the best work of any of the actors involved. Denzel Washington definitely shined brighter in both Man on Fire (another Tony Scott film) and The Book of Eli from earlier this year and Chris Pine hasn't really done anything as impressive as his portrayal of Captain James Kirk in last year's Star Trek. Then there's Rosario Dawson whose role as Connie seems kind of safe for the actress as it seems way too similiar to most of the other roles in her repertoire. The thing is though that it all works out in the end to deliver a film that is both thrilling and exciting. People go to the movies to be entertained and this film does that very well. The one problem with Unstoppable is that it doesn't seem to give any weight to the several emotional factors of the film. We know just enough to realize both Frank and Will will lose a lot if they fail at trying to stop this train and while it does work, I can't help but feel like the film would have had an even bigger impact if we had spent a little more time getting to know Frank's daughters or having a little more depth to Will's situation with his wife and son.<br /><br />Unstoppable is a white knuckled, edge of your seat thriller that has a way of making you feel like you're thrown in front of the railroad tracks as this unstoppable train approaches during the most suspenseful and knuckle biting scenes. The thriller is very similar to what Speed would be like today if it took place on a train, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Unstoppable is definitely an exciting way to waste an hour and a half.is portrayal of Captain James Kirk in last year's Star Trek.

The one problem with Unstoppable is that it doesn't seem to give any weight to the several emotional factors of the film. We know just enough to realize both Frank and Will will lose a lot if they fail at trying to stop this train and while it does work, I can't help but feel like the film would have had an even bigger impact if we had spent a little more time getting to know Frank's daughters or having a little more depth to Will's situation with his wife and son.    Unstoppable is a white knuckled, edge of your seat thriller that has a way of making you feel like you're thrown in front of the railroad tracks as this unstoppable train approaches during the most suspenseful and knuckle biting scenes. The thriller is very similar to what Speed would be like today if it took place on a train, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Unstoppable is definitely an exciting way to waste an hour and a half.

1416594795|5.0|This was a very good book. For the most part it already told me what I knew beforehand, but there was new information included as well. In one of the chapters Dawkins talked about the tortoise and how its evolutionary history is that of an animal that went from water to dry land then back to water only to turn around and return to land.    If you love biology then I recommend this book. If you are unsure about evolution because you do not know of the evidence then YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!. I am thrilled to have it in my library. :Ð
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|I can honestly say I felt this was some of Joe's best music in a long time. With him you come to expect the fretboard wizardry. And he certainly delivers, as always. But honestly, as much as I enjoyed his last few albums (Super Colossal & Professor Satchifunkilus), I didn't think he was reaching out as much when it came to interesting song ideas.     Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards though, did just that. He had several standard hard rockers, but also had a number of songs variously different from the normal Satch. They included gospel sounding, jazzy, & Eastern songs and even one where he works with an auto-tuner, which comes out amazingly cool-sounding.     Whichever style he dabbled in on this one though, my favorite part of the whole album was how the whole band really seemed to come together. The bass and drums seemed to flow more than his later releases, similar to how they did on Crystal Planet or his self-titled. Mike Keneally on keys was also a HUGE boost to the sound throughout the whole thing. Particularly on Wormhole Wizards and Wind in the Trees, which was not only arguably the best song on the cd, but also has made a case for possibly my favorite Joe song ever.     Bottom line, whether you love Joe already or have just now heard about him and want to check him out, get this cd IMMEDIATELY. You will not regret it.
1594484813|3.0|This book suffers from a dichotomy of subjects. On one hand you get to explore the intriguing world of rare books filled with mysterious bookstores, tales of obsession and fanatical bibliophiles. On the other hand the book follows the exploits of a Gilkey who, as the story goes on, feels more and more like a two-bit con artist who happens to like books and so steals them. It's hard not to come to the same conclusion as one of the book sellers who accuses Bartlett of glorifying him. Bartlett tries to justify her actions as she participates in quasi-illegal activities with Gilkey, but in the end it seems she's conned herself into thinking that what she did is ethical and worthwhile since she was \\"writing about crime.\\" She writes about Gilkey's selfishness in ignoring the damage he does to other people with his exploits, yet ignores her own selfishness in glorifying Gilkey for profit. She even seems to admire him at the end, describing him as a \\"happy man, with goals, ambition, and some measure of success\\" and describing her time with him as sometimes \\"even pleasurable.\\"    Worse, Gilkey takes up more and more space as the book progresses, distracting from the vastly more intriguing world of rare books. It drags the book down since he's really not that interesting a character. We get to visit Gilkey's childhood bedroom which has a lot of books in it and (gasp!) some ceramic frogs. Or we get to listen to his musings on creating literary bobble heads or writing some detective novels. Bartlett tries to punch up the sagging story with liberal uses of words like epiphany, astounded, urgent, stunned. The height of her hyperbole is when she describes Gilkey's fairly innocent-sounding childhood bedroom as \\"a ghastly scar, something awful but riveting.\\"    Near the end of the book, Bartlett writes about a nineteenth-century Spanish monk who killed nine people to obtain one unique book, only to find that there was another copy of it in existence. I found myself thinking at the end of this book that that tale would have made a much better story.
B0030E1XJU|4.0|This has been exactly how we imagined when we bought it.  Very durable, and a fun concept too.  It is neat that it can be added to other sets, and you can make a whole series of chain reactions, so it teaches planning in play, which is nice.  If  you just wanted to set up a playground scenario for your toys, than it can be played this way too.  Highly recommend.

B000MXPE7O|4.0|DeNiro proves he can a direct an epic tale.  This one for the highly prolific actor is only his second credit as a director, the first \\"A Bronx Tale\\" was small but still highly watchable.  Francis Ford Copolla is one of the producers and this comes closed of being The Godfather as CIA boss.  Matt Damon who's in every scene, underplays everything which adds both to a slower pace and others to act out more.<br /><br />In spite of billing, John Turturro is Damon's true co-star here, having a standout scene in an interrogative sequence with Russian spy. Angelina  Jolie is quite bewitching at the beginning and acts old well as narrative takes place in twenty years, from the outbreak of World War Two to the Bay of Pigs.  Mr. DeNiro's scenes are quite brief and he even gives old co-star Joe Pesci one great scene.<br /><br />The real focus though is that of a spy thriller, different than the Jason Bourne movies that Damon has done.  I did enjoy the intrigue and how William Hurt's character gets put down.  Made the same year Martin Scorsese's Oscar winning The Departed, this is a good companion to it,.
B0044E9LW6|5.0|First off, I still can't believe he's gone. I was so looking forward to more tunage from the Heaven & Hell lads down the road, however with Ronnie's passing that's obviously not going to happen. In my lifetime their have been three musician's who's deaths have left me feeling like a part of me had died as well. Call it a void or whatever, their passing left me feeling empty for lack of a better word. Those musician's are John Bonham, Freddie Mercury and now Ronnie James Dio. All of them were a big part of my life at some point and time as I've followed their careers for as long as I can remember. With their passing I felt as though I had lost a brother or a good friend. I guess in many ways that's what they were for a lot of us as most of us grew up with them. I saw Dio twice, once with his own band opening up for Maiden in Toronto Canada and once with Heaven & Hell about two years or so ago in Ottawa Canada. Both shows were great and will always bring a smile to my face. They say music never dies and that may be true, however these guys were more than just music to me, they were my youth and my friends!<br /><br />As for this release itself, well if you loved the man and his music, you'll love this release. Pretty well all of the early stuff's on here, which was his best tunage as far as I'm concerned. The songs are great, but the dynamics are a little compressed and thus the result is a cd that sounds a tad flat. It's not a very open sounding cd. Some of the tunes listed are just melodies and not the full monty so to speak, but it works overall. For the price and for the memories, it's well worth the cash.<br /><br />R.I.P. Ronnie, we'll miss you!

If you are of that 40 something age group and grew up loving rock 'n roll - you won't be able to resist this timeless nostaglia.

B000M4RG42|4.0|Facts are revealed behind the famous photo of soldiers raising the American flag in Iwo Jima not generally known.  This is also a good expose of military marketing as the three survivors got literally paraded around football stadiums.  Standout performance of Adam Beach, the native American who deeply troubled by the ordeal.  Best seen with Letters from Iwo Jima and considered this one of director Clint Eastwood's best work.    Somewhat more workman are the performances of Ryan Phillipe and Jesse Stanford.  Phillip's character doesn't ask for much and knows there's nothing glorious about being in a war.  Stanford's character saw the media tour as a possible business opportunity.  Eastwood's music adds to the sour elegance to the whole proceedings.    The opening sequences are very good and strongly suspect it's co-producer Steilberg's main contribution.  Eastwood is one Westerner who has given good portrayals of the native Americans.  The Outlaw Josie Whales that he starred and directed only shows the killing of whites.  As remarked by many, he's grown since then.

0811875555|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3SHFLTLES9MAZ]]This is a very beautiful book for Disney's 50th feature film, Tangled, which is also the first 3D computer-animated fairy tale for them.<br /><br />The 160-page hardcover is filled with the very distinctive Disney style art, featuring character designs, environment and storyboards.<br /><br />I love the beautiful character sketches and there are lots of them. Some of the character artists are Jin Kim, Claire Keane, Bill Schwab who drew really expressive characters. But much of them are drawn by legendary animator Glen Keane, and they really stand out with their lively action poses. It's fun to see the many expressions and tricks Rapunzel can do with her 70-feet hair. Other than Rapunzel, there are sketches for Flynn Rider (prince), Pascal (chameleon), Maximus (horse) and other characters like the bad guys.<br /><br />As for the environment art, you'll get to see the familiar Disney towns and castles as interpreted by artists today. The design inspiration comes from previous Disney films like Cinderella, Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty. Some of the paintings from those films are also included. It's about translating what used to be 2D into 3D and you can read all about the challenges from the artists' interviews.<br /><br />The change in medium for creating Tangled makes it feel like a totally fresh Disney fairy tale, yet it also feels like the older ones at the same time. It continues Disney's legacy in animation in a fine way.<br /><br />This book is a treat to artists, animators and art lovers. A lot of great artists contributed to the art and unfortunately I can't name them all so you'll have to get the book to check out their work.<br /><br />-<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B004124VG2|4.0|Just an FYI: \\"Impossible Soul\\" is shortened about 3 minutes on the vinyl version, with the sweet, acoustic ending of the song completely absent. This is presumably due to the constraints of vinyl (though classical albums seem to fit 30 minutes on a side easily!), but it does ruin the flow of that very sweet song, which comes full circle in the end. Doesn't matter much to me; I'd still want the vinyl version, but I post this comment in case it makes a difference to any of you. [[ASIN:B004124VG2 Age of Adz (2xLP)]]
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|For me, this record by Eric shows his talent and sheer musical genius for picking songs that fit his age and ability. In particular, I like \\"My Very Good Friend The Milkman\\", \\"How Deep...\\", \\"When Somebody Thinks Your Wonderful\\". The arrangements are very sublime and understated. Granted, there are no moments of him wailing away, blasting thru blues choruses, up to 11. But that's OK with me. If I want that side, I'll pull out some other albums from his massive catalog or catch some youtube performances. This one will grow on you, I like it while driving because it has a cozy feel, not tense. It's Easy Listening but that's not a putdown. Your ears and blood pressure will thank you. Enjoy.

B0040HJNKC|5.0|Ever since Buddy revitalized his recording career with 1991's [[ASIN:B0007VBF24 Damn Right, I've Got the Blues (Expanded Edition)]], music lovers have been treated to one live grenade after another. The latest, \\"Living Proof,\\" shows that Buddy isn't slowing down, he's only getting better and better. The opener, \\"74 Years Young,\\" starts off seductively with just Buddy and his acoustic guitar. He's teasing, he's motioning you toward the place where he's coiled in the grass like the king of all crawling kingsnakes, and at the 3 minute mark, BLAM...shock & awe, Buddy in full electric mode, shredding everything in his path. I can see that grin, that big ear-to-ear expression of joy that Buddy gets when he knows he's got you right where he wants you.    Life is good. Buddy's back with a new album that should equally inspire and terrify every guitarist on the planet.    The next track, \\"Thank Me Someday,\\" stomps and lumbers along in glorious Muddy mode, in the style of \\"Rolling Stone\\" and \\"Two Trains Coming.\\" Is that a red house over yonder? Buddy yells \\"LISTEN! LISTEN TO ME\\" as he effortlessly peels the paint from the walls with a slow solo that morphs into an a rapid-fire whirlwind of arpeggios. Damn RIGHT he's got the blues.    \\"On The Road\\" is a laid-back shuffle that is reminiscent of Albert King and the Clapton-Green-Taylor era of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, but it's still pure Buddy. Two and a half minutes, there's the solo...we're only up to the third track and Buddy has already delivered 300% of your minimum daily requirement of mind-numbing, awe-inspiring blues guitar solos.    \\"Stay Around A Little Longer\\"...Buddy's duet with B.B. King...is a blues ballad, nice and relaxed, with an easy-going give and take of verses and solos.     \\"Key Don't Fit\\" is another thump-and-sting slow blues, back into heavy-duty soloing territory. The title track channels the Mick Taylor / Keith Richards blues of [[ASIN:B0039TD7RC Exile on Main Street]], then kicks it up a few notches.     \\"Where The Blues Begins\\" (with Carlos Santana) is another slow one, a \\"back down in the alley\\" blues that is a bot more restrained than the songs that have preceded it.    \\"Everybody's Got To Go\\" is a ballad, with sweet \\"ooooh\\" background vocals and a swirling organ that's right out of the Shelter Records albums Freddie King made with Leon Russell's crew.    \\"Let The Door Knob Hit Ya\\" is in the spirit of \\"Damn Right I've Got The Blues\\"...\\"Don't let the door hit ya where my damn dog should have bit ya\\"...more solos, another \\"stone crazy\\" track from Buddy.    \\"Guess What\\" is slow and deadly, and almost half of the track consists of soloing. Buddy closes out the album with \\"Skanky,\\" a 4-minute instrumental for those of you in the audience who didn't get enough soloing in the previous 49 minutes.    You say you want a GREAT Buddy Guy album, one where the guitar takes center stage and he howls like a madman? This would be that album. One of the best albums of 2010, and one of the best in Buddy's career. Don't stop here, Buddy...keep 'em coming.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|As an author (Ruth Logan Herne) and a country music lover, rarely do I get the chance to hear continued poignancy and depth from a group, singer, or song-writer. Lady Antebellum embraces all three with a combination of great music layering and building, employing a hard-to-pinpoint but wonderful to hear realism with lyrical grace.    Their Hello, World stacks up against Need You Now as a prime example of how lyricism and musical notes can build or soften a story, taking the listener on a delightful roller coaster ride of deep emotions. The majesty and talent of being able to do this is what sets them apart so often. I love that they're unafraid to change lead singers as the song requires, a mark of true self-confidence, well-deserved.    Well done, Lady A, and congratulations from this author on those well-deserved awards at the CMA's.  Excellent.

0143118420|1.0|I cannot express my disapointment in such a talked-about, popular(?) book/movie.  I get the whole 'finding-yourself-after-divorce' and 'connecting-with-a-higher-spirit' stuff.  I really do.  I even enjoyed the travel aspect.  I love hearing first-hand experiences from those who've lived in other cultures.  It would have been great to write a book just about that.  However, this book seems to be the most narcissistic, whiny drivel to hit the book shelf in quite some time.  Come on already.  Build a bridge and get over it lady.  She devastated her husband by revealing that everything she'd told him thus far in their relationship was, in face, not true, like a cosmic-sized my bad. Instead of being overwhelmed with guilt for tearing apart his life (as well as the boyfriend she dates and devastates before she's actually divorced) she goes on and on (and on) about how hard it was...for her. At no time did I read that she realized the mistakes she made, felt remorse for, and thusly learned from, in her relationships with these two men. THAT would signify spiritual growth.  News flash:  In the real world, we (women, men, whatever) are rarely, if ever, afforded the luxury of focusing soley on OUR feelings about individual circumstances for 2-3 years.  Life doesn't work that way.  Life is hard.  Life is not fair.  Who the hell are you to think you should be excluded from that particular game plan?!  Instead of spending considerable time and money, let alone the effort and energy, 'finding yourself' in an ashram, etc., why not spend that time living for others?  Build a house, build a school, help out in an orphanage.  You can do all these things in this country as well as all but a few others.  It seems that you would have found 'your peace/soul/serenity/quietness/divine/light/purpose/destiny' just as soon, if not sooner, living a grateful life of service in any aspect.  How many things could have been accomplished (i.e. deposited in your bank-0-kharma) had you chosen to skipthe over-indulgent focus on self?    I'm glad it worked for her.  Really I am.  I just wanted to gag every time she brought up HER anger, HER lonliness, HER hurt.  That's called the pity-pot and most people don't have the time or money to spend more than a few hours there, and are all the better for it. If we're blessed, someone in our lives tells us to get over it and, yeah, it sucks, but let's all move on now. It's natural, I think, to feel that way at some point in our life.  It isn't natural, however, to perseverate on ourselves to the degree described in this book.    I also wanted to slap someone when she went on and on about the 'evils' of modern medication.  REAL people with real families and jobs and committments also cannot afford the luxury of taking weeks/months/years to remedy a condition of mild to severe depression.  No one thing is the answer, but medication has helped millions of people continue to live more sane and productive lives.  It should always be taken in conjunction with therapy or counseling, but not everyone is able to do that.  From reading this book, I was definitely under the impression that she could have benefitted greatly from the right medication in the right dose.  I am deeply disturbed by the thought that other women would read this book and feel justified to go 'find themselves' at the expense of spouses, children and any of their loved ones.  It is up to each of us to live up to our potential.  Isn't there any room for some common sense and true love and compassion in doing it?  Not only do I believe there is, but I truly believe that the example we set in doing what is right at the same time we're serving others and/or 'finding ourselves' is just as, if not more, important.  Ok. I'm done now.  Thank you, drively safely and have a good night.

0061537969|5.0|Wow -- what an emotional wallop!  Even as a football-watching, beer-drinking, dude-lit-reading, red-blooded American male, I say the following without an ounce of sarcasm: Garth Stein's The Art of Racing in the Rain is one of the sweetest, most heart-wrenching stories I've read in a long time. I haven't been that near to bawling my eyes out while reading a book since I was like nine years old!<br /><br />You've heard about this book, right? It's narrated by dog named Enzo. Enzo is annoyed that he doesn't have thumbs and can't talk, but comforts himself with the notion that in his next life, he'll be human. In fact, he feels like he's ready to be human now. (He also thinks that the domestication of dogs was a conspiracy by humans to prevent them from evolving further. If I were a dog, I'd buy that for sure!)<br /><br />Enzo lives with Denny, an amateur race car driver, Denny's wife Eve and daughter Zoe. Life is good for awhile. But then it's not. Eve gets sick. Her parents meddle. And increasingly bad things happen. But Enzo sticks by Denny's side, both as a companion and a voice (so to speak) of reason.<br /><br />Enzo is a dog, to be sure, so there is much he doesn't understand. But what he does, what he's learned from Denny, is that race car driving can be a metaphor for life. And so, the lessons learned on the track are just as applicable when the dog poo hits the fan in real life. Denny explains that the key to racing in the rain is to remember that \\"that which we manifest is before us.\\" A driver must be proactive because what he initiates, he can control. What he reacts to, he can't. So, too, in life. And as things get increasingly worse for Denny, he's tempted to give in and quit fighting. But it's Enzo's companionship that carries him forward. Denny is an incredibly admirable protagonist, and you root really, really hard for a happy ending. You root so hard, in fact, you're willing to suspend disbelief quite a bit for a few parts (of course, other than the fact that a dog is telling us the story).<br /><br />This is a must-read for any dog-lover. But if you're a crier, keep the tissues nearby. It's a quick, frenzied read. It's simple, but intellectually engaging. It's funny, but often very sad, too. I really liked it!us the story).

B000002OVJ|5.0|Expanded to 14 songs from the original six, The Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\" is a great album made even greater.  It has been 40 years since The Who played their concert at the Refectory of the University of Leeds on Saint Valentine's Day 1970, but this album is better than ever.  This album is loaded with energy; if the band members' soaring harmonies are not always absolutely perfect, well, it's a live album, and it shouldn't *be* perfect.  The highlights of this album are many.  \\"Heaven and Hell\\" starts the album off strongly, with Pete Townshend's power chords, John Entwistle's energetic bass-guitar arpeggios, and Keith Moon's wild drumming blending together perfectly.  I like the slightly slowed-down version of \\"I Can't Explain,\\" the change of pace in \\"Fortune Teller\\" as the song speeds up, the switch back and forth between Townshend and Roger Daltrey on vocals in \\"Tattoo.\\"  \\"Young Man Blues\\" is also a high point; Mose Allison's mellow blues-piano original here becomes a raucous guitar-based rocker.  \\"Amazing Journey/Sparks\\" reminds one how The Who used to play *all* of \\"Tommy,\\" live.  \\"Summertime Blues,\\" overplayed for years on \\"classic rock\\" radio, nonetheless retains all of its power and energy.  And the album ends on a high note as well.  Before first hearing this album, I had wondered how a 14-minute version of \\"My Generation\\" could be sustainable; then I heard it and understood.  \\"My Generation\\" becomes a bluesy medley, with excerpts from various songs from \\"Tommy\\" including \\"Overture,\\" \\"Underture,\\" and \\"We're Not Gonna Take It.\\"  \\"Magic Bus,\\" the encore, likewise possesses bluesy interludes, along with some fine harmonica work by Daltrey.  \\"Live at Leeds\\" captures the power and dynamism of The Who at a high point in their career.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a curve-breaker in this era of sequels, franchises and remakes. Despite technological advancement and higher budgets, innovation is surprisingly rare in mainstream American cinema. Many films base their visual and thematic aesthetic off of formulaic tropes. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, while not particularly innocent in those terms, borrows elements from video gaming, nerd culture, music and experimental cinema to create a unique visual combination.    Director Edgar Wright ([[ASIN:B0025VLEM0 Shaun of the Dead]], [[ASIN:B002HR1W1K Hot Fuzz]]) is himself immersed in the culture he portrays in the film and creates a faithful and authentic presentation. Most of the credit, however, has to go to Director of Photography Bill Pope ([[ASIN:B001NXBRJG The Matrix]], [[ASIN:B0042AGNCI Spider-Man 2]]), who outdoes even himself in creating a hyper-stylized, surreal visual environment. Also, much has to be said about the film's attention to detail. Covert references to Canadian products, bands, video games and computers are prevalent. There's always something new to discover with each viewing.    Michael Cera's performance ranks among the best of his career (somewhere in between [[ASIN:B0002PYS7Y Arrested Development]] and [[ASIN:B0014DFCMS Juno]]). He shows surprising versatility in the role and presents a wide range of emotions. Oscar-worthy, it is not. For an actor (almost unjustly) accused of being typecast, however, Cera does extremely well here, and definitely has the potential to silence a few skeptics. The villains, or \\"League of Evil Exes\\", run the gamut of \\"elitist\\" stereotypes and provide excellent foils for Scott throughout the plot. Highlights include ex-Superman Brandon Routh as Todd Ingram and Chris Evans as Lucas Lee, who both cram hilarious machismo into their performances. Furthermore, the opening fight scene, featuring Satya Bhabha as Matthew Patel, nearly steals the film with its unexpected stylistic twists. On the other end, the performances of Allison Pill and Ellen Wong (as Kim Pine and Knives Chau, respectively) create an interesting contrast and portray two entirely memorable, unique characters.    The Blu-ray presentation, unsurprisingly, is as impressive as the film. Containing an extensive behind-the-scenes featurette, numerous outtakes, deleted scenes, animatics, on-set footage and four audio commentary tracks, there's enough here to enlighten and satisfy film nerds and curious moviegoers. The picture quality is nearly flawless and free of artifacts, compression and edge enhancement. Additionally, the default 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack provides excellent clarity, depth and channel separation. In terms of quality and extras, there are few Blu-rays on the market that compare. A superb release of a superb film.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I was initially concerned that In Treatment was going to be one of those shows that could not maintain the writing, acting and integrity of its first season.  Not so in this case.  Season Two is so much more intense, and Paul's character develops to such a degree that you feel as though you really know him.  I have great faith that the series will be able to continue and develop for many seasons to come.  Be prepared though: this time around, each episode is exceptionally powerful.  This is the kind of show that helps you understand not only others, but yourself....watch out!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|It sure is a damn sad shame how many people are rating this dvd with 1 star just because it's not in 3D GET OVER IT this movie wasn't any different in 2D in 3D it won't be any different just enjoy the movie and stop giving such bad reviews, this movie was fantastic review it as the movie not as a release you don't want, guess what! YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT just wait for the 3D one but you know what not everybody owns a 3D tv. so the 3D version isn't going to sell much yet.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I remember when these songs were released -- by the Beatles.  For me, the best ones here are Walrus, Hold me Tight, Won't be Long, Warm Gun (always was a weird song).  Followed in the next tier by Let it be, Because, Blackbird, All you need is love, Hand. It was astounding when \\"I want to hold your hand\\" and \\"She loves you\\" first blasted out of our transistor radios in 1964.  It was like a shock wave.  Enjoy.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I watched series one and series two was no disappointment.  I could go on and on about how fabulous this was.  I planned to watch it over several weeks.  I hate to admit this,  but I sat down in front of the tube for hrs every night and finsihed in a week!   I couldnt wait to get home to watch it !    I can name this review / show in one word....riveting!
B000WS4OZM|4.0|Solitary Man and Won't Back Down are chilling, great.  \\"One\\" is very good.  I didn't like the other songs on this album much.
B003XD7ECI|4.0|This was an album that I was really looking forward to getting my hands on this year.  With the great voice of Michael Kiske teamed up with a very competent female vocalist, plus band members Magnus Karlsson (Allen/Lande, Primal Fear) and Matt Sinner (Primal Fear, Sinner) on guitar and bass, it was an album that promised much.  The songs have been written for the most part by Karlsson and Sinner and consist of a mixture of melodic metal, hard rock and some lighter rock leaning more towards AOR, and whilst nothing ground breaking they are extremely melodic & catchy.  Sinner and Karlsson have both been around for a while now and have found the winning formula in terms of song writing with their other bands and projects, and as you would expect their playing is first class.  There are some great solos on offer here from Karlsson and Sinner provides some pounding bass rhythm throughout the album, which has been produced to perfection.  Each instrument sounds full and rich, yet clear and don't overpower the vocals, because after all the dual vocals are the whole point of this album.  As far as the vocalists go, both complement each other very well and in contrast to Karlsson's Allen/Lande project there are no songs on this album sung by only one of the vocalists.  Each share parts of all of them, but some obviously have one or the other as the primary vocalist.  Amanda Somerville is very pleasant on the ear, singing in a very melodic way with no operatics.<br /><br />I think the album starts off with a bit of a fizzle though with Nothing Left To Say which musically is great, and both vocalists also sound great, but the song just seems to fail to have enough energy with it in terms of the pace of the vocals to be a winning opening punch in my opinion.  Track 2 is the single Silence and I think it also suffers from the same fate.  In fact, whilst I can't fault the performance or production, the melody or the hooks, in terms of the pace of the vocals over the entire album they hardly ever shift out of second gear.  Almost all the songs are sung at the same pace, that being medium.  I say almost because there are some ballads where you expect a slower pace, and track 5 End Of The Road is a fine example of a great ballad, as are track 7 A Thousand Suns, track 9 One Night Burning and track 11 the more AOR oriented Second Chance.<br /><br />Kiske does get going a little bit more in tracks 6 Don't Walk Away and 10 Devil In Her Heart which are two of my favorites with the former sounding more like the stuff he did with Place Vendome, but for my mind I would have liked him to unleash a lot more as he is no doubt capable of doing.  (If you have heard the songs Cross The Line and Streets Of Fire from the Place Vendome albums you will know what I mean.  That is how Kiske should sing more often).  The last half of the album is better than the first, and in general the music on this album does have a harder edge and bit more bite to it than the music on both Place Vendome albums.  But I wouldn't really say that it is better.  Just as good but different would probably best describe how I feel about it.  But I did expect it to be a better album than what it is, which is quite strange really when I can't really find much wrong with it except for the pace of the vocals.  Certainly though it is not as good as either of the Allen/Lande albums released to date.  I think in terms of being a quality recording it is certainly right up there but ultimately I just don't find it to be fully satisfying and therefore can't give it a 5 star rating.dly ever shift out of second gear.

B001VZY4M8|4.0|What I'm wondering is why there is no CD/DVD edition of this release?  Other releases from the archive series have included a high resolution stereo version (24 bit/96 kHz) on a separate DVD. While the clarity of this CD is truly astonishing, the volume is also overwhelming.  Way too much compression for my ears. Frankly, a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />UPDATE (3/2012): What I did not realize when I purchased this disc is that it is an HDCD. Now that I have a player that decodes HDCD, the volume is much lower and more natural sounding.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|DVD's are excellant, but the packaging of each disc is a mess.  It looks like it was run over by a lawn mower.  Definately not in 'very good' shape as advertised
0451196716|5.0|I am an avid reader of NON-FICTION; that is all I ever read...with the single exception of Stephen King short stories and books.<br />  This book was exhausting...literally.  I could FEEL the exhaustion the walkers felt as the walk progressed.  This would have been a page turner in a regular book but I ordered this through my Kindle so it was a page clicker.<br />  When I began reading this story, it sounded like a fun walk.  100 boys sign up for a walk and whoever outlasts the other 99 is the winner.  Sounds simple.  Then you learn that the rules state the walkers must keep up a pace of at least 4mph.  Should they fall below, they get a warning. After three warnings, they \\"buy\\" their ticket.  This is explained early in the book.  So gullible me is thinking, \\"oh they just lose; they are out of the walk\\".  They certainly are.  After the third warning, they get a bullet in the head!  I nearly fell off my chair when I got to the first person who buys their ticket! Cheeeesh!<br />  Some of the less favorable reviewers state that this was not a good book in their opinion because who would allow their child to enter such a contest?  Well, it is really unfair to give a poor review based on that.  This is a book of FICTION created by one of the worlds most fascinating authors with a mind and imagination that I would LOVE to have!  Stephen King is a gifted, and fascinating writer.  The only NEGATIVE I can say about him is his penchant for killing dogs and cats in his stories.  I've yet to read one book of his that has a dog or cat in it that doesn't meet some horrid fate such as in \\"Pet Semetary\\" and \\"Cujo\\" and all the others.  Even in THIS book towards the very end, one of the guards watching the walkers KILLS an INNOCENT DOG!  HAD I KNOWN that was in this book, I never would have bought it.  I cannot bear to read anything where a dog gets killed...fiction or not.  It breaks my heart as a dog lover and dog guardian.  I cannot understand why he kills dogs in his stories.  That is the only negative I can state in this story; however, I could not rate it less than five stars as the part where the dog gets killed is only a couple of sentences. THAT part of the story could have been omitted entirely and would not have affected this suspenseful \\"edge of your seat\\" thriller.<br />  The dogs in Mr. Kings books and stories (that I've read so far) always meet a tragic end.  It has gotten so that whenever he publishes a new book, I find out if there is a dog in the story; and if there is, I refuse to read it.  Silly, I know, as it is only fiction...but this is something that not only upsets me but every dog loving friend I have, as I've asked. I know Mr. King happens to have both a dog and a cat as pets and loves them...so why does he always seem to bring them to some awful fate in the stories he creates with dogs and/or cats?  I would really like to know.  In \\"The Long Walk\\", the part of the dog getting killed was just a minor mention, and probably why I didn't catch it before beginning the read.  Had that been in the beginning of the story, I never would have finished it; would have deleted it from my Kindle right at that moment.<br />  I realize a lot of people will think my opinion regarding this part of the story is silly, but unless you're a TRUE lover of dogs, something like this...even though it is fiction, is very upsetting.  I really wish he wouldn't do that in the stories that have dogs and cats in them; but he IS one of the greatest writers I've ever come across, and his books are the ONLY fiction I ever read.That is the only negative I can state in this story; however, I could not rate it less than five stars as the part where the dog gets killed is only a couple of sentences.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|I had extremely high expectations going into season 5 because I am such a huge fan of Steven Moffatt. Also, as a fan of the original Dr Who I am aware that the series, by its nature, reinvents itself every few years, so the prospect of a new doctor and a new start was exciting to me.<br /><br />I was, however, a little disappointed to hear so many negative reviews early on, and when I finally got the box set I was prepared to be let down. And while I can think of several ways in which the series could be better, I was pleasantly surprised to find, nay-sayers aside, that season five is by far the best yet.<br /><br />I found that there was a maturity in the storytelling and a restraint in the later episodes that was completely lacking in previous seasons. Yes, the finale was big, but it was also subtle and masterfully restrained, and didn't insult my intelligence like previous finales have done. There was also an artistry in the look of the show that was new, and even the weaker episodes looked gorgeous.<br /><br />And speaking of weaker episodes, the biggest disappointment was Victory of the Daleks. This could have been a decent story, and it wasn't a bad idea, but it was very poorly done. In contrast, the two-parter with the Silurians was a weak, cliched story that was really quite well done. The Silurians weren't particularly interesting the first time around, and look even sillier now, but there were some truly great moments, and oh what a shock at the end!<br /><br />Every other episode was brilliant in its own way, although I did find the pacing too fast at the beginning. Fortunately this improved. I would say hands down the best episode of the season (best ever?) was Vincent and the Doctor. Stunning.<br /><br />And of course I can't write a review without mentioning the new cast. I liked Matt Smith from the beginning, although it wasn't until fairly late in the season that he really \\"clicked\\" for me as the Doctor. Nothing against Matt Smith, it was my own mental barrier. Up till that time I had been enjoying watching him, but all of a sudden he ceased to be the new actor playing the Doctor and became the Doctor. And now that he has, it will make the season that much more enjoyable in the re-watching.<br /><br />Amy didn't win me over until the second episode, and I continued to like her better and better. You just feel a connection with her that is pretty rare even for Doctor Who.<br /><br />And then there's Rory, one of the greatest things about the new series. How he can add so much depth as well as so much lightness is just sheer genius. Fantastic.<br /><br />The return of River Song is very welcome, and promises to become even more interesting in season 6.<br /><br />Overall, despite one true clunker, one weak two-parter, and some pacing problems at the beginning, this was an amazing, amazing season that met and exceeded my expectations. Can't wait to see where the series goes next!been enjoying watching him, but all of a sudden he ceased to be the new actor playing the Doctor and became the Doctor.

0780626966|5.0|The 1998 box set of a nightmare on Elm Street, is a must have for any Nightmare fan. The 2010 collection is a HUGE disappointment!

No bonus material nor special features! Save yourself the disappointment and order the 1998 version.

1416550550|5.0|When Nell turns 21, her father reveals that he found her when she was small child on the dock all alone except for a suitcase and a book of fairy tales. She is forever changed by the news and resolves to find out about her past. With the arrival of her granddaughter, those plans change. Granddaughter Cassandra takes up her quest upon Nell's death, and the story that follows is poignant, mysterious and at times a bit creepy.<br /><br />The point-of-view switches between not only several characters, but also several different time periods. Each section explains and correlates with something that happens in the surrounding sections, which can be both agonizing and delicious at the same time. Morton draws out certain mysteries until the very end, and there were a few times that I totally didn't see the revelation coming, and I really like that.<br /><br />A few things that readers might want to know before they begin reading--Grammar fanatics should be warned that this novel contains sentence fragments, to the extent that you notice it pretty often. It didn't really bother me; I just assumed it is part of Morton's style, however, I haven't read her other two novels to know that well enough. Some friends have expressed their intense dislike of sentence fragments and the like, so I thought it was worth a mention. There are several instances where Morton tells instead of shows, but it wasn't enough to stop me from reading or make me dislike the book. Like I said, it's just something I know some people really dislike and might want to know.<br /><br />There was also one thing that bothered me when nothing else did--Eliza Makepeace was one of the most important characters, and I often felt that I didn't get a clear sense of what was going on inside of her, especially as she got older. I know part of that was to sustain the mystery and tell just enough, but one relationship she has in the story seemed a bit unrealistic for her character. If there had been more of a hint from the character herself, I might have accepted it better. While I understood the motivation, I didn't feel like there was enough from her to back it up.<br /><br />Other than that, I loved every minute of this novel. I look forward to reading more of Morton in the future.might have accepted it better. While I understood the motivation, I didn't feel like there was enough from her to back it up.

0618680004|5.0|I've read the book twice now. Dawkins is a very clever man. His book is well written, always entertaining, sometimes funny, and it will not fail to make you think. I suggest you pick it up and familiarize yourself with the great debate. It is certainly an important issue.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|If you've seen this on DVD previously, it was a bootleg.  This version has much better picture quality and similar audio.  As for the performances, they are fantastic.  It's 1972 Rolling Stones, close to their performing peak, playing classic songs when they were still fresh.  Get this and see what the fuss was all about.  Back then, they were good enough to make two movies for the same tour.  Alas, the other one remains unreleased.  I never thought this would be officially released due to Mick Jagger's apparent indifference to the past, plus it makes the current band look and sound bad.    A few quibbles:  I wish there was more bonus material, and the lighting and camera work are not up to modern standards.  That's the way they did things back then, so I'll take it.
B003L5LEYW|5.0|I was amazed when I first saw that this album existed. Nas and Damian Marley together!  I got to see them live at Outside Lands in Golden Gate park.  If you can buy this at $3.99 on 11/12/2010, it is a no brainer.  Actually this album is pretty much worth any price.  Happy listening.

B003EYVY04|2.0|A very short review.  As a loyal fan, I've seen documentaries, read bios, looked at stills, seen the films repeatedly, read the books, read reviews, and so when the Ultimate Editions were announced I thought I would probably get them but what new information could it provide to me?  I was plesantly surprised with Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets as they added deleted scenes to the film that allowed for viewing of an extended versions, which in some cases made the film flow better like the book.  However, something went amiss in the release of Azkaban as there is no extended version on this Ultimate Edition.  Very disappointed.  I will still acquire these collections but I will not pay for them.  At least I have something for gift lists when I'm asked what I may like to have given to me.  Simply, don't waste your own money for stuff you've seen before.  The pretty box and booklet are only worth other people wasting their money for you.
0783240287|5.0|I found about this production while flipping channels and landing on Ovation TV.  This excellent Broadway production was filmed for DVD while preserving the beauty of a play.  In the extras there are comments from Andrew Loyd Weber about the purpose of the original play (that was to be played at schools).    This play/movie is excellent to be viewed after a long day, specially if frustration and disappointment were part of it.  This remind us of a this old story, told in a brilliant way, and that all events happen for a reason.  It is very refreshing and relaxing.  Enjoy!!
0446195529|5.0|I view these reviews to hear opinions concerning a book that I may commit money and most important hours of my time by reading the book... but give the kindle issue a rest... first because it misrepresents the overall review score if one is just quickly looking at the overall average score... and this does not really reflect on the quality of the book... when you figure in the low scores about the kindle issue... pretty soon we will start to see comments like so many other forums about our president causing the price of these... so give it a rest... just review the book and not the price... like anything else if I feel the product is of value... only then will I consider the price...
B000006SGT|5.0|The Animals went to hell went they went psychedelic. This set focuses on their earlier years when they were at their best: rough, raw, and bluesy. At this stage, early Animals were much better than the early Stones or the early Beatles. Early Stones and Beatles sound almost prissy by comparison. One foot in blues, one foot in rock, the Animals had a tough-guy sound full of strut and soul. It is a musical tragedy that they imploded and the sound disappeared. A lot of 60s stuff sounds damn silly today, but not this. This set will never grow old. There are a number of Animals compilations out there, but this is the one you want to get. This is the one highlighting the sound that put them on the map.
0345505387|2.0|I also ordered the book and while I understood it was a \\"graphic\\" novel, I was still very disappointed.  I would not recommend this book for true fans of the Jamie / Clare story.  I didn't even finish the book.  The lay-out was difficult to follow, the pictures were dark and depressing and the characters looked Asian.  The cover should be changed to reflect the material inside.  It should be a \\"cartoon\\" just like the inside.
B00406UK7S|4.0|This is a beautifully shot movie. It is tight, cohesive with a ton of action and written well. A very pleasant surprise.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|My 4yr old daughter and I went to see Nanny McPhee 2 at the theaters and we loved it so much that I decided to look for the 1st one to see if my daughter would love it just as much and she did. The scenes where the children are being mischievious are just so entertaining as Nanny McPhee takes out her magic stick.
B004A1Y4UM|5.0|I won't belabor the point: This is Volbeat's most accessible record to date, but that is due to the growth and cohesion that is apparent on each track. I own all four studio records and was stuck on \\"Guitar Gangsters...\\" for nearly a year. When I wanted metal I turned up Volbeat.  I wouldn't be surprised if \\"Heaven Nor Hell\\" becomes a hit single and if it does that's great because this band deserves a larger audience!  This is a great rock record.
B0041X90ZS|5.0|After witnessing the Transatlantic show in Philadelphia, I knew this would be a DVD worth buying.   However, I must admit this performance is far superior.  There is no doubt the band is totally enjoying themselves throughout the entire 3.5 hr concert and what else would you expect when you combine the talents from 5 of the best bands on the planet.  Daniel Gildenlow from Pain of Salvation is far more active on this DVD than what I witnessed in Philly and what an amazing and multi-dimensional talent he is. While most DVD's I purchase become regulated to a one and out viewing regimen, I know this one will be watched repeatedly.  If you enjoy music and amazing musicians, buy this.  This is what great music is all about.  Can't help but smile while watching this amazing band.

B003ES5ZPK|5.0|So here's why I love this thing: On the older-model Xbox 360, the HDMI port is under the Xbox video/audio connector port. What this means is that if you have something plugged into the Xbox's main port, the HDMI port is underneath it, and really hard to get to. In my case, I swap my HDMI cable between my laptop computer and my Xbox 360, and because I'm swapping all the time (and don't want to pay for a switch) I have to deal with the Xbox's infuriatingly tight and awkward design constantly.<br /><br />Enter the HDMI Male to Female Swivel Adapter!!! I plugged it into my Xbox 360, swiveled the female end to point away and up, and now I can easily remove/reconnect the HDMI cable without fussing with the Xbox 360's stupid port design.<br /><br />I can imagine this being handy for ANY HDMI device, though. Instead of fumbling around trying to find the port in your entertainment center, you can point this thing up so you can see it. If you need to lessen the amount of space you take up behind the device, this will shorten it a little bit by allowing you to re-direct the cable's angle.<br /><br />It's a simple solution for a frustrating problem. It's low-cost, well-made, and does the trick! I have nothing bad to say about this adapter! It's just what you need for those hard-to-reach connections!
B002IKLMN4|5.0|In retrospect you will feel the content was so very obvious. Yes, but why hadn't you come to the same conclusion, and take the appropriate actions?    I think the most valuable aspect of this book is that it validates and reinforces something you intuitively know but don't act upon.    A great read, I bought copies for friends and family. I'm rereading it now (it's more fun to read than the average novel or magazine).
0061992860|5.0|For such a small book this thing has almost everything from the large version.  The only noticeable differences are where there was a whole list of options, like types of camp fires in the big book, there are only the most useful in this mini guide.  Like other reviewers note what makes this book so great is that it is small enough to slip into your pack and forget about it.  You could have the most comprehensive survival book in the world and it would be worthless if you didn't bring it with you.  The only thing I don't like about this little guy is the fact that the cover turns to mush if it gets a little rain on it.  It really should be made more like a field guide with a plastic cover.  The way I solved this problem was taking packing tape and doing a self-lamination job on the cover.  Now I like it much better because I don't have to worry about it.  If you decide to do this just use some 3M (or similar quality tape) because the cheap stuff gets all sticky in the heat and over time.  I consider this right up there with water, whistle and emergency blanket as a must have item in my backpack.  Just as a side note - The Amazon price is not discounted for some reason so you may want to find a coupon and buy it in a traditional book store.  I paid 4 bucks for mine.    UPDATE:  I now like this version better than the big handbook.  For some reason the information is different/missing on some topics.  I find the medicinal plants section better in this small book.  It is more to the point and useful things like Mullen Tea (that really works for pain and an overall fun camping drink) is left out of the latest big book version.  The solution mixtures for Potassium permanganate(Very useful knowledge for various remedies and disinfection) is also missing from the big version.  Bundle that together with how fast and easy this book is to navigate and it is the hands down winner.
0385341008|5.0|You can read the many other reviews here regarding what the book is about. A relaxing, easy read.  Easy to end up loving the characters and like someone else said, would be booking a trip to Guernsey had I the time and money.  Don't hesitate on this one.  Truly loved it.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I was thrilled to find Wall-E on Amazon!  I ordered it straight way!  My grandson was so surprised and oh so happy to get it!  The seller was true to his/her word .. the DVD arrived in mint condition, wrapped in original wrapping, etc., and delivery time was excellent! When my grandson is happy, I'm happy, so thanks!!!
0385341008|5.0|There are so many positive reviews, I won't say much, other than to add that I found this book a joy and it warmed my heart.  Juliet was a delight to get acquainted with, and I wish I could get to know what happens next!
0385342047|1.0|If Instant headache is your thing, then go ahead and buy this book.  The nagging, whining repetitive words will surely drag you down.  Don't get me wrong, I was a fan of sophia kinsella for the first three shopaholics books.  But her last two books that she has written has a chalk board approach to words that should have been edited at the editors level. The way that the author creates a character with the level of lying and deception towards everyone including her husband and parents creates a bad moral, low integrity air that should not be considered humorous.  Sorry, I would not recommend this book \\"Mini shopaholic\\"  or   \\"Twenties girl\\"  to anyone.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|...the people writing to berate the reviewers for rating the book by price, having  not actually read the book and yet they themselves provide no review!
B003WTE886|5.0|Taylor Swift's latest CD is one more glistening gem for your ears and soul. She is such a great example of someone who is in her true calling! A gifted, ultra-creative, fresh and simply one-of-a-kind artist. And to think, I could be her mother! (I'm in my 50's). My favorite songs right now are \\"Enchanted\\" and this song about a bully (don't have title in front of me). She so sophisticatedly weaves in just the right smatterings of different genre ingredients to take you on a wonderful lively excursion- I marvel at her authentic creativity and instincts. Nothing stagnant or contrived, just real artistry at work. I have great admiration for this artist. I wore her last CD out and had to replace it...I just love popping her music in my car- it elevates and inspires and is truly a treasure. Thank you Taylor!!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This series (especially in blu-ray) is the standard barer for educational and wildlife series. BBC version is the one to get.
B0042JIL2E|4.0|After looking for days on end for something fresh I stumbled upon this little beauty - and the singer isn't bad looking either!    Imelda and her band play kick-ass rockabilly/soulful/jazzy tunes spiced up with a side-order of fun. If you like rockabilly or you are looking for something different than commercial radio rubbish, then Imelda May will not disappoint you. Try it!
B001HN69AY|5.0|Missed it in the theatre. Easy shopping at Amazon... Was this one I pre-ordered? I think so! and received as promised!
B000002G8L|4.0|Thirty years ago I used to listen to this album a lot - especially disc 2.  Over the years I lost it, although I still kept up with Clapton and what he was doing, especially the Guitar Festival stuff.  I saw Just One Night on Amazon at a great price so, for old time's sake, I bought it.  This album was really the model for what Clapton would do for the next 30 years - this is the kind of stuff he does now - but now he does it better.  Age has added punch to his playing that is lacking at some points on Just One Night.  I found some of the tracks lacked energy compared to the way he plays them these days.  Still, I'm not totally disappointed - it is a great step down memory lane and an important piece of the Clapton catalogue.
B001HN694K|5.0|Saw it in 3D and standard view in the theater and wanted to see it again! We've now watched it 4 or so times and plan to take the DVD to Thanksgiving event with family to show again! Pre-order through Amazon was wonderful!
B001GSV3EC|5.0|I've already reviewed this album once but circumstances have led me to purchase it again, so I thought I'd have another go.  I first purchased the album based on Amazon reviews and I wasn't dissappointed.  I loved it so much I bought the DVD as well.   I then lent the CD to a young, local guitar genius after we both went to see Jeff live in Melbourne last summer.  Apparently the CD was well appreciated - so much so that I haven't got it back.  Stephen, if you're reading this, you are welcome to keep it, with my compliments.  Now that I have a fresh copy, it is back on high rotation in my car's CD player.  I must have listened to this CD over 100 times.  I'm now very familiar with all of the little imperfections in the playing, but, mostly, I still get the hairs standing up on the back of my neck during those moments when Jeff and the band take you to a special place.  The subtle nuances that only years of experience can bring, the sudden exhilerating changes, the breathtaking musicianship, the seeming effortlessness - I can't fully express how satisfying this recording is - you'll just have to discover it for yourself.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|We saw this in the theater and wanted to go back again as it was so AWESOME!!! Had to have the DVD to watch again! and again!
B000002ADT|5.0|Sometime, a long time ago, someone gave me this album as my introduction to jazz.  Wow, talk about starting at the top!  I can't remember who that person was - but I thank them deeply for the hundreds of hours of listening pleasure that this has brought me.
1416594795|5.0|As a staunch atheist and someone who needs no convincing about evolution, and really has nothing to do with creationists or evolution-doubters, I wondered how relevant this book would be to me. I already agreed with Dawkins before I picked up the book that evolution is not a theory, it's a fact. Did I need to spend several hours of my life reading a book only to further convince myself that I was right?    The answer: yes. Because aside from building an overwhelmingly strong case for evolution as a fact, the book is thoroughly engaging and interesting to read. While all the little examples and stories given by Dawkins are part of the story and add to his argument, they are also immensely fascinating in and of themselves. I'm no biologist and had no interest in reading a thorough textbook-like document examining all the details of all the evidence. I didn't need convincing about evolution and don't personally know anyone I need to convince. But the book was entertaining, interesting, and took me away to another world for a little while - in the end, isn't that really why we read in our spare time?
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|I like most of Nicholas Sparks's movies, but this one and Dear John has got to be the two films I felt are the dullest of the franchise.  I don't blame the principal actors. They did the best they could with what weak material they had given to them.     The positives? The little brother was just adorable...and ok, the fight scene at the wedding was pretty cool! Also, I dug the storyline regarding the sea turtles. Otherwise, the storylines were somewhat predicatable. Must Nicholas Sparks always have someone die in each of his movies?     However, there are two specific thing that annoyed me greatly about this movie, and made it just about unwatchable, in my opinion.    Flaw #1  The fact that not a single one of the females in this film were nice to each other! I realize it is a romance movie vs a 'buddy' flick, but all that business about how none of the females seemed to like Ronnie, and she had no female friend, was overplayed. Her mother was distant, the other girls were jealous, even the boyfriend's mother was cold to her? Way too much for one movie.    Flaw #2  Where were the people of color in this movie? This is GEORGIA for pete's sake. Come on, surely they could casted one or two Black extras in nonspeaking roles at least! We're not talking political correctness. Just making it a bit more realistic in terms of people who would live in the area.     Sure, go ahead and purchase the film or better still rent it, but just don't expect too much.
B0034JKZ86|1.0|THIS MOVIE IS SCARY AND EVIL!!!! IT'S ABOUT VOODOO AND HAS VERY SCARY IMAGES AND SCARY CONTENT!!!  NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!  AWFUL!!! DISNEY HAS REALLY CROSSED THE LINE!!! WOLF IN ANIMATED CLOTHING!!!  NO NO NO!!!! AWFUL!!!
157270182X|5.0|Love love love. This is just as funny as the rest of the Bertie Wooster and Jeeves stories. Can't go wrong.
0316069485|2.0|The best way to describe this book is mediocre.  No longer do we get a study of Harry Bosch's demons along with his investigative skills.  Rather, Michael Connelly merely combines his two characters, describing one in the first person and the other in the third person, to write a half of a book.  We no longer get Harry running over Los Angeles piecing together leads in his case.  Rather, most of the action center around the courtroom where the trial is described in relentless detail finalizing in a contrived conclusion that was telegraphed in the first 50 pages of the book.  One of the strenght's of this series has been the interweaving of familiar characters from the past but no mention of Kit Rider, Jerry Edgar, Theresa Corazon or even Irwin Irving.  Rachael Walling does a cameo but is not a major player.      Combining these two character just doesn't work and results in a superficial book.  Micheael Connelly - please go back to your roots???
B000VX042U|5.0|I bought the Burgundy Color Boat Shoe. The shoes have a good solid build to them. Good value for money. I paid $86.63 and within a week the price dropped to $73.61. The initial customer service rep said they could not do anything. I called again and the level 2 customer service gave me the price difference. +1 for Amazon.
B00364K6YW|4.0|The remastered version of this BBC miniseries is very watchable and quite enjoyable if you're a devotee of the \\"costume drama\\" as I am. The miniseries format gives plenty of time to the story development and character growth that enhances your viewing pleasure.   I did not yet watch all of the bonus features, but am happy that subtitles or closed captioning are available as my hearing does not quite catch the \\"British\\" accents at times.  Both Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle (daughter of writer John Ehle) are excellent as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, and the Bennet sisters are well-played also. It's a time investment you won't mind making to follow this Jane Austen classic in its beautifully filmed adaptation.
B00000DLV1|5.0|All has already been said about this record, it's pure magic!  After 10 years of listening to it, I find it only better each time.    But the striking fact that I only found out recently, is that this concert was their FIRST(!!!) live performance of new material from the second album. It's really very hard to believe it... bloody miraculous!    I also love the two tracks from this CD ('Roads' and 'Sour Times'), that weren't recorded at Roseland ballroom, but later during the tour.  I prefer these CD versions to the Roseland ones (the latter one can find on the DVD), as they are even more intense, emotional, powerful and fragile.     (And clapping on Roads doesn't bother neither me, nor, apparently, Portishead themselves).    BTW, a video of 'Sour Times' performance close to this CD (scary heart-rending version) is on youtube under the title \\"Sour Times - Live In France - PORTISHEAD\\" and another similar one on German Bizarre festival video.
B00377V6J2|5.0|This Albert King-Stevie Ray Vaughan combo CD/DVD package is worth the price a thousand times over for anyone with even a remote interest, let alone a love of electric blues. I have been an electric blues fanatic for over a quarter of a century and probably twenty-five-per-cent of my free time is spent listening to electric blues... researching electric blues... and spreading the gospel to age groups and races of all kinds. My all-time favorite electric blues CD is Albert and Stevie on the \\"original\\" **IN SESSION** which was created from a TV program in Canada on **DECEMBER 6, 1983** a date that will definitely live on for eternity as a sacred day in the history of **ELECTRIC BLUES**. The original *IN SESSION** CD was released in 1999. It is no exaggeration to say that I have played this CD close to a thousand times. Being that two types of people will probably be reading this review: 1) Someone who already has the original CD and is wondering if it's worth it to lay out what I believe is a steal of a price for the DVD... and 2) Someone who doesn't own the original CD and wonders if they should make the purchase at all... even with the priceless inclusion of this newly released DVD.<br /><br />I obviously, as stated above have the original CD, but I've been searching and hoping and praying for eleven years for a DVD version, because, besides the unmatchable, otherworldly, electrical blues magic these two titanic icons of *STRING-BENDING* *ELECTRIC-BLUES* invented together on that day when all the blues planets aligned just perfectly... is much more than the music itself. Albert King was Stevie's idol... and the vocal interactions between... and during the songs... were so touching and awe inspiring... that the thousand times I listened to the original CD I used to try to imagine what the expressions were on their faces. There were also times when I didn't know for sure who was bending the lead and who was following. You will know it all on this super-stupendous DVD.<br /><br />One fact a potential buyer should be aware of is that the classic \\"BLUES AT SUNRISE\\" though on the CD is not on the DVD. Now that of course is a shame. BUT... BUT... BUT...<br /><br />On the DVD are a couple of songs that I personally have never heard Albert and Stevie do together... especially in such length... and of course not visually. On the DVD they perform **TEXAS FLOOD** together and I mean it when I say that in my blues dominated adult life... I have never seen nor heard such an ethereal heavenly electric blues performance. The entire DVD is *ONE-HOUR-TWENTY-SEVEN-MINUTES-LONG* and not one minute of it is below sensational. *TEXAS FLOOD* is approximately fifteen-minutes long and the string bending from each of these virtuosos has not and CANNOT be duplicated by anyone else on this planet. Another mind-blowing addition to the DVD is Albert's anthem *BORN UNDER A BAD SIGN*... if you're a blues fan who has seen Albert play this... hold on to your seat... as Stevie helps bring it to another level. Another showstopper on the DVD but not previously on the CD is *I'M GONNA MOVE TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN*. If you've been away from true-true electric blues for too long, and aren't sure what the true definition really is... watch and listen to this... there WILL BE NO DOUBT! This is what it can be... but unfortunately may never be again.<br /><br />Another question a potential buyer might have is... this was filmed twenty-seven-years-ago... is it clean and clear? Hell yes! It is crystal clear in color and sound. What else might be important along with the previous items? Emotion... soul... affection for each other... respect... for each other and the blues. You can't miss it. They chit-chat... they exchange glances... they wink at each other... (All the things I could only dream about the last eleven years that I listened to the original CD.)... they sit while they play... they jump up and bend their bodies when they become one with the music... one with their guitar... one with each other. I got goose bumps and actually had tears in my eyes a couple of times. At times they were so fired up that they leaned toward each other and gave each other a soul handshake. There are also a couple of shots of the few technicians off to the side of the stage... and I guarantee you that the expressions on their faces were self-evident... that they knew they were in the presence of electric-blues-genius... and a day like this may never be seen again.<br /><br />Albert King who stood 6-foot-five-inches-tall and weighed at least two-hundred-fifty-pounds cast a mighty big shadow as compared to the diminutive by comparison Stevie Ray... but all size was equalized by the purity of the string-bending-blues that reigned supreme that glorious day. A true electric blues aficionado should also note that the left-handed King \\"played with his guitar held upside-down, treble strings up, causing him to bend his strings down, among other idiosyncratic techniques.\\" Albert's massive hands look like twin XMAS hams adorned with pinkie rings that glittered like Super Bowl rings... but like Stevie he could move them with lightning speed.<br /><br />As of this writing I have published four-hundred-sixty-seven-reviews on Amazon and this is the one I am recommending with the most heartfelt passion. With Albert and Stevie in heaven, I can only hope that when my day comes, if I qualify for heaven... that I'm greeted with their string bending guitars instead of an angel's harp!eir guitar... one with each other.

B000002VFW|4.0|Lisa Stansfield is my 2nd favorite blue-eyed soul diva but I hadn't listened to this disc in a while - one of her videos was shown this week and prompted me to pull this out for a listen.  Lisa's soulful voice and effortless delivery garnered her a lot of r&b fans and her videos got a lot of play on the Video Soul channel back in the day.<br /><br />This disc was a great introduction to the US r&b market and it's notable that she also co-wrote all of the songs which for the most part have stood the test of time.  My faves are:<br /><br />ALL AROUND THE WORLD - beautiful, pure vocals are effortlessly soulful;<br /><br />WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK - very melodic track (love the chorus);<br /><br />YOU CAN'T DENY IT - her 2nd big hit, upbeat track about the power of attraction;<br /><br />THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME - one of the more uptempo tracks that could sound great in clubs today;<br /><br />MIGHT LOVE - although the production sounds a little dated, her vocals still shine through;<br /><br />SINCERITY - stripped down track on which her vocals dominate.<br /><br />If you never heard of this terrific singer and are searching out early '90's r&b, I'd highly recommend giving Lisa's debut a chance.
0143118420|1.0|I dragged myself through the first part and could not bring myself to finish this book.  Considering how much it was praised I found it to be a real let down and was furious at the author for wasting my time like this.<br /><br />Authors personality: flat, boring, incapable of honestly conveying her thoughts and experiences, apparently thinks very highly of herself, shallow- incapable of any deep thought or of extracting any lesson from anything.  Also, came across as a woman with whore-like tendencies, who constantly fantasizes of 20 year old boys wanting to shag her. And here I was all this while, thinking memoirs were the arena of interesting people with amazing life experiences and some sort of insight into life, silly me.<br /><br />There was just too much wrong with this book.<br /><br />It leaves a distinctly unpleasant aftertaste.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Typical of BBC productions, Rome shows a high level of historic verisimilitude. The setting is not used as merely an excuse for extravagant costumery, gratuitous nudity, and pointless violence. Through stimulating dialogue, the characters are clearly drawn and entertain in all shades of human goodness and evil. A shame it ran only 2 seasons!
B0015DROBO|4.0|It's easy to understand why some have been a tad disappointed in TGWTDT and all the hype it has received, because frankly I'm not sure it deserves it.<br /><br />Yes Steig Larsson's first book in this trilogy is a captivating read, an edge of the seat mystery/thriller which will leave you wishing you had more time to read and finish the story. But let's not get carried away, it is what it is, a good story fairly well written, and that's all.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment for me is the main characters of Mikael and Salander. By the end of the book I was left with the feeling that they are particularly two dimensional and fairly bland. I didn't care for them one way or another. Perhaps something got lost in translation.<br /><br />As to some of the objections I have seen to some of the graphic content, I have to say I didn't find it that graphic at all. If it's part of the story and explains more about a character then I have no problem with some of the themes that Larrson included in this book, I didn't find it gratuitous or even particularly graphic.<br /><br />I'm certain the following two books of the series will be just as interesting and nothing short of a really good read, my hope is that Larrson spent a little more time rounding out his characters and making them a bit more likable and interesting.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|This CD is great. There's a catchy song for everyone; even my 2 year old has a favorite! So glad that I bought their CD
B003MTGW80|4.0|\\"Giulini in Hollywood\\" might have been a more appropriate title, as DG has completely excluded the recordings he made in Chicago for the yellow label. Still, this has some of the very best work Giulini did in America, so perhaps the title is rather apt after all. To be specific, I share in the other reviewers' enthusiasm for the Brahms 1 (the 2nd isn't quite as good), the Schumann \\"Rhenish\\", as well as the exquisite \\"La Mer\\". I can't, however, buy into the excessively trudgy tempos that Giulini conjures up for the Beethoven \\"Eroica\\". His broad, late Klemperer-like treatment works better in Beethoven's 5th (at one time, the Beethoven 5 got re-coupled with the Schumann \\"Rhenish\\"). The \\"Pastoral\\" I'm a bit more neutral about - I could take it or leave it. Guilini always liked Tchaikovsky's \\"Pathetique\\" symphony - not an opinion I particularly share,but that's beside the point - and so his L.A. one is nearly as good his much earlier Philharmonia version. The \\"Manfred\\" overture is quite good too, although I would never consider that to be an important work.     Some listeners claim that Giulini used Mahler's retuschen (slight alterations) on the Schumann \\"Rhenish\\", but I'm not so certain. Frankly, I don't know the differences well enough to be positive, but the Mahler versions on the Chailly/Gewandhaus recording of the Schumann symphonies, strike me as being more radically different than here. Regardless, it's one of the great recordings of the Schumann 3rd. The Brahms 1 and \\"La Mer\\" are right up there too. It's just a shame that Giulini couldn't have recorded a Bruckner symphony in L.A. as well - THAT would have been truly interesting.
B000TXR1GO|5.0|Anthony Bourdain is great, in reading this book it was like it was the story of my life but told from by an east coast guy. I also love his TV show of Travel channel, I would love to venture with Tony to all those great places he goes.
B001THZAAI|5.0|This is a very funny French comedy that had my wife, friends, and I laughing throughout the movie.  It is too bad that the aversion to seeing a subtitled movie means the majority of Americans will never see this joyous comedy.  What we do for love can often leads to strange, ill thought out decisions that lead to unintended consequences, but nevertheless end up making us better people and enhance our lives.  Allow the plot to develop and the true character of the people that we encounter to unfold and the beauty of this movie becomes apparent.
1439107955|5.0|The brilliance of this book is the effortlessness with which the author draws the reader into the world of cancer and keeps him there as a tourist or witness.  Dr. Mukherjee's engaging style, precision of prose and overwhelming compassion imbue this work with an energy that carries the reader along a ride like none other.    Whether the reader is a basic scientist or sociologist, a patient or healthcare provider, a philosopher or philanderer, this book will appeal, entertain and educate.    A remarkable achievement.

B000002A3T|4.0|Amid the ridiculous speculation of the sum of it's contributing band members, there lies a cohesive and thoroughly satisfying album. Elitist, so-called \\"hard-core\\", fans dismiss this in an effort to remain eternally contrary and retain their higher ground purist views - like they're part of an elevated understanding that most mere mortals couldn't possibly comprehend.  Really, get over yourselves and just listen to the music. Gilmour and Waters represented a \\"Yin & Yang\\" within the creation of some very memorable and well respected albums. Both were essential to each other in the creation of these albums, with the ever perpetuating myth of Waters dominant and all-consuming creative influence being like (over the many years that have passed) a bad game of chinese whispers. If anything, unlike McCartney and Lennon who both created vital post-Beatles music, all that history has proved is that Gilmour can survive without Waters and that Waters disappears up his own extremities without Gilmour.
B00180R06I|5.0|There are many other reviews about the contents of this set, but I wanted to chime in with my recommendation.  Everything about it is well planned and executed:  The texture of the box and selection of photos on it. The book.  The subtle, but effective menu design.  The choice of subtitles.  And Vampyr itself improves with each viewing.  For such an old film it's still wonderfully unsettling with many images lingering about... like a shadow.  The cumulative effect is just great.
0307454541|2.0|I cannot figure out what all the hype is about. Several people recommended this book to me but I found it to be a violent, vulgar and the writer has absolutely no style. In short it is similar to most of the books written today - garbage. This book could easily have been 100 pages shorter. The author included much detail that was absolutely unnecessary and added nothing to the story. Look elsewhere for a good book.

B003LAH7MU|5.0|I read no reviews before buying the CD--it's Sting...what more is there to say?!! I cried throughout, thinking isn't this the perfect next step in Sting's endless and tireless search for beauty, and expression, and love for sharing his music!     I love the orchestra and how it takes Sting's music even higher and higher. His voice is so strong and powerful, so wonderful and celestial, the orchestra only builds on the beauty of Sting's music...the magnificence that is Sting.    Great music, great Sting! Reading the reviews, especially the one from his producer, makes me appreciate the CD even more! Thanks, Sting, for another magical musical adventure!
0756405890|5.0|After reading Rothfuss' blog for months, I finally settled down and read this book. I actually liked it more than George Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. A gripping story with a familiar coming of age story, yet is told in a fashion that is fresh and feels real. Anyone into a good book should pick this one up.
B002ZG980U|4.0|This movie has got it where is counts, here are the things that I like about this movie:<br /><br />[1] Mind-Bending Plot<br />[2] Great acting<br />[3] Superb Special Effects<br />[4] Plenty of Action<br />[5] Suspenseful Music<br /><br />Unlike most movies, this film has a high degree re-playability; meaning that you don't get everything in one sitting. I would say that by the third time you will be able to fully understand the plot, and appreciate its full depth.<br /><br />Initially, you are not sure what's happening. But as a new dream architect is enlisted, you learn along with her.<br /><br />At the height of the movie, the action unfolds on 5 levels, each with its own perspective on the speed of time, as follows:<br /><br />- Real World<br />- First level dream<br />- Second level dream (inside of first dream)<br />- Third level dream (inside of second dream)<br />- Limbo (where you go, if you die inside of a nested dream)<br /><br />This film is a must-see as far as I am concerned. It is a real Thriller to the very end.
B003AYBCV4|3.0|I recently acquired a copy of this Audio Fidelity gold CD and have to say I was disappointed. Back in 2001 CBS released a S&G box set entitled Columbia Studio Recordings 1964-70 [Box set, Limited Edition, Original recording remastered]. It included all five S&G studio albums lovingly remastered to audio perfection. To my ears the 2001 box set version is much more satisfying; there is dimension and depth to the mix where the gold version sounds flat and one dimensional. Now there are those who will assert otherwise, but in the end we all have to decide what sounds the most pleasing to our own ears. In either case you can't go wrong with these well crafted tunes, enjoy!
B002NANLCE|4.0|As with many other reviewers, I purchased this book after the TV series - which I loved - was canceled.  Mr. Sawyer tells a compelling story - it's quality science fiction - but be aware that the book goes in a completely different direction than the TV series.  The book is much more straightforward, while the TV series added many layers of characters and complexity, presumably for the Hollywood effect.  Perhaps the TV series tried too hard leading to the show's demise?  Usually the book goes into more depth than the screen version, but here it's the opposite.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, the only character the TV series keeps pretty much the same is Lloyd Simcoe.  Most of the other TV characters are based from the book, but the TV writers twist things a great deal.  Also, the flash-forward in the book is 21 years ahead, vastly different from the TV series.  In short, the TV series only used the most basic and general ideas from the book.  The book has no FBI angle; it's strictly the physicists and society that the plot centers around, and there's no deeper conspiracy at play.<br /><br />I think many of the negative reviewers are being unfair.  They are giving the book a low rating because they were frustrated when no answers to the show were provided, but that's not the purpose of the book; it was written before the TV series!  One should review this book as a separate entity.  Again, it is vastly different from the Tv series, but I still enjoyed both.  It was cool to see a different take on the same theme.<br /><br />So yes, if all you want is answers about the TV series, don't bother.  If you want to enjoy a fun piece of sci-fi as it's own entity, I highly recommend it.
1401923119|3.0|Although the book is a very useful topic, the fisrt several chapters could be reduced down to about 20 pages of information and the last chapter of the book could be removed completely.  If you want to plod through all the idealogy in this book, you can get some useful information from it.
B0017OB12O|5.0|Although the past DVD editions of David Lean's 1957 spectacular The Bridge On The River Kwai sported a decent enough transfer this new Blu-ray release (with a corresponding DVD included) finally reveals the true scope and brilliant Technicolor that moviegoers must have witnessed at the film's opening 53 years ago. And believe me, the Blu-ray disc reveals detail never before available to the viewer ; one has only to look at the accompanying DVD to notice a vast difference in clarity. The newly restored picture and sound dazzles the eye and ear like never before, showcasing Jack Hildyard's Oscar -winning cinematography and Malcolm Arnold's stirring music score (equally honored) in a way that heightens one's enjoyment of the film. More importantly, the Blu-ray captures the actors' eyes and facial expressions in a way the DVD was never able to , and it makes a world of difference. The Bridge On The River Kwai was director Lean's first foray into epic filmmaking and in many ways this may be the best of his huge productions. He followed Bridge with Lawrence of Arabia (still awaiting a Blu-ray release) a film that stands beside Bridge in terms of greatness but a bit long winded and not quite as focused story-wise as the former film. Doctor Zhivago and A Passage To India , both estimable achievements, are currently available on Blu-ray. Don't hesitate to pick up this title, even if you have the older DVD. The price is reasonable and you won't regret it.

The twist of a retrial mades for an interesting back drop to the give and take in this well told story.  A qucik read in the now classic Connelly style.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This show is beyond awesome. I started watching it out of a love for HBO's Rome, and at first I was not interested. It seemed too forced and over-played the first few episodes. But soon throughout the season, you grow entranced by the complicated stories of people struggling to gain freedom, power, or love. There is a lot of sex and gore, but I'm a 22 year old woman and I thought it was artistic and sexy.   I really became committed to the characters, and there are plenty of moments that made me teary eyed. I laughed a lot as well, and was awed by the fighting sequences.  Overall a great show. Highly recommend it, if you can handle some gore and sex, and can enjoy a historical drama filled with funny, sad, gruesome, and romantic moments.
B003X73QA8|5.0|This tome to life in post-housing meltdown suburbia is both discordant and exuberant. It celebrates being young in the age of foreclosures, unemployment and market meltdowns. Songs about broken dreams are complemented by tributes to the resilience of the human spirit - \\"If the businessmen drink my blood, like the kids in art school said they would, then I guess I'll just begin again...\\" This album has so many tracks, but together they tell a story, each one a necessary building block upon the others. The sound is reminiscent of Curve's best tracks, with a Swervedriver-esque energy, and yet feels completely fresh. It exposes and almost celebrates the transience of modern life. In a time filled with very private tragedies, Arcade Fire's The Suburbs somehow manages to make us feel like we're all in this adventure together.
0596805888|5.0|This book is definitely not for everyone. It's exciting and interesting if you are someone who asks a lot of \\"why\\" questions. If you want a bunch of great recipes that are easy to use, buy any of Mark Bittman's cookbooks (they're awesome). If you want to learn more about what's happening under the covers, then this book will keep you riveted. Jeff Potter has done something I never thought possible - explain the science behind cooking in such a way that it makes sense AND you can easily apply it! Let me start by saying that culinary arts is not something I excel at but as a technical person, I enjoy learning and experimenting with the the science behind cooking and you'd think I would be a better cook as a result, but I never seem to be able to cross the chasm of using the knowledge in a beneficial manner. However, with \\"Cooking for Geeks\\" I finally made a loaf of homemade bread that didn't immediately become hard tack for the birds in the backyard!! The explanation of the chemistry in taste, flavorings, and composition was fascinating, but also incredibly helpful in tempting me to experiment with what might seem to be odd pairings of ingredients. I've often thought cooking is really about technique, not so much about recipes, and Potter's book certainly arms you with the foundation to go forth and create in the kitchen. Finally, I found the organization of the book to be well thought out therefore more useful; lots of little snippets so reading and reference are very easy - Potter gets the point quickly and efficiently.
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|Just with the shear amount of material they included in this package, the weak sections are buried by getting a great overall product for the money.<br /><br />I assume one is reading this as a fan of this version so I will skip the content review except to say this is a dark version and there are several scenes that when played in the store scared some of the younger kids. The picture quality is as expected, with flawless details and amazing depth carried throughout. The colors and saturation look exquisite and there are plenty of chances for failure with that floating candle ghost and the amount of dark alleys and rooms. The special features are a serious mixed bag though.<br /><br />* Making of/Capturing Dickens, 14:39 minutes. Visually narrated by a very irritating actress trying to be funny but she wasn't. Screening it for customers had them asking to fast forward past her to get to the few good points of how they made the film, it is worth skipping this option and watching the next one:<br />* On set with Sammi, 2 minutes. Short but very informative look into how they did the motion capture effects with her - short but to the point and worthy.<br />* Deleted scenes, 6 @ 8:39 minutes with quick Zemeckis intro. All are in rough format with the actual actor face(s) placed on the animated characters. Not fun to watch as the format gets distracting. Better at that point to watch the main feature with the PiP.<br />* 25 Days of Christmas. Cannot stress enough the frustration and unworthiness of this feature. If you do perform this function make sure your player is smoking fast. After it loads up, 25 icons appear on your screen that when selected, a quick or fun little Christmas icon pops up and goes away just as fast, then goes back to menu. It does not let you select ahead so by the time I got to 9 I was fried.<br />* Blu Ray 3D info with the Lion King critters, 4:13 minutes. A marketing promo for the new format with some stock footage from the films of two of the critters. Skipper.<br />* Dig Copy promo.<br />* Disc 2 - DVD with most of the features and specs as listed on the DVD package.<br />* Motion Capture Picture-in-Picture during playback, optional commentary with Zemeckis. I was disappointed with this as they went with a 10% screen fill instead of a bigger shot. All scenes from credits to credits have the actual footage taken in the effects studio with the actors. Fun to watch to see how the transfers were actually done and what the actors looked like. It plays well in the store for people to see how it was all done, too much going on when the commentary was selected so left that off after the first 10 minutes so cannot review his content.<br /><br />The picture was beautiful, the DTS was outstanding.

B003UTUQ3E|5.0|This is what Bowie fans want and need - superb packaging, extras and music from the vaults!  Although I owned the Nassau 1976 set on cassette tape (high grade metal-oxide no less!) - listening to a properly mixed concert surpasses anything else.  Nassau 1976 is THE Essential live Bowie set.  Thank you technology!<br /><br />If I sound more enthused about Bowie's live offering than Station to Station, I am.  Station to Station was a mini magnum opus in itself - but always felt more like a suite than a full album.  An EP rather than an LP.  Bowie was going spare into his albums by this time and Low would confirm that direction.<br /><br />The live album however confirms Bowie's greatness and passion as a live performer.  There isn't a bad track in this set.  Sure, he was on drugs, booze and despite the side effects of the cocaine, Bowie and his gang delivered.  This is rock and roll.<br /><br />The only fault with this album is the truncated live version of Panic in Detroit - why?  I always loved the original live version with the killer drum solo.  Sure you can download it somewhere, but hmm...<br /><br />So, here's wishing for the future of Bowie reissues.  They should find more live material, more photos - they all look great.  Honoring the man with a cool package is testament to his genius and impact on modern music.  Kudos too to the great musicians that Bowie surrounded himself with.<br /><br />This box set raises the bar and credits go to who? at EMI for doing such a beautifully integrated package.

B00003CXXS|2.0|When watching Jurassic Park III I couldn't help but think one thing...why?  Why did they make this movie?  I tried to like it but I have to say the only good thing about this one was Sam Neill's return as Dr. Alan Grant and Laura Dern's cameo.  The premise of the story is that a boy and his mom's boyfriend are parasailing near Isla Sorna when they crash, then the parents of said boy go to Dr. Grant and trick him into going to Isla Sorna.  The story itself was cheesy but what made it worse was the whole raptors are super intelligent (and I mean ridiculously intelligent) granted we knew Raptors were smart in the first couple films but now they have their own speech and...yeah it's...a little much.  Another thing a lot of this movie is just a compliation of left overs from the first book (i.e. the river boat, the bird cage.)  I could go on but my advice is if you enjoy the first couple films steer clear of this one.  (Not that I really enjoyed the Lost World that much.)

B001RT89TC|5.0|If you fancy yourself a guitarist or just a plain old enthusiast of hard rock/heavy metal music, you simply must listen to this album! I own over 2000 albums in my music collection, most of which are in the aforementioned \\"hard rock/heavy metal\\" category, and I have never heard a more cleanly produced hard rock album. This one is an absolute gem.<br /><br />Aside from Martin Birch's fantastic production, Michael Schenker's extraordinary musicianship has never been more in evidence than on \\"Assault Attack.\\" His phrasings are melodious yet not sappy, torrid yet not overbearing, substantial yet not in contrast to the flow of each song.<br /><br />I was an admirer of Schenker's before receiving \\"Assault Attack\\" as a Christmas gift way back in 1982; however,  this album made me a lifelong devoted fan. Perhaps the only true down-side to this recording for fans of the \\"Mad Axeman\\" is that it left us with a longing for the next \\"Assault Attack\\"-type album from Michael Schenker; an event which to this date has never happened. While Schenker has had many fantastic albums in his storied and influential career, nothing compares to this one.<br /><br />There's something truly different with Schenker's tone on this album. While Schenker is noted for being a master of tone and feel across the spectrum of his career, the guitar sounds on this recording are unlike anything I've heard on a hard rock album before. I'm not sure how much is attributeable to Birch's influence and how much is Schenker experimenting a bit. Whatever the reason, wow does it work! While most guitarists in this genre push the volume envelope for attack, Schenker seems to go with a \\"less is more\\" approach on this recording. Schenker's rhythm guitar sounds pack more punch than ever before yet the tones in the lead breaks display an otherworldly softness that, stangely enough, in no way diminish the heaviness of the music. In fact, quite the contrary is true; the subtler tones in the lead breaks, in my opinion, add to the intensity of the rhythm section (bass, drums and rhythm guitar combined). Schenker's practice of layering multiple harmonized guitars in his solos is more prominent (and better used) than ever behind Martin Birch's superior helmsmanship. In some ways, \\"Assault Attack\\" reminds one of a more cleanly produced early Iron Maiden recording; not coincidental given the fact that Birch was Maiden's producer AND that Schenker was one of their influences. I have no doubt that having worked with Maiden for some time prior to this recording, Birch saw an opportunity with \\"Assault Attack\\" to use Schenker's readily familiar stylizations and superior talent level to produce his very own hard rock \\"magnum opus.\\"<br /><br />Another tremendous feature on this work is that each musician turned in an epic performance: Chris Glen on bass, Ted McKenna on drums, Graham Bonnett on vocals and of course Michael Schenker on guitar, seem to reach a pinnacle as individuals and as a unit of musicians performing together. Oddly enough, \\"Assault Attack\\" was barely in the racks of the local music stores when Bonnett and Schenker had a huge falling out and parted ways shortly thereafter. I even recall a video for the \\"pop\\" song of the album, \\"Dancer,\\" in which the newly rehired singer, Gary Barden, voiced over Graham Bonnett's vocals. Ah yes, what could have been if only this incarnation of MSG had remained intact for a few more albums.<br /><br />Do yourself a great favor and get \\"Assault Attack.\\" I believe you will be sincerely satisfied with your purchase.

160094048X|5.0|Easy vegan recipes in here that actually taste amazing. I made the Oatmeal Raisin cookies this week since I was craving something sweet and it was the only one where I had almost all the ingredients in the house. I had to swap raisins for Reeses Pieces but it still came out okay lol. My mom seriously LOVED the cookies and wanted a copy of the recipe. This book is pretty thick and there are many different cookies to choose from. The only drawbacks are some obscure ingredients you won't easily find at the grocery store (spelt flour, etc). I'm actually a cupcake person but I like this book better than the authors' cupcake cookbook since it has way more recipes.

B0042YHC38|1.0|Ok, so the nice part is that the iPhone fits snugly inside and is secure.  It has reflective accents, and the plastic screen allows you to use the touch screen without having to take the phone out of the case.    Sadly, the bad part about this arm band is that it is made out of non-stretchy material.  So, if you wear it on your arm you have a choice - too tight so it stays on, but it cuts off your circulation (literally).  Or you can wear it at a comfortable tightness, but it slips off when you straighten your arm (bicep non-flexed).    In addition, the case covers the light sensor that adjusts the screen brightness; so the phone senses it is in a low light situation and dims the screen brightness. That would be great, except when you are outside and it is the middle of the day and you can't see the screen anymore because it has been dimmed.
B003ES5ZPK|4.0|My receiver doesn't accept HDMI, thus I'm using the 3rd HDMI port on my [[ASIN:B002M0R7KC Panasonic VIERA S14 Series TC-54PS14 54-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV, Black]], which is on the side, so I'm looking for a right angle adapter.  Coincidentally, I can't comment on the audio performance, since that travels through optical.<br /><br />Anyway, the side HDMI port is oriented in a manner than doesn't work perfectly with this adapter.  The adapter can swivel 90 degrees, but that isn't needed for my TV.  It can also rotate to 80 degrees or so, which helps a lot.  This is enough to almost hide the HDMI cable, and it's good enough for me.  The video is superb (no extra artifacts or added delays with HDMI \\"handshake\\"), and I suppose the audio would be as well, but I can't offer any real opinion.
0316098337|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down.  So I'd really caution you to carefully think about when you open it.  Really.    From page one I was hooked into the 5 year old narrator's story, fully immersed in his world that measures a mere 17X17.  Even knowing the premise of this story did not protect me from becoming emotionally involved with these characters. Oh! and the tension!  My husband walked into the room I was reading in when I was about half way through the book.  He tried to speak with me, but all I could do was wave him away.  And this was after reading for hours.  I know reviewers often say they couldn't put a book down, but I actually couldn't.  In fact, I couldn't even take my eyes off the page for a large portion of it.    I actually read through almost all of it in one sitting, staying up way past my bedtime until I made myself go to sleep (it was a week night and work was looming).  I quickly finished it the following evening (that's what I get for starting it during the work week).  The only part I didn't feel as strongly connected to was the last 30 pages or so.  The ending does have a nice closure, but I have to say I was beginning to lose my connection to the characters towards the end, although this could have been because of delaying reading the last bit until the next day.      Donoghue nails the world of the child and the intimate relationship between a mother and child, and yet she does not ignore the complications of human interactions.  Although I was not familiar with Donoghue before reading this book, I will be looking for her other book soon.  But I'll be sure not to start it until I know I have a full day to read it.  Just in case it's as good as this one.

B003CFBQBW|5.0|The soundtracks are definately the best part of the Twilight franchise, and this one is the best yet.  I never buy whole albums anymore, but I made an exception for this one- and I'm glad I did.  The movie left some of the best songs out, which was a huge bummer, so don't judge the soundtrack by what you heard in the movie.     My favorite is the brooding, sexy, Heavy in Your Arms (Florence and the Machine). What Part of Forever is opposite in tone- bright, upbeat, fun. Band of Horses and the Dead Weather also have especially great songs.      I don't know why some of the best alt/indie musicians agree to contribute to a movie made for teen girls who have probably never heard of them, but I'm glad they do.
0393072231|4.0|This is a great book. Compelling characters. Terrific story telling. Interesting narrative. And, facts that will make you furious!     I live in one of the epicenters of The Great Recession: Phoenix, Arizona. I picked up this book because I wanted to educate myself on what really caused the economic collapse. The media has done an amazingly poor job telling the story of how our economy suffered such an historic setback. And, the vast majority of Americans have no grasp of the details.     Yes, this book has some parts that are you'll need to read slowly due to all the financial terms and concepts, but those pages are few and far between. Michael Lewis did a terrific job arming the reader with the facts they need to understand the meltdown without spending too much time on technical terms. This is told like a movie. It has main characters who you get to know well and who you cheer for and against. And, along the way you learn how broken the American financial system is. I highly recommend it.

The first DVD is quite long and you soooo get your money's worth. Then the second DVD she teaches you choreography for one of her dances and then breaks it down piece by piece. She is incredibly clear and percise. You learn lots of vocabulary. She is a true master of belly dancing. This was a gift from my mom and sister for my birthday and I LOVE IT! Big thanks to them for it! Bravo Rachel Brice!
B003UYUQZW|4.0|Persia is the most powerful empire of its day.  Its power stretches from China to the Mediterranean Sea.  The king has two sons, and when he sees true honor and courage from a street urchin he takes him into his house where he is reared as one of his sons and a prince of Persia.  This boy grows up to be Gyllenhaal's character.  Now grown, the sons are out maintaining and expanding the kingdom via military campaigns.  They are advised by the king's loyal brother (Kingsley), and they are convinced by their uncle to attack a sacred city that they are forbidden by their father to attack...that's the story's set-up.<br /><br />This is a reasonably good action adventure.  There are lots of battles, there is political intruigue, ancient mysticism, assassins, no, make that Hassassins, and the possibility of romance.  There are plenty of plot twists, adequate character development, and pretty good acting, for the most part.  The special effects are, of course, what make the show, but that's OK.  While it had the potential to be moderately deep, the producers didn't pursue that option.  There's a pretty good moral to the story, and it winds up in true Disneyesque fashion.<br /><br />Oh, one more thing, be prepared to be creeped out briefly by some snake effects...you'll see.<br /><br />I have to say that I enjoyed the show, though I don't think I'll need to watch it again.  It's definitely not a 5-star show in my book, though it is definitely a 3-4 star offering, probably closer to 4 stars, so that's what I'll give it.<br /><br />4 stars
0446195529|5.0|I have read all the Camel Club books to date.  But consistent with many of the readers who have decided, because of the relatively high ebook price, to low-ball the book's rating before even reading it, I have decided to do the same but with a twist--I'm giving the book FIVE-stars before reading it.  In this way, I will be offsetting (neutralizing) one of the low ratings.  Hardly enough to make a difference but perhaps others will follow suit.  Here's my thinking.  When I buy a book, I am buying a STORY.  Whether that story is delivered in book form, ebook form, audiobook, or whatever, it is the tale that interests me and not the medium.  If a story is worth $15 to me, I will pay the $15 whether it is delivered by killing trees, pushing bits around an ebook reader, or via an audio signal.  I like all formats and all of them deliver the same value to me.  And while it is true that the costs of producing each medium vary, that's not my issue.  I'm buying value, which I peg to story, not paper or electronic ink.  Will the author make more money by agreeing to deliver the story in a variety of formats, some of which are less costly to replicate?  I hope so.  He created the story after all.  I'd rather seem him get whatever profit is derived from an alternative delivery mechanism than the producer of the media.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|Stephen Sommers did \\"The Mummy\\", \\"the Mummy Returns\\", and \\"Van Helsing\\".  His talents are perfectly matched for creating an epic, futuristic, army movie.  He really is one of the leading FX directors in the world.  And he succeeded tremendously with this pic.  The action is nuanced, including close-up sequences, and carries the story in an effortless way.  It does have the feel that it is a landmark film in terms of FX sophistication.<br /><br />As for the cast, it is outstanding.  You have Sienna Miller going up against Alias's very own Rachel Nichols, and the whole thing solidly anchored by Dennis Quaid.  And Channing Tatum as the solid hero figure.<br /><br />And for fans of the comic books, I do think it captures the vibe very well.  You know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, and it's all gungh ho, and let's go get em, on a world-shaking scale.<br /><br />It is a top-notch FX film, with a great sound-track, with great villains, and with an interesting story, and great pacing, and a stellar cast.  Highly recommended.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|It's hard not to evoke comparisons to other bands when reviewing this CD because let's be honest, Tame Impala has perfectly captured the essence of several bands that have paved the way before them.  But while playing Spot the Influence is an easy, winnable game with this band, that in no way means that their debut album \\"Innerspeaker\\" is in any way boring, predictable, or simply a re-hash of previous ideas.  Instead, Tame Impala has taken the space rock vibes of early Pink Floyd, the bluesy riffs of Cream, the over-the-top psychedelica of The Flaming Lips, put them into an blender, and created something exciting and new.<br />  Opening track \\"It Is Not Meant To Be\\" sets the tone.  A short burst of static, a heavily effected arpeggio, and a lazy drum beat loaded with cymbals sets the stage for a galloping guitar riff that evokes images of playing under the stars in the Australian Outback with the mysterious red Ayers Rock as a backdrop.  This is big, expansive music.  When the lyrics arrive, also heavily effected, the tale is one of frustrated love with an obligatory reference to sitting around smoking weed (hence the problem- she doesn't want to!).  The closing guitar solo is powerful but kind of lazy, in that succinct, direct way that David Gilmour made so effective.  The song then fades away in a mess of noise.  A perfect table setter for what is to come.<br />  \\"Solitude is Bliss\\" sounds like it belongs on Cream's Greatest Hits- a bluesy stomp with a beautiful dreamlike coda.  \\"Jeremy's Storm\\" is the to-be-expected instrumental that builds to a noisy climax closely related to the epic climaxes of such songs as \\"Echoes\\".  \\"Runway Houses City Clouds\\" takes us back to the Outback and its hard not to imagine watching the sun set as the band takes us into musical twilight.  And \\"Lucidity\\" is just a great song, with catchy riffs, nasty guitar, a driving rhythm section, and a singer complaining about a lack of lucidity.<br />  Despite the obvious connections to the past, Tame Impala has created a great album that sounds fresh and forward.  Well worth the purchase!Impala has created a great album that sounds fresh and forward.  Well worth the purchase!
0385751893|5.0|Some critics are furious over historical inaccuracies or absurdities in this book. But most readers (kids) know that it's a work of fiction, and as such, it is allowed to take such liberties. Readers looking for non-fiction should seek out a different book. But no other work of historical fiction has resonated so powerfully with American youth in decades. This book has introduced huge numbers of young adults to the Holocaust. To those criticizing this book for accuracy: please remember that the genre historical fiction includes the word fiction. The important thing is that this book introduces young readers to a serious, somber topic and evokes empathy while doing it... and possibly some readers even leave the book with the feeling \\"never again...\\"
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Definitely a great movie.  It keeps your attention the whole time and the ending is interesting and not necessarily anticipated.  The blue ray actually is done very well.
055357342X|3.0|After reading the first two novels in this series I was excited for the third despite hearing some negative views on it. After reading it, I have very mixed feelings which the first two novels did not elicit.    The Good:    If you enjoy the characters as much as I did, you will enjoy seeing and reading about them again. As far as plots go, it is fun to read how each one evolves and changes for both good and bad. The plot seems to unfold a little more detail about the overall world especially about the great north and the lands beyond it. You get a more \\"gritty\\" feel in this novel and it works well. The twists to the plot were things that no one could ever see coming and it kept me turning pages. Jon Snow, Jamie Lannister, Tyrion, and Arya's roles are especially well crafted in this novel in my opinion. Stannis Baretheon and the red lady, Melisandre have an interesting part in this novel and I want to read more about them as I have clues of my own as to where I think it is going. You can't help but feel for them all in their own specific ways with their dilemmas.     The Bad:    Many, many characters are killed off. Now, I know you can't get too attached in these novels, but a LOT of people die, and many will leave you scratching your head as to why. Now that some iconic names are gone, minor or lesser characters have to step up to greater roles and this is not really done too well and almost seemed forced by the author. Also, it seems like every minor character you meet along the roadside feels as if he has to tell his entire family geneology, hopes, dreams, and every minor detail that ever happened to him/her. Very, very, VERY annoying and takes away from time that can be given to the main characters. It made me feel like it was a chore to read through some of those pages and I caught my attention drifting and would have to re-read whole passages only to find that it was some no-namer spouting off about things that had no meaning.    The Ugly:    The ending. It felt to me like an editor or publisher looked at this and said, \\"Ok, that's ENOUGH! ENNNOUGHH!!! Stop it here, it's gotten way out of control, it's too lengthy, and this is as good a spot as any to stop!\\" Also, Lady Catelyn Stark's ending was confusing - REALLY confusing. I had to go online and read more about it to understand it because it wasn't explained well at all. That left a sour taste for me. To end the novel that way just seemed like poor decision-making especially when Catelyn is so important.    Overall - read it. Buy it. Enjoy it. But be wary of what others have said about the series being unfinished. I have to seriously question George R R Martin's dedication as an author and writer when there is already an HBO series coming out and he hasn't finished the next novel which he has supposedly been writing for between 2-3 years!
B002VKE1K2|5.0|For the most part I seem to be immune to being scared during horror films. Films like \\"The Exorcist\\" or \\"Blair Witch Project\\" just don't scare me in the least. I could only name maybe a handfull of horror films that have actually gotten me scared in my life. Now I wasn't one of those people walking into this thinking it was or was based on real footage. If it was real footage it would be labeled as a documentary which this wasn't.This film can though be called a mockumentary by making it look real like in an actual documentary but fictional. This film was made on a very low and almost non-existant budget but still accomplishes what many more higher budget horror films could not do. The film builds in suspense as it moves along. The use of silence and waiting for something to happen is one of the main ways this film builds this suspense. It Starts out slow with subtle signs of a demon presence and develops more fear and horror with the demon haunting becoming more violent and more occurent. The idea of having the thing right in the room with you without you knowing exploits the human fear of being watched. Despire some flaws in logic with the characters(Why didn't they leave the house?)this movie still ends up being a good horror movie filled with creepy moments and relentless suspense. This film does however lose its affect after multiple viewings.
0439023521|5.0|My thirteen year old daughter read all three books in the THE HUNGER GAMES series in about two weeks.  With school, homework, sports, band, chores, etc., that is saying quite a lot.  She loved them, every word; couldn't stop talking about them.  My husband became so curious to find out what she was raving about, that he got the \\"books on tape.\\"  He listened to them straight through, barely stopping to eat and sleep.  Finally, he said to me, \\"you HAVE to read these!\\"  In fact, he took over our 5 year old's bedtime routine, and sent me to bed with the first book so that I could read it.  Since this is a rare luxury, I jumped at the chance.<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES is set in a future, post-apocalyptic, dystopian society, where each year the Capitol culls 2 children, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18, from each district.  These 24 children, called \\"tributes,\\" must then fight each other to the death, until only one remains standing.  Katniss and Peeta are the tributes from the mining district, District 12.  Katniss is a skilled hunter, and Peeta, the very intelligent son of a baker.  Together, they could be a formidable team against the others.  But caring for a deadly competitor will only make you weaker.  In the end, only one can survive.  Who will live, and who will die?  Does humanity make you weaker or stronger?<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES is everything my family advertised it to be and more - I became so engrossed that I read THE HUNGER GAMES in less than 24 hours.  Author Suzanne Collins has an easy, simple writing style that is still very compelling.  The character development is very strong, and the action is almost immediate and non-stop.  While I can see why early young adults would eat these up, they clearly appeal to a much wider audience.  Katniss and Peeta are both strong, engaging characters; brutal when needed, but still very human in a dark, horrifying world.  The secondary characters are equally poignant, representing both the best and the worst aspects of Katniss and Peeta's world.<br /><br />While this plot is not a new one, THE HUNGER GAMES is so well told that here it feels unique, fresh, and original.  Additionally, while the idea of THE HUNGER GAMES is dark and horrific, it is important to note that there is little gore, no sex, and no bad language.  Ms. Collins manages to pull off THE HUNGER GAMES based her plot and her storytelling alone, not on the commonly used devices mentioned above.  In this day and age, that is really saying something.  Keeping the attention of young teens, creating a buzz among them, selling millions of copy on strength of story alone is no small feat.  And keeping adults enthralled as well elevates Ms. Collins into a very elite category of authors.<br /><br />My 13 year old is still sleeping this morning.  But as soon as she is awake, I will be grabbing the second book.  I can't wait to see what happens next!pects of Katniss and Peeta's world.

1416594795|5.0|It's one of the best books I've read so far about evolution. It's comprehensive and yet goes into enough details to give the reader the understanding that evolution is not an opinion, it's a proper theory based on observed facts. I've read it twice and would gladly read it again.
0312600844|1.0|There was just no way around it: So much critical praise when this novel came out-- I could not help but be informed by all the breathless reviews. Perhaps a greater mind may have been able to filter out this noise. Not me. So, maybe the novel was bound to disappoint. Did it ever. Enough so, that it really made me question the faculties of some of our literary critics.       So, as I persevered through the novel I found myself more and more perplexed. What were the critics thinking? What was Franzen thinking? Why would anyone consider this a masterpiece? Well, I suppose it has the requisite length to pass itself off as an \\"important\\" novel. There is much to find fault with here: clunky transitions,one dimensional characters, Franzen's take on punk rock, the general soapishness of it. I will confine my criticism to Franzen's take on women.      One of the more galling pieces of praise offered was that \\"Franzen gets women\\". Lets consider this. Can you imagine a critic writing \\"Franzen gets men.\\"? No? Of course not. Men of course cannot be \\"summed up\\" in one single novel.  At any rate, getting past the patently offensive conceit of this statement, this begs the question \\"who else would this reviewer say \\"gets\\" women\\"? John \\"Venus and Mars\\" Gray? Any hack writer of Hollywood Romcoms? Budweiser's advertising agency?     In Franzen's world the highest goal for women is to find validation in their men. I will not say that the men are particularly complex-- this would require that Franzen create more fully fleshed out characters. Still, the men tend to have ideals and a \\"higher purpose\\". The women are simply pathetic. Thankfully, they resemble no women I know. Am I really to believe the cause of a 40 something woman's malaise and depression is due to unfinished business with a \\"dangerous' man of her youth. If we are to believe that this woman--Patty-- is intelligent and complex we would have to believe that she could see through Richard Katz's silly posturing. And, ultimately we would have to believe that there is more to her than simply needing a good lay. Ugh!     When I finished this book, I found myself needing to retreat to the 19th century (Yes, the smutty scenes and pop culture touchstones became too much for me) and picked up a novel by Trollope. I found it curious that someone writing over one hundred years ago--someone who would never claim to be a radical-- was able to create more fully realized female characters. Some may not have been likable, but they were certainly the equal of men in intelligence and humor. That this novelist could create such characters, practicing his craft in workmanlike fashion, churning out a prescribed number of words each day while Franzen (as he discussed) took some nine years and struggled to create this doorstop of a novel--well, what does this say?       This novel was pure fluff. I might say that it was instantly forgettable, but the hype surrounding it, and the fact that my feelings were so at odds with all the critical praise made it stick around in my head far longer than it should have. At this point I am many books removed from having read this one, but it still annoys me.
B002NXSRX4|1.0|Seriously.  I guess that the Baroness was good-looking, so the movie wasn't all bad.  But it was close.  All of the characters were ruined, the \\"real American Hero\\" is now less American, the dialogue was horrible, and the comic relief was painful.  It's really as bad as people say it is.  Maybe the pacing was okay?  Until toward the end, when it kept going...  If you like scary movies, then you'll like the end, when they strongly suggest a sequel.
B0035V35P8|5.0|Just watched this movie on TV and I have to have it on DVD to watch and watch and watch.  Action packed and does not disappoint at all.  Rain is hot and was awesome in this movie.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|Best true sci fi film I've seen in a while. Great visuals, dialog, direction, soundtrack, etc. Pretty good story too. Be warned that, as other reviewers have noted, there is a problem with at least some disc/blu ray player combinations which engages some commentary as a PIP box during regular playback. It is extremely annoying. There is no fix available in the menu, however a quick press of the PIP button on your remote will fix the problem. Those of you with players lacking a PIP button (PS3, etc) appear to be screwed. Just sayin...
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This series really needs no review.  Simply put, it is gritty, hard-hitting, in-your-face entertainment that has a great story line and some of the best cast characters ever assembled.  I believe this is a \\"love it or hate it\\" kind of show; it's not for everyone but those of us who love it.... well, we LOVE it!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I had heard about this book, seen it at the bookstores, etc. I bought the sample for my kindle when I got my kindle as a gift, and although the early part of the book was boring as hell, the introduction of Lisbeth Salander was amazing, and the ONLY  reason I bought the full novel. I then watched the Swedish film, and thought OMG...because I didn't realize how violent it would be. That film was well-done (although naturally not as complete as the novel), but I couldn't force myself to read the novel for a while because I was not sure just how \\"complete\\" the novel would be with some of the more violent scenes. Thankfully, I buckled up, and read it, and it was manageable. Not for the squeamish though, although not seriously seriously graphic...I would say the movie is entirely more graphic (by nature of the visual medium), but the book is manageable. I really enjoyed the book quite a bit, and highly recommend it. Also am very curious about the film 're-do' by Hollywood.
0375842381|2.0|This trilogy starts off very well.  The problem is the completely unconvincing ending. For one thing, the most interesting character suddenly has a change of heart with little motivation.  For another, it turns out the grand prophecy that runs throughout the trilogy has a really lame and uncompelling manifestation.  If you feel you must read this to see what the fuss is about, get it from the library because you won't want to read it more than once.
142212312X|3.0|I enjoy Drucker's work and writings and usually have no complaints.  However, this is a pamphlet, not a book.  It is a mere 57 pages and it actually fits in my back pocket.  I didn't read the description very well and thought I was getting a great deal -- a Drucker tome for under $10.  This is definitely good, high-quality Drucker -- just in bite size.
B00319ECC4|4.0|Loved FF for many years and though this is not as good as a whole compared to 'Demanufacture' or 'Archetype' it is a very good disc. BRUTAL is the word that comes to mind as this is FF's heaviest to date. With Gene Hoglan now behind the kit, that doesnt surprise. He is a master drummer with a wicked double bass that fits FF nicely. And though the Drums were always excellent in this band, Hoglan really finds a way to add heaviness to all the bands he plays with and FF are no exception to that rule. The production and mix definitely lean in a 'Drum Heavy' sound.<br /><br />The return of Dino and the sound of his project Divine Heresy come through a bit in the form of straight heaviness, but it is really classic FF throughout. Shiny, clear production aside, these songs are killer. Maybe a bit too heavy in spots to be honest.<br /><br />I wont break down all songs, but they all have that trademark heavy FF sound. Chugging riffs, rifle sounding drums and Burton Bell screaming out the lyrics. Some decent layered harmony vocals in some songs choruses. Think FF on steroids with a great mix and furious double bass drumming with faster, almost 'blast' beats here and there.<br /><br />The last 2 tracks I could do without honestly. Thats why it gets its 4 rating. The first being a 1:30 intro and the other is 'Final Exit' which is a spacey, melodic track that isnt bad, but a real strange way to end such a heavy disc with the piano and soft singing. Reminiscent of the horrible 'Echo of my Scream' from 'Transgression'. Does have its heavy spots, but it doesn't do much except make you scratch your head and wonder. Fear Factory has done excellent melodic songs in the past but this isnt a good fit after such a brutal beating from the rest. The other 8 of 10 tracks are very good, heavy FF. I almost took a star off because its really only 9 tracks without the 1:30 intro piece. Even the  standard version should have more music than that these days.<br /><br />BUT, the absolute best track, and quite possibly one of the bands best ever, is 'Christploitation'. Incredible song. Has all the elements of the band. The creepy vibe, the machinery sounds, the catchy yet dark hook on the piano and incredible drums. Burton Bell spits the lyrics out with venom. The last minute of this track just explodes! It builds to an intense screaming vocal and crushing double bass. This track should have been the title of the CD as it is much better than the title track. Absolutely the best on here and they should have built the entire disc around it. Its blistering, memorable and dark. Co-written by Hoglan (the master of anti-Christian lyrics from the Dark Angel days, so I assume he wrote the lyrics). Has a great vibe, very 'Freedom of Fire'-esqu (from Obsolete). This song itself is worth the price of the disc and saved the solid 4 rating.<br /><br />If you like FF's heavier side get it without hesitation. 8/10 tracks are very good. If you will download just a track or 2, definitely include 'Christploitation' in your downloading.he bands best ever, is 'Christploitation'. Incredible song. Has all the elements of the band.

B0043GAZYS|5.0|I was trying to think of a more manly word to describe my feelings about Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, but all I could come up with was \\"delightful.\\" There. I said it. I was delighted. Not since Amelie have I felt like this about a movie. Is it the best movie I've ever seen? Naw . . . Unforgiven still has that honor. But I smiled or laughed all the way through this one and that's worth something. This movie will no doubt do well on DVD/Blu-Ray, ala Donnie Darko (no, I'm not comparing content, just sales in-theater vs. DVD).
B003XOAJ7E|1.0|Using my original 1986 recording of Notorious as a starting off point, I have to wonder what they were thinking when they decided to not only kill the bass, but make it nearly impossible to feel the bass with the bass turned up all the way on this 2010 3 disc \\"remastered\\" mini box set as it comes in a box with 3 separate disc sleeves for the 2 audio cd's and the region 0 DVD.<br /><br />The rest of the package is obviously aimed at female fans as there are several box sized hard paper backed color photos of the individual main (3) band members and (2) color photos of the 3 guys together and a fold out small b/w poster that doesn't use the same frosted lens filter affect of the main cover motif.<br /><br />Disc 1: is the most disappointing because I wasted over $20 for this set and I assumed incorrectly that the bass would be at the very least improved over the original release from 1986, but it wasn't, I kept listening to all the songs because I thought it might be a one song mistake where the mix copy was turned down or the mastering process was intentional made flat on the equalization boards.<br /><br />The only recovery if you can call it recovery, are the (4) 7\\" version songs at the end, for some reason which I can't verify because I've never owned the 7\\" 45's, is the recording level sounds a bit better than the previous 10 songs that have had their bass level neutered.<br /><br />Disc 2: is sort of superfluous as these recordings are from 12\\" remix versions and as anyone who is familiar with 12\\" recordings, they are made thicker because they are played in clubs and they need to stand up to hundreds of replays, so therefore, the groove density is designed to maintain a higher output over the life of the record, all of that aside, I expected these recordings to be of a higher out put, and they are, nothing surprising about that, except that they decided that their flagship recording required a neutering of the bass and since I never has these disc 2 recordings either, I have no reference to determine if these recordings were turned down on the bass as well.<br /><br />I have just one minor gripe about the 2nd disc as the last 5 songs are live recordings, and this is something I've had a beef with Simon over many years, not so much him personally, but some of his personal views rub me the wrong way.<br /><br />At the start of \\"new religion\\" he says, \\"it's something we all need right now, is a new religion\\", so I ask, with over 15,000 religions in the world of humans, Simon Lebon thinks it's a good idea to make a religious statement before a song and he basically insults the beliefs of his audience by assuming that established religions are no good, because he thinks that a good segue for his song is to promote the idea that 15,000+ deities in our human world isn't enough, we need one more?<br /><br />The DVD is pretty good as I've never seen them live, it's hard to tell if this show from their 87-88 tour was comparable to their previous or later shows as I've never seen anything but the included music videos before, but I will have to say, the Brazilian dancers that appeared on stage before Duran Duran came on, where much more exciting to watch, than Duran Duran.<br /><br />I take that back, the band played adequately for a Duran Duranesque cover band, but the show they put on didn't strike me as unique or special enough to make me eager to see them live in person, mayebe I'm too much of a perfectionist, maybe it was just a mediocre performance, again, I have nothing to compare this DVD to, but then again, their top of the pops performance looked and sounded too obviously lip-synced to be a memorable performance, that is, if these performances have to be better than a Milli Vanilli concert to be considered adequate lip-sync performances.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard fan, maybe you want the extras, maybe you make the effort to complain to EMI for the bass neutering of the original 10 song line-up of Notorious, but that'sjust me.<br /><br />If you hold the opinion that I do, better hold on to those 1986 recordings of Notorious until EMI figures out how to remaster a 24 year old recording using current technology, for all the stuff EMI produces, I'm at a loss as to why they killed the bass on the original 10 song line-up, the only logical excuse might be less distortion if played very loud, because the bass is almost non-existent compared to the super remastering like that done on ELP's first album in 2007, the bass is adequate to my satisfaction on a DDD recording from 1986.1986 recordings of Notorious until EMI figures out how to remaster a 24 year old recording using current technology, for all the stuff EMI produces, I'm at a

B003YUC2FE|3.0|Most reviewers have gone on and on about the bad packaging. But honestly I don't know what all the fuss is about. The foam takes perfect care of the discs. A box set like this isn't for children, it's for serious film lovers and collectors. I happen to have children and have no problem putting the most often used discs in a slimline case for the kids. A big cube of slimlines is super cheap online and it is ultimately temporary. It would be way worse if the discs got loose and bounced around the box during shipping, moving etc. the way I've seen other cheap box sets do. My only complaint about the packaging is it's so much bigger than it needs to be. The reason CDs, DVDs and other disc-based formats were great to begin with is that they can take up *less* space on the shelf and waste less cardboard, plastic what have you. To be honest I really don't care about fancy packaging and it should be as small and economical as possible (both in shelf space and the afore-mentioned resources) because what's most important is the *content*.    Which brings me to my main point. I had the original Toy Box on DVD but I wanted to upgrade all my Pixar films to Bluray. Unfortunately for me, I didn't fully read all the reviews before going out and purchasing this box. The original Toy Box had awesome bonus materials and I assumed that since Pixar has always put out such great releases that this new ultimate Toy Box would include all of the original material plus anything new they've whipped up for 1 and 2 plus all the new stuff for 3. Not so with this one and that was the biggest disappointment for me. Had I researched more diligently before I would have just bought TS3 on Bluray and been done with it until a future release contained everything.    Having said all that, at the current Amazon prices, it is a good bargain for anyone looking to get all 3 movies in one whack. I had a gift card to BB and in store it was $80 which is totally not worth it but Amazon's $60 is very good. Hencethe 3 stars. The movies are spectacular, they were made for Bluray. This set has all of them for those that have none. But minus 2 stars for not making it a true Ultimate Toy Box for us geeks by not including all the past material. I'm ultimately at peace with my purchase as it was my own fault for not researching more fully, I just hope this review better informs the next person in the same situation.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Ponyo is perfect for children, and I'm not even a Miyazaki fan. I thought both [[ASIN:B00003CXBK Princess Mononoke]] and [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]] were drawn out and excessively grotesque. But Ponyo is perfect. It finds a tone that is rare and priceless in children's movies. On one hand, it has a strong dramatic side, with exciting magical transformations and intense forces of nature. On the other hand, there is no antagonist, nobody in the film is evil. Ponyo's strict father is never really scary. His visual design makes him look like a stage magician or an eccentric inventor; it's easy to see that he's essentially kind. All the other characters are unreservedly good, even the grumpy old lady at the nursing home.    Sure, at some point your kids will grow older, and then you'll have to teach them that the world isn't always (or ever) like this. For example, at some point you might show them [[ASIN:B00006HAWP Grave Of The Fireflies]]. But when they're really young, Ponyo is what they really need. There's enough action and adventure, so this isn't Barney, and some of the visuals are unworldly enough to keep the movie from being a syrupy cute-fest. But there's no fighting or cruelty, and the underlying message is decent and good for children. To find something else with those qualities, you'd have to go back to the old [[ASIN:0374350302 Moominland]] books.    Additionally, the protagonist Sosuke is a fine example for children. He's not entirely quiet and obedient, but he loves both his parents very much. Even at his age, he already has a nascent sense of obligation. Adults talk to him in a way that makes him feel grown-up and responsible, asking him to protect his mother. He admires and tries to emulate his father (and there is a father -- he may be absent, but he works hard for his family). Lastly, he is admirably brave, venturing forth over a submerged seascape and into a dark tunnel and overcoming his fears.    You can still see some of the rough edges thatare present in all of Miyazaki's work. The storyline is a little loose. Why exactly does it upset the balance of the universe when a little goldfish decides to be human? I would have thought that the piles of underwater trash would do more harm in that regard. And what is exactly is the test that Sosuke is supposed to pass? We only see him going through the tunnel. Sosuke's father is transported to a strange place with countless other lost ships, but nothing is really ever made of this place, and he easily returns at the end. But in this film, all that might actually be for the best. All we really need to know is that Sosuke perceives that his father might be in danger and that he has to be responsible. Whether or not there is any actual danger is beside the point.    Miyazaki's grotesque side also shows through when Ponyo grows ungainly chicken-like stick arms. But this, again, is temporary, and she gains a completely human appearance very shortly afterward. Quite harmless, compared to the half-hour long sequence of the masked being vomiting black goo in Spirited Away. It's eclipsed by the number of majestic visual set-pieces, like the colourful underwater parade at the beginning or Ponyo's chase after Sosuke (riding a school of giant liquid fish, no less) after becoming human.    Ponyo herself is an old archetype of children's literature, the Magical Friend who is more powerful, outgoing and fun than the protagonist, yet utterly devoted to him, and often lacking in direction, only reaching her potential in the protagonist's presence (Astrid Lindgren had a lot of those characters -- recall [[ASIN:0142402494 Pippi]] and [[ASIN:0192727729 Karlson]]). She does most of the work helping Sosuke find his mother, but only because Sosuke supplies the determination. She doesn't have a lot of personality other than enjoying ham, but again, this helps to make Sosuke responsible for his own decisions.    You go through a dark tunnel, and at the end your father comes home and your mother gives you a hug and makes dessert for you, and even the unfriendly wizard turns out to be a fundamentally nice guy who even asks you to try to remember him warmly. As long as you love your parents and protect your friends, everything will turn out fine. All the time mankind spent making art and poetry, and that's still the purest image anyone ever came up with. You want your kids to grow up to be decent people, this is the first step.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I have decided to give this DVD set a 5 star for the fact that the cinementography and virtual computer effects are superb. I am only into the first disc of four episodes and already a fan of this series.  After watching \\"Rome\\" series I became interested in more action from this period in history.  \\"Rome\\" is an outstanding production of the Roman Empire with a clear storyline and characters you can easily connect with.  \\"Spartacus\\" on the other hand is focused on just that - Spartacus; who is the central character with a continuous storyline of his plight.  They both have no lack of imagination though, and also there is no lack of censoring of any kind - very graphic depictions of violence, sex, and profanity.  This is definatley not for tame eyes and ears.  I highly recommend this to those who love to sit back and watch a nice love story and a good old fashioned action filled bludgeoning.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love love love Jillian. I have tried other trainers but her method of a shorter yet more intense workout with no breaks, really put my body under the pressure it needs to change. I have been using this dvd for 2wks now and I have lost inches and I am noticeably stronger already. Get this DVD.
B003Y8YXFS|1.0|It pains me to give a john lennon product a 1 star rating, but it needs to be done. The remix from 2000 sounds so much better. Not to mention, the remastering from the original tapes really isn't that noticeable. If you compare your original cd's from the 1980's there isn't much of a difference. I'm aware these are the original sound recordings, but it seems like this is a step in the wrong direction. The remixes are true to the orginal recording, but the voice and instruments are brought out more. This really wasn't necessary. I only bought it because my friend got me a discount on the signature box set.
0553385461|5.0|An exuberant exploration of the big questions of the cosmos in layman's terms.  This book should be required reading for all high school students.
B003Y8YXEO|1.0|It pains me to give a John Lennon release a 1 star rating, but this whole re-issue program is a waste of money and a step in the wrong direction. The remastering is average at best. I compared some of the tracks to the original cd's from the 1980's and there is barely a difference. I also think the re-mixes from the 2000's are far superior. I'm not sure why she didn't just release stripped only. This really was a cash grab. I find it hard to believe. Skip this.
0061353248|4.0|I'd come across some anecdotes from this book before so was looking forward to some seriously good tools to use in marketing our services.  However, whilst there were some, this book is more social science than business.  If you're looking for a more practical business guide, this is not it, but it is still recommended as an excellent insight into human behaviour that can be used in many spheres of business.  Here are the 6 points I found most usable:    1. As the title suggests, people's decisions are irrational rather than calculated, but the author suggests these decisions are actually predictable.    2. Relativity is key.  People make choices by comparing options subconsciously and you can guide these decisions by providing the right alternatives.    3. Supply and demand is not the determinant of price.  People tend to determine what they'll pay for something based on the initial price they paid or what they see others pay (anchoring).    4. Free is incredibly powerful and people will change their purchasing behaviours if they can get something free (even if the ultimate cost to them is higher).    5. Money is not the only currency - people do things for social rewards too and in fact this is often more powerful.  Just be careful how you use them to avoid an emotional backlash to actions you think are simply business.    6.  People's experiences are shaped by their expectations.  If you know what brand of drink is in your glass, your opinion of it changes.  If you tell someone an experience is going to be unpleasant, they won't enjoy it (whereas they may have been OK with it without the negative expectations).    I recommend you buy it (but the points above are just my own opinion and I may have misunderstood some of the research OK?)
B0044430H8|5.0|WOW. THIS MUSIC ENHANCED THIS MOVIE A LOT. I DARE SAY THAT THIS MOVIE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS GOOD WITHOUT THIS MUSIC BECAUSE I REALLY FEEL THAT WAY. I'M NOT A PERSON WHO LIKES INSTRUMENTALS, BUT THIS IS SIMPLY AWESOME. IT GIVES ME CHILLS. JOB WELL DONE TRENT. JOB WELL DONE.
B003VIW8DU|4.0|Bryan Ferry's last solo album \\"Dylanesque\\" recorded during a break in the making of the album that ultimately became \\"Olympia\\" gave us a glimpse of Bryan's voice--it sounded frayed and torn but with his distinctive delivery and phrasing as a vocalist in tact. While Bryan doesn't quite sound as good on \\"Olympia\\" as on the 2002 release \\"Frantic\\", the music itself is as seductive and inviting as ever.<br /><br />\\"Olympia\\" finds Ferry along with long time producer Rhett Davies refining the sophisticated groove orientated sound of \\"Boys and Girls\\" and \\"Avalon\\" bringing it into the 21st century. The songs have an etheral floating quality to them complimented by guests David Gilmour, Phil Manzanera, Johnny Greenwood, Nile Rodgers and Chris Spedding on guitar as well as Brian Eno (playing sythesizer) and Andy Mackay helping to fill out the layered production/sound of the album.<br /><br />Eight original songs by Ferry plus two remakes - Traffic's \\"No Face, No Name, No Number\\" and a lovely take on Tim Buckley's \\"Song for the Siren\\" that compliment and fit in very well with Ferry's original songs including \\"BF Bass\\" a collaboration with long time Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera.<br /><br />The main problem here (as with a lot of CDs) is the mastering by Bob Ludwig--it's compressed and too loud although it isn't fatiguing as many recent CDs. I realize that Ludwig is doing what he's told but, really, I keep hoping that the madness of over compressed loud, harsh recordings will stop.<br /><br />The deluxe edition features a 28 minute documentary on the making of the album produced and directed by Issac Ferry, a music video for \\"You Can Dance\\". The CD includes two bonus tracks including an unusual cover of John Lennon's \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night\\" and \\"One Night\\".<br /><br />The two disc set comes in a nicely designed CD case sized hardcover book with lyrics.<br /><br />This isn't a return to the early Roxy Music sound that many fans were hoping for after Roxy's tours but it's a strong, elegantly/sounding/produced album. Although Ferry's voice isn't in top form here, his delivery and the songs make this a very good album for fans to pick up.<br /><br />Recommended.duced album. Although Ferry's voice isn't in top form here, his delivery and the songs make this a very good album for fans to pick up.    Recommended.
B003O7I6L6|1.0|I just saw this film for the first time. I have heard it was pretty good, but certainly don`t agree with that. Too little<br />action. I think the film also was too slow. Carpenter could have trimmed 5-10 minutes of scenes. I didn`t care for<br />the story either. I will not see this again. I regret i bought it. The sequel that i also bought, is probably also lousy.<br />Very disappointing.<br /><br />Picture Quality: 3.5/5<br /><br />This was a very dark film, so not very many scenes that looks detailed and sharp. It could have been restored<br />better. I think they should have turned up the brightness a bit, so we could see things clearer. It`s too dark.<br /><br />Audio Quality: 3.5/5<br /><br />I was not so impressed by the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. I think most of the gunfire effects could have had more<br />clarity and bass. I think this audio track could have been remixed better.<br /><br />Film: 1/5<br />Overall: 1/5

B000FZETIO|5.0|Probably my favorite John Hughes film, and that really is saying something. I love this movie lots. If you haven't seen it, you need to.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I'm primarily interested in the storyline differences between special sets and their theatrical counterparts, so here are the differences between the two (NOTE: SPOILERS FOLLOW).    The extended collector's edition runs 16 minutes 28 seconds longer than the theatrical cut, and listed below are the major differences.    1)  The opening scene is different, and starts with Jake in a wheelchair on Earth, in a Blade Runner-esque Earth city.  The scene moves to scenes of Jake in his apartment, then taking liquid shots in a bar.  Jake's narration of \\"I told myself I can pass any test a man can pass\\" and \\"They can fix the spinal if you got the money. But not on vet benefits, not in this economy\\" are inserted during this new opening scene.    Jake beats up a bar patron who is mistreating a woman, and then Jake and wheelchair are unceremoniously thrown outside by bouncers into an alley.  While in the alley, Jake meets the two RDA representatives who bring him news of his brother's untimely death.  Then the movie cuts back to the original theatrical cut where Jake sees his brother's body cremated, then awakes in space.      2)  During Jake's initial flyover of Pandora in his avatar, they witness a herd of Sturmbeasts, buffalo-like creatures.    3)  After seeing the Sturmbeasts, Grace, Jake, and Norm stop by Grace's old English school for the Na'vi.  The school is now closed, abandoned, and some walls are riddled with bullet-holes.  Norm finds a Dr. Seuss book, \\"The Lorax\\", on the ground.  This scene explains how Neytiri knew English so well, and certainly gives some further backstory into Grace Augustine's character.    Interestingly, The Lorax can be seen as a metaphor for the Pandoran story.  Recall that the seemingly simple Seussian book is actually a lesson on the plight of the environment and industrialization.    4)  We see some other different Pandoran flora and fauna, particularly with scenes of the luminescent forest floor.    5)  Jake's first dinner with Neytiri is longer and extended, and it's here that she tells him her full name.    6)  When Jake, Grace, and Norm first visit the Hallelujah Mountains on the way to the remote uplink station, Grace explains (in a Jake voiceover) that the mountains are levitated [via the Meissner Effect], because Unobtanium is a superconductor.  There's a pretty spectacular CGI shot as the characters look around in awe at the suspended mountains.    7)  Pictures of Grace and Na'vi children at her previously functioning school.  Dr. Augustine tells Jake that she previously taught Neytiri and her sister, Sylwanin.  However, one day, Sylwanin and some hunters destroyed an RDA bulldozer, and RDA SecOps troopers killed them at the school, which explains why the school walls were previously seen pockmarked with bullet holes.      8)  Sturmbeast hunting scene after Jake tames a Banshee.  After Jake successfully kills a Sturmbeast with an arrow, he and Neytiri chortle a \\"Heck yeah!\\" and whoop.    9)  Jake and Neytiri's love scene comprises them linking braids together.  Some kissing, nothing explicit.    10)  Tsu'tey leads a war party that destroys the RDA's autonomous bulldozers, as well as the RDA SecOps squad that was guarding them.  Corporal Wainfleet leads the search party that uncovers the evidence, via real-time helmet cam footage.  Not sure why they cut this scene from the theatrical cut, as it persuades Selfridge to attack the Home Tree.    11)  Attack of Hammerhead Titanotheres on RDA forces has been extended slightly; additional scenes of AMP-Suits getting destroyed.    12)  Fight between Colonel Quaritch in AMP Suit and Neytiri on Thanator slightly longer.    13)  Tsu'tey's death scene; in the theatrical cut, he falls off the RDA shuttle's aft ramp to his death.  In the Collector's Edition, he falls to the forest floor, mortally wounded.  He passes on leadership to Jake, and asks Jake to ceremonially kill him e.g. hara-kiri, so that Jake will be the last shadow that Tsu-Tey sees.  Jake doesso.    I preferred the original Tsu'tey death scene, which was more dramatic.  Jake, had afterall, already become the de facto clan leader by that point in the movie, so further formal transfer by Tsu'tey (a minor character) seemed unnecessary.
B000LBBLO2|4.0|I had no problem with the quality of the item. With the price that it has it was well worth it. The only thing that I find not so great is that it din't came with that 3D cover. It would of been nice to have that since that's what I thought I purchased. But again with the price so low I really didn't mind at all. Great item!

B003ITZBVS|5.0|Batman: Under the Red Hood is an intriguing look at the mind of Batman. After a new crime lord starts taking control of Gotham City, Batman must face his own greatest personal failure and its consequences years after the fact. He must also answer some deeply personal questions, specifically why he never kills his enemies, but especially the Joker. The answer he gives is one which anyone who has ever had dark impulses can appreciate. The film also raises questions such as can one ever truly stop crime, or is the best one can hope to do control it? On top of all these interesting ideas, the film has brilliant voice acting and animation, and really creates the appropriate dark and moody feel from the first scene in which Robin is brutally beaten to death by the Joker. Seriously, if you are a fan of Batman, check this one out.
B00004U8P9|4.0|5 copies of this movie are Christmass gifts.  I have not seen any of them.  I received 3 in the original purchase and had to ask for 2 more to complete the purchase.  2 more arrived quickly but I don't dnot about the quality as they're gifts to be given.
B002ZG999U|1.0|It's pretty sad when the only good thing about a movie is Mickey Roarke. This movie is just bad. So much violence it makes no sense after awhile. And there is no attempt at any sort of realism. Not one of the commandoes ever uses a silenced weapon. They would all be deaf. There is a scene where the whole team is running through a huge building setting C-4 charges... hundreds of them! But yet not one of them is carrying a backpack! Where were all those charges coming from?  It's all just plain silly.     I would have forgiven all this, if there had been even a semblance of a script. The guy-love banter, which is supposed to be funny and touching, is contrived and idiotic. The characters are dopey, and there is not NEARLY enough of Dolph Lundgren.      OK, I am a woman, but my husband, who was an Army Ranger, thought it was a dumbest movie he ever saw. We were both deaf by the end of it. I wish I had brought earplugs, unlike any of the movie characters. Did Stallone even TALK to a special forces team?    Mickey Roarke, however, was the only believable character with the only backstory even approaching something real. You could see the human devastation in his face... even though you know it really came from a lifetime of drugs and alcohol. Who cares? It was at least real.    The only funny joke with the Schwarzenegger scene, all of 6 minutes. Watch it on YouTube.    Stallone, stop writing your own movies! And stop starring in them! Just STOP!    Go see RED instead.
0553805371|4.0|This is a very fine explication of what the authors (and modern physicists) understand as reality and the nature of the universe. It was very well written although it would take a physics expert to understand the details; it was, for the most part, quite comprehensible considering the complexity of the concepts. Such matters as M-theory, Quantum Mechanics. string theory and the behavior of quarks would be useful. Nonetheless, this book introduced to me the notion of multiple universes as well as the authors' explanation of why no creator is necessary to explain the nature of the universe and universal laws. It is the first scientific book I have that makes that assertion in the name of science.<br /><br />Stephen Hawking is arguably the most brilliant man in the world. He and his co-author have brought a bit more light into my life. I enjoyed their book very much.

B004C5K3FG|2.0|This episode sure seemed pretty hacked to me. Clark saves Tess from battling Granny Goodness's soldiers, and suddenly he's back at the farm looking for Lois. What happened with the Orphanage? Did they just leave all the kids there? What about the little girl he left in the electrical room? If we're to assume they did call authorities and shut it down, how did Granny escape? Tess is trying to dial for help on an old rotary phone in the Orphanage. They have all this cutting-edge technology in the Watch Tower, but she doesn't have a cell phone? Why would granny leave the ballerina music box in Tess's room when she could have, oh, I don't know, grabbed Tess instead?  Huge holes abound.    I'm a fan of the series, but man, this episode was a mess.
B0000797IO|3.0|Was very surprised at the way this movie plays out.  Shows how real life can get out of hand so very easily.
142311339X|4.0|This first book in the sequel series to the Percy Jackson books takes place about 4 months after the end of the Last Olympian. There are new main characters, and (obviously) a new problem that needs to be solved. Jason finds himself in a place he doesn't know, with no memory and two friends who swear they've been best friends all year. The new trio finds their way to Camp Half Blood and almost immediately sets off on their quest to save the world. Each one learns about the power of friendship as well as about who they are, what they believe, and what kind of person they want to be. This really is a great book with a lot of Riordan's humorous prose that makes you laugh out loud.<br />The frustrating part comes in when Riordan hints at Percy, barely touches on Annabeth, and only involves Thalia a little bit in the story. Annabeth shows up at the beginning, and throughout the whole book everyone talks about Percy, but you don't find out what happened to him until the end. And then you're just left worrying about what his experience has been like for the time frame of this book, and won't possibly be able to find out until the next is released next fall. A minor problem, considering this series is supposed to be about a different set of characters, but a frustrating one all the same if you love the original Percy Jackson characters.<br />Really, this is an amazing book for people of all ages if you like to laugh out loud when you're reading, and enjoy a good adventure story!
B000000WG4|2.0|I was disappointed with this cd.  The only section I had ever heard was the \\"Exorcist\\" music.  The remaining content is not the same and falls far short.  I was not able to find a \\"listen to samples\\" link for this cd.  If I had, I would not have made this selection.
B003539QKO|4.0|This album is an obvious departure to what everyone knows 'Lil Wayne' for- that is, his unique rap vocals mixed with his hard-edged 'explicit' and sometimes extremely sexual lyrics.  His creativity and talent is undeniable as he completely flips the script with his eccentric, yet vividly emotional collaboration with other well known artists. The tracks recorded for this album should be put into it's own genre, in my humble opinion.      He unabashedly has shown the world that he is most definitely not afraid to rap 'outside the box' and cross the lines of the 'hard-rap' hip-hop persona he has diligently constructed since 1992, by rocking out.    Even though this is not what the fan-base/demographic would expect from Lil Wayne, he has infinitely impressed me with his ability to be diverse. He could have quite possibly have opened a new audience's ear canals with his funky, obnoxious rock-rap medley.  People should hopefully open their minds and hearts to Lil Wayne's eclectic experiment.    Different and awesome- it's a \\"Knockout\\"!
B003L77GGK|5.0|We started watching this series to help my husband expand his English vocabulary with something mindless and somewhat simple, but entertaining.  Of course, all immigrants need to learn such critical vocabulary as werewolf, poltergeist, etc.<br /><br />What my husband said is this is the only horror genre that attempts to maintain a logic.  Dizzy girls don't (usually) follow a bloody killer deeper into a dark and scary house or forest while screaming and shaking. The series tries to maintain an internal logic and set of physics logic for the alternative worlds the mere mortals engage in and they even leave room for things they don't know -- telling a ghost they don't actually know where the ghosts go after they salt and burn the bones.<br /><br />This series is a guilty pleasure -- fun to watch!
B002ZG993Q|3.0|Too slow and downright boring at times.  It gave George Clooney the opportunity to film in his beloved Italy, and granted, the scenery was lovely.  Trying way too hard and possibly nostalgically to reproduce that '70s film effect.  Where were the police in Italy when everyone was getting shot up as in an old spaghetti western?
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Government pensioner Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) lives a dull life in a quiet suburb of Cleveland.  His principal amusement is romancing a bored pension clerk named Sarah (a superbly cast Mary Louise Parker) over the phone.  One night, a squad of black-ops agents breaks in.  Frank mops the floor with them, revealing astonishing black-ops skills of his own.  On the run, he kidnaps the rather willing Sarah.  Turns out Frank Moses is \\"retired-extremely dangerous\\" and the CIA, for some reason, wants him dead.<br /><br />Frank hunts up some old comrades (Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren) to find out why they are all being targeted.  Frank will also get help from an old Russian adversary (Brian Cox) and an old records keeper (Earnest Borgnine in one of his last film roles).  Frank and his buddies will have to stay one step ahead the very capable young CIA operative William Cooper (Karl Urban).<br /><br />At the heart of the story is a ridiculously complicated and hilarious plot full of black helicopters and corrupt officials.  The fun is in watching a nicely matched collection of gifted actors roll through an action-comedy while reeling off Cold War jokes, clich&eacute;s, and sight gags.  Highly recommended as good fun.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|My wife & daughter love this movie and make a point of finding it on TV during the holidays. Last year I hunted all over town for a copy for Christmas with no luck. So this year I went to Amazon plenty early to make sure I could get it. They will be delighted when it shows up as an \\"early\\" Xmas present.   I'm no movie critic; I have not opened the package yet; and I hope the problem one reviewer had with getting it to play on his/her TV does not happen to me.  Delivery was fast & timely with no issues at all.
0525951652|5.0|This was a stupendous book which has just started a long journey.  Can't wait for the next book.  Left me wishing it was twice as long so that all of the storylines good have been more detailed.  The characters are so real and their stories are so engrossing that it left me wanting to know so much more.  I would like to pre-order the next volume now!
0312370849|3.0|This book is written as two separate stories that join together later.  The story of Sarah takes place in 1942 and is very well written and easily kept my interest.  The story of Julia takes place in 2002 and was not enjoyable. For most of the book it flips back and forth between the two stories every other chapter.  This was not good for me. I ended up skipping the Julia chapters completely and just reading the story of Sarah because I couldn't stand the senseless drama of Julia's current day life.  I thumbed through the ending of the book to see how they tied together but I didn't exactly read the entire book because other than the story of Sarah, the book did not hold my attention. It's not common for me to not read an entire book (I'm an avid reader) but I could not get  myself to read this entire book.  I think it had a lot of potential but it just didn't do it for me.
B00498YZH8|5.0|Stubborn as hell people in a hard environment. Poverty breeds strange practices valued as needful by some of the old hill folks. The old hill values with stills and moonshine now in the guise of meth labs and coke.    The drugs took a back burner as to points to observe in this movie--no pun intended. The rawness, the deep roots of home, of friendship, of family make the tough binding of a culture of an all but forgotten people.
0061730335|5.0|This is the incredible story of a young man in Malawi (east coast of Africa) who could not afford to go back to school at age 15 because of  his parents inability to pay for his h.s. tuition (about $15!)  due to shortage of funds from famine and where his life went from there! I read it before going on a mission trip to Malawi this fall to work with the MInistry of Hope there whose goal is to serve the orphans and widows of Malawi ... and then I read it again on my return! It shows the amazing perseverance of a 15 year old who was so devastated at not being allowed to return to school and how he  decided on his own to read all the books in the village library to keep up his  skills so as not to fall too far behind. In his endeavor to better himself and try not to let his brain totally atrophy, he found and read a physics book and decided to try and build a windmill to generate electricity for his family. The story is absolutely the most uplifting and inspiring thing I have read since THREE CUPS OF TEA! I shall not spoil the story but besides detailing the life of William and his experiences with searching the dump for scraps with which to complete his project, it paints a very realistic picture of this tiny country in east Africa. Malawi won independence from Great Britain in 1964 and struggles still with the problems of poverty, high infant death, low life expectancy, as well as a low family income (average $255) due to being mostly an agricultural country where most families still exist on subsistence farming. And yet the spirit of the people whom I met there in person and thru the reading the book is just awesome! They are the most faith-filled and joy-filled people I have met who refuse to be beaten down by their circumstances and continue to make progress little by little. I would love this book to be part of every h.s. literature course here in the States as it's such a contrast with so many students here who simply take their gift of a free education totallyfor granted. I cannot recommend it highly enough! :-)
1878424602|5.0|The well touted \\" Secret\\" was taken from the knowledge in this book.  This book is the real thing. It gives you what the secret does not. Deepak Chopra  is without a doubt an inspiration to those on a spiritual path. He is tops and so is this book.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|Size and weight is great, button layout is awesome, I like all the textures, and can live with the idiosyncracies of using a USB-based wireless receiver like having to turn on the PS3 directly. However, the dead zones are, in fact, -HUGE- on my controller, and it just plays crappy. I'm somewhat more comfortable on this controller, but a significantly smoother player on the default PS3 controller, so this one loses.
B001UV4XWY|1.0|The concept of this movie may have been good, but the musical score drove me to turn it off! This is what happens when an artistic attitude takes over. The music was completely off with timing and had no relevance at all! It was really annoying, so much so that I couldn't finish it.<br />[[ASIN:1589825918 Self Convictions]]<br />[[ASIN:B003SNJYM6 Self Consciousness]]
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent book, well researched and well written. Tremendous amount of effort went into researching this women's story and Skloot should be rewarded for her efforts. The story is gripping and the facts are both interesting and somewhat unsettling, bringing to light many ethical issues of science research--past, present, and for the future.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|A friend showed me a youtube video back in September of this band that I never heard of. The video was Little Lion Man and from the get go I was enthralled by the music- a blend of folk, blue grass, rock, little country twang to boot- it wasn't just the sound of the acoustic and banjo and cello, but the lyrics itself that Mumford and Sons were saying, so beautiful and deep. I then started looking up more songs on Youtube and liking each one more and more! This is true music to me, the band pouring heart and soul into their songs, lyrics and meaning can be interpreted to one's life's ups and downs, love, loss, redemption. That is how I viewed it, from Roll Away Your Stone to The Cave to Awake my Soul (my favorite song on the album). I then immediately ordered their album \\"Sigh No More\\" and the CD is in my car where I play it over and over. I cannot say enough good things about their first album! If you you have an affinity for beautiful, down to earth, no commercialized music, where true music roots go deep to your soul and affect you in some profound way, listen to this band! I hope to see these guys live sometime if they ever come to New England!
B0044IJ1S6|4.0|As with previous live releases from my favorite band for over 25 years, I'd been waiting for this with much anticipation.  Because DM and their music have been part of two thirds of my life, it was difficult not to enjoy and relive my experience and their music thru this video.  However, I have to say that I was highly dissappointed that two of the tracks I was most interested in (Strangelove and Master & Servant)were excluded.  It had been almost 20 years since I last heard them live during the Violator tour. Of course, that concert still remains to be released.  I'll have to settle for the CD tracks I have to continue to enjoy these awesome versions of these tracks.  The deluxe Blue Ray offered excellent interviews and added tracks and videos.  It was bitter sweet to watch since the reality that DM is maturing and may not be around for much longer, was evident.  I hope that next time they tour, they focus on some of their earlier yet more obscure tracks like \\"Something to do\\", \\"But not tonight\\", \\"I want you now\\", and \\"Rush\\"!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|this book was a blast to read. i would recommend it to any person above the age 8. i love the way rick riordan details the fighting  parts. my favorite part was when sadie and carter fought set. BUY THIS BOOK!

038533348X|4.0|A brilliant novel capitalizing on that hidden layer of life in which the Creator has subtly and mysteriously connected everyone to someone else. It begins with the writer of a story and culminates in the end of all life on Earth. I wasn't enraptured with the text so much as I was driven to greater depths of curiosity for what came next, two-pages at a time.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I have never encountered so many whiners on one page before. When the regular DVD without special features came out, James Cameron went on camera saying that this did not have the special features and that it would come out again WITH special features in November.     Also, I for one DO appreciate the different versions. I would not have wanted to wait until November to watch Avatar as much as I wanted. As a Mass Communications Major, I know how long it takes to do even the simplest amount of editing so I know these guys were working at top speed in order to get this extended version ready even this early.    You guys are screaming about James Cameron and his team milking the system, so if it bothers you so much, then by God DON'T buy it! And don't comment with complaints! There are several really good reasons why it might not be available in 3-D, the biggest of which the technology for viewing 3-D at home at home may not be developed enough for a film like Avatar. Either way, stop being such children!    Avatar is a great film, and though you DO have a right to your opinions, please make sure they are well thought through and accurate.
0307454541|5.0|From the start to the end this is fascinating. I enjoy the way the two main protagonists' lives weave towards each other. I found the mystery engrossing, and the characters interesting to know. It was also fascinating to read the homages to other writers. I have ideas for new books to read already, though I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
1439133948|2.0|Let me start this review by saying that if you have already read the book, and you think it's great, then more power to you, and God bless.     If you haven't read the book yet, then let me suggest you get it from the library before you decide whether or not to buy a copy.     Like almost everyone who's familiar with Ms. Bujold's work, I am a fan. I love her Sharing Knife series, and the whole series of books on and about Barrayar. Her books are more than just entertaining; they are beautifully smart, stretching ideas you already have, and introducing ideas you never imagined. She almost always succeeds in giving her readers the things we hope for most from science fiction.    Unfortunately, this book falls well below her best. The plot - to me - is very dull. Miles is sent to investigate what amounts to a case of corporate greed. The corporations are all involved in cryogenics. Add it all together and what you get is big business, greed, and lots of dead people. Lots, and lots, and lots of dead people. Literally acres of dead people. Yes, there are the typical Milesian antics, but it's still dull, and dry. Ms Bujold brings in kids in an attempt to up the emotional ante, but it doesn't really help. None of the other characters seem real.    And worse of all, is the subtext, which is a sort of gray, and dismal despair. The author seems to be saying that no matter how hard we try, or how far science advances, death - true death - is inescapable, and inevitable. She does include a mention of a small group of the \\"superstitious\\" who allow themselves to just die rather than try to scrabble into cryogenics, but she doesn't even hint at what they hope for, or why they hope. The net result is a bleakness I've never seen in her work before.     Does this sound appealing to you? Corporate greed, inanimate corpses, hopelessness? Nope. Me neither.
B00455QC1W|3.0|Having waited with great expectations this DVD that includes almost all the Epics Transatlantic have ever written, I was very dissapointed; not for the choice of material - they selected the best of the best with the only absence of \\"The truth will set you free\\" - , but mostly for the poor quality of audio - Mind you that I have a audio system consisting of Linn equipment for over 10K - . There was no punch in the drums...the bass was barely noticeable. Stolt's guitar was in the forefont of the mix but was strident. The 5.1 Surround sound was almost unexistent. After hearing the first 40 to 50 minutes of the first DVD, turn to the second one...same comments. Transatlantic live in Europe is far superior from and audio perspective. I just hope that somebody of the group contact Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree)and ask him to do the remix. Sorry guys. I give three stars for the material selected but two for the audio quality.
B001N26GFM|5.0|What was most memorable about this movie is that even when people understood what was happening, and were adamantly opposed to it, they still did nothing about it. The grandmother in the movie was obviously aware and opposed from the beginning, but said almost nothing. There is some question about what really happened to her in the movie, but she was such a peripheral character I can't write much about it.     The mother in the film was such a coward when she understood the horror of the camp, yet still allowed her children to be indoctrinated by their tutor. When she saw her daughter with a crush on an especially cold and cruel young officer, she never tried to dissuade her daughter from forming an attachment. When a prisoner showed her son kindness and took care of him when he was hurt, all she could manage was a perfunctory, unemotional word of thanks. And when that same prisoner lost his life for a simple mishap, she said not one word as he was killed. She did fight with her husband about it, but she could have done so much more.     I think, as a mother myself, the character of the mother in this story was a tragic figure because of her lack of words and action to do anything to even make the life of the prisoners (two were in the house during the movie) even a little bit better. A kind word, an offering of food--but no, she did not do one single thing. Then, at the end of the movie, she suffered what no mother should suffer and partially because of her apathy of evil.     The acting in this movie is excellent (although it is odd that every person seems to have a British/Irish accent--definitely not German or Polish--which is distracting to the authenticity of the story) from the children (how do young people become so talented at such young ages?) to the adults. Every character is important to the movie, but the character of the mother is most memorable to me.    I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in history (just try to ignore the accents) and would like an unusual story of that time from a different perspective, as seen from a children's eyes, from both sides of the barbed wire.

B0030BYWKK|5.0|I just discovered this band a week ago when I saw a video clip of them performing a few songs in France and went absolutely nuts for them. I bought all their albums at once and have been listening to them in quick succession. I think this album is absolutely stunning. I didn't fall in love with it as quickly as Van Occupanther (VO), but started listening to it more so that I wouldn't get tired of the VO songs. The loveliness of this album came through on the 2nd or 3rd round. How could it not? Beautiful compositions, incredibly talented musicians...the songs may not reach out and grab you as much as VO, but build more gently. Someone in a previous review mentioned \\"ebb and flow\\" and I think that is a great way to describe this music -- like the rhythm of the tides. By the end, I'm left with the feeling that I've just heard the echo of ghosts from the past - reflecting back on life, lamenting what was lost, yet firm in the desire to try again.

031603438X|4.0|Keith Richards' Life boils down to four things: music, drugs, M/F relationships and Mick.  And if you're talking just music, this is really a five-star book.<br /><br />I'm not a musician, so to me, everything that these guys do on stage or on record is magic. If someone said \\"I'll teach you everything there is to know about this,\\" I would be sort of mistrustful.  But Richards gives you nice, detailed fascination explanations of open tuning, using castles as recording studios, writing riffs, etc. then says, \\"I really don't know how this happens.\\"  He is still a rabid follower of music and musicians, especially Chicago Blues, and when he's discussing these things he has a reverence that's indescribably wonderful.  Really, truly, I've never read a rock star bio that's this devoted to the craft.<br /><br />The negatives are probably points where Richards brushes me the wrong way.  He's way too self-congratulatory, a little transparent about his disdain for Mick. His understanding of women is pretty shallow. I imagine if he were in a car with me, I'd get annoyed...<br /><br />UNTIL we put on Jimmy Reed (on a 45 phonograph in a car.  Really?  They had those?  Friggin' awesome!)  And then it'd be heaven.  And really, all the droning parts of this book lead back to the music within a few pages, so it was a delightful read, on the whole.
B003XUKVXK|4.0|It is not often you hear the real power driven tone of a traditional name guitar in full flight. Very reminiscent of the Jimi Hendrix in tone and passion. This guy is on the road to becoming more of his own being guided by the healthy back ground of Blues tradition. With a little more development in song construction, arrangements and production will bring this guy and band into real contention with the greats. Awesome band.
B000002V07|5.0|I recently found the song by Mazzy Star on YouTube called \\"Into Dust\\".  This song is just amazing.  I then researched other songs and found the song \\"Fade Into You\\" which was her big song...again just amazing.  I purchased the CD's from Amazon and was surprized to find out that the CD came out in 1993.  I would have sworn she was a new artist.  All her songs sound like they are current.  She must have been way before her time.

0143117130|4.0|All of us have heard of Bridget Jones, if not the book but definitely the movies. What motivated me to read the book was the fact it was called the \\"mother of all chick-lits\\".  Well, I don't read much chick lits but I had to read this. Mainly I wanted to watch the movies which had Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth in it , both of whom I love. I had also seen it being described as the modern version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"..so of course I had to read it!<br /><br /> Written as a personal diary, Bridget Jones is the account of a single working woman living in London.She is afraid she will be single all her life. The thought of dying alone terrifies her.<br /><br />Bridget is obsessed with her weight, has a negative self-image and can be really silly at times. But that makes her so lovable and believable..the fact that she is flawed makes us relate to her.<br /><br />Bridget Jones' Diary is a hilarious and charming novel. There were several laugh-out loud moments. Every woman can relate to and see herself in Bridget - in her doubts and her insecurities. Even though Bridget is flawed , sometimes silly and childish ...she very relatable. She can be a social disaster at times, she can be dumb , she is clumsy and always does and says the wrong thing. Bridget is unhappy about her body and her personality. A chain smoker and a  drinker, she is trying to get over these addictions, very unsuccessfully . You feel annoyed at Bridget at times, wanting to shake her. Yet in so many ways, we are her. Like all humans, Bridget has her imperfections.  We can all identify with her in some ways.<br /><br />Bridget Jones' Diary is quirky and witty. Its not the most intelligent novel around but is still so close to life in some ways. Its fun and enjoyable. All the while I read the novel, I had many \\"Oh My God! That's me!\\" moment..which shows Bridget is so close to real life.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Superbly funny and charming!<br /><br />Recommended?<br />Definitely! To all women!
B003TML0VO|5.0|When a artist attempts covers of great songs it usually ends up strongly criticized. Carlos Santana has great management and producers and the song selection accompanied by this mans staying power \\"driven by his love and passion\\" for his music breaths life into there  original arrangements of these great songs. Carlos has made these songs his own and he is continuously reinventing himself. The addition of other artists adds the colour and additional interest to this Compact Disc. It is like walking into and old style live performance and how we miss this in this digital world. 9/10
B002NZK5TG|5.0|My daughter had knee surgery on October 27th, she was depressed because she wasn't able to go out with her friends. Instead we had the Party here! Her friends and I  made a cemetery cake, Strained eyeballs, other yummy snacks, we all dressed up (my daughter was the mummy since her leg was wrapped up) we watched \\"Little shop of Horrors\\" followed by \\"BeatleJuice\\" and topped it off with \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" on 60\\" HDTV  screen Home theater system.  We had a blast. Although she is 20 - she said this was the best Halloween Celebration she has had since she was little.
B0000542D2|4.0|I went to see this movie when it first came to our cinemas and could not hear a single thing. The humor The Beatles had at this growth stage was exciting. I was totally refreshed after watching this quality DVD in the comfort of my home. This is the band that changed music and paved the way for all the music today. The additional DVD on the making of the movie is informative. A must for Beatles nuts like me.
1401323820|5.0|GREAT book, GREAT shape.  Fast delivery. Great price.  Will use seller again, most definitely.  Love the Nikki Heat series! If you love the tv show you will totally enjoy the books.  Very clean.  My 13 yr old will read next.
B002WIDRM6|3.0|Here you have it, one more from the group. They have put together some good songs and I enjoy each one. Thanks Lady A. great work.
B001EO748M|5.0|I agree that this series was excellent. My particular love was the sumptuous costumes and scenery. The fabrics and period clothing were fabulous. The basic accuracy of what transpired around the dynamic character of King Henry VIII was kept in this portrayal while allowing for embellishment in some details of the fringe characters. Every facet of this production was first rate. I could not take my eyes off the TV when I first found this series was being aired. This kind of high quality production allows us to see that if you want fascinating drama and intrigue, look no further than the real people of history; they are more fascinating than any fiction!
0452289963|5.0|I am currently reading A New Earth for the third time. I truly believe that world would be a much more peaceful place if more people read these amazing but simplistic pages. Eckhart Tolle has opened my eyes to the major misconceptions of the mainstreams religions. A New Earth as well as The Power of Now are must reads. These two books are the most important books I've ever read.
B000JIHP88|4.0|Read the reviews and decided to buy this. It is amazing. From the moment I put it up and turned it on he has loved it. It's great because I can put him in his crib and he is fascinated with it for about and hour, giving me time to do some things around the house. It was also pivotal in getting him used to/comfortable with his crib. That way when we moved him from his bassinet to the crib, the transition was smooth. Also note, the music isn't annoying at all. However, I wish it stayed on longer than 30 minutes and that the remote did not deactivate after an hour. Otherwise a great buy.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This release gets five stars because the film itself is so good, and the transfer is gorgeous. \\"The Sound of Music\\" has never looked so good on video.     With one exception, all the extras from the previous two-disk DVD are here. The Biography Channel piece on the Trapp Family Singers is missing, but there are two new archival extras: one with Mary Martin and the other, \\"The Sound of Movies,\\" which used to be a separate release.    The new HD extras, however, are pretty dreary. They're \\"interactive,\\" which in this case means you spend lots of time negotiating cutesy-poo menus and getting little in the way of rewards. You can't actually go to one of these short segments without hearing the menu music before the menu itself actually appears. Finish one little item, and you have to hear that music all over again before the menu buttons appear. If you can hear the opening to \\"So Long, Farewell\\" one more time without getting homicidal, you're a better person than me. Before you ask, there's no \\"play all\\" option. It's a gimmick, and not a very good or well-designed one at that.    For the transfer and the other extras, though, this is a must buy.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This movie was by far the best one in the series so far. It was filled with a lot of suspense and drama. I went to see this movie on opening night and even though the theatres were packed it seemed like you were the only one there. It followed the book very well and gave the audience the images to go along with the book. The way they introduced all the characters into the movie was extraordinary as well. The special effects were completely awesome and gave more to the movie than just the storyline. The fight scenes that went down between the vampires kept the viewer on the edge of their seats during that time. The only thing I wasn't entirely crazy about was the ending of the movie. They left it with such suspense and makes you want to see the next movie right now. But, unfortunately it isn't coming out until November 2011. That was the only thing that I wasn't crazy about in the movie. The rest of the movie was amazing and superb.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This cpu is a beast, it runs cooler than my previous Athlon XP 5200+ and it can run everything i throw at it, it's fast, powerful and the price is great for what you're getting.

143350393X|5.0|I am thoroughly pleased with this product in every way. The Bible is durable, and I'm sure it will last a lifetime, or even longer if taken care of. Beautiful look, great feel, excellent quality. The study notes are relevant, and include lots of historical and cultural facts, including maps and diagrams which explain many details that usually go unnoticed. The ESV cross-reference system is extremely helpful as well. It is based on the literal meanings of words, so it is useful for understanding context, usage, etc, as well as finding related passages of scripture for study or preparing lessons. I enjoy this Bible and plan to use it for the rest of my life, and I highly recommend it for anyone who is serious about studying God's Word.
142311339X|3.0|While the idea behind the story was fairly creative and engaging, the story itself was not on the same level as the Percy Jackson series was.  I enjoyed it as a one-time-read though, but the plotlines that were so fresh in Percy seem almost boring here.    Pros:  -The idea of using Roman and Greek mythology, rather than just building off of the last series.  Smart move by Riordan, it gives him more ideas to use in his series, as he was probably running out of Greek mythology.  -The absence of Percy in the novel. Yes, I know - he's everyone's favorite monster-slaying demigod, but by having Percy missing, it at least gives the book a new spin.  It's not just Percy Jackson #2, Riordan is trying to create new characters rather than rely on old ones.    Cons:  -The three-person perspective.  The Percy Jackson books had one person narrating the story, The Kane Chronicles had two.  Somewhat annoying when you see everyone from everyone else's point of view.  I don't know if it's just me, but I'm used to having one protagonist - not three.  -The personalities.  Seriously.  OK, does every single person in Riordan's various books have the exact same personality?  Nice, but a bit of a smart-aleck and always able to come up with a snappy comeback. This basically describes every protagonist - heck, even some of the secondary characters - in Riordan's novels.    -The dialogue.  It just didn't work, Percy Jackson seemed more natural, while the dialogue here seemed almost staged.  -The editing.  Just get a new editor.  Please.      I really wanted to love this book.  Percy Jackson is one of my all-time favorite series, but this just doesn't showcase Riordan's writing abilities.  I probably will read the next books in the series, but Riordan needs to start thinking of topics for a new book now.
1416550534|1.0|I really enjoyed the Forgotten Garden and was excited when I got this book.  I am not even sure I made it to page 100, I felt like it was going in the same direction as the Forgotten Garden, just changing names and it was BORING!
0312370849|2.0|The first part of Sarah's Key is compelling, primarily because of the story of Sarah's experiences and those of her family in 1942. Julia's experiences are much less interesting, but her story contributes something valuable to the book in its early stages because we learn with her about the historical events that Sarah lived through.     Unfortunately, partway through the book, Sarah's voice is lost completely, and Julia's story becomes more about her personal life, rather than about her historical discoveries. At this point, the book goes downhill and stays there.      I wish the author had taken up the challenge to follow Sarah through her experiences during the rest of the war and afterward.  What was it like for her to hide from the Nazis during the war while also trying to cope with the traumas she had been through?  Why did she leave France?  What was her life like in the United States?  What prompted the major life decision she made at the age of 40?  We learn about these things only secondhand and very briefly.  I wanted to hear them from Sarah, the way we did earlier in the book.    Sarah's Key is unforgettable, but it is also a disappointment.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|It's like a takeoff on \\"Alien\\" and all kinds of cheesy 1950s \\"Invaders from Outer Space\\" films... the thing that most surprised me was that I genuinely came to like several of the characters. It sneaks up on you. Not perfect, but original.

B002VKE1K2|4.0|Sure, the boyfriend is a little irritating at times, but if he didn't start obsessively filming everything there'd be nothing to see. Lots of nice, subtle little touches -- things we the viewers see but the characters miss. It builds up and is worth the build-up. Becomes extraordinarily creepy after a while.

This is an excellent movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and thinking at the same time. Denzel Washington & Tony Scott have made another excellent film together. This is one of their best films, if not, the best film, together. This is one of the best action films of the year and one of the best films of the holiday season, thus far.
1439153663|1.0|Characters in this book are black or white, and I'm not referring to race.  They are either all bad (including a Simon Legree-type overseer) or all good (with completely modern opinions of race). The characters don't change over time, nor is there a sense of where this story was going.  Which was, in the end, nowhere.<br /><br />Stock tale of what was, at its most basic, a fresh idea with a young, Irish, orphaned indentured servant.  This could have been a great in the hands of a an author more concerned with telling a good story with complicated characters and unpredictible behaviors, than in showing us how bad slavery was.  We already get that.

It shows the secret of success in the business world and it's really a simple formula.  You can see the same tactics and strategies that Steve uses applied in the professional sports world as well.  I've never been an \\"Apple Fan Boy\\", but I certainly respect what they've accomplished since Steve's return.  Say what you want about his management style, but say the same things about Steinbrenner, Phil Jackson, Parcells, Belichick, Jimmy Johnson, Cowher, etc - how many rings do they all have?  You can learn a lot of things to apply in your own life from this man and this book!

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|In Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino, the characters demonstrate cultural boundaries and tension, as well as racism. It   also explores the ideas of sacrifice, atonement for sins, and the meaning of life and death, specifically in Walt's character. The film begins by presenting these themes which develop through the plot. Ironically Walt, who continually mumbles racial slurs, transforms due to his growing relationship with his Hmong neighbors. He begins to differentiate between people who have either good or bad intentions, rather than by culture and race.  After the death of Walt's wife, he becomes increasingly distant from his uncaring family. However, he forms a new family with his neighbors despite the negative events surrounding their first encounters with each other. Although the film both begins and concludes with death, there is a focus on the preservation of life during the film. There is even life as a result of the tragic ending. Walt made the ultimate sacrifice in order to protect Thoa and his family from the violent gang. Through this sacrifice he was also able to atone for his sins from his actions during the   Korean War. Each character was given what they deserved by the end of the movie.      This film effectively portrays the themes while keeping the interest of the viewer. Besides Sue's character, the   acting was exceptional. Like the film, the acting was believable and powerful. The film provided insight on the   changing racial issues in America today.  It can be appreciated by all mature viewers.
B003S898SG|4.0|I own most of Angra's album and as one of the other reviewers said, this album takes a few more spins to really be absorbed and understood, I think. Unlike past efforts which were pretty consistent thematically, this one varies a bit from the formula in places and occasionally pays off nicely. I wouldn't consider this a truly \\"progressive\\" metal effort though it has a few nods towards that genre throughout the album. This album is a nice mix of classically and Brazilian influenced music that takes some time to try a few new wrinkles here and there.<br /><br />Overall I'm not sorry for the purchase though I doubt this will get a really consistent spot in the rotation for me. I'd rate it as a slightly less appealing effort than Rebirth and Temple and perhaps about the same quality as Aurora Consurgens which I found to be a reasonable if a bit predictable effort. Anyone who already owns a fair amount of Angra's back catalog shouldn't hesitate to purchase, just keep expectations realistic.

Most common issues for open couples are covered with candor, and several approaches are given to handling each one.

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|This is a travesty - a disjointed, badly-written, spectacularly crass insult to an intelligent and VERY funny series.  The shift in setting to Abu Dhabi leads to a embarrassing series of racial stereotyping, the four leads come across as spoilt and arrogant, and the plot is basically made up as it goes along.  There is one redeeming scene - a terrific exchange between Miranda and Charlotte about the headaches of motherhood as they get drunk together - but that's it.<br /><br />So disappointing.  Such a shame.

This movie will live on until the end of time, it should be put in a time capsule, it's that good. Cat Stevens music adds to the enjoyment of watching this film. Harold and Maude is a gift for the senses and soul, so buy it and watch it when you are happy or sad.  And just like love, share Harold and Maude with everyone you care about.

So, if you are looking for some of the plot of the new film this year, this would be a great place to start.

0312600844|1.0|I bought this book on the strength of Randy Boyagoda's review in National Review magazine.  I was fascinated by his discussion of literature, the glimpse of the plot he offered, and his conclusion that Jonathan Franzen has more than done his part for the great American novel.    He got me, hook line and sinker.  Never in a million years did I think National Review would recommend a book so filled with repetitive, grimy, unwholesome and adulterous sex. The endless sequence of \\"love\\" affairs was gruesome.  F-bombs littered nearly every passionate dialogue, whether it was bickering, fighting, or foreplay.    I found this book to be utterly appalling.  I was torn, upon reaching the halfway point, between abandoning the sunk cost of my already wasted time, and my curiosity to see where the plot might twist, and whether it might improve.    So, in a fit of masochistic intrigue, I finished the book.    The ending was jarring, as though the author was distracted by the ringing bell of the ice cream truck coming up the street, and tossed in a throwaway ending so he could hurry outside.  The happy ending was simply not credible.    Other elements were not credible too:  Walter as the proto-liberal; as a man who adheres perfectly to his Puritanical moral convictions while also aligning perfectly with everything progressives would desire in an activist.  Even white whales actually exist.    I wish I could get my money back.  But more importantly, I wish I could get those tortured hours of my life back.  I welcome each fresh morning as the lurid prose becomes less distinct in my memory.    I finished the final chapters while sitting by the fireplace in my big easy chair.  I read the ending, and exclaimed `you've gotta be kidding me!'  Then I threw this disgusting book into the fire.  It seemed the sensible thing.    Randy Boyagoda fooled me once - shame on him.

You might even find yourself shedding a tear or two in this over-the-top horror-comedy hybrid.<br /><br />Meet Shaun (Simon Pegg), a man in his late 20's whose stuck in a bit of a rut. Like many of us Shaun is having a hard time finding his place in the world and spends his days working at a dead end job. His nights are spent at pub called the Winchester with his mates and girlfriend. Things go from bad to worse when Shaun forgets to make reservations for a special night with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). Liz decides she's had enough of Shaun's irresponsibleness and dumps him. His relationship with his mum and step father isn't healthy either; and just when you thought it couldn't get any worse for poor old Shaun the zombie apocalypse begins! Together with his underachieving, video game playing flatmate Ed, Shaun has to figure out how to save his friends, salvage his relationship with his mum and get his girlfriend back.<br /><br />If I had to use one word to describe Shaun of the Dead it would be \\"fun\\". This is a film that can be enjoyed by just about everyone. The dialog and acting are brilliant as are the make-up and special FX. The violence and gore is satisfying without being too over-done. The blu-ray disc is loaded with tons of fun extra content including four commentaries, extended scenes, deleted scenes, plot holes (a comic strip that fills you in on well... plot holes) and much more. Despite being released in 2004 Shaun of the Dead is already a horror classic that is not to be missed. For more, please check out [...]

B001U6YI92|5.0|THE FILM:<br />The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is a legendary film that is considered by many to be the greatest Western ever made. It spawned entire new genera of Western films called the \\"Spaghetti Western\\" and in many ways re-invented (or at least reinvigorated) Western films at the time of its release. The film, which is now over 40 years old, was considered to be horribly violent upon its release (pretty ironic considering the content in films now-a-days). There can be no doubt that all these years later director Sergio Leone was a master craftsman who has gone on to inspire countless film-makers such as Quinton Tarantino.<br /><br />THE STORY:<br />The Good (Clint Eastwood), The Bad (Lee Van Cleef) and The Ugly (Eli Wallach) is the story of three men with the same goal: to capture a hidden treasure. But in order to do so, they'll have to make their way through the battered, Civil War-torn United States. Each character has varying personality traits that make their titles seem a bit off-beat, particularly Tuco. It's a story where good and bad aren't so cut and dry and the grey in the middle is the soup of the day. Now back when this film was made, most cowboys were baby-faced good-men so this shade of gray was indeed a rarity. The original American release was cut due to time constraints. Thankfully, those cuts have now been added back into the film so that we may enjoy this classic as it was meant to be seen. It's a three-hour epic takes us through a Wild Western world that is ravaged by the Civil War: North vs. South; brother vs. brother. Though the war rages on throughout the film, the characters themselves, while affected, are never truly involved in it. Instead, all three are after gold and out for themselves.<br /><br />THE BLU-RAY:<br />I'm new to the Blu-Ray market but I can tell you that this is by far the best disc I have purchased so far. The video looks amazing, multiple audio tracks abound and there are tons of extras including a terrific commentary from Christopher Frayling.<br />Video is bright and clear. You really wouldn't know this movie is 40 years old. The remastering process is simply incredible and it's something that I hope is given to all older films of this caliber in the future.  The audio is crisp and clean with multiple language tracks to choose (English: Mono, 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio, Spanish & French: 5.1 Dolby Digital, Italian mono) and two commentary tracks, one which is very good and one that is rather dull.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />This is how Blu-ray discs should be presented. The film is terrific and the amount of bonus content is staggering. No doubt, you'll be coming back to this disc several times before it's all said and done. The Good, The Bad, The Ugly still remains THE Wild Western film. It's a standard that few titles old or new can match.from Christopher Frayling.<br />Video is bright and clear.

B00447G2T8|5.0|This album was an outstanding strongest solid comeback from the german power metal kings helloween, And I thought gambling with the devil was their greatist effort, well as a matter of fact I didn't think they coul'd have done any better without roland grapow and uli kusch but man was I wrong. 7 sinners is their sickest fastest heaviest darkest modern metal album of all. These guys sure as hell did not screw around when they made this new album and I must say they've gotten serious for the first time in 25 years, I assume their last album unarmed was costing them most of their fans and they had to prove to them once again that they are metal and they sure are. Every song on here is just pure metal to your ears which they have taken more of a modern type metal approach and what I like in this new album is their keyboardist they have hired, who ever he is they should stick with him because he's wickedly awesome on the keyboards and 1 track they play a flute solo which was really good even though it doesn't quite blend in with the metal.<br />Thier new album kinda looks like something out of a saw movie and im just wondering, did these guys stay up all night watching a whole bunch of saw horror movies and got the idea from that? I don't know but it looks cool!<br /><br />Kai hansen would be very proud to see how much andi deris has turned his old band around and to those of you who thought helloween has sold out to another chameleon experimental image , This new album here was meant to reclame their dignity as power metal kings, So did helloween sell out? Absolutely not!<br /><br />UPDATE: They wrote 3 excellent japanese bonus tracks such as:<br /><br />Aiming high<br /><br />Faster we fall<br /><br />Im free<br /><br />I don't know where to get the bonus album from but you can listen to it on you tube and they sound epic!<br /><br />\m/ Stay metal \m/
B0000AUHPG|2.0|THE FILM<br />Once Upon a Time in the West (C'era una volta il West) is Sergio Leone's 4th Spaghetti Western. Filmed in 1968, the movie was successful in Europe but flopped in the United States. The lengthy Western was originally cut in the United States from 165 minutes to 145 minutes. In 1984 the film was restored to its original version for home video. There are many who consider this to be the best Western film ever made but I for one must beg to differ.<br /><br />THE STORY<br />Listen, I obviously love Westerns. The Dollars Trilogy are three of my favorite movies. However, Once Upon a Time in the West is an incredibly slow-paced, boring, film with surprisingly sub-par acting despite the great actors involved. All this makes for a painful three hour watch that only those who love the genre will want to watch.<br /><br />The film opens with an incredibly cool scene featuring three gunman waiting for a train. It is later in this scene that we meet the mysterious man known as \\"Harmonica\\", a man who plays a sad tune. Unfortunately, it's all down hill from here. Basically, the story takes place in a fictional developing Western town. A landowner owns property outside of town which houses the only water-source for miles around. Steam engines require water and soon railroad tycoon Morton is after the land. His hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) kills the landowner and his family. Meanwhile the landowner's beautiful new bride (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans. The young woman of questionable character soon finds her new family is dead and thus she owns the land. Soon after, you'll find yourself falling asleep.<br /><br />-The DVD-<br />This disc has certainly got the royal treatment and for those who do like this film, you're in for a treat.<br /><br />  Video:<br />  The video is simply gorgeous.

B000022TSW|5.0|I first saw this in probably the best atmosphere possible. And that was on its opening Friday night in a very large sold-out theater in Denver (South Park country).    The electricity was the equivalent of seeing a great rock concert. People were laughing so hard that I was missing much of the dialogue. That didn't really matter though. It is still the most fun I've ever had watching a film.    When I watch the movie now, that electricity is gone. But I'm able to catch all the dialogue and appreciate how great it is beyond the laughter. It is truly a terrific film that takes on many issues in sometimes subtle and often blatant ways.     It's not for everyone as many have stated here. It certainly can be offensive to many sensibilities, I suppose. But if you can watch most R rated movies without any problems, and the idea of cartoon people saying and doing vulgar things doesn't make you flinch, then see this baby right away.
B0036R92V2|3.0|\\"DJANGO! Have you always been alone? Have you never loved again?\\" These ridicules lyrics open up Django--a film directed by \\"the other Sergio\\", Sergio Corbucci. Released in 1966, Django starred Franco Nero and went on to spawn over 100 imitators (though according to the Spaghetti Western Database there is only one sequel, Django 2: il grande ritorno AKA Django Strikes Again). Even recent films such as Takeshi Miike's Sukiyaki Western Django feature the Django name. Upon its release, Django was considered to be one of the most violent films ever made, most notably due to a scene where an ear is severed. In countries such as Sweden, it was actually banned!<br /><br />The Story: Django is a quite a sight to see. The man (who has a striking resemblance to Clint Eastwood and happens to act much like the character from the Dollars trilogy) slowly drags a coffin behind that contains a machine gun. He stumbles upon a racist group lead by Major Jackson and saves a young woman named Maria from being killed. Because of this, Django becomes involved in the major events effecting the local mucky town. But there is more than meets the eye to the quite man who has a purpose.<br /><br />For the most part, the video quality is so-so but there are spots where the video certainly looks even more dated. The original Italian track is thankfully presented here as well as a (pretty badly done) English dub. Both are Dolby Digital 2.0. The documentary portion has a really neat interview with Franco Nero as well as various people who worked on the film. It's interesting, especially for those of us who are fans of the genera.<br /><br />THE CONCLUSION:<br />In my opinion, no Spaghetti Western's are as good as Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy. While there's usually some unique and often times charming elements to be found in them, they are typically B level movies at best. Django falls into this B-movie category. The idea of storing a machine gun inside of a coffin that a guy slowly drags behind himself is a pretty cool one and I can fully understand why back in the 1960's this film was so successful. The dark, quite atmosphere is certainly nifty. That being said, compared to Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy, Django's world feels very small. It's a film worth watching but the plot and pacing are perhaps something that a 12-year old boy would enjoy more than an adult.ty cool one and I can fully understand why back in the 1960's this film was so successful.

B004AKCME8|4.0|Let me start off by saying that the visuals in this movie was BREATHTAKING. So much to the point that it's probably the main reason why the trailer appealed to me as it did. I personally don't think that it's too dark for some children,as some reviews may say. There is,however,some fighting and violence so if that's not your cup of tea then I wouldnt suggest it for you.    As far as in comparison to the books, it DID change alot of things(one of them being that there was both a Kludd AND a metal beak....there is a reason why that doesnt make sense but I won't say for those of you peeps that is reading the series and doesnt want spoilers)...also might I add that it isn't only based on the first 3 books. For nyra,a future mate of Kludd, doesnt come into the picture until book 4,The Siege. But it doesnt jeopardize the sequal worthiness I just think if there ever was a sequal(god I hope so!) it will stray even farther.
B003YOZNBK|1.0|...it ain't good. Horror, action and the Western are combined in Jonah Hex, the film based on the DC comic book. You'd think that combining horror and Wild Western action would be a win-win, right? But somehow it ends up being a forgettable train wreck by the time it concludes.<br /><br />Jonah Hex fights for the Confederacy until his commanding officer, Quentin Turnbull gives the order to attack a hospital. Turnbull's son draws on Hex because of his refusal to attack and is shot dead. Quentin Turnbull doesn't take kindly to his son being killed and hunts down Jonah Hex at his home. Turnbull ties Hex to a cross outside of his home and burns the house down with his wife and son inside, forcing him to watch. Turnbull also brands Hex's face with a hot iron, disfiguring him. Hex hangs on the cross for days, dying until Crow Indians find and rescue the dying man. Using an assortment of magical techniques they somehow manage to bring Hex back from near death. Now the former Confederate soldier has a mysterious power that grants him the ability to bring people back to life for a limited amount of time.<br /><br />Hex wants revenge but Turnbull dies in a hotel fire before he can extract it. Doing what he knows best, Jonah takes up bounty hunting and soon becomes well-known. It isn't long before Turnbull turns up in a train robbery looking quite well for a dead man. It seems that Turnbull plans to destroy the United States government using a weapon of mass destruction that looks like Dragon Balls (you know, from Dragon Ball Z?).<br /><br />The film starts out quite promising. I enjoyed the first fifteen minutes but unfortunately it was all downhill from there. Josh Brolin does a fine job as Hex but the character doesn't have much depth to him. Lilah, Jonah's prostitute love interest played by Megan Fox seems like an almost thrown in character who has virtually no back story. We're never told why she cares for Hex or for that matter why she's a whore. As in her other movies, Megan Fox is nice to look at but as an actress she's downright terrible (especially in this role).<br /><br />While I don't think it would have saved the film, the PG-13 rating is incredibly limiting for a Western that is supposed to have horror elements such as this one. I'm not saying that blood, violence and gore are the answer to all the negatives found in Jonah Hex (or any other film for that matter) by any means but without limitations the action sequences could have at least been more satisfying. Sadly, like most of the film, with the exception of the first town shootout, the action feels very bland and thrown together.<br /><br />The soundtrack doesn't do it any favors either, sounding like a typical late 90's action film with its roaring orchestral score and occasional electric guitar rifts. Perhaps the composers should have listened to some of Ennio Morricone's works for inspiration.<br /><br />Maybe its nit-picking but the special weapons in this film just look dumb. They're incredibly cheesy and just so uncreative. If you look at a film like Van Helsing where the vampire hunter uses a variety if nifty artillery in cool ways and compare it to Jonah Hex one cannot help but sigh at the lackluster efforts. Between the lousy looking guns at the utterly stupid looking Dragon Ball weapons of mass destruction, you're left to wonder just who designed the props for this movie.<br /><br />At a running time of about 80 minutes it's story is lackluster and feels thrown together. A majority of the action sequences are dull, the acting is fairly sub-par on all fronts and even the films score stands out as a negative. I seriously wonder how this film got a theatrical release. Had it been a SyFi original movie I would have at least given it a little leeway but perhaps that's being too kind because I've honestly seen far better SyFy original movies such as Ghost Town. I went in really wanting to like Jonah Hex and to disagree with the critics who ripped on it. After all,I love horror films and I love well-done Western films but in the end, Jonah Hex fails to be a good Western or horror film. In fact, it fails to be a good film period.ut in the end, Jonah Hex fails to be a good Western or horror film. In fact, it fails to be a good film period.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I wouldn't want a fight-picking adolescent inebriated on his own self-image (or is it self-pity?) as my Captain.  Let's hope he will have grown up in time for the next sequel and manages to exhibit some of the dignity that Captain Pike conveyed with an elegance so lacking in Kirk.    And Spock, it is neither fair, nor logical, I might add, to deny a star cadet of a deserving position and affect the trajectory of her StarFleet career simply to avoid the appearance of favoritism on your part.    Why does the Romulan spaceship -- from the future -- resemble an ugly spare parts warehouse in its interior?    Sufficiently entertaining otherwise, worth a watch for its quick pace, visuals, story, humor and overall \\"prettiness\\" factor.
B001GCUO5W|4.0|Within the last few years I'm amazed at Leonardo DiCaprio's transformation. He's come a long way from playing the annoying little street rat pretty-boy in Titanic to playing leading roles that one could call... manly! I feel this transformation started in Gangs of New York (a film that I don't like) and culminated in Blood Diamond. Since that time he's gone on to do films like The Departed and most recently, the critically claimed Inception.<br /><br />Perhaps one could say that Shutter Island is more of a psychological thriller rather than a horror film. While I would argue that many of these things are one in the same; I will say that for those who are looking for horror there are plenty of those elements to be found. Leonardo DiCaprio plays U.S Marshal Edward Daniels. He's been sent to investigate the disappearance of a patient at Ashecliff Hospital, a mental facility for the most dangerous and psychotic of the criminally insane. The hospital itself is on a remote island located just outside of Boston. On the fairy ride over, Daniels meets his partner, Chuck Aule. It seems that the patient the Marshal's are looking for has simply vanished into thin air. What's more, things at Ashecliff seem strongly amiss. For example, the doctors and staff are less than willing to cooperate with the investigation. What's worst is that a hurricane is fast approaching, threatening to make Shutter Island even more chaotic.<br /><br />The description above is indeed bare bones but there are reasons for that. I'll simply say that there are plenty of psychological twists and turns that will keep you on your toes and have you wondering just what in the bloody hell is going on. Few films are able to keep me in the dark these days but Shutter Island truly managed to do just that.<br /><br />The atmosphere is captured perfectly. When we first arrive on the island, a storm is approaching yet Ashecliff Hospital (at least on the outside) is presented as a peaceful, well-kept facility with its perfect green lawn and tended flowers. Still, we as an audience know that something is awry from the sinister sounds of the musical scores haunting tone. Of course, much of Shutter Island's brilliance can be credited to Martin Scorsese, a man who has directed such classic gems as Goodfellas.<br /><br />While Shutter Island isn't a perfect film (there are a few scenes I felt dragged on a bit too long) it is in essence one of the most pure horror films you can watch. It plays on many of our fears including mental sanity, darkness and remoteness with the inability to escape. With it's cryptic story, great acting and unforgettable atmosphere, Shutter Island will indeed make you shutter at least once... if not more! For more, please check out [...]tended flowers.

0684857219|5.0|Not many books out there on the market like this one - nor are there many books like this in Amazon with such a mixed review, yet it still remains at 4+.<br /><br />I agree. This book is a classic and I had an older version way back when, but still look at it from time to time. I think that the 1 star ratings do have valid points. I think their points are that most lifters like Arnold Schwarzenegger needed performance enhancing drugs, and that many of the exercises are potentially too much for the average joe/jane. Who cares? Read, look, and decide what interests you and what can fit into a realistic training regime for you. It's simple.<br /><br />Body building is not the only drug oriented sport - the Olympics are essentially drug dependent as are other popular sports (in America - football, in Europe Cycling, etc . . ). I am not saying that I endorse drug use in sports, but it is there at all levels and it is a necessity for many/most professional athletes. So - the book makes good sense for those amateurs whom are able to select specific exercises/routines that they like as it also works for more professional lifters needing ideas and inspiration.<br /><br />There is a lot of good sensible advice such as training schedules, and fundamental exercises practiced in gyms that I have seen around the world. So but the book and understand that Schwarzenegger was a professional lifter when he wrote this and that this time frame was in the experimental days before a lot of the ethical issues arose.<br /><br />It's a gem !!!!<br /><br />Get the video below at the same time:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000C3I6U Pumping Iron (25th Anniversary Special Edition)]]
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|Bram Stoker's Dracula attempts to combine the historical Vlad the Impaler, Bram Stoker's novelized Count and other film versions of the most famous vampire making for one of best Dracula films one can watch.<br /><br />Since Bram Stoker's 1897 novel, the name Dracula has become legendary. Bela Lugosi would immortalize the vampire lord in his 1931 film. Today the name and even the image of Dracula (particularly Lugosi) is recognizable worldwide. When this film was made back in 1992, Produced and directed Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather), had fallen into financial turmoil. The director now talks openly about how this was a tough time in his life. Perhaps those moody, dark times actually helped to set the tone of the movie itself. This Dracula film attempted to combined the original Dracula novel with the historical Vlad the Impaler along with various other legends, myths and movie versions of the famous count.<br /><br />The film starts out in 1462 Transylvania. Vlad Dracula, a member of the Order of the Dragon, returns from a victory against the Turks to find his wife Elisabeta has committed suicide after receiving a false note of his death. A priest offers no comfort to the war-torn Vlad, telling him that his wife's soul is eternally damned. Vlad obviously doesn't take too kindly to this and in a rage renounces God. For this, he is cursed as a vampire. What's interesting in this scene in particular is that there is historical truth. Vlad the Impaler's wife (apparently) actually kill herself after reading a false note of her husband's death. Cut to 1897 England, where law clerk Jonathan Harker takes over for colleague Renfield who has gone bloody mad after returning from Transylvania to meet with Count Dracula. Harker travels to Transylvania to finish Dracula's acquisition of Carfax Abbey in London. You know, the fact that Renfield went mad might be a good sign not to go. Little does Mr. Harker know what he's in for. When Dracula sees a picture of Harker's fianc&eacute;e Mina, he is astonished to find that she is the reincarnation of his long deceased wife.<br />Dracula sails to England and takes up residence at Carfax Abbey and it doesn't take long for the Count to make an impact on the locals.<br /><br />The casting is interesting to say the least. Gary Oldman takes lead as Count Dracula and gives a very unique performance as the Count that works. He's convincing throughout and manages to combine the Historical Vlad Tepes and Bram Stoker's vision of Dracula perfectly. Winona Ryder plays Mina Harker. She's good in this role and is probably my favorite actress to ever play the part. Anthony Hopkins played a rather strange Professor Abraham Van Helsing. Honestly, as good as Hopkins is he just never really worked for me in this role. Perhaps it's because I have pre-conceived notions about how Professor Van Helsing should act (more wise instead of... goofy and crazy). Sadie Frost takes the part of a very naughty Lucy who could take me for a ride any time. Keanu Reeves plays a Jonathan Harker that not only seems a bit too young but just downright out of place. His British accent is one of the worst I've ever heard. If there's one actors that brings this film down, it's certainly Neo. Overall though, I really do feel that this is one of the finest casts assembled for a Hollywood Dracula film.<br /><br />All the set pieces look great from Dracula's creepy castle to Lucy's gardens. The costumes are equally impressive making you feel like you're apart of both 1462 at the very beginning of the film and 1897. I will say though that Dracula's armour stands out. I honestly feel like a more traditional black gothic looking armour would have worked better here. But it's certainly unforgettable.<br /><br />What we have in Bram Stoker's Dracula is an interesting combination of horror and erotic romance in a proper setting. It is without a doubt one of, if not my favorite Dracula (and vampire) films ever made. Make sure you check out Bram Stoker's Dracula, I promise it will leave a lasting impression.ave a lasting impression.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|OK - this is simply a classic. If you like Arnold, if you are into lifting (seriously), or if you would like to see a docudrama that changed societies crave for exercise this will be a great view. I guess the other event that changed society, in the area of the health craze that grew out of the 60's and 70's would be running (i.e. Bowerman).<br /><br />Remember - it's a classic, so a bit oldish production wise being a bit before predator and terminator. This ads to the experience for me and when looking at the price, as of the time of this review, such a DVD for under $5 - is it really possible to go wrong?<br /><br />Again if you are into Arnie in any way you can't really go wrong here. If you are not into Arnie, in any way, I can't imagine how you made it to this page on Amazon or this review. Order it and get ready to enjoy - probably more than once.
B003YCI1O8|4.0|I have the regular DVD, so I jumped for the chance to get the Blu-Ray version, for the extra features.    This is simply a fun movie to watch.  It doesn't take itself seriously and neither do Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward in the movie.  Actually done quite well, considering it was done before CGI.    Why only 4 stars?  Well, I wish there had been commentary along with the movie, rather then just comments in the extra features.    I have the entire Tremors set, so I look forward to releases of the rest of the movies on Blu-Ray.    It is easy to sum up the movie.  Two slackers who really hate to do work are called upon to save a tiny town in the middle of nowhere from underground creatures.  And joined in by an interesting group of characters, including a survivalist played by Michael Gross, and his wife, Reba McEntire in her first movie role.
0060775858|5.0|I have three children 8,3 and 2. From the oldest to the youngest this is one of our all time favorites. Threre is a peaceful rhythm to this book that just sets the tone for dozing off to sleep. At the end when the little rabbit is saying goodnight to everything we continue by saying goodnight to one another. I just ordered another one for my 4 year old niece. We actually read it so much we all know it by heart. I'll be buying this book for my grandkids many years from now.

0307474712|1.0|I bailed on this book after only 5 pages because the main character was so annoying and I could tell he would never get any less annoying.  Gave it to a co-worker but told her to run as fast as she could from this awful book!  Usually I give a book 50 pages to see if it gets better but I could tell this one wouldn't!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is AMAZING!!! I give it a five star rating. Its about this girl being sent to fight for her life and then falling in love. I wont spoil anymore.
0316069485|1.0|To give Michael Connelly a one-star review can seem somewhat ridiculous.  Connelly is a GREAT writer, and his Bosch books will most likely be read for generations to come.  But even great writers can get lazy, or be greedy or be uninspired and put out something that should never have seen the light of day.<br /><br />This is a half Haller and a half Bosch book, and neither character gets his due.  But I would suspect that Connelly is much more keen to write about Haller.  The chapters featuring Bosch are especially lifeless and inert.  Bosch mostly just goes through his routine duties and mostly very little happens.  The reader essentially learns nothing new about the detective or even his daughter.  Connelly has completely lost interest in his detective.<br /><br />The Haller chapters aren't quite as dull.  It is interesting in this book to see Haller working as a prosecutor for a change.  But the case he is prosecuting is basically open and shut.  There is virtually no suspense and the trial proceeds in a fairly perfunctory manner, up until the end, when there is a very welcome spurt of violence.  If this had been a real trial, all the spectators in the gallery would have fallen fast asleep.  Maybe even the judge.<br /><br />Do not buy this book.  Do not waste a moment of your time with it.  With The Reversal, Michael Connelly has shown himself to be a great writer who has committed a great fraud upon the reading public.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|This Daria season collection is the best dvd set collection I have ever bought, the only thing that's not so great about it is that the music is in the episodes were changed drastically. Other than that you get the satisfaction of seeing the episodes one by one. It's really great!!
B003ZVJFFM|2.0|I've loved some versions of A Christmas Carol, but for me this one is too loud and in your face for kids under 10 or so.  If you didn't see it in the theater thinking you'd save money and buy it for this holiday season, I have to say I don't recommend it.  If you want a fun family version of this, I recommend going instead with Mickey's Christmas Carol or The Muppet Christmas Carol!      I saw this in the theater with my kids and spent the whole movie helping my son cover his ears in anticipation of the next loud surprise.  When the ghost of Christmas present screams and writhes while he rapidly ages and turns to dust was a low point; it required some convincing that staying for the end would be worth our while.
B003ZD9DUC|5.0|I have had this movie on just about every home video format since Betamax .  This is as good a picture as you will get on this title , unless they restore it IMO ...  What also really stands out is that we get the original actors voices , not the dubbed USA  version ...A real treat and a ground breaking movie !!  Since I bought this again , I consider it a must own !!
B0044XV3QY|1.0|Two disclaimers; like everyone else here as of this writing (presumably), I have not actually seen this collection, and; I already own the original release of \\"Avatar\\".     Having said that, I note that this version contains no 3D version and, most surprisingly, no digital version of the film (widely considered to be almost 'de rigeur' for big-SFX-budget video releases).  So unless you didn't buy the original release of the film, arguably all you are buying here are the 'extras' that SHOULD have been included in the first release.  It is difficult not to view the decision to release the movie in this way in a cynical light.    I have little interest in owning a 3D version of the movie, although I did enjoy the 3D version at the movies.  But I was very much looking forward to putting the digital version on my iPad. So I will be passing on this release. I believe that whomever is making the decisions on what to release and when will eventually go for my wallet with a digital version.  Till then, I'll live with the original Blu-ray version, and pass on purchasing little more than the extras separately here.
B0041X90ZS|5.0|If you only read one more sentence in this review, make it the next one:<br /><br />BUY THIS DVD/CD BOX SET!!!<br /><br />Forgive my \\"lack of originality\\", but I can only echo what's already been said of this live Transatlantic album:  Not only is it a SWEET deal for what you get (2 DVD's/3 CD's) but it's one FUN concert!  (3 1/2 hours mind you...) I just love how you can TELL these guys are having FUN playing their music.  They're not just putting on a concert, they're ENJOYING putting on a concert.  Neal and Mike especially.  (You'll see what I mean when you get to the 10 minute mark on \\"Stranger In Your Soul\\".) Daniel Gildenlow from Sweden's \\"Pain of Salvation\\" joins the band again on this tour (He's become \\"the 5th Beatle\\" of this band) and is a lot more \\"outgoing\\" on this DVD than he is on the \\"Live in Europe\\" DVD.  Neal's voice is a lot better on this DVD than it was on the others as well. His voice doesn't break when he goes for the high notes.  The other vocals are executed well too.  Another interesting part is that Neal and Roine have traded vocal parts on \\"We All Need Some Light\\".  A complete flip of the studio version of the song.  Kind of cool that they changed that up a bit.<br /><br />Again, as has already been mentioned by another review, this is definitely a concert DVD that will be watched again and again.  If you're a Transatlantic fan, this is DEFINITELY worth having in your collection.  So go on now...BUY IT!!!
0525423842|2.0|Like Grisham stopped typing and decided to finish the novel (almost) mid-sentence. Even if you accept and believe this to be a novel meant for pre-teens or tweens, it is still weak.<br /><br />Theodore Boone, Theo for short, is a 13 year old teenager, is the son of lawyer parents, has a more than keen interest in law, sees himself as a trial lawyer when he grows up, often helps out his school mates with legal troubles. When a murder trial starts in his town, he is obviously interested in following it. Which he does, even arranging with the trial judge to have his class attend the first day of the trial. When Theo is introduced to a cousin of a low income student that he teaches, and who may be a crucial witness to the murder, Theo is caught up in a dilemma as to what to do. To tell his parents, or his Uncle Ike, or the judge, or the police. What complicates matters is that the trial is about to come to an end in a matter of a few days, and more importantly, the witness is in the United States as an illegal immigrant, and is therefore not willing to go to the police for fear of deportation.<br /><br />The premise is interesting, and promises lots of thrills, suspense, and action mixed with the innocence of youth. Except the premise remains a premise. The plot never goes anywhere. There are no surprises. No twists. No suspense. Nothing at all. The novel JUST ENDS. I actually turned over the last page more than a few times, expecting to read more. There was nothing. I checked online on Amazon.com to see if a page or more had bee torn from my copy. No. That's it.<br /><br />Hugely disappointing. From any author this would have deserved 3 stars at best. Coming from Grisham this deserves a low 2 star rating, if not a lone star. This book reeks of an assembly line mentality, shoddy workmanship laden writing.

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|This is hands down one of THE WORST movies EVER made.  I have seen the word vapid throughout these reviews and AGREE!  There are so many things wrong with this movie, I can't even begin.  I loved the show.  I hated this movie.  I actually think bot S&TC movies were terrible but this was monumentally, ridiculously, amazingly B-A-D. Oh except for when Liza Minelli performs the Beyonce song at the gay wedding. I pray they never make another one of these disasters. I think I am going to go set my dvd's of the tv show on fire.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|The only similarities between this movie and Jane Austen are the names of the characters.  Other than that it is a horrific example of a good idea going terribly wrong.  I, too, was offended by the crudeness and attempt to modernize the movie with trendy, but inappropriate themes.  UGH.  Don't waste your time.  It was a total waste of mine. Jane Austen would be rolling in her grave to have her name attached to this junk that calls itself a movie.
B001DCZ4IW|1.0|Love the movie. Unfortunately Amazon VOD changed the movie to \\"Full Screen\\" and cropped the Film from its original aspect ratio. There is no clear warning that this will happen until you buy the movie and it's too late.

B0041T52S6|5.0|The movie has no real parallels. It is Napoleon Dynamite quirky, and slightly reminiscent of 60's acid films (which may be the best way to watch this movie.) Scott Pilgrim is in a band with Stephen Stills and a guy name Young Neil waiting in the wings. He is currently dating a 17 year old Chinese school girl who wears Catholic school uniforms. Her name is Knives. They play video games together. Scott has a dream about a girl, then meets her in real life. They start to date and now he finds out if they are to continue dating he must fight (literally) her 7 ex-boyfriends. These fights take on the characteristics of video game battles complete with Batman like \\"Zonk\\" words, special effects, and magical weapons. The humor is at times laugh out loud funny. The dialogue is extremely clever and witty. Scott also lives with (shares a bed with) a gay roommate (Wallace), although Scott is not gay.  Wallace has the ability to immediately text message Scott's sister whenever something happens in Scott's life. He can even do it passed out drunk. If you liked this film you might also enjoy \\"Kick-Ass\\" which also boasts quirky humor and special fight effects. No nudity. No foul language. Adult situations. WARNING: This film is not for everyone. You will either love it or turn it off after 20 minutes.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|Not sure why most everyone says how scary this was compared to the first one and people jumping out of their seats etc. Maybe that was my problem, I believed all the hype and then was let down. The movie is about a scary as the first one. It was very slow at times and I was dozing off in the theatre, out of boredom, not being tired.<br />It picks up a bit towards the end but it was just ok.<br />The movie used loud noises as it's primary way to scare you which I find lame. Also, the dog hardly barked at anything. I have two shepherds and they would not have acted like Abby, who seemed to never notice any of the loud booms and bangs in that house.<br />I'll give it 3 stars to be kind.

The terror it brought to my young mind is not even explainable. I remember many long nights afraid to sleep due to this book. While this sounds terrible its also wonderful because it started my love for the horror and suspense genres. It's why I write it.

B001ANYDAO|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell typically avoids the trap of \\"correlation vs. causation\\", but in this book he succumbs. The book is chock full of fascinating stories and data, but he relies too heavily on anecdotal stories to draw his conclusions. At the end of the audiobook, Gladwell is interviewed... and he discloses that this is the book that most reflects his personal views. I felt that notion the whole way through and was not at all surprised to hear that at the end.    Again, great stories and very interesting correlations between those that succeed and the opportunities they had. However, I don't feel this explains the origin of outliers at all.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|How many stories in the world are connected ? Even past ones are connected with the actual ones we're part of. I don't know how many times I've watched AVATAR and still don't have an idea how many times I will because I LOVE and ADMIRE this groundbreaking spectacular, amazing, SF movie. AVATAR deals with the dark side of us, how reckless we're to make profits of others even if it will destroy us at the end. It deals with the urgency to reconcile man and the Earth. I have great respect for JAMES CAMERON's work, from the Aliens to the Terminator ( the first two of course ) to AVATAR. Cameron always brings something new, the unexpected. I remember how impatient I was to see AVATAR on the big screen. I even got out in November 20th, facing the Snow storm, just to Watch one of the greatest movies of all time.<br />This DVD collection is a must.<br /><br />Avatar is a Above all.
B003W4YQUG|4.0|My title sums it up basically.  What if you made American Beauty on a really tight budget and set in the 60s?  This movie would have been amazing before AMERICAN BEAUTY, but as a release a decade later, more of an homage to that far better movie.    That said, this movie is far better than %99 percent of the wretched dreck that's been released in the last ten years.  That's because it both has a story AND features good actors.  Imagine!    So it's a very pleasant evening's diversion for $2.99.
B0044IJ1S6|5.0|I have seen every DM tour live since 1989 101 tour + own all of their live videos.  I missed the Tour of the Universe  due to a work committment outside of the US.  I was actually out of the country for the entire US leg of the tour so I have been waiting an entire year for the release of this dvd.. It was not a disappointment.  It was awesome seeing the boys in hi-def and I felt like I was there.  I don't agree with what others are saying about the set list and video footage.  It's Anton Corbijn people, of course it's blurred and artsy.  It's exactly what I expected having seen DM live many, many times.  I'm still not over the fact that I had to sell my Tour of the Universe tickets due to having a work issue, but this does go a small way to statisfy my Depeche Mode obsession.

B00003CXXJ|3.0|Dreamworks studios again attempted to create the perfect balance with its animated feature \\"Shrek.\\"   I enjoyed the movie \\"Shrek.\\" I have been entertained each time I've watched it.  My concern with this film is that it has been repeatedly marketed as a children's movie when it clearly is not. There are elements of the film that children would enjoy, just like there are elements of drugs and alcohol that children would enjoy; just because children would find something fun and entertaining does not mean they should be allowed to take part in it.  As an adult, I have the cognitive ability to watch and enjoy this film.  I can filter out the jokes that are too crude or crass for my tastes and enjoy the finer aspects of the story, such as the emphasis on true beauty coming from within. As a parent, however, I will not allow my child to watch this movie until she is old enough to have developed this filter of her own.  She is a child, and it is my responsibility to protect her until she is old enough to fend for herself.  I am unapologetic about this because I understand that \\"Shrek\\" is not a children's movie.  \\"Shrek\\" is a movie that was created for adults and marketed to children.

0810983915|5.0|A young boy and his young friend deal with the challenges of growing up throughout the summer.   Gregory Heffley (Main Character) has just finished a challenging year of middle school and is looking forward to summer break. Greg likes to hang out, and play video games inside with his best friend Rowley Jefferson, his mother is not to thrilled about that idea. She wants him to go outside and play sports, go to the pool, and do other outdoor activities.   In the beginning of Greg's summer vacation he starts to go to the country club with Rowley's family, because they invited him, and they are members of the country club, but after Greg complains to the club manager, and makes Mr. Jefferson look bad they don't really want him coming back with them anymore, and making them look bad again. After that \\"Country Club Incident\\" Greg and his family go to the pool but it's hard to go back to the pool life after tasting the life of a country club.   About around August Greg, and Rowley's family go to a beach house for about a week, to relax, and Greg finds out and does some interesting things as well.    The book, and series itself in a very good read and very popular, as well. A lot of people have read it I highly recommend that your go to a library or bookstore right after you read this review so that you can read the book for yourself. Overall it was an amazing well written book.

B0028ER4PK|5.0|This sixth ELEKTRA release by the DOORS was this quartet's best since [[ASIN:B0028ER4Q4 STRANGE DAYS]], and as it turned out, the group's last hurrah with front man Jim Morrison.<br /><br />The set's opener, \\"The Changeling,\\" shows most clearly the self-inflicted wear and tear Morrison had endured over five years. \\"Love Her Madly,\\" \\"L.A. Woman\\" and \\"Riders On The Storm\\" were legitimate hits-- \\"Hyacinth House\\" is also excellent. Despite the gushing of diehard fans, what's left over here is somewhat ordinary. But that was always the pattern with this group-- they'd astound everyone with a classic like \\"Riders\\" and then bewilder us with the march-beat laden \\"L'America.\\" The full-sounded musicality of \\"Hyacinth House\\" would be offset by a dragging, bareboned \\"Cars Hiss By My Window.\\"<br /><br />From 1967 to '71, the DOORS had undergone many stylistic shifts. At any given moment they could be Top 40 hitmakers, psychedelic wordsmiths, political heralds, frothy pop artists, and here, a blues-grunge band. It's hard to imagine what else these guys would have created had Morrison lived. L.A. WOMAN seems as fitting an au revoir as any. One thing is certain: you didn't know what was coming next from the DOORS, and it's too bad we were never destined to find out.<br /><br />TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 48:42
B000IOERBG|5.0|Okay, maybe thriller isn't the right word but Robert Harris does another excellent job with a historic character here. He entwines history with fiction and modernity in such a way that other writers should take notes. I have always had an affinity for Russian based novels but I think this would appeal to others as well. I loved it and would love to read another book involving a character or two from this. Great stuff!!
B00288KNJU|3.0|I suppose it's my fault for not paying closer attention to what I was buying.  I assumed, wrongfully, that this was a blue ray 3D I could play on my 3D TV.  It's not... it is the type of 3D that requires the multi-colored cellophane 3D glasses.  If that is what you are looking for then it is fine...
0061989142|5.0|Great book for anyone who loves LC and her style. It's full of easy tips & tricks when it comes to makeup and clothes, and how to piece together an outfit & what to wear for special events etc.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|This is an awesome set, including all 3 Toy Story movies on dvd and blu-ray--what a deal! I know some are complaining about the packaging, but we love the toy box set. If you must have the jewel cases, then by all means purchase each movie separately, but I think this box set is perfect. I actually like the foam slot storage system--much easier than the jewel cases and a really cute display in the toy box too. We're very glad to have the set at the 64.99 price.
B0031R5K72|5.0|The Book Thief is an extrodinary insight into the 2nd world war,and its written from deaths perspective.It shows how disgusting Adolf Hitlers actions were,and how it changed lives.This book changes the way you look at life and is an interesting and exciting read.It will make you laugh,cry,want to scream and tear out the pages,and you will never want it to end.I'm 11 years old and lots of my friends and family have read this book,which shows its a book for ALL ages!One of the most amzing books i've ever read in my life!Marcus Zusak,you're a genius!
B0043GAZYS|4.0|I had wanted to see this movie because of its interesting premise. The movie is based on a comic where the protagonist has to fight the ex-boyfriends video game style. Each ex-boyfriend is like a level boss in ascending order of when she dated them. They film makers have done a good job of presenting the video game feeling into a non animated movie. Even though it is probably targeted to a younger audience then myself, it might be better suited to my generation because of the video games it more closely resembles. At first I thought Scott was going to have to get some kind of training to fight the ex-boyfriends, but he was ready to go from the beginning. The fights are way over the top just like Street Fighter. high flying kicks, over powered punches. It is wonderful to watch. The young cast do a great job in their parts and Jason Schartzman does a great job as the main antagonist. I am glad to have purchased this and enjoyed watching it with my family.
0061537969|5.0|[[ASIN:0061537969 The Art of Racing in the Rain: A Novel]]     Many tears were shed while reading this story, yet the ending made it all worth it. I think anyone who has ever loved and lost a dog will enjoy this. My most peaceful moments in life were spent with my loyal German Shepherd at my side and many times I used to look into his soulful brown eyes and feel as though I could read his thoughts.

B001NEK2GE|2.0|The G13 documentation says that they support OSX, but this is only marginally true.    I've been trying to configure it now for 3 hours and so far I have the following problems, even after attempting to re-install the software:    1) The LCD display is completely useless; it's just random screwed-up bits.  They change now and then, but they're never more than skewed image bits.    2) The configurator software has a bizarre inability to bind specific keys.  For instance, you can bind a key to command-W, but command-T or command-Z do nothing.  Try to bind a key to ESCape, and your dialog just disappears.    I've dropped to vi in the shell after exporting settings and edited the xml by hand and gotten around the Z binding problem, but I have no idea what-- if any-- logical name they've assigned to the ESCape key.    So far I've found logitech devices to be a PITA on OSX... going back to when I had one of the nice gaming keyboards on a previous machine; it had exactly the same problem with the display being blitzed.    I hope these problems don't plague the Windows users, but Logitech still seems to leave OSX users twisting in the wind, as usual.

0763644765|5.0|We just purchased 3 books from this author for our grandson, and he LOVES them (we purchased Binky, No No Yes Yes, and Potty)!  The instant he saw them he laughed out loud at the baby and was begging us to read them to him.  We've read them over and over and over and over again!  He seems to really identify with the baby in the book, moreso than any book he has read to date.  He is just barely starting to show an interest in potty training, but you can tell he's really thinking it over when we read Potty to him.  I think his curiosity has been piqued.  You will not be sorry if you purchase this book!
1564029654|5.0|We originally received this book as a gift from a friend. She noted that it's a favorite of her son's and we see why.<br /><br />This is a great children's book. The story, combined with the amazing illustrations, make a winning combo.<br /><br />There are three owl babies, who are worried that their mama owl isn't going to come back from hunting for food. My favorite owl is the smallest, Bill, as he repeats the same line each time it's his turn.<br /><br />It's a sweet story. I love it just as much as my son does. At almost 3, he still loves to hear us read it to him. I'm sure I'll be reading it to his little brother when he's a little older as well. It's a must-add for any child's book collection.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The Blu-Ray release of \\"The Sound of Music\\" is the most beautiful edition ever.  There are details in the film I've either never noticed before or some I haven't seen since the 70MM theatrical release in 1973 which I saw on a large Todd-AO curved screen.  Be sure to notice the details in the scenery, the little houses in the distance you really don't see on other editions, the roughness of the stone walls in the abbey and the detail of the fabric in the costumes. You can even focus in on a single blade of grass while Julie Andrews sings the opening sequence.<br /><br />Unfortunately you don't get the curved screen effect on a flat panel but the colors are so much more vivid and warmer than other editions.  All the little extras in the collectors edition are sweet touches too, especially the little book that comes with it.<br /><br />Julie Andrews is at her best and her most beautiful in this edition.  I have seen this film probably hundreds of times in my life and I must say it is my favorite films of all time.  I was three years old when I first saw the film when it was first released in 1965 (yes, I remember seeing it then) and I was 10 years old when it was re-released the Summer of 1973 which ran for months in my city.  I went to see it about 17 times on the big curved screen.  I lived close enough to the theatre where I could ride my bike to the theatre and see the film whenever I was able to scrape together the dollar admission to see it.  Oh the simplicity of that age compared to now.  With the Blu-Ray edition of the film, it took me back to 1973 and it was just as exciting to watch.<br /><br />Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore which is a pity.  Call me a old softie, but I just love the feel good material, especially with all the insanity to deal with these days.
B003L1ZWG2|5.0|Frozen... what is there to say that hasn't been said? Well, firstly, I am seeing a few five star ratings- this is the scariest thing about Frozen in my opinion. The movie Frozen follows a group of young adults (and I use the term adult sparingly) who are on a weekend retreat to ski and snowboard. This trip soon goes from fun to frightening when they play a trick on a lodge employee and are later left stranded many feet in the air awaiting rescue from what will be a weekend affair in the air.<br /><br />The negatives start from the very beginning. The acting is believable- but the scenario and cliches that are toyed with that spoil the 'plot' of this film. It all is just so terribly over exaggerated. The worse part is just that they keep piling thing after thing up and making it more and more ridiculous as it goes on- making it impossible for you to 1: Take any of the movie seriously and 2: Keep a straight face. Honestly, I saw this only because I knew how terrible it'd be. The price of the ticket is as much as a blu-ray. That alone is enough of a sign that this movie is nothing other than utter failure.<br /><br />I'm trying so hard to not spoil anything but it's so hard. The things I wish I could convey in this review are just... oh goodness.<br /><br />Honestly, I am going to leave it at this: If you have 15 dollars that you don't need or want another funny movie in your collection, or are a big fan of cheesy horror- then buy this. Honestly, despite how terrible this movie was, it did exactly what was intended. It entertained me to no end. So, if you have some time to waste and money to go along with that time- please... do yourself a favor and get this movie.
B0036EH3TS|3.0|I have the Criterion Collection DVD of this movie and it is great. When the Blu ray was out for this movie, I thought it was the Criterion Collection, i bought it and quite regret to own this blu ray. Are they coming out with the colletor's edition? if they do, i will buy the collector's edition.
B003VSVWA0|1.0|I ordered 4 of these cd's and all of them were bad...None of them could be played, even thought it was my car and took it to the dealers. To find out it was the cd's.
B004B8RWX0|5.0|Definitely an awesome series so far, it's something innovative that nobodies tried yet.  A zombie-horror tv series?  who'd a thought...??  Of course I can imagine most tv series being at their best in the first few episodes, then writers tend to run out of ideas and put in filler material etc...  But hey, this is definitely new and different and not full of too much b.s. drama so far.  If you like zombies, check this tv series out.  I hope this series maintains this level of entertainment...
0385523912|5.0|If it were not for the professional status, impeccible credentials, and exhaustive references of this author, I would think she was very skillfuly feeding us an extreme line of anti-communist propaganda.<br /><br />The author extensively interviewed six defectors from North Korea to South Korea over the period 2001 - 2008, and the stories she developed based on these interviews are depressing and beyond anything I had imagined about North Korea. It is hard to believe that an entire country in this day and age would be starving under the misguided policies of a paranoid maniacal dictator! I am glad I read this book. It was an eye-opener, and makes me more than ever thankful for my own country, imperfect as it is. I thank Ms.Demick for writing it, and pray for eventual recovery and progress toward a more normal existence for the poor people of North Korea.
B003VS0CYC|3.0|I love Robocop ever since I have watched it the 1st time, and right now they came out with the blu ray trilogy, and of course as a blu collector, i bought it, the transfer is just like everyone talking about, the quality of the pic still can improve especially the 1st episode, and i think they should have put all the special features that DVD has back into the 1st episode of Robocop blu ray so that everyone can enjoy the features. Anyway, i bought it in a low price, still worth for me to collect it because i love the series.
0761158464|1.0|Very disappointing!  The graphics were dim, hard to see, and really not all that interesting.  Very colorless & boring overall.

B004C5Q4WC|5.0|I loved this episode, with one exception * Spoiler Alert* Don't read on if you haven't seen it! :) The lady who owned the german shepard was thee most ungrateful woman I ever saw! No thank you for saving me from my abusive alcoholic boyfriend, no thanks for keeping me from eviction, no thanks  for not turning me into a monster and killing me and my son. Ugh! And she called him a freak! How ungrateful can one be? I hope in a future episode she gets mugged and killed, and surprise bow wow won't be there! I hope that skin walking dog finds a new home with grateful owners!
B003H6KRIE|5.0|i have been always wanted to get the Bourne Trilogy, the movie and story i don't have to say much as everyone already knew, the quality of the picture and sound is really perfect, this is a movie worth to collect, and with the slim package trilogy, you can collect your Bourne Trilogy without wasting space on your shelf.
1401323820|3.0|I think I enjoyed it because I watch the TV series and felt familiar with the characters. It was true to the show as far as characterization and feel. Curious about the true author...
B001EC3JME|5.0|I got this flashlight holster just two days after ordering.  It is well made and works perfectly for my smaller flashlight that I carry on my belt while riding my motorcycle.  It looks like an item which should last for years and you just can't beat how fast it came.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|It is unfortunate that the director/writer/producer would not permit the DVD Blu-ray versions of Avatar to be distributed in letterbox or 2.35:1 or 2.40:1 format. Unfortunately as distributed viewing Avatar on DVD or Blu-ray is like viewing the movie with a magnifying glass. It is absolutely ridiculous.
B000JVSUS4|5.0|I like Michael Bay's films, all of them, and this is 1 of his film that i love all the time. When the director's cut of DVD came out, i bought it, and i am totally satisfied with the picture quality and sound quality. Now coming to blu's age, they came out with blu ray for this movie also, what you waiting for? get 1 of it and keep in your shelf as collection.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Not having Starz to watch while this show was on.I decided to order it rather than rent it.I will tell everyone not to quit on this show after the firat episode.This show gets better with each episode and finishes strong.If you dont mind the really fake blood splatter the movie itself is great.Some sex scenes could have been better or eliminated altogether,but i am glad i now own this entire season of this series.Packaging could have been a little better to protect the discs but they all arrived with no damge.
B003MPH6EI|5.0|Trying to stick to a season 3 review is difficult for me. Just about anything I say can also apply to season 1 and 2.     A glowing review is deserved for the entire series. Series 3 is hard hitting as drama climaxes in many ways and is dependent on knowing the history of the show. Immediate revisions of past events come to mind while scenarios play out. I could give multiple examples but do not wish to include spoilers.    Many episodes have a season ending dramatic feel to them. Questions are raised and quickly answered yet events seem lifelike and plausible.    If I were to pick which season I liked best, it's season 3. Yet, I love them all.    I bought Season 1 & 2 on blu-ray. I could not locate season 3 in stores (not available yet, I believe). So I have now officially purchased my first ever on demand show from Amazon. This goes against the grain for me, I do not believe in paying for TV shows on the internet. Yet, I broke my belief due to the stranglehold this show has on me. It took an incredibly brilliant masterpiece to do this to me.    Right now, I picture an AMC corporate mind saying \\"We got him to buy our show on demand and he will buy the Blu-ray when it comes out also. Score! We double dipped into his wallet\\" and he/she will be right. I just fell into the pocket of corporate America.     I have no regrets about purchasing season 3 on demand and am waiting for season 4 to start up soon, with baited breath. Thus ends my generic review.
B000VWE5OY|1.0|I can make this short and sweet, horrid Buffy wanna-be poor writing, pathetic plots...if you saw the series Extra second season, and you saw what they did to the show he was trying to make, all I can figure is this is the real life result of what the character BBC forced Rick's character to work with in that show would have made on his own.    P.S. If you are a zombie and you can talk...you can breath...that is how talking works....so you can give mouth to mouth...all I can figure is they hired people with no education to write the shows. The only good thing about this series is it makes the worst of the Star Trek series look like the best of the Farscape series.
0812973992|5.0|NYT reviewer Jonathan Mahler called Let the Great World Spin \\"...electric and profound.\\"  I can't think of adjectives better at describing this wonderful book.  How refreshing it is to read really good writing, literature if you will, that is both exciting and meaningful, a book in which the author ensnares you before you are really aware that you're caught in his fictional lair.  To then add an emotional wallop to it, is an act of creative excellence that left me heartbroken, but not depressed (again borrowing adjectives from reviewer Mahler).  While the situs of the book is NYC in the mid-1970s, and while many call it a book that captures the soul of the city, ultimately it is about people and their underlying stories which could occur anywhere in the world.  Yes, the book is about love, loss, grief, and the unpredictability of life, but it also about living through it all and not just coping, but coping well, and in that sense it is uplifting.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Everyone already knows the movie is great, and I love the combo pack. But this is the first and last time I will pre-order. I didn't receive it until a full 7 days after release date, even though it only had to travel 30 miles. And it cost the same as it would have had I just picked it up mystelf at Target. Lesson learned.
0385342047|3.0|Our fave chick lit character, Becky Brandon nee Bloomwood, is back with a mini me. Her daughter, Minnie, is a perfect example of a Terrible Two's. She claims everything as \\"Miiiiiine!\\" She runs the household, recognizes Starbucks and shops, and is completely out of control. In the middle of Minnie's christening, a financial crisis breaks out. The Bank of London has gone bust. Chaos ensues, budgets are implemented, cut backs are made. But none of this seems to affect Becky. She finds a way around it all and creates a solution for her personal shopping clients. Meanwhile, she's also planning a surprise birthday party for husband Luke. Becky? Keep an event hush? Plan a party on a budget? It seems nearly impossible, doesn't it?<br /><br />I appreciated Sophie Kinsella's acknowledgement of a recession and somehow still wrote a story about the biggest shopaholic ever.

B000ETQR3Q|4.0|But what gun is perfect? I'm a college student who is very much new to Humans vs. Zombies and Zombie Hunt events, though I've owned Nerf guns for a while now. The new Longshot CS-6 is pretty fun to haul around (everyone gets intimidated by its grand size), however when it fires it begins to fall short of (at least) my expectations. It does not shoot much farther than most of the other Nerf models I have (Recon, Alpha Trooper...), which made me wonder why it was any better than what I already had in my arsenal.    It's fun to lock and load, sure, but when you pull the trigger and the spring inside releases tension, you can just feel the thing reverberate in a kind of goofy manner, as if it had more potential. Folks, it does. At first, right out of the box, it's not too hot; I mean, it's decent, yes, and the sniper look is very much awesome. However, if you have those power tools lying around, and you find a good tutorial on Longshot mods, then I can assure you the gun will (if all executed correctly) shoot further; some people are crazy and mod them to shoot 100ft+ (check eBay, some mod and sell them there), but I would recommend not doing that, because if there is a closer encounter, that would sting like a bee. Or maybe a jellyfish. I dunno.    In any case, four stars because it's a decent gun as is, but is completely open to modification. This gun has good potential, though it's not the easiest thing to crack open and fix up (don't strip the screws!). I believe it is aimed more toward the older audience of whoever buys Nerf guns, but if your young'un wants to give it a shot, it's a new incentive for getting some muscle mass. Happy Nerf shopping!
B003W5C0VM|4.0|This is a straight up, full steam ahead show.The Stones are on a relatively small stage compared to recent shows. The setlist is made up of rockers, save for Love in Vain. The blu ray sound is dynamic, with clear separation of instruments.The video is god good but retains some of the film grain from the original movie. Highly recommended!
B0015DROBO|4.0|I resisted reading this book for two years before I broke down and bought the trade paperback - for $7.99 it wouldn't be too severe a loss if I didn't like it. I assumed that because of all the hype that it could not possibly step up and deliver.<br /><br />It is not a masterpiece. After the dreadfully dull and hard-to-follow first chapter I almost gave up. I have a short attention span for boring discussions about business/politics. However, chapter by chapter I was reeled in until I had no choice - I was interested in the outcome and in the character of Lisbeth Salander, who shone so brightly above all others in the book that she felt like someone I knew. And liked. And I despised Erika Berger on her behalf, although quite honestly I disliked Berger from the moment she was introduced as she seemed a superfluous character to me. The relationship between her and Mikael Blomvkist was not so much shocking as it was just annoying. While it may be true that Europeans are more relaxed about such relationships, America is not without its own surprising number of such relationships. I've digressed - back to the book: I fervently desired for Berger to just kick off at some point, and not just for Salander's sake, although for the life of me I do not understand what was so compelling about her. More than once it was mentioned that she \\"purred for the camera\\" (blech), charmed the elder Vander (groan), or was in a royal pet at Mikael about something or other. Please. Lisbeth was far superior to her.<br /><br />The book was not superbly written nor was it poorly written. I am sure that some of the writing just did not translate well into English, hence the awkward/cliched phrases. The drinking of copious amounts of coffee and the eating of sandwiches did not bother me and I am perplexed as to why this was an issue with some readers. The violence was not nearly so rampant as I thought it would be, judging from the howling indignation of many one-star reviewers. There were horrifying scenes but these were kept to a minimum; certainly other crime novels, even ones written by saintly Americans (gasp) have contained more sex and violence than did this book. In a story about a twisted serial killer I would think that's par for the course (speaking of cliches...).<br /><br />I do think there was too much long-winded detail about business goings-on, especially regarding the magazine Millenium. I honestly did not care that much about its demise though I did wish for Wennerstrom to get his just desserts.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson does have a gift for creating a complex mystery and I truly was shocked at the revelation of the killer and was anxious for the resolution of Harriet's disappearance. But his crowning achievement is Lisbeth Salander. I just can't stop thinking about the girl and her haunted life. There are many wounded birds like her in society, although not so many have her prodigious talents. She is truly one of a kind and is the reason this novel gets four stars instead of three. Now I've just started The Girl Who Played With Fire and hoping against hope that the damnable Erika Berger takes a very long sabbatical away from Sweden and out of Blomkvist's life.<br />So - if you are offended by violence, scenes of rape and other depravities, my suggestion is to read lighter mysteries. There are enough in-depth reviews out there now about this one that you should be able to make an informed choice about whether or not the subject matter is something too offensive to bear.these were kept to a minimum; certainly other crime novels, even ones written by saintly Americans (gasp) have contained more sex and violence than did this book.

It is always a very complex interweaving of both.<br /><br />What then is the right question?  Try this: \\"Is the trait under examination an evolved psychological adaptation, a byproduct of an adaptation, or random variation?\\"  (Think the umbilical cord, the belly button, and variations in belly button shape -- e.g., \\"innie\\" vs. \\"outie\\", respectively).<br /><br />And, if it is a psychological adaptation, is it generally obligate (relatively robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation)?  What are the neurological substrates of the psychological adaptation?  If it is generally facultative, what specific types of environmental inputs influence it?<br /><br />The particularly relevant question for this book is this:  \\"Which psychological adaptations are sexually dimorphic?\\"  We know Fine's position on this one -- she desperately wishes that the answer is \\"none.\\"<br /><br />However, sexual selection theory and a vast body of both animal and human empirical evidence suggest otherwise.  Non-human animals have no culture, but, of course, most species do show evidence of sex differences in behavior that derive from evolved, sexually dimorphic neurological adaptations.  In humans, culture itself is built on a foundation of psychological adaptations, some of which are sexually dimorphic.<br /><br />Fine erroneously believes that a few research critiques will dispatch even the notion of evolved human sexually dimorphic psychological adaptations, leaving culture free reign on a sexually monomorphic blank slate.<br /><br />Simon Baron-Cohen, whose work is critiqued in Fine's book, unfortunately had to spend a little time writing a rebuttal titled \\"Delusions of gender - 'neurosexism,' biology and politics.\\"  It is worth a Google search to read his response.<br /><br />Fine's book would actually provide better material for Simon's cousin, Sasha.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />This is almost overkill, but do a search on Youtube for \\"Sex differences in brain development.\\"  There, one can literally see sex differences in cortical thickness by sex, and the relative changes that occur from the ages of 9 - 22.<br /><br />Also, for summaries of recent research, do web searches for:<br /><br />\\"The Genetics of Sex Differences in Brain and Behavior\\"<br /><br />\\"Evolving Knowledge of Sex Differences in Brain Structure, Function and Chemistry\\"<br /><br />\\"Widespread sex differences in gene expression and splicing in the adult human brain\\"elusions of gender - 'neurosexism,' biology and politics.\\"  It is worth a Google search to read his response.<br /><br />Fine's book would actually provide better material for Simon's cousin, Sasha.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />This is almost overkill, but do a search on Youtube for \\"Sex differences in brain development.\\"  There, one can literally see sex differences in cortical thickness by sex, and the relative changes that occur from the ages of 9 - 22.<br /><br />Also, for summaries of recent research, do web searches for:<br /><br />\\"The Genetics of Sex Differences in Brain and Behavior\\"<br /><br />\\"Evolving Knowledge of Sex Differences in Brain Structure, Function and Chemistry\\"<br /><br />\\"Widespread sex differences in gene expression and splicing in the adult human brain\\"

B002KSPKRS|1.0|I bought this to replace my Ear Force X3 which quit working properly and while the unit sounds okay, the X41 has a lot of quality problems. I actually ended up buying two of the X41 because the first set I bought quit working about 3 days after I got them. They would stay on for about 3 seconds and then cut out and turn off and the Microphone was full of static (made super loud when you move the microphone). I bought another to replace the first one and then returned the defective set. The new X41 I got also has a lot of problems. If you bump them at all while on your head they turn off, if you turn the mic on and off it will made a loud popping noise and turn off sometimes and they eat batteries big time. So, this is the last Turtle Beach headphone product I will ever buy. There are better manufacturers out there. I strongly suggest you don't guy these but instead buy some Tritton Technologies. The guys I know that have them say they work pretty good.
0553805371|5.0|Stephen Hawking's Theology Revealed in The Grand Design  By John H. Calvert    The title of Stephen Hawking's latest book,  \\"The Grand Design,\\" implies that the universe arose from an intelligence.  But, the message inside is the opposite.  For Hawking the apparent design of our universe and of life is an illusion, explained by unguided natural causes.  So, he doesn't \\"need\\" a Creator to relate our lives to the world.     He claims everything just naturally arose out of a quantum event that has no pre-history or antecedent such as God.  All that followed was determined by the mindless laws of physics and chemistry that have no author.  Even our free will is an illusion.      Like an oracle, Hawking is revered as the high priest of modern science.  He admits these conclusions seem absurd, for which he blames quantum physics.  The absurdity of quantum theory is true for him but unknowable to us.    So, what can a lay person make of this \\"scientific\\" answer to the ultimate question of life: Where do we come from? Should we too believe we don't need God?      I am like a skeptic who eons ago got advice from a Roman High Priest derived from his \\"readings\\" of the entrails of a gutted calf.  How can I, lacking the ability to read entrails or understand quantum theory, trust the Priest's explanations?     Perhaps we should ask the Priest: \\"Are you required to provide an atheistic explanation for the origin of the universe and life? Can you ever entertain the alternative suggested by much of the evidence and the title of your book that the apparent design of the universe and of life may be real?\\"     The questions are answered on pages 29-34.  For Hawking, \\"Modern science\\" does not allow any intervention in the natural world by an intelligent cause.  Only an atheistic answer may be given by the \\"modern scientist\\" to the ultimate question. Richard Lewontin, another \\"modern scientist,\\" explains that this Dogma or commitment to \\"materialism is absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.\\"     Oddly, Hawking asks if the universe \\"needs a creator,\\" when he knows his Dogma doesn't permit it.  This is weird, because the Dogma suppresses critical thinking and open-minded inquiry, the core value of true science.  Why does he even write the book or engage in the inquiry if the answer is specified in advance?     Imagine a coroner sent to the ascertain the cause of a death.  He finds the deceased hanging by the neck from a tree, hands tied behind his back, and five tightly spaced arrows buried in his heart.  An autopsy shows an arrow caused the death when it stopped the heart.      The prosecutor looks at the coroner's report, which classifies the death as \\"accidental,\\" and says: \\"This is absurd, the data shows a homicide.\\"  The coroner, responds: \\"Well the rules don't allow an intelligent cause, so the only ones left are natural or accidental. The death was not natural, so it must be accidental.\\"    I read on with growing skepticism.  In Chapter 7 - \\"The Apparent Miracle,\\" Hawking details significant evidence that the Universe and the properties of the matter, energy and forces that constrain it have been \\"fine-tuned\\" or designed for life.  Life would not exist if any of the values of these physical features had been set differently by just a small amount.  So, the data \\"suggests\\" a \\"miracle\\" accounts for life.     The only way to show the miracle to be an illusion is to show it happened by chance.  But a single universe doesn't provide enough chances.  So to not \\"need\\" God, he needs more chances, which he artfully acquires by pulling 10500 additional \\"parallel\\" universes out of a quantum hat.    But we can't observe any of these other universes, count them or know how they arose, if they did.     There is an additional problem with this seemingly contrived explanation.  It rests on the false assumption, explained on page 32, that once the laws of physics and chemistry are in place, they determine life, just as they determine \\"the orbits of the planets.\\"  This is not the case, as biochemists have known for fifty years that the laws of physics and chemistry do not determine the content of the messages in DNA that drive life.  The sequences of the four genetic symbols that carry the messages of life per a \\"code\\" are arbitrary and not determined by law.  Otherwise, DNA could not carry the functional information necessary to generate and control life.     This misunderstanding undermines the no-God conclusion, for even if a quantum event can explain the laws of our Universe, those laws have not been shown adequate to explain the origin of life.     Hawking's theology also uses an incorrect definition of \\"religion\\" when he seeks to exclude it from science.     He admits the question his book addresses is \\"The Ultimate Question of Life.\\"   But, that is a religious as well as a scientific question.  Legally and functionally, religion includes Atheism and other non-theistic beliefs, about ultimate questions - \\"matters of ultimate concern.\\"   Thus, his dogmatic no-God response to this religious question promotes the religion of Atheism, not an agnostic, open-minded science.     So, whether or not intended, the effect of The Grand Design, is a misleading theology that promotes the religion of Atheism.  It is not an objective discussion of the state of our scientific knowledge about origins. Atheists will love it, but they are not the only patrons and beneficiaries of science.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Wonderful movie - heartwarming, touching, and well done.  Came only a few days after submitting order.  Best service I've ever had!!!
B001FOR5XU|4.0|I like the story. To read this, though. One must not question the flawed plot development. Matheson uses a fair amount of biology in his story. The problem is. He wasn't very knowledgeable about biology... Even worse, he wants us to believe that the world's foremost scientists didn't figure out what he did in about three minutes. It's simply not plausible. The latest film rendition w/Will Smith is enjoyable. It is also very different from the book.<br /><br />There's a pandemic occurring. A basic tenet in infectious disease, is to seek the microbe. Neville goes to a public library, & slowly gives himself a rudimentary education in infectious disease & hematology. He goes on to make discoveries & reasoned guesses that a trained scientist would automatically do within one afternoon. Yet, not one scientist in the world actually did. Ignore that glaring problem w/the central plot, & you'll be rewarded w/an enjoyable read. Now, if you'll excuse me. I have to turn the front porch light on. Someone is banging on the door for me to come out...
0201485672|5.0|This book changed the way I think about software development.  It's a little old, but the principals still apply.  The author writes in a simple way where anyone, reguardless of background can understand.  The termonology the author uses is priceless and creates a way for programmers to speak to one another in an effective way.  I would recommend it to any software developer, regardless of career stage or background.

B000002UZ1|4.0|My love affair with the Beatles began at age thirteen, when a friend and I listened to the \\"Abbey Road\\" album on her parents' stereo system and sang along with 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer'. I began asking for Beatles' albums for Christmas and birthday gifts, and eventually fell into the genius of the Red and Blue Album collections. The Red Album (officially known as \\"The Beatles 1962-1966\\") was my first purchase, and while I loved it, my father told me that I would like its companion much more. While I've certainly enjoyed \\"The Beatles 1967-1970\\", it hasn't surpassed its predecessor in my eyes.    The Blue Album, as this one is affectionately known, catalogues the Beatles as they went through their experimental phase until the end of their career. Beginning with the nostalgic 'Strawberry Fields Forever' and 'Penny Lane', it channels the Fab Four in their drug-hazed glory. Psychadelic favorites such as 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' and the confusing yet fun 'I am the Walrus' abound on disc one, which ends with two of the group's most famous songs: Paul McCartney-written classic ballad 'Hey Jude' (which, at 7:11, was the longest single to ever top British charts for over two decades) and John Lennon's rocking 'Revolution'.     Disc two opens with the Beach Boys' sounding 'Back in the USSR' and then begins to showcase each individual band member. We get some of George Harrison's best work in 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', 'Here Comes the Sun', and 'Something', as well as more Lennon and McCartney goodness with fun tunes 'Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da' and 'Come Together'. The album ends with the lush 'The Long and Winding Road' in its full Phil Spector glory.     This album is, by no means, a bad one. It's a great collection of the best the band put out during the final four years of their career, at the height of their creative genius. However, I'm more a fan of the sound of their early career, before drugs, peace, and pressure kicked in. Lyrically, though, you can't argue the magic of this album. The Beatles broke new ground with the second half of their career and began a legacy that still reverberates forty years on.

1439156816|5.0|First half of the book is a brief, hilarious life history of King. Second half, his ideas on writing. My summary of the highlights:    1) If you want to write well: write a ton, read a ton.     2) King equates writing to uncovering a fossil. He thinks plot is a jackhammer. He promotes the use of more precise tools - character development, interesting predicaments, vocabulary, grammar, rewrites, etc.     3) King's approach: write with honesty about what you know. He thinks of some interesting characters and puts them in a predicament then uses his intuition and powers of observation to record what his characters do. Plot is an outcome, not something planned ahead of time.     I've read many other books on writing. All but one were heavy-handed, negative or cynical accounts of all the rules and structure you must follow when writing, and heaven forbid you want to be published, you fool-hearted soul. The one book that deviated from this formula, unfortunately, was a lifeless, wandering goo with no backbone.     King's book is energizing, upbeat, insightful, and well worth reading.

0385341008|5.0|This novel is told through letters and I really enjoyed that. A lot of books I've been reading lately have incredibly long chapters so this was refreshing. The main recipient of these letters is Juliet Ashton. She spent WWII in London writing under the name of Izzy Bickerstaff detailing a modern woman's experience in the War and became very popular when she published these pieces as a book afterwards. Meanwhile, she receives a letter from a Mr. Dawsey who owned a book that she had previously owned and they strike up a conversation via letters about his experience during the War. Mr. Dawsey lives in Guernsey, which if you don't know, was occupied by Germany during WWII. He and his friends, as a way to have some much needed fun, form the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.<br /><br />For me, what was most enjoyable about this book was all of the wonderful people you get to meet. Even though the book was pretty short, the authors introduced us to multiple characters who were well formed, entertaining and believable. Another thing that was really wonderful was that the book honestly portrayed how difficult the War was for both those who had lived in London, and even more so for those who lived in occupied Guernsey. Even more so seemed to be how much they wanted to survive. It really gave a sense, through being a part of the Guernsey community, they were able to rebuild their lives after the War.<br /><br />The sad thing of course is that because it is a war not all of the characters we are introduced to and grow to love will survive. Also, this book has been a huge commercial success for the authors and it was Mary Ann Shaffer's first book, and she sadly passed away in 2008.

B002ZG999U|3.0|There was a time when you could rely on a bad action film to at least supply you with action. \\"The Expendables,\\" which is said to be an homage to the guy films of the 1980s and 1990s, doesn't give you action so much as a blur of images chopped together so badly, you can barely revel in the violence they're meant to depict. What's the point in creating scene after scene of shootings and stabbings and explosions when the camera doesn't linger long enough on the aftermath? Why take the time for stunt training when every punch, kick, and jab is at the mercy of lightning-quick cuts, each leading to all manner of odd angles that don't really reveal the brutal maneuvering? Did director/co-writer Sylvester Stallone think the screenplay was ready to be shot? Even if it was ready, did Stallone actually believe the finished film was the best it could possibly be?    \\"The Expendables\\" is loud, violent, and frenetic, qualities I might have gotten into had the stunts been edited in such a way that I could actually watch them. I wasn't seeing action choreography so much as a jumble of brutality and bloodshed. It seemed mangled, twisted, and deformed, like a fighters using his bare hands to punch solid brick walls. It's not a question of meaning or theme or symbolism; I didn't go into this movie expecting anything of the sort. What I did expect was to have fun, to be entertained by senseless yet well-photographed violent acts. Isn't that what action films are supposed to do?    But wait, I haven't even gotten to the story yet. That's because there really isn't one to speak of. At least, not one that could be considered important or even comprehensible. So far, I've established that there's no good action to gawk at, nor is there a plot that can reasonably be followed. So what do I have left? The dialogue? Sadly, no; at times, it's so awkward that it seems to have been borrowed from another screenplay altogether. What am I supposed to make of a moment early in the film when the title characters square off with a band of Somalian pirates, only for Jason Statham's cell phone to start buzzing? Not only is this painfully unfunny, it doesn't match the tone the scene had been setting up. The last thing this movie needs is a sense of humor. Give us all the blood and bullets and stabbings you want, but for the love of God, don't try to get yourself off the hook by telling a joke.    The plot, as it were, centers on a group of mercenaries led by Barney Ross (Stallone). The other members of his team are given irredeemably dumb names, such as Lee Christmas (Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and Toll Road (Randy Couture). They all have their areas of expertise. After the situation off the coast of Aden very nearly goes awry, it's decided that Gunnar - who just happens to be a sniper - needs to be kicked out, for it seems he's too emotionally unstable to continue being an Expendable. He leaves, dejected, determined to show Barney that his decision was the wrong one to make.    In due time, Barney and his team are recruited by the secretive Mr. Church (a cameo by Bruce Willis) to enter a fictional South American country and overthrow a ruthless dictator. During this recruitment scene, we're treated to a cameo appearance by Arnold Schwarzenegger, although it seems kind of strange, what with him being the Governor of California and all. This, coupled with his character's long-standing rivalry with Barney, allows for the film's one genuinely funny line of dialogue: As he exits the scene, Barney turns to Mr. Church and says, \\"He wants to be president.\\"    Back to the plot. In this fake South American country, called Vilena, Barney is driven to do right by their contact, a young woman named Sandra (Gisele Itié), although it's for reasons I don't think I should reveal. Barney and his team also learn that the targeted dictator, General Garza (David Zayas), is actually under the thumb of an ex-CIA agent named James Munroe (Eric Roberts), one of those wickedly evil caricatures that always has to say something witty before, say, shooting someone. Any connection to James Monroe, the fifth President of the United States? What about his 1823 introduction of the Monroe Doctrine, which stated that Americans would no longer meddle in the affairs of foreign countries, specifically in Europe? Never mind.    At Munroe's side are Wickham (Gary Daniels) - who's a toff one, he is - and Paine (Steve Austin), a gigantic brute of a henchman. They serve no real purpose other than doing all the physical things Munroe is unwilling to do.    Rounding out the cast is Mickey Rourke as Barney's mission coordinator, Tool, a pipe-smoking tattoo artist. He represents the film's sole engaging character, and he supplies us with one scene of such incredible emotion, dialogue, and depth, I'm tempted to suggest that it wasn't written by Stallone. How could it have been when the rest of the film was relentlessly brutal? I suspect \\"The Expendables\\" will please fans of manly-man action, although they would have to be willing to get past the horrendous editing, which doesn't do much to reveal the glorious bloodshed. Perhaps Stallone's real goal was to reunite with Dolph Lundgren and give Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts an excuse to once again be in the same film (unlike \\"The Pope of Greenwich Village,\\" however, they share absolutely no screen time). I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing. Then again, I wouldn't have skimped on the screenplay, either.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is an extremely well-produced and well-acted period drama.<br />I'm sure the plot and characters have been summarised many times already.<br />In comparison to other works by the same author, I think this a bit more serious and perhaps of interest to a wider audience. (To me it's a drama, with a bit of harsh reality, not just a romance story.)<br />The mini series is rich and complex enough to merit watching more than once. I liked the way things slowly transition from drab grey to more colourful as the story proceeds.<br />I particularly enjoyed watching Daniela Denby-Ashe in role of Margaret, in such stark contrast to the snarky trampy teenage Janey Harper she portrays in the sitcom \\"My Family\\".

If you're wearing this on a costume or light weight shirt, take a hint from a military guy and find some cardboard, stick this to the cardboard.  Cut out a backing around it, then when you wear it place the cardboard between the shirt and frogs (pin holders).  This keeps the pin from sagging on your shirt.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|Perhaps I should begin this review with some interesting facts about 2009's Up before even beginning to break down the nuts, bolts and personal opinions of the film.  Up represents director Pete Docter's first Pixar project since 2001's Monsters Inc, it was Pixar's first ever 3D film, it was the first Disney collaboration to earn a PG rating since Pixar's The Incredibles, it features Pixar's first Japanese/Asian-American character, it was the first Disney/Pixar film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture (only the second animated film ever to do that), and until Toy Story 3, it earned notoriety as the second most commercially successful Pixar work (behind Finding Nemo).  Now that's quite a bit of distinction!<br /><br />So what's with all the hype you ask? I can't be positive but in my opinion it is the least Pixar-like of all of the Pixar films.  How so? Well I typically associate the company with plot concepts so overly clever that they would be charming even if every other aspect of the film bombed (which has, to date, never happened in case you're wondering).<br /><br />Up is, well, different.  It starts out by recapping a very-human couple's lifespan then transforms into a fairly straightforward adventure story.  No monsters here, no robots, living toys, and even the talking animals are explained scientifically!<br /><br />Up is a comedy adventure about a 78-year-old widower and retired balloon salesman named Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), who finally fulfills a rather unorthodox lifelong dream of great adventure when he ties thousands of balloons to his house and sails toward the wilds of South America.  It is this flying house gimmick that will forever stick in the collective minds of the public (and inspired the film's title) but beyond the superficial there lies a pretty charming tale of the human condition that harkens back to vintage Disney in their 2D prime.<br /><br />Up opens by telling Carl's story with extraordinary tenderness and a sense of pacing that hints of a brisk, consistent emotionally charged story. However, the balloon driven air-abode represents the introduction to the second half of the film, which essentially transforms our gray-haired heart string tugger into a bit of a geriatric action hero; a sort of Indiana Jones' great grandfather if you will.<br /><br />Fortunately this is Pixar here people, and any doubts of pointless exposition are offset by the unique dynamic established when Carl finds himself an unintentional guardian of a boisterous young scout precisely 70-years his junior.<br /><br />This young Wilderness Explorer (think boy scouts without the legal snares for rights), Russell (Jordan Nagai), provides some wonderfully humorous moments that act as the perfect catalyst to bring out the comedic best from the ever-grumpy Carl.<br /><br />The visuals, which as is par for the course with the companies involved, are appropriately awesome with photo-realistic texturing, mind-boggling lighting effects, and characters positively charged with personality.<br /><br />The score comes from none other than living legend Michael Giacchino (no stranger to Pixar's scoring demands, having worked with them on The Incredibles & Ratatouille).  It is appropriately epic when need be and charmingly intimate when the film's proverbial heart calls for it.<br /><br />In all Up provides a very charming emotionally laced 96-minute joyride that manages to pack a whole lot of charm into what really boils down to a fairly straightforward adventure piece.  Like all of Pixar's works, it succeeds in providing something appealing to viewers from any conceivable age groups and does so with an effortlessness that hints to the reality that Pixar could very well be the best place to work in the whole world.sistent emotionally charged story.

In all Up provides a very charming emotionally laced 96-minute joyride that manages to pack a whole lot of charm into what really boils down to a fairly straightforward adventure piece.  Like all of Pixar's works, it succeeds in providing something appealing to viewers from any conceivable age groups and does so with an effortlessness that hints to the reality that Pixar could very well be the best place to work in the whole world.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I was fortunate enough to discover Yes shortly before this album was released. I was in 9th grade. At first I didn't care much for it; I put it away for many months until the darkening days of Autumn 1974 forced me into my northern US hibernation/introspection period. The more I listened to the album, the more I grew to love it, and I listened to it hundreds of times during my teen years.    Tales from Topographic Oceans is, in my opinion, the greatest rock album ever recorded. There is nothing that even comes close to it. Most Yes fans would probably rate Close to the Edge as their best album, and that, too, was a great album, but it lacks the maturity of Tales.    What sets Tales in a class by itself is the simple yet powerful fact that it is a purely spiritual rock album. This appears to go virtually unnoticed by both the album's advocates and its critics, but it is spelled-out in the liner notes preceding the lyrics in the original fold-out 33 rpm record album cover; the album was inspired by a footnote in Paramahansa Yogananda's spiritual classic Autobiography of a Yogi.     While much of the lyric content of the album is open to speculation about its meaning, much of it is also straightforward. \\"A part we offer is our only freedom\\" from the track 'The Revealing Science of God' speaks of our need to contribute something to society; we will not find freedom otherwise. The beginning of the track 'The Remembering' speaks of reincarnation, \\"As the silence of seasons on we relive\\" and even of remembering past lives as it continues from that point with \\"Abridge sails afloat.\\" There are many profound thoughts embedded in the lyrics.    And what are the \\"Topographic Oceans?\\" Listen to those musical interludes in 'The Remembering.' These musically capture the motion of the atmosphere (i.e. topographic oceans) and are capable of lifting one's consciousness right out of one's body into the \\"alternate view\\" (i.e. altered state of consciousness) mentioned in the lyrics. I would always listen to this album with headphones on, sitting and meditating on the music, trying to merge with it. One can actually feel what it feels like to rise and expand with one of those beautiful summer cumulus clouds; the music captures this perfectly. To this day I am still awed at how they got this on tape.    This album will still be a classic a hundred years from now. It might be that long before its worth is even begun to be realized.
0525951652|5.0|Great book as usual.  Ken Follett has a way of pulling you into his story.  Now I cannot wait to see what happens with \\"my people\\".
0307454541|5.0|This is one of those books that I couldn't put down.  It reads very fast, has a great plot and wonderful character development.  I just finished the 2nd book in the series in just two nights!
B003V5PPZG|3.0|Well, I'm a huge Linkin Park fan, and I have to admit, I'm a little disappointed with this album. Nearly half of the tracks are instrumental or vocal interludes. The other half are generally decent, except for 15. \\"The Messenger.\\" If you like acoustic songs, don't listen to this one. It will ruin them for you. If you don't like acoustic songs, then you'll simply be better off not even ripping it.<br /><br />However, this album isn't all bad. 5. \\"When They Come for me\\"  is a decent track, especially if you missed Mike Shinoda's rapping as much as I did. 8, 9, and 10 are all decent techno metal tracks, Tool style. 10. \\"Blackout\\"  in particular, has an interesting bridge.<br /><br />THE VERDICT: Listen to a few of these songs on YouTube before you buy this album. If you like them, buy it. Linkin Park is still a great band, even with their departure from the formula that sold their first two studio albums.<br /><br />6.5/10<br /><br />If you exclude 15. \\"The Messenger\\"<br />7.5/10
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Although sitcoms become predictable over the seasons, the premise for this one allows a lot of humor and novelty even into it's 3rd season.  The actors playing Penny and Sheldon are gifted physical comedians with impeccable timing.
B0038YWPZS|5.0|I remember trying to catch the movie on TV, but I always miss part of the movie. So I looked for it at Amazon so I could get it on DVD. It was on a discount. I finally got to watch the whole movie and loved it. How could you not like Patrick Swayze. I wanted this one because of the extra material that you get with it. I checked out the second disc and one of the things that they did was they got photos and videos from Dirty Dancing fans all over the country, to show how big a fan they are. It was really neat. I would recomend this to anyone who loves Patrick or a good romance movie. Nobody puts Baby in a corner.
0894803123|5.0|A friend made the ice cream from that book. Everyone wanted the recipe, thus the book was what we were told to buy. Cant wait for it to warm up for a batch.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Okay, so there are well over 150 reviews of the film posted already, so I don't need to go into details of the plot again. I was probably one of the few who did not see the film when it was released in theaters and so the DVD (not the Blu-ray) was my first chance to see it.<br /><br />While the name Disney is synonymous with  \\"Kid's movie\\", this one - like Up really hits the mark with adults - especially \\"baby boomers\\". Why? For a few reasons:<br /><br />1. The toys themselves are \\"baby boomer\\" icons: Mr. (and Mrs.) Potato Head, Slinky, Barbie and Ken and the very sly - and somewhat crude - reference to Lincoln Logs)<br /><br />2. There are way too many scary scenes - the final incinerator one, most of all - that look too realistic and will certainly scare children under 6 or 7.<br /><br />3. The script is written so to not bore the older viewers, but there are sections which little ones will find boring. And the viewer has to really understand the relationship of Barbie and Ken to get the many scenes they have. (And they are fun!)<br /><br />4. The Pixar detail is so wonderful and detailed - again the detail in the incinerator belt - that adults will be more impressed than children.<br /><br />5. Finally it'll be the adults who will relate to Andy having to leave his \\"pals\\" and will shed a tear at the end. (I certainly did).<br /><br />The bonus features on the DVD will also appeal to adults more than kids. The making of film, the short Pixar films and the brief \\"Buzz Lightyear\\" short made for NASA will be lost on any kids under 10.<br /><br />So, I'm here to rave about the film and encourage adults to buy this for themselves - even if they don't have children. Many of us grew up with these toys and they were our \\"friends\\". There's some nostalgia here as well as a great script, superb graphics (I watched on a standard def TV and it was still very sharp) and even some REALLY thrilling moments. Like Up, this will certainly make my Top Ten list this year!<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
0439023513|4.0|i am rarely moved to write a book review on the internet---but this series struck a cord with me--- and i feel the need to defend it.    i easily could have given this book one star---based solely on emotion.  if i had been holding the pen, i would have ended things much differently.  however-- ms. collins held it, and for good reason.    katniss's story has always been one of struggle, heartache, and perseverance.  anyone looking for a trite happy tale that blocked out the horrors of real life should have stopped reading the series several chapter into the first book.  this  is a story you have to understand to feel good about.    i longed for the characters to have a fairy-tale ending--- but as i closed the book at the end of mockingjay-- i realized that this isn't a fairy tale.  but more of a fable.  a lesson.  and lessons are hard to learn.    life is messy.  life hurts.   but there is always a sliver of hope.  a reminder that \\"life can go on\\".    and based on the cards dealt to these characters---a life to continue leading is more than they could have hoped for.    things aren't perfect.  and you don't close the book cheering (but read it anyway!).  you close it quiet.  with a tear in your eye.    but i think that's how collins wanted it.  and i think that's how katniss would want it to.    no fanfare.  just reality.   knowing that life can really, really suck.    but then you find a dandelion.
0805047905|4.0|This book is such a classic that I knew my daughter had to have it.  She is only 4-months old so she doesn't have a great attention span for books just yet, but when I read each animal's page in a different voice and make the sound each animal would make she sticks with it pretty well. I really like it!
B00000IBDY|5.0|Tomorrow decided to make two songs each independently,yet with the band backing them.The record company hated the idea.Originally ,it was to be Steve Tomorrow, Keith Tomorrow,and Juinor and Twink Tomorrow.The Aquarion age is Junior and Twink and the Keith West songs are actually all singles(his singles) and their flipsides,(stemming from the 'Teenage Opera' stuff),like 'On a Saturday',with the B-side of 'The kid was a killer'.Steve plays guitar on all of these, and I only remembered 'On a Saturday'.However,there are two Howe songs missing,that were not released.Actualy ,two versions of the same instrumental,'Mothballs',or 'So Bad'.Wonder why they left his off? 'So bad', is all insrumental,and if you are a Howe fan you will like it.'Mothballs',is the same song with everyone laughing ,yelling and generally cutting up,and with Steve say'ing \\"mothballs\\", occasionly. There is a 1994 release,called 'Mothballs',of all of Steve's early stuff(or a lot of it),by RPM. They recieved 'So Bad',from EMI's vaults for the album (in liners),so they had it .It seems odd ,that unless you are English like me ,they would put extras of all the people noone else knew of, and leave off the one who became famous worldwide.I liked Keith just fine, but my German(I am half German),and American friends only know Howe,and the album is actually titled,'Tomorrow with Keith West'.Anyway,if you are a Howe fan 'Mothballs'is certainly worth money, as it begins @ age 15 with 'The Syndicats',and runs through a bit of 'Bodast', his last band before 'Yes'.If you have not heard 'Bodast',it is interesting to here some \\"pieces\\" of 'Yes',played earlier on these 'Bodast' tunes.Most notably, 'Starshiptropper'..RPM also has a newer version of the Bodast album,(done in '68 and '69,but not released until '81).The '81 version is,the original album, but \\"cleaned up\\" by Howe.I had heard of them ,but never heard them ,until '81 when I came upon the 'LP', in France,and always loved it.The newest one has some extras,butwhat really makes it better is the \\"not cleaning up\\".It is all from the original soundboards,and sounds somehow more \\"real\\" for the time.If you enjoy Tomorrow ,check out Bodast they may just become you're new favourite band.Both of the RPM versions mentioned ,are available here and at very little cost.
B003WTE886|4.0|With Speak Now, Taylor Swift could grow a little bit more, with lyrics that says that she's a full grown woman now, but still have somethings to learn.  The first single of the album \\"Mine\\" is a great song, speaks about a true love and how it comes up to age when you know the right person and wants to spend your hole life with the ideal guy.  Don't get me wrong, but still sounds a little bit girlie to me, after all, she spent 2 full years writing these songs and our lives can change drastically in 2 years.  For instance, listen to \\"Back To December\\" track when she says \\"Forgive me\\" to some old boyfriend, as if anybody knows that she's talking about the Twilight Saga wolf's Taylor Lautner.  And don't get me wrong, I love Taylor Swift and I'm a huge fan of hers but I still want something more edgier.  Maybe in the next album.
0061433047|4.0|The blurb inside the cover says \\"chilling drama combines with laugh out-loud humor and searing insight.\\" That pretty much describes the book, as well as the whole Tiffany Aching series. In fact, it describes most of Pratchett's Discworld novels.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy this book as much as the other Tiffany Aching novels, and the ending was somewhat anticlimactic and even a bit confusing. But still a recommended read.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|The cooler works great,  cooling a hot running Phenom X4 9850!  But after I took my entire system apart to upgrade the case and the CPU Cooler I was stopped in my tracks by the fact that one of the four 4mm nuts that are included to secure the mounting bracket to the MB was not tapped correctly. Because of this I had wait until the next day to find a useable one at True Value.   It looked okay but to work it needed to be retapped to the correct size.
B002ZG981E|5.0|One thing I honestly love are movies that make you think. And THIS MOVIE DELIVERS! I simply loved this movie. The concept is totally mind-bending and suspenseful! Leonardo DiCaprio is in top form and Christopher Nolan's direction is once again spectacular! But I MUST mention that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a revelation! This guy has grown into one of today's excellent actors! (this movie is just a taste of what he can do. If you really want to see his breakout role, rent or buy \\"The Lookout\\"! An amazing film that should not be missed!!)I know it may be a far reach, but it's too bad  (from what I hear) that Nolan's next \\"Dark Night\\" feature does not feature The Riddler, because I here to tell you that Joseph Gordon-Levitt would DEFINITELY fit the biil! He would make an excellent Riddler to go toe-to-toe with Christian Bale. I beleive he would fit that role and do what Heath Ledger did so amazingly with The Joker! Hands-Down!! Just a thought. But, see this movie! Inception is a revelation that should not be missed!! A Great Movie and A Great Cast All Around!!

0439023513|4.0|I normally try to stay away from spoilers in reviews but with this one it was pretty difficult to do that. Suzanne Collins created a world that many could have never imagined, but through her words she painted a picture of Panem, its districts, and the characters that live there. This series captured so many who fell in love with Katniss, Peeta, Gale and the others who make up this incredible story.<br /><br />The way Suzanne Collins tells a story blows me away. She isn't afraid to talk about difficult topics or show the hard facts of violence. The depth and heartache of her characters can be felt on each page. Mockingjay continued with the pattern we saw in the previous books and carried on with the story of Katniss as she struggles with everything going on around her.<br /><br />* Spoilers *<br />Mockingjay, like the other books in The Hunger Games series, deals with war, violence, and loss. These difficult topics are handled in a way that I can only describe as \\"real\\". I did completely enjoy this book and it kept me gripped to the pages but I don't feel totally satisfied after reading it. Even with that, I gave it 4 stars because it goes so far beyond typical books and the story is still one of the best I have ever read.<br /><br />First, the characters seemed more \\"disconnected\\" to me. They had very little interaction, and when they did, it was awkward or seemed forced. I missed the love Katniss had for Peeta and Gale. I didn't see the passion, the commitment, the fire that was in the previous books. I think the main reason for that was Katniss. She seemed depressed (which was completely understandable after all she had been through); however, I thought it made things a little more difficult to follow. At times the book skipped entire parts because she was gone or unconscious. She just seemed on autopilot.<br /><br />The only spark of enjoyment I saw was with her interaction with Finnick. I truly enjoyed Finnick's character and the life he gave to the story. Mockingjay was so focused on the war and violence, I felt it lacked in personal enjoyment. I do understand that in Katniss's case little can be enjoyed, but for me, I needed something to hope for throughout the book.<br /><br />Now, for the ending. I didn't mind the story of the Epilogue and thought it ended nicely, however, where was Gale? It was like they said \\"oh, he works somewhere else now.\\" and POOF he was forgotten. I am Team Peeta all the way but c'mon, Gale was Katniss's best friend for years! He can't just be forgotten like that. Where's the Gale love?<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, I truly loved the book! I just felt that The Hunger Games and Catching Fire created a story that just didn't seem to go as well with this one. Plus, final books carry a certain expectation and it can be difficult to find closure at the end of any series. I'm still a total Hunger Games fan and would read anything Suzanne Collins wrote. This story portrays many harsh realities that are not seen in other YA books and she did this with an incredible grace. Katniss is one of my favorite characters of all time and her fire and courage is beyond comparison.and violence, I felt it lacked in personal enjoyment.

B003VS0CXS|5.0|A must for us and our grand children! The quality of the video and audio did not disappoint, not even a little bit. I loved it, my kids loved it, and my grand kids thought it was the most fun movie they had ever seen. Do yourself a favor and buy it and enjoy the trip back to a special time in your life.
B00003CX9W|5.0|The DVD itself is in fine shape I received it in no time at all.  I am very happy with the result. This movie brings back such memories! I first saw it in a tiny theater in Batavia New York and it blew me away.  The dvd  is awesome the artistry is astounding the animation is classic Disney at it's best.  In the three weeks since I've gotten this dvd in the mail  I've watched it  five times and it thrills and astounds me each and every time.
0385342047|1.0|I have read all of the books in Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series.  I enjoyed them in the beginning, but I found the last two to be repetitive and boring.  How many times can someone manipulate and lie her way out of a situation before it catches up to her?  Apparently, there are no limits to that for Becky Bloomwood Brandon.  I found this book boring and disappointing.  Becky and Luke are raising a spoiled brat.  If Ms. Kinsella continues the series, Minnie will grow up to be more self-absorbed and obnoxious than her mother.  It was hard to read, and I would not recommend this book.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|Tom believes that when he meets the woman of his dreams he will know it immediately. When Tom meets Summer he falls head over heals for her.  Summer is the woman he knows was meant for him.  The only problem is that Summer does not believe that falling in love with another human being is possible.  When they meet each other Summer tells him this right away.  This does not prevent Summer and Tom from eventually become close friends and seemingly lovers.  Tom has the fantasy that Summer will eventually reciprocate the same love for him that he feels for her.  Unfortunately, Summer cannot be moved.<br /><br />\\"500 Days of Summer\\" is told in random order, from beginning to end.  Each day of their relationship is identified.  This technique works really well because like Tom, when people reminise about a past relationship they often think of the great times, which stand out, but do so in no particular order.  Sticking to this \\"rule\\" I never had any difficulty following the film.<br /><br />The acting of the male and female leads is right on.  Despite Tom's knowing all along that Summer would never fall in love with him, Tom keeps plugging away at his dream.  In the last part of this wonderful, funny and insightful film, Tom comes to his senses and is finally able to separate reality from fantasy.  No relationship is ever pre-destined and occasional reality testing can save someone from a lot of grief and unnecessary disappointment.

142311339X|5.0|i have read the Percy Jackson series as well as the Red Pyramid.  i must say, among all of these i find The Lost Hero the best.  there's a sense of urgency at the same time the characters seem like they are on the cusp of adulthood unlike Percy's series which, though also dealing with teen love, seemed younger at all points.  you never know where the characters are going in this book, the choices they are to make and their feelings for one another....except for Piper's of course.  the ending is great.  makes me want to rush the months so i can read the next.  i can't imagine how the percy angle would go from hereon so kudos to Rick Riordan.  i await with bated breath.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|There's a lot of carping from people, crying about being suckered into a double and triple dip with buying multiple versions of this movie. A lot of people are bellyaching about the fact it's still not released in 3D yet.    Here's a reality check. 3D TVs aren't that common yet. The major players have them available, but it's still a new technology. To put out a release in a format that's brand new, where there are still \\"standards\\" for how it works on hardware from different manufactures still being ironed out, would be stupid for anyone to do.    When the 3D release comes out, from what I'm reading in the trade mags, is that it will only work on one brand 3D TV set for the time being. Again, this is still brand new technology, so until ALL the manufactures of hardware and playback codecs get their act together and agree on an actual, working standard, you'll have to wait it out, or go buy a new 3D TV that will work with this release when it comes out.    If you bought the DVD version, and or the previous Bluray version, go set up an account at Ebay and sell them. Then your soul won't feel so drained that you keep buying versions of it that you really don't want to own.     Really, this is a ground breaking movie on so many levels, it's one of the few movies I've ever plunked down money to own a copy for myself for repeated viewing. And when the 3D version comes out, I won't be buying a copy.  I poked out an eyeball as a kid, so I can't see in 3D. But if I could, I'd find someone with a 3D TV and spend a weekend wearing out his bluray player.    Edited to add: I'm seeing numerous complaints of there not being a digital version, which I'm guessing is for other electronic viewing devices. This is probably the last movie that should be seen on a tiny little screen, what's the point?
B003DT19F0|5.0|I absolutely loved watching this with my young daughter. It's just delightful, colorful, and fun! What is also very nice is there's nothing scary in it-just some peril, but a lil' peril makes for a good story. Highly recommended for young kids and girls of all ages. :)
B004C5K3FG|5.0|This season keeps bringing in old faces and new surprises. I absolutely loved this episode for a number of reasons. We get to see that Lois's mother is played by the actress, Teri Hatcher, who played Lois herself in the 90's series, \\"Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\\" and we also got to see both of Clark's parents together. My favorite thing about this episode was the background storyline we got to see on Tess Mercer. Wow. What a shocking ending that was! This is easily the best season yet for Smallville and I love the direction each storyline is headed. Superior job!

B000Q66PXE|5.0|Amazing show, too bad it was canceled to make room for the crap HBO now has on. OMG vampires ftw lol!
B004AKCME8|4.0|\\"Legend of the Guardians\\" is a brilliant creation, telling how \\"The Guardians,\\" a flock of \\"good owls,\\" foil the plans of \\"The Pure Ones,\\" a flock of \\"evil owls,\\" to rule the owl world. What they can't do with modern technology! Many times you'd swear these really were live, movie-screen sized talking owls -- with very expressive eyes that show emotion more clearly than those of many human actors. The dialogue, done by actors with British accents, is imaginative, in that the \\"good\\" owls talk like what I would imagine middle-class Britons sound, the plug-ugly \\"bad\\" owls, in a very broad cockney, and the \\"rulers\\" of The Pure Ones, like members of the nobility. It adds a lot to the story, as given the setting and situations, American accents would have grated on the ear.     A few quibbles: Sometimes it's hard to tell which group of owls a particular creature belongs to; the plot can be a little difficult to follow at times; and the mid-air battles between owls, or groups of same, feature such rapid jump-cutting that a certain amount of the action is lost to viewers unless their eyes are much quicker than my aging ones.     And, here's my main problem with what is otherwise a fine animated feature: Can't filmmakers ever get over the \\"Nazi template\\" and move on to some other type of villain? The group name \\"The Pure Ones\\" is obviously intended to conjure up visions of the Third Reich's race-based ideology. One scene shows the chief villain, making a stentorian speech to a crowd of his followers, and we're supposed to think of Adolf Hitler, thundering at a Nazi rally. An elderly, battle-hardened \\"good owl\\" has facial features and speech patterns that fairly shout \\"Winston Churchill.\\" As depicted in history books and World War II documentaries, Hitler and his Nazis apparently have left us so handy an image of an \\"evil regime\\" that filmmakers can't resist returning to it, again and again.     Nevertheless, that's a matter of my own personal preferences. I would definitelyrecommend this movie to those who enjoy a whacking good adventure story, done in modern animated form.
B00461BQC0|1.0|Have seen them play three small venues over the years. Some absolutely mind-blowing live-shows that made me a huge fan.  The amazing chemistry of the band during those shows reflected their stand-alone raw talent,energy, and artistry.  The first three albums they put out were ripped to disc, cracked/scratched/loaned-out,worn-out, broken, burned to disc and worn out again.  Could not get enough of the sound these guys were laying down.      So I've got to say that it blows my mind that Rolling Stone gave this album 4-stars and 'Aha Shake Heartbreak' only 3. As for this album and the better part of the last one, they've taken a turn that has steadily moved them farther away from the dynamic, powerful, and original sound they are capable of.    If these guys disappear for a while and tap back-in to what is real and what they're capable of, then I'll be glad to buy another album.  Until then I'm gonna have to pass, and just keep rockin' their old-stuff
B003WTE886|4.0|I have been a fan of Taylor since her debut album and have been wanting to write a review of this CD for a while as I think there is a lot to be said about it.    For those who are familiar with Taylor's past albums, I would say that you will find in some of the songs the familiar Taylor you have come to know and love, and in others, an entirely new style.     Songs:    There is a large selection - 14 songs, the most of any of her albums so far - and quite a variety in terms of style. Some songs have a more obvious country feel, which is refreshing, while others are very much pop (ex.: \\"The Story of Us\\", \\"Better than Revenge\\", \\"Haunted\\").     With Taylor's past two albums, the albums as a whole were good, and though this one is good as well, because of the significant differences in the songs' paces and styles, some songs stand out more than others and the album in general may take a bit more getting used to. I have also found some of the songs that are different from her usual style to remind me of other artists (ex.: The chorus in \\"Haunted\\" makes me think of Kelly Clarkson). There are several more serious songs on this album - I wasn't sure the album left me feeling as happy and trying to determine the tone/mood of the album as a whole, as opposed to each individual song, proved a bit challenging - but rest assured there are feel-good songs as well.      Many of Taylor's songs have been clever, playful and generally wholesome, but you will find some deeper emotions and also some direct putting of people in their places on this album (\\"Better than Revenge\\": no mincing words there!).    \\"Long Live\\", the last track on the CD, is reminiscent of \\"Change\\" from her last album \\"Fearless\\" (in terms of an anthem-like feel), which also happened to be the last song on the album. I have to admit it is one I have been skipping, and that I feel is a bit of a filler song in that the album would likely not have been affected if the song was removed.        Some of my personal favorites include: Mine, Speak Now, Dear John, Mean, Last Kiss.    Lyrics:    Taylor's songwriting talent is obvious once again, and there are some very good lines throughout the album.     \\"...I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how  I've never heard silence quite this loud...\\"    \\"...Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame  Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away...\\"    \\"...I'm shining like fireworks  Over your sad empty town...\\"    As with past albums' booklets, you will find Taylor's always-fun-to-decipher trademark in her lyrics.      Vocals:    Taylor is in my opinion a very good recording artist. On this album, different songs reveal a new side of Taylor's vocals, whether slight or more pronounced (ex.: \\"Speak Now\\", \\"Haunted\\", \\"Last Kiss\\"). I have found that she has stretched herself vocally on this new release - you will hear her sing in ways and with more power than on past albums.     Overall:    This is one of those albums that could potentially be a gamble for some and may not please everyone in its entirety, but I think her fans will respect her desire to explore new styles and I think she will gain new fans with this album. You will find good melodies, lyrics, vocals, and some styles you are not quite used to coming from Taylor, but overall this is another solid release which I think will continue to draw her the praise and recognition she deserves. And true to her album title, Taylor is speaking out and not holding back on this one, and that is perhaps the best way to sum up \\"Speak Now\\".
1400079144|1.0|Dan Brown's third Robert Langdon thriller was everything I thought it would be and more....contrived, hackneyed, and thoroughly predictable.     I realize in picking up a Dan Brown book that I open the cover with a preconceived notion that I won't really enjoy it. I have given very little 'praise' in my reviews of the other two Langdon books written prior to this one.  And though I did enjoy the 'story' of Angels and Demons more than that of Da Vinci Code, and wish I had read A&D first and then stopped reading any further, I did pick up Lost Symbol from a used book store shelf thinking that perhaps 'the third time would be the charm'.    Wrong.    Setting this story against the backdrop of Washington D.C. and the myriad of 'secrets' buried there by the founding fathers and Freemasons in existence at the time the city was built, Langdon is once again drawn into a world of secret societies, hidden agendas, and a dastardly villain who sets out to wreak havoc on the lives of many.  Of course this plot will sound familiar....it is the same as the plot of the two predecessor stories involving Langdon.    I am most definitely a fan of historical mysteries and thrillers....of long-buried secrets that resurface years later and threaten the fabric of contemporary society with their 'revelations'. I have to give Brown credit for choosing interesting 'topics' for his works.  But that is, really, the most I can give him credit for after reading three of his books.    Langdon, this time, is summoned to speak as guest lecturer at a conference in D.C. by his friend and mentor Peter Solomon.  Upon his arrival in D.C. Langdon is immediately thrust into another 'life or death' situation when he realizes that the invitation he received didn't come from Peter himself...but from someone with a far more dangerous agenda than just information sharing.     Langdon partners with Peter's sister, Katherine, in a high speed race against time to deliver to the 'villain' of the piece what he wants - the location of the Freemasons' 'Hidden Temple' in D.C. - Langdon reluctantly begins to decode the symbols which will supposedly lead him to the temple's location....even though he has absolutely no belief that the temple actually exists.   Yet, in order to save the life of his friend, Langdon and Katherine follow the trail that becomes littered with bodies as they slowly come to realize that perhaps this fabled temple is not such a fable after all.    Peppered with some interesting and entertaining 'facts', this story is really just a re-hash of Langdon's prior adventures without the foreign locations.  Take one brilliant 'scientist'...throw in an equally brilliant and beautiful female sidekick.....add a villain or two....and top it off with an historical 'mystery'...and you have each and every one of the three Langdon novels thus far.    I hesitate to say that, if one is written, I will bother with another of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon novels. Starting out with Angels and Demons, the best written of the three (and that's not saying much, really) it's all downhill from there.
B00402FGEE|5.0|Stargate is one of those shows in the beginning I never thought would last. Thankfully this is a time I do not mind being wrong. Universe is the third in the franchise and the unlike the first two; it left the well known path that was set by its predecessors. A younger cast with new ideas and slower pace to get to know your characters really sets this apart and sometimes does not feel like your watching Stargate. For some this can be a breath of fresh air. For others this will keep them away from the show. I encourage all that enjoy sci fi to give this a chance.
0440423023|5.0|I love action thrillers. They are fast moving, clever, with plots that twist and turn like a disco dancer. The guru of this genre is Lee Child and his character Jack Reacher is the unmitigated king. He usually publishes one Jack Reacher novel a year, but this year, his fans got two. What a wonderful year.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is handsome in a XXX scruffy sort of way, a highly-skilled fighter, can read people like a Monday morning quarterback and has the bias for action we admire in others. His early life was spent in military intelligence, with many awards chronicling his success. When he retired, he became a drifter, walking across America, getting to know the country he never knew as a child. He's a man's man (quiet, doesn't say much, accepting), strong, damaged by life, but without self-pity. He enables us his readers to try out traits that we wouldn't have the courage to embrace in real life. For example, own nothing. Reacher owns only what he can carry. He buys his clothes cheap and tosses them when they get dirty. His mind is always open to the world around him and he always takes time to explore--a trait we encourage in our children and denigrate in adults. Jack shows us how to do it and make it work.<br /><br />Reacher accepts whatever life throws his way, which may explain why Lee Child names his alter ego's books with fatalistic phrases like Bad Luck and Trouble. Die Trying. Nothing to Lose. Gone Tomorrow.<br /><br />And The Hard Way. This is one of the best in the series. The essence of a Jack Reacher story is Reacher as puzzle master. He ends up in the middle of a plot with clues scattered like breadcrumbs. Something catches his attention. Reacher has a few hot buttons, such as mistreatment of military vets or dogs or children. It could be one of those or something else, but once it's on his radar, he doesn't let go until he's put each puzzle piece in its rightful spot. He never runs out of ideas. If one fails, he tries another. Usually, he solves the mystery quickly. Sometimes, it takes longer. In The Hard Way, nothing worked for our hero. By the end of novel, just in time for the climax, Jack came up with one more solution, which he called the Hard Way. I won't spoil it for you, but it brings to mind a time in every person's life when Plan A failed, then Plan B failed, and like dominoes, our world crumbled until all that was left was Plan Z.<br /><br />That's the Hard Way.<br /><br />I had one of those recently. I had to print one hundred fifty-page booklets for a presentation. My usual printer couldn't do it, so I decided to use my business laser printer. First I ran out of ink, so had to order more (that's right. Staples didn't carry them). When the toner arrived, my printer broke. I bought a new printer, started all over, but toner prices for new printers were so high, my booklets were going to cost $20 each--beyond my budget. So I went in search of a cheaper printer. Ten days later, I had those darn booklets, but I'd gotten them The Hard Way.<br /><br />That's what I mean. And once Jack Reacher starts, he doesn't lose.<br /><br />I wish I could read that book again for the first time. Rarely does a book speak to me so personally about problem solving and life and the human penchant for tenacity. Did you read it? What did you think?mes, it takes longer.

B000002P2W|5.0|This is one underrated album by The Who. It seems like everyone always talks about either Who's Next or Quadrophenia. But By Numbers is a bit better than both of those albums: not only is it the band's most personal album, but it's also one of their more diverse albums. The songs are never the same (not to say that the other albums were the same, but this one is just slightly more distinctive). And not only that, the songs are purely awesome and inspirational. Songs like \\"Imagine A Man,\\" \\"Dreaming from the Waist,\\" and \\"They Are All In Love\\" are very meaningful: you can tell in the lyrics that everyone in the band was having problems with each other (as well as the music industry, youth, & life in general). \\"Slip Kid\\" is absolutely my personal favorite from The Who: it's melodic and very significant about the dark side of the music industry. \\"Squeeze Box\\" is probably the most famous song on the album, but personally, I think it's a bit overrated (it's still good, though). Actually, the only song that I truly dislike is \\"However Much I Booze,\\" and it's not even THAT terrible to start with.<br /><br />I still don't understand why The Who By Numbers is still underrated after all these years. But whatever the reason, I hope it will be appreciated even more in the future.<br /><br />Grade: 9.2/10
1593272200|5.0|I can't imagine how much work went into producing this volume.

B00003CX8N|5.0|Anyone who knows London knows and loves Charing Cross Road that has been able to resist any kind or urban change, even recent urban renovation, since I first stepped into it in 1960. I have walked it up to Tottenham Court Station and Road and down to Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery more often than Champs Elys&eacute;es in Paris or Broadway in New York. It is for me one street I love discovering every single time I am in London with all its book stores, Covent Garden on one side and Soho on the other side, Leicester square on that other side, and the National gallery at the bottom of the street not to speak of Saint Martin's in the Fields and its underground crypt where you can eat with the ghosts. Fifty years haunting that place, that road, its shops, theaters, churches and left or right hinterlands. The Strand next to it is nothing and I can live without ever setting one toe of one foot in it, but Charing Cross Road... This film is thus nostalgic about what it was, and still is, in spite of the death of two people and the closing of Marks books that I actually visited before it closed, or it might be another one, they were and are all just as beautiful and intriguing. But the film is not about nostalgia for some place you have visited and loved, not even a person you have loved and lived with in a way or another, but about a service you can only get from true secondhand bookstores because they don't sell books but they sell the books they love and cherish to people who love and cherish them just the same. These secondhand bookstores and booksellers have a charm that is not only quaint but is like an accomplice-ship in the crime of loving books, old books, beautiful books, books that have been used, visited and read by what we imagine are hundreds of people. The last book I got from England is from the University Library of Leeds, still with its barcode, its number, its Reference tag, its \\"not to be borrowed\\" tag and a book that was published in 1960, precisely, fifty years ago, a book no one can find any more except in university libraries and I have it on my desk, as if I had borrowed it and forgotten to give it back and left the country with it. That's what a second hand book is, and that's what this film is trying to make you feel by exploring the feelings of the bookseller and the customer, one in New York and the other in London, sharing (a perfect word for Charing Cross Street) the love of old books and the hunt and chase for them and the pleasure of a capture that can never be planned out and foreseen. No one can imagine what it means to hold an original edition of Walter Scott's novels and the communion with all those who have turned the fragile pages. Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins are rendering these feelings intertwined with real events from 1949 to the early 1960s, care packages and one coronation, plus plenty of New Year celebrations and Christmases, and we feel that spiritual love adventure among several grownups who will never meet and who are bringing together emotions and passions all connected to those books and the help one can bring to all the others in their hopes and sufferings. You will definitely see more of London than New York but London is the main character brought to life by two great actors and a sweet story.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDfifty years ago, a book no one can find any more except in university libraries and I have it on my desk, as if I had borrowed it and forgotten to give it back and left the country with it.

B00007KMP1|5.0|Wow- I've had a DVD-A (96/24 hi-res audio) copy of this for many years at this point, but have only been able to listen to this in lossy dts or DolbyDigital 3/2 surround (I forget which) since I didn't have a DVD audio player. Now that I *finally* have a copy of this in hi-res SACD (which I can play)- and in multi-channel no less- I can tell you this is truly a great title on so many levels.    The material itself is very haunting for me (I have always loved it)... I don't know if there was something bad going on in my life at the time when I first got this title- but there was something about this music that just stuck with me over time- I always feel like I'm going back to a troubled time when I listen to it, yet I always come back to the disc for more. The SACD version- with the multi-channel mix- is simply awesome... the surround mix is great- VERY nice use of the surrounds (don't have to strain to hear them), and the hi-res SACD audio just brings everything out in this fantastic title. It really doesn't get much better than this- at least not in my opinion.    My recommendation? If you have a SACD player- and any sort of multi-channel playback system- then pick up a copy of this disc before they're all gone. You can get a used copy for a decent price when they show up... or a new copy for some pretty serious bucks if you prefer. Either way you won't be disappointed... just check out some of the other reviews of this great title and you'll see what I mean.

B0040YFR1Y|5.0|After reading dozens of reviews panning \\"Predators\\", I ended up waiting for the film to begin at home with a bit of trepidation. As soon as the pre-title sequence began, however, I knew this was going to be a fantastic film. From the pre-title getting-dropped-into-the-jungle sequence to the very last line (and the credits song, Little Richard's \\"Long Tall Sally\\"), this film made my confidence in critics drop forever.    Explaining the plot would give quite a bit away - those you think will die don't, those you believe will survive don't, and the little twist toward the end threw me off because of what I perceived as lack of foreshadowing (but then, watching the film a second time, I saw that the foreshadowing was subtle and well-done, if you're paying attention). The film as a whole isn't a hack-and-slash with unecessary gore, and even the language didn't feel out of place. The one true scream of terror in the entire film is entirely justified in-context. The plot is intelligent. The cinematography is beautiful and truly gives a feeling of being on an empty world - a Predator game preserve - many light-years from Earth.    Though nothing quite compares to the original film that this is a sequel to, \\"Predators\\" still gives a worthy performance than occasionally challenges the original film's standing. From the familiar yet not-overdone score (so many memories) to the exotic vistas and colorful chemistry of the characters, none of whom are either boring or unecessary, \\"Predators\\" is a near-flawless sequel and certainly one of the must-sees of 2010.

0380789035|4.0|I'm giving it 3.75 stars. I'll have to round it up to 4 on my review, since Amazon won't let us do fractions of stars, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the other books that I've rated 4 stars, so I don't really want to give it a full 4 stars. But 3 isn't enough, as that would be just average, and American Gods is above average.<br /><br />I think that my main problem with it is just a matter of personal preferences. It is raw and gritty, sometimes even grotesque. I guess I must read to escape to some extent, because I like to see at least some beauty in the books I read. And that goes double for fantasy books - where so much is possible, and which are a REALLY great escape from everyday life. I don't mean that I would want a fantasy book to be all sweet and pretty; that would be cloying. But there is no beauty at all in American Gods, I found it ugly and depressing. For comparison, The Book of Flying by Keith Miller comes to mind. In that book, there are some chapters that cover some very ugly subjects, but Miller is able to find some kind of beauty - and make the reader see it - in even the most horrifying or sordid things. Whereas Gaimon does just the opposite in American Gods, taking subjects such as magic and the divine and making them sordid, ugly, and everyday.<br /><br />Coming back to that preferences thing, I also prefer books that give me insight into life and/or the human mind. I like a lot of character development; and events or quotes that get me thinking. American Gods is more about action - chases, fights, strategy, etc. The reader never feels a connection with any of the characters, or even that you know them well or understand them.<br /><br />However, the book is well-written and well-developed. I do not agree with others who have complained about offensive language. Gaiman is writing about convicts, lowlifes, scam artists, etc. Sorry folks, but that's the way such people really talk. To write it any other way would be unrealistic and prissy. Gaiman does not use vulgar vocabulary excessively - in fact, in my opinion, he shows some restraint in how often he uses it. The real people I have known that are similar in type to the characters in American Gods swear a whole LOT more!<br /><br />The book is well-organized, and in an interesting and unusual way. Like Coraline, it has a surreal feel. Some of my favorite parts of the book were the historical vignettes which tell about the various people who brought the gods to America when they came. In those, he is able to portray the times, cultures, character, and beliefs of those people quite vividly in short anecdotes. Impressive.<br /><br />My attitude toward the book changed near the end. The rest of the book had failed to draw me in. For something like 500 pages, I slogged through it. But in the last several chapters, it really picked up, and suddenly (and finally!) I wanted to keep reading. The ending draws together all the numerous, disparate, and seemingly rather random characters and events in an elegant way. Everything suddenly begins to make sense - even though the story veers off into unexpected twists and new directions. (For example, throughout the book, the mythology is of pagan gods, but at the end there is an implied but clear Christian element. I found that juxtaposition intriguing and creative.) The last several chapters are surprising and delightful.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I'd say that American Gods is an excellent book, just not my thing. I suspect that many other readers would rate it a full 4 or even 5 stars, and I wouldn't argue with that. I don't like to be sexist, but in all honesty, I think that this book would probably appeal more to male readers than to women like me.<br /><br />I'd especially recommend American Gods to readers who liked Small Gods, by Terry Pratchett. And vice versa.cabulary excessively - in fact, in my opinion, he shows some restraint in how often he uses it.

Its at this point that humanity finds something that rocks the foundation of humanities beliefs and points towards one of saturns moons where humanity is just becoming capable of reaching.<br /><br />This book was a fairly good read and it is amazing how some of our current technology could have been predicted so clearly at the time this book was written.<br /><br />Also from reading this book I see where a lot of ideas from this book are now seen all over Scifi Tv series and modern movies. This book was groundbreaking and prophetic.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|Earlier I had a VISIO cable which was priced about 30$.   I bought this cable and when I opened the box, the cable felt like way premium quality for half the price I paid for visio.  This cable is hard, premium shielding and works awesome. No loss of quality, or maybe it would be even an upgrade if i can say that.     The only thing I am not yet able to confirm is the Anynet+ feature/ CEC part of this cable since I dont have a compatible TV.     I am putting 2 more orders to have PS3 to AV and AV to TV connected by this cable.
0439023521|5.0|I am a middle school teacher and while I certainly recommend this for OLDER teens, it is an excellent book. It will keep women, men, and teens alike in suspense. Would certainly recommend this book.
B000X107GI|5.0|Got 5 batteries that certainly look like an original maxell product, hologram and all. The seller is mybatterysupplier. Cheaper than a single battery in a regular store. Shipping was fast too. I don't think I'll be commenting on the battery life considering I am using it in a watch, but works well now.
0393338959|1.0|Do not buy this book. The author is boringly repetitive. I quit reading it after 80 pages because he keeps repeating himself. He should retire.[[ASIN:0393338959 Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy]]
B003EYVY04|4.0|I'm only slightly disappointed with this product. I didn't realize, before buying it, that there wasn't an extended version in this one which was a huge selling point for me with the first two. However, I am still happy with the special features that are on them I just wish that they would continue with the extended movies.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book is just so great.  Interesting and suspensful, I couldn't put it down until it was finished and then I read it again.  The author had come to my school to sign autographs, so I reluctantly read it so I would at least know what she was talking about.  I am glad I did and am conpletely impressed.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|This ebook was easy to read and looked good on Kindle 3. It does however not have markers for chapters, and there are no illustrations, but all in all it is a good Kindle edition compared to many others I've seen where the formatting is strange.    The story of course is the same lovely classic Christmas story, and I recommand reading this original text even if you are familiar with the story already from film&TV.
0743270754|5.0|This is by no means a comprehensive review, as I've not finished the book, but I can already tell you that so far, this is one of the best books I've ever read.      The author is an absolutely fantastic writer - I don't know HOW she does it, but she does it very, very well.    Even if you're not particularly a history buff, this book makes such fascinating reading that I am enthralled.  The author makes the history come alive as if you were actually there to witness the events yourself.  She has a way of engaging the reader by weaving together the events with extremely detailed portraits of the personal lives of the people involved, including their early lives and familial relationships, their married lives, friendships, and relationships with their political friends and rivals.    She puts the events and personalities of the people into a precise historical perspective and context that helps you understand not only what happened, but also the motivations of the people involved. In other words, why they acted as they did.  For example, in writing about the four main characters (Lincoln, Salmon Chase, Edward Bates, and Henry Seward), she chronicles their motivations in seeking political careers into the context of the history of their day:      \\"The observation... that 'any man's son may become the equal of any other man's son', propelled thousands of young men to break away from the small towns and limited opportunities their fathers had known.  These ambitious youngsters ventured forth to test their luck in new careers as merchants, manufacturers, teachers, and lawyers.  In the process, hundreds of new towns and cities were born, and with the rapid expansion of roads, bridges, and canals, a modern market economy emerged. Vast new lands and possibilities were opened when the Louisiana Purchase doubled the extent of America's territorial holdings overnight.  These four men and thousands more, were not searching for some mythical pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but for a place where their dreams and efforts would carve them a place in a fast-changing society.\\"  (from Chapter 2 \\"The Longing to Rise\\")    This is an engrossing and rich portrait of the characters, their lives and motivations, their dreams and ambitions, all put into a detailed history of the times in which they lived, that goes far beyond the standard textbook history that we have all been subjected to in school.  I can almost guarantee that, even if you don't particularly like history, this book will engage and keep you interested (if not fascinated) in both the people involved, as well as give you a fresh view of early American history.
0061964948|4.0|It's a limited edition, a collector's object and it is truly beautiful. However, it creaks when opened and I get the feeling that the back of the book can't take that much. Other than that I love it and it has a special place in my shelf. For photos and close-ups from inside the book, see this set on Flickr:     [...]
0061537969|3.0|My sister sent me this and she loved it as well as several other friends. So, I was anxious to read it. Found it compelling for the first 50 pages, so so after that and absolutely tedious for the last third. It's a \\"one-joke\\" book. Dog lovers may be enchanted, just because it's written from a dog's pov. I enjoyed that part, at the beginning, then found that it didn't offer much more. Does cover the sad story of a guy and his family and legal troubles by nasty in-laws. Insightful into all that, not so much. Good luck. I hope you like it more than I did.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I was very excited to get this product.  An avid media fan, be it games or movies, I wanted a high quality headset and this product was not only backed by a company I've done business with before, but also had a lot of good review backing.  And I have to say, first impressions with it were great.  I got it out of the box and put it on, very comfortable.  Cancels all but the loudest outside noises so all you hear is what the speakers put out.  And what the speakers put out is fantastic.  Excellent sound quality.  More, the set is very sturdy.  Adjusts and holds to how you want it without issue.    So if it sounds great and isn't broken, what's the issue?  Well, everything else.    First, the noise canceling microphone does not cancel noise.  It will pick up mouse clicks and other background noise nearly as well as any cheap $20 set.  This feature is broken out of the box.  Second, the microphone will constantly, unless you put on one of the outrageous funny voices packages with the software, emit a continuous buzzing noise which despite any and all attempted adjustments or tweaking will not go away.  This is unforgivable.  My five year old headset had a crystal clear mic with just as much (none) noise canceling ability.    So ok, maybe you can get by the buzzing.  It's not overly loud after all, just a minor annoyance when it's quiet or especially if the volume is turned way up.  You're thinking, ok, I can live with that.  It's comfortable and still produces good sound and it will last awhile.  Minor inconvenience to what sounds like an otherwise solid product.  And you'd be right.  If you're only planning on using the headset for about 10 minutes at a time.  That's right, 10 minutes.  I'm not talking about battery life, which lasts a good nine hours before needing to be recharged.  No, this headset likes to hibernate every few minutes to save battery power.  Now this wouldn't be such an issue except for the fact that there is absolutely no way to turn the feature off.  It also wouldn't be an issue if the set properly detected that it was currently in use.   But it doesn't.  And worse, the set has the fun like toward randomly desynchronizing from your computer.  So even if you don't hit that 10 minute mark it might cut out anyway just 'cause.  Watching a movie?  Prepare to pause and go back often.  Talking to a friend?  If they can stand the buzzing hopefully they can stand you cutting out mid sentence.  Doing a recording?  Good friggin' luck.    I wanted to like this product, desperately.  I've have played around with the settings, reinstalled numerous times, made sure all drivers were up to date, even got Logitech's beta driver for it hoping something would change.  No luck whatsoever.  The hardware here is fantastic and would be worth every penny if not for some of the poorest software I've ever had the displeasure of using.  This is a $160 headset with $.02 software to run it.  A true shame.  Two weeks I've battled with this product and tomorrow it's getting returned.  Do NOT buy.  It is in no way worth the money.
030745455X|1.0|I got through no more than a quarter of this book when I decided I had had enough!  I did want to know what the big mystery of the main character was about, but I just couldn't keep reading about such trashy relationships and lack of moral responsibility.  This seemed a personification of what I've heard about a permissive and liberal Swedish culture and society.  If this fictional story is anywhere close to how life is conducted in Sweden, good grief!  No wonder they have sex trafficking going on in such abundance.  Normally I donate the books I read to my hometown library, but definitely not this one.  I wouldn't want to knowingly make this piece of unmitigated crassness available to any more readers!
0312370849|3.0|A unique historical event provides the backdrop for this predictable story. The history of Paris' betayal of its Jewish population was the only thing worth reading in this tedious book. The protaganist was just too weak and weapy to make a good foil for the dramatic events of World War II.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Oh, I just love love this film. It's the best, I saw it many times already. I love all the fighting and cool visuals, music, and everything about it. It's super funny and wicked. Great plot and great cast. Scott Pilgram has to defeat the 7 evil ex's of his new girfriend who has different colored hair, like me,though i was dying my hair way before she did... anyway I had no idea what this film was about first off. When i saw the poster, i thought it would be some dumb film about a guy wanting to be a good guitarist, but the trailer told me otherwise. I saw the film with a friend and we both enjoyed it. It's a fantastic everything, yay!! Go see it!
B003J27WFW|5.0|Fantastic documentary! A must for any Rush fan of course - and a great introduction to the band for everyone else.
B004529NKC|5.0|This is a very well done movie I say its best of the three but i like one second, the step up 2 was a flop. The choreagraphy was amazing!!!!!!!!! My daughter absolutly loved it as well. She wants to be a professional dancer she took every type of dance. Step up 3-d is a enjoyable experience!
0061020710|5.0|It had been a while since I read a really good book.  I purchased this novel on a whim and Im so glad I did.  This book was awesome. I can't wait to read the whole series!
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|reminiscent of Mel Brooks at his best, this is probably one of the funnies movies I have ever seen.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Riordan has created a wonderful book without spoiling the first part of the series. A son of Zues, a son of Hephastus, and a daughter of Aphrodite set out on a quest to save the queen of gods, Hera. The book is a amazing story based on Rachel's Great Prophecy. Please, all of you Percy Jackson fans, READ THIS BOOK! You will love it!
B0012OGCO6|4.0|I always love a movie about good vs. evil. Especially when Andy Whitfield is the good.  I thought Gabriel moved a bit slow.  For such a low budget film you would think they would have speeded up the plot a bit.      However, for such a low budget film, I think they put a really good body of work out in this film. It kind of reminded me of sin city.  I enjoyed the fight scenes.  Wish there were more of them. I imagine it looses some of it's effect on a 19 inch computer screen.  Would have loved to have seen this in a theater.  Would love to see it brought to the states and put on big screen.
031603438X|5.0|I can't stop reading.  Two days now and I can't put it down.     I feel like I'm along with Keith in those wonderful stories of his childhood and all the events that absolutely   made him who he is.  Lots of new stuff.....about his bandmates and other groups.  And it's so about the music.    Thanks Keith.  Maybe the best book I've read in years.
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|I am a big, big, BIG fan of the show and was thrilled when the first movie came out. I was even more thrilled when I heard the 2nd movie was coming out...until I saw it. When I saw the first movie, I watched it over and over again, but this 2nd movie, once is enough.     The first thing that annoyed me most was the amount of \\"Tammy Faye\\" makeup they put on the ladies. They are all beautiful women, but the excessive amount of makeup they had caked on them made them look so old and was not flattering at all.     The second thing that annoyed me was the incident that Samantha had where she was \\"being attacked\\" by all the men while she was having a hormonal episode. It just was in poor taste and bothered me.     It was nice to see that \\"my girls\\" were progressing brilliantly with their lives, but I really would have of enjoyed it much better if it ended with Carrie discovering she was pregnant...then I think the book could be closed on the lives of these 4 women whom I've gotten to know over the past 12 years or so.
0765326353|4.0|First of all, let me make something very clear. There is nothing ground breaking about the Way of Kings. It has got the standard High/epic fantasy characters. The naturally gifted young man who always felt like an outsider finds hidden powers, a girl takes great risks to save her family and a General who only wants to protect a Foolish king from himself. Now that we have got that out of the way, the execution is flawless. Sanderson has got the setup and the background just right. He doesn't go on to so much detail that those who are interested in the human conflict are bored ,while at the same time there is enough background on politics, Magic systems and Culture for those who are interested in the actual World building. Importantly, there is not a dull moment with no \\"arms being folded under Breasts\\" or \\"skirts being smoothened\\" and the shifts in the POV keep the story moving at a breakneck pace. He ties up most of the plots by the end of the book and does a competent job of clearly and sympathetically painting the characters' inner conflicts. Because it does not stray too much from the High/ Epic Fantasy template, you can almost tell exactly what is going to happen next. So, it really boils down to this- Was this book good enough that I would read book two? Yes. Is it good enough that I will read this book again? Probably not.
B003ZJ70W4|3.0|I like this show, but the movies has been completely disappointing.   It is ok, I like the beginning, specially because I always like Samantha with Jerry Jerrod/Smith Jerrod, so seen them together was nice. But it was really clearly that they are not 30 or something anymore, so having to see this successful woman behave like crazy teens.. ahh.. I just wasn't ready for that. I always like how they were friends, and supportive of each other. After the last episode of Sex & the city, I just couldn't understand why Carrie so successful and brilliant just couldn't fit in Paris.. and why Samantha with all her sex driven just couldn't get satisfy or at least be wise enough to know that love was knocking her door and she was ready for it. The true is that you never go back to Big.. he has his time, he lose it. So yes I give it try to this movie, I enjoy the beginning, it was nice to see them together, but eventually I got tire of their behavior. They have it all, but can't get enough of it?! So they got what they wanted but none of them seems to be happy... I can't see  Charlotte crying anymore, she was cute before, now she frowns her face really creepy.
B001QD7SF0|1.0|I love Bruce and I know he could write music in his sleep.  Well he did and it's not very good.
B00428CPUY|3.0|First of all, I wasn't there and mine is the regular DVD version. This is a real guitar aficionado's DVD. Unfortunately, that's not what I am. I'm a music fan of the Eric Clapton generation. Disc one was kind of a waste of time for me. I didn't know most of the people and never heard of most of the songs. I watched ZZ Top and really liked Vince Gill but that was it. The second disc was much better. Jeff Beck was awesome as usual. You never know what he will come up with but it's always worth listening to. I love Steve Winwood but why sing \\"Had to Cry Today\\" and \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\" again when it's on last year's Crossroad?. He's got lots of hits. Sing something else. The same with Eric singing \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\" again, come on. However, his and Eric's version of Voodoo Chile is amazing. They slowed it down and made it bluesy. It was worth the wait. I was kind of disappointed that Eric didn't play a George Harrison song again as a tribute. I thought he was going to do that every year - \\"Wah-Wah\\" would have been nice.    As a totally different aside.  Eric is beginning to resemble an old man who hangs around playgrounds looking for little girls. He needs to shave and get a damn hair cut. It's scary.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|It's frustrating how bad \\"Hereafter\\" is. The topic, life after death, is fascinating. Almost all the actors are top notch in every scene. Cecile de France and Thierry Neuvic are both especially good, both gorgeous and moving in their roles. Clint Eastwood's direction exemplifies seamless, slick, pro, Hollywood style. The problem is the script. It's idiotic, manipulative, and shallow. Worst of all, its emptiness and ineptitude often produces sheer boredom. You will learn more about death watching a cable TV afternoon show on professional psychics, or having a long talk with a friend about paranormal phenomena, or reading online accounts of near death encounters. When a movie can't get any deeper than these readily available alternatives, it truly is wasting your money and your time.<br /><br />There are a couple of really great scenes in \\"Hereafter.\\" The best scene is the very first one; maybe you can check into a theater showing the film just to catch it. The opening scene depicts a couple of gorgeous French tourists, Marie and Didier (Cecile de France and Thierry Neuvic) lounging in their hotel bedroom in Southeast Asia. Marie remembers that they must purchase presents for his kids. She ventures to a market; he stays in bed. And the 2004 Tsunami hits. The special effects here are one hundred percent convincing - it's as if you are viewing actual film footage of the tsunami rising from the ocean and flooding the beach, hotels, the streetside markets where Marie shops. Utility poles snap and fall, one after the other, like so many twigs. Cars are taken up and become waterborne projectiles, mercilessly hitting and drowning humans. Marie is shown, bruised and battered, falling through water, detritus, past other bodies. What's so remarkable about this scene is that it emphasizes the human tragedy of the tsunami, rather than the ooo-aaa of watching a virtuoso special effects scene.<br /><br />But there are too many other scenes that are completely shallow, silly, and manipulative. A character is introduced, built-up, and killed off in record time. Even as this character makes his appearance, and is shown, with brisk efficiency, to be someone you could love, you realize that this character has no place in the plot, no place in the movie, except as someone the movie is teaching you to like so he can be killed off and used to serve the film's theme of life after death. You get it that the film is doing nothing in this character's scenes but milking your tears. The movie really lost me with these scenes, and those who have seen the movie know exactly which character I'm talking about.<br /><br />Another character is introduced only to make the situation of retired psychic George Lonegan (Matt Damon) more pathetic. As soon as this character appears onscreen, you know exactly why she's there, how and why she will let George down, and so you can't become emotionally involved in any scene she's in.<br /><br />Damon is never believable as George the psychic. George is written as a completely passive, socially retarded loser who doesn't know how to say \\"No\\" or how to make a living. Damon is most convincing as a cocky character. Again and again George attempts, and fails, to say \\"No\\" to people, and Damon can't make these scenes believable or poignant or make them make any sense at all. In their repetitiveness, they become frustrating, and ultimately laughable. In addition to being a passive pushover, George isn't very nice. He's shown behaving very badly toward a child and any sympathy the audience might have had for him is lost.<br /><br />Even the lighting is handled manipulatively. When George is in apartments with several available lamps, he lights only the lamps in adjacent rooms, and conducts his psychic readings half in darkness. No reason is giving for this, except that we all know that darkness is more spooky.<br /><br />There's a completely unbelievable scene where a small child visits several psychics in London in one day. I knowadults who couldn't handle the logistics of such a field trip: tracking psychics down, locating and traveling to one venue after another, paying admission fees, reserving seats ... and a small child does this? Not. Took me right out of the movie.<br /><br />The ending of this movie is awkward and completely unbelievable and utterly absent any emotional truth. It seemed an attempt by the screenwriter to put a big, fat bow on the empty mess that preceded it.<br /><br />Two relatively minor complaints: most of the film follows three completely disconnected storylines in three different countries, and there is no good reason for this. All three storylines could have easily taken place in one country, and the viewer would be spared the annoyance of having to read subtitles. When actors as good looking as de France and Neuvic are onscreen, you don't want to miss a shot. There are a few blatantly anti-Christian scenes that are just laughable in their absurdity. There is a Christian conspiracy to keep knowledge of the afterlife publicly known? Christians are preventing scientists from researching this topic? Yeah, sure, if you think throwing that into your movie will sell tickets or add depth. Good luck with that.f such a field trip: tracking psychics down, locating and traveling to one venue after another, paying admission fees, reserving seats ... and a small child does this? Not.

B002ZG9800|4.0|This film is based on a book, which - in turn - is based on the real life exploits of Steven Russell, an embezzler, con artist and hopeless romantic, who repeatedly managed to get out of prison through devious means.  Steven starts off as a devout church-going family man, working as a cop as he tries to track down his birth mother. He and his family then move to Texas, where he starts work for a produce company, and simultaneously starts to explore his same-sex attractions, which he had been repressing for the most part.  After a brush with death, Steven decides to come clean about his sexual orientation to his wife, and moves to Florida to live with a boyfriend.  Problem: Being an \\"a-list\\" gay in Miami is expensive, and Steven sees insurance fraud as the means to that end. He gets caught and sent to prison, where he meets Phillip Morris, and instantly falls in love. Already an expert at \\"working the system\\" behind the prison walls, Steven manages to get assigned to share Philip's cell, and, when he gets released, returns posing as Phillip's attorney to get him sprung as well.  The couple live an ideally life ... for a while, until Steven's compulsions again (and again) leave them running from the law.<br /><br />As Steven, Jim Carey provides an interesting combination of surprising empathy and sensitivity, combined with his trademark over-the-top comic persona, which is still a little grating in places. Evan McGregor is wasted in the role of Phillip, which he plays with an simple wide-eyed naivety that fits the part. Other than some self-loathing anti-gay comments Steven makes while dealing with his sexuality, and a few bits with outlandish outfits, the film stays remarkably away from stereotypical depictions, and the few outsiders who know their relationship seem to accept it as no big deal.<br /><br />That said, this is a tough film to rate.  Unlike the book, which I am told had a serious tone throughout, the film tries to be part documentary / \\"true crime\\" drama, and part light romantic comedy. It is that battle between madcap comedy and serious drama that makes this film tough to get into, which I believe is its main failing, which I chalk up to the direction.  The acting is good (not great), and it's worth a look.  I give it four stars out of five.ght romantic comedy.

B003PPDBE4|1.0|Be aware of this version. Just like those ones on the Internet its a short version very bad translated from the original. It misses entire pages on some chapters. Its really sad that an historical book like this is sold in Amazon not on its original version letter by letter. It has words replaced which change the meaning completely of some phrases and you can clearly see its like 100 hundred pages shorter then other versions.
0586045449|5.0|I concur with John Stedman's earlier review praising Deighton's work. This is a well-research fictional documentary that brought me the closest I've every felt to \\"being there\\" during an aviation campaign in WW II. And his detailed descriptions not only enhance the reality of events, but taught me many technical details about that warfare and the numerous civilians and military non-fliers who were impacted by it on the ground.
B0043GAZYS|2.0|UPDATE - 2/23/2017<br />So, I decided to update this review after watching this again recently. When I first saw Scott Pilgrim in theaters I was in my early twenties, or tweens as some folks call them now. Now I'm almost 30 with a job, a house, a wife, and pets. I don't know if it's just that I didn't notice a bunch of things that I notice nowadays, or just didn't care.<br /><br />One thing I noticed on my most recent viewing was that all the characters (with the exception of one) are exceptionally awful people. These are not folks I would want to surround myself with and call friends. The protagonist, especially, is an arrogant, self-centered, clueless, asenine, unfaithful, talentless, whining jerk. A whining jerk who cheats on his girlfriend, who still tries to be faithful to him despite the betrayal, and he goes off to chase Ramona; Some flighty weird bimbo with commitment issues and a slew of ex-lovers (each representing the 7 deadly sins) who will do anything to ruin her relationship happiness. Anyone else think that's dumb? I do.<br /><br />I don't mean to rain on your parade, but the only people that value this movie are weak-kneed and sad little tweeny hipsters. The movie is dumb. Incomprehensibly dumb.<br /><br />While it may appeal to you in your tweens, when acually do some growing up and have to actually be a responsible adult, the film falls flat and loses all meaning.<br /><br />---Old review from years ago ---<br /><br />So, when I heard that &#34;Scott Pilgrim&#34; was being made into an actual movie, I gave it a shrug of interest...then I found out it was being directed by Edgar Wright (&#34;Hot Fuzz&#34;, &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34;) and I knew I needed to see it. I'm glad I did. The film (this is a no spoiler review) is top notch for Wright and really bends his usual comedic style into a new and more appealing vein. Few to nobody has done any films that focus the movie onto videogame references and put such perspective light onto the characters. For someone like Scott he probably contextualizes life through videogames and that translates into the film with full on kung-fu battles, points, power ups, extra lives, and super-powers. This makes for a more visual and engrossing movie. The plot is solid and the characters are excellent, right down to the supporting cast. The audience isn't forced to like Scott and even seems to give you the option to make up your own mind about him. He's the kind of fallible protagonist that a lot of movies just don't seem to have these days. I could go into far more detail and plot information but that would only violate my strict (&#34;No Spoiler&#34;) policy on reviews.<br /><br />My only grievance is that the film overuses gay jokes until they stop being funny and only turn out more annoying. Some folks, I suspect, will have some issue with their being in the movie at all. Though, for me, while it was a constant annoyance it didn't spoil the overall experience of the film. Yes, the movie is that good.<br /><br />The &#34;Level Up: Collectors Edition&#34; is the best buy you can get for the money. The Blu-Ray, DVD, and digital copy set-up is quite the idea for you value shoppers this holiday season. You'll be sure to get the right kind of format for the right price. The special features are a bit higher quality than I would have expected so that's always a plus.<br /><br />My rating: Awesome<br />Don't rent, BUY this movie.

My only grievance is that the film overuses gay jokes until they stop being funny and only turn out more annoying. Some folks, I suspect, will have some issue with their being in the movie at all. Though, for me, while it was a constant annoyance it didn't spoil the overall experience of the film. Yes, the movie is that good.  The &#34;Level Up: Collectors Edition&#34; is the best buy you can get for the money. The Blu-Ray, DVD, and digital copy set-up is quite the idea for you value shoppers this holiday season. You'll be sure to get the right kind of format for the right price. The special features are a bit higher quality than I would have expected so that's always a plus.  My rating: Awesome Don't rent, BUY this movie. You'll love it.

B0019NG7BS|5.0|Sergio Leone created the 5 greatest westerns of all time. This one is tied for first place with 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. I won't review this movie, if you have seen any Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, you'll know what to expect.    Sergio Leone made 3 other westerns which deserve as much attention as this movie and 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' which starred Henry Fonda. Two of those were the other great Clint Eastwood westerns, 'Fistful of Dollars' and 'For a Few Dollars More'.     The third also stars Henry Fonda and it's every bit as good as the others. It is 'My Name is Nobody'. This movie is as serious as the others but Italian co-star Terrence Hill adds humor throughout his great performance as his version of 'the man with no name', a gunslinger as fast as Eastwood and Bronson.    Bottom line, if you loved any of the Clint Eastwood westerns, you will love the other 4 of these that Sergio Leone created, the greatest 5 westerns of all time.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|The first time i heard this great heavy metal album i was amazed by the guitar work on this album.It is amazing but what do you say when you have dave mustaine as one of the best heavy metal rhythm guitarists and marty friedman on lead. Believe me these two are at their best on this album the whole album is great and to me the songs are very catchy.  The music sounds very technical and hard to play.  This album is a huge influece to me.
0345410025|5.0|I am an expert at memorizing and have written four books on the subject of memory training.    This is a very good book.    Not only does it improve every day memory skills but it also gives you the tools required to do memory demonstrations for your friends. Trust me, they will be impressed when you memorize an entire deck of cards in minutes.    If you have never done any memory training, you will be amazed by the power of the techniques.

B00275EHJG|5.0|All Things Must Change. That seems to be the main message to the third & final Toy Story movie. As fans have waited eleven years for the next sequel, the sequel itself has noted the passage of time...Andy is now a young man & ready to go off to college. His toys--whom he has outgrown--are despondent that Andy no longer plays with them. So it's up to the attic as storage for the toys; except a terrible mistake sends the gang to a pre-school called Sunnyside. Thinking the place is a new life for them, they soon learn they've been duped: The place is a prison, a living nightmare as they are caged at night & put at the mercy of ruthless toddlers during the day. This is where the storyline becomes surprisingly dark as Woody returns to rescue his friends & hatch sort of a \\"Mission Impossible\\": Get everyone past security, \\"all-seeing monkeys\\", and all kinds of obstacles so they can be reunited with their owner.   Disney-Pixar just never ceases to amaze me. The first two films were oh-so-imaginative & clever--with the trademark Disney \\"heart\\"--but this one pulls out all the stops. It's full of thrilling, almost suspenseful twists & turns, humor & powerfully emotional moments. And what can I say about the animation that hasn't been said? It's simply wonderful. The voice talent, as usual, is superb. Veteran actor Ned Beatty turns in a good performance as Lotso, the bear that's cuddly & sweet-smelling on the outside, but hides a dark heart of cruel villainy inside. Michael Keaton also has some wonderfully hammy moments as Ken.   There's the usual satiric toy humor here, but what will probably get to you are the heart-wrenching moments. Namely, when the gang finds themselves hopelessly staring death in the face, and touchingly holding hands as the end draws near; and the finale, as Andy donates his toys to a sweet little girl down the street, allowing himself one last play with his \\"old pals\\" before heading to college. It's a fitting ending to a charming trilogy.  Highly recommended!
B003NX6ZDC|4.0|Have to say, I really enjoyed this CD.  There are 5 solid tracks and \\"Crossfire\\" is so instantly digable that it could be the song of the year.  What Brandon seems to capture here is that late 80's Canadian/Brit folk pop sound (perhaps the Daniel Lanois productions add to that)--I liken it Tom Cochrane and Red Rider or (as someone else suggested) Chris DeBurgh.  For me, it's just good music.  Not every song is perfect, but \\"Only The Young\\", \\"Jacksonville\\", \\"Crossfire\\", \\"Magdalena\\", and \\"Hard Enough\\" are VERY GOOD.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|I thought this was well written and beautifully acted especially by Winslet. I thought the very best love story was the friendship that develops between a young woman and an older neighbor. That was unexpected and classic. Love this movie!
B002VKE1K2|5.0|This movie was scary, although it wasnt as scary as some critics say. But it was such a good movie and I cant wait to see the 2nd one.
0553805371|4.0|I was a little leery about trying this book because I'm not a physics major and don't have a doctorate, so would I be able to follow what was said? Instead, Hawking does a great job of explaining his theories and ideas in a simple way that most people will follow easily. While I can't agree with everything he brings out as absolute truth, I have to give him credit for writing a very entertaining book that should appeal to a lot of folks.

B002TQ3OBU|5.0|Great perfect don't even think about buying this album before pressing the buttons just get it you will not regret it. Same for their other albums from this seller. Think Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd, but not a replica, just a lot of similarities. It has a fresh new feeling no other progressive artists have ever brought before, while reminding us of Pink Floyd at the same time. The song The Sky Moves Sideways is divided into two parts much like Shine On You Crazy Diamond, but it is even more spacey, and an even fuller feeling to the atmosphere created. Steven Wilson's genius shines through using flute's, and his guitar to create some of the most beautiful music ever. Dislocated Day, is actually quite heavy, and if anybody is a Rainbow fan they may recognize that the riff sounds extremely similar to Gates of Babylon, but it is still a great song nonetheless. Highly Recommended especially if you are a fan of Pink Floyd, experimental, 1970's progressive rock, or classic rock in general you should love this.
B00005JLD4|4.0|In this courageous story, a 14 year old girl named Molly perseveres through nearly unthinkable hardships as she is literally ripped from her mother's arms and moved 1,200 miles away to an indoctrination center masquerading as a school.  Along with her eight year old sister and ten year old cousin they break free of the cages, both figurative and literal, to embark on an arduous journey back to family, back to home.  Because of a eugenics based government policy in Australia, all half-caste Aboriginal children were to be taken from their parents and sent to schools.  For nearly 70 years this policy attempted to educated and breed out the blackness of half-castes.<br /><br />Based on a book written by the actual daughter of Molly, this film is primarily about the three month struggle endured by the trio of little girls as they followed a rabbit-proof fence home through the sometimes very unforgiving outback landscape.  Along the way they bond, survive, and avoid the various efforts of the \\"Chief Protector of the Aborigines,\\" A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branaugh), and the tracker who is always one step behind the ingenious little girls.<br /><br />All of the leads were wonderfully real, and had the filming been done differently I could have been convinced that this was a documentary instead of a film.  Those playing Aborigine roles displayed a wide range of emotions, and truly appeared affected by all that transpired.  Branaugh, on the other hand, acted with the quiet reserve of a man who is powerful without being overbearing, a man who believes in the misguided policies of previous generations.  The pacing and directing is purposeful; it's slow, deliberate, and effective.  At no time does tedium become an issue, despite the lack of action.  Attention is demanded by the story's power and historical relevancy.<br /><br />This story and movie would be a wonderful supplement to any history teacher's curriculum, and it should be mandatory viewing for Australian students.  If I had to compare the power of this movie, my immediate thoughts are of [[ASIN:0790740850 The Power of One]].  For a movie with a clearly limited budget and a very basic, albeit beautiful presentation of the Australian countryside, I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />Jason Elinof this movie, my immediate thoughts are of [[ASIN:0790740850 The Power of One]].

B003WKOLQO|4.0|This band is a breath of fresh air. I saw them open for Metallica last year at Madison Square Garden and they seemed OK, but didn't really pay much mind to them.     It wasn't until recently, that I heard their new single on the local college radio station and upon talking to a friend who told me their albums were awesome that I decided to try out one of their albums.    There's not much to say here that differs from the other reviews - this is a highly original, talented band that not only can play heavy, but have an amazing sense of melody and tunefulness.  There are no growling vocals that destroy most other metal bands (except for the Barney Greenway song, which is still good anyway), and unlike most other newer bands, Volbeat does not wear their influcences on their sleeve in an obvious way.    My ONLY COMPLAINT - and hence, my 4 star instead of 5 star rating - is that, after about 10 songs, the vocal style of the singer tends to get repetitive. His voice also bears a striking resemblance to Keith Caputo of Life of Agony as well as the singer of the now-defunct band Kilgore (Smudge).  Has anyone else noticed that????    I see Volbeat a few other albums besides this new one, so I plan on checking them out. This is definitely a band to watch.
B0000033WC|5.0|I've been a lover of their first album with Nico for ages (since hearing \\"herion\\" on the Doors movie). I was definitely a bit trepidatious at first, as it's a 1970 album and felt the creative juices were probably wearing thin....  How wrong! This is absolutely an amazing album straight away with the melodic opening track, then straight in to the rockin' and euphoric \\"Sweet Jane\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\".What a one-two knock-out! From there on in is a solid album, kinda eclectic and slightly countrified (if that's a word). I have to say the last track \\"Oh! Sweet Nuthin'\\" is a soulful ballad of introspection that is prevented from languishing by this gorgeous melody that immerses you.   There's some amazing bonus tracks on disc one, the stand-out is \\"I'm Sticking With You\\" which sounds like the female drummer singing this infectious, simple, curious and bouncy sing-along. Disc 2 I personally found for die-hard fans only.  A great album for VU fans and novices alike. 8.5/10
0553805371|4.0|If you love reading about cosmology, fundamental physics and the like you'll enjoy it. The ideas in this book aren't new (Hawking's previous books already contained them) but they are explained in such an appealing and understandable way. What i think is really new is the idea that our universe can be explained without resorting to the notion of God, which is ultimately the purpose of the book.
0811876373|5.0|I absolutely adore this book and Bakerella!!  Just looking at this book is fun!!!  Super great gift for a baker or a kid who likes to bake!!!
B0001I561E|1.0|I was seriously disturbed by this film. Who ever wrote this must have been a deeply deranged individual with a really sick mind because some of the scenes in this movie are just down right despicable and gross.
B000001EAQ|5.0|When I was in high school, I lived on U2.  At the time, my favorite albums were War and The Joshua Tree.  Pop was released my freshman year, and I just didn't understand it.  I listened to it once in a while, but generally passed it up for other U2 recordings.  There was even a time when I listened to \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" on purpose.  Yuk!      Recently, however, I discovered this album, and after nearly a decade of not listening to any U2 to speak of, it has earned my respect, while the latter albums lost my respect.  U2 rose to stardom because they were always pushing themselves.  They found distinctive sounds in each of their great albums - War, The Joshua Tree, Zooropa, Achtung Baby, all have very different sounds.  This constant reinvention culminated in Pop, which must have been too much of a departure for mainstream pop/rock radio.  As a result, this album's title foreshadows what the band would become - a generic bubble gum pop band.      But Pop is a masterpiece!  The music, the lyrics, and the way it flows from one song to the next.  It's deep, emotional, soulful rock.  Sure, there's some electronics, but so what?  The sound is far from techno, despite what other reviewers suggest.  It's the such a passionate album.  It is this soul, this passion, and this depth that makes it quintessentially U2.  And the lack of these traits is what make their more recent albums ... well, not U2.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I ordered my CD/DVD  combo on a Thursday and as promised I had it in my mail box on Tuesday. The DVD is great and I love the CD that came in it as well. This is a great price and a great company to purchase through. I would recommend any and all to purchase this DVD/CD Combo thru Amazon. All good things to say about this purchase.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|I'm a recently self-discovered addict of Gorillaz music, so one day I sat down and ordered all three studio albums, including Plastic Beach, and their D-Sides collection as well.  I'll admit, when I received Plastic Beach in the mail, I opened it up and was disappointed to see a very normal CD case (made of paper or cardboard) with a simple sleeve for the CD.  Part of the luster I guess of buying a new album is the case and the artwork inside.  But we'll come back to this later.    Plastic Beach is PHENOMENAL.  Gorillaz have a penchant for incorporating distinct new styles and themes into their work and collaborating with a lot of people, but Plastic Beach is Gorillaz collaboration on steroids.  It's a must-have for any fan of the band.  The style in this concept album is distinctly more mellow and harmonic than the previous two studio albums.  If you're not a fan of synth-pop or electronic drum machines and similar styles, then this isn't for you, but if you're a fan of Gorillaz, you'll appreciate the incorporation the creators made into the storyline by not inviting the band's drummer, Russell, to the studio on Plastic Beach.  Gorillaz fans should check out the video idents, music videos for Stylo and On Melancholy Hill and the storyboard for Rhinestone Eyes to further enhance their enjoyment of the album.    I certainly don't mind the shift to a more electronic, synthetic sound, and this is NOT just an electronica compilation for anyone who's hesitant to check it out.  Just listen to track #2 as Snoop Dogg welcomes you into the world of the Plastic Beach with a very smooth albeit pumping-up contribution. The soulful singing of Bobby Womack in Stylo is the perfect accompaniment to a contribution by Mos Def and the beats laid down in Stylo (Bruce Willis pulls a cameo in the video, check it out).  Superfast Jellyfish brings back De La Soul in a pretty upbeat track, and it's immediately followed by one of my favorite tracks on the album, the relaxing Empire Ants, which highlights the vocals of Damon Albarn and the contributing Little Dragon.  My favorite tracks right now are Rhinestone Eyes, a synth-based song with a fast-paced but sad melody, and On Melancholy Hill, a more relaxed track.  Even songs like Glitter Freeze, Some Kind of Nature and Pirate Jet have enthralling beats that complement the rest of the album.    The inherent theme of Plastic Beach, the lyrics, the videos and the concert itself involves the nature of Plastic Beach being a collection of all the world's pollution at one point in the middle of the ocean (you'll hear plastic references throughout the album).  So I don't mind so much having a very simple CD case to store this great collaborative work, which I thoroughly enjoy.
0812973992|5.0|I loved this book.  I loved the development of the individual characters and the way the author wove their stories together to make the whole.  The ordinary people of the book had a lot more to their lives than appearances would have it.  the writing is first quality in my opinion and I look forward to reading his other books.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|Let me start off by saying I love Christmas movies, almost all of them.  So I went to the theatre with high hopes but was quickly let down.  Being Disney and having Jim Carey I was expecting an updated story with some comical twists and some laughs, but there were none.  To be honest, it was boring.  The 3-D was alright, but overall the movie was a big miss.    I'll stick with the Muppet's and Mickey's versions of A Christmas Carol.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|I was somebody who listened when California Waiting was the introduction to the \\"Southern Strokes\\". Yeah, you want to misunderstand Caleb's lyrics like old times. This is a studio polished album, maybe number #3 favorite of KOLs. People tend to HATE when you hear a song over and over. I think this album holds up pretty well with the other 4 albums. GIVE IT A CHANCE, remember we will hear this about 20 years from now on classic rock stations.
1439163146|1.0|Like the other viewers above, I can sum up my review with one word, \\"disappointment.\\"    I spent a few hours browsing a local book outlet over the weekend, and picked up James Franco's \\"Palo Alto Stories\\" with the hopes that his notable acting skills and the enormous undergraduate and graduate courses he has been taking in creative writing etc... would enhance even further his multi-talented career.    I was skeptical at first, given his lack of any extensive previous published writing (sadly for me, I had not seen his short works in some of the NY literary magazines -- which might have warned me off spending the money I laid out for this book).    I have to confess - I could not read the book until the end. (I rarely put a book down before finishing it, no matter how much I dislike it; I respect the effort of an author enough to plow through until the end, and then toss it. Sadly, this is only the 2nd or 3rd book in a life of reading spanning a half-century that I absolutely could not continue reading).I found the style, the prose just too awkward to read - not a style I liked at all. The book (what I read of it) needed some serious editing, and as other revewers said, I did not find sufficient character development.    On a positive side, I would say that the author does understand in subtle ways some of the characters presented (as he is only a decade or so \\"older\\" than the group he wrkites about; and I fear that perhaps those of us older by a few years (or decades) will find the prose style stilted, and yet for people of the age of the characters, the prose style is close to the way many speak - a sad commentary on the dying of the English language.    My disappointment is compunded knowing how talented Mr. Franco is as an actor. I would not discourage his writing, but I would hope before he does this again, there be some very serious critique before going to print.
B00405DUYO|1.0|As a true fan of Carrey's old movies I think I have the rigt to honestly say what I think about this one:    The Good:    1.  Good Story.    The Bad:    1.  Jim Carrey looks like he's at least 65 yrs old in this one.  WHY?!  2.  Where is Ewan McGregor's character supposed to be from?  He has four or more different accents!  3.  The kissing scenes were awful.  I felt bad for Ewan.    I think Jim Carrey should retire.  Sadly it would be too late to do it with dignity.    Good Luck, Jim!
1401923119|5.0|While I am not familiar with all the scientific data provided in the first part of the book, the second part is incredibly affirming of the mind-body connection and the credibility of various alternative and energy work.  I have ordered another copy to give to a family member and have told many others about this book.  Will review it for a women's discussion group.  It will change your perspective!
0143118420|4.0|My mother read this book before I did and I made plenty fun of her: \\"What the hell is this cheesy cornball crap you're reading?! Is it more like Eat, Pray, Hurl?\\". Of course now I'm eating my words. I was bored one day and picked it up, started reading it in a very half assed manner, but was quickly reeled in by the author's very honest and fun prose. I enjoyed the book immensely, plowing through it like an out of control tractor. Entertaining, fun, and even life changing.
B003WTE886|5.0|Absolutely amazing album! I love every single song on the cd and would highly recommend any fan of Taylor Swift to get the full album rather than a track at a time. A good range of songs that'll make you want to sing along, give you chills, and even a few tears.
1400049628|5.0|I'm so glad to recieved this. It took a little longer than the shipping said it would, but I believe that was the mail peoples fault.

B001DTPZNY|2.0|Nostalgia keeps us longing for more Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies, but the thing is - our expectations have not changed, but the people that make the movies have.  George Lucas filmed the Star Wars prequels, but failed to deliver in many regards with what made the classic trilogy so good.  The only truly good Indiana Jones movie was \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\"; \\"Temple of Doom\\" was average at best, and \\"The Last Crusade\\" had its moments.  There was talk for many years about a fourth Indiana Jones movie; Steven Spielberg and George Lucas waited too long to finally go through with it.  Harrison Ford, one of the best action stars ever, got old.  As a result he looks ridiculous wearing the same outfit in 1957 that he wore in the 30's according to the movie timeline, and fighting and doing things that are physically not possible for someone his age.  Instead of Nazi's, Jones now fights Soviet agents led by Cate Blanchett who looks and acts the worst she has been in her career.   There is a silly confrontation in a warehouse in Nevada followed by the much maligned nuclear testing scene in which Jones survives by stowing himself in a refrigerator and walks out unscathed after getting thrown out of the blast area.  Jones links up with Shia LaBeouf, with the unlikely name of \\"Mutt\\", who turns out to be the son he never knew he had.   After more silly hijinks they end up captured by the Soviets again.   Marion (Karen Allen) returns and it's a family reunion although they are in peril as prisoners; she's all smiles and out of place - just happy to be there (in real life and in the movie).  More silliness ensues with more fighting, army ants, Mutt swinging through trees with monkeys - this is what the tandem of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg has become.  A lot of people hated the fact that there are aliens at the end, however given the creators forged their fame and identity by creating movies with aliens, this is not a surprise.    The movie just does not work, and a typical Lucas-ism is that there is too much gratuitous humor that refers to the older movies.  Harrison Ford looks out of place in his old outfit and just looks old - trying to be something that he no longer is.  The movie is a failure for its silliness, awkward storyline, dialogue, and ill timing due to Ford's age.

B0044IJ1S6|3.0|I saw this tour last year, but have decided not to pick this DVD up, for a reason I'll get to shortly. I have all their other concert releases, generally enjoying (the 5.1 sound!) and not enjoying (the quick editing!) the various aspects of them. I figured this would be more of the same, and let's face it, their general setlist does not vary that much tour to tour. Then I came across something very interesting. Some guy in France has put together a complete DVD bootleg (for free download) of the Paris show from six different camera sources, but unlike most bootlegs, the sound is INCREDIBLE!! Either it was a radio broadcast or a soundboard recording, but the whole thing is excellent. A nice departure from the slick quality of all the other Corbijn projects. If you want to linger on the band for a long time during every song, this one is for you!! The audience cameras were generally up close to the band, and those are the shots you see the most, but again, as an alternative, this was a great discovery, and a job well-done by this Parisian fan - and, you can finally have Strangelove and Master and Servant!! I found it at [...] under the Depeche section. Sorry, Amazon (and Mute), but freedom of speech trumps every time!
0061120081|1.0|Buy it to cure your insomnia as it will certainly put you to sleep. It is one dead dull read. I fell for the media hype and borrowed a copy from someone...settled down with much anticipation only to find myself skipping pages in an attempt to be motivated enough to read it...after a few more pages I shelved it. Interestingly the person whom I borrowed it from has not found the will to read it either. people just like to appear educated and enlightened by claiming to like and understand certain books...this is one of them and a good party talking point...I will shock my audience by telling them it stunk!!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I have all of Josh Groban's Albums. My Wife and I are very big Groban fans and he's the reason I started singing, you can find my videos on youtube WVTenor86(sorry about saying that, its not the place). But, while listening to this CD, it sounds quite different from his other CD projects, NOT in a BAD way at all but a very good one. This certainly is \\"RAW\\" as a previous reviewer said. His recording sound different too. I love every song and I cant wait wait until his tour starts. But all of his pieces especially \\"Higher Window\\" and Bells of NYC\\" are my personal orchestral fav's. I will probably but 3 or 4 more of this CD as a present. I highly recomend it. All in all, I'd seriously say 5/5. Truly amazing work he did with this album!!!
B0041KKYBA|4.0|Just got home from the theater. Everyone over the age of 10 should see this film. I am old enough to remember when this all started with President Reagan. This documentary is a \\"call to action\\" for every thinking American. With the Corporate Personhood status these \\"so called\\" investment houses and banks enjoy, and the capacity to purchase any Congressperson they choose, we better wake up and follow the money. I will purchase a copy of this when it comes out and show it to everyone I know. This film connects the dots, sets the stage, and demands that as citizens we start asking the right questions and holding these people accountable. It's OUR money they are gambling with, and the consequences of their actions are going to be felt for generations.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in several years.  You get so involved that you will forget everything written is seen through a dog's eyes. I don't know how anyone could not like it. A really GREAT book.
B003Q6D27S|3.0|\\"Saw 3D,\\" the seventh installment of the popular horror franchise, is going to the last chapter of the series. When I saw \\"Saw V,\\" I thought \\"Saw VI\\" would be the final installment (with the secret about the box), but maybe the filmmakers just wanted more. Whatever the reason is, they made another \\"Saw,\\" which delivers what the long-running series have provided us with: deadly traps and gruesome deaths (and there's a lot of them).     But there is one thing that is missing: Jigsaw, who has very limited screen time here. Though Tobin Bell is first-billed, he is hardly in the film, about four minutes or less, which is very disappointing. The film's story revolves around Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and Jill (Betsy Russell), plus Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery), a survivor of Jigsaw's trap, who turned kind of celebrity. Hoffman lacks charisma of Tobin Bell's iconic character; Jill has little to do in the story; as to Bobby, well, you know exactly what will happen to him. Some characters return, only to confuse us more with its rushed ending.    It is reported that director Kevin Greutert, who did a much better job in \\"Saw VI,\\" was not originally attached to the project. He was called in on short notice, which might explain some of the plot holes and Jigsaw's near absence. Some of the fiendish traps (including the opening \\"table\\" trap) almost make up for it, though I believe Kevin Greutert could have done better with more time. Though it has moments, \\"Saw 3D\\" is a disappointing chapter of the saga.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|I may like this one more than Only By The Night, as it contains nothing as \\"bad\\" as Sex On Fire or Use Somebody. I put \\"bad\\" in quotations, because Caleb Followill's voice is so good and so distinctive, that he could sing a shopping list and render it compelling, or at least worth listening to. Therefore, even a weak or too commercial Kings of Leon song is rendered listenable and even catchy by virtue of their lead singer's voice.    The guitarist is good, but he owes a lot to the Edge and Andy Summers of the Police. I think he's better when he plays actual lines, rather than lean on effects pedals. Again, they have their moments music-wise, but this band's recent output becomes immediately boring without their frontman's voice. He is clearly their not-so-secret weapon. Musically, I like their early albums better but, that said, I can't seem to take Come Around Sundown out of my car CD player, and it's been there for over a week. So, if you like this band, I recommend this CD.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Fraulein Maria was the only mother I've ever known, and I've seen this film a zillion times, including in theaters in the 60's. The visuals are so stunning, so perfect, it's as if you're there watching them - not the actors, the characters. And the music is beautifully rendered - no surround sound remix artifacts, just beautifully rendered in stereo, better than you've ever heard it. I'm so impressed with this rendition. It's amazing they made a film with so much to say in the context of a musical of all things (and with child actors in tow). There really are no good/bad evil characters like we've come to expect. They managed to convey so many shades of gray & subtleties. After a lifetime of hating the Baroness, this viewing brought me to the realization that, after putting up a really good fight, she bowed out honorably. So many lessons about what's worth fighting for in this film.

0823015033|5.0|I will start by saying I actually see this as 4 1/2 stars.  But the two 1-star reviews unnecessarily drag the rating down so I chose to rate on the favorable side to help offset those two.  For any conspiracy theorists out there, give up on the government stuff and start focusing on sculpture books.  There so few good sculpture books out there that it has to be conspiracy.  I have found only a couple worth owning and this is the best in my collection.  It gives excellent instruction on proportions and locations.<br />The author's use and description of Basic Units and Modeling Units is brilliant (don't know if she created it or borrowed it, but who cares?  Its here and that's what counts).  Its devised in a way that allows you scale your projects up or down.  The base sculptures presented are 1:6 scale (6' model is 12\\" tall).  Using Base and Modeling Units, I successfully sculpted a baby to go with the adult by scaling to 1:24.  The book is loaded with diagrams showing legs, arms and torso in direct proportion to the size of the head (the first element in understanding human sculpture).<br />The book begins by showing how to hand-build the essential tools using readily available items and clay for the handles.  Whether by design or not, it gives the fledgling artist a starter in clay use without creating the intensity that may accompany the actual sculpting.  The author then uses these tools and refers to them by name each step at the beginning, then less so as it moves along.  This gives the artist the chance to experience most of the tools early, but lets them go with their natural extincts as it moves along.<br />Also of benefit in this book and the unit system is how the author breaks down the differences between men and women's bodies, and those of average vs. large (i.e. fat) bodies.  Her system of foil armatures is in some ways superior to wire armatures (the armature decision is based more in what the project is intended for though, as full wire armatures is not very practical for figurines like this).<br />The downside of the book (why I would actually give 4.5 instead of 5.0) is that a few of the photos are either from a poor angle or there is one photo where there should be two or three.  This is not only common in sculpture books, its almost epidemic.  But the number and quality of photos in this book outshines any other sculpting books I currently own.  The other negative of this book is the chapter on clothing.  I would call it almost helpful.  In the beginning of the chapter, it brilliantly shows how to attain texture in clay clothing.  But the clothing choices the author makes for the book is either simplistic or antique.  Great for those wishing to make characters from the past or fantasy realm, but I haven't a clue how to make T-shirt and blue jeans after studying the chapter.  I had to learn that on my own (although not always a bad thing).<br />I still highly recommend this book for fledgling clay artists, even if figurines are not your ultimate goal (mine is bronze sculptures).  I also recommend the author's other book, \\"Creating Life-Like Animals in Polymer Clay\\", though I would work through this book first.  It offers tools and clarity that the animal book lacks.  Together, they make an excellent pair for new artists.y practical for figurines like this).

1401309666|5.0|Today the media and entertainment industry are losing loyal audiences because of the different forms and options of media to choose from, such as the internet, iTunes, video games, niche television.  People are choosing what they like and finding different streams through such media.  So, what must businesses do to stay successful in selling products?  They must find a mass niche.  Find a space that does not cost them anything (i.e. Netflix, iTunes, Amazon.com and maximize their inventory for the best possible profit.  These businesses do not have to sell the best product, nor be the top seller in the industry selling in large volumes.  They can successfully sell their products on the internet, where they do not utilize shelf space or rent, and not be mainstream products.  This is what author, Chris Anderson, calls the \\"long tail\\".  Being in such a market gives small businesses the chance to sell products that do not hit the mainstream market, such as movies that do not hit the movie theaters or music that does not ever get played on the radio.  I find the concept of the long tail very interesting because it gives businesses the ability the opportunity to sell all products no matter how popular they are.  It gives them the chance to reach mainstream status.  Anderson's book was interesting to read and learn about how certain markets and products grow based on what people can find on the internet just from browsing website to website.  I find that this book was made for business, big or small, that are looking for different ways to market and sell on the internet no matter how mainstream the product is.
1439177783|5.0|Such a wonderfully written and candid book. As a previous surviver of anorexia, I know what Mrs. Portia DeGeneres explains as being so very valid. I also started at the age of 12 and it all started as a diet and then so easily snowballed into an eating disorder. I find it so refreshing that she explains how anorexia can be about this sense of accomplishment of self control. I felt that for so long. SO many dietician's and counselor's seemed to believe that it was about you viewing yourself as being overweight when you are not- Like looking in the mirror at 74 pounds and seeing a 150 pound woman but she explained it so well- you may view yourself as thin but your eyes go straight to the imperfections- the fat- nothing else matters. You do have blinders on. She is such a role model for so many women to look up to. I am thrilled that she came out with her story and courageous fight. A great read- it helps us all understand what a woman or man goes through with this disease. Ellen and Portia are such amazing role models- I know they are for myself as well as for my niece and we only know what we see and hear about through the media. This is the only book I have read from cover to cover in a week all year- I highly recommend it.
0439023521|5.0|I'm not the reader type. I listened to the Audiobook version. This book was recommended by a friend when I asked for a book to read in a flight. I rate it 5 stars because it was entertaining, unpredictable, funny on some parts, it has action, an imaginary(could be reality) world, and some romance. I couldn't stop listening starting from probably chapter 5 (I can't recall). The story even caused me to have teary eyes. I highly recommend this book.

When I popped the Blu Ray in my player, I was totally blown away by the vibrant colors and video quality. The images very clean,crisp and free from any DNR artifacts. The sound was equally amazing. Makes you feel like you're in a live broadway musical. I highly recommend this set to anyone who loves animation. My wife is really pleased with this set. Kudos to Amazon for the excellent customer service and packaging.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|Only the truth is more stunning than fiction. This film exposes one of the most shocking and inexcusable collusions to defraud the working stiff in all of history. We like to disdain the barbaric, grasping greed of bygone feudal lords but our own contemporaries - if not our own kind - have immeasurably surpassed their appetites for avarice.  Far from dry, Inside Job is a thriller. Only it's real. The global financial crisis of 2008, whose long tentacles still grip us today, was created by the same few whom it has enormously enriched and who will continue to be enormously powerful.
B003XRZZFM|5.0|I went back and listened to For All Tid quite a bit right before Abrahadabra came out. After a couple of listens to the new album, it occurred to me that this is the realization of what the band was struggling to express all the way back then. Except, instead of kids trying to do it on cheap keyboards and shoe-string production budgets, the band has grown to be able to command real orchestras and choruses and has the luxury of top-notch production.     Aside from production value, this album is remarkable for its vision and musical palate. The band's willingness to, at times, take a back seat to the orchestral arrangement creates a musical environment unlike any I've heard. Certainly far more accomplished than Therion at their best on Vovin. Speaking of Therion, though, is a great segue into my one complaint with the album. I might have taken off a half star for the guest vocalists. One of them sounds like he might be one of the vocalists from Therion -- the one who put me off of that band, in fact. It's either him or another guy with an equally weird, warbley, and annoying voice. Gak. I must admit, I do miss Vortex's clean vocal work here.     Otherwise, this album is sheer brilliance and highly recommended.
B003UERZ88|5.0|I really do not understand all the negative reviews for this CD. The more I listen to this the more and more I like it. Stand out tracks include \\"Speed of Sound\\" which displays some Maiden like guitar work and stellar vocals. The power of Halford's voice really shines here. \\"Hell Razor\\" could easily have been ripped from the Painkiller era. \\"Till the Day I Die\\" melts metal with southern rock complete with some slick slide guitar. Sure there are some melodic metal songs here but so what. Nothing wrong with showing some creativity in music. Everything song can't be \\"Painkiller\\" or \\"Freewheel Burning\\". Do yourself a favor and give this a chance. The more you listen the more you will appreciate just how great this CD is.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|(First of all, buy the boxed set, don't just download. The pictures and stories are priceless.)     This is NOT your \\"just another boxed set\\" collection. The songs are divided into sections for Barry, Robin, Maurice and Andy and the songs are were chosen by Barry, Robin, Yvonne Gibb (Maurice's wife)and Peta Gibb (Andy's daughter).     Many of these are \\"deep cuts\\" and there are a few unreleased gems in Maurice's and Andy's sections.    This is a set that the die-hard Bee Gees fan will adore and the casual Bee Gees fan will appreciate.    There are written tributes in the booklet, and Barry, Robin, Yvonne and Peta all contributed to the story. I read these with a lump in my throat, I have to say. Very poignant memories.      50 years of music; the soundtrack to our lives.    What an accomplishment. Happy Anniversary to the Bee Gees...    And thanks.

0316098337|3.0|\\"Room\\" is like a figure skating routine that is well-executed but that doesn't push the envelope - by using the Fritzl case as a plot outline, \\"Room\\" lacked suspense. Technically, \\"Room\\" is a work of fiction, but just barely. The character of Jack is well-done and touching - his worldview is unique and interesting. But, that's not enough!    I had a hard time caring about Jack when I knew what was going to happen to him. If you're a \\"Law and Order\\" fan, meaning that you don't mind plots that make no apology for the fact they're \\"straight from the headlines\\", then you might really enjoy \\"Room\\" (as many people have). However, if you want suspense and originality, not just in the characters but in the Actual Story, then reading \\"Room\\" is a waste of your time.
B002ZG981E|2.0|I feel I'd be doing a disservice if I didn't try to compete in depth and in scope with all of the other current excellent reviews. So I'll go in the opposite direction and keep my review short and to the point.    If you're a fan of the original Matrix, you'll either view this movie in one of two ways -    1. as a nostalgic echo to that mind-trip you experienced the first time you saw the Matrix in 1999, with some new twists and turns and razzle-dazzle FX    2. as a cheap rip-off of the quite solid Matrix story, now turned slightly convoluted... with fx thrown in to try and prop up the weaker storyline    I would say I fall into camp 2.    While I enjoyed the ride as it was going, it was quite forgettable after.    Heck, even the poster is a rip on the Matrix. You have the whole crew, holding guns, with a steel blue backdrop. Replace backdrop with a steel blue cityscape and you have Inception.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I am doing a five star to counteract too.  But this is a wonderful film and I liked it better than the first one.   The fashion, the fun, the story, it was all a hoot.  I found this film much funnier and much sexier.  Love it and cannot wait to see it again.
0312330537|5.0|The briefest 900 pages I've ever read. A fantastic story with engrossing, compelling characters in a world so expertly described, I feel I was along for the journey. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B002ZG981E|3.0|While this film has many great aspects to it: The acting, special effects and a compelling topic; I couldn't help but feel overall disappointed with this film.    Despite the abundant action packed sequences, \\"Inception\\" left me bored.  This is most likely due to the fact that the movie is close to nothing but 3 hours of fending off enemies that are nothing but nameless faceless \\"white blood cells\\" defending the subconscious.  It just felt like it dragged on forever.  That along with the fact that I felt zero attachment to the characters in the movie and an overly ridged dreamscapes made this film feel horridly sterile.    Not to mention, the film felt very jumpy.  As in it jumps from scene to scene to scene every few minutes.  In fact, the film may have been trying to pull off a feat so grand, that it leaves you thinking its all just a big jumbled mess not worth the frustration of following.  I can deal with a complex film, but I feel that the jumping around to all the scenes occurring simultaneously made the film lose focus.  In other words, I watched the movie play out, but it did not pull me into it.  I was a detached viewer, no emotional involvement whatsoever.  On top of that, the film was honestly very predictable and had very little in the revelation department.  You could always see the tracks before the train went over them so to speak.    One aspect of the movie that just completely dumbfounded me was that the film managed to be both imaginative, yet uncreative at the same time.  There is so much potential for creativity in a movie about dreaming, but this film decided to make the dreams seem more like virtual reality then actual dreams.    However, the biggest disappointed of this movie is the fact that everyone claimed it was an intelligent thinking mans film.  This film has not exercised one bit of critical thinking in my mind.  It feels overly superficial and hardly a film that can spark deep philosophical debate.  After watching \\"Inception\\" it did not have me contemplating the big questions in life one bit.  When it ended, it ended, and that was that.    In the end, \\"Inception\\" is not an intellectual deep thinking exercise, it is an average action film masquerading as one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|RIVETING! I could not put this book down, in fact, I finished the whole series within 5 days. If you loved the Twilight series, you'll love The Hunger Games series. If you HATED Twilight, you will still LOVE The Hunger Games series. Katniss makes up for all of Bella's deficiencies.<br />Collins proves herself a master at creating a world that feels so real you can't help but give a damn. She creates a believable post-apocalyptic dystopia with a sadistic head of state capable of the worst kind of crimes against humanity. Her characters are well-developed, wonderful and flawed all at once. But despite the machinations of the Capitol, humanity lives on. Hopefully young readers will see the parallels between Panem and the US, how quickly one could transform to the other if we allow our freedoms to slip away in the name of security.
0446195529|4.0|David Baldacci's latest novel is the fifth to feature the self-named Camel Club, which resides in the heart of Washington, D.C. Its leader is John Carr, aka Oliver Stone, a man with a secretive past who has done more than his share to serve his country. He is a former assassin and super-spy who has been through countless dangerous missions on behalf of the US and knows how to take care of himself and spot potential threats.    At the start of HELL'S CORNER, Stone is taken by the Secret Service to the White House for a face-to-face clandestine meeting with President Brennan, who calls upon him to take on a mission that involves infiltrating international drug cartels with bases in both Central America and Russia. Because of Stone's experience with Russia during the Cold War, and based on the fact that the post-9/11 CIA is comprised of mostly twenty-somethings, the President needs someone with his understanding of the trenches of espionage. But Stone is more than just a spy coming in from the cold, and his intuition tells him there may be an ulterior purpose to this mission.    Stone can't say no to the President, especially since he was responsible for eliminating two of his former allies --- Carter Gray and Roger Simpson --- in a prior Camel Club novel. Even though these two prominent Americans were caught on the wrong side of the fence, Stone still experiences guilt over taking down Brennan's friends and feels that participation in this mission would be a slate-cleaning act of penance that could also cost him his life. The mission never takes off as Brennan and the U.S. intelligence community have their attention refocused on an alleged terrorist attack that takes place in Lafayette Park.    Lafayette Park is in the shadow of the White House and Pennsylvania Avenue in an area that D.C. residents refer to as Hell's Corner. It is also where Stone and other members of the Camel Club resided during their years of government protest. Gunfire and an explosion in the parkraise the antennas of Homeland Security, the ATF, FBI, Secret Service, NIC, CIA and even the U.K.'s MI6. The public relations mess and massive red tape that will surely follow is something that Stone is tasked with cutting through. He is teamed with MI6 Agent Mary Chapman, the goddaughter of intelligence employee James McElroy and an ally from his past. Stone and Chapman view the videotapes of the explosion --- which he himself was present for --- and begin to analyze the pedestrians who were in the area.    Stone is approached by the other members of the Camel Club --- Annabelle Conroy, Reuben Rhodes, Caleb Shaw, Harry Finn and FBI Agent Alex Ford --- as they all offer their support. He turns them down out of respect for the secret mission he has been tasked with and also for their own safety. As he and Chapman follow lead after lead, they start to realize that the explosion of the bomb may have been unintentional, and the Yemeni Terrorist group that immediately takes credit for the bombing and shooting may only be a ruse. But who was the intended target of this attack? If they can determine this, they might be able to reverse engineer the actual people behind the plot.    This is easier said than done. As Baldacci deftly peels back layer by layer of this intricate plot, readers are taken through the frenetic paces of seeing each lead and potential suspect eliminated or wiped out before Stone and Chapman can get the information they need. They eventually realize that the detonation of the bomb may have been just a trial run to see if nanotechnology could actually change the molecular make-up of the weapon that would allow for it to escape even the detection of bomb-sniffing canines. Who could be behind this biological weapon delivery system, and could this signify a new way for the enemies of the U.S. to get to us, thwarting all of the defense systems currently in place?    Stone knows that this threat is more than he and Chapman can handle on their own, and theyfind they can't trust even their own leaders, who keep them in the dark time after time regarding information they need to effectively run their case. The Camel Club --- in addition to Stone's sometime ally, Joe Knox --- are called into action in a race against time as they know the next attack will be much bigger and could pose a threat to national security that dwarfs 9/11 in scope and terror. The plot moves at a breakneck pace and leads to a final showdown at the place where John Carr's career started --- Murder Mountain --- the secret training center of the Triple Six Division of the CIA, which has turned out the best killers to ever walk the planet.    HELL'S CORNER is David Baldacci at his best and features writing and plotting that only a master at the peak of his talent could accomplish. It literally will have readers at a loss of breath as every chapter seems to hold a surprising plot twist that even the shrewdest mystery fan will not see coming. Baldacci has created something that not many writers attempt --- a contemporary thriller packed with relevant and well-researched plot elements, combined with a whodunit style of murder mystery where every character and storyline is a potential clue or red herring. I highly recommend this novel and anxiously await what Baldacci will do next to top this thrill ride.        --- Reviewed by Ray Palen
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|I enjoyed Band of Brothers and was expecting a similar style and performance with The Pacific.    Unfortunately, this production was too ambitious and the producers tried to cover too much ground. Band Of Brothers centered around the actions of a handful of characters, from June 1944 to May 1945. The Pacific tries to cover the entire Pacific war --from start to end and also tries to work in character development at the same time.     As a result, the episodes were a bit scaterred and inconsisent and there were large gaps in time. An entire episode was devoted to the liberty antics of Marines in Australia. When your formidable goal is to try to cover the entire Pacific campaign and you only have 10, 45-minute episodes to work with, this probably is not the most prudent use of time.     As far as character development, it was spotty and the characters were not given enough screen time for a viewer to connect with any specific individual. I connected more with the characters by watching the bonus documentary than the film--the bonus biography sections were actually the best part of the set, IMO.     The action and visuals were well-done in typical Speilberg fashion. But I believe that the gore factor has reached it's limit. Viewers are now so used to seing this style that it has lost it's impact. We get it --war is bloody and violent. There are only so many ways to show someone with their insides hanging out before the viewer is desensitized to it and it serves no purpose. In many cases, it has become gratuitous in this style of film. It was riveting and schoking in Saving Private Ryan. It is now more often than not ust a distraction.      Unlike band of brothers, PAcific never gelled for me emotionally. It wasn't until Episode 9, based on Okinawa, that I started to feel somehwat of Emotional, simply Episode 9 in Okinawa. Ended abruptly without really knowing any more about the characters or.     IMO, the producers would have been better served if they would have set amore modest goal akin to Band of Brothers and started the series with the landing at Iwo Jima and followed through to the conclusion of the war. Pacific tried to cover too much ground by going from the homefront after Pearl Harbor all the way to to VJ Day and follow-up on the home-front.      I purchased the series based on reviews. I addedd this to my collection but I doubt it will get another viewing. It was not one of the best series to come from Speilberg.

B003V4AK8E|2.0|I bought this controller so that I (a never-have-owned-an-xbox gamer) could reap the benefits of a sensibly placed left analog stick. The controller isn't offensively terrible, there are just a number of things that weren't clear to me beforehand that makes this purchase regrettable:    (1) It feels lighter and less solid than the DualShock 3. It is well constructed (mostly) and isn't going to fall apart, but it just doesn't have that nice heavy-in-your-hands feeling to it.    (2) The analog sticks feel ever-so-slightly looser than the DualShock 3, and the \\"dead zone\\" complaint voiced elsewhere seems to be true to me. This just means that it requires more of a movement from the center point to register the first bit of movement in-game.    (3) The face buttons and d-pad are the worst part of the controller, in terms of quality of construction. The markings on the buttons look sloppy, the buttons wiggle, and are a little softer in terms of resistance.    (4) The grips have a texture to them that unfortunately comes across a bit too hard and sharp for my tastes. I have women hands (sorry ladies) so maybe I'm oversensitive, but I found them at the very least uncomfortable and a partial nuisance.    I bought this and used it as my sole controller for just over a month, and last night I finally put it down. The DualShock 3 just feels better, sad as I am to say it. I want nothing more than less expensive alternatives to Sony.

However, I randomly came across it, loved the front cover (yes I judged from the front cover) and flicked through it.  Wow its a visually sexy book.  Full of red, white, black, grey.  My fave colours.  Glossy pages, some photos (nowhere near enough photos), typewriter fonts.  I love that sh-t.  Didn't really care about Nikki Sixx or Tommy Lee.  The way Tommy presents himself is a total turner-offer. However, this book was cheap. Got home and couldn't stop looking through it. Then I started at page one and in the space of a couple of days had finished it.  Wow.  A completely gritty intoxicating read.  It's definitely one of those fascinations with the morbid or macabre (I have a fixation with looking at grisly crime scene photos on google).  Reading this was like that.  Other people have already said what it's about, I don't need to reiterate.  However, I did read all the 1 and 2 star rated entries and I agree with a majority of them too.  It does feel glorified, repetitive, misanthropic, rambling, pitiful.  Those are all true.  It does repeat the same themes: Bought smack, shot up smack, did some blow, mum and dad abandoned me, I'm seeing Mexican midgets, I'm paranoid, here's a graphic description of the needle going in, here's my latest obsession, dysfunctional \\"relationship\\" with Vanity, can't be bothered with my band anymore, don't care about life, why do I keep f-king up, I want to die, I love music.  But apart from that (lol) my point is this: even if you are NOT a fan of MC, this gut wrenching, uncomfortable, grisly, grimy, seedy, sleazy, pitiful,  incredibly sad, sometimes humourous (although maybe it shouldn't be....) graphic art styled diary novel will have you hooked.  The book itself is an addiction.  You will come away wanting to find out everything you can out Nikki Sixx, and actually taking the time to listen to Crue albums even though you NEVER liked them.  If you weren't a fan before, you will become one.  As the resident non-conformist, I conformed.<br /><br />(It doesn't hurt that Nikki was a very VERY good looking man - even when he was wasted).find out everything you can out Nikki Sixx, and actually taking the time to listen to Crue albums even though you NEVER liked them.

B001NHNG64|3.0|Why in the world are publishers ripping off consumers by pricing kindle books so high???  The manufacturing cost of a paperback > manufacturing cost of an e-book, so why are publishers charging so much??  Especially for a book published 12 years ago.        There is no way the Kindle price of this book should be greater than the paperback edition!!
B0006419J6|5.0|I actually order a lot of movies and I wanted these for Christmas gifts. Sometimes the delivery takes a long time. I was happily surprised to find that the movie got here really quickly.  That gives me time to watch it myself for a little while before giving it away....just to make sure it plays correctly, of course.
1934609625|5.0|Hide My Eyes is one of Margery Allingham's later and darker Albert Campion mysteries.  If you liked Tiger in the Smoke, you will like this too. The settings and psychology are fascinating and believable.<br /><br />It is quite interesting to see how much Allingham's Campion mysteries, and the character of Campion, changed from the early books to the later.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|I was having a hard time finding some of the rare Beatles material. \\"With the Beatles\\" is an album that I had not heard of and contains the songs I was looking for.  This remastered work reminds me why we loved Beatlmania so much. The music is warm and clear and sounds great! I am very impressed with the music as well as Amazon's extensive library!
B003WKOLQO|5.0|Before I start - please note this album is now finally available as a digital download for about $9 so do not go for the physical import copy for $24 or whatever it is....  Anywhoooo....Volbeat...a band over these last few years who have been refreshing, different, catchy and just damn COOL! It is rockabilly metal with a German accent! Tinges of Misfits, Metallica, 50`s teddy boy music and attitude and well - that`s your Volbeat recipe and it is awesome.  Beyond Hell/Above Heaven just moves these lads up another rung. It`s still Volbeat but you can tell they have progressed technically and there is obviously a bigger production budget. As with all their previous albums they sound fresh and essential. What more do you need?   PS : I have never felt the need to put in an Amazon review for anything before ever but Volbeat deserve to be heralded from every rooftop.
B0036EH3U2|4.0|The show is great and the blu-ray is really good.<br />The packaging still sucks and that's why I only gave it four stars.<br /><br />I do wonder why we are getting spread over the barrel price wise.<br />The price of the set seems to be hugely expensive over other similar shows.<br />A good example would be Farscape. I got that last year for 59.00 for all four seasons on like 26 discs.<br />I don't say that to criticize Amazon. When I bought my BSG set Amazon was the cheapest.
B003VB5E2E|5.0|I attended the Crossroads concert and I must say even the blu ray does not come close to the incredible sound of a stadium full of line-array speakers-however I do love the behind the scenes and artist close up footage that you just don't get at the Live event-This blu ray sounds ten times better than the theatre version but that may just be because of the lousy theatre I saw it in. It is mixed extremely well and is a pleasure to watch, although it is not done in the chronological order of the performances. I agree with others that less Jimmy Vaughn and Citizen Cope would have allowed for more Jeff Beck or some of the other incredible sets we saw at the concert. The concert was one of the most amazing events of my life and these discs capture the hi-lites admirably. I wish they could just release the whole concert-maybe do a volume two-i would love to have it all, even the mundane, just as a keepsake! You will not be disappointed in this purchase if you have at least a decent sounding home theatre set up!
1401324029|1.0|Ugh.  I can't believe I read that whole book.  Silly me thought it would actually get better.      Nikki Heat is a NYPD detective.  The author constantly tells us how great Nikki is.  She is Sensitive, Tough, Brave, Compassionate, Smart.  Don't forget now! But if you happen to, the author will remind you in just another paragraph or so. Her cohort, Jameson Rook, is a journalist.  He is just plain smug, clueless, and annoying.  Together the dynamic duo investigate the crime of a murdered gossip columnist.     An overdrawn plot, flat and colorless main characters, and way too much of the author being enthralled with his own writing. I wish I was half as enthralled as he was.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|If you just want the movie without all the extras, this is perfect. Yes, you can wait for the more expensive version with deleted scenes. But if you don't care about that stuff, just get this. It's so much fun to watch on a good HD tv.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|\\"Robin Hood\\"  --------------------------------  My wife and I are both big Robin Hood fans, and think that Ridley Scott is a great (\\"Blade Runner\\") director... But, oh my god, what a lousy movie this was.  The script is terrible -- flat, preposterous, unsurprising and uninteresting at every turn. Plus, it completely warps the Robin Hood legend and denudes it of its essential character, in oh, so many ways. It's really just not a good film at all. Mildly engaging in parts, but ultimately not worth your time... And if you are a Robin Hood buff, chances are you'll really hate this film. It's pretty skippable. (Axton)
B003L77GRO|5.0|I GOT HOOK ON THIS SHOW THE FIRST SEASON CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT ONE. KEEP ME IN EDGE TRUELY LOVE IT.
B003EYVXSW|5.0|ok, i had VERY low expectations for this film... and it totally went above and beyond.<br />it is creepy<br />it is TWISTED<br />and it has hung on and haunted me...<br />I failed to notice the very small cast until afterwards.. it totally kept me- mostly because I was just grossed out the whole time... the thing that scared me is that it isn't far from where science actually is...<br />it wasn't the best film ever, but totally haunting & with me anyhow, it has lingered...
0312600844|1.0|I am half way through and not sure I want to invest the time to read the rest.  My first complaint is about the characters.  Franzen writes about a woman in this book that is so unbelievable that I felt indifferent towards her.  Some men writers just shouldn't have a main character a women, he doesn't get it.
B003UBTX7C|2.0|This time out, the author fails to hit his mark. The story is rambling and not very believable. A big step backwards for the author.
B002SQ3664|5.0|This is NOT a documentary about the shows at Woodstock and there is absolutely no footage of the show. In fact, the show may be the back story for the movie, however, the movie is about what went on AROUND the show, before, during, and after, for a particular family and the quirky characters who lived in the town that somewhat unwillingly hosted the festival.<br /><br />It's a very fun movie and the various characters are quite amusing. Essentially this is the story about a young Jewish man who has all types of grand schemes to help his parent's failing motel. He usually puts on music festivals featuring local, teenage \\"talent\\" and has grandiose ideas about turning his parent's dumpy motel into an international resort. His parent's hotel is one summer away from being foreclosed upon and he overhears that a large music festival with big name musicians such as Joan Baez, The Grateful Dead, etc. has just lost it's permit in a neighboring town. He calls the producers and arranges for them to visit the town as a possible alternate venue for the festival. The majority of the story is about the main character, his parents, and the various characters who come to stay at the motel to prepare for the festival.<br /><br />My description doesn't do justice for the film - just know that the movie is quite amusing with quirky, interesting characters and the humorous interactions between them. In the end the festival ends up having a very positive effect on the main character, his depressed \\"dead inside\\" father, and his very crotchety and hardened mother.<br /><br />Both my husband and I thought this was a very fun, entertaining docudrama movie. Even if you have no interest in Woodstock what-so-ever you will very likely enjoy this movie. My husband is somewhat of a conservative, corporate America type and he really liked the film.<br /><br />Note: there are a few brief scenes with frontal nudity, both male and female. It is done in a way that supports the ideals and feeling of freedom from the 1960's and is NOT presented in a sexualized manner.<br /><br />Summary: Fun movie with quirky characters. Very enjoyable - even for those with no interest in Woodstock, the 1960's or Hippies.T presented in a sexualized manner.    Summary: Fun movie with quirky characters. Very enjoyable - even for those with no interest in Woodstock, the 1960's or Hippies.
B004097IKW|4.0|The most revelatory aspect of this recording is the inclusion of several sections usually cut in most performances. It had always seemed that the final mad-scene and closing drama were too crash-bang fast and the story is over. Now with the addition of the second part of the Elvira and Arturo duet \\"Ah! Perdona ...ell'era misera\\" and the following andante sostenuto cantabile give greater depth of understanding to mental health of Elvira and the deep devotion of Arturo. A second addition is the cabeletta in the finale of the opera between Arturo and Elvira which again adds weight to the drama. Perhaps as important as these additions is the one in the first act which is a trio for Arturo, Enrichetta and Riccardo. This is very fine music and it adds weight to the charachter of the hostage queen. In this recording the queen is played by Nadia Pirazzini who gives an excellent performance. These three additions add about 15 minutes or so to the opera but I feel greatly enhance the dramatic validity of the score. As for the Elvira, Ms Machaidze is just starting her career and is no match for Netrebko who is no match for Gruberova und so wieder. Non of these are real bel cantos but Edita comes the closest. I thought Ms. Machaidze did well at portraying a deranged damsel. Juan Diego is the star. Enough said. The kind uncle portrayed by D'Arcangelo was also excellent. The Sir Riccardo of Viviani was disappointing. He needs more vocal training. The sets were closed in, dark and dull but thats what Puritans deserve. The spirited conductor Michele Mariotti did the best he could with the resources he had. In all, this DVD is a keeper and I'll play it often.
B004B8RWX0|5.0|This is by far the best zombie action/drama I've seen. Story, effects, characters are great. If you liked Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, anything of that sort, you'll love this series.
B000FZETKC|4.0|This is a great movie that not alot of people know about.It has great music (picked out before the movie was made!!),and it launched the careers of several of it's stars. I am not a teenager but I really enjoy this movie for the wit and the music.I think alot of people can relate to this movie.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|The season is incredible, the blu-ray packaging and content is the high quality you would expect.  The extra features are shot in HD and are interesting to watch.  I particularly enjoyed seeing how all of the producers and executives told the real life stories of their experiences that triggered the ideas for some of the episodes. The show does a great job of blending humor and positive family messages without the cheeziness found in older sitcoms like full house.  The blu-ray set is highly recommended for anyone interested in the show for the first time or as a repeat viewing.  I have already viewed most episodes 2-3 times and each time I catch something new.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I have been following the comic book ever since it came out and still am. Now with that in mind, I have to say when i heard there was talk of the story being turned into a movie or series, I was very excited.  2 some years later here we are and I have to say YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO NOT WATCH THIS. Some may brush it off as oh...it's another zombie movie. Its really not. The story in the comics and in the series is focused on human reaction and character in the face of a zombie apocalipse. Yes there are zombies, Yes theres everything you can expect from a zombie movie but the deeper meanning of this shows lies within character development and the way they interract in the face of desperation.    Potential SPOILER!      The story deviates slightly from the comic book. The author did not originally think there would be such a HUGE demand for this thus tried to get through his story in order to avoid cutting the story short.  The director of the film worked with the author and developed the story a step further where there was room. As a result there are a few extra characters in the story thus far but I am sure they will die off in order for the story to move along to its next step.    the potential spoiler is that in the comic, the author builds up a group of survivors and then due to a tragic attack many of them die. this happens on numerous occasions. so be prepared for a wild ride, and DONT MISS THIS!!!!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|We are great fans of Richard Gere, and we are also dog lovers. This was a very well made movie about a very loyal dog who loved his master. We loved the movie so much that we ordered 5 copies, one for each of our grand children.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I didn't have a lot of expectation for this movie, but didn't know it was this bad.  It's boring and looks like POS.  You'll have more than 10 times better time watching great videos on Vimeo than this over-rated and over-hyped cult garbage movie.  I doubt that it was more of marketing than the quality of this movie that made it a hit.  I can't believe some people may pay to buy this DVD.  I'm glad that I didn't pay to watch this in theater.  I watched on Netflix instant play.
0399536108|1.0|The author should check the meaning of non-conformity not only in a dictionary but through the reading of people who were \\"real\\" non-conformists.  His book has no value as an example of non-conformity. All I see in this book are the rants and raves of an immature little boy who has a problem with authority figures.  I read the other reviews of his book and indeed it feels like the authors of those reviews read a different book than the one I read on my kindle.     At best, some of his examples of people who work \\"differently\\" than most would fit the qualification of \\"creative\\" but hardly non-conformist.      Tell us about living off-the-grid, about growing your own organic food, about developing alternate lifestyles (and I don't mean just based on sexuality), about chosing not to over-populate the world with your own progeny, about resisting the health-care hysteria of the moment, about living healthy without the help of main-stream medicine, and tell me about culture and respect for what thinkers who came before left us as their legacy.  And if you want to travel, don't count how many countries you'll see in the shortest amount of time.  But tell us how the customs of other peoples around the world have so much to offer for our own growth that it justifies the time and expense of getting to know them.  And if you really want to be a non-conformist, begin by acknowledging that a life well-lived is not the privilege only of citizens of the United States but of any human being around the world regardless of how difficult their circumstances may be.
0688014291|5.0|I had read this 'classic' years ago.  In a new management role, I thought it would be good to refresh myself.  I learned that it's never too late to visit this philosophy and it should be reviewed once a year at least.  Blanchard is one of the most prolific speakers on Management I have ever experienced.  I know why when I read his books and experience how he's able to simplify the hard stuff and make the information relevant for anyone.
1401309666|4.0|I thought The Long Tail by Chris Anderson was a very interesting read.  The main discussion focused on the explanation of the long tail and how society is moving from a \\"hit\\" based culture to more of a niche culture.  The Long Tail is really talking about all of the possibilities available for a given product or service.  The more alternatives exist, the more people will spread out their consumption and focus on the solution that makes the most sense for them.   While there are certainly still hits that drive the market, the level of impact and awareness of a given hit is less than what is was in the past.  The sum of all the other non-hit experiences out there adds up to represent a significant piece of the market.  As our culture shifts away from a mainstream mindset (made up of a small amount of hits that everyone consumes) and moves toward a large number of niche options that cater to specific interests, we will see a flattening of the demand curve that illustrates a large opportunity for success in the marketplace.      While reading this book, it's easy to see how the theory of the long tail has more power than ever considering the web based society we live in today.  Certainly the tools and technology of the modern age make it all the more possible to connect like-minded individuals and expose them to a variety of experiences that meet their specific needs.  This dynamic has obviously driven the development the niche marketplace.  A more powerful observation though was Anderson's demonstration of the power of long tail throughout history.  The example of the early beginnings of Sears and Roebuck was really interesting because it demonstrated that this theory of people wanting more options and a more specialized experience has always been present.  It has just been amplified now that technology has the tools to tie the core elements of success together. In the past, companies were obviously limited to finite shelf space and very real cost considerations that made business decisions to cap inventory necessary.  As a result, the product offering of any given firm was limited.  In the online world we live in, these physical limitations of inventory space or even geography have been erased, making it possible for businesses to offer more and expand their reach further than ever before.  With the falling cost of inventory, companies can offer much more variety, and in turn, realize sales that were not possible in the past.
B002ZG99CM|4.0|Just amazing! I thinks it gets the spirit of the first movie and makes it modern. The Smith kid is really good actor. I've have a good time with it.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|I admit oprah spilled the beans on some of the bonus featured but very liitle lol - I want to start off by talking the bonus features extensive and great - I was part of behind the scenes and learned alot . I love this version of Robin Hood as I did not like costner's. The packaging of the blu ray/dvd is gorgeous - if u love the movie and have or will get a blu Ray player - this is a must have.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|a great read in so many ways and on so many levels    such insight in to lfe then and now

B003EYVXSW|1.0|The movie was ok until zoophilia takes place. Then after that you either conclude that you have serious mental problems or your press the stop button. Luckily I did the latter. The weird creature was on big signs everywhere in LA. It has a kind of a shocking look, kind of like a baby with birth defects. Yes, you heard me correctly, this was showing everywhere in commercial signs around LA. I can respect people's taste for \\"art\\" but that means I am also entitled for mine: Disgusting.
B003GAJLGA|4.0|I am a new comer to the series and I must say I am very pleased by this seasons work. The stories have progressed and the characters have evolved perfectly. Season five is one of the best seasons of the series and this episode is great.<br /><br />Jensen has developed in to a very fine actor and this episode is one of his best efforts. I would love to see this show receive the recognition it deserves. I originally was under the impression it was a show for teens but after my son kept suggestion it to me and then loaned me season two I was hooked. I had to borrow the rest on the seasons from family members and finally Amazon online video.<br /><br />The perfect evolution of these characters and story lines is not something you often see in TV shows these days. I hope the writers can keep it up through season six and hopefully season seven (fingers crossed).
B000OSF33W|5.0|Love, Love, Love this episode. It will break your heart. You get to see Jared w/out his shirt on and making love to Madison (she wolf). Sam and Dean try to find a way to cure her of her werewolf affliction but to no avail. After a romp in the hay w/Sam Madison falls asleep in Sam's arms. Sleep is when she turns in to a she-wolf. Madison escapes and probably kills someone. (she is not sure)<br /><br />Sam receives a frantic call from Madison, he and Dean bring her back to her apartment. They all realize there is no way to cure her and she must die. Madison asks Sam to shoot her, Sam tells her no he can't do it. Dean offers to do it but Sam changes his mind...Jared gives one of the best crying scenes in the history of television as he walks to the room to shoot Madison.<br /><br />Jensen Ackles, gives a superb performance as always and the last scene as he watches Sam walk to shoot Madison...you hear the gun shot and Dean flinches and then he drops one huge tear down his chiseled cheek.<br /><br />I can not say it enough times-grab a box of tissues when you watch this one!
030014332X|5.0|I am a middle school history and English teacher and this is with out a doubt the best history book I have ever experienced.  Gombrich beautifully narrates the human experience and makes it clear to his reader why it was important------simply stated by a master storyteller.    I recommend this book to both old and young readers.  If you don't like history, you will like this.   If you do like history, you will be amazed by this.
B000NDRUQQ|5.0|I love when we are visited  by evil Sam. We do not get to see him enough. This episode Sam is possessed and kills another hunter. Sam fools Dean for a while but Dean figures it out in time to save Jo; who is being held hostage by Sam. Gun battle ensues and evil Sam shoots Dean...evil Sam goes to Bobby's house but Bobby gives him beer w/holy water in it. Once evil Sam takes a drink he is over come by the holy water and Bobby is able to punch him out.<br /><br />Dean and Bobby try to exorcise the demon from Sam only to find out he has a brand on his arm that has the demon locked inside him. Evil Sam proceeds to beat the snot out of Dean before Bobby is able to burn the brand and break the link.<br /><br />Jared did an exceptional job in this episode. He switched from evil Sam to brother Sam with precision. It was very interesting to watch his facial expressions as he switched characters. The scene with Sam and Jo in the bar is well acted and directed. The verbal battle between the brothers during the gun battle is perfect!<br /><br />This episode and Dark Side of the Moon are my two favorite episodes of the season.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I've always been a BattleStar Galactica fan and watching in in HD, in full clarity is worth every penny. If you're a fan of the series or have the series on dvd already, or a new fan of the series, you should definitely upgrade to Blu-ray. WORTH IT!
030726999X|5.0|WOW!!!!! This was the last book of a wonderful trilogy. Best three books of the decade. Should get 10 stars.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|Disappointed!   Such a beautiful voice and such a waste because of the producer.  Bad song choices; not one is a stand out which I want to hear again.   David Foster produced 5 star albums for Groban in which all or nearly every song was a masterpiece.   The change in style is a clear flop.   Cheesy songs include If I Walk Away, which sounds like a plinky yukule waltz; and Galileo; Voce - in which his gorgeous voice competes with an annoying drummer, banging away as if wanting too much attention.   I hate London Hymn which sounds like a church song with a creepy choir.   Good songs are L'Ora and Higher Window (although lyrics sound religious - yuck) and Hidden Away is good.   Josh:  Let David Foster produce your next album!   He is an annoying egotist - but knows how to produce - especially your kind of music.   Also, many of the songs on this and your last CD have simple, cheesy lyrics set to waltz rhythms which become too sing-songy.   Get a good lyracist.  Groban should have won 10 Grammies by now.   He won't win any with this badly produced CD.
B000W04S6U|5.0|My 13 year old Grandson absolutely loved it. It arrived before it was scheduled to.I will definetlt buy again.
B003KUSUSQ|3.0|I really like this CD except that it didn't say when I bought it that it was the revised copy.  Meaning that all the bad words were taken out of the songs.  There are a few songs where I don't even know what they are saying because all the bad words are cut out.  If I knew this about it I would not have bought it.
B000HEVALC|2.0|I bought this like everyone with very high expectations, but what I got was extremely POOR sound quality.  About all you can hear is Elvis, and not all that well, singing.  As nice as it would be to have ALL singers creating a true quartet, this just isn't what you get.  Save your money.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|When I first heard Mariah was going to release a new Xmas album, I didn't think she would do a good job as her 1st one 16 years ago. But Mariah proved me wrong. This set is AMAZING. Great vocals, you have a mix of everything on here uptempos,slow jams,ballads its very good. I LOVE 'Christmas time is in the air' sounds like something str8 out of the 50's. 'when christmas comes' is very soulful a Donny Hathaway kinda song very nice vocals on it. I bought copies for family members for christmas will be playing her 1st xmas album and this one back 2 back for many, many years to come.
0143039482|5.0|If you were forced to read \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" in high school, and a few years have passed, it's worth going back in for another read.  The story is an American classic.  A common grocery store clerk, Ethan Hawley, is shamed by his lowly status in a small town where his family name was once held in esteem.  Believing that wealth and power will bring back that respect, Ethan sets in motion a series of events designed to return affluence to his family and political power to himself.  Of course, the scheme has its victims, including those against whom Ethan is seeking revenge, and ultimately Ethan himself.<br /><br />Published in 1961, \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" was Steinbeck's last novel.  Some may criticize the book for its lack of subtlety.  To be sure, the key theme -- the moral corruption of America -- surfaces throughout the novel's pages, and permeates many of its characters.  While it may be true that Steinbeck avoided his usual nuance in crafting this story, to me this doesn't take away from the enjoyment of reading it.
0141192429|5.0|What makes THE WOMAN IN WHITE such an entertaining classic for the modern reader is its very lack of convention such that modern mystery/thriller authors employ. Collins may be as mindful of type as any of his Victorian contemporaries, but he never forgets that readers enjoy fully rounded characters, whose heroes and villains are not entrapped by mere melodramatic tempo. Hartright, the main protagonist, has his charm as the proto-type of the Etonian schoolmaster, but his place in the ranks of Victorian society is duly set, his innocent stumble upon his adventure with Anne Catherick is suspenseful and mysterious, his alliance with Marian Halcombe has you rooting for victory, and his surprising abilities toward the end of the novel leaves you rewarded for your efforts.<br /><br />And Count Fosco! The man is, first and foremost, a human being, and in comparison to the modern serial predator, a delight. Amusing by turns, funny, cultured, sinister, he lives in your mind as one of the most original bad guys in the world of English letters-- but Collins shows this respect for his lesser supporting characters, even the lawyer!<br /><br />My edition is slightly older than the Penguin issued here, but this is the kind of heartening masterpiece you will be inclined to pass on to your children.
B000GCFF3E|5.0|I had read this book several times growing up and loved it. Thought I would give it a try again now that I'm older and I still love it!!
B004132HZS|5.0|I've loved the first two episodes that I've seen.  Very fun and witty.  Martin Freeman is perfect as Watson and really makes the show for me.<br /><br />The only thing that keeps bugging my brain is how these modern-day characters live in a world where the fictional character of Sherlock Holmes never existed.  The word and name Sherlock Holmes is such a part of our everyday speech that when we hear Sherlock, in these modern adaptations, introduce himself to a character I almost want that character to crack up, thinking that they're being put on.  And no one can jokingly say, \\"Elementary my dear Watson...\\"
B00026WU4G|5.0|Honestly the weakest song on this is sweetheart like you and even then its not a bad song, I mean  a sweetheart like YOU being here? What the hell am I doing here? But this album rocks especially the SACD- hybrid version. Seems like the most beutiful girl to ever crawl across cut glass to make a deal.
0743297334|5.0|Besides [[ASIN:0743253426 Islands in the Stream]] I have to say that The Sun Also Rises is my favorite Hemingway novel. Hemingway writes about love that can never be and does so with some of the best writing ever put to paper. The Story follows Jake Barnes, whose mysterious war injury has left him unable to procreate...and thus, he will never fulfill the one thing that his true love, Lady Ashley, needs.<br /><br />From the nighttime streets of Paris, to the noisy Fiestas of Spain, we travel with a group of rambunctious American ex-patriots across two countries. Fighting, lust, and drinking are the highlights of the novel. Hemingway's writing style is nothing short of spectacular. His words are full of imagery and life. From tales of dancing in a musty Paris nightclub to trout fishing in a crystal clear Spanish lake. Hemingway paints the settings perfectly, and the story that goes with it is heartbreaking and at the same time beautiful.<br /><br />5/5
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|It was a solid reworking of the original 6 (5?) episodes with just enough new/changed material to merit a viewing or a buy if you're a fan.  There are just enough differences that there is space to change the plot and it makes a fan anxious to see the next entries, yet at the same time, no significant changes are present...yet.  I look forward to seeing where the rest of the movies will take the series.  The picture quality looked phenomenal to me but I'm not an avid bluray/HD viewer so it may not be that great (I honestly don't know).  Worth a buy if you're a fan, especially if you can get it cheap.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|We absolutely loved this movie.  It presented some of life's most valuable lessons in a totally new perspective and showed how many human weaknesses develop.  The acting was superb and kept my attention and interest throughout.  I adore the characters and the movie.  I think the plot was very well developed and presented.  A home run in all aspects!
0393964582|5.0|If you're looking at this, you're probably deciding between the many editions of this incredibly popular novel. The Norton edition remains my favorite version because of its extensive critical apparatus--notes, essays, and contexts. The novel itself is not such a difficult read at first, but this edition guides you through Romantic history and critical reception so that you can better appreciate Mary Shelley's achievement beyond pop-cultural revisions and Halloween costumes.<br /><br />Of particular interest is that Norton decided to give you the 1818 version of the novel instead of the 1831 one. Just a few decades ago, critics were telling us to read the later version because it was somehow considered the author's authoritative final draft. Not only does this edition provide you the now preferred 1818 novel, but it also gives you Anne Mellor's essay about _why_ we should prefer the earlier draft.<br /><br />If you do enjoy the novel, I'd recommend going on to read Shelley's later novel _The Last Man_ (1826). In many ways, this later novel is a sequel of _Frankenstein_. It is much longer and denser, but it provides a very satisfying counterpoint to the youthful radicalism of the earlier novel. Even if you don't get to _The Last Man_, though, _Frankenstein_ is certainly worth a read by itself.

0596805888|5.0|This is a really great book. If you see the title of the book and are intrigued, you will not be disappointed. It demystifies a ton of kitchen science and explains it in a really interesting way. Be aware though, that this is not a cookbook - the recipes are simple and illustrative, rather than the best version of a given recipe. The science and explanation for why a given recipe or technique works is great though. This book convinced me to get an immersion circulator, which has been really fun to play with.

0786955554|4.0|I agree with the other comments about the good quality and broad range of tiles provided. The tile imprinted box is especially nice as an easy way to include elevated terrain. I don't have a bunch of sets so I don't see the inclusion of tiles from out-of-print sets as a problem.<br /><br />I'd definitely suggest this set to anyone not already well stocked with tile sets.
B00003CXD5|5.0|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre begins happily enough, with two men down on their luck, barely scraping by day to day.  Anyone would think at this point they have it rough, but the beauty of this film is that, by the time the film is over, we see that it was then they were happiest.<br /><br />Going to get the gold paranoia and greed set in slowly and surely, in a way seen in almost no other movie (at least as well as it was done here).  One can hope the human condition will survive intact, but in reality we're all a stone's throw from stabbing fellow man in the back for just a little more money.<br /><br />Powerful, superbly acted and written, Sierra Madre comes with my highest recommendations.
B003YOZNBU|3.0|After reading several mixed reviews on Jonah Hex, I was a bit hesitant to watch it.  But the film was not bad all.<br /><br />Sure it's not \\"according to Hoyle\\" per the DC Comics canon, but so what?  It's a western.  And what a western it was -- very dark however, and not a lot of humor in it.<br /><br />Even so, Jonah Hex as a man whose only sin was to disobey Confederate orders to burn a hospital and killed those who got in his way, was himself forced to watch his own wife and son die at the hands of his commanding officer, Turnbull.<br /><br />Hex was tortured and half-dead; through some Indian magic and medicine, Hex gained the ability to talk to the dead.  I guess the pun horse (or ghost) whisperer comes to mind!  The film does not overuse this feature and is mostly a shoot-em-up, gun slinging story about a man who is given a second chance, although is methods are not exactly moral or legal.<br /><br />It is chilling when Hex is told by a man he had killed some time back that Hell has a special treatment for him.  He can wait.  First, he must hunt down Turnbull and stop him from using an extraordinary weapon that can level cities.<br /><br />The fact of a weapon of such magnitude and thus the South shall rise again was a bit unreal and I don't believe such was possible in 1876 (the time of this story).<br /><br />Megan Fox plays Lilah the prostitute and though her part is small, she looks great playing it.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />The whole film is stylized, like watching a slicked-up version of The Wild, Wild West.  I have no idea if this film will ever see a sequel but the only thing wrong with it was its darkness and unrealistic premises.<br /><br />The beginning of the film with its horrific start and torture and burning of family is indeed shocking.  The animation at the beginning is neat and stylized and the fading into reality is fun to watch.  The whole bounty hunter thing is touched on but not played up enough.<br /><br />The rapid fire editing and dark (underexposed) picture in many parts is hard to follow.  And things are burning.  Lots of fire and burning.  Sadly, the generally unfavorable reviews and the film not even getting close to breaking even with its $47 million budget could explain why we won't see a sequel soon.<br /><br />If the film stuck to the original Jonah Hex comics and drew a story out of that, stick to more Western and less hocus pocus (and a different gal than the cute but couldn't act her way out of a tight corset Megan Fox) then we would have seen a fun film worth watching.<br /><br />Still, fun to watch for its dark themes!  Wish there was more gun slinging and humor, and less ghost/mystery stuff.  Oh yeah, a more coherent plot would have been nice, too.<br /><br />DVD:  The DVD had a bunch of previews for upcoming films, but no special features, no \\"making of\\" or anything.

B0012GMXYM|4.0|I just recently discovered this, and it is a pleasure.  While not as impressive as the first album, Caravanserai, and Supernatural it is certainly worth the money and time.
0739321870|5.0|This CD set takes you on a rip-roaring paced tour through the development of cosmology over the last 500 years.  In four fast hours, the genius Hawking ties it all together, answering many questions, but asking about 100 more.  The fascinating history of how humans have advanced theories of how the universe works is so much fun to listen to.  It is awe-inpsiring how some of the early scientists figured out so much, yet it feels like as humans, we have only a grain of sand of knowledge compared to the beach that's out there.  If you're old enough to remember the \\"Billions and billions\\" of Carl Sagan, and how he brought science to the masses, you need to listen to this generation's genius, Stephen Hawking.      (As far as the audio edition goes, I like this one better than the other Hawking audio programs because it is read by a human reader instead of Hawking's weird computer voice.)    Thought-provoking, mind-bending, yet 90% of it is accessible to us mere mortals.
0800139151|1.0|The Quick and the Dead, 1995 film    This story is set in a tiny town in a desert. A bandit gang has taken over, and oppresses the people with high taxes and low wages. [Any similarity to your city, state, or country is purely coincidental.] This ruler is famous for his prowess with a quick draw of a pistol. [The quick draw fantasy was concocted by Eastern writers of fiction, although there may have been a few examples in the real west.] The ruler arranges gladiator contests using pistols to awe and amuse the townspeople (no other sporting events). Each gladiator has a personal history that is given as part of the story. There are personal conflicts as well, however fantastic they seem. Do not expect to learn anything, its just entertainment.    Of course there has to be some sort of moral, and ending where the good guys win over the villains. You'll see examples taken from horror films where the monster pops up after being killed and assumed dead. This works better in films with an unearthly creature. The styles of dress say the late 19th century. The isolation of this town (no railroads or stagecoaches) suggests an Arizona desert. There is no mention of mining or other production to explain this isolated town. Does this story have any redeeming social value? Not even as a costume drama. If you watch it closely you can estimate which scenes use doubles and the editing to hide this. There are better films that you can watch for entertainment and education.
B0006213WG|5.0|\\"Chuck\\" has more of the high-energy, unbelievable punk/rock/metal from the brilliant group Sum 41.  Musically, they have progressed even further than their earlier efforts, maintaining the fine balance between raw rock and listenability.  In this CD, their message is even darker than their previous work, and feel more personal in nature. While Fat Lip, Still Waiting, and In Too Deep had lyrics that felt universal, this CD feels more specific.  But the beat and crunchy guitars don't disappoint.  Sum 41 takes the best of punk, surf music and rock and roll it all up into a very tight, disciplined package.  Well done!
0140557741|5.0|I used this book as an activity when I was facilitating a workshop on leadership roles. We were able to make a great point of what type of leader you are by handing out pages of this book to have the group figure out how it goes back together. Worked wonderful! You could tell who was able to manage the group with only pieces of the big picture. Loved it!
0307594777|5.0|For a very low price, I got three beautiful hard cover books. I'm currently reading the first book of the series, \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.\\" The characters are introduced in great detail and the story begins to pick up and get more and more interesting at page 75 going forward. So far, I'm thoroughly impressed with Steig Larsson's writing. The story takes place in Larsson's native land of Sweden. It's too bad he passed away in 2004 and couldn't continue to produce more magnificent works as this three book series, \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,\\" \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire,\\" and \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest.\\"
B001ECQ75A|5.0|YES! Really!     I love everything about this movie: the story, the writing, the animation, the voice acting, the music, the setting: mystical China.     It's got the funny, the adventure, the heart.     Get it. Watch it. You'll love it.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Hard-drinking, migraine-suffering US Marshall Teddy Daniels is called out to Shutter Island when a violent criminal escapes from the mental hospital on the island. Teddy has problems; his memories of WW2 haunt him, as does the death of his wife in an apartment fire. He struggles to keep it together, as he wonders, privately, if he doesn't belong in a mental hospital himself. Teddy and his partner have to sift out the truth from fantasy as they interview the patients. But there is a common theme--the inmates are terrified, and there is a mysterious 67th patient who no one seems to know anything about. As they are drawn deeper into the asylum, toward Cell C, for the most violent patients, Teddy's grasp on reality slips further and further away.<br /><br />The character of Teddy is excellently played by Leonard DiCaprio; we feel his pain at his wife's death, share his trauma from the war; the dream scenes are particularly bittersweet and heartrending. And we get a glimpse into the horrors that passed as \\"medical treatment\\" in the 1950's.<br /><br />Shutter Island will constantly keep you guessing--what is real? What is sanity? How should the mental ill be treated? It is a thought-provoking and emotionally wrenching story that will stay with you for a long time.
0756659841|5.0|this book was purchased for my 8 yr old son who loved it from the minute he got it...keep with that book for hours,, what a great book for the money
1442337966|5.0|This audio book is wonderful; teaching how to use the steps to The Secret as daily practice.  You do have to get past the sound effects;they were a little distracting,but funny at times.  I loved it and would highly recommend this book.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|I ordered \\"Eating Animals\\" on a whim. I had never heard of the book before, but something had tugged inside about eating animals, especially the fact that we as consumers are so removed from the process of farming and meat preparation. I was curious what someone had to say on the topic.  I was a little skeptical when first starting to read this book, but through the book I learned so many things about the horrible reality of animal farming that I've decided to become a vegan, whereas before I was blissfully and ignorantly enjoying my bacon and chicken nuggets. Despite my occasional indulgence in fatty meats, I value nutrition and human health. So when I discovered that our current farming system is not only extremely cruel to animals (you don't have to be an animal right's activist to see that what is going on is wrong) AND detrimental to human health, I had to change my lifestyle. I believe everyone should read this book.
B001VFM60A|5.0|This DVD is a must have for any LP fan, it accurately portrays what it's like to be at an LP concert, Very good transition to Blu-ray, images are crisp and the sound is excellent, Highly Recommended!
B0044XV3QY|1.0|The movie itself is a 2/5 but with the huge amount of times it is being released I had to bump my review down a point. The movie was boring and brought nothing that has not been seen in dozens of other films. What did this movie have 3D and special effect. I could not care any less for 3D so that ruins and hope I had for this movie when it was over.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I already reviewed this movie some time back on the IMDB, but felt constrained there.  This time I'm going to let out all the stops.  So, here it goes.    You know, I really loved the theatre that was presented back in 1977 on the big screen.  I loved Star Wars.  I grew up listening to the soundtrack, and seeing the film a few times when it was rereleased in the theatres.  Is was and still is great entertainment.    But I'm not a Star Wars fan.  I truly am not.    I did not buy the action figures.  I did not buy the comics (mostly anyway), nor did I ever really get into the characters too much, though I loved imagining that far off place in a different time.  To me, that was my fandom of Star Wars.  I didn't need the games, the t-Shirts, the toys, ... bed sheets, and all the other paraphernalia that constitutes you're typical Star Wars fan.  I did not dress up as a Star Wars character for Halloween.  I did not own one of those light-saber flashlights.  I did not own the masks, any of the Super-8 films, and all the other Star Wars stuff that was put on the market.    So, why didn't I?  Because I liked the film for what it was.  I wanted to go there, but instead was happy to have the film as an experience.  I know that sounds crazy, but I think most people fall into this category.  Simply put, I'm a fan of the film and the reality presented, but I'm not \\"into Star Wars\\".    I don't know the characters, the circumstances beyond the great rebellion depicted in the films, nor do I have an understanding of the science and engineering of the various devices depicted in the movies.  I'm simply clueless as to the Star Wars' universe and its particulars.    And I think the reason is because Star Wars touches on a primal instinct that we all enjoy and feel attached to on an emotional level.  It's not high minded philosophy like other science fiction (Star Trek as an example).  Star Wars is basic human spirit and good verse evil type of stuff thrown up on the screen for all toenjoy.    There's a sense of reality there.  A real sense of plausibility that was married to the fantastical imagery presented to billions the world over.  And it worked.  Me, I never saw myself in any of the characters, but I think most of the characters touched us and reminded us of who we are.  In that sense I am a Star Wars fan.    I'm a Star Wars fan in the sense that this film and is sequels don't pretend to be anything else.  There's no \\"hidden\\" psychological agenda here.  There's no real social message encoded here, just a set of circumstances and personalities that are common enough to human history.  It's basic.  But it's also a bit juvenile.  Because there weren't any higher principles being worked with here I found the larger theme rather dry and immature.  It's great cinema, and I wouldn't trade my opening day experience back in 1977 for the world, but it's essentially an upgraded form of Saturday matinee cinema married to some magnificent visuals.  And that's why I am a fan of the film, but not a real Star Wars fan as such.    It's a play derived from material meant for a younger audience, and revamped for a slightly older folks, or rather young and old alike.  And you know what?  It works.  We have old fashioned basic filmmaking updated for an audience that was somewhat tired of cowboys and modern war; an audience that was looking towards the future or, at the very lest, to worlds beyond our troubled Earth.  A place where light and dark collide on the open battlefield, or in this case a militarized realm of outer space.  And that's what makes Star Wars such a remarkable film.  But, for all that, I'm still not a Star Wars fan.    And for those who know me, this will come as a shock, because I love some of the visuals depicted, and get excited to see and hear the films.  I truly think they're great cinema.  But again, I'm not what you would call a Star Wars fan.    I've owned the games, played them, listened to the magnificent score by John Williams, and, of course, watched the original films numerous times and enjoyed them.  But that's where I stop in my enthusiasm.  It's deep enthusiasm when I'm engaged, of that there is no doubt, but I don't carry it over to my real life, unlike the \\"true\\" Star Wars fan.    So, all in all I love these films as pure entertainment.  But that's about it.  Yes, I wish I could be there and run around with the characters, but I'm happy to sit with the rest of mankind and view their derring-do and other antics as an audience member, and not a character in the play.    Star Wars, the original film, is a lovely piece of film making.  It's one of the great pieces of cinema in my book.  And for that alone it's worthy of purchase.    Enjoy!
B002ZG980U|5.0|Yes, I said masterpiece.<br /><br />This is going to be difficult, since saying too much here is surely damaging to the movie going experience.  This film has been criticized as much as it has been praised, and all for the same thing, the depth of the script.  Yes, this film can be hard to grasp IF you aren't paying attention, but it really isn't too complicated to follow if you walk in with the right mindset.  My brother hated this film, but he went with a bunch of reckless teenagers who talked throughout the whole movie.  This isn't your typical action film; you have to actually `watch' this one.  I went with my wife.<br /><br />We LOVED it.<br /><br />Simply put, `Inception' is about a man named Cobb who, due to his profession, has been separated from the ones he loves.  His wife is dead and he has been charged with her murder.  If he returns to the states, he will be incarcerated.  So, for the time being, he is not able to see his children.  What it is that Cobb does is someone complicated.  He uses dreams to steal valuable ideas from influential people.  Using technology suited for this task, he enters the mind of the sleeping, builds dreamscapes inside their minds and creates an alternate reality that allows him to extract whatever it is he is paid to find.<br /><br />It's not as hard to follow as it sounds.<br /><br />At the films outset we are shown just how this works.  After a botched job, Cobb and his partner Arthur are given a proposition; to perform inception.  With this job would come the ability to return home and see his children.  There is a small problem though.  Inception is much different and much more complicated a procedure because it involves implanting an idea, not stealing one.  This is harder because it is a much deeper deception; for in order for the idea to take root and grow, Cobb and his team have to make it feel as though the `victim' has come up with this idea all on his own.<br /><br />It has to feel real.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has a huge following, especially after his brilliant `The Dark Knight', which garnered lots of praise, attention and even an Oscar or two.  While that film continues to grow on me in ways unprecedented (not really, but you get the picture...it is brilliant), there is no denying that Nolan continues to show the goods.  `Inception' is so smart it's scary.  Nolan understands that society in general gravitates towards the action film.  It is the big Hollywood summer blockbuster.  It is a way to make a lot of money.  BUT, Nolan also understands that big explosions and million-dollar effects cannot take the place of a smart and involved script.  He has continued to build a name for himself by marrying the two components beautifully, and `Inception' is no exception.  The film is complex yet free-flowing.  The pacing is exceptional.  The dramatic overtones are all there in spades, especially since the main characters are fleshed out and given life (Cobb becomes three dimensional, and his back-story is just as entrancing as the films actual plot without ever taking away from it).  Some have mentioned that the acting is standard fare, and then some have raved Leonardo DiCaprio and claimed this the best performance of his career.  I don't agree with either statement (best of his career...really?) but I came very close to writing this review as a `best in show' piece and somewhat Oscar FYC for Marion Cotillard, who is just plain OUTSTANDING in this film.<br /><br />Anyways, I decided not to (but a surprise Oscar nomination for her would be AMAZING and totally deserved).<br /><br />That said, this film is very, very good.  I fully expect it to snag a slew of Oscar nominations (including Best Picture and Best Director) and it will be deserved.  No, this film is not the best film ever made (come on fanboys, you are giving the film itself a bad name) but it is a truly impressive feat for the genre and it further cements Nolan's name as one of the most impressive and imaginative directors of his generation.irectors of his generation.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This version of Persuasion is my favorite so far. The acting by both main characters is excellant- I was captured in the moment by moment emotion. It really captured the class structure and \\"fee\\" of the time period. Recommend it highly !
B00275EGWY|4.0|It's hard when you wind up sweeping all film awards in a particular year.  It is almost guarantied that you are going to experience major backlash.  It seems that that has happened for the surprise juggernaut that was `The Hurt Locker' (seriously, who the heck saw that coming).  The film is not experiencing the same criticisms that so many other `Best Picture' winners have received in the past (just look at the films average rating on this very site).<br /><br />No, `The Hurt Locker' is not perfect.  In fact, I don't think it should have won the Oscar, even considering the Academy's underwhelming lineup (the film, while VERY good, is not better than Tarantino's masterpiece).  That said; this film is deserving of the praise and certainly undeserving of the backlash.<br /><br />The film centers around a bomb diffuser named William James.  James is a wild one.  He needs to feel the adrenaline rush of near death that so many in his company want to avoid.  He is not afraid of danger.  William gets moved into a new squad when their former leader is killed in the line of duty.  William is unlike anything this squad has seen before, and he almost instantly gets under their skin (but not in a good way).  They have just barely over a month together, but in that month the three main characters (Will, Sanborn and Specialist) undergo many emotional changes.<br /><br />Like most have already noted, this is not a war movie.  It reminds me in a way of Sam Mendes' underappreciated `Jarhead' in that it's main focus is on the men serving and not the service they perform.<br /><br />So, I have a few squabbles with the film.  For me, war movies run a very sharp risk of becoming one note and redundant.  `The Hurt Locker' falls into that department at times.  It becomes almost repetitive in the situations these men find themselves.  Yes, there are differences, but they can run themselves together.  It isn't as present a problem as in some other films, but it is there (for me at least).  I also had some issues with the films handling of the `Beckham' (when you see the film you'll know what I mean).  When Will goes out of his way to find the men `responsible' for what he fears has happened it adds depth to his character but it kind of takes you out of the film a bit.  It just appears far too unrealistic for me.  The final scenes also have that feeling (would three soldiers really do that?) but they fare better because of the emotional turmoil and ending revelations they stir up (that clothed shower scene is FLAWLESS).<br /><br />The films actual ending also felt a little `obvious', which I didn't care for.<br /><br />I know it seems like I'm picking on this film a lot, but really, when taken in perspective these issues are small.  The film is gritty and earnest.  Sure, it has moments where the honesty seems stretched a tad thin, but the character never feel anything short of sincere and real.  The film is visually stunning and completely tuned into the adrenaline rush running through Will's body.  The relationship that builds between the three main characters is engaging and it breathes reality.  While I found some moments to feel a tad `preachy' (I wasn't fond of the repartee between Specialist and his counselor) I also appreciated that the film took an obvious step `away' from being a `message' film.  It just let you dwell in that world and decide for yourself what your really think.<br /><br />Let's talk about Jeremy Renner.  What a brilliant performance.  Yes, he made it seem really easy (so it wasn't `wow look at me act' kind of brilliant) but that's what made it so brilliant.  It was honest.  Every smirk or hand gesture or sideways glance was completely lived in and real.  You never once doubted him and his commitment and his needs and his motives.  He wore everything on his sleeve, but not in the `obvious' way in which some actors approach a character.  He felt like you and me and everyone you know.  Anthony Mackie delivers his best performanceto date.  I have an issue with him as an actor because he seems to play a variation of the same character in every film (or he at least brings the same facial expressions to every performance) but he actually develops Sanborn in a way that feels sincere.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the slew of cameos from greats like Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes were highly appreciated.<br /><br />In the end this film is well worth your time.  It really works on many levels.  Sure, it isn't perfect (and `near-perfect' is even a stretch really) but it is forgivably flawed thanks to many elements (not the least of which was Kathryn Bigelow's fantastic direction...so much developed tension) that work just right.use he seems to play a variation of the same character in every film (or he at least brings the same facial expressions to every performance) but he actually develops Sanborn in a way that feels sincere.

0374532125|5.0|Should be compulsory reading at school to assure that coming generations do not do the same mistakes when it comes to Aid over again. The book can also be an excellent stimulation for creation of new ways of Aid and business models for the 4th sector.
B00102F5WK|3.0|Here is my issue with `Rendition'; it has a decent enough story, and the actors involved (all of them) are capable, yet nothing seems to come together fluidly since the film is too busy trying to make a lot out of very little.  The movie tries to expand on a single action (the rendition of an Egyptian born man suspected of terrorism) and show how it reaches out over the lives of many, but in doing so it manages only to stretch characters thin of really any emotional attachment.  We don't get to know anyone long enough to feel a part of their story, and the films timeline becomes confusing and (in the end) kind of preposterous (that's one way to tag a twist ending onto a film).  It just feels forced.  Thankfully the actors involved work hard to elevate their material, it's just a shame that the material isn't strong enough to support their performances.  The best in show here is easily Jake Gyllenhaal, who finally proves that he can walk amidst more consistent actors (Streep, Witherspoon, Arkin, Sarsgaard) and stand out.  The way he layers the guilt crushing down on his `CIA agent thrust into unfamiliar territory' is rather remarkable.  For as thin as the script is, he builds a solid foundation here.  Witherspoon could have been better, but she winds up feeling underdeveloped and unbelievable.  Naor is nothing but a stereotype and while Sarsgaard and Streep give spirited and `lived in' performances, the characters they are handed are paper thin and it is obvious that the film is uninterested in them (although their confrontation scene is one of the best in the film).  Sadly, we forget all about the `important message' the film is trying to relay about an `important subject' because nothing is focused.  In the end the film just tries to do too much while bearing very little fruit.

B0019EXZY4|5.0|I almost want to copy and paste the review provided by the site here because it kind of says everything I want to say.<br /><br />Seriously though, this movie is `cheerful, energetic, and completely entertaining'.<br /><br />Based on a true story, `The Bank Job' revolves around a heist that serves up so many twists and turns it's almost unbelievable and yet it all works so believably well.  Splicing together tidbits of information in a creative and engaging way, the film brings a 70's feeling of funk and joviality without ever losing the films harsh and gritty edge.  You root for the bad guys because there are obviously even `badder' guys running amuck here, and you hold your breath in suspense because you truly never know how things are going to end up.<br /><br />Set in the early 70's, the film tells of a group of amateur criminals who get conned into an `easy robbery', robbing a bank that will be unprotected for a short period of time.  The problem is that they what they are there to steal is property valued by many people (governmental and criminal) and when you toss in some corrupt police you have an `easy robbery' was winds up being much harder than expected.  When all is said and done, these petty thieves find themselves in far over their heads when all sides come in on them at once.<br /><br />Oh, but what fun it is to watch.<br /><br />The best thing about `The Bank Job' is that it never loses sight of its purpose, which is to entertain.  It is fun, 100% of the time.  It layers the scenes with an intensity that is masked with a veneer of spunk.  The performances are totally felt and in keeping with the films pace and humor (I think it's safe to say that this is Jason Statham's best film and best performance).  The films hodgepodge of sequences layered to create a patchwork of storytelling comes of spectacularly, leaving the audience scratching their heads just long enough to get them to pay close attention.<br /><br />There isn't much more to say here.  I loved this film and I'd be reaching if I looked for a notable flaw.for a notable flaw.
0765326353|4.0|The Way of Kings took me quite a while to get into the story, to understand its world, the system of magic, the political intrigue and to be able to map out how the cast of characters fit together in the overall scheme of things, but ultimately it was a fairly satisfying read once I gave it around 500 pages to get going.   The big issue I have with the book is that at 1000 pages, not enough really happens.  Back story galore, internal rationalizations and justifications, relationships explored, political intrigues dissected,  but all that detail almost threatens to stall out the story in places.  Obviously this is book one of what will be a large and many volume series, but for me it is hard to justify that many pages to what is in essence an intro.    As the back jacket does mention, there are four main characters whose stories begin to unfold throughout this volume, and they are each interesting in their own right.  If only Mr. Sanderson had not beat their stories into me over and over again, if he had sped things up a bit and moved the plot forward instead of delving into minute detail and the history of each character ad infinitum, taking literally hundreds of pages for significant things to actually occur.  Do fantasy authors get paid by the word, or does Mr. Sanderson just love to hear the sound of the keys on his keyboard that much?    When all is said and done, even with a story that develops at a glacial pace, this still promises to be the first in series that should hold your attention and be of interest to epic fantasy fans.  My personal opinion is that the story in this book could have been done justice in probably 500 pages instead of 1000 without losing anything of significance, but still the story offers a promise of an interesting and complex epic tale in the next 3000-5000 pages which are surely to come as the author cranks out subsequent books.
067101756X|5.0|Bottom line - this is a good book.  It's easy to read, the first-hand experiences and viewpoints conveyed by the aurhor are interesting, and the author was a decorated and relatively high ranking military officer.    Some other reviewers have expressed doubt that the development of lasers, supertenacity fibers, and other technologies was influenced by the introduction of alien technology, and that the author's claims in this regard cast doubt on his credibility.  That, I think, is an overly cautious conclusion.  It's plausible, in my view, that the author did have custody of some crash debris and did make a good-faith effort to introduce it into technology development projects, but that he overestimated his impact.  If so, he wouldn't be the first person to have over-rate himself.  Then again, maybe his work did have an impact...    Anyway, I would recommend this book to everyone, with the possible exception of hardcore skeptics, because they seem to be offended by any mention of UFOs
B000IDGDPA|4.0|first off i was surprised to see helen hunt playing the seductress in this movie. the movie, as other reviewers mentioned, did have some nice twists...that surprised me...so that made it pleasant.  overal a charming movie, romantic and some witty dialogue. if looking for a light weight light hearted romantic movie this is your ticket.
0439023521|5.0|I was caught off guard by how powerful and interesting this book was from beginning to end. I had heard a bit about it, and when I was looking for an audiobook at the library for a trip, this was what was available. From the moment I started listening, I was caught by the story, characters, and constant suprises. The landscape is unsettling, and the evil Capital just a little too close to possible. The book's heroine, Katniss, is truly intriguing as she is slowly revealed throughout the storyline. She's likable in her imperfection, and in her confusion about who she can trust and just how she feels about various characters, particularly Peeta and Gale. I was so hooked, that when my trip ended only 1/2 of the way through the book, I then bought the book so I could finish it as quickly as possible! I'm a mom to two teenage girls, who I'm encouraging to read the book ASAP. I suspect they will like it as much as I do. I can't wait to read the next installment . . .
B0001Z37HM|5.0|Red Sonja is a really moving sword and sorcery film. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger (from Conan the Barbarian) and Brigitte Nielsen. It also stars Ernie Rayes Jr. who later was in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II and Surf Ninjas. He plays a child king who has a trusty servant called Falcon played by Paul Smith. Sandahl Bergman who was Conan's love interest in Conan the Barbarian is the evil queen Gedren.    Red Sonja has her family killed by the evil queen Gedren's forces and she then trains to use a sword. Gedren attacks a temple her sister is at to get a stone of great power that she can destroy kingdoms with. Red Sonja finds out about what Gedren has done and goes on a quest to stop her from taking over the world.    The movie \\"Red Sonja\\" has breathtaking scenery. It also has a great soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. Brigitte Nielsen wields a sword well in the movie and the movie had great swordfights. There is also a lot of suspense. The comedy in the movie between the Ernie Rayes character and Falcon his servant is very funny. Arnold Schwarzenegger also has great chemistry between him and Brigitte Nielsen and their scenes together are very romantic. \\"Red Sonja\\" is a movie that combines fantasy adventure with comedy and romance.
1579128149|2.0|When I saw this book in the local Costco, I had to pick it up.  And then I had to buy it because I couldn't put it down.  A wealth of information, it discussed numerous applications of many of the elements that most people - often including myself - were unaware.  Many of the pictures were quite interesting as well, from everyday objects that use the particular element down to close-ups of the element itself (when possible).    Unfortunately, one item rapidly got repetitive, and a little ridiculous.  I'm talking about the author's constant monologue against the incandescent bulb.  It seemed like every few pages, there was another pithy remark.  Okay, we get the point, they're becoming obsolete; GET OVER IT!  Now we get to use the CFLs that the author praised so highly, and are more likely than not slowly poisoning us at a tradeoff for better energy conversion.    Without the annoying ongoing attack at the incandescent bulb, this book would get a rating of 4 stars or maybe even 5.  Unfortunately, the rapidly-tiresome comments have a really poor effect on the overall product.
0061122416|5.0|I have read this book in my 30s, 40s and now at 50.  I learn something each time I have read it.  I asked my children to read in while they were in their teens.  It is a wonderful book with message in form of a fable...
B0039W1J0Q|3.0|In this release, Peter reworks the signature songs of some incredible artists. This was done in exchange with these artists recording their favorite Gabriel tunes. Both albums, it was agreed, would contain no guitars and no drums. This is an interesting work on Mr. Gabriel's behalf, and althoughg it won't go down in my annals as his best work, it's still groundbreaking. It's good to experiement, and Peter Gabriel is not afraid to try something new. He doesn't appear to be motivated by commercial success, but rather the drive to create and to be unique. \\"Scratch My Back\\" is eclectic, and, at least for me, will take some time to digest. I welcome anything from him, because when his music speaks to you, it really grabs hold of your soul. I don't think anyone is better at using every aspect of his songs to convey a mood. From his soulful voice to his driving rythyms to his use of every possible instrument and world style, no one, in my humble opinion, does it better. The only complaint I would have about Mr. Gabriel would be the length of time between releases. Of course, if it didn't take as long as it does, it might not be as good, so I suppose it's a tradeoff I will have to live with. Like this particular album or not, Peter Gabriel is a genius, I think most people can agree on that.

1400052173|3.0|I think this book did live up to the hype of being a very interesting story albeit a sad one.  The book was a bit heavy on the science/biology front and lost me during certain parts.  All in all i did enjoy hearing about the writers journey to uncover Henrietta's story.

B003YFIUW8|2.0|interesting storyline, altho slow in the beginning. build up and then sudden let down. you are left dangling at the end. if there is a sequel, i would not be interested.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I'm not going to attempt some in depth review of this movie's merits as I'd probably end up with a jumbled mess of a review so I'll just say that if you're a video game fan, especially one from the late 80's and on through the 90's you'll definitely dig this film. Same goes for people who are into Indie music and comics as well. The dialog is fast and snappy and there's plenty of witty humor and nods to classic video games like Zelda, Mario and Street Fighter. I'm not entirely sure why this movie did so poorly at the box office as it was extremely well reviewed and I'm not sure where the Michael Cera hate comes from as I thought he did a great job with the character. If you're not sure about picking this up, at least put it on your rental list. You'll be glad you did.    As far as tech specs for the Blu-ray, High-Def Digest said the colors didn't look as vibrant as in the theater but I'll be honest that I couldn't remember if that was the case or not as it looked great on my TV. The Audio definitely lives up to the high marks they gave it in their review and I was definitely pleased with the DTS Master Audio. There's a lot of bonus material here too which I haven't had a chance to go into and looks like several different commentary tracks for those who look forward to that. All in all a great Blu-ray and definitely one of my favorite movies!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album is so good it made me fall in love with new music and new bands again. I have it on heavy rotation on my ipod for the past three months and haven't got tired of it yet. I see I'm the 124th reviewer, not sure what I can add except PLEASE COME TOUR IN PHOENIX!! I'd love to see (and hear!) Mumford and Sons live.
0439023521|5.0|WOW, this book far exceeded my expectations-I was absolutely riveted!!<br />This book has stayed with me. I found myself haunted by the imagery, my dreams were saturated with the characters, and every conversation over the past few weeks have started with have you read the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Taking place in world that revolves around the ultimate reality television show- 24 enter, only one can be the victor, there is nothing light and fluffy about this book.<br />I found myself rooting for Katniss, and though her naivety started to get on my nerves, her genuine heart redeemed her in my eyes.<br /><br />Without wanting to spoil it for you, trust me when I say this is a page turner, and that it will leave you questioning our own society, and wondering how far we will go before we too will have Hunger Games....
0743298039|3.0|I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. It felt like a gothic fairy tale for adults. However, although I am not finished reading it, I find I am having difficulty following the story. The characters lose their authenticity as they continue a relationship devoid of relevance to the world outside of the story being told. Often times, I find I am reading dialogue with little understanding of where and how these characters are relating.
B000AYEL6U|3.0|I was disappointed that I didn't see more of the romance aspect of this story. I didn't read the book, but from all the reviews,  I was expecting more romance. I liked it well enough, but any prospective buyers should note that if you want to buy this because of the romance, you're better off getting something else perhaps.  This was a decent movie overall.
0671624342|5.0|As I stated in previous reviews, and due to a lack of anything that sounds appealing to my reading tastes of late, I've discovered the master storyteller, Jeffrey Archer.  Although \\"A Matter of Honor\\" is not the typical thriller that I'd read, with spy's and all that good stuff, Mr. Archer made this story an easy read, with a complex storyline that was fast paced, with great characters, that even an old girl like me could love.<br /><br />How in the world did I miss this outstanding author?  Highly recommended!!!
B002KSPKRS|1.0|Wow, talk about being disappointed.  I really wanted to like these.  Unfortunately, not only are they made of cheap plastic (I could overlook that) and the buttons/controls are cheesy (I could overlook that too) but the static and popping are just unbearable.  They sound pretty good when they work, but man, when they get to popping it's just maddening because there's no escape except to wait it out.  It's really annoying when it's coming in and out during gameplay (COD:BO), really frustrating.  Have to send them back...begrudgingly, but the last thing I need to do is try to troubleshoot wireless RF in my house, yeah, that sounds like fun.  Too bad they just don't work.
B00415MUWG|5.0|I listen to a lot of albums and this one really caught my attention. After hearing it for the first time I immediately played it again. During the next two weeks I played it about 7 or 8 more times. This is really really great music. First, it rocks with great crunching guitar riffs. But, what really does it for me is the great singing. Not much music these days feature male/female duets which is part of what captured my attention. But it's not just that, it's that it's so so good!
B00005RDRO|5.0|The puns in this movie are to die for! An all-star cast with great comedy timing.  It is very rare to come across a comedy like this these days.  And you can't beat the price.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I can't remember if I ever finished this book in high school. If I did, I didn't appreciate it as much as I did now - many, many years later :D    It's a lesson on good manners and right conduct, on faith, on family relationships, parenthood, sisterhood, brotherhood, friendship, neighborliness, courtship, marriage, child-rearing, dreams, frustrations , life itself - all found in the saga of the March sisters from when they were teeners and tweeners through their adulthood. I have highlighted quite a number of lines in this book that I would have shared if not for space limitation. The message is timeless - if we would all have the sense and character that was instilled in the March sisters; if all families were to see and act on its role as the most elemental unit in society(but the most important nonetheless), this world would be a better place for all of humankind.
0205313426|3.0|Leafing through this book I found the notes on use of the word \\"transpire\\". They are completely at odds with the definition in the New Oxford American Dictionary and the Random House Unabridged Dictionary to name just two. I have little respect, as the writers had for the readers, when they are writing a book on usage and don't even check established dictionaries. Surely there is useful information here but such careless errors throw the whole book into suspicion. In addition, the dictionary definitions correspond with how I have heard that word used my whole life and the definition in this book, while maybe occurring somewhere in literature, sounds completely wrong to me and I would be confused if I read such a statement in a book or article.

B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I bought this when I was in Iraq, I must have listened to it every day at the gym.  The good is the music, its probably the best music wise the band has ever done.  Vocal wise its ok...unlike Toxcity its less more outragious and thats a bad thing.  Its downright annoying.  Some songs are literally ruined by the vocals. Is almost like they aren't even trying.  The music and chorus' make up for the horrible vocals but because of this its really not a complete record in my opinion.  I remember listening to it at work and a co worker said.  This guy is the worst singer, this sucks.  Then later another said the same thing.  Its hard to enjoy music when the vocals get on your nerves.

1439152780|4.0|A letter written in 1941 finally reaches its destination in 1992. Its arrival throws the recipient, Meredith Burchill into tears. Meredith's daughter Edie embarks on a journey that leads her to the dark and decaying, perfectly gloomy, Milderhurst Castle in Kent where her mother was evacuated during the war.    In The Distant Hours, a story spanning two generations and fifty years, Kate Morton is at her best. She gently takes us from 1992 London to 1941 Kent. We meet the three elderly, eccentric Blythe sisters, and then Morton takes us back to 1941 where see them at Milderhurst as they were with their lives yet to be lived. We learn that Meredith was evacuated to the Milderhurst Castle as a young teen during the war and that the dark secrets she encountered there are still able to affect lives today.    As more mysteries are uncovered, Edie is further bewildered when she learns that the author of her favorite childhood book, The True History of the Mud Man, was written by Raymond Blythe, the father of the three sisters. There are so many questions to be answered and so many puzzles to be put together. There were so many lives torn apart. What happened at Milderhurst in the days of WW II, when children were evacuated to the countryside, when blackouts happened nightly and regular bombings rumbled building and took lives?    Kate Morton has again written a richly layered, well told saga of families and secrets. I love Morton's books and have to say that I think The Distant Hours is my new favorite. Bake up a batch of scones and brew a pot of Earl Grey and enjoy this haunting story.    If I gave stars, this one would get 4 1/2 out of 5.    Kate Morton, a native Australian, holds degrees in dramatic art and English literature and is currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Queensland. She lives with her family in Brisbane, Australia.    Source:  I received this in e-galley form from the publisher at my request and in no way did this affect my review.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I have read a lot of complaints that the pacific is too gory or too racist,or too much foul languange, well this was how it was. I was in the Marines in 1973-1979 and did not see any action, But that was how marines talked to each other back then and in boot camp I was hit a few times by drill instructors who didn't hold no punches.   It is easy to criticize sitting in a warm home and a cold beer about all the ecessive violence while in real life during the war it was much worst than was showned, such as the Bataan death march where beheadings were common, or pow's  being treated like dogs, or pow's on japanese ships being bombed by our own troops. Like I said war was hell.
B0018M6J90|5.0|I love this movie!  It is very uplifting as well as fun. The actors  each did a terrific job, the costumes and decor seemed perfect for  the period and it left me with a smile on my face.  It's the kind of movie I want to have on hand to lift my spirits when I'm having a bad day.
B003XMUFGQ|1.0|I love Eric Clapton's legacy of music he's created through the decades...well nearly all of it.  This album is yet another lazily thrown together pablum sampling from a man who is a genius.  Each time an album like this is issued by Eric I become more disappointed...but then I realize we're both in our sixties now and motivation and hard work are no longer at the top of our lists.    Still I long for quality again from \\"God\\"...a term I have always found very fitting to describe his abilities.  I've been seeing him play in concert as far back as The Yardbirds...through Cream, Derek and The Dominoes, Delaney Bonnie & Friends, Blind Faith and repeatedly as plain old wizard-of-guitar playing, Eric Clapton.    I'm okay listening to the great music he's recorded in various settings and various stars like B.B. King.  But just one more time (or maybe two) I would love to hear an album by him that took lots of thought and effort.  I'm sure he can still do it...but at our age, motivation is something that becomes more difficult each day...obviously for Eric too.
B0043JEA14|5.0|After seeing the Doobie Brothers perform at Bluesville in Tunica recently, I decided to download the album from Amazon and glad I did.  The writer that said Pat and Tom's voices are shot should have his hearing checked.  If anything, their voices sound stronger than ever.  No stinkers on this great new album. As far as seeing them live, the Doobies just blew everybody away.  If they are playing close to where you live, by all means go see them and buy the album or download it from Amazon.  You won't be disappointed!

B003EYVXSW|1.0|This movie had an interesting premise. A creature created by manipulating genes and who appears to be invincible and extremely adaptive. We can forgive standard violence we've come to expect and the questions of morality that have been discarded.  We can even forgive questionable science.    But somewhere this movie leaps into the absurd and disgusting. I feel the need to warn you before you get caught off guard as I did. I mentioned that I wanted to see this movie to several people who had seen the movie previously and I would have appreciated a warning.     SPOILER...the Thing seduces its father (not biological) and rapes its genetic mother....YUCK! and the mother gets pregnant! Really, it went there!!!!    It's like some extremist individual's argument against genetic engineering and research. It's going to kill our men and rape our women.    Good luck! This movie left me with a bad impression I wish I could erase from my memory. I do NOT recommend it.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I have enjoyed SITC in the past, but the only review for this movie was \\"It was all over the Place\\". The closing scene with Samantha was truly weird and the Gay Wedding was so long and drawn out. I think the Gay wedding was a take off from Mel Brook's Blazing Saddles scene at the end of the movie and would have been better if the brutes had shown up and there had been a brawl! I thought the movie was just plain bad. Two Thumbs Down!!

As much as I love Ken Follett's books and acclaim him as a grand story teller. I will not pay this price.

B002KSPKRS|1.0|Connection and setup is easy enough, power from the USB port of an Xbox360, and audio via the included optical cable.    However there was excessive popping, hiss, and loss of audio when using them.  Certainly not acceptable for a product of this price, and definitely not acceptable when they sell the RF as an improvement over their prior IR communication.  I tried moving the base unit as far away from my LCD and other wireless devices as the cables would allow, and also removed the Xbox360 talk back cable entirely to eliminate any chance of it causing the issues, and there was still lots of hiss and popping.    The drivers themselves in the headphones seem capable of delivering good audio, but delivering the signal to the headphones needs to be seriously reworked.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|I've got the 2 cd version of this title...the one with the second disc full of demos etc. The original album has a magnificent sound quality and mix. When I was looking to buy this album, the reason I swung towards this particular version of the album was that it had an extended version of \\"Sara\\". Single cd versions of this album usually have the radio edit of this song. It would have been great to have that radio edit on the second cd. Anyway, this album brings up Fleetwood Mac's hat-trick of great consecutive albums...starting off with their second self-titled release, followed by Rumours. All these albums score 9.5 to 10 out of 10 for me. Tusk has a combination of rock, country rock and easy-listening music on it. A highlight of the album is Lindsey Buckingham's lead guitar note picking throughout...\\"Sara\\" would be a great example of that trait. This album has two of - if not my top two - favourite Fleetwood Mac songs...\\"Tusk\\" and \\"Sara\\". Whilst not having more 'killer' tracks like that on this album, it is nonetheless a pleasure to listen to. Original album has a run time of 74:22 minutes, which doesn't drag, as some albums can do...like \\"Trout mask replica\\" or even \\"The Beatles\\".      The Classics \\"/\\" (big ticks):      Tusk - the last I heard, this was Fleetwood Mac's only top 10 hit in Australia. It's my favourite Fleetwood Mac song. It has an all time great drum rhythm from Mick Fleetwood (very tribal bong rhythm happening). Mick has a solo in this track too, where he lets loose for a little bit. Drums may be overdubbed too...or maybe another drummer complements Mick. Cool elements to the song include the lead guitar and the brass section with its terrific riff. You get some down low brass too, with a tuba. The guitar has a Led Zeppelin feel to it sometimes as well. Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks share the lead vocal duties.    Sara - intro especially has lovely, delicate dual lead guitar notes. Maybe there's a piano in there too. Stevie Nicks sings. Mick utilises nice sounding brush strokes for his percussion. This version is about a third longer than the radio edit.       Then...\\"/\\" (small tick)    I know I'm not wrong -  a jaunty song. Has the accordion, I think. I like the simple and interesting drum rhythm...maybe it's a foretaste of \\"Tusk\\"? Lindsey sings and has backing vocal and harmonising accompaniment. There is a dual guitar set up.     Then...\\".\\"    Over and over - slow, gentle song. Sensual vocals by Christine. Stevie provides provides some of the backing vocals. Song has a country flavour to it...e.g. with the electric lead guitar coming out of the left hand side of the speakers. Nice dampened acoustic guitar sounds coming out of the right hand side.    That's all for everyone - I think that I bumped this song up from a \\"(.)\\" to a \\".\\". Interesting track...has steel string guitar strums and a percussion instrument like a glockenspiel or something. Lindsey sings and has backing vocals. The main vocal and backing vocal rhythm is dreamy. I've got a note querying the lyrics in the backing vocals...not sure if the word \\"sexy\\" is mentioned.    Storms - This song got bumped to this ranking on second listen...took a couple of listens to like more in any case. Pleasant track with dual electric guitar notes, bass, keyboard and a percussion instrument like a xylophone or something. Stevie sings and has soothing backing vocal accompaniment. My notes mention that at least in the bonus disc, this song mentions Sara.       Then...\\"(.)\\"      Brown eyes - laid back groove, with jazzy cymbal percussion. Nice bass. The keyboard is too, at times. It does sound familiar though...can't pin it down though. A couple of the keyboard's melodies are interesting though. Christine's vocals are soothing, I think. She has backing vocals. You hear an electric guitar at the end.    Never make me cry - soothing sounds as far as the music and Christine's vocals go. Quiet guitar and organ. Cymbals and strumming on the electric guitar.    Honey hi - another pleasant Christine McVie song. Has acoustic guitar, pleasant bongos, keyboard, and backing vocals with nice harmonies.      The rest (in chronological order):      The ledge - a jaunty song with strong bass guitar notes. Lindsey sings with backing vocals from Stevie. Guitar sounds Led Zeppelin-ish later (the first instance of this trait on the album, of three). A jolly track with a real sing-along mood to it.    Think about me - mid-tempo rock. Christine sings then Lindsey picks it up. Their vocals harmonise at times, when they both take the lead. Backing vocals at times too. Keyboard features. A little country sounding song?    Save me a place - gentle song with strong/interesting percussion (as far as the tone goes). Lindsey sings and has backing vocal accompaniment. You get some harmonising too. Maybe you hear a ukelele, or at least the guitar sounds like a miniature or something is being used.    What makes you think you're the one? - sounds like Mick is taking a baseball bat to his drum-kit! Piano is percussive too. Also has bass and synth. Either a violin is used or the guitar is somehow made to sound something like that (I'm guessing). Lindsey sings.     Not that funny - jaunty rock song. Big beat. Lindsey sings. One guitar has a bit of a \\"Nutbush city limits\\" vibe to it. Other guitar sounds highly strung.    Sisters of the moon - steel string guitar, bass. Stevie sings...she has mystical lyrics again, perhaps. Multiple guitars. A touch of \\"Rhiannon\\" to this song. Brass later. Also a touch of \\"Gold\\" to this song (Wikipedia attributes that song to John Stewart...but Google also has a hit to the lyrics of this song for Stevie Nicks...she must have covered it at some point too). My note for the bonus cd version of this song mentions that the bass keyboard part for it reminds me of a melody on MGMT's debut album \\"Oracular spectacular\\"...so maybe they mined it from here?    Angel - keyboard intro sort of \\"Joy to the world\\" (byThree Dog Night. Just btb, the name of that band apparently has an Australian connection...I'm not sure how authentic that connection is in any case!). Soft country rock guitar with boogie bass. Stevie sings and has vocal back-up. I've got a note querying \\"song\\"...Googling the lyrics, there is a line in there about \\"a haunted song\\". Which? Any?    That's enough for me - has another instance of that Led Zeppelin type of fuzz guitar tone...or maybe it's a synthesiser effect. One guitar also has a banjo effect going on. Lindsey sings...raucously at times. I've got a note for the bonus disc version of this song...totally btb, but there is a vocal sound \\"ho ya\\" (?) which brought to mind that sound as used by Al Pacino in the movie \\"Scent of a woman\\".    Beautiful child - pleasant Stevie Nicks song with backing vocals, bass, acoustic guita and piano. The latter plays a familiar, simple melody...wonder if it has been 'borrowed' by other acts since. Song has harmonising on it too.    Walk a thin line - pleasant Lindsey Buckingham song with backing vocals. Has some strong drumming though. Delicate acoustic guitar...the bass line from \\"You've lost that loving feeling\\" gets a run on it too. There is a nice guitar melody later on...maybe on the keyboard too...not sure, maybe what sounds like a keyboard is the guitar still? More harmonised singing.    Never forget - country flavoured lead guitar, woody percussion. A pipe sounding instrument features as well. Christine sings and has backing vocal accompaniment and harmonising too. Steel string acoustic guitar, bass and keyboard feature too.       The bonus cd (selected notes):      Judging from this, Fleetwood Mac's demo tapes sound better than most other bands' studio recordings! Some songs aren't obviously different to that on the original album. Some songs - like \\"Sara - have different instruments carrying the melodies. E.g. here the piano, not the guitar carries the tune. They obviously knew what they were doing when they chose to go with the guitar for the album version! Some songs here are instrumentals.      Farmer's daughter - interesting guitar sound...has wobbly strums. Pleasant song. Bassy, re guitar notes...reminds me of Sid Snot's theme in The Kenny Everett Video Show (the theme pre-dated this show though).     Kiss and run - campfire sing-along vibe.    Sisters of the moon - has unintentional distortion, which is surprising. This just occurs in one passage though.      Recommendations:      Fleetwood Mac - Fleetwood Mac. Another classic. 95/100.    Fleetwood Mac - Rumours. Their monster hit. 5/5    The Velvet Underground - The Velvet Underground & Nico. Easy listening but with edgy lyrics. 9.5/10    The Velvet Underground - The Velvet Underground. 5/5
B00377V6J2|5.0|I don't think there is any disagreement out there that this is a fantastic CD. Not only is the music great, but it's also entertaining how King takes the reins on the whole session and acts as the \\"fatherly figure\\", dishing out advice to his then-young and up-and-coming disciple SRV. It's amusing how on several instances Stevie starts to solo, then seems to pause, as if he's trying not to upstage King, only for King to belt out \\"GO AHEAD!\\", thereby giving him permission to \\"turn up the heat\\"--classic! King's band is in fine form backing up the two stars, and everyone REALLY gets into it and gives it their all during \\"Blues at Sunrise\\", the centerpiece of the session!<br /><br />Some of the MUSIC on the DVD, by contrast, isn't quite as captivating as on the CD. It's still good, but some of the best parts were not included on the DVD, most regrettably \\"Blues at Sunrise\\". I would pay another $15 to see the video of that tune alone! The DVD is undoubtedly a wonderful addition to this re-release--don't get me wrong--it's great to be able to SEE just what went down on that momentous day! And both the sound and picture are crisp and clear! However, I'm unsure what the plan was for the DVD, so to speak. I would have thought that it would have either EVERYTHING from the session or just what wasn't on the CD. As it turns out, it's a mixture. There is overlap AND missing songs on the DVD. That's kind of a puzzler, and again, a bummer in that \\"Blues at Sunrise\\" was not included. To be honest, some of the slow blues jams on the DVD were a tad bit long. I still enjoyed it, but I got the impression that whatever material not deemed worthy of the CD release was dumped on the DVD.<br /><br />Overall, though, a GREAT re-release of this classic album. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, whether or not you have the original CD from 1999!!
0393327345|5.0|This book is a great read whether or not you have seen the movie. It is very fast paced and clearly written. The style and narration is very unique and thought provoking. I am a huge fan of the movie and while the movie stays true to the book, there are enough interesting differences to make watching the movie and reading the book both well worth the effort.
0739344269|5.0|I bought the book for my husband but we have both been enjoying it.  It's not too difficult to understand and we are both getting alot from it.
B002RO76Y0|2.0|This maybe the Doors band but it is definitely not the doors sorry but they just don,t have the doors sound with out Jim Morrison they are incomplete he is the Man.
1401324029|4.0|It arrive in beautiful condition.  It is to be a Christmas gift.  My daughter in lawloved the 1st Nikki Heat book and has said she wants the second one.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Amazing voice and album!<br />\\"The Lazy Song\\" is a favorite of mine, but so many others are really energy inducers. \\"Count On Me\\" is similar to Jack Johnson's style, but more jazzed up.<br /><br />$5 for the whole album? Are you kidding me?
0634060384|4.0|Great Book!!!  It has great standards, easy to use and well indexed.  I am having so much fun. A great exchange for the price.  I wish they had words for the lyrics but that would make the book thicker.
B003HTPHSQ|3.0|I love Cyndi Lauper and I love the blues so....thought this would be a good fit. I saw her do one of the songs off her new cd on a tv show and I liked it and wanted to hear more so I was surprised and dissappointed when I got it and listened and it wasnt nearly as good as I had hoped. I still love her but maybe this isnt her thing.
0547328567|5.0|My daughter received this book for her 1st birthday. It teaches pairs of words in context, is fun and has great illustrations. We read it every night before bed. Now nearly two, she knows all the words and uses them in everyday life in the correct context. Just another fantastic book from Mem Fox. Thanks!
B001LRJH0U|4.0|Arrive in great condition.  Its a great movie.  I plan to added to the book as a Christmas gift for my oldest son.  I'm a fan of westerns and the late Robert B. Parker.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I was so happy when I walked out of INCEPTION that I finally saw a movie that was worth the price of admission.    First, this is not a go to the bathroom movie. It's a stay in your seat and pay attention the whole time movie.   It's not that it's really hard to follow, as long as you're paying attention you'll follow along just fine.    You probably already know the concept.   Leo's Character (Cobb) runs a small group of people who are paid to enter the dreams of others and extract info from their brains, corporate espionage.  Cobb has been unable to return to America and to his family because of a crime he was accused of years ago. His goal over the last couple of years is to find a way to return to his family in the states.      Cobb meets very powerful Asian businessman who promises Cobb his kids and family back if he can perform whats thought to be an impossible quest, to IMPLANT an idea into one of the Asian business mans competitors, INCEPTION.    if he can do it, he will be allowed to return to America and to his family.    The Film is beautifully shot, and mixes the emotional journey Cobb is going through with the sci-fi well. I was really attached to the characters, and really was attached to Cobbs wife, that entire storyline I found to have the most impact overall.    Ultimately this is a movie where if you hear someone give it one start, to never ever take their movie advice.    the stakes are incredibly high, it's not save the world from aliens or computers high, more like save yourself from yourself high, save yourself from an eternity of a living nightmare, lost in your own mind, and all the emotional torture your mind can create.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|straight out of the box, it will take hairs off of your arm. Pretty good for something that is as thick as a pry bar. This knife is the most solid I have ever owned. It's a steal!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady Gaga is a phenomenal performer. This CD is at the Top of the charts. This is on my CD player everyday & blasting the music. Get on board with LADY GAGA
0312600844|1.0|That book was one of worst things I have ever read! I kept hoping it would get better! I sincerely cannot believe that it has garnered so much praise.  The characters were flat,charmless and unbelievable. I only stayed with it because I bought it. Toward the end I was skimming. I shudder when I think that he is speaking with a knowing voice and addressing current concerns. I just finished reading all the Rabbit books by Updike. No comparison to him or Cheever.  I felt much better after I read the review in the Atlantic. That reviewer hit all the right notes.    Don't waste your money!!  One can only hope it will never be a movie!!
B0039TD7RC|5.0|This is one of The \\"Stones\\", Best albums,but lets be truthful. Once Mick Taylor left the Band,They have never been the same. If you think of all of the Great Guitar LEADS in every one of the Rolling Stone's song's from 1969 to 1974 it has ALWAYS been Mick Taylor. Once He left the band.They gave up the Title,\\"World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\\". \\"Exile\\",DOES take some time to get into,but you MUST give it time. See the conditions how They made the music for this album,you will appreciate it a little more. I am a Long Time ,\\"Stones\\" Fan.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I got this on DVD not too long after it was released, and it was worth every penny. I had been introduced to rush about a year and a half before (Some of the best music I have ever heard, and I now own every studio album except Feedback) but I knew little of their story. granted, on searches for the lyrics and meanings behind their songs on the internet, I picked up some of the story, bit it's nothing compared to what's in the documentary.     There's a little bit of everything in here, and most of it's actually rather funny, while other parts are rather heartbreaking (The Ghostrider era, for instance) but in the end, it tells the story of three genuine intelligent human beings, quite unlike any other band. Music has made great strides with rush's influence, and with out them, there would be no Dream Theater, Queensryche and other notable prog rock/metal bands.     This documentary even turned my father over to liking Rush, and this is a man who never cared for my musical tastes up to that point. He never actually intended to watch the movie all the way through, and yet 10 minutes into it, he was taking it all in and enjoying it. Afterwords, he asked me for a bunch of my Rush CDs to borrow.     So, I cannot guarantee you will like Rush after watching this (though it is quite likely), but they WILL have your respect.     Watch this documentary. Highly recommended.
0802473156|5.0|If you ask me, \\"Is this book cliched?\\"  I would say, YES.  It is, it has really corny things in it.  However, that does not change the fact that there are some really important things in this book.  My fiance and I read this before we were married.  It helped us understand what makes us happy, and what the other one can do to make sure our emotional needs are met.  I am really happy I read this book.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|The Doctor of the Fifth Series is \\"different\\" in a good way, and the stories (what I saw of them... KEEP READING!!!) range from \\"very good\\" to \\"excellent\\" (two were SO good I cried). Dr. Who purists (yes, you KNOW who you are... and I know I shan't change your minds with this review) will whine about how not-like-the-last-one Matt Smith is. I've been watching Dr. Who since the early 70s, and I think the steady improvement in the quality of the writers & scripts, the special effects & cinematography, and the actors & acting more than make up for the occasional misstep when casting a new Doctor. Though a bit \\"green\\" in his first episode as Doctor, Matt S. will grow on you, with time and a little patience on your part. He's energetic and able to be quirky enough to be most fans' new Doctor (just not that of all the purists). That said... I give four stars for content.     BUT... ONE lousy star for inferior packaging and bone-headed mistakes on the assembly line, BBC! When I finally got to Disk 5, I popped it into the player and sat back to enjoy the last three episodes of the season. NO SUCH LUCK! It was Disk 6. In fact, I had TWO bleedin' Disk 6s!!!!  Also noticed that when I laid open the fan-fold disk holders they became disconnected from the cardboard folder-thingy. Turns out they're attached to the folder with inferior adhesive. Not a big deal for me: I always repackage DVD sets in more compact jewel cases with new custom labels, but the flimsy package is still disappointing, given the price.    If you get one of these squib DVDs, Amazon will gladly exchange it for a new product (hopefully with ALL the disks, as advertised) or refund your money. Hooray for Amazon... thumbs down for the BBC Factory Foul-up Team! BTW: I opted for a replacement... I haven't seen the last three episodes yet... B-(
0439023521|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing book that will leave you hungering for more.  Unfortunately, it seems it won't make it past being a trilogy... so you'll be hungry for a while.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book may be the best thriller novel I've ever read.  The characters were complex and believable, and the storyline mostly kept me guessing.  So refreshing to read this kind of book absent the usual formulas.  Not much more I can say without spoiling the plot or the ending.  But, after having just finished this book, I'm already excited to buy the other two.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|What is it about sitting in on other people's therapy sessions that is so entirely compelling? Vouyerism, I suppose. There are five clients - six if you count the therapist - each with awful problems of the most satisfyingly grusome type. I couldn't stop watching and I couldn't stop crying for a lot of it. Sad though most of it was, and recognising most of us don't need to gratuitously add sadness to our lives, the show offers something that feels remarkably like human wisdom, making it extremely worth the emotional investment.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I am not going to retread what tons of other people wrote here. If you like intelligent, well-acted, thought-provoking, kind-of-somewhat but not-really-accurate \\"Historical Epics\\", then Rome is the best series of its kind in television's history. True, \\"I, Claudius\\" offers a better script, but the production is light-years apart, and Rome's sheer breadth and attention to detail trump \\"I, Claudius\\" as the one Roman series to rule them all.<br /><br />In Blu-ray, which is the only way to get everything out of this series, you will feel a true part of Rome. The acting is exceptional all around. It's not fair to single out one great actor amongst a true ensemble cast. The story is well-known to most, the \\"Dawn of the Empire\\". The same 25 years of Roman History that manages to miss the other 1000 years like almost every other Roman-themed series of late.<br /><br />I recommend that if you do \\"Rome\\", do it the right way the FIRST time, or you will be spending more money later on. Nab a Blu-ray version on sale. It's worth every penny over the DVD, and the transfer and mastering are outstanding. So, suck it up and spend a couple extra bucks now. You will never make it through from Netflix or Video On Demand. Plus, a series this great will be watched multiple times. Look at it like a Gift from Jupiter.<br /><br />Like any good Roman, beg, borrow, steal or kill to own this. (Just kidding about the begging part).<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0028RXXFC Rome: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]]]
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I really enjoy the series \\"Bones\\" and have been trying to keep up with it.  Sometimes when there is nothing else on TV I go to my extended movie library and pick out something to watch Bones is one that I often choose. I picked it out at Amazon because I was able to get it as soon as it came out and didn't have to go to the store.
0140120416|5.0|I purchased this book for my son who is studing Russian, Russian bible to be precise.  He loved it.  He said it was much better than he had expected.  It has really helped him in learning.
B000002UZ1|4.0|I ordered the 1967-1970 The Blue Album. The service was very good and I would  order again from this company. The only complaint I have is the case was broken  and I have to find a new cover for it.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|You know how, sometimes, you buy a cd based on liking one song, and hope the rest of the disk is ok?  I guess in today's technology, with individual song downloads so readily available, that isn't so much the case any more, but, I'm old fashioned that way.  This is the best cd I've heard in a long while, pretty much since 'Walking In Memphis'.  Almost every song is a foot tapping, sing along song.  Maybe not something for the ages, but very, very enjoyable.
B002ZG980U|1.0|We were so looking forward to seeing this movie after reading great reviews about a \\"mind-bender\\" but spent an hour waiting for it to get better, gain some clarity, or just plan make sense! In the end we just turned it off and went to bed!
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|I think you need to have seen the first two seasons to properly appreciate Chuck. The third season has slightly more complex plots which makes it more entertaining. I don't think it would work properly without Morgan, Jeff and Lester. Casey is a Clint Eastwood character that can do comedy.     Great fun. I recommend it to everyone. Often.
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|Having seen and enjoyed Gran Torino in the theatres, and then purchasing the dvd, I was looking forward to Clint Eastwood's work in Hereafter.         As I was watching Hereafter, I allowed myself to get lost in the film, especially the scenes involving the fatherless twin boys, one of them  played by Frankie McLaren (Marcus), who did a great job.  These scenes involving the two boys and their mother, who was a alcoholic/drug  addict, were very heart wrenching, and at the same time very loving.  I could not help but feel for both the kids and their Mom who was so sick.      I will not go on with an entire outline, so I will fast forward towards the end of the film, when  Matt Damon's character, the reluctant psychic, finally meets with the 12 year old boy Marcus, who has just lost his twin brother in an accident,  was taken away from his mother, and is now  in a foster home.  So, you got the idea of what this kid is dealing with? Ok.    After Damon's character gives Marcus his reading, he tells him that his brother from the great beyond said \\"he is him and I am you, and we are one\\" ( I guess this is some New Age Hollywood mantra for:  Forget God).  Then he tells him that Marcus is now on his own.   What a message to tell a 12 year old.   Especially a 12 year old who has just been devastated by recent family tragedies.  HE'S ON HIS OWN!!!??    What I was so angry and upset about was how this poor kid's character was given no hope for the awful pain he was enduring.  Of course, at the very end of the film, all the main characters had the very mere mortal, cheesy, happy ending.  Please.    But nowhere in the film did Clint Eastwood, or the screenwriter Peter Morgan, ever acknowledge the Creator of the hereafter.  Nowhere in the film did I ever see any indication that God was in charge, or how Christ's Resurrection  plays a part in how most people in Western society view the afterlife.  Oh, there was the one scene where Marcus goes on line to view a Muslim man talking about death, and  Marcus ignores him, and then views another man talking about how knowing Christ would be helpful to understanding the afterlife, but this was shot down as well.      Look, to me it's very simple, unless people demand that the One, Living,  Loving God and His Holy Spirit be brought into Hollywood films more often, we will still receive the same results (like in the Hereafter) over and over again.  Hopefully, some big producers will allow some more writers and directors ( like they did with Secretariat, and The Blind Side) to let God's Love  shine more often.  There are millions of Americans who would pay good money (including me) to see more films like the two aforementioned.  Hey Hollywood, even our currency says \\"In God we trust.\\" :)    Thank you for reading my review.
B0043GAZYS|1.0|Except for the expensive CGA work, this seems like the production of a Canadian undergrad film school student.  I truly found it silly and a waste of time, but if you are under 18 and jonesing for an underage Chinese chick, maybe you will get it.  I didn't care how it ended or who was left after \\"game over\\".

B002RKSZKI|3.0|It appears to be full of errors, blank pages and missing text. I tried deleting the file and reloading it, but it didn't fix the problem. Is there something wrong with my Kindle or your books?
0316067598|4.0|Fantastic narrative that gives an inside look at the upper echelon of our fighting forces. Some may think the book drags at parts, but when looking at the whole, it is simply setting up future events. I tore through this book in about a week, and found myself looking forward to getting home from work to dive back into this book.
0441018866|5.0|Having read many of Reynold's novels this one is by far my favorite.  This book has big ideas and an interesting story set across huge expanses of time and space but unlike some of Reynold's other novels it also has a very satisfying ending.  Self contained story... a great place to start if you are interested in reading some of Reynold's work.
B0040T7B2W|5.0|Great album. Killer first track, got a little spacey in the middle end of the album, but enjoy it immensely.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Unsure about this novel to begin with, I found it to be a &#34;can't put it down, read in one sitting, page-turner&#34;  from the first sentence.  A very unique and well crafted story that has you cheering for its two main characters, Jack and his Ma.  Makes you grateful for all the everyday things we tend to take for granted. How much and whom do we need in our lives to grow?
B003EV6DBM|5.0|The budget for this latest season seems to have exploded (upwards). The cinematography is stunning. This is, in my opinion, the best season as a whole, since we cannot rate the episodes individually. (The main writer of this season also wrote my 2 favorite episodes from past seasons: Girl in the Fireplace and Silence in the Library.)<br /><br />I am a huge Tom Baker fan. Second favorite is David Tennant. Matt Smith is at least third, and in contention for first, though my nostalgia will probably not allow that.<br /><br />Reading the negative reviews here, I am thinking there is a lot of nostalgic thinking going on. One of the fun things about being a fan has always been complaining and laughing about the budget or improbable this or that. So keep that in mind if you are reading these reviews in making your decision to buy or not. A lot of the negative reviews complain about the science in this season as being unrealistic. Really? Are you going to go there? The science has always been ridiculous and remains so. Why do you think that the Science Fiction and the Fantasy sections at the bookstore are usually the same section?<br /><br />Perhaps on some level this new series does place spirituality upon a higher pedestal than science, but this series is fiction and is supposed to evoke emotion, not teach physics. Doctor Who is a hero we watch because he is Good, not because he understands scientific theories.<br /><br />Very moving stories, especially loved the Vincent van Gogh one. I can't wait for more.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The biggest thing I loved, was the normalcy the characters possessed. Most gay films show flaming homosexuals and involve drugs, disease, violence and other tragedies. This film depicted one character who struggled with his sexuality, family and following his dreams. His life wasn't easy by any means and he made major sacrifices for his family. The struggles the characters encountered were very real and relevant. This is truly one of my favorite, if not the favorite, move I own. I laughed and cried and I am so glad I made the purchase. If you are GLBT this is a must see. Even if you are gay-friendly, you will enjoy this story.
B003YNFYD8|3.0|Although there is no question of the high quality meterial on this set unfortunally the brains behind this release is attemting to take Beatle fans for a ride once again. How many times do we need to have these type of compilations to appear  without getting bogged down with the same music over and over? Just because a little reverb is added here or thumpier bass lines are added there does'nt really make a big diffrence when it comes to the already near perfect music of the fab four. Sure this release brings back memories for those people who grew up in my generation (those who learned about the beatles music through such compilations as these during the seventies) but after the big roll out of the beatles re-releases of about a year ago i thought that would have been it. I rather keep the original releases the way they were warts and all, no need for clever producers and engineers to promote their lattest gimmicks in recorded sound using the great music of the beatles to sell it. Remember those songs became legend during the analog age on scrathy records and hiss filled tapes, who cares if Lennon's voice sound clearer or not now? after all these years i sure don't because nine out of ten times it's still  gonna be a great sounding song. To sum it up if you already have this collection in some form (especially in it's original two record set) pass on this release, it's a waste of time unless you're a die hard beatle who just has to have everything or a sound scholar of some sort.
0312933541|5.0|A fantastic page turner, which got me hooked on Jeffrey Archer.    Although a few of his later books followed a similar formula (down and out person starts business, and though both luck and perseverence rises to the top), this book was refreshingly unique.
B004132HZS|5.0|When I saw this 3-parter on TV a few weeks ago, I instantly thought about the 5th season of Doctor Who (2010). Today I did some research and found out it does in fact have the same writer. So maybe Steven Moffat has found himself a formula, but it is a good one.<br /><br />If you know Doctor Who, then you can see the similarities. A quirky male hero who knows more than just about anyone he meets.<br /><br />The series is creative in its use of notes to the audience such as typed text-messages floating across the screen, rather than the old-fashioned 3-second close-up of a handwritten letter with elegant penmanship. Updated but fun. I am guessing they will add a few signature eccentricities to Holmes if the series takes off.<br /><br />Contemporary, smart, and a bit edgy. You can't guess the mystery outcomes but have you ever been able to?<br /><br />I was very happy that when he played the violin, he actually played it. I can't stand fake violin playing onscreen! If you remember what he played, you should laugh at this comment.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next season. I want more than 3 episodes this time!
B004132I20|5.0|I've always been a Sherlock Holmes fan, so this show didn't have to work too hard to win me over.<br /><br />The acting is really good and the stories are great until the end.  I'm not too thrilled with what Sherlock did at the end of episode 1 but that's just a personal opinion.<br /><br />Definitely not a waste of time by any means.  I think this show sets the standard for all crime related TV shows.
0525423842|5.0|As usual, John Grishman has given us a great story.  This one is a real \\"feel good\\" story that even younger readers will enjoy.  That is not to say it that adults will find it too simple.  A page turner for sure.

0547258305|5.0|Imagine living in a world where if your eyes are off-colored, you possess a special talent known as a grace. These talents could be swimming and knitting, but for Katsa, they may be more extreme such as combat and killing.     Katsa is of the royal family, and being born with a blue and green eye, she is treated just like any other graceling--different. So when a prince comes to the land searching for a lost treasure and evidence of strange tales, Katsa can't help but feel this is her time to change her plans. Leaving all that she knows, she and her new friend embark on a fantastic journey that not even they know how it will end.    At some point in anyone's life, they feel the need to spread their wings and try to find answers. When I read this book, I felt so much for Katsa's losses and triumphs I found myself lost in the pages unable to escape until I knew what happened next. If you like excitement and faint romance, adventure and mystery, this book has it all. Anyone can enjoy this book, and anyone will find themselves wanting more in the end.
B003FSTN5C|1.0|NCIS is one of the worst TV shows I have seen. It is incredible fool. LL Cool J is not an actor. He looks so stupid playing the tough guy... As Hety, Linda Hunt looks awful.

0805092447|5.0|This is a very simple book. The first time I read it with my about to turn 5yr old I didn't get the raves. She's just learning to read and by the end of the day she was \\"reading\\" this book to me by herself. I know it was the repetition of the sentences and the pictures that enabled her to read this book in such a short period of time. But she was very proud of herself and I saw that she was looking at the words as she read.<br /><br />Thanks to the person who recommended this version of the book, the pictures match the words on the page, over the more reviewed one that amazon also sells. This is very helpful for an early reader.
030758660X|3.0|I was looking forward to getting this book.  When I got it I did like some of the patterns at first glance.  Upon closer inspection I saw that there was an entire section of the book that was repeated and another entire section that was missing completely.  There were about 20 pages missing so I returned the book.  Since I had no way of knowing if the replacement book would be okay or have the same problem I did not reorder it.  I gave it 3 stars because the patterns were nice and some of them were things that I might actually have made.  If the book hadn't been defective I would have rated it higher.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I have Band of Brothers and The pacific is diffrent format, much more family life which I like.  I served in WW2 in the invasion of Normany and then in the Pacific, not as a Marine but as a sailor on a destroyer.
630522577X|2.0|In Edwardian London, phonetics Professor Henry Higgins and his friend, Colonel Pickering, make a bet about whether Higgins can train Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower seller from the slums, in speech and manners so that she can be passed off as a duchess at an embassy ball.    I grew up listening to the Broadway cast album, and my father hummed \\"With a Little Bit of Luck\\" to the day he died. I wanted to get a better sense of this show, which obviously meant so much to an earlier generation. My first viewing of the film, which I know well is a beloved classic left me cold, so I watched a second time, figuring I could either change my mind or think more about why I felt so cold.    There are things I really enjoyed about this movie.     The first is Audrey Hepburn's performance as Eliza Doolittle. Yes, I am aware of the controversy over her being cast instead of Julie Andrews. Jack Warner was putting a fortune into this movie and wanted Hepburn, who had never made a flop, to star, rather than Andrews, who had never made a movie. Hepburn was nowhere near the singer Andrews was, but she was an accomplished film actress whose persona was well-suited to the part of Eliza. She conveys Eliza's emotions with skill and subtlety. The 1994 DVD contains tracks of Hepburn's singing so you can compare it to Marni Nixon's dubbed vocals. I prefer Hepburn myself, because the singing voice matches the speaking voice, and why a Cockney slum girl would have a trained multi-octave coloratura soprano is beyond me. I would have preferred it if they'd dropped \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\" (really more a showcase for Andrews' voice rather than integral to the story) and re-worked the remaining songs to suit Hepburn's more limited but perfectly acceptable abilities.     The second was the production design. Cecil Beaton's sets and costumes, especially the surreal Ascot Gavotte, are fascinating in the restored 1994 DVD.     Now for what I didn't like:    The movie was so obviously filmed ona back lot and on sound stages. It would have been nice for them to at least shoot some exteriors on location.     Neither Rex Harrison (Professor Higgins) nor Stanley Holloway (Eliza's father) appear to have toned down their stage performances for the film. Their relentless mugging, probably perfectly fine for trying to reach the nosebleeds seats in live theater, is irritating on film.      The filmmakers took little advantage of the medium to \\"open out\\" the show. It has very much the static look of a filmed play. Director George Cukor's quiet camerawork does little to enliven things.     Andre Preven's orchestrations are quite saccharine.     Most of the musical numbers drag on far too long with endless choruses and repetitions. Many of the dialogue scenes drag too, or maybe I was just tired after the songs going on forever. Overall there is a bloated feeling, as is so often the case with musicals made when the format was starting to die out in the late 1950s and early 1960s.     There was little in the way of choreography. My personal taste runs to more emphasis on dance in musical films.     Other than \\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly,\\" the songs don't resonate for me, though I know that's not a common opinion.     It's such a well-known film that I'm glad I saw it for myself, but I wouldn't buy it to watch over and over.

1930485182|4.0|I suffered from severe menstrual cramps, and this book is definitely helpful as an adjunct therapy.  The first half describes how to do each pose, the benefits of the pose, pictures of the pose and modifications, as well as English and Sanskrit names.  The second half of the book has a section on breathing (pranayama) and the different types of techniques.  However, Breath of Fire isn't included here, as this isn't Kundalini Yoga.  The following sections focus on yoga sequences to do prior to menstruation, during menstruation, and after.  The Restorative poses such as Supta Baddha Konasana are really effective.  I like how she gives complete sequences with arrows showing the exact order of the poses for each issue, such as nervous tension.  The author provides a lot of text explaining the benefits of the poses in relation to women's health.  She also explains how each sequence aids women in each particular phase.  Chapters are set up very well, and the book is well organized.  Chapter 2 is quite interesting, as it           focuses on Menarche to Menopause in terms of history, culture, health, and biology.  Really cool information here.  This is Iyengar yoga organized into sequences for each phase of the menstrual cycle and its attendant symptoms.   A lot of good information is here.  There isn't a chapter of poses for menopause, but these are still good poses for a general yoga practice. I have tried everything for my cramps, but birth control pills just have too many side effects.  I changed my diet and cut out junk meats, beef, and pork.  I have increased my magnesium, calcium, vitamin D3,vitamin E, and B vitamins.  When my period is approaching I cut the sugar, caffeine, beef, and poultry to reduce prostaglandins, which cause pain.  Per Ayurveda medicine, I do as little as possible on the first day of bleeding.  I use this book to guide my yoga practice, and my pain has decreased A LOT.  Western women need to slow down, rest, modify their diet, and stop acting like menstruation that you ignore.  For someone who couldn't even walk aross a room, the   fact that you can manage cramps without drugs is amazing.  I use this book a lot!
1416583432|4.0|I have read some of the other reviews and while some make pertinent points, ie regarding the Hero experiment's failings, I also feel like judging the entire text on that one section - or on any number of things the reader might diagree with the author on - is foolish.      This book is a wonderful read. Straightforward, with many brief anecdotes of the author's own relationship with her dog, Pumpernickel...and it will provide a different framework by which to consider your dog and your dog's life as well as your dog's relationship to you and the rest of the world.      People who study animal behavior on a professional level may or may not enjoy this but for the rest of us, this book is lovely.  Raises important questions, gives some answers as well as some possibilities, and above all else reminds us that dogs are not so dim and simple and one-dimensional as so many folks might have thought.  They are amazing, intuitive, loving creatures who deserve to be respected and loved in return.  Period.      Give this book a chance...I bet you'll enjoy it - and more importantly, I bet you'll enjoy your dog that much more.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|My teen daughters and I didn't watch Glee from the beginning. But after so much hype we decided to watch and see what it was about (this is when season 2 began). We were soon hooked. Of course, this required going back and watching season 1 - hence, the purchase. This show is an absolute delight in so many ways. The songs and performances are fantastic. The humor is out of this world (especially Sue; she is so deliciously mean that you want to cheer her cruelty on!), and, excepting Finn's not-quite-believable gullibility, you too will be a Gleek.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|I was very excited to start reading this book, especially with Oprah indorsing it. It has been painful reading it. I basically have forced myself to get where I am now in the book, and dread picking it back up. I hate leaving a book unfinished, but I'm not sure that I can withstand anymore of this novel.
B003IPC5SO|2.0|Another mediocre album in 2010. Will it ever get better? or is this as good as it gets? I've been waiting since 2003 for the pop scene to revive itself and It's all been downhill since then. What happened to the full length masterpieces we got in the 80's and 90's, And the first three years of the  2000's (2000, 2001 and 2002)? Will those times ever happen again?-----> On to Kylie.<br /><br />First \\"Body Language\\", Then \\"X\\", Now this (Aphrodite). Kylie just gets further down the barrel with each NEW release.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Although \\"BL\\" and \\"X\\" were tired, we still got some hot songs like \\"Slow\\" which was untouchable. \\"Sweet Music\\" and \\"Obsession\\" were amazing but the rest of the album was a complete fail. I even liked \\"In My Arms\\", \\"No More Rain\\" and \\"Sensitized\\" and a few of the bonus tracks from \\"X\\". But this NEW album is just flat, dull, conservative and bland. The songs here all sound no different from one another. The synthesizers and production all need improvement, I don't like the sound they came up with for (aphrodite).<br /><br />I know what the main problems are. First off, Her signiture sound (pop, dance, modern disco) has all gone mainstream due to everything else (RnB, rock, Hiphop, rap etc) all being dead. Unless she wants to do a Jazz or Rocknroll record she really doesn't have much choice, other than to revert back to what she's been doing forever but take it down a few notches and be drab, What's left?. The only genre still alive and breathing here in the u.s. that's considered to be \\"Popular\\" is pop-dance and it's so commercial right now she would really have to be on top her game to deliver something with some extra appeal. Todays pop market has sold her out to what everyone else is doing.<br /><br />I've said it once and I'll say it again in this review. British popstars have always had a distinct sound when compared to the pop music here in the u.s., Due to so much exposure over the internet nowadays British pop has lost it's flare and more and more american pop producers are recycling their sound and British pop producers aren't holding up, All their stars are working with american producers and also are coming to live here.<br /><br />Second issue, I listened to the album straight through, non-stop. I remember hearing 3 songs at the most that caught my attention. I thought \\"Oh, What's that?\\" maybe 2 or 3 times, But not enough to make me want to listen over and over and over again.<br /><br />The \\"good songs\\" on this album aren't really \\"good songs\\". They're better in contrast to what else she did on the album. I even tried tuning in again and I just got bored. I then thought I'd go back and play 1 minute of each song, I ended before I began. Then, I went back and FFW through some of the songs to see if their were \\"good parts that I missed\\" in each song... Nothing. Then, I played the album on my way to work (45 min drive), And coming home from work (A little over and hour with traffic) I wasn't touched at all, I liked \\"Get Outta My Way\\" and one other song that I don't even remember the name to, And I'm not going back to find out which one it was. As you can see I was desperate to love this album, I waited too long for this album not to fight for it.<br /><br />Third issue, Kylie Minogue, Like Madonna, Janet Jackson, Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez (Say what you want) are all Pop singers. Pop singers reach their limit in the industry but to their true fans who love them dearly, they live on. Although they all may have been on earth the same amount of years, Some age faster. Kylie's vocals are'nt spunky, bubbly and bright anymore. She sounds aged. For some popstars that's a good thing, For some it's an okay and acceptable thing, For Kylie it doesn't help. Her voice sounds like an older woman with too much vibrato.<br /><br />Unless you're Patti Labelle, Barbara Striesand, Celine Dion, Cher or any other powerhouse that takes time out to excercise their vocal chords and keep them in tact there's honestly no hope for you. Their voices age gracefully and subtly you can hardly tell, unless they've done drugs (whom I wont name) What pop singer vocal trains? Britney?.<br /><br />I understand age is a part of life (hell, I'm aging), but retirement is too. Some people's time just comes faster than others. Kylie just doesn't have \\"It\\" anymore. She's worn, And this album proves that. What's wrong with having had your time?, There's nothing wrong with that. She chose to waste her time making \\"Body Language\\" and \\"X\\" when she still had something going for her. those album's have both come and gone and that's studio time and days she will not get back. She could've made some really good music.<br /><br />Unless Kylie starts making real pop songs with some groovy dance hooks, beats and perfect lyrics she wont stand a chance, And I doubt she'll ever make another fabulous record. Pop music is changing and so is her voice. So....subtly you can hardly tell, unless they've done drugs (whom I wont name) What pop singer vocal trains? Britney?.    I understand age is a part of life (hell, I'm aging), but retirement is too. Some people's time just comes faster than others. Kylie just doesn't have \\"It\\" anymore.

B00275EHJG|1.0|We love Pixar movies, in fact every one of them except this! My son ended up crying in the middle (about the background story of Latso the bear) and we had to stop. I myself have seen the movie from start to finish and did not like it. It wasnt' very funny but seemed quite dark for a kid movie. Lots of scenes where the toys are terrorized by other toys and there is nobody to defend them. There is a general sense of helplessness that permeates a lot of the movie. Two thumbs down.
B001BZF9UY|5.0|These are just a sample of quotes from the best blokbuster sequel ever made (in my opinion, anyway). The highlights for me are: \\"Like A Dog Chasing Cars,\\" \\"Aggressive Expansion,\\" \\"I'm Not A Hero,\\" \\"Harvey Two-Face,\\" \\"Agent Of Chaos,\\" \\"Watch The World Burn\\" & \\"A Dark Knight.\\" I don't much care for The Joker's suite, though. I think it should have included other instruments and been something like the \\"Psycho\\" prelude & Murder music from the iconic film. But the other tracks are excellent. Recommended.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This movie is truly outstanding.  Why is it that this book cannot be obtained through 'Kindle\\"? I cannot wait to get the book.  I agree with the critic that said the only false point is that the Pope (Pius XII) is shown as a weak pope. Those of us that lived during that time know better.
B00448SE4S|1.0|I am not a videogame connoisseur, so if I am completely off, sorry.  This was the worst movie I have seen in a while.  I really tried to watch and enjoy it, but couldn't even get myself to finish it.  I love movies of many genres and styles, but could not get into this at all.  I enjoy Michael Cera and the other actors in the film, but this was simply not my cup of tea. I hate to say it, but I want my money back for the rental.

B0022CY8WK|5.0|The soundtrack to the Academy Award winning musical \\"Chicago\\" is pretty good. Highlights (at least in my opinion) are: \\"Overture/All That Jazz,\\" \\"Funny Honey,\\" \\"When You're Good To Mama,\\" \\"Cell Block Tango,\\" the deleted song<br />\\"Class,\\" \\"Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag\\" and the song \\"Love Is A Crime.\\" Crediting Danny Elfman (best known for \\"Batman\\")<br />as the composer is really a misnomer, as all the songs (with a possible 2 or 3 exceptions) were not written by him. However, it's a great score. Word to parents: this soundtrack isn't suitable for children under 13, as \\"Cell Block Tango\\" contains some mild profanity & sexual sounds, \\"I Can't Do It Alone\\" contains one mild profanity, \\"Funny Honey\\" contains some mild profanity and the deleted song \\"Class\\" contains some strong profanity.

1439102813|5.0|(1)    I read \\"Still Alice\\" twice.  During the first read, I was so devastated that, had it not been a Book Club selection, I very likely might not have finished it.    However, for Read #2, the fear of the unknown is gone, so I could appreciate how a functional and knowledgeable family, and community, can deal with Alzheimers.  Examples include:    1.  Alice and her boss arranging for her to cease teaching.  They both make an intelligent, informed, and honest effort to craft the best solution possible.    2.  Alice improving her relationship with her youngest daughter, and enjoying her grandchildren.  Indeed, in the last chapter, Alice is not so different than a physically restricted 85+ year old.    3.  Alice's pleasant surprise at the reaction to her speech to an Alzheimer's conference.    (2)  Several other reviewers have remarked that The Author's writing style could be better.  Perhaps so; nevertheless, The Author is excellent at conveying Alice's emotional reaction to circumstances, such as the first time she cannot find her way home.    (3) A minor item:  I am reviewing the unabridged audio version, not the paperback version.

B001UHOWXI|5.0|If you are reading this review you likely already know and love this movie. For me, it is the epitome of holiday movies with great acting along with a terrific script and tight direction. If you have never seen it in some ways I envy you - just buy it and enjoy!<br /><br />As I was growing up this film was shown repeatedly on television as it had lapsed into the public domain. Somehow, it was retrieved from public domain with some legal wrangling - and though at first I thought of that as a bad thing the quality of the film has benefited now that there is money to be made on this old classic. The initial DVDs available for this film from the public domain era were very poor quality and only recently were better scans completed. That process has been taken to \\"the nth degree\\" for the blu-ray release.<br /><br />For this review I did watch the first few minutes of the Republic Pictures DVD version which last time I checked into this was the best transfer available. I recall when first seeing it that it was far superior to other versions and light-years ahead of the worn prints that used to be shown on TV. I played it on an upscaling player (actually my Sony Blu-Ray player). I then put in the Blu-Ray version and I was blown away at the improvement. The quality is really striking with facial detail and readable text, for example, on the bottles in Mr. Gower's Pharmacy. The print is totally clean and is as others have pointed out shown in the correct aspect ratio in which it was made. This means there are black bars at the sides on a wide-screen TV and this is normal and how it should be. To fill a wide screen TV would mean either stretching things so that the thin James Stewart starts to look more like Alfred Hitchcock or cutting off the top and bottom of the picture. Either of those options would go a long way toward destroying this classic. Sound quality is also excellent and clean.<br /><br />As I write this I am watching the colorized version which I feel is less impressive. While colorization has come a long way and looks less like paint-by-numbers than it used to it is still obviously added color and just distracting for us purists that love the original B&W. That said, I wonder if the colorized version will be something that might make this film more accessible to kids (though I am planning on showing the original to my 5 and 7 year old kids!)<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic buy and is a must-have for those that love this film and have a blu-ray player. I highly recommend it.tion has come a long way and looks less like paint-by-numbers than it used to it is still obviously added color and just distracting for us purists that love the original B&W.

0385339089|2.0|What exactly is exciting or suspenseful about the plot of this book?  Boy discovers secret of crime, boy is chased by feds, boy is made to divulge his secret.  Grisham milked that secret for 400+ pages, and then at the end we don't even learn the outcome of the case or whether the boy and his family are found.  Most boring read in a long time.
B001RXB4FY|5.0|I first heard the song \\"Still Counting\\" on XM Satellite radio on the Octane channel.  What a cool song!!!! The lead singer's voice makes me think of the singer in Franz Ferdinand (only a little more deeper and stronger).  Then the Pantera-like riffs start in, and it sounds like all hell is breaking loose. One thing about this band:  THEY F......ROCK!!!!! Denmark has sent upon us a cool band.<br /><br />The entire CD rocks!!!! From \\"Still Counting\\" to the remake of Hank Williams, Sr.'s \\"I'm So Lonely I Could Cry\\", it never disappoints.  This CD is worth the money spent.
0061997811|5.0|This book is packed with great images from the films and with behind-the-scenes photos and initial concept drawings. The details of the production design are highlighted throughout (get a close-up of the Burrow, look inside Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, see the entire Black family tree tapestry, etc.). Beware, though, there a few images from the last two films.    The extras packaged in glassine envelopes or glued to the pages are what put this book over the top: Harry's Hogwarts acceptance letter on school stationary (in green ink of course), a Borgin and Burkes auctioneers pamphlet showing their most famous items; Libatius Borage's Advanced Potion-Making book cover with potion stickers inside; two Honeydukes candy boxes that you can punch out and fold (sugared butterfly wings and fiery black pepper imps); the 422nd Quidditch World Cup Programme; The Yule Ball Programme; several Educational Decree mini posters; a mini Marauder's Map; Weasley's Wizard Wheezes product catalogue; and a Ministry of Magic Identity Card.    My only complaints are that some photos are small (I wish I could see some sets in larger detail), and I wish the book were longer so some subjects could be given more than 1-2 pages. More initial concept art would be great too. However, I still highly recommend the book!
0399250395|5.0|ordered this as a christmas gift but couldnt resist perusing it first. it is beautiful! every page is really a work of art and almost every page (atleast pages that have the actually caterpillar on it) have a little surprise.. you can make the caterpillar \\"inch\\" along on one page, on another the adorable caterpillar pops in one end of a watermellon nd \\"out\\" the other, its timeless. absolutely recommend

1421527618|3.0|Released as part of VIZ-Media's recent fiction line, Haikasoru, All you need is Kill was a very fast but great read. Though technically considered a light novel, you do not find any of the watered down elements a LN would normally bear. The characters are clear and enjoyable. the story is descriptive and vibrant. The novel could very easily be triple the length, but it would not make it any better. Instead, you would risk watering down its power, like small punches to your gut turning to love taps.<br /><br />Though originally written in Japanese (2004), it was recently translated by Alex Smith and pushed out to the English market.<br /><br />if you read AYNIK, you will definitely be reminded of Robotech, Groundhogs day, and general anime/manga.

0307474712|5.0|This book is great fun! I loved it. It took me a while to get into, a few chapters but once you start reading you can't put it down. This book made me laugh out loud a lot and also cry. The great thing is is that you are never really sure what is going to happen, things pop out of the blue. Please read this book, it's wonderful!
B00000J7J4|5.0|How long can Carlos keep this up. I mean c'mon, this is fantastic. Every moment, Every song, Every syllable, of this compilation should be dipped in Platinum and on display at the Smithsonian. This unique blend of styles reflects the true versatility of Santana, and spotlights some great cameos by other talented artists. If this CD is not part of your music library, well, I guess life cannot exist as we know it.   Whats to say It's Great!!!  The great Ba Ba Osc (Oscar Mendoza) has spoken.
1439177783|4.0|I listened to this book in recorded format, recorded by the author.  It was often painful to hear her tell of her struggles.  I believe this book will help many who struggle with eating disorders to realize that they are not alone and help is out there.  Though I didn't know much about Portia de Rossi before this book, I felt that she allowed the reader a peek into her soul.
B001AQO3XS|3.0|MOVIE RATING is 5 stars.<br /><br />Blu-Ray rating is 3 stars.<br /><br />This is essentially the British Blu-Ray release, but lacking the original soundtrack and that is a shame. The 5.1 remix has a great deal of reverb added and just doesn't sound as natural as the original stereo surround track, which is on the brit release and virtually uncompressed. Why studios insist on excluding original soundtracks is beyond me, but it is infuriating.<br /><br />The picture quality on this release is about the same, though possibly a tad more smoothed over. I think they might have used a little bit of grain reduction in scenes. This is comparing the releases on a 72 inch DLP. Both are great, but I give the slight edge to the Brit release.<br /><br />That Brit BD also has extras that are not on this American version.<br /><br />This is not a definitive release. It just isn't. However, it is most certainly superior to any American version released on DVD. The UK Amazon has the Brit release so I urge you to buy that one instead. It will play in American BD players. Should you not have the extra cash then go ahead and pull the trigger as long as you understand you won't have the sound that the film was intended to have.
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|I really love this new cd.  I'm such a fan and this is even better than the Killers' cd's.  I highly recommend this cd.
B00004RFFI|4.0|What makes TWISTER such an enjoyable film isn't the individual actors' portrayals (though two of the cast, Helen Hunt and Phillip Seymour Hoffman went on to win Oscars for other films), but rather the sense of mad exuberance that permeates this film, much like another Hoffman vehicle, [[ASIN:B00320J6WS Pirate Radio]]. Although the \\"divorcing couple\\" plotline holds no surprises, the rest of the film does. TWISTER is a rush.<br /><br />Bill (Bill Paxton) and Jo (Helen Hunt) are two storm-chasing meterorologists in northern Oklahoma. They are the couple who are on the cusp of divorce. As a matter of fact, Bill has returned to rural Oklahoma from his job in the city as a TV meteorologist to force Jo's hand into signing the divorce papers, and he's brought his fiancee Melissa (Jami Gertz), a psychotherapist, along as proof that the marriage is truly ended. Predictably, of course it isn't, and once Jo and Bill see each other their relationship, as tempestuous as a twister, begins anew, leaving Melissa to blow in the wind.<br /><br />What isn't so predictable is the pirate energy of Jo and Bill's storm-chasing crew. Nominally a group of scientists, they're really a bunch of adrenaline junkies who get off on putting themselves in harm's way. Jo, for her part, has an Ahabian obsession to conquer tornadoes, since she lost her father to one.<br /><br />Jo, both sexy and ramshackle in her wife-beater top and chinos, reflects her crew perfectly. Their vehicles are dented and battered. They're ballcap wearing, mullet-headed geniuses who whoop and holler ever louder as storms toss farmhouses into the air (\\"We're in the suck zone! Yeah!\\") and fix their ratty equipment with baling wire and chewing gum. They hate Jason (Cary Elwes) a rival storm-chaser who has sold out by accepting corporate sponsorship and drives shiny new Hummers with all the fixings and a Doppler radar you can see your face in. Both groups have developed a new technology to inject sensors into storms (Jo's homemade \\"Dorothy\\" and Jason's factory milled \\"Dot\\"), and it's a race to see who does it first.<br /><br />A veritable conga line of tornadoes begins to spawn, and the crew races headlong over the area trying to \\"study\\" them.  Bill joins them, despite his promises to Melissa. Melissa is in hysterics after Bill's truck gets spun like a top by three nearby waterspouts, but Bill and Jo are both exhilarated. Melissa, seeing how the wind is blowing, ends the engagement.<br /><br />The crew dash to the town of Wakita, where Jo's p*ss-and-vinegar Aunt Meg lives, to stoke up on food. As they eat, they hear of an F5 tornado, the most powerful type, in the area, and pile pell-mell out the door to find it. It finds them first, and devastates Wakita, but the huge F5 storm provides some of the best CGI disaster footage ever, as gasoline tankers and combines fly like matchsticks, a cow jumps over the moon, and houses implode. The cow is an inspired addition, the signature of this picture. (TWISTER was also the first-ever DVD release and the last-ever DVD-HD release, and the second highest-grossing film of 1996.) All ends relatively well, though nobody in the picture is ever really down to earth.  Particularly the cow.<br /><br />A great light film that will have you hopping in your seat, TWISTER is well worth owning.s factory milled \\"Dot\\"), and it's a race to see who does it first.

B004B8RWX0|5.0|Although I never read the comics and didn't know anything about the author I have found the show to be interesting and fun. I will enjoy this for as long as it runs. I am a little confused and frustrated by Amazon not clarifying when the show will actually be available for watching. The show is playing right now in the Central Time Zone I am in Arizona and would like to know when I can start watching. Is it available the same night, the next day, two hours after original air...when?
B0044XV3QY|1.0|Downside:  No digital copy !?   Really -- wow, cheap...    And no discount coupon or rebate offered for people who ponied up the $30 for the first Blu-ray release.    Upside:  16 minutes of footage.....    My vote on this one ----  Pass, rent it maybe for the 16 minutes of footage, but its not worth buying.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I just finished reading this book on my Kindle which is the third book of the Trilogy and I can say that this one is the absolute best!  They are all good, but this one is non-stop action and you are constantly \\"rooting\\" for the underdog...I loved it and recommend this book as well as all 3 in the Trilogy.  If you want a novel that oozes \\"girl power\\" this is it!!!
0765326353|5.0|Not for youth, unless they are accustomed to a hearty read (not due to sexual content at all, of which I do not remember there being any.). Very well laid out, very imaginative book. My only complaint is that book 2 is not out yet!
B0042AEOG0|5.0|It's too bad u can only listen to this cd once a year during the holidayz.  Why would u ever listen to christmas music in July?  Mariah saves her good vocals for christmas music because her voice is reminiscent of her earlier recordings when u could hear and understand the actual lyrics of the song.  I love the songs \\"Oh Santa\\" and \\"When Christmas Comes\\", 2 of the original new songs only Mariah sings.  I like \\"O Holy Night\\" live version but that song is on her first christmas cd and I like the studio version better.  \\"Charlie Brown Christmas\\" is cute, it's strange hearing Mariah singing it but it works for the holiday effect.  I didn't really like \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\", it's the only song on the cd that's a downer, it's just a dumb song for Mariah to be singing but I guess she had to cover every Christmas song ever made.  I guess on her next christmas cd she'll have to do Frosty the Snowman and Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer, yikes!  I also didn't like the duet she did with her mother.  The whole opera thing sounded bizarre.  Mariah just had to hook up her mother eventually, I hate saying things like that but I got creeped out when I heard it.  \\"All I Want For Christmas is You\\" sounded basically the same as the original version.  I think that song is a bit overrated, what's so great about it?  This is still a wonderful christmas cd and it will be nice to play again during christmas time.  It's not even Thanksgiving and I've already listened to it 3 times. Ho Ho Ho Mariah U Go Go Go girl!
B003U0AHBO|2.0|Beautifully filmed but has a crappy, stupid script--a major disappointment. Lots of wasted talent.<br /><br />I've been a huge fan of Ridley Scott, Max von Sydow, Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett, and William Hurt for many, many years. This is by far their worst film.<br /><br />Some reviewers CLAIM to know about 12th-century English history. Most of them are deluding themselves. The music and musical instruments are not authentic. The use of surnames is bogus (they came in later than the time of this film). The weaponry is partly wrong. And the too-early death of one of the key historical characters AND the invasion of England with what look like World War 2-era landing craft (with the King of France watching offshore) are just factually wrong and totally stupid.<br /><br />And what of the stone mason who was a genius and dreamed up the Magna Carta before there was one? And the nobility listened to him? Eh? It never happened, nor would it ever have happened for many reasons, including the feudal class system.<br /><br />As for bonus features (\\"the making of\\"; \\"the director's commentary\\"; etc.)--there ARE none. No cast members are even in a short clip telling us how great the experience was or how wonderful Ridley Scott was to work with.<br /><br />Buy GLADIATOR. Buy ALIEN. Buy BLADE RUNNER. Buy KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. Buy MASTER AND COMMANDER. Buy LORD OF THE RINGS. But only RENT this piece of nonsense.

B002VPE1B6|2.0|Like I say in the title, this is a review of the Avatar Blu-ray, not the movie itself, as nearly everyone has seen this movie in theaters.    The GOOD- video quality here is AMAZING!  This is the best looking Blu-ray I have ever seen.  Nothing can compare to it, not Toy Story 3, the matrix trilogy, the dark knight, etc.  This is the best looking Blu-ray I think ever made.  Inside the case, it has a coupon that says \\"this movie Blu-ray was made for avatar.\\"  They are not kidding the picture quality is easily the best ever. The audio is spectacular as well and is a true showcase of what Blu-ray has to offer.    The BAD- this is a barebones release, literally, no extra anything.  You can download some low quality extras if you use BD Live.  This is ridiculous and I don't know why they tried to make money off of this barebones release.  20th Century Fox should be ashamed of themselves for releasing something null of extras.  Seriously, nobody purchases a movie that is devoid of extra content, you might as well downlo...I mean acquire the movie by other means if you that is all you want.  If I did not receive this BD as a gift I would be highly upset.    and The UGLY- um...there is nothing about ugly about the quality of this astounding 1080p transfer.  However I must point out that this is really a shameless attempt to make money off people who couldn't wait to (yeah I'm going to say it) whom couldn't wait to return to Pandora.    Buy the version that comes out Nov 16th instead!
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Package came right on time and in perfect unopened condition.  I didn't expect this quality from 'used' but this company is the way to go for all my future cd purchases.
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|OK, let me state that I loved the series and enjoyed the first movie ( except for that terrible wedding look for the Carrie character ). Moving along, the story was completely ridiculous, with the exception of The Charlotte and Miranda Late Night Heart To Heart. I had hoped the writers would flesh out the characters' lives and and show some growth and maturity in all the relationships, but they took the easy way out, sometimes moving in a \\" let's wrap this up \\" direction. The character of Carrie was totally annoying. She spent the series in a desperate search for her great love and learning nothing, apparently. The Samantha character is a bit too long in the tooth to be playing The Eternal Vamp and seems mired in Porkys', bad make up, worse hair and clothing. The only saving grace was Charlotte and Miranda - both ladies appearing to grow in substance and in their relationships. The storyline was totally unbelievable, even for this fan of SATC. To show Samantha melting down so fast because of menopause and being unable to have access to supplements didn't ring true and her behavior was way over the top. Especially in the Middle East, which bought into most unfortunate stereotypes. The wedding ? Oh, please. It also played into every possible gay stereotype. I knew the writers didn't have a clue about the characters when I caught the response from the Anthony character about his ethnicity. When asked why he was allowed a certain behavior, it was ok, because he said he is Italian. In the series, the Anthony character made a point of noting he was not Italian, but Sicilian. Maybe it's nitpicking, but this sort of mistake almost defines the mistakes in this movie. While I would welcome another SATC movie, I would hope the writers and stylists use common sense, taste and figure out that these are characters we have watched and we know.
B003DT19F0|5.0|We own all 3 Tinkerbell movies and my 2 & 5 yr old daughters love them all.  This one I think is my favorite, my 5 year old cannot decide, she won't pick a favorite. I would say, that I felt this one was more \\"girlie\\" than the others have been, maybe that is just me, but I have advised all my friends of boys who have watched the other Tink movies and enjoyed them; boys may  not be as interested in this one. Maybe its b/c Tinks new \\"friend\\" is a little girl and it has alot to do with this little girl and boys may be bored with that.    *****Highly recommend!!!!!!!!*****

B003VPWXRO|5.0|Portia pours her heart out.   A book that is utterly and brutally honest.  A very courageous move of the author to recall those dark ages of her life.  I feel bad for her and I feel bad as I was like sneaking someone's very private life.   Worth a read, no matter you are gay, anorexic or simply lost control of your life, it helps!
0525951652|3.0|Like many of the other reviewers I read a lot of Ken Follett's books .    I was really looking forward to read \\"Fall of  Giants\\" as my father served in WWI. I also lived in all major countries mentioned , i.e. in the US., Great Britain, France , Germany and former Yugoslavia,    but not in Russia, though I have known Russians all my life.  When I started the book I had that strange feeling of \\"déjà vu\\" or more \\"deja read\\". And this feeling stayed with me through the whole book. Of course I knew I had not glanced at the book before, but I had been very interested in that part of history and in all these countries involved and subsequently had read a lot about the subject.     So maybe I was a little bit disappointed that I did not learn  so much as I  profited from for  example  \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".  Or maybe I had read too many books of Follett and there was a certain repetition factor, I just was not so fascinated as I was with his other books.     I also thought that the characterization of the different nationalities was a little bit too cliché. Of course this is the generation of my parents and grand-parents, who I did not know  yet at the turn of the former century, only in their later years of life. But in all these countries I have met the so-called upper and lower class people and only in movies I have seen over-sexed British  aristocrats (White Mischief comes to mind) , cruel Russian princesses,  faithful German diplomats  and clean-cut American advisers to presidents.  In real life I also have seen no rag-to-riches life dramas. I read about them in tabloids though. I guess the whole book felt a little bit tabloid.     Well, I should not complain the book helped me through a few days in bed due to a severe cold.
B0041T7FS6|5.0|I'm absolutely thrilled that Nile Rodgers has finally gave us this box set!!  And the selections are varied and many are rare-  I just wish the entire Johnny Mathis album could've been put on here.  There are 3 Johnny songs and a fourth one is on the new 2013 CHIC ORGANIZATION: UP ALL NIGHT THE GREATEST HITS - 2 cd set just released (it's a somewhat condensed version of this 4 cd box set), along with some alternate choices- but that's not all! There is now a second CHIC ORGANIZATION: UP ALL NIGHT 2 cd set called THE DISCO EDITION (Disc 1 is the same as the first 2cd set, the disc 2 however replaced the last few songs with other songs). But no more unreleased Johnny Mathis songs. I mentioned before that I think the reason Johnny's record label, Columbia Records, didn't release the infamous Chic produced album was because around that time (1980/1981) Johnny had done an interview with US magazine (the rip off of PEOPLE magazine) and in the interview he came out of the closet- why he chose to do that with US magazine and why he chose that time to do it, I don't know- but I think perhaps the powers that be at Columbia might've been upset because it would be silly to follow that revelation with an album called &#34;I LOVE MY LADY&#34;.  True, they could have simply called the album something else, but an album full of love songs about women definitely would've been silly after that. Anyway, that's what I think.  I still have the US magazine interview and still wonder what provoked him to do that?  Nobody really cares these days, but back then in 1980/1981 I can see a record company freaking out.  I was so proud of him when I read that interview, but then I digress.  Anyway, I love this box set and can't wait for the Volume 2 box set.  If Nile Rodgers just happens to read the reviews for his music, and he happens to stumble upon this review, I would like to make some suggestions. Since there probably isn't enough material in the &#34;vaults&#34; to do another 4 cd box set,then I have some PERFECT ideas for you that you could use to make it a full 4 cd box set:  1. I think it would be fantastic and absolutely so much fun if you filled up disc 1 and 2 with whatever you have left, including the early years when Nile Rodgers/Bernard Edwards/Tony Thompson and lead singer Bobby Cotter were The Big Apple Band- there are 2 video clips of them performing in New York- &#34;Get Away&#34; and the Bee Gees cover &#34;You Should Be Dancing&#34;, on youtube. Also, the rest of the Johnny Mathis songs, the complete unreleased FONZI THORNTON Chic-produced debut album FROSTBITE, any possible Norma Jean Wright songs that were supposed to go with her &#34;HIGH SOCIETY&#34; song and album that never materialized.  2. Then, you could do something special with DISC 3- How about all the demos Chic did that they gave to the other artists? You know, the 'vocal guide' demos.  This way we would have Chic versions with the original Chic singers singing &#34;UPSIDE DOWN&#34;, &#34;I'M COMING OUT&#34;, &#34;WHY?&#34;, &#34;I GOT TO LOVE SOMEBODY TODAY&#34;, &#34;SPACER&#34;, etc.  IF none of those demos have survived (and how sad would that be!), then how about if DISC 3 was instead, hold your breath and wait for it...wait for it... ALL those songs that Chic wrote for all those other artists, recorded today by the still surviving trio of Norma Jean Wright/Luci Martin/Alfa Anderson??? Wouldn't that just blow your mind to hear those 3 ladies singing these songs?!?!?- &#34;WE ARE FAMILY&#34;, &#34;SPACER&#34;, UPSIDE DOWN&#34;, &#34;WHY?&#34;, &#34;REACH YOUR PEAK&#34;, etc. (Norma Jean Wright & Luci Martin go by the name &#34;The First Ladies Of Chic&#34; on their recordings over the past few years- see my review of Norma Jean Wright's debut album &#34;NORMA JEAN&#34; for more info.  Those 3 ladies actually regrouped in 2010 as REUNION, for the cd single &#34;MY LOVER'S ARMS&#34;, so it could happen....) I would pay $100 for that box set if disc 3 had this idea.  And perhaps so would MANY, MANY die-hard Chic fans!! Nile Rodgers and these 3 ladies back together for a collection of songs would be so phenomenal!   (***UPDATE: AUGUST 19th, 2015:  Aristofreeks have released a song called GOOD TIMES (cd single with 4 remixes) with NEXT STEP (Alfa Anderson/Luci Martin/Norma Jean Wright).  These 3 women were calling themselves REUNION in 2010 and now they are NEXT STEP, and yes GOOD TIMES is the CHIC remake.  They also have put out the song GET ON UP (cd single with 4 remixes) also with NEXT STEP Feat. Kathy Sledge.  How wonderful is that!? The original CHIC women WITH Kathy Sledge!!)  3. BUT don't stop there.... THEN make disc 4 the Ultimate Chic Fan cd- since all the artists Chic worked with are still alive (with the exception of Teddy Pendergrass), how about a great cd of all those artists covering each others songs?!?!?! Johnny Mathis would obviously cover &#34;I'M COMING OUT&#34; (so tongue-in-chic) and &#34;THINKING OF YOU&#34;, Diana Ross could do fantastic versions of &#34;HIGH SOCIETY&#34; & &#34;MATERIAL GIRL&#34; (yes folks, Nile Rodgers may have produced Madonna's 2nd album LIKE A VIRGIN, but the Chic Organization members worked on 3 of that albums songs- go check the credits and you'll see why this qualifies as Chic songs. Same with Jody Watley's debut album- 3 songs. Ironically, Jodie recorded her own version of &#34;I WANT YOUR LOVE&#34; in 2006). Of course, in order to make this work, some liberties would have to be taken- DISC 3 above could stick to Chic-penned songs, while DISC 4 could take some liberties and include songs that Chic performed on, and not necessarily wrote), Carly Simon could do &#34;BACKFIRED&#34; & &#34;SHOO-BE-DOO&#34; (I can just hear Carly's voice singing that now), Debbie Harry could do a techno-trance &#34;SPACER&#34; & &#34;GOT TO LOVE SOMEBODY TODAY&#34;, Sister Sledge could do &#34;SATURDAY (I JUST CAN&#34;T WAIT TIL)&#34; & &#34;DON'T YOU WANT ME&#34;, Sheila (& B. Devotion) could do &#34;LOST IN MUSIC&#34; & &#34;FRANKIE&#34;. Just think- each artist could do 2 songs each of each others music!!  I would seriously pay $200 for this box set if all 4 discs were done as described above.  This would be thee ultimate Chic box set, surely outselling Volume One, and all of us Chic fans could be satisfied and content for the rest of our lives.  Oh well, it's just a suggestion. And a dream. I absolutely LOVE Chic and their songs, but let's face it, you can only keep releasing repackaged Chic material for so long, unfortunately, Soooooo.... use my ideas above and give the fans what they would love and cherish and then all you would have to do Nile, in the future, is perhaps a great cd of today's artists covering Chic songs on a CHIC TRIBUTE cd. Seriously, Volume Two- as described above would be heaven.  Any die-hard Chic fanatics agree? So far, as mentioned above, Jody Watley has already recorded &#34;I WANT YOUR LOVE&#34; (2006), and Sister Sledge has already recorded 3 Chic songs in 1993- &#34;EVERYBODY DANCE&#34;, &#34;I WANT YOUR LOVE&#34;, and &#34;GOOD TIMES&#34;, and Chic themselves have recorded 3 Sister Sledge songs- &#34;WE ARE FAMILY&#34;, &#34;HE'S THE GREATEST DANCER&#34; (1996) and &#34;THINKING OF YOU&#34; in 2011. So the idea isn't too far out there.  We just need new, fresh studio versions of all this. ;)  AND.... you could have GRANDMASTER do an 80 minute megamix of all CHIC songs and the songs CHIC wrote for others- all together in a glorious dance megamix!, then offer it as an exclusive disc that only the people who bought the SAVIOR FAIRE boxset Volume 2 can get by going to the website and submitting the code to download it.  Just some ideas for ya Nile.....
B0044XV3R8|3.0|I'll give Avatar kudos for the graphics and imagery; however, in 1992 a cartoon was released called Fern Gully.  The premise of Avatar is an up-to-date, graphically-improved copy of Fern Gully.  I don't get the hype for this movie.  I saw it once and that is enough.
0312600844|4.0|This book is a grueling read, with some central conceptual flaws, but it is also ultimately a masterpiece. I would not want to suffer through this again, but I'm glad I did. Franzen's style is a bit pedestrian and flat at times, in part due to his naturalistic mode (as in Theodore Dreiser's fiction) and I missed the more emotive, lyrical style of \\"The Corrections,\\" but his sheer intelligence and his understanding of the connections between the social microcosm of the family and the macrocosm of the world outside are extraordinary.        I found Walter Berglund's signing on to the scheme of allowing mountain top removal in exchange for saving the habitat of one bird species hard to believe, but in so many other ways Walter's dogged decency and strength were strongly affecting and such a relief from the slick hedonism that dominates so many contemporary fictional characters. The last 20 pages were so powerful and moving, they justified the whole long slog of putting up with almost 600 pages of the screwed up Berglund family, and I ended \\"Freedom\\"shaken and in tears.

B000005JA8|5.0|This is my favourite album, hands down. It truly does take a few listens, but Beefheart and his legion of Magic Band memebers have molded my heart into a truly perfect trout mask replica. The first time I heard this album, I wanted to throw it away, burn it, and forget it. Seeing as how I bought the album, I gave it another try. Still not liking it I put it back on the shelf, at least I could appreciate the cover. This cycle repeated itself for about a month when I realized that the raspy poetry, fractured guitar riffs, off time jazz bass, and split time drums were all for a good reason. It took a few more times yet, but it is now my favourite album. I hear something new every time, I can listen to it any time, any day. Thank you Beefheart, for making my life complete.
0446569895|4.0|The book is very well written, and details Ozzy's life from a kid all the way up until now. There are plenty of crazy stories, emotional moments, and interesting looks at some already famous moments.     The only real problem I have with this book, is how much of an \\"overview\\" it is. Some of the pretty important parts are not in here at all. He doesn't talk much about the guitar players he went through in the 1980's (Jake E. Lee, Zakk Wylde etc). He never really talks about being in the studio, writing songs, writing melodies, etc.     However, it is still very interesting. It gives you a different look at the Osbournes era, and really focuses on his battles with alcoholism and drug addiction. It shows the Black Sabbath era pretty clearly, and you see the struggles they went through with that.     All in all, it was really one of the best biographies I've read recently, and I would definetly advise buying it.
B0042UEU8M|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best movies I have watched in years. From the wonderful acting, script, setting - fantastic!
B003UERZ88|2.0|All I can say is if the last song would have been 1st,and the rest of the album followed this path it would have been a killer album! The lyrics on this are as childish as I have ever heard.Even my wife was trying not to laugh when I played it for her.She asked me what the hell Rob was thinking on this one.???We are both long time Priest fans and love war of words(fight).yep very disappointed in this one.<br />I do highly reccommend the newest Testament album (very heavy and tight)
B0018087TC|5.0|Although Miles Davis' masterpiece \\"Kind of Blue\\" might be the most listened to jazz album of all time-and it deserves to be-jazz fans should take note that \\"Chet Baker in Tokyo\\" more than holds its own as far as musical quality and inventiveness are concerned. To add to the intrigue, Miles, Evans, Coltrane, Adderley, et.al., were at their musical peaks when \\"Blue\\" was recorded. Chet, on the other hand, because of his unpredictability brought about by his much chronicled addiction, was considered by many critics to be a couple of decades past his peak . Yet, on that magical night in Tokyo, with dentures firmly in place, the jazz icon displayed incredible technique, ideas and control on such challenging tunes as \\"Seven Steps to Heaven,\\" and \\"Four.\\" With the masterful support of a rhythm ensemble reminicent of the best of trios that painted a special satisfying texture to the Stan Getz and Miles Davis groups, Baker played the most exciting rendition of \\"My Funny Valentine\\" that I've ever heard from Chet or anyone else. Perhaps most suprising for a musician not known for his range and technical dexterity, Baker's flurry of perfect notes formed a magnificent weave of spellbinding phrases. Solos by the swinging and lyrical Harold Danko on piano paced by the highly inventive bassist, Hein Van Der Geyn, and a Tony Williams like performance by drummer, John Engels, made the moments when Chet wasn't performing so pleasing and captivating to this listener that, at times, I nearly forgot that Chet was the headliner.     If the ballad, \\"For All We Know\\" fails to tug at the listener's heart strings, then he/she knows little of the passion that gives jazz its soul. Not only was his trumpet playing exciting and elegant, Chet's haunting vocal rendition of \\"Almost Blue\\" equaled his classic 1950's performance of \\"Everything Happens to Me.\\"     From time to time, I wonder if those Japanese jazz fans understood how fortunate they were to watch and listen to a revitalized Chet Baker at his very best on that magical evening in Tokyo.

1401302378|4.0|The author explains the changing technology and how it is desirable for businesses to accommodate for the long tail. He further mentioned that mass culture is replaced by a series of niches and business need to take advantage of the situation. Long Tail has a great influence in our life today, and it will continue to impact our future lives and culture as well.  The book is a great introduction of Long Tail theory, and it also discusses the changing culture of business and the way we do it these days. Long tail is an economic theory that talks about how internet, Cable TV and other technological advancement make consumers to have wider options than ever before, and as a result there exists new and plenty market opportunities (Niche) due to customization effect. Long Tail is a statistical distribution that shows the hit sales of new products as their sales fade slowly over time to form a tail. For example, Michael Jackson thriller was a hit back in the 80's and the sold about 110 million copies to date. The sales did not happen the same year it got out but over the years, and that is spread of sales over the period of time which the author refers as \\"Long Tail.\\"  Finally, due to scarcity companies have been forced to cut the tail off somewhere, but today online stores like Amazon, Netflix, eBay, iTunes, and Rhapsody, have the competence to sell a much greater variety of product for a longer period of time.  They can just let the tail grow as long as it can go, and the companies can just make infinite profits from the hits and niches. It is an interesting and compelling, but it was only focused on the entertainment business.

B0042JH05I|5.0|Filmed in June 2010 at New York's famous Roseland Ballroom, this concert blu-ray captures Phil Collins taking his new album \\"Going Back\\" into the live arena.  Backed by an 18-piece band, Phil Collins covers the soul and Motown classics that he loved as a teenager.  This is not a concert of Phil Collins songs - he describes this production as  \\"a Phil Collins blu-ray with nothing but Motown and Soul music on it\\".<br /><br />'Going Back - Live at the Roseland Ballroom' is a real chance to get up close and personal with Phil Collins as he covers the greats including  Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and William 'Smokey' Robinson.<br /><br />SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGES<br /><br />If you enjoy [[ASIN:B003X5F4R8 Rod Stewart's Great American Songbook series]], then you'll certainly love Phil Collins' \\"Going Back\\".<br /><br />On this blu-ray, Phil Collins passionately recreates the soul and Motown classics that he listened to and loved since his early music days of being a drummer in his school band and subsequently joining the group Genesis in 1971.<br /><br />In September 2010, Phil released the audio CD [[ASIN:B003HC8I5M Going Back]] to complement this concert that took place in June 2010.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Track Listing:<br /><br />Intro: Signed, Sealed, Delivered<br />Ain't Too Proud to Beg<br />Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)<br />Dancing in the Street<br />(Love Is Like a) Heatwave<br />Papa Was a Rollin' Stone<br />Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer<br />Jimmy Mack<br />You've Been Cheating<br />Do I Love You<br />Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever<br />Going to a Go-Go<br />Blame It on the Sun<br />Ain't That Peculiar<br />Too Many Fish in the Sea<br />You've Really Got a Hold on Me<br />Something about You<br />The Tears of a Clown<br />Nowhere to Run<br />In My Lonely Room<br />Take Me in Your Arms, Rock Me a Little While<br />Uptight (Everything's Alright)<br />Going Back<br />Talking about My Baby<br />You Can't Hurry Love<br />My Girl<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br />Rehearsal footage with Phil Collins<br />Interview with Phil<br /><br />VIDEO: 1080i Widescreen 16x9 (1.78:1)<br />AUDIO: Dolby True HD, DTS HD Master Audio, LPCM Stereo<br />Running Time: 126 minutes<br /><br />Phil Collins really put his heart and soul in his rendition of \\"Too Many Fish in the Sea\\".<br /><br />\\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\\" and \\"The Tears of a Clown\\" brought out the best in the 'The Funk Brothers' and the rest of Phil Collins' band, including members from his old pop group Genesis.<br /><br />I may be putting myself on a limb here, but Phil's lighter take on \\"The Tears of a Clown\\" is as good as William 'Smokey' Robinson himself!  Funk Brothers', Bob Babbitt plays the bass line here.  Babbit in fact, wrote and played the bass line for 'Smokey' Robinson 1967 original recording of \\"The Tears of a Clown\\"!  So, crank up the volume and enjoy this Motown hit which Phil Collins describes as having 'one of the most fantastic bass lines in a pop song'.<br /><br />\\"Papa was a Rollin' Stone\\" can only be seen as a great tribute to the songwriters Barrett Strong (rest his soul) and Norman Withfield.<br /><br />\\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\" - will have you dancing your blues away!<br /><br />With the last track \\"My Girl\\", the Roseland Ballroom turned into one big karaoke party, as Phil had everyone on their feet and singing.  You'll be doing the same long after the credits are posted!<br /><br />4.5 stars as 'a cover of soul and Motown Music'.  Phil's 'blue-eyed soul' voice is too soft for some of the tracks.<br /><br />5 Stars as 'A PHIL COLLINS BLU-RAY with nothing but Motown and Soul music on it'!<br />If you love Motown, Soul, The Funk Brothers, Genesis and, of course Phil Collins, then [[ASIN:B0042JH05I Phil Collins: Going Back - Live at the Roseland Ballroom NYC [Blu-ray]]] is a must have!<br /><br />RECOMMENDED: You'll also enjoy listening to this cover of 60's music by former ABBA singer Agnetha F&auml;ltskog:  [[ASIN:B0001Y4KA6 My Colouring Book]]. Agnetha is my favorite female vocal!<br /><br />Neil Diamond's new CD [[ASIN:B0041U7RE2 Dreams]] is also in keeping with this genre of retro covers..

B000T05R8Q|3.0|The man's done it again!! Yet again, Storm has released a new viewer-friendly conceptual art project using the same crusty old tracks from pink floyd's back catalouge (the one's that the record company keeps re-releasing by using the continually updated, flashy redesigned packaging that Storm is so good at. Storm thorgerson is Sony Music's pink floyd cash cow. His association with the band has yeilded excellent karma for him. I want to give a shout out to storm: Sell your great artwork to people specifically looking for art and stop whoring yourself to the record companies shameless process of re-selling the same old albums that we've already bought. C'mon, man! Find some integrity within!!
B000SEGEKI|4.0|I love this book; others have covered how great it is sufficiently. I thought I'd just address one thing: Having just received the Kindle DXG, which I purchased whilst reading this very book on my Android phone - yes, I did say that I love this book! - there is one issue that concerns me. The book features a number of illustrations and code examples presumably coded as images, and on the DXG they appear to be stretched out to fill the horizontal width 100%.     This creates some very bad typography in certain cases. I prefer my font size to be the smallest, and the illustrations will sometimes stand out like a heavily pixelated 10 foot poster. See example picture here - [...]. On my Nexus One, the image will just stay centred without the silly stretching - this looks much neater and less in-my-face. I presume this was done intentionally when creating the Kindle edition, so I'd appreciate if it could be updated to let images be 1:1 up to the point of filling the entire width of the screen.
B0044XV3QY|3.0|I don't know why they haven't produced this in the original movie format.  Most movies today are shot in 2:40 to 1 ratio.  They've only released all versions in the 1.78 to 1 ratio to fit widescreen TV's.  Unless the movie version was only shot in 1:78 to 1 ratio (which I doubt) I plan to wait until they come out will the full lettrbox version, which will be the real movie version.
B000NA28I4|4.0|the video is nice but as with any movie it does not always depict the book's total essence. Nice try.  However,  my purchase was great and the video was in awesome shape. would buy form this seller again.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|It still remains one of my favourite movies of all time. The added song didn't do all that for me, but the rest of it was thoroughly enjoyable.  The film clearly shows you the difference between good and bad as well as having a capturing love story and gorgeous tunes to sing along to.      A Disney Classic not soon forgotten.    Thank you to Amazon and the trader for delivering to me    KEEP SMILING
B0041OJ0Y8|4.0|The pre-release that was launched on their website in the beginning of the year was where it was at. $0$ is definitely good, and awesome if this is your first exposure just missing some of key songs that make the album.<br /><br />\\"Evil Boy\\" is one of those songs/videos that is iffy in terms of the new stuff. Seems more of a shock and awe song than a quality one like their others.<br /><br />\\"She Makes me a Killer\\" - is a good song and I think their best in terms of new ones (in terms of whats added from the pre-release).<br /><br />What's missing was \\"You don't know me\\" which they might hold on to for their solo cds to come but it was a great song. It can be had on their EP \\"5\\" as well.<br /><br />Overall, if you found them through \\"Evil Boy\\", listen to the CD and you will be surprised that there is some good music to be had along with their funky original sound. And don't be embarrassed to like them, as their sound is infectious.
0486281523|5.0|I consider myself above average in math skills, maybe even in the 90th percentile, and I had difficulty solving many of these puzzles.  But that is not to say that I did not enjoy reading the solutions once I had given up on the questions. The level of difficulty of the puzzles makes it that much more rewarding when you solve one. Of course, since these puzzles have been around for years, you may have already seen some (perhaps many) of them.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|This release seems to be a lot more \\"raw\\" than his previous albums. But that's a good thing, considering Josh Groban has one of the best voices in modern classical and pop music. His voice is showcased much more on this cd, which makes it by far his best work to date. Grab it!
B000002MIY|4.0|This second solo album from Steely Dan singer Donald Fagan bubbles and pops with driving jazzy grooves.  It's not the masterpiece that his first effort, \\"The Nightfly\\" was, but it's still quite good.  \\"Tomorrow's Girls\\" has the most memorable refrain, but other favorites include \\"Trans-Island Skyway\\", \\"Countermoon\\", \\"Springtime\\", \\"Florida Room\\" and \\"Teahouse on the Tracks\\" which has some nice horn licks.  The slower tunes, \\"Snowbound\\" and \\"On the Dunes\\" are actually a bit of a bore.  But the biggest weakness of this fine CD is the perhaps the over-polished production and static arrangements that make these songs all sound too much the same.  A little more variety would have been welcome.  Fans of Steely Dan should definitely look into this.
0891349553|4.0|Katherine Dewey is a FABULOUS clay artist.  I've bought all of her books.  The instructions are excellent; however, I took one point off for not  going into more detail on how to create the aluminum armatures.  Scrunching up  aluminum foil is not as easy as one might think.  Newbies like me need  as much idiot-proofing as we can get.    I guess I'll be going thru a few boxes of tin foil before I get an armature right.    I just hope I can get one to look like a characature of her art.

B0000942HV|1.0|John Cleese reprising Vivian Stanshall role as master of ceremonies on a Tubular Bells remaster is utterly pretentious and downright awful.     Vivian Stanshall might have been drunk when he was the Master of Ceremonies on the original (and best!) version of Tubular Bells, yet his improvisation of the introduction of instruments was pure genius.     Mike should have remembered Vivian's genius when he was looking for a voice over for the 2003 version of Tubular Bells.     Nb. Vivian Stanshall drunk reference see; Changeling Mike Oldfield's Autobiography.
0345509617|5.0|A long-awaited book on the making of the greatest B-series movie of all time. 35 years after the first release of ESB, the film has kept a lot of secrets about his production story, and it is a real pleasure to learn at last about how the film was built. The only other book available on the subject was \\"A journey to the making of Empire strikes back\\", published and never reprinted in 1980.  Great work, Mr Rinzler and see ya next round for the making of \\"Return of the Jedi\\".
0307588335|5.0|This is extremely well done account of Lehman Brothers.   What academic accounts of financial disasters usually miss is the speed with which established institutions (especially financial) collapse.  This melt-down was avoidable and the book  explicitly details the critical mistakes, hubris, etc that led to the disaster.  For those subject to an MBA degree, every business policy course will celebrate visionary CEOs such as Bill Gates and Jack Welch, there are empire builders like Dick Fuld - a fact that screams for corporate governance reform.  This book should be required reading.
B00004RF83|5.0|Seven Days in May is an outstanding film--among my five favorite films. The cast is first-rate and the acting is superb. The tension between Lancaster and Douglas makes it a terrific military/political thriller. I first saw it on the screen in my 20's and most recently in my 70's. I enjoyed it immensely every time I've seen it.
B000EXZI1E|5.0|It's a great Album from the greatest group in music history.  Love every song, wish I'd would have purchased it years ago.
0061537969|3.0|An easy read with an unusual twist and sense of humor. Seen through the eyes of the dog it shows the dogs prospectives on life. It also gives an in sight into car racing, as seem through the eyes of a dog! Good book.
B002MUAJ2A|1.0|A very disappointing book. I've read Getting Real and that book was fantastic years ago. Since then, the 37signals lost its good arguments and started to be arrogant and simplist (both in Rework and its blog, Signal vs. Noise).<br /><br />There is nothing new in Rework. This is book is full of obvious things. But the worst part is the arrogant tone included in all chapters. 37signals is a successful company using some techniques. And now they claim that ONLY businesses following their advices will succeed. This is very arrogant, mainly because they don't give arguments in this book. It's only \\"It worked for us. So it's the right way for everybody.\\".<br /><br />Take the classic Complexity vs. Simplicity debate. Instead of saying that they discovered there is a big market in Simplicity, they say that nothing else works besides Simplicity. If your product is complex, you will fail. What's  the reality? There are tons of successful companies approaching both sides. Maybe 37signals success has nothing to do with simplicity vs. complexity (and other vague arguments found in this book).<br /><br />If you are going to read this book, my advice: be prepared to read many obvious things and to wisely filter the information you read. Don't be fooled  by the arrogant and imperative tone of Rework. Select the ideas that may work for you and don't be afraid to discard many of them.  And if you are looking for good arguments, practical examples and real foundation, buy another book.

B002PMV9FG|5.0|I am not going to scrutinize how unlike the book this movie is, because it appears that has been overdone on this site.  On its' own merit this is a very entertaining movie.  I personally like the fact that the director did not focus specifically on the dark nature of this part of the series. It was good to see a little levity i.e. Ron, Lavender and their romantic romps.  There are always risks when a beloved book series becomes a movie, but I think we just need to lighten up and let the film be.
0385732554|5.0|I discovered The Giver when I studied it for an adolescent lit class, but the message is subtle enough that an adult perspective is needed for full appreciation. At first the reader believes he is in a perfect world, but gradually awareness comes that something is very wrong. The serious thematic elements like euthanasia and infanticide are handled in a non-gratuitous manner. I made my husband read it, and he has since recommended it to friends. (The author had a specific sinister historical period in mind when she wrote it, but doesn't directly allude to it in the book. See if you can figure it out.)
1416589473|5.0|It's a great fast paced read for anyone that likes action and fantasy. And of course it's even better for those of us that are fans of The Guild Wars games. It gives all of us that are waiting for Guild Wars 2 taunting snippets of Kryta, Tyria, and beyond in the game world's future as well as key characters (and their descendants).
0670451495|5.0|This was one of the earliest picture books read to me. I liked it then and I like it now.

0199218668|5.0|I picked up this book to glean a few facts about current policing issues and found a fascinating, well written, evidenced history of policing as it spanned my adult life. I didn't read it end to end in a single sitting, but found myself returning again and again until I had read the full story. This history is clearly going to be the definitive yet accessible narrative of modern policing.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|When I first saw the preview clips for this series at the beginning of the year I thought wow this should be good. When I actually saw the first episode I was hooked, I love action and great a great story line, each episode keeps you wanting more, the hour that your watching this goes by so fast that when its over and leaves you with a cliff hanger you just wish you could slow time down to have more of it. It always leaves me drulling for the next week to come, when they said they were puttng it on dvd, I have told everyone I could that this was a step up from the movies \\"Gladitor and 300\\" I also enjoy a great body and they don't hold back on them. You have got to see this even if its just one time.
0374531269|5.0|My opinion definitely changed about war when I read A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier by Ishmael Beah.  There is a variety of different aspects of the book, including culture, relationships, unfairness, and even redemption.  His story is so sad that it really brought all my emotions out during different parts of his journey.  Beah has the perfect personally to really bring about sympathy from others.  Although the words were quite simple and not so unique, I feel that that fact makes the story better.  The simple language used in the novel gives a realistic look at a story such as Ishmael's.  A Long Way Gone kept me interested from the very beginning and had many ups and downs as far as tempo and plot go.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  The language, storyline, characters, and point of view were all just what I would have done with the story.
B002CCNC90|5.0|Al igual que a muchos lectores el libro me parece muy entretenido desde la p&aacute;gina uno, tuve la suerte de leerlo primero que \\"La sombra del viento\\", del mismo autor, y ambos se complementan de manera estupenda. Bien por Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n, es uno de mis autores favoritos en espa&ntilde;ol...<br /><br />Quisiera que hubiera un surtido m&aacute;s amplio de libros en espa&ntilde;ol.
142311339X|5.0|The book is as close to the original flavor of the Percy Jackson series. There is a perfect balance of action, drama, history, humor and mystery to make you keep turning the pages.<br /><br />Unlike the Red Pyramid, the book has familiar characters and plot line to work from, making it almost the sixth book in the series. The three new main characters are engaging and just as well rounded as the first series.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next installment. This is a really well written book.  Nothing negative at all here.
0375842381|4.0|Everyone gets all wound up about books like this.  It isn't \\"anti\\" anything.  It is a great trilogy that explores science, philosophy, religion, human nature, and world nature.  It idea that humans don't rule all OR know all.    Anyone who likes to think and imagine and enjoys a great fantasy/adventure story will love this trilogy.  Don't let anyone label you (or it) and keep you from enjoying it.    It is a must read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Nation of Panem, was once, long ago, called North America.  Panem, has one Capitol City and 12 citizen districts. Each year, all 12 districts are forced to send one boy and one girl, between the ages of twelve and eighteen, to The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games were first devised as a punishment given out by the Capitol City to its citizens for a historical rebellion.  It is a forced celebration every year; a reminder that a revolution must never be attempted again.  The rules of the game: Twenty four tributes (contestants) are imprisoned in an outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland and other unimaginable obstacles.  Over a period of several weeks, each teenager must fight to the death.  The lone survivor is declared the winner.  The whole game is played out within the confines of the controlled environment, and is televised throughout all 12 districts.  This is the ultimate in contrived reality shows.  Over the years, the greater populace becoming numb to its horror, placing bets, and staying glued to the television.<br /><br />When my 14 year old son told me about this series a few months ago, it sounded brutal. He said that I should read the books, that I'd like them.  I didn't read them, thinking that it was a young adult series that was probably terrific for him, but most likely not so much for me.  I was wrong.  The Hunger Games kept me sneaking in chapter whenever I had any extra time.  I am so looking forward to the upcoming cold forecasted weekend so I can stay indoors and read the 2nd in the series.<br /><br />I almost took one star away from my 5 star review because toward the end, I started to feel as manipulated by the author's content as the players must have felt inside, The Hunger Games. However, after a 2nd thought, I replaced the fifth star - it was really a fun book!
B004498KPU|4.0|I emailed SONY to ask if there would be a Blu-Ray release of \\"Michael Jackson's Vision\\".  Their answer was that they only had info on products on their web site and thanked me for my interest.  In other words... no answer.      I already own everything (except \\"One More Chance\\") on DVD so won't be buying this unless a 1080p version with uncompressed HD audio is released.    I'm very surprised a Blu-Ray option isn't being released day and date (as this is SONY after all), but I sure do hope a Blu-Ray edition is coming soon as that would be an absolute must own release!
031603438X|5.0|Stop reading reviews!  It's great!  Go buy it if you have any interest in music, rock n roll, blues or 60s/70s culture.<br /><br />This is a very highly recommended book by most reviews.  It far exceeded my expectations but I will add a few notes.  All autobiographies discuss early childhood.  His is non-descript but also not dwelled on too long.  Much like Lennon and McCartney, he early runs in to his soul mate, Mick Jagger and longs for a life of playing Chicago Blues Music hoping just to pay the bills.  When the Beatles explode they get a lucky break and are suddenly a hot act.  But what makes them great is their songwriting!  And it's a whim!  They weren't experienced, they were told to go write songs and it just works!  I would never have compared them to Lennon/McCartney until reading this book but I will now.  And amazingly, the songs come fast and furious without the dry spells or angst so often discussed.<br /><br />I play the guitar but not at a high level.  This book has a good section on songwriting and his secrets of open tuning and 5 string instrumentation.  This is really fascinating and in depth to hear a master talk of his methods.  Worth the price of the book right there.<br /><br />If there is a complaint I have of this book it would be concerning Brian Jones.  Ok, the mates are having problems.  But he DIED!  And the book covers it like an afterthought with no feeling.  Frankly, I found that quite cold even though he had moved on to Brian's girlfriend Anita.<br /><br />I would also add that Keith covers his drug use in a very sophisticated manner.  He doesn't recommend its use but he does a great job of explaining its appeal and why he liked it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a topnotch book.  Yes, it's lengthy, over 500 pages in hardcover (I'm using Kindle), but well worth the time commitment.

0765360969|5.0|Mistborn is an absolutely fantastic book.<br /><br />The world is unique, intriguing, and well imagined (as always with Sanderson).  The characters are an odd but fitting collection of misfits that work perfectly.  The plot is one of equal parts grave and frightening suspense and somewhat whimsical and endearing banter/interaction.<br /><br />But it is really two characters that take an otherwise 4-star book and bump it up to five.  Kelsier is a well conceived and compelling character who is just downright fun to read while Vin (from book one only) is perhaps my favorite character of all time to read save for Tyrion from A Song of Ice and Fire.  She is a uniquely quirky character that shows tremendous growth throughout the course of the book while being extremely sympathetic yet unfailingly believable at the same time.<br /><br />This should have been the first amazing book of an amazing series.  Well...one for two ain't bad.<br /><br />I would recommend Mistborn to anyone.  It is a great read and a complete story.  BUT STOP AT ONE.  The two sequels were appalling.  Everything that made the first book good (the world, the dynamics of the group, and especially the characters) are DESTROYED.  Vin loses her identity and becomes one-dimensional, wrapped up entirely in the man she supposedly \\"loves\\".  Elend because everything he was specifically NOT in the first books.  Everybody else fades into the background as some new, ill-conceived characters are introduced to force drama that would make a soap opera blush.  The drop off after Mistborn...it was staggering and appalling.  I have never EVER been so disappointed in a series and wish fervently that I could unread those two sequels.  Even now, just thinking about it makes me sick.
0596009208|5.0|This book makes learning programming fun and the teaching method is like our childhood books -- images coined from basic concepts, surrounded by phrases so that the learning sticks. Really great work by the Head First team.<br /><br />Book is not for advanced programmers. Great for those who have done C and dabbled with procedural programming and want to migrate to the OO world -- with Java. A great base for Android programming.
0765322889|5.0|Gardens of the Moon is the first book in what I have no reservations calling the BEST fantasy series currently out there.  I absolutely love the Malazan Book of the Fallen (which is now complete at ten books!).<br /><br />Yet I should warn you of the following two things:<br /><br />First, Gardens of the Moon (and the rest of the Malazan series) is far from the typical didactic fantasy books that characterizes so much of today's fantasy genre.  It can be genuinely hilarious at times (to the point where I actually laugh out loud), dark at others, and even disturbing on occasion.<br /><br />But one thing it never is: predictable.  Bad guys and good guys aren't always easy to distinguish and those 'bad guys' who can be identified tend to be competent to at least some degree and are rarely defeated just because they are craven and unable to compete with the righteous power or ingeniousness of the good guys (as so often happens with bad guys these days...see Voldemort and half a hundred other cookie cutter antagonists...spare me...been there, done that).  Nor are happy endings a given (though he did get a touch sentimental at the end...).  Even beloved characters aren't safe from page to page which makes putting the books down near impossible at times (there isn't that certainty that - \\"oh well, he's in danger but it will turn out ok since he's the hero\\").<br /><br />But above all (and my second warning) is that the books can be frustrating as hell.  Consider the decision to pick up Gardens of the Moon as a personal challenge.  You will need to pay attention while you read (and may even need to re-read certain parts) because the writing is at a nearly prohibitive level at times and there are a mind-bogglingly numerous number of characters and parallel story-lines to keep track of.  Not to mention the fact that Erikson sees no need to coddle his readers and treat them like idiots (something I appreciate to no end).  He throws you into a fully developed world and expects you to pick it up as you go (in fact, the opening sequence pretty much plants the reader into the story mid-stream where events we don't yet know about are already in motion and established characters are going about there business with little explanation as to why until much later).<br /><br />Having gotten tired of all the rote crap being cranked out these days that never engage a reader on an intellectual level, it is actually BECAUSE of all of the above that I have come to love this series.  For all the headaches, it is definitely worth the read.  Especially since Erikson is a peerless writer who has crafted some of the most memorable characters (Kruppe, Iskaral Pust, Shadowthrone, Anomander Rake, etc.) and concepts (the Deck of Dragons) that I've ever had the pleasure of reading while simultaneously creating intricate plots that are (usually) crafted together beautifully into breathtaking climaxes/conclusions (that may take place 4 or 5 books later).<br /><br />Of course there are flaws as well:<br />1. There is occasional repetitiveness from book to book<br />2. There are odd levels of inappropriate introspection displayed in some characters that is less than believable<br />3. Some of the story-lines are boring or seem to meander into nothingness...<br /><br />But the whole is always so much greater than these tiny parts which makes them easy enough to overlook (or even forgive in hindsight).<br /><br />So give Gardens of the Moon a read.  You will either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it (the latter if you are either (A) not interested in being challenged and just looking for an escape, which is understandable, or (B) dumb) but you should definitely at least give it a try.<br /><br />To end on the immortal words of Iskaral Pust, High Priest of Shadow: \\"No mule can match wits with me. Oh yes, many have tried, and almost all have failed!\\"the opening sequence pretty much plants the reader into the story mid-stream where events we don't yet know about are already in motion and established characters are going about there business with little explanation as to why until much later).

0743564413|5.0|William Hurt's reading is almost as perfect as the novel itself. The novel is beautifully rendered and if the reader has forgotten what a stunning work young Hemingway wrote, Wiliam Hurt brings every moment to life. Could not be better.

B002JVWR4U|4.0|Exactly what you would expect from creator Joss Whedon, a witty, entertaining, emotional and action packed series. It looks at the concept of what makes a person who they are.      The idea of creating a person `up-loading' it into a doll (blank slate) and then `wiping' that person once the job is done which is in effect killing that person.  This series looks at the grey area of this concept.      Would have been eager to see the show last for another season or at least fill 22 episodes for season 2. The show does wrap up all the loose ends so you will not be disappointed.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|I am enjoying the whole vampire genre on the big screen and small screen.  The Vampire Diaries is one facet of this genre.  I enjoyed Season 1 while it played out weekly on TV so I decided to buy the DVDs.  I was delighted to find deleted scenes included on the DVDs.  If you are a fan of the books or not, I have read the books and in some ways the television show surpasses the books.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Toy Story 3 is one of those rare movies that not only kids and parents but people of all ages and backgrounds can enjoy and relate to in some way. The story is brilliantly continued from where it left off, and runs the gamut of emotions more thoroughly and effectively than either of the first two movies did... and it had to, to be considered a worthy finale. I saw somebody else comment that this movie would be too scary for children under six years old. My youngest is five and she didn't find it too scary at all - her comment was she \\"liked\\" the incinerator scene because they all got out fine, and I would think most four or five year olds would view it in the same why without any issues. Now if you're talking about 2-3 year olds, they might have a more difficult time with it, but also just keeping their attention in general throughout the film could be problematic. It is a more sophisticated, in essence \\"grown up\\" Toy Story that we're talking about here, but in my experience everybody in my family absolutely loved it, ranging in ages from 5 to 50. The Blu-ray combo pack is definitely a worthy purchase for the movie itself, and the extras included make it that much more worthwhile.<br />I truly hope this is where Disney leaves the Toy Story movie franchise. It would be a shame to see them ruin this wonderful ending by forcing any more movies just for profit. Toy Story 3 ties everything together and leaves it exactly as should be.
B00007JMCX|1.0|I was the Man Who Fell Asleep while watching The Man Who Fell To Earth.  I kept thinking, I know there's a story in there somewhere, why doesn't the director just let it out? I discovered through reading other Amazon reviews that this film is indeed based upon a very good book.  Why director Roeg didn't just film the book is beyond my capacity.  Instead, we get some jumbled mish-mash of fragments and ideas, with some gratuitous nudity thrown in every five minutes. On the positive side, the acting by David Bowie was actually quite good.       I like esoteric films, and even saw the three-hour Solaris by Tarkovsky without falling asleep, but The Man Who Fell To Earth simply had too many undeveloped characters and ideas, confusing shifts in time and people's motives, and was generally an experimental film that did not succeed. Having seen other Nicolas Roeg films, I know the guy can make a great film.  With this one, he's just doing his own groovy experimental thing, and saying a big F you to the audience.

0316098337|5.0|This book is original, thrilling, captivating, and heartwrenching. At the same time, it is unexpectedly fresh and optimistic, filled with life and hope and wonder. The normal traits of a five-year-old child--curiosity, restlessness, friendliness--are all amplified by Jack's isolation. But so is the bond between him and his mother.    Despite Ma's frustrations at the limitations to raising Jack--the constant need to ration clothes and food, make sure he gets enough exercise in the tiny space, and stay sane in the face of the child's unending energy and curiosity--the love that she and Jack share shows the incomparable connection between parent and child, and attests to the power of such a bond to make even the worst situation bearable.    Donoghue has written a story that is at once haunting and uplifting, fresh yet familiar.    For a more detailed review, visit my review site, Melody and Words.

0307473708|4.0|If you can approach the book with a fresh view, divorced from your experience with the television show, then Darkly Dreaming Dexter is well worth your time. No doubt the television production has brought a good many people to the book, then they are let down due to the fact that they can't shake the image they already have in their head. This is the line a writer/creator crosses when they option their work or their idea is fully purchased and left open to production tweaks.     Remember that the book Dexter is told from the first person point of view. Dexter as a first person narrator is inherently unreliable. This makes all the difference in the world when considering the merits of the book. The internal struggles to fit in and tame the base emotion/desires is where the book casts a little more light. The book is about Dexter and his struggles. The book isn't trying to give us a snapshot of a Miami police department and proper police procedure. Remember the television production is a different point of view for much of the show and Dexter helps drive the plot forward. In the book, Dexter is the show and his struggles is what drives us forward. Of course other characters are going to be flat or even lifeless (Angel, which is one of my favorite characters on the show--is all but invisible in the book) because, remember, Dexter is telling us the story and what he tells or doesn't tell us about other characters only serves to flesh his own character out more. Why would we think a serial killer struggling to exercise self-control would care to tell us in length about others? He has nobody other than one, Deb. He's a sociopath, a narcissist. Others mean little to nothing, mere set-pieces on the stage where the camera always revolves around him. This what the book gives us, Dexter, the original--the purely envisioned monster living/working/driving next to us, or maybe even some of us.
B002ZG99CC|1.0|I watched the original Karate Kid and can honestly say it's good and I will continue to watch it when it's on TV.<br />This remake was a total waste of my time, money and energy to sit through and pay for. This remake is not as good<br />as the original and could not stand alone on it's own apart from the original.<br /><br />In this remake we have Jackie Chan who plays the teacher Mr Han and Kaden Smith playing Dre Parker. They are<br />set in beijing after Dre's mother gets transferred to a new job in China and Dre is not happy about having to move.<br /><br />Of course we already know what's going to happen, bring in the bullies and Dre gets picked on and beat up and<br />at just the right time, Mr Han saves Dre from being beat up more.<br /><br />Mr Han tries to get the bullies teacher to get the kids to leave Dre alone but the teacher is a bigger<br />bully than the kids are, now we know where they learned it from. So Dre has to either fight in the tournament<br />or the bully teacher is going to put a hurt on both Mr. Han and Dre, so Mr. Han teaches the kid how to do Kung Fu!<br /><br />That's right, it's not Karate, it's Kung Fu. This could have been called The Kung Fu Kid, but I guess they wanted<br />to use the recognizeable name and squeeze a little more money out of this franchise.<br /><br />Jaden Smith comes across like he is channeling his father in most scenes and while it's kinda cute, it also<br />shows this kid can't act and it's doubtful he will last long in Hollywood. If his parents weren't famous he wouldn't have gotten this part in the first place and his acting in this film proves that without a doubt.<br /><br />I did find it quite weird that Dre's young love interest in the movie wanted to touch his hair and when his<br />mother was around a bunch of small children at one point they all wanted to touch her hair. It seemed quite weird to me to have something like that in the film. The other thing that struck me as strange was Dre's mother never<br />questioned her son or the teacher about what they were doing spending so much time together. She did look in on him a few times, ok maybe twice but you would think they would show that his mother wanted to make sure her son was going to be safe spending so much time alone with this guy, especially when she found out her son was his only student.<br /><br />This movie could have been made into a whole different stand alone type Kung Fu movie and been good if they<br />had found a better and older actor to play the boy's part. Having these kids have a love interest at such a young age was a bit werid for this movie. It would have been better to watch if they had picked an older kid<br />who could act and didn't look like a street thug.<br /><br />I also didn't like the fact that Dre didn't even try to learn Chinese while he is now living in China. He can't<br />use chopsticks and his female love interest helps him get his food on his plate in the cafeteria.

I felt like I was there with her throughout the book.  I absolutely LOVED this book.  I do not or never had an eating disorder, but was still 100% intrigued by what I read.  I felt sad for her and was soo mad at the way she viewed herself.  It was crazy to read about such a BEAUTIFUL women, who got trapped in this horrible disease.  Finding herself and true love brought tears to my eyes.  Portia could not have been more brutally open and honest about her experience, which makes this book the most powerful book I have read.
1416594795|5.0|Award winning evolutionary biologist and popular science author Richard Dawkins meticulously constructs a scaffolding of examples plucked from the natural world in order to present evidence of evolutionary processes in action.  The range of topics is immense, spanning size dimensions from microorganisms to mega-mammals, and time scales from months to millennia. The human position on the evolutionary tree of life is proudly confirmed, and Dawkins' attack on creationism is always front and center.      In \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" Dawkins reveals to the audience a grand carousel of evolution evidence. The work is monumental in scope, inspiring in detail, and breathtaking at every turn. An enjoyable read packed with free flowing scientific information, the book displays a mastery of broad fields of knowledge not often found in popular science. Whether it is the biology of large scale speciation across the planet, the microbial evolution of bacteria within a lab, the chemistry of essential macromolecule assembly and enzymatic tools, or the physics of radioactive dating and thermodynamics, professor Dawkins provides clear and patient explanations of life's \\"smooth gradient of improvement\\". While a more timid author may tip toe delicately around the controversial aspects of the subject, Dawkins jumps in with both feet. He floods the reader with examples of animal and human cousinship, and openly addresses the biological mistakes resulting from evolutionary processes. He never shirks away from the harsh reality of natural selection, but seems to develop slight tunnel vision when showcasing his well known notion to the \\"selfish gene\\"  (Dawkins 1976) without mentioning any aspects of kin selection, or some of the modern published work on the subject (notably, Henry H. Lee, M. N.(2010, September 2). Bacterial charity work leads to population-wide resistance. Nature , pp. 82-86). However, the few examples of hand-waving are easily excused, for when he needs to lead the reader gingerly through difficult concepts, he does so carefully and politely (as when detailing Dr. Lenski's lab work with evolving tribes of E.Coli); and when he wants to take large leaps over continents and millennia to connect disparate concepts, he does so with agile grace and style (as with piecing together the fossil record). The academic seriousness of the topic is countered by a conversational tone, sprinkled with just enough British wit and cynicism to keep things lively. Full color photographs and illustrations provide stunning emphasis of the more visual topics throughout. By any measure the book is successful in filling in the author's self described \\"serious gap\\" in evolution evidence found lacking in his previous works. In doing so, its breadth and rigor rises above mere popular science and makes it a welcome addition to any biology class reading list.     Ardent fans of Dr. Dawkins will be pleased find him once again engaging in a full frontal assault on the dogmatic religious sect. The face off is announced in the early pages, and motivated by some alarming polling data showing a large percentage of Americans to be ignorant of, confused by, or in denial of the process of evolution (the full polling data is referenced in the Appendix). Unfortunately however, Dawkins seems blinded to the reality of the situation. Attempting to convince `young-earth' creationists of their folly is simply a wasted effort. They are unlikely (or rather, unwilling) to be reached by his argument, as their position is necessarily based on a premise of proof-less faith, leaving them disconnected from the scientific reasoning employed in the book. His badgering attack on these \\"history deniers\\", although executed with typical Dawkins precision, wears down the convinced reader as much as the intended victim and gives a foolish notion an unnecessarily large stage. In the tradition of his beloved Darwin, Dawkins would do well to strike a more humble tone, and let the science and evidence speak for itself.  \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" includes enough fine material on the subject to do just that. Dawkins' best avenue for success with this most recent work is to reach out to open minded youth and allow evolution to become a permanent part of their intellectual genome.

B0043GAZYS|5.0|Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a lanky, mopped-topped 20-something bassist for a Toronto garage band called Sex Bob-Omb. Scott, an unlikely heartbreaker who has a habit of going through  girlfriends like he goes through those stylish graphic t-shirts he wears, is dating 17 year-old Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) while trying to get over his previous valet, Envy Adams (Brie Larson). But Scott breaks it off with Knives when he encounters Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), deadpan Amazon delivery girl who dyes her hair a different color every week. But if Scott is to keep dating Ramona, he must defeat her seven evil exes, such as mystically powered Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha), movie star Lucas Lee (Chris Evans), superpowered vegan Todd Ingram (Brandon Routh), and music mogul Gideon Graves (Jason Schwartzman) in video game-inspired combat, all while trying to win a record deal in a Battle of the Bands competition.    Recent movie adaptations of comic books have attempted to ground themselves in realism. However, Scott Pilgrim vs The World, directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz)adapted from the Bryan Lee O'Malley's series of books, gleefully embraces the surreal elements of its source material. The books reference and utilize tropes from video games, comic books, and Japanese anime and manga, and the film also utilizes those elements with splashy effect. When characters get punched, graphics like \\"Poom!\\" and \\"K-Row!\\" pop up on screen. When a bell rings, the word \\"R-I-I-I-I-N-G!\\" flies across the screen. Characters launch into high-flying kung-fu battles while those around them look on without much shock. And when characters are defeated in battle, they burst into a pile of coins. It is one of the most literal interpretations of a comic book ever committed to film, and you could hold drinking games for all the references the film makes to popular - and not so popular - culture (The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Seinfeld, Dance Dance Revolution, just to name a few). What the film lacks in realism, it more than makes up for with sheer fun in the absurdity of it all.     It's also worth mentioning the fun array of characters brought to life by the actors portraying them. Michael Cera seems to be amounting a good fortune by playing awkward losers, so whether you like him or hate him, he fits the role rather well. And for once, his character \\"mans up\\" toward the end of the film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Ramona as a dry, aloof girl trying to escape the broken relationships of her past. Ellen Wong's Knives Chau is a hyper-emotional schoolgirl straight out of Japanese anime and manga, and Kieran Culkin steals just about every scene he's in as Wallace, Scott's \\"cool gay roommate,\\" who acts as Scott's personal peanut gallery during Scott's battles.    Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is one of the most fun, imaginative action-comedies in recent memory, and more than a worthy buy.
B00469UTUM|5.0|Having bought and reviewed Mariah's first Christmas album, I expected that this album would be a similar type of album. So it proved, as it features another mix of Christmas classics and originals that Maria co-wrote with others. Three songs from the first album re-appear here in a different form, these being Santa Claus is coming to town (this time only as a brief intro to open the album), O holy night (here as a live version) and a re-recording of All I want for Christmas is you (described as extra festive).<br /><br />The new songs that Mariah wrote for this album are Oh  Santa!, Christmas time is in the air again, When Christmas comes and One child, which are all excellent though I'll be pleasantly surprised if any of them becomes a big hit single. Indeed, maybe Mariah acknowledges that by her decision to include a new version of All I want for Christmas is you. However, I found the other original songs on Mariah's first Christmas album to be most enjoyable and the four new songs here are up to their standard.<br /><br />One obvious change from her first Christmas album is that most of the Christmas classics are paired in medleys, but being only two-song medleys, you hear plenty of each featured song. However Charlie Brown Christmas (rarely recorded) and Auld Lang Syne appear in full on their own.<br /><br />This album is unlikely to change anybody's mind about Mariah Carey, but she has plenty of fans around the world is this album is clearly for them first and foremost. I am not a diehard fan of Mariah's, but I do appreciate her ability as singer, as songwriter and as an interpreter of other people's songs. I have no hesitation in recommending this album to anybody who also enjoys at least some of her earlier music.
0757302661|4.0|During my last pregnancy, I explored several books that could help me learn to trust my body and give birth naturally. One of the avenues that I explored was hypnosis for childbirth. I purchased this book out of curiosity and I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Hypnobirthing the Mongan Method by Marie F. Mongan is an instructional book on relaxation, visualization, and breathing techniques for labor and birth. It covers positioning for labor and birth, as well as some new concepts for birth that many other childbirth books do not address. For instance, instead of \\"contractions\\" the words \\"rushes\\" or \\"surges\\" are used; Instead of pushing your baby out it is recommended that you \\"breath your baby down\\".<br /><br />The thing that I enjoyed most about this book is it's support for a woman's choices and natural birth methods. It explains how fear affects labor and then takes you through a guided process to get rid of the fear and start trusting your body's ability to give birth. This book is not intended to give any kind of medical advice or information, but instead supports a woman's ability to gain her own knowledge and make the choice that is right for her and her baby.<br /><br />Ideally, I would recommend taking a Hypnobirthing class if you want to do the full in-depth study of this method. I was unable to take a class for various reasons and I will admit that there were some breathing concepts that I was unable to understand based solely on the book. Although this book usually comes with a basic relaxation CD, I did also purchase and recommend the Rainbow Relaxation CD which can be found on their website. It's a great companion to the book and required for the class. This book is still a great read even if you can't attend the class or buy any extra CDs.<br /><br />I'm no expert, but I would not describe this as a method of hypnosis. To me, it is more of a guided relaxation and imagery method. All of the hypnosis for childbirth methods seem to be set up that way.<br /><br />There is some confusion about hypnobirthing methods that they guarantee a pain-free childbirth experience. Hypnobirthing the Mongan Method states clearly that it doesn't promise a painless birth. That being said, I wouldn't describe my birth as painful at all; I can not give this method all of the praise, but it definitely helped with my relaxation and frame of mind.<br /><br />Overall, this book is not for everyone. It is for any woman who has an open mind and would like to explore hypnosis methods for childbirth. If you want to learn how to trust your body to give birth and are open to the possibility of an enjoyable childbirth, this book is for you.<br /><br />Originally published at NaturalFamilyToday.com.<br /><br />There is some confusion about hypnobirthing methods that they guarantee a pain-free childbirth experience.

1439133948|3.0|Speaking as someone who loves, loves, loves (and re-reads) all the Miles books --(I was sooo excited to recieve this book) I am sorry to say how dissapointed I was. I just finished it *sigh* - I found more drama in the last few pages than the rest of the book.   My attention kept drifting...I wasn't dazzled by the kids, or Roic, or the plot (which for me just limped along) I was just a bit bored by it all..  But, even after saying that - I was so happy to return to \\"Miles' world\\" and I'd love it if Bujold wrote another one..I'd buy it again - even if it was called \\"Miles goes to Walmart\\" or \\"Miles picks belly-button lint\\" or...  So for anyone new to this series, start at the beggining - you'll fall in love with them  and eventually you'll buy Cryoburn, too
B003UYV08E|4.0|I read some mixed reviews on here and I don't get some of the negative reviews, I have to say this movie is just as good as the original with better action and special effects, alot better than transformers 2, better story and cool looking robots. entertaining and fun.

B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was an aristocrat from an ancient, inbred family who grew up to be a dwarf because of childhood leg accidents and one of France's great Impressionist painters. Moulin Rouge (1952) is John Huston's tribute to the artist (he wrote and directed this film), which brings vividly to life the Paris of the 1890s and especially the famous Moulin Rouge of the period, complete with amazingly faithful recreations of the music hall's characters that Lautrec immortalized in his paintings and that seem to have jumped right out of the artist's canvas. Poor Lautrec, whose only comfort came prostitutes, who died early of alcoholism, had a short, unhappy life, but his art was his triumph. There's an indelible scene in this movie that points up the artist's, any artist's, almost impersonal drive. In it Lautrec, after the prostitute he's rescued off the street leaves him in misery, he closes the windows in his apartment, turns on the gas, and sits down to wait for death. Idly staring at an unfinished painting, he abruptly gets up and adds a brush stoke. Then another. And then stroke after brush stroke while in his excitement and never leaving the canvas he reaches for the windows and closes them, reaches for the gas and shuts it off. It's a scene so right and so life-affirming, it raises one's neck hair.
B001DHXT6G|1.0|Based on Amazon's prices as of 11/15/10, its about 60 dollars cheaper to buy each Remastered season individually then buying this 3 pack. Just an FYI for those of you that like to save money...
0451205766|5.0|I stumbled upon this book by chance when I was at the local Salvation Army shopping for handkerchiefs. I think it would be great to see a film adaptation of it. In fact, I just spent my entire life savings on screenwriting classes so that I can be the one to turn this awesome book into a film. I just pray nobody beats me to it. I'm hoping that Denzel Washington plays the role of Don Vito Corleone. I think he'd be perfect for it and I'm writing the part with him in mind.

0316069485|4.0|This is pretty much your standard Connelly novel. Like with almost all of them, it's a real page-turner. The good thing about that is that you won't realize until you're done with it that it didn't do anything particularly special. Looking at Bosch/Haller team-ups, The Brass Verdict was a better novel than this in almost every way. This isn't bad at all, though. There's a lot of suspense, there's some criminal investigating in there for good measure, and the courtroom drama is entertaining. Again, not the best Connelly's written, but a fun ride.     I would like to see Connelly write another solo Harry Bosch novel, though...and I mean one that's more in the traditional \\"Harry Bosch\\" style, not the \\"thriller\\" style of 9 Dragons and The Overlook.

0061997811|5.0|This is an AMAZING book. I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I read the first book about a month after it came out and I haven't waited that long to read a HP book or watch an HP movie since. This book is the perfect compliment to Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 coming up. With the excitement for the new movie, and no new chapters in the series to get our hands on, this is the key to getting through your Potter addiction.  Each page has exquisite detail and enough content to last you months, if not longer. It definitely could use re-reads as well. Even just looking at all of the amazing pictures, on set and otherwise, is good enough! It also comes with a few extras: a Maraurder's Map, a Weasley's Wizard Wheezes Catalog, and a sticker book with high-quality potions stickers just to name a few.  If you are a fan of the movies, the books, or both, this book is basically a necessity.  Hope this was helpful!  Enjoy!  *KNOX*
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I knew this album was going to be a bit different for Josh, as he parted ways with producer David Foster (Celine Dion, Barbara Streisand) and hooked up with legendary rock producer Rick Rubin (Metallica, Slayer, Red Hot Chili Peppers). I didn't quite know what to expect, because Josh doesn't really have a rock kind of voice.  With trepidation, I played the first song...and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />This album IS different than his previous outings, but that's not a bad thing. The songs don't have that \\"over-produced\\" sound, with lots of vocal reverb and bounding orchestrations and vocals in the background.  Many of these songs are just Josh, a piano, and the occasional subtle violin or guitar in the background. No backing vocals, no blazing productions, just Josh, and his amazing voice. You can even hear the slight imperfections in his voice, and even though subtle, provide for a very real experience by a very talented individual.<br /><br />Josh wrote or co-wrote most of the songs on this album, thus why most are in english. But the non-english songs are fantastic! Very flowy, musical, and very, very good. There actually isn't a single bad song on this album, but highlights include \\"Hidden Away\\", \\"Au Jardin Des Sans-Pourquoi\\", \\"Bells of New York City\\", and the phenomenal \\"Higher Window\\", which was so good it may make you cry.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album!

0393072231|4.0|A very comprehensive but understandable narrative about Wall Street's catastrophic investment in \\"subprime mortgages\\" (i.e., home loans to people who couldn't pay them back) leading to the economic meltdown of 2008. It's a bit dry at times, but Lewis explains everything clearly and soon you'll be following along as he discusses Mezzanine CDOs and all the other arcane financial terms brokers and traders use to deceive (yes, deliberately deceive) investors.<br /><br />Greed and deceit on Wall Street? Shocking! No, but really, the problem as Lewis explains it is not that Wall Street is greedy and dishonest but that most of the people on Wall Street don't actually know what they're doing. You'd think guys put in charge of handling billions of dollars would take the time to research their investments. Even if they don't care about screwing the public, they don't really want to bring down the entire economy. Yet that's exactly what they did, because they were lazy and ignorant. Even the CEOs.<br /><br />If your understanding of the implosion of the housing market and the economy is kind of vague and you want to know the details, this is a very good book to start educating yourself with. Of course Lewis tells the story from his own viewpoint, and some of his opinions are not shared universally, so this isn't necessarily the definitive book on the subject.<br /><br />He populates the book with an interesting cast of characters, not necessarily the biggest names in the catastrophe, but the little guys who made a killing seeing what the big investment banks didn't: that Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers were holding billions of dollars of bad paper. It almost makes you believe that you could make a killing on Wall Street if you were willing to put in the time and the study -- and if you were willing to hold on for a white-knuckle ride while everyone else is telling you you're about to lose your pants.
0596806027|4.0|This book is a guide to the new features in HTML5. It is suitable for anywho who is somewhat familiar with HTML. After reading chapter 2 and 3, readers will have a general idea about the new features in HTML5. Each subsequent chapter is devoted to explaining in detail these features which includes drawing on canvas, playing video, geolocation, storage, offline web application, new form input, and microdata.    This book is informative and enjoyable to read. I worked with HTML in the mid 90's. This book answers my curiosity to what happened to HTML.    The book is well organized. Chapters detailing specific features are self contained allowing me to skip to features that interest me most.    I find the author methodical in his discourse. Key points are made clearly. Introductory statements such as \\"HTML5 is not one big thing; it is a collection of individual features\\" and \\"Microdata annotates the DOM with scoped name/value pairs ...\\" put me in the right mind set to follow the material. In addition, the right amount of background information is provided for readers to use the new features properly. The summary on video encoding and file format is one such example.    Throughout the book, there are useful links to tools, standards and other interesting references.    The only downside of this book is that the author can be tedious at times. I feel that chapter 2 and the examples in chapter 10 can be condensed as they are repetitive.    See :  [...]

0316077054|4.0|It begins at Macon's funeral and you can already see Lena is pulling away from Ethan, especially when an unexpected guy walks up to Lena and gives her a tiny sparrow. As Lena pulls away and starts to severe her connection with Ethan, Ethan will do anything to get Lena back. But, it seems like Lena is starting to sway towards the dark side by hanging out with Ridley and John Breed, the guy from the funeral. And as Lena makes an new guy friend, Ethan also makes a new girl friend Liv. Seems like Ethan has a thing for friends that have \\"L\\" name.<br /><br />******May be some spoilers*****<br />I did see a couple inconsistencies in the book. Ethan points out that Liv has probably only seen Blood Incubus in one of her caster volumes when they are confronted by Hunting and his gang. But, didn't Liv see Incubus at Exile earlier in the book in the tunnels when they were 1st looking for Lena?<br /><br />Also, in the first book and this book it is mentioned many times that you can only go into the Lunae Libri during holidays when the regular library is closed, and no other days. And, they have to stick to the hours or they would get stuck in the Lunae Libri and they didn't know how a human would coup being stuck in there. But, in the descriptions the Lunae Libri seems to branch out into the tunnels with no boundary from the tunnels. So, how could they get stuck if they could just walk down another tunnel and open up a door way? Unless I am mistaken, but it seems like the Lunae Libri has no end and goes straight into the tunnels so how can it close if they can go into the tunnels whenever they please?<br /><br />Also, Lena lives with Reece, so why didn't she go to Reece for help instead of Ridley? She said Ridley was the only one to help but Reece could help too? Maybe it is was because Lena only grew up with Ridley and not Reece so they weren't as close?<br /><br />It kind of bothered me when Ethan would get saved just in the nick of time by Amma, Ridley, Aunt Prue, Leah. They would just pop out of the middle of nowhere. Yeah, Ethan questioned it each time and it was answered but it still seemed odd<br /><br />But, even with the inconsistencies I still enjoyed the book. Last book had Boo, this book at Lucille who has a great personality. I also enjoy Links character with his manly garden shears that can open up caster tunnel doors. And Liv, I could hear her accent while I read. A lot of my questions were asked, like why did only two died at the end instead of all the dark casters when Lena chose. Did Lena get a new name? Where did Lucille always run off too.<br /><br />In the next book, I hope Ridley turns good and gets some good powers I like her character.nowhere.

B002VECM6S|4.0|What a pleasant surprise this movie was. Sandra Bullock shows unexpected depths as a middle class white woman who on the spur of the moment takes into her home and her heart a gentle African American teenager abandoned by his family. If you think this movie is about football, think again. Football is merely the peg for a true story that shows all that is best in the American spirit. Read the other 450 reviews for a description of what happens. It's not important. All you need to know is that if you are looking for a well-acted, bighearted and genuinely uplifting movie, look no futher.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|If in fact that there was a negative column to rate this book thats where I personally would rate it. However I did learn one valuable thing after buying this book. I will take the advice of all the people who write reviews to Amazon over Oprahs book club. I have purchased approximately 30 plus books from Amazon and I have found that if in doubt read 3-4 reviews from the people who have written reviews about what I intend to buy. It has paid off handsomely for me. Now to rate this book -5. Enough said.
0061914177|1.0|I was very excited to read this book after reading so many glowing reviews.  Unfortunately I found this book to be a completely uninspiring waste of paper and time.  As someone trying to make a living with my passion this book contained nothing new whatsoever.  Don't waste your money.  Most of the book is the author talking about how great and brilliant he is.
B002XTBE8I|3.0|These were real good when I first got it but they have faded in the few years since. Six songs produced by Dre and one by Eminem. It's part 'Slim Shady' character and part Eminem the rapper. I think the main reason this EP was released was due to the sucess of the collab song with Drake, Kanye and Wayne. In addition to that one, three of the songs are real good (Buffalo Bill, Taking my Ball and track 4 (produced by Em).
1427209758|5.0|This is a pretty decent book.  I believe Brandon Sanderson is really comming into being one of the great writers of our time here.  Though the sequel will most definetly be put on hold due to him being assigned to write the last 3 books of the late Mr. Robert Jordans Eye of the World series, I will definetly be keeping my eye out for the second book in this series as I believe probably like most that this story is far from over and will continue to interest and captivate us.  As for the product and the delivery.  Both were awesome.  I recieved a great product at a fair price and the delivery was well within time.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|When news first broke that Mariah Carey would be working on a Christmas album, scowls were formed with fans thinking \\"how dare you try to top perfection.\\" The original album, Merry Christmas, is widely said to be the most successful of holiday albums in history. Instead she brought the type of record that fans have been waiting for years to hear. After achieving the most number ones hits of any living artist and having the Billboard Song of the Decade for the 2000s her career and voice have come under a lot of scrutiny lately especially with Whitney working on a return. She has proven her detractors wrong again with a record strong enough to rival her first Christmas album from 16 years ago that has topped the charts every year since.    As the executive producer, she has decided to work with long time record executive friend L.A. Reid who helped helm her 2005 comeback as well as Jermaine Dupri who she first worked with on `Always Be My Baby' and Randy Jackson who has been her bass guitar player since the early 90s. Randy introduced her to music composer Marc Shaiman who has worked in television, music and film. Keeping in the same vein as the original Mariah made it aware that this album will be a classic that can be played during the holidays without pinpointing it being from 2010. Unlike many artists who try to make their holiday records sound like their current work, this strategy has allowed Mariah to have 16 years of holiday hits. No matter how her current music is doing every year she is always guaranteed a hit during Christmas.    What makes this record so special in 2010 is though Mariah has had many urban hits over the years, there are many who believe she has been singing the wrong type of music. It is when she sings songs that allows her to actually open up and really sing does she sound the best. This is a record that is not trying too hard to be hip but remains true to herself and it shows with each song.     The album's lead single `Oh Santa' is already topping the Holiday Charts at number one with her classic `All I Want for Christmas Is You' at number two. The album's high note literally comes with her duet with her opera singer mother Patricia Carey whom she has always cited as a big influence in her vocal styling. After years of a rumored duet it finally came to fruition with a result sure to take you by surprise.    Stay tuned this weekend as her holiday TV special, Mariah Carey: Merry Christmas to You is recorded to air on ABC December 13th. Also don't expect her to go off into hiding just because she's pregnant; more so the exact opposite. Her husband, `America's Got Talent' host Nick Cannon says that getting her to not work is impossible. With an HSN line in the works she'll be keeping the creative juices flowing.    Finally maturing with a baby on the way and her second album in the row with more adult material sounding in excellent vocal form rivaling her early days, times are looking good for Mariah.

0312243022|4.0|My reading habits are to learn of a classic, or contemporary prize winner and then read it, hoping I might encourage my own senses by following the masters, or those we acclaim as such.<br /><br />On starting The Hours, I initially wanted not to like it, for finding its present-perfect tense too annoying. But on finishing, I feel this Cunningham work deserves its praise. It's not about Virginia Wolfe, as the Wolfe lovers might complain.
B003UBTX72|3.0|Being a Stones fan for years, I was interested in this book. What I have found is that the reading is a bit tedious and slow going as Mr. Richards bounces around from year to year and event to event. I find it a slow read, but nevertheless, facinating.  Right now, I'm only half way throught it and find myself picking it up and putting back down for a few days. This is not what you would call a \\"page turner\\" but, still, not bad for its historical and cultural view point.
0441018866|4.0|My decadal Reynolds novel - I've read nearly everything he's written so you could easily say I'm a fan having read all short of Pushing Ice and Terminal World. House of Suns is written in a similar style to his Revelation Space series. Even the book's format and cover are reminiscent of that great series. One can almost begin to draw parallels between the two plots.<br /><br />With standard modern British pessimistic visions of the future, Reynolds sets this novel in the Milky Way galaxy where humans are the sole inhabitants, which reflects that idea that unique life forms are exceedingly rare and intelligent life forms only crop up possibly once ever billion years, give or take. It's not a line of thought that is easy to subscribe to, it almost makes humans look either like freaks or miracles.<br /><br />The humans in House of Suns who widely inhabit the Milky Way galaxy are often wildly unique and far-flung. The only thing to bind these sects of humanity together is the Lines of information traders who hoard and exchange information to various levels of civilizations. Maintaining a stasis or cryonic slumber during the numerous stellar bound sojourns, the solitary member of each starship preserves their youth through relativistic time dilation. Got that?<br /><br />It's an epic novel which awes the reader in the first hundred pages. It's absolutely fantastic but the steam Reynolds produces cannot continue as the plot must eventually gain its own momentum and sap power from the great sense of wonder. When the plot was once a space bound trading fleet experiencing great diversity, eventually the same plot takes a terrestrial base and slows the wonder train down a few notches. Even though the backdrop takes a downshift quite abruptly, Reynolds shows his talent by sustaining a decent plot design and continues a positive build-up of suspense and mystery revolving around the Gentian's distress signal, the Absence in Andromeda and the special-case, non-human Machine People.<br /><br />There is a perpetual peculiarity among some of the characters which rubs me the wrong way. When the plot takes a terra firma setting, the terrestrial Protectors retain a snippy attitude towards the ill-stuck Gentian Line. Also, one of main protagonists, Purslane, has a never ending line of questions at the most inappropriate moments, which just seems to kill time during passages and allows the greater evil to take a firmer grip upon their own conniving schemes. At some times the characters reveal themselves to be uni-faceted when all you want to do is go back to lose yourself in the wonder.<br /><br />While reading to the one-hundredth page, two-hundredth page and beyond, the conclusion to the novel is as nebulous as the cosmos itself. I found this uncertainty comforting as most pulp novels have an ending which comes as no surprise to the intelligent, focused reader. However, when the finale came about, I felt a profound lackluster sense of effort on Reynolds' part. He brought it fantastically so far in 470 pages or so but left me hanging with the complaint, \\"Really? That's it? Icosahedrons, and tetrahedrons... is that the best you can do Reynolds?\\"<br /><br />So many fantastic facets are etched into this novel that it cold have easier have stretched itself into another trilogy like Revelation Space. Reynolds gave us a condensed version which perhaps should have been expanded to encompass its true brilliance of information trade, human diversification and the lingering mystery in Andromeda. Withholding the eccentric penning of the novel Century Rain (3/5), I must say that Alastair Reynolds (like Iain Banks) can do no wrong.tual peculiarity among some of the characters which rubs me the wrong way.

And, the price was a little bit to high. But overall it is really great and I recommend it to everyone

B000ULQV0W|5.0|great lyrics and music.  The cover of Hard Sun was better than the original in my opinion.  every time a song ends I want to skip back but the next one is great also. I can listen to this over and over. There are at least 2 songs on here that I want played at my funeral.

B001VNB54A|5.0|The blu ray version of this just looks awesome. The movie is based on real marines like the truly great John Basilone , he sets a standard that marines still look up to, but with all modern war flicks we do get two many scenes of people going nuts. Sure this happens but you only had ten hours here to compress several biograaphy books into a whole. However the pacific was savage on a whole other level with the japanese desire to take as many people with them making the marines view them as monsters that were no longer human.  That is the fact of this situation which does get some play with mothers and babys strapped with bombs coming at the poor marines. Ok, this still shows how serving in some of the battles of the pacific that the survival rate was not so good. But beyond that you get a good feeling of the suffering and heartbreak that these men endured. They really suffered beyong the limits of human endurance and so did the really tough japanese soldiers. It is forgotten though that the japanese empire had become under tojo,  a genocidal war machine bent on mass slaughter and the marines were not there for the same purposes , if the japanese had surrendered and not behaved the way they did then the whole thing wouldn't have been tipped into the horror it was.  One thing that this movie slides over is the fact that japanese slaughtered tons of civilians , however these flick cover the fighting on remote islands so we don't get that perspective.  This is worth seeing on many levels and the acting is superb from the whole cast who were  really dedicated to this project. It's a major achievement in some ways but it's not perfect. The backstories are not boring either they are very real and to the point.  The print looks great on this and you could do worse than own this blu ray set.
0312427999|5.0|Naomi Klein has written an essential book that examines the ideological origins, and the methods of implementation, of the ideas which have been central to the global economic transformation of the last 40 years, which is often associated with terms such as \\"globalization,\\" \\"free trade,\\" and \\"unfettered free market capitalism.\\" It is an immense and complex subject, and whose eyes do not begin to glaze over when the subject of GATT, or WTO talks is raised, but Klein has done a most impressive job of offering the reader an erudite and lucid exposition of this transformation. She has meticulously researched the subject, and has coupled that with interviews of some key actors in the transformational events. The book is accompanied by 75 pages of footnotes, a few of which I verified for accuracy.<br /><br />Klein starts her work in an unlikely place: the basement of the Allan Memorial Institute at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. It was there in the 1950's that Dr. Ewen Cameron, an American who was one time was president of the American Psychiatric Association, conducted experiments which were eventually funded by the CIA, on mentally-ill, and not so mentally-ill patients. Klein's interview with one of the survivors of Cameron's experiments was truly horrifying. Purportedly the CIA was funding such experiments \\"for a good cause,\\" that is, to help captured American soldiers survive \\"brainwashing,\\" which were conducted during the Korean War. In actuality, the CIA was to adopt many of the techniques that Cameron pioneered in its efforts to maintain \\"friendly\\" regimes throughout what was once called the Third World. The pictures of prisoners at Gitmo, with ear-mufflers and thick gloves, all in an effort to reduce sensory stimulus, are a direct result of Cameron's work. Electroshock therapy was also a central Cameron technique, and Klein uses an incisive epigraph from Ernest Hemingway, shortly before his suicide: \\"Well, what is the sense of ruining my head and erasing my memory, which is my capital, and putting me out of business? It was a brilliant cure but we lost the patient.\\"  Yes, the critical point is that none of this worked, despite all the pain inflicted.<br /><br />The central theme of the book is about what Klein calls \\"the other doctor shock.\\" She is referring to Milton Friedman, and the school of economic thought known as the Chicago school (since Friedman taught at the University of Chicago), with its three part formula of: deregulation, privatization and cutbacks. He has been one of the stellar and most successful proponents of the now all too widely accepted \\"government is bad; free markets are the best of all possible worlds\\" thesis.  And he doesn't believe in gradual transformation; it must be traumatic in order to overcome \\"political\\" obstacles, which is shorthand for the will of the vast majority of the people, who will be harmed by his policies. Klein does not particularly make this point, but I kept thinking, is not what she is describing the flip side of Communism? A rigid ideology, promoted by devoted and unquestioning acolytes who deem deviation from the \\"party line\\" heresy, requiring a revolution to obtain its objectives, and which involves much short-term immediate pain coupled with a promise of a better life in the hazy future.<br /><br />Klein devotes chapter after chapter in a veritable \\"tour-de-force\\" of the implementation of the Chicago school's economic policies. Each chapter is a brilliant summation of the transformational events in a number of countries throughout the world. Friedman's first chance to implement his \\"clean slate\\" policies was Chile, when the CIA overthrew the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende, and imposed General Pinochet's reign of terror on the country in 1973. For the Chicago school, the implementation of its policies must be made through non-democratic means, and usually accompanied by violence; a point Klein makes again and again. As Thomas Frank says in his [[ASIN:080507774X What's the Matter with Kansas?: How Conservatives Won the Heart of America]], it is the French revolution in reverse, with economic wealth becoming concentrated, the few reaping vast rewards, the vast majority losing. That objective is not accomplished democratically. Klein goes on to detail the implementation of these polices in the other countries of what she calls the \\"southern cone,\\" that is, Argentina, Uruguay, and Bolivia. She again selects a wonderful epigraph by Eduardo Galeano: \\"People were in prison so that prices could be free.\\"<br /><br />In the `80's, a partial implementation of Friedman's policies occurred in both the United States and Britain, under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher's policies were so unpopular with the electorate that she was sure to lose the election, but the \\"foreign adventure,\\" the last gasp of empire jingoism, the Falklands War bailed her out. The author says that next step in the global transformation occurred with: \\"the colonization of the World Bank and the IMF by the Chicago School was a largely unspoken process, but it became official in 1989 when John Williamson unveiled what he called `the Washington Consensus'\\". The policies were thereby exported to Poland, Russia, and South Africa, each receiving its own chapter. The betrayal of the stated goals of the African National Congress, and the acceptance of the previous debt by the black-majority government, was particularly heart-breaking. The standard technique is to claim that the economic policies are not political, but technically and scientifically objective. Natural disasters, such as Katrina in New Orleans, and the tsunami in Sri Lanka, are likewise viewed as `opportunities' to \\"shock\\" the populace into accepting Chicago School doctrines, such as school privatization and fancy beach resorts. Klein also covers the economic \\"homeland security bubble\\" in the States, and does a brilliant job describing how these same policies were implemented in Iraq, a country with intermittent electric and water supplies, but a 15% flat tax rate was implemented, and constitutional changes were made so that it would be hard to reverse the \\"free market\\" policies, including selling off their oil reserves. The last chapter is devoted to the increasing resistance developing to such policies. Her book was completed prior to the economic melt-down in the United States in 2008, so, no doubt, it is greater now, but the political implementation of that discontent is still held in abeyance.<br /><br />Klein's book has garnered numerous 1-star reviews; I've read them all, and could find very little of merit. Mainly they were the standard attacks from true-believer acolytes of the \\"magic\\" of the markets, despite the evidence, in particular of the last two years.

B002ZG9968|3.0|I rented this movie from my local redbox machine. It looked like a nice film when it was advertised in the theaters. I don't go to the movies beause it's to expensive , so I wait until I can rent them. This movie was average I didn't not see what the fuss was about. The scene when the mother was having a baby in the water pool was also disturbing, and could have been left out. The story line could have been better as well.
B003EYVXXW|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />With Agora, Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar has taken on a subject that has not been done before in the movies: the story of Hypatia, 4th century Alexandrian astronomer-philosopher, a woman way ahead of her time. Little is known about the historical Hypatia so Amenabar also depicts the political situation in Alexandria: the internecine struggle between a besieged Roman pagan culture and ascendant Christians. A fantastic set was constructed on the island of Malta along with digital effects added later on that recreates ancient Alexandria. Coupled with some excellent work on the part of the film's costume designer, the result is an impressive verisimilitude. Quibblers might object to the use of candles and glass windows but as the director points out in a special features DVD interview, there is considerable disagreement amongst historians as to whether those and other materials were in use at that particular period in history.<br /><br />Amenabar's main problem is that his protagonist is for the most part not an active agent in the external arc of the story. It's established early on that she rejects the love interests of both Davus, her soon to be freed slave and convert to Christianity and Orestes, the pagan nobleman who later becomes the prefect of Alexandria. In a scene based on a true story, she hands Orestes (at the beginning of the film, a student of Hypatia), a handkerchief soaked with blood from her menstrual cycle and makes it clear that she has no interest in future sexual relationships. Her interest is furthering her career in philosophy and astronomy. The focus thus is on Hypatia's internal arc, as she struggles to replace Ptolemy's erroneous geocentric conception of the universe with a heliocentric model. Amenabar informs us that he wanted 'Agora' to be, in part, a tribute to astronomy and physics. This is unfortunate because the many scenes that focus on Hypatia totally lack suspense. We KNOW basically that she'll come up with the right answer in regards to her astronomical quandaries, so no matter how many circles are drawn in the sand, the viewer is reminded more of a History Channel documentary than scenes from a flesh and blood drama.<br /><br />In contrast to most Biblical epics, Amendabar turns his Christians into the bad guys and now the Pagans, represented by the rational and humanistic Hypatia, are the enlightened. The Christians become stand-ins for today's fundamentalists. We learn from the DVD documentary that the costume designer based the costumes of the Parabalani (the Christian Brotherhood who are depicted here as bad guy enforcers for the local Patriarch) on the Taliban. Amendabar intentionally has the Christians all dressed in a dark gray and the pagans in white.<br /><br />Amendabar claims that the film is not meant to be anti-Christian and he emphasizes that the violence in the opening scenes is clearly instigated by the pagans. On the other hand, the Christians' rising militancy is ably depicted in the character of Ammonius who challenges a pagan to walk over some burning coals (this supposedly was based on a true story). When the pagan hesitates, the crowd throws him into the fire and he's almost burned to death. Amendabar then awkwardly inserts a scene that's designed to depict the 'good' side of the Christian mission--the soldiers are directed to give bread to the poor. But it's not enough--before you know it, the 'fundamentalist' Christians are throwing Jews out the windows of their apartments (a la Schindler's List) and stoning poor Hypatia to death much in the manner of today's Tablian. Despite his claims to the contrary, Amendabar appears to take some satisfaction in having his Christians get their comeuppance. He even has \\"Saint\\" Cyril, the bad guy Alexandrian Patriarch, read an misogynistic passage from the Book of Timothy as a prelude to his order that Hypatia renounce her 'faith'.<br /><br />Given all the sappy pro-Christian Biblical epics we've had to endure over the years, a corrective in the other direction might not be such a bad thing after all. Amendabar has provided a service in depicting true historical events where once oppressed Christians now attain power and become as bad as their former pagan oppressors. But that's really all Amendabar has provided: a history lesson! I think what's missing is some basic character development. Somehow I have the feeling that Cyril was a little more complicated than the sinister Fundamentalist stand-in depicted here.<br /><br />Amendabar fails to rise above hagiography in his telling of the Hypatia story. The short scene where she reminds Davus that he's still a slave during the pagan evacuation of the city is not enough to humanize his protagonist. Amendabar ends up being just as guilty as the Christians he derides when he turns Hypatia into a martyr of western rationalism. Even the 'good' Christians are ineffectual or downright hypocritical. Spineless Orestes falls to his knees in front of Synesius, symbolizing the complete capitulation of the pagan world to Christianity and Synesius can only mumble platitudes about God as he basically condones Hypatia's death sentence.<br /><br />In the end, science and 'reason' are Amendabar's good guys and promoters of 'faith' are the bad guys. The virtually all virtuous Hypatia stands in stark relief to the world's religions which are blamed for the spread of fundamentalism. 4th Century Christians are not only stand-ins for modern day Islamic fundamentalists but the basic tenets of Christianity, based on an anti-Semitic creed, is linked to the horrors of the Holocaust. Even the Jews (albeit seen less culpable here than the Christians and the Muslims) commit atrocities in the name of religion.<br /><br />Amendabar still manages to show restraint in some scenes. Particularly admirable is that he protects his audience from experiencing the full horror of Hypatia's execution (in history she's skinned alive; here, Davus, her former slave, suffocates her in order to prevent her further suffering).<br /><br />Agora is good as a basic history lesson. But its simplistic depiction of the supremacy of reason over religious fundamentalism doesn't ring quite true.he years, a corrective in the other direction might not be such a bad thing after all.

B0044XV3QY|4.0|First off, yes, we have the discs in hand early so this review is based on hands-on experience, not on speculation nor on a general dissatisfaction with studios who feel compelled to \\"double dip\\" on major titles like this.  I'm as averse to double dips as the next guy and have frequently called out studios who put out multiple releases of a movie in order to squeeze every last drop out of the fans.  But there are a few reasons why this particular double dip may be worthy of your high def dollars.<br /><br />The extended versions of the film (as with Cameron's other SciFi epics, \\"The Abyss\\" and \\"Aliens\\" before it) really enhance one's enjoyment of the film.  If you like being immersed in Pandora, these extra sixteen minutes dealing with such sub-plots as the failed school project (only hinted at in the theatrical version) give you a little more time in this beautiful world and lend further depth to the characters.  The extra scenes better illustrate the efforts that some humans have put into trying to understand and respect the beliefs and wishes of the Na'vi - maybe even enrich their lives through broadened horizons.  This brings further contrast to the insensitive company men (and women) who are just trying to figure out how to get the Na'vi out of the way so they can exploit the planet's natural resources.  These extra scenes took so long and so much computing resources to render and complete that they simply were not ready in time for the earlier Blu-ray release.  The extra scenes are incorporated into the film cleanly using Blu-ray's seamless branching feature.  You choose which version to watch and it runs through the theatrical, extended or collector's edition cuts.  Or you can also choose to just jump to the new and expanded bits if you'd prefer.<br /><br />We did notice some mild differences in the noise level and black level reproduction in the newest scenes (the scenes added for the Collector's Edition cut).  There was nothing to draw major attention to the new material but you may spot subtle quality differences in the new scenes if watching closely.  Overall, it is still a stunning transfer, even blown up on a 100-inch projection screen, with rich details and nicely saturated colors.  Pandora is a colorful world and Blu-ray is the only way to watch it.  The sound is as impressive as the audio, with a DTS-HD Master Audio track that captures the organic environmental sounds of Pandora, the dialog (Na'vi and human), as well as the massive explosions and percussive attack of mortar fire and automatic weapons.  New scenes such as a shot of the abandoned school, blend transparently with old as far as the audio is concerned with a stable and immersive soundscape throughout.<br /><br />Also, a new \\"family-friendly\\" soundtrack is offered which omits the fairly plentiful profanity from the mix.  This is offered for the theatrical and extended cuts only (not the Collector's Edition cut). Although I've never been a fan of censorship, I do like knowing that I can play this for my young son without fear of exposing him to excessively \\"colorful\\" language.  Plus the track was created in cooperation with the director, so we know it doesn't stray too far from his vision.  Unfortunately, probably due to space considerations, this track is plain old lossy Dolby Digital 5.1, but after watching it with the family, I can say that much of the quality and dynamics of the lossless mix are carried over here.<br /><br />In the extras department, this set is unlikely to disappoint the fans and those who are simply curious as to how some of the more impressive aspects of the film (like the performance captures of human actors playing Na'vi) were accomplished.  Other than the omission of any kind of running commentary track during the film (which would have been nice), you'll find just about everything you could hope for on the making of the film, including even *MORE* deleted and extended scenes that were left out for pacing or logistical reasons.  The 28 deleted scenes are on disc two, combining over 45 minutes of new footage with enough transitional scenes to total up to just over 68 minutes running time. Continuing on discs two and three, you'll find various behind the scenes and Making Of segments, screen tests and initial performance capture proof of concept segments, scene deconstructions, art galleries and much more.  If you're curious about Pandora or what it takes to pull off a film like this, you'll enjoy poring over these details.<br /><br />There is, of course, one major omission from this release: it's still not 3D (hence 4 stars, instead of 5).  And as much as I wish it were 3D, I can understand why Fox is not putting out a general release Blu-ray 3D version of the film at this time.  The market of 3D TV owners simply isn't large enough for ths studio to invest in a separate Blu-ray 3D release at this time.  Although sales would probably be impressive, the 3D version of the film would be playable by relatively few viewers.  Instead of not releasing a Blu-ray 3D version at all, Fox has partnered with Panasonic to offer a basic Blu-ray 3D version of the film (theatrical cut only) as an exclusive promotion for buyers of Panasonic 3D TVs (past and present).  This arrangement allows Panasonic to bring the 3D version of the film to consumers, while also giving Fox the \\"financial security\\" to know that they can be profitable with the 3D Disc.  This arrangement also gives consumers a major incentive to choose a Panasonic 3D TV.  But it leaves buyers of other brands' 3D TVs out in the cold, and frankly, that part sucks.  It means these consumers will need to turn to eBay or other secondary markets in order to obtain a 3D version of the film.  From our discussions with the studio and manufacturer, we believe this will be a one year exclusivity window.  Cameron and Fox have stated (at Blu-Con in Beverly Hills earlier this month), that this Collector's Edition of the film will be the \\"final word\\" on the film, as far as 2D is concerned, and a general retail version of the film on Blu-ray 3D will follow, but not for at least a year.<br /><br />So, is it ideal that we don't have a 3D version of the biggest 3D movie of all time available to general consumers?  No.  But for the vast majority of Blu-ray and HDTV owners, who are not yet 3D-enabled, this Collector's Edition of the film offers a major improvement over the earlier single-disc edition and earns our recommendation.<br /><br />Our more detailed review is available on our web site at Big Picture Big Sound (dot com).are on disc two, combining over 45 minutes of new footage with enough transitional scenes to total up to just over 68 minutes running time.

He seems to be headed for the techno/pop sound that his protege Justin Beiber has going right now (and who by the way, is getting really famous from). However, I dont think Raymond v Raymond is that bad. I actually dont mind that I brought the album, whereas if I had brought Here I Stand I would have been upset. The reason is because there are quite a few songs on this cd that I actually like.     Monstar, Hey Daddy, There Goes My Baby, OMG (guilty pleasure :), Mars vs Venus, Pro Lover, Okay, and Making Love (Into The Night) make this CD worth buying for me. I can listen to those songs repeatedly and not get tired of them. They are in my opinion the best songs on the CD. That being said, yes, there are some questionable songs here, and yes it is not as good as the Confessions CD. I think that Confessions was to Usher what Thriller was to MJ. I seriously doubt he can make another Confessions. But I can accept this CD as it is because he did have some really good songs that I like. I guess the same goes for others: everything depends on how you view the songs, some will like them and others wont. For that reason, I am giving the CD 4 stars: not the best, but its still good. I would say give it a chance. It is a good CD.
0553805371|2.0|Reading through the book just confirms my suspicion about its quality based on its title. There is nothing grand about the way Hawking evangelize M-theory as to explain the origin of the universe. Ironically, the authors repeatedly tried to knock off God, only to replace him with a set of natural laws and theological argument why they gave rise to the universe.    The authors make a classical mistake that was common to many scientists before them. That is wild extrapolation. Just because we know something about the universe does not mean we know or about to know everything about it. At the end of 19th century, emboldened by scientific advances and discoveries, many believed that we knew all natural laws there were and they could be used to explain, even predict everything that was going to happen in the world. Of course we know the outcome of that belief. The 20th century saw the birth of relativity theory, quantum mechanism, chaos theory, and others to account for the observations that cannot be explained by 19th science. There is no evidence that 21st century's science will make the final, grand discovery that can explain everything.    Most likely we as the human species with our limited intellectual capacity cannot comprehend, let alone explain everything in the universe. If we don't expect monkeys to design computer or solve differential equations, why do we think we can explain everything? Millions of years ago, we evolved from monkeys and we continue to evolve. There is no reason to believe that we have reached the apex of our evolution, that our brain has developed enough to understand everything. To believe so is simply arrogant, narrow-minded, and foolish.
030726999X|5.0|What a thrilling end to the Millenium trilogy.  Stieg Larsson again has crafted a novel that captivates readers and leaves them reading late into the night to discover what plot twists lay ahead.  The final book written by Larsson, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is a must-read for fans of the series.  The film simply does not the book justice.
0060775858|1.0|What a dumb book!!!!  Thankfully I didn't waste money on it.  I know it's one of the most popular baby books out there, but I don't get it.  There are a million better books... this one is terrible.
B003YWUTJI|3.0|I got a free review copy from One2One Networks and I was excited because I had never heard a Norah Jones album before. This one is a bunch of duets, cameos and other projects that she has done in collaboration with other singers and bands. So, it's more of a compilation. It was too slow and mellow for my tastes. But if you like something relaxing, this could be perfect for you.
0061537969|5.0|This book was a present and I was a bit taken aback.  I kind of stay away from \\"animal stories\\".   But it was given to me by a very wonderful woman who loved it and I decided to give it a try.  Be prepared.....my own tears started right at the beginning.  But it's such a beautifully told story, one that swept me right into it and carried me to the end.  It is a book I will read again, because I so fell in love with Enzo.  The description on the race track had me smiling, laughing and crying all at once. Never see a stuffed zebra without thinking of that sweet dog.
B003YWUTJI|1.0|Horrible does not describe how painful it was to listen to this album...  How can one so talented be a partied to such horror....  Like Marlon Brando's last words in \\"Apocalypse Now\\", \\"The horror, the horror\\".... and he was talking about war...  well there you have this album<br /><br />Horrible sung wonderfully is still horrible... and wonderful talent underutilized is worse than horrible, it's despicable...<br /><br />The last album stunk... this is worse, some songs I had to skip they were so bad... solidifying my thought, that Norah's handler's just don't know what to do with her....<br /><br />When will she come back to music? the music that depends on the vocal inflections she can deliver with her marvelous voice....  great talent, genius sometimes just fades away... and maybe this is happening to Norah?  what a shame...  how shameless, in it just for the money...<br /><br />This album is rubbish...<br /><br />I can remember before she had even released her first album how the internet was a-buzz with bootlegs of Norah singing at parties, in living rooms or just any old place....  these were great recordings...  I've learned over the years what treasures they really are....<br /><br />Please Norah find a good collaborator... someone who is worthy of you.... like Christian McBride, Esperanza Spalding, Ceu, Bruna Caram, Chiara Civello, Haydee, Marisa Monte [and the list goes on and on] or someone of their stature... quit hiding in the realm of pop...  I have a million ideas for her.... but alas...  who cares.... certainly not who she is currently managed by.........<br /><br />The album cover telegraphs it all... Norah pictured thinking [and you can just read her mind], \\"Oh, my God\\"! boy, she just didn't want to be there...<br /><br />Listen at your own risk, nausea guaranteed!!
B0041QSZJM|5.0|Those who know and love Pink Martini easily could predict that their Christmas album would be unique, multi-cultural, and tremendous fun.  The first track is a traditional, mellow version of \\"White Christmas\\" with a poignant solo guitar accompanying China Forbes' lovely vocals. China treats us to the often-amputated intro \\"The sun is shining; the grass is green, the orange and palm trees sway; there's never been such a day in Beverly Hills L. A.; but it's December the 24th and I'm longing to be up north.\\"<br /><br />In a major plot twist, the song is then sung in Japanese, by guest vocalist Saori Yuki, with a celestial choir. The haunting, nostalgic arrangement reminds me of the wonderful Jackie Gleason Christmas album my parents used to play when we were kids a long time ago.<br /><br />Track three, \\"Shchedryk  (Ukranian Bell Carol)\\" a.k.a. \\"Carol of the Bells\\" by Ukrainian composer Mykola Dmytrovych Leontovych, is performed in its original language, with a bit of percussion (and of course some bells) backing the Pacific Youth Choir. After a tongue-in-cheek take of \\"Santa Baby\\" we are treated to Danny Masang's  beautiful \\"Elohai, N'tzor\\" on which guest vocalists Ida Rae Cahana and Ari Shapiro join China Forbes for a touching, harmonic, Hebrew interlude. Next, \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" showcases the percussion, brass, bass, and piano talents of the group.<br /><br />We then jump to China (the country) for \\"Congratulations - A Happy New Year Song\\" sung in Chinese by Timothy Nishimoto and China Forbes, followed by the Cuban Missile Crisis era \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" Next, in Italian, a leap back 100 years for \\"La Vergine Degli Angeli\\" from Verdi's \\"La Forza Del Destino\\" : majestic and moving. \\"We Three Kings\\" gets a somewhat funky/jazzy coat of paint, which works surprisingly well. In a nod to Country music (or perhaps, Hawaiian?),  \\"A Snowglobe Christmas\\" an original song written by China Forbes and the group's co-founder and pianist, Thomas Lauderdale, features a slide guitar. Next, a nod to Chanukah, with a Latin twist: \\"Ocho Kandelikas (Eight Little Candles). Imagine Xavier Cugat's band performing a Chanukah song. Sounds weird, but musically sounds great!<br /><br />\\"Silent Night,\\" a Christmas tradition since the early 1800's, is presented in a sparse arrangement, sung  first in the original German, then in Arabic by by Lebanese superstar Fairouz, and finally by the Portland Boychoir. The effect is touching and powerful.  To conclude, a rendition of Auld Lang Syne with a Rio Carnival/marching band beat, sung in English, French, and Arabic.<br /><br />I've had the pleasure of seeing Pink Martini perform live a number of times, most recently last night. The musical talent in the group is stellar; their joy in music is evident. I recommend this CD without reservation; it will bring you the world, and joy to your world.o Chanukah, with a Latin twist: \\"Ocho Kandelikas (Eight Little Candles).

B0042JTDXK|5.0|For people who were expecting this album to be like the previous ones, you will be disappointed.  I love this album. JG took the risk to adventure into an area he has never touched before and that was producing his own material. Its beautiful. The real, unplugged Josh. You can have both the joy of listening to a David Foster glossy JG or a Rick Rubin, realty JG. When you come down to the nuts and bolts, its basically the music, the lyrics and the passionate voice of JG that sold this album for me, not David Foster or Rick Rubin, but solely the talent of Josh Groban.
B0026ZNL7Q|5.0|THE BAND: Mariusz Duda (vocals, bass, acoustic guitar), Piotr Grudzinski (guitars), Michal Lapaj (keyboards), Piotr Kozieradski (drums & percussion). Home: Warsaw, Poland.<br /><br />THE DISC: (2009) Five songs clocking in at 44:44 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page foldout containing song lyrics, a band photo and thank you's. This is the band's 4th studio album. There is a hard case `Special Edition' release - containing a live 7 song DVD recorded from 2008 at the Paradiso Theater in Amsterdam (41 minutes long, all songs are from the previous 3 albums... sadly, no songs on the DVD from Anno Domini). Label - Mystic Productions (Poland) / InsideOut Music.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I've wanted to write this review for many months, but I felt I just didn't know where to begin. I'd never experienced writer's block with music. This album was such an amazing listen for me, that I had to get my point across succinctly, but... how to portray that feeling into a few short paragraphs? Where to start... I was lost. Being a fan of Porcupine Tree, Amazon suggested I check this band out. Years ago, I started with \\"Rapid Eye Movement\\" (2007). I liked the album enough that I went and purchased the two earlier discs - \\"Out Of Myself\\" (2003) and \\"Second Life Syndrome\\" (2005). All of these were good, with \\"REM\\" starting to put the brilliant pieces together with style.<br /><br />This \\"Anno Domini\\" hit me differently. Was it the new studio, a slight break in direction, or a new producer? I say a combination of all three. After a few listens, I thought it was very good. After perhaps a hundred spins at home, in the car and at work, I thought it was brilliant - this is hands down my favorite disc from 2009. Though perhaps short in length (5 tracks clocking in at 44:44), I truly believe the band hits on all 5 cylinders on each and every track.<br /><br />\\"Hyperactive\\" (the opening track) starts off with a beautiful piano intro. The piano fades and the guitars and drums roll slowly inward while the keyboards hold the song together. Enter Mariusz Duda's vocal words and the song truly takes off. I thing Grudzinski's guitar is the star here. Crunchy, flowing and simply absent in all the right places. Track 2 - \\"Driven To Destruction\\" starts off with a bass riff with the band following shortly thereafter. The heavy beginning is short lived as a truckload of atmosphere is soon delivered. Like most of the songs here, you're pulled in several different directions within the track. The backbone of the song is Lapaj's keyboards/piano/synth along with Grudzinski's sweeping Gilmouresque guitar solos. Perhaps the most ambitious song is track 3, \\"Egoist Hedonist\\". It's divided into 3 parts (Different?/Hedonist Party/Straw Man Dance). The song goes from slow to fast and back again... with brilliant guitar vs keyboard jams in between. If I had to pick a winner, Lapaj's keyboards dominate (reminiscent of Jon Lord in his prime). By now, you're half way through the album and \\"Left Out\\" begins. If there ever was a song that sounded like it was penned by Waters & Gilmour, track 4 is it. A slow intro with a haunting guitar, ripping into the rest of the song. You close your eyes as the guitar solo takes hold of you. Lapaj's keyboards and various synth noises are a constant \\"on\\" in the background. Duda's vocals range from energized to angry, to uplifting and emotional, to complete despair and sorrow. Up and down, this song takes you on a journey... simply a beautiful track... my favorite of the bunch. The last track is also the longest one (\\"Hybrid Times\\" clocks in at just under 12 minutes). Piotr Grudzinski's guitar work simply shines. Might I also note that Kozieradski drumming and Duda's bass guitar are stellar throughout the album<br /><br />There was a lot of good music in the rock and progressive field released in 2009 (Dream Theater - Black Clouds & Silver Linings, Porcupine Tree - The Incident, Muse - The Resistance, Katatonia - Night Is The New Day, Transatlantic - The Whirlwind, Megadeth - Endgame) and I put Riverside at the top of the pile. Grudzinski's guitar is in rare form as is Lapaj's keyboards. The only way \\"Anno Domini High Definition\\" could have been better is if it were longer (5+ stars).me) and I put Riverside at the top of the pile.

B0001I561E|5.0|I still vividly remember the amazement and awe of sitting in the movie theater in 1992 watching this movie for the first time. My mouth never closed from laughing and amazement.  It was extremely funny, clever, warm, beautiful, intelligent...everything I thought movies were not anymore. The songs were so enjoyable and memorable and Robin was a riot with every word he said. I watch it now on DVD and am still amazed at its brilliance. The sequels were cute but can't compare with the first. It should have won the Oscar for best picture and Robin Williams deserved a best actor Oscar for sure. It is defintely the funniest Disney movie every made.    Just watch it over and over and enjoy!

B002ZG99TA|4.0|I like all sorts of movies for all sorts of reasons. From the trash to the treasures, I'll give it a shot to show me what it's got. And I don't care as much if someone likes or doesn't like a particular film as much as I care why they like or don't like it. You can't put a film like \\"Independence Day\\" in the same category as \\"The Seven Samurai\\" but that doesn't keep me from viewing either repeatedly. Each film needs to know what it's looking to do and each needs to succeed in its own right.    Tony Scott is a seasoned director. He usually exercises great authority over his projects and \\"Unstoppable\\" is no exception. This is just a way cool flick that will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of it. A runaway train, loaded with toxic goo and explosive goo, is barreling down the tracks and it's going to make an awful mess of things unless our heroes save the day.     I never thought much one way or the other about what goes on in a train yard. This gave me a real eye opener on that count. I got to know about trains, routing, switching, union politics and a lot more. The viewer gets a good sense about how involved it all is. It's set in Southern Pennsylvania in late autumn. Again, Scott does a good job of giving the viewer a sense of people and place. You feel like you're there.     The characters are good. The action is relieved by scenes of the two leads getting buddy buddy with each other, so you have a reason to care about them. Rosario Dawson is always a treat for the eyes and she has a good roll here. A note on this. The main three actors all need to do their thing in very confined spaces. Washington and Pine are in the locomotive for most of the movie and Dawson is in her office. These actors have to deliver most of their lines sitting down. If that's not a testament to their abilities I don't know what is.     The action is good and it's smart. The writers did their due diligence on the tech stuff so the viewer gets the whys and wherefores on the gravityof the situation. There is a logical progression to the things that happen. And as they unfold I found myself getting more and more involved. It draws you in and doesn't let go.    Is this the best movie ever made? No. But it delivers the goods in spades. If you're at all disposed toward this sort of thing, spend your money at the box office. It's a bit loud (maybe more than a bit) but seeing it on the big screen is the way to go.
B0041CGP02|5.0|Very good CD.    A lot of Hits.    Despite the fact that some important songs are missed in an 2 CDs release (I actually found one of them: Never Say Goodbye\\")
B00428ZRFE|3.0|Rihanna is not a singer, at least not in the Patti LaBelle sense. She is a performance artist who can, at best, sing moderately well. Realization of this fact makes her music at once easier to digest.<br /><br />There is no arguing with results - she has, as with \\"Rated R\\" and, especially, \\"Good Girl Gone Bad,\\" a nice helping of radio-ready hits with sing-a-long-able hooks and catchy choruses.<br /><br />Like Janet Jackson before her, Rihanna is not about voice, emotional depth or texture. Her vocal ability is tight and quite limited - when she tries for high, rangy notes it really shows - and it is clearly pitch-corrected in the recording studio, but in a sense that does not matter because these songs do not depend on vocal gymnastics so much as they do suave personality and star power.<br /><br />Sure, none of these sound like signature, memorable songs that belong in a time capsule. However, they will sound great emanating from boom boxes and DJ booths until the spring or early summer of 2011, and that's what those seeking a new Rihanna album are in the market for.<br /><br />\\"Only Girl (In the World)\\" is a catchy piece of pop ideal for Top 40 and dance radio, while \\"What's My Name\\" featuring Drake has a breezy, Caribbean feel that might make it a more ideal summer single. These are the kinds of songs Rihanna's primarily young female audience can easily sing along - and relate - to. \\"Cheers (Drink to That)\\" sounds precision-tooled to blare out of car speakers on a Friday night.<br /><br />\\"California King Bed\\" is a soul-searching ballad with an instantly unforgettable chorus. It is destined to be another hit. Nicki Minaj also sounds awesome on \\"Raining Men.\\"<br /><br />There is filler here, like the paranoid \\"Man Down,\\" which could be seen as a continuation of \\"Breaking Dishes\\" from the \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" album. Its story of murdering an abusive boyfriend and repentance afterward tries for edginess, but it is cliched and skippable. Rihanna does not sound believable.<br /><br />\\"S&M,\\" like Janet Jackson at most her lewd, might allow for some hypersexual imagery during a stage show, but on disc it is trite and without a catchy enough chorus to bother playing. \\"Complicated\\" tests the limits of Rihanna's small voice unsuccessfully - earplugs are necessary 20 seconds after it begins - and \\"Skin\\" is limp, uninviting and not worth repeat plays.<br /><br />\\"Loud\\" is a mixed bag of an album where the hits stand out obviously from the filler. Nothing on it is a destined classic, but it has enough catchy hooks to keep up Rihanna's winning streak for the time being.ght allow for some hypersexual imagery during a stage show, but on disc it is trite and without a catchy enough chorus to bother playing. \\"Complicated\\" tests the limits of Rihanna's small voice unsuccessfully - earplugs are necessary 20 seconds after it begins - and \\"Skin\\" is limp, uninviting and not worth repeat plays.   \\"Loud\\" is a mixed bag of an album where the hits stand out obviously from the filler.

I hadn't worked out in about 2 years and when I started on Day 1 I was exhausted after 22 minutes!!  I tried to go to Level 2 after 5 days and went back down to level 1 (level 2 is pretty intense).  My advice would be to measure yourself before you start the video because the scale may not always show you what is really happening.  I feel so much better doing this and I am only on day 8!!  :)
B003YWUTJI|5.0|A generous, well-oiled - though incomplete - sampling of Norah Jones' non-album collaborations with her colleagues, \\"Featuring Norah Jones\\" is an excellent compilation of wonderful work from the past decade. For fans of Jones who did not realize the great frequency with which she works as a guest and session musician - or lacked the wherewithal to hunt each individual track down - this disc is ideal.<br /><br />There is quite a diverse array of artists on the disc - from Talib Kwali to Dolly Parton to Outkast - which might lead some to worry that \\"Featuring Norah Jones\\" sounds like a bunch of songs thrown together disjointedly. Fortunately, the tracks are sequenced in a way that not only feels natural, ideal for straight-through play, but that highlights Jones' versatility. She is an intriguing, deceivingly simple talent, and a fascinating common denominator.<br /><br />A few tracks actually predate her \\"Come Away With Me\\" success, including the best track here - and still one of the best Jones has ever recorded - \\"More Than This,\\" a collaboration with the exquisitely talented jazz musician Charlie Hunter from his 2001 release \\"Songs from the Analog Playground.\\" The Roxy Music cover is blissful, elegant and everlasting in its arrangement, continuing to sound fresh, and Jones' emphatic, less-is-more vocal approach is instantly memorable. It is a track to savor.<br /><br />The Grammy-winning \\"Here We Go Again\\" with the late Ray Charles is a slinky, R&B-flavored treat, even though it could have garnered a Grammy no matter how they arranged it. Tracks with Herbie Hancock and the Foo Fighters are also easy on the ears.<br /><br />Jones' country leanings show her wide artistic pallete, but they are rather reigned in as opposed to dour, so they can be enjoyed by those listeners who prefer her cocktail jazz stylings. She harmonizes heavenly with Gillian Welch and David Rawlings on \\"Loretta\\" and waxes poetic with Ryan Adams on \\"Dear John,\\" a 2005 collaboration from Adams' startlingly executed \\"Jacksonville City Nights\\" album. The results sound seamless, clearly the result of great labor and attention to detail. \\"Creepin' In,\\" a folksy, lighthearted duet with Dolly Parton is the only track to repeat from a Norah Jones release.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Willie Nelson oozes charm with Jones on \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside,\\" a Q-Tip and Outkast collaborate to produce cool, trippy sounds on \\"Life is Better\\" and \\"Take Off Your Cool,\\" respectively.<br /><br />A sprawling, nicely woven collection, \\"Featuring Norah Jones\\" is everything it promises to be and more. Nicely complimenting her solo work, it entertains while affirming Jones' post-\\"Don't Know Why\\" worth.e City Nights\\" album.

B0042JTDXK|4.0|Josh Groban has clearly taken time to choose just the material he wants to showcase his abilities and delight his listeners with \\"Illuminations.\\" He sings with warmth, grace and dexterity, not to mention technical precision and prowess that cannot be credibly argued against.<br /><br />Some prefer a singer who show signs of exertion when they perform. Josh Groban is not that kind of singer. His technical gift is so obvious and great that he never seems to break a sweat. He runs the risk of seeming less than sincere or earnest as a result, since he so obviously never has to reach high to achieve terrific results, which he does here.<br /><br />Fortunately, the songs are often very strong - and his enthusiasm for them so great - that getting lost in his rich, lyrical baritone is inevitable from a single spin.<br /><br />He soars especially on the non-English material. \\"L'Oro D'ell Addio\\" is wall to wall high-flying rapture, with Groban's voice going deeply low and marvelously high with undiluted grace and beauty. \\"Au Jardin Des-Sans Pourquoi\\" is similar, with seamless, breathtaking orchestration and Groban's impassioned vocals pouring over it like melted butter.<br /><br />He will not be recording duets with Rihanna or Katy Perry anytime soon.<br /><br />A couple English tunes stand out because they are, succinctly, not good enough.  They sound pleasant - everything Groban has wrapped his voice around is worth hearing - but it is hard not to feel that they are a waste of his sprawling talent. He sounds remarkably invested in \\"Higher Window,\\" which is gorgeously orchestrated and arranged, but its lyrics border on banal and its melody is not imaginative or engaging. The same goes for \\"Hidden Away,\\" which sounds formulaic and predictable, even if his voice is -indeed - stunning and huggably warm.<br /><br />He does display imagination as a song writer on \\"War at Home,\\" which focuses on domestic troubles without sounding trite or earthbound. It is not jarring, even as it as immediately follows the uncontainable, deadly serious \\"Voce Existe en Mim,\\" a Portugese tune.<br /><br />\\"Straight to You\\" is epic and grandiose without sounding stuffy or insincere - a heartrending finale that finishes the disc ideally.<br /><br />Fans of Groban will relish this album and wear it out like an old cliche. True, not every tune is worthy of his pipes, but then that sets the standards unfairly high.

Excellent value in comparison to the horribly overpriced smaller bags sold by other manufacturers. Definitely recommended!
