B004ASBRW8|5|i love love love these nice soft shorts. i intend on ordering the pants as well. i dont know if they helping with the cellulite... i just like how they feel when im exericing and they make me look slim.....lol
B004L60FU4|4|Head circumference is 22 1/2 &#34; (inches). Nice color and easy fit. Material is polyester and unlined. A bit itchy after prolonged wear. But given the price, it is really a great deal.
B00GRXVEH2|4|I like the drawstring on my kids' pants since they are slim but tall.  This is warm and fits pretty well.
B00BV2UN3K|3|I recently purchased this item, I typically wear a medium on all clothes.  I thought that since I would be wearing layers to order a large.  It was still to small when I was wearing just a t-shirt.  I am 6' and weigh 170 lbs.  It is a nice design and a nice look, you just need to order big when deciding on this coat.
B000S2WGUC|5|She loved it and so did I !<br /><br />I felt weird starting this review, but then I realized that you want purchase this naughty netting to. DO IT!
B005FCZ332|5|Since I decided to relocate from Turtle Rock I've been itching to dispose of my mirror shield. The pain of constantly blinding yourself in battle is absurd. They told me the operator was dysfunctional, whatever that means. Regardless, you could imagine my ecstatic state upon discovering my old shield!  It's worth every rupee and I can't wait to be reunited. Not to mention the handy chain someone attached, so I'll surely never lose it again.. Here I was thinking Amazon was run by a bunch of dinolfos' but if this works out I'll definitely  be a returning customer.
B00ESYAWTI|1|False advertising, this hat is supper thin and poorly made.  It does not look or fit as shown in the advertisement.  You can see clearly through the knitting (it's so loose) and does not fit well or stay on your head.  The seller even re-used a mail bag that list cell phone as the contents.
B002IFDXMM|3|maybe i was too fat or partying too hard in it, but it fell apart half way through the first time ever wearing it.... buuuuuut it served it's purpose i guess and it was pretty cheap so i give it a couple starz it probably didnt deserve
B00FR7QVS6|5|I was so excited when I received the shirt. Adding to my &#34;favorite shirts list&#34;
B00AFQENIY|5|very good pant
B00M4Z9KFU|5|perfect
B009Z3Y21Q|5|Though I think this sweatshirt was a bit overpriced, it fit well and was fairly well made.  My child wanted it for a Halloween costume and he loved it.
B000UA2LHA|5|Good quality and good price.
B00BD7EC08|2|Will not stay fastened. Will not keep wig in place.<br />I would not recommend this product. Doesn't stay on shaved or bald head
B00S4ZO6RG|4|Great summer workout pants
B00M0HEP0M|5|HOW DOES A TIE BAR FIT??!  That's a hilarious question. Well, it's a little wide in the hips. And little long in the torso, but somehow it makes my ties look skinny! Actually, very awesome design and adds a bit of intrigue to possibly otherwise boring outfits. Great find!!
B00KWY5TBO|5|I love this dress. I'm curvy and it fits perfect. I did get a large and I'm a size 11 in women jeans
B00OGSK778|5|First pair of leg warmers and I absolutely love them! Great quality and so cute with any boot!
B001H1PYD4|2|Disintegrates after washing.  I put this in the hand wash cycle of my washer along with my other bras.  The elastic on this disintegrated and pulled off of the bra after one wash. As a new mom I don't have time to wash things by hand in the sink.
B0037J37RO|5|I've tried multiple shirt stays and I just couldn't get it right. These keep my shirt tucked in all day and these rarely ever come off from my shirt!
B00F96N3EK|5|yay
B00G9AYJRK|5|Great quality. Very Comfortable.
B00JE57IVG|4|This dress definitely fit better than I expected. I'm 5'6&#34;, 120 lbs, and a 34B and ordered a medium. Honestly, the fit for my body type is great. The other review said that the material was thick and the bottom with the lace made it difficult to walk in. Neither one of those was true with my dress. The material is thinner, but very stretchy so it's super comfy. The bottom where the lace is has a slit in the back on my dress so it wasn't tight at all. The ONLY downside was that it wasn't quite as long as I thought it would be. It comes to mid knee and I was expecting a little bit longer. That's just nitpicking though. For the price, this is a beautiful dress! Also, I purchased the dress on 11/28, it shipped on 11/29, and I received it on 12/11. Fast shipping!
B0063OPXQS|5|gifted this to my niece, who loves it. Fits true to size and is made of flexible material, very important when you are an active 4 year old! I recommend this brand raincoat to all.
B008J0VAQ6|5|This is the best kind jacket I ever had , it's easy , thin & comfortable .feels good after I wear
B000B5ZK2M|5|I have been wanting a nice leather jacket for awhile. Found this one on amazon and LOVE it. Very warm and goes with anything. Fit is great and am thoroughly enjoying my new jacket. Not suitable for extremely cold temperatures but works great for Alabama:) Good deal, fast delivery. Overall.... two thumbs up.
B00EKH4W4Y|5|I love these BCBG leggings!  They fit perfectly and I got them for almost half of what they are selling for at BCBG!
B00JLFY7MW|4|Good shirt, especially for the price... Disregard the 1-star review.
B004X2556U|1|I wear a medium but ordered the large just in case it ran small. It was poorly made and not the quality I would have expected and the sizing is all wrong.
B00HOFIRZO|5|Feels wonderful, very soft great colors, and fits well.
B006SRTDQ6|3|Nice and comfy when you're a-sleepin'. But don't wear these if you're a-workin'. They get sweaty and cold.
B007U45EYG|5|Like the other reviewer, my daughter is very petite (she just turned two) and is on the small end of \\"2T\\" sizes.  After reading reviews of this and other similar Zutano shirts, I ordered a 3T for my daughter.  And, even the 3T fits very snugly!  It looks cute of course, but I definitely recommend ordering up a size or two.<br /><br />My daughter LOVES this shirt and requsts is often!  \\"Owl shirt?  Puh-leeeez?\\"
B00B5PV0BM|5|Perfect for trwo year old Birthday
B001JBNDLW|5|perfect... i would and probably will buy again..
B000KKP3UW|5|I keep buying these and they last forever and I never get blisters even on a long hike.
B00BVWZCLS|5|Perfect for the gym so I'm not worried about my towel falling off.  Light and comfortable.
B00T6NLNC6|5|They were bought for a relative, she liked the colors, the fit and she stated that they feel very comfortable.<br />For me , the Purchaser, the price was very right, the fabric very nice,  made a very nice gift. She thinks<br />I paid alot of money for them.
B007B9LRYG|3|so i got this wig for sailor moon obviously<br />it was awesome i wore it to ASTL and everyone wanted my picture :D the colour is awesome if ur going for the bright yellow anime look :)<br />unfortunately, it was very windy and the wig tangles SO MUCH and they're very very hard to get out<br />i have to be sailor moon again and i have to use this wig but after this con im gonna have to get a different wig :(
B00L07MUBY|5|Excelent product!!!
B003JH8T9A|5|For the price this is a great set of horns that look cool.
B006U1GXPE|3|Looked large compared to the other pair I ordered but they fit my 1 year granddaughter fine and were very cute
B00DGYERTC|3|good fabric and well-made for the price, but somehow doesn't look as stylish as in the picture. I gave mine away to a friend.
B00CFQIV9Y|2|Beautiful and fine workmanship. On a miniature garment. Sad.<br />Other sakkas clothes that are ordered in actual sizes are correctly sized. Not a mini \\"one size\\".
B00KUU4NDU|5|Adorable pajamas. Smaller than typical size-- I bought 7 and it fits more like 5t.
B00F0WW7R2|5|Nice product for the price, I appreciate that it's reusable & the shipping was good. I think I will order a size c instead of my normal b, just because they seemed a bit slim if that makes sense.
B00OK47PMS|2|The material is what you might expect it to be for such a low price. It fits like I thought it would, but the stitching is off in the most obvious place (right down the front). I plan to return it.
B008HTJJ1C|4|If you are looking for a durable workout pant look elsewhere. If you are looking for a light weight comfortable and inexpensive pant best for lounging, this is for you.  With a relaxed fit and a loose ankle bottom they are easy on-easy off. Most pants are made of a heavy sweat-fleece like material and are heavier than I want.  These are perfect for summer and room temperature situations.<br />They are prone to ripping around the pockets, but they do not pill.
B0053XF8W4|2|I wanted to like this, I really did. But I can't. The top folds down quite a bit. I am a size 7, so I bought a medium originally. Because it kept folding down on me, I got a large. That one was entirely too big all around. I didn't care about comfort. It works a lot like a sausage casing. Definitely pulled everything in. Just didn't stay up where it needed to.
B00928XTRC|1|What are you thinking???? This is a horrible item you are offering for sale. I can not express my disgust. This needs to come down NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0007YR94O|5|If you are looking for something comfortable and support look no further. This gives you plenty of support and does not hurt your shoulders. Also it has a enough lift to keep you cool. We all know bigger chested gets hot, this lift eliminates that.
B00BVZZRZ6|4|When I received the costume I was impressed with the quality/price ratio although the quiver, holster, and gloves needed a little work. The only real issue I had was the size. Even though I sent in my measurements it was still at least two sizes too big. But also that can be fixed with a little more time and money.
B002GHCEAO|5|Well made and sized as marked. Would purchase again. My son is very tall and thin 6'2&#34; 155 lbs and the tall large fits well without being too baggy about the waist.
B00O8CLT8I|1|Quality is poor.
B008LY4FRQ|4|generally ok except material feels stiff
B005K1YDBG|5|Use this to fit a bit slimmer into my work uniforms, just temporary till I can get that holiday weight off. Overall great product if you want to look slimer.
B00D8BJGGC|1|Cheap material. Poorly made. And the fit is strange. I'm just going to throw it away. Don't waste your time or money on this purchase
B009TB0ILW|5|The quality of this cap is very nice...I purchased one for my grandaughter as well as myself.. Recommend for all ages , very nice...
B002SE8ICI|5|awesome wirefree bra!
B002MZIGVQ|5|Worked great for the prop needed.
B00CC944QS|2|Materiel is very itchy
B008M1U5DQ|3|I liked this jacket a lot. THE ONE IN THE PICTURE ! I did not recieve the same one. I liked this jacket because of the colors. The one I recieved is blue and rust-ish... I do not like red plaid so I'm a little disappointed. Oh well...
B00FBQQF5W|5|Perfect for little legs in the winter.  My 2- and 4- year olds loved wearing these over pants or tights in the winter to add extra warmth and color to their outfits.  2-year old could put up to top of thigh; 4-year old just over knee.
B00MF6WNHA|4|Great design, good adjustability with back expander and halter buckles.  I'm somewhat disappointed with the fabric and laces. I would have paid more to have a heavier weight pleather  and more substantial string ties. I will be changing out the laces for real leather.
B00NXKGY18|5|I love this Sweater, was more than I expected.  The feel is wonderful!!!  Would buy it again.
B00OMCPKCK|3|Quality isn't the best. Expect to wear additional support.
B0055WR5T2|1|it looks nice but is nice cotton but the print is horrible and is like a nightmare when watch cloose
B00H3W1P2K|5|I am extremely pleased with this vest. I was surprised at how well made it is. It fit my husband perfectly. He looked awesome in it for our son's wedding. I ordered his regular size and was a bit nervous because half the reviews said it ran small, some said it ran large. My husband is trim and has broad shoulders, he usually wears a large and that is what I ordered and it is perfect. I couldn't have rented a vest near as nice for the price we bought this one for. I'm happy.
B00IT68CDY|5|These separates worked out perfectly! I measured my husband to be sure of the fit and it was all true to size. So pleased!
B0112OCX7K|5|Really good it's how I expected it
B00L2L7LW6|3|When I wear this awesome shirt people around town are like.. Hey, cool shirt. Wow great shirt. That's awesome. Look mom it's chewy riding a bike!..I even got a high five, a hug and a kiss. A winning lottery ticket, a cherry slurpy. And a cop paid for my parking meter. I met a girl, fell in love, got married. Found my missing sock and my dog came home. Life is good. Thanks shirt. Your the best!!..
B010DMCXLI|4|Would be perfect if I were 5ft instead of 5ft8! It's not &#34;floor length&#34; on me at all, so taller gals take heed. Shorter women— enjoy! It's made very well. I'm going to see if I can add another hoop or two to salvage it.
B0030DFDCY|4|a little short but fine.
B00CI3GNC6|5|My youngest son loves Mickey Mouse, so I purchased this outfit as a Christmas gift.  It fits exactly as described, and it did not shrink when I washed it!  He loves to wear it, and so far it has held up well.  Seems to be made of good quality!  I am very happy with the purchase and shipping!
B000ODGXKE|5|Love this bra
B0096D4GBG|5|I'm just going to say these things look badass. They are comfortable and the leather is very supple. Tho the thumbs stick out a little past my thumb and cause me to honk the horn when i go to turn my blinker off, not a deal breaker just an odd quirk, and hey, maybe I just have short thumbs.
B002UVF36I|5|I love this clutch. The outer material is so soft and looks like leather. It also has numerous compartments for cards and such and a  compartment for money/coins. This product was definitely worth every penny. I love it!
B0046BPFCC|5|This robe is awesome!
B000FP79KE|1|I'm normally a large gal cause I like loose fitting outfits but this chemise is way too short and fits me like a tank top
B002USCHM4|5|Adorable!  Fit my newborn bit large at first, but well worth the money.  She was in it for more than a month and past her eight pound weight.
B000QWB178|5|Seamless is wonderful. These fit very well. Easy to sit long hours in. Made well with great comfort. After just having some female surgeries these were exactly what I needed to help sit pain free at my desk.
B0008EOFWC|5|I am somewhat disappointed in the way these new jeans fit and the feel of the fabric as it does not feel as heavy as the previous jeans I have bought thru JCP. These new jeans fit more like a relaxed fit as opposed to the regular fit that I have always worn. I'm not considering returning these new jeans but will be very surprised if these last as long as my older jeans have.
B00GN9XMC0|2|This dress takes forever to ship and receive. Once I finally received it the dress was small and very thin. Might work as a beach cover but to thin to wear out in public and not worth returning.
B00BLXNFYI|5|Love fits perfect!!!!
B00AX7BUZO|4|My daughter was in love with this dress. The only thing I did not like is the fact that the flower is not sewn on and it kept moving all around the front of the dress, a bit of a distraction and disappointing. Other than that I loved the dress.
B0078IRSIE|5|These are true to fit, have a good amount of stretch, wash well and wear well.  What more can I say.
B00FRT5KRM|5|This shirt was the perfect gift for my husband. The decal has not faded and it has been washed several times. It also did not shrink in the dryer.
B00GGX3FF2|5|Exactly as expected. They look great and work great!
B00KOKA4XY|5|I love the pants and how comfortable they are. I just wish I had got a size smaller but suspect they make shrink after washing them a few times.
B003BSQOM6|5|They do what they are supposed to do!
B005XK4PHQ|5|It's warm, it's cute, it works.  The hat actually doesn't mash my hair too much, because it doesn't squeeze too close to my head.<br />I live in southern CA and this is perfect for those cooler nights, not sure, but it might be a little light for really cold climates.
B006VRM4MI|2|Even though the other review had received the wrong item I took a risk and ordered this since the sale was great.<br />My order, and the picture I ordered under clearly says \\"Kicky Pants Baby-boys Infant Print Pant, Meadow Stripe, 12-18 Months\\"<br /><br />That's STRIPE, not plaid. I like the stripe pants, cute and would work with my daughter's wardrobe. The plaid pants are just ugly. - see this link for stripe pattern http://www.amazon.com/Kicky-Pants-Baby-boys-Infant-Sleeve/dp/B006VRM8E2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360176147&sr=8-1&keywords=kicky+pants+meadow+stripe<br /><br />I'll keep them anyways since returning is a hassle and the light-weight pants are good for the hot CA central valley summers.<br />The classic/regular kicky pants are softer and come in better colors- in the future I will only get them despite the high price tag.
B009MB2V1E|5|This dress was the hit of the party!!  Everyone loved it and I felt great and very pretty in it.  I would love to have more dresses just like it.
B00AWWXFW6|5|excellent!
B00XHI2D3E|2|The material is atrocious. It's like wearing a stretchy thick weird polyester.
B00Q7514NE|5|Awesome product!  The color is perfect and the leather is soooo soft!  Goes great with NOVA checks :)
B00243FT5M|5|I love ordering from Amazon because they are so fast and the products I buy are always in great shape. I bought the big chill boys buffalo plaid vest coat navy/cobalt size 7 coat for my grandson. It fits him perfectly and looks great on him. It is also nice that you can wear it different ways such as with the vest or without the vest. Just wear the vest or the coat. The hood can be taken off also. It is just the best as far as I can see.
B000WWI814|4|it's a very good jacket and good looking even it's chinees made but it's a nice jacket that's what I was looking for...    thank you luxury lane!    Harez  Iraq
B000VDFHL8|5|After checking around, this was definitely the best price and the shirt is even nicer than I had expected.
B00K035MZ0|5|Love it thanks
B008YUTOY6|5|cumplió todas mis expectativas excelentes condiciones y fue de acurdo a lo que se pidió, es un articulo de muy buena calidad
B00CXQEXKM|5|just what I wanted. Happy with it color, size everything for what I paid.
B00ASMQ97S|4|Kinda thin but i guess great  for summer
B005KOIVRK|5|:)
B00UIKSVYY|5|Great quality shirt. Not generic looking at all. Was amazed since I got it for such a low price.
B0029LLXA4|2|This poncho was labeled and advertised as Mil-Spec, however it is definitely not.  Having spent many years in the Army I can tell the difference.  This poncho is not nearly as sturdy as a government issue poncho.  The hood cinch cord doesn't have a locking device, there is no internal tie cord, and the edges and snaps and grommets are not reinforced.  All that being said, this poncho isn't totally useless.  Unfortunately however, it's priced like a genuine Mil-Spec poncho.  In my opinion it's worth maybe half that.  Spend your money on a real GI poncho.
B00G4CQNCC|5|This robe is comfy and only comes in S/M or L/XLG.  I usually wear XL and it is large on me, but I like it bigger anyway. I spilled coffee on it right away and had to wash it the first day.  It washed well, no shrinkage and is very warm/soft.
B0078Z0TAQ|5|Loved the petticoat and the fit and quality was perfect for what I needed.  Not too full, just right.  Thanks for your goo sevice to the public and for prompt delivery and neat packaging.
B00GFMS5SG|4|great pt socks for my boyfriend
B00P2EWOKI|5|Lovely shirt!
B006W12P4A|1|Spent a full 10 minutes just trying to coax these tights up my legs only to find that the furthest i could get them up was about halfway over the curve of my butt. These did not even remotely reach my waist. what's more...i'm only a size 18/20 and i don't have huge thighs or a huge butt. I almost wouldn't be surprised if these were plus child size. Returning.
B000SP6UVK|3|I got these about three weeks ago, and they fit alright. The problem is, the soles are already wearing thin. This might be expected with the new shoes I bought, as there's white residue left in the bottom of the shoes after wearing. Each time I play basketball in them, I can feel the bottoms shredding. Still, they're so cheap it's almost worth repurchasing every few months, especially given how much work I put them through.
B00BWM89M6|4|Great outfit with all the layers, really love it. Was just a bit small, not huge but enough to warrant adjustment. They do say they offer personal tailoring but did not see this option at checkout. Well made and looks awesome though!  Definitely worth the price. I suggest contacting for personal sizing before shipping, I wish I had but that is my own fault for not looking further into that option.  Also, arrived much sooner than expected. Very nice surprise since we received before May the4th. :-)
B000N8RZ7U|4|excellent product as defined
B00CH5UZJC|4|a little large
B00MX4CGGM|3|Just too small.  I gave it to my niece.  Quality is ok though.
B00274YLGQ|4|Quality is good, it's a solid piece of leather. Dye is good and consistent. Appears to be roll stamped, not hand tooled, but that was expected. The buckle is cheap but I had planned on my own buckle so no stars deducted. Fit was smaller than expected, for which I dropped a star. I exchanged and am happy with the larger size. I wasn't contacted by customer service but I did receive the replacement in a timely manner.
B00F0HF89G|5|Wonderful product for the price. They're adorable and although usually bought for fashion, actually do keep your legs quite warm which is nice. Arrived really fast and an overall great product.
B00PCOK93C|5|my wife love it...:)
B00H5CFKLA|3|My wife and daughter seem to like it.
B005CSOJE8|5|I bought these for my husband.  He loves the thickness and the softness of them.  They fit as expected.
B00FEGVS1A|5|Great watch band. Looks awesome. Every single one does in fact. I get them for my boyfriend and he loves them. Get a different strap for different occasions. Came in a reasonable time as well
B00OYSFE2I|5|Didn't realize these were &#34;women's&#34; socks. Whatever - the patterns rock and I get compliments all the time. Feel free to even mix and match them! Who says you can't wear Mona Lisa and Starry Night at the same time?!
B00NHX64Z2|5|Great shorts. Super comfortable and great quality one would expect from rock revival. I love their jeans and now their shorts are a favorite of mine as well.
B0019F7NYQ|5|I really enjoyed wearing this stylish, perfect-fitting hat on the beach. I would enjoy it more if I hadn't left it on the beach on Cancun, unfortunately! Must buy it again...
B00CPWPBBO|4|on the small side but I'm small. Warm and light.  Snaps a little bling-y for my taste but no biggie.
B00MFWL3CK|4|I absolutely love these! They look and feel nice, and they are SO comfortable. And they fit perfectly. They are made of nylon and spandex, so they have more of that rubbery (bathing suit type) feel to them instead of cotton, but I like them like that, makes them more comfortable to me. And there are definitely no panty lines with these! They look to be decently well made, and my only drawback is that the seams looks like they may wear out easily. The way they are sewed looks just a little sloppy, just a little. You can't tell until you look at them up close. So we will see how they hold up. But over all, this is a great deal, and I will probably buy more of these.
B00CERCNFM|5|The normal price for a nice pocket square is over $50, this one came in at less than half and it looks great!!
B00BCG24TG|2|Way to big to be a 32 waist.  I would guess I would need a 30 inch waist in these paints.  Returned.
B00338GS0M|5|Love the metallic ink, and the message is a continual reminder.  I do happen to ride a unicycle as well.  Shirt quality is great.  I bought the brown one, and wouldn't mind having it in another color.
B00KAI6WEA|2|The 2 zipper  bars across the shoulders were very distracting in a negative way.
B00Y04LFX8|5|I adore this dress. I was looking for a Summer fun, cocktail, dinner out, party dress. Then I found this, it emphasizes my sexy shoulders, hides my tummy (my tummy is my huge trouble spot) and shows off my legs. I am 5'7&#34; so length is  inches above my knees. Oh, and my tummy is really my problem area I am size 6/8 got the small and it looks fabulous! So happy!
B00W854YSO|5|Great tunic!!!
B00JQ88RUM|1|When I took the dress out of the package, I noticed immediately that there were stains on one of the sleeves and also a run on the front right in the middle of the chest area. Even though the dress looks nice in the picture online, the type of polyester fabric that is used for the dress is of extremely low quality - like the type you'd see in cheap sleepwear.
B002YQ2GAU|5|Capezio has the best tights for dance and they price here is always better then the Dance Stores that are local.
B00QOXBI94|5|The colors and print of this scarf do not completely match the image of what is available. It seems to be somewhat \\"based\\" on what is presented. The colors are more muted, with less of the mustard yellow. I actually prefer the rusty color and cafe au lait that I did receive! The fabric is really soft and drapes as well as any viscose rayon would. The sewn in label states \\"Polyester,\\" however I strongly suggest that it is rayon because of the softness and way it wears. These colors would be fabulous in the fall, but if you favor naturals all year long, this scarf will spark your wardrobe 12 months a year! Any brown or rusty shade would come alive with this piece, but there is also a touch of gray in it as well. Happily, I received a sample for review, and this is quite a nice neutral scarf that can be worn any season. Additionally, there is a dainty net storage bag with a satin ribbon pull closure -- very sweet!
B0003DKV94|5|VERY GOOD Once you use these you will never go back to the clip on ones, &#34;PERRY SUSPENDER&#34;  iT'S THE CATS MEOW.
B00D3P7GG0|5|I know the nature of this item is such one doesn't know what pattern will arrive after ordering but I could not be happier with this sarong. It's wide enough to reach from my hips to my ankles and long enough to wrap around 1 and a half times. Perfectly long enough that I never have to worry about it blowing open in a wind. It's breathable and soft, perfect for humid weather. The pattern is incredibly colorful and loud which I do like.<br /><br />It arrived incredibly sooner than predicted. I was expecting a much longer wait. I'd highly recommend purchasing these if your looking for a cotton sarong. :)
B002ALPT3U|5|Fit is perfect. Wanted to use them for work & they are perfect for this. Very comfortable & dark enough for a work shirt.
B00NOAL0F2|5|Loved this got it as a gift for my husband and when he opened it he loved it. Loved the way it fits and holds up well
B008JRUSS0|4|The jacket was really nice, but the size was too small for my husband.  I had to return it for a larger jacket and it should arrive shortly.
B0092R88DI|4|It's not too bad but it wasn't really what I thought it'd be. It wasn't loose or like the image at all, it was just a tall skinny beanie like what you get at walmart
B002DGMZGG|5|I purchased this shawl in black and it is lovely and very elegant. It was perfect for my New Year's Eve celebration in Charleston, SC. As an added bonus I got it at such a great price and received it quickly. Highly recommend this shawl and the seller.
B0070YA5Q8|5|the item is as described and as i expected, fit well and fast shipping.<br />the material that is made from is very good
B000GIQVN6|4|FIT FINE WOULD HAVE GIVEN A 5 STAR IF IT CAME UP HIGHER IN WAIST
B0091CYCHK|5|I like this wire-free bra a lot and would buy it again. I would like it even better if I could adjust the straps to be even more snug.
B00266JBGA|5|Cute baby costume for Halloween.  The costume is less scary than the child though
B00EVW095E|5|fits perfect and looks great.................good quality product
B000F8EWLU|5|great thank's
B000N4XFI2|4|If you're fond of the wool hats of yesteryear, this hat will be sure to please. The thick wool construction insulates even the largest of noggins, with plenty of extra length to cover most over-sized foreheads and necks. It takes a little wearing to stretch to size but once broken in, will be a pleasure to wear on bitter cold days. Highly recommended.
B003ZMJ38U|5|I agree with others, seems to be well made and nice and toasty warm. They are not adjustable, but seem to fit fine on my head nevertheless. Attractive and fits in my coat pocket.
B00K1IGNS4|4|Normally fit a US medium - Bought an XL as recommended in the description.  Probably could've gone up to a 2XL, but it fit.  The brown stripes are much shinier than they look in the picture and the faux leather strap is very thin, one sided, semi-shiny fabric that looks a lot more 'faux' than the picture, but it's still super cute.  Otherwise very good quality.  Came with real laces with plenty of length to them (as opposed to the usual silly too-short ribbon kind).<br /><br />The one I got was definitely the one from the picture, but the description said 12 steel bones and the bones on the one I got felt distinctly like thin plastic.  I didn't run it under a metal detector, but if there's steel in there, I probably still wouldn't expect waist training out of this one.  It does offer a little bit of waist cinching, though, and it's a beautiful corset. (Bought from  SZLingerie, if that helps.)
B00CFXUMFI|3|It is really complicated to put on.  It's a lot of material and it's difficult to find the armholes and zipper opening..
B00C7WPSW4|5|These are great socks that fit me well and seem to keep my feet dry. I use an inner silk lining when i wear these socks. I also use them at night to sleep in. My feet stay warm in chicago weather, but I also wear heavy sorel boots with these socks.
B002HREJ0G|3|I really like the raincoat, it fits great & it has a removable liner & hood. But,I had to take it to be mended because it arrived with an outside seam that was not sewn in properly. Maybe this was why it was so inexpensive? I would have returned it - but I was afraid that my size would no longer be available. Luckily, the mending cost was minimal. I would have given 5 stars except for the ripped out shoulder seam. I hope the mending job holds up!
B00015UXLK|5|I bought this bag about 3 years ago, it is great. Even though my daughter is three years old, I still use it.  It is great for short trips with the bag being insulated it keeps juices cold.  The bottle holders also keeps warm.  Since I hated the bigger bags I found this 'mini' useful and reliable.
B0090CKH6Q|5|It's very good. But need to be careful when you clean it.
B00H3G1YJA|5|Great blazrr. Works as a neautral. Love it!
B010TZXI9A|5|These are the most comfortable pajamas I have ever purchased. They are so soft and easy to slip on. I had purchased these for my sister but when they arrived, I couldn't resist but take them for myself. Love the cute print. Couldn't be happier!
B00PEK3E8G|2|It was to small for me
B00K5T7SLK|5|Fits great! Looks great!
B00BYF6F1S|5|Love this shirt. Get many compliments on it. One of my favorite shirts. I wear a white tank under it.
B006TCMWX6|5|Just what I wanted
B002ZBIOFK|4|the outfit was very cute especially with the hat- the leg opening was small for my chucky baby- but he is 22 lb.s with cute rolls- the vest pulled the outfit together- and liked that it was cotton-
B0094GFXKS|5|Excellent belt. Great quality in material an detail. Is made of good leather. Nautical always make the best fashioned products in market
B008U7TFQ0|5|Great quality shirt, fits just right for my kid, graphics were solid, not like someone just ironed it on before it shipped and price was an awesome savings!!!
B0006TI1EW|3|This pashmina has a lovely burgundy color which makes it very easy to wear for different occasions. Even though I have seen better quality pashminas it feels soft, it is thick enough and does not wrinkle easily. Be careful though when wearing jewelry because threads are easily pulled from its fabric.
B004HHO4KO|5|hot pants the button was not strong so i replace it
B00JKYG8XA|2|Received during football season but didn't wear due to its a weird red.
B00N515HRC|5|I'm very satisfied.
B00ETSMC50|5|Never wear hats that much but I love this one and wear it ever since I got it, since its black it goes with everthing thanks again amazon for such great saling products and prices..Gina
B001KW0BZG|4|nice belt but falls apart in about a year.
B00LFUT0T6|5|i bought the blue and the coral ones they are amazing the cloth is different be careful
B0067LQX6G|4|Very cute, but more of a shirt, NOT a dress, item was shipped and received fast!  If you don't mind this item as a shirt, I recommend!
B00KZBLWCO|4|Loved it!! It fits just as I expected it to. I received so many compliments on it.. Light and comfortable.
B00F1U8EJI|5|Absolutely great. They kep my feet warm and comfy, have an attractive design and were generally as described. I would buy this item again and would certainly recommend it without hesitation.
B005AQW430|5|I have purchased several hats over the past few years as a result of the scorching sun burning the top of my balding head. While each of the other purchases were great for most occasions this one is special.  Not only does it look great and fit perfectly but it is a traveling companion.  This is one of the few hat designs that you allows one to pack the hat and have it restore itself to its original shape (well almost)when retrieved for use.<br /><br />The hat is made of kangaroo skin and is light on the head. Unlike my Stetson this hat does not retain finger prints and the rugged appearance fits my weathered and rather aged appearance.  That is not to say that a younger individual would not benefit from the great style as well.
B0018P1ECY|5|fit as expected, arrived on time. Very happy because Levis 560 jeans are hard to find in Puerto Rico
B00IHPLHKM|5|I am a tall American woman at 5'10. This comes down to just below my butt. It wraps around my body at first but due to the silky, stretchy fabric, it doesn't stay closed. I'm alright with this because I didn't buy this expecting to hide my body. I bought it to look sexy and I do!!!
B00STZX77G|5|Love this!
B003VUT4V2|5|Cool shirt--just runs a size small
B004GMHBWS|5|I ordered this tie clip for work, it looks great on my dress uniform and some of the other people want one too, LOL!!! It shipped quickly and looks sharp!
B002U3EIHG|2|I bought this hoodie cause of my love for a show that FOX never gave a chance. When I received it I regaled in its fine silk screening until I put it on and put my hands in the pouch in the front and it with the smallest of tugs I head a ripping sound as the stitching came out, It was along the the seam that connected the pocket to the shirt. I still love it and I am sure I will get some nice comments on it. Who doesn't love the Bluths
B00FM3OUII|4|I like this scarf. However its not truly made for cold cold weather. Its perfect for Arizona cold weather. Its knit but not a tight knit. Very nicely made. I do like it & will wear it.
B000644BR8|5|These are solid suspenders. I bought some heavy wool pants and needed a way to keep them up. These suspenders absolutely fit the bill. They are well made, they are a great price for what they are.
B003ESZQZY|5|GReat sale fast shipping.
B00E5OMFL4|5|These Gloves are soft as butter when i wear them they make me feel Rich and sophisticated. They were on sale for a great price, glad i made this purchase.
B002XITV2K|3|Very good quality and my girl looks amazing
B00EBXUUHU|5|Just as ordered...perfect size...didnt shrink after washing and color stay true without bleeding. Fits perfectly and get many comments on it.
B00P15CMVE|1|Ugly and I'll fitting
B0050SC7I0|5|This is a very nice well made scarf and we were impressed by the workmanship and the materials were much nicer than we expected.
B00BW02W9Y|5|This coat is very nice quality.  It has a cloth liner inside, so that it can also function as a light fall coat or windbreaker.  My daughter is a tall 2 year old and the 3T fits well, with some room to grow.  As a bonus, she loves the design and asks to wear it whenever she can.
B00LEOFLVO|5|Great color match to Columbia jacket bought earlier this year!
B00KDSFCUM|5|I've been using mine for a few months now and really like it. The magnetic clip is strong enough to hold money without being so strong that it will erase the card data for the cards I store in there (except for hotel keys). The bigest plus for me is the id window. That was the main thing I was looking for in a money clip and it is a great feature. Also the card slots are snug enough that nothing will fall out, yet not so tight that it's hard to get the cards out.<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with the clip
B0029Y2KNA|4|Overall just as presented.  It is just a little larger than expected.  May blow off in a windy day.  Would like adjustable option but quality is there for pricing.  Good product.
B00C7IM1M8|5|excellent, just choose un size above the US  size. I'm normally medium, but on this brand I choose XL based on previous customer commnents. fit excellent.
B008MB4IIY|5|This cover up is the best.  It is exactly as described and looks good covering any swimsuit.  My boyfriend loved it when I had my black swimsuit under neath and a red swimsuit....so it is very nice and works with anything....
B000G7BF1U|5|Great shirt! Better price!
B001NSG4Q2|5|This is a pair of pants in which I have room to move around with comfort.  The expandable waist is perfect for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.
B009RTNI3G|5|Well made and great fit. Arrived on time. The printing on t is high quality and seems that it will last.
B002DYRAQ8|4|A great looking black Cadet hat with an Old #7 JD emblem that I think is one step above wearing a baseball hat. However, the sizing is just a little bit small. This hat is offered in two sizes: S/M and L/XL, but the S/M is sized only up to 7 (or 56cm) which makes it a tight fit on my 57cm head, so I can only wear it for a couple of weeks after getting my regular crew cut. Since it has no provision to be a flex-fit, I'm sure the L/XL would be too big, so I couldn't even wear it at all. Cool hat though!
B00FGFQ75Q|5|Did the job for costume party. Fun and surprisingly full
B00HBBZLNW|5|My daughter is 5 months pregnant and she loves this gown. It is extremely soft and comfortable. She likes how easy it will be use for nursing when the time comes. We highly recommed this even though it is a bit pricey.
B00CWIE1DK|5|Softest zip hoodie and pants on the inside , very well made.
B00ETFQHO0|5|great
B00OQWIWYE|3|This jacket is really short. I'm 5'7&#34; and it doesn't even reach the top of my jeans.
B009XB61IC|5|Great belt, great material, trustworthy brand name. Worth the money and I would definitely buy it again. If you're looking for a reversible belt (black/brown) waist 32 -- look no further.
B00DMNG3QW|3|Order a size up in order to flip it.  If you wear a small buy a medium.  Its too late for us.
B00MOQF2H4|4|My husband is an avid angler and he loves this cap. My only complaint is that the fish skeletons on either side of the wording are actually a very pale gray color, which makes them almost invisible on the tan fabric.
B00BJEV5DW|5|Only one phrase to describe how I feeI about this dress: &#34; I would buy them in every solid color or every print!!!!!&#34; Does it say enough!!!!????
B00GHMS0VG|5|yes, this was a Father's Day present, and it went over very well.  The color is pretty similar to what is shown in the picture.  It's a more subdued blue that goes well with the comic print, giving the tie an aura of classic comic book reminiscence.  Very classy, and not too ostentatious.
B000X5ZZ2A|5|I ordered this dress and it came in 3 days. I'm wearing it for prom this year and I was nervous buying it online because I am plus size. But the dress is great, very formal yet could be worn as a party dress. It comes with a sash! I was very happy about that. Totally great quality made and I love my color, pink. Great buy.
B008ENQWE8|4|These thigh highs look nice and they fit well (5'10, 130lbs).  The only reason I didn't give them 5/5 stars is because the silicone top, though it does help them stay up, is very frustrating with the lace.  The silicone backing sticks to itself and to the lace and makes it very difficult to get all the lace to lay flat.  However, this is partially my fault for purchasing lace-topped thigh highs with silicone.  Aside from that they were an excellent purchase.  Plus, it's a great price for two pairs of stockings.
B00KDCBM7A|5|My waist measurements said that I should go with the small but I saw all the reviews saying to go smaller than you think so I went with the extra small and it fits great. It came fast and very good strong quality!! I love it already! Unfortunately I just found out I'm pregnant so I won't be using for awhile:/ haha I was so excited to wear it! But things happen for a reason(: just wanted to say how awesome it feels and looks!
B0015NBGN6|4|Okay, I have a shirt with this design. I love it although the green hue of the shirt is much darker (which is better) than on this image.<br />It would suck if the actual shirt really was that bright. Or didn't have sleeves. (though I must stress, I don't know exactly how this shirt will look if you order it, I assume it will be identical to the one I got in a department store 6 years ago and I've seen sold elsewhere.)<br /><br />But who's the idiot who wrote that Zelda is kneeling? Zelda is a girl's name. (Nintendo for some reason got the name from F. Scott Fitzgerald's wife) Zelda in the games is a member of the royal family. As for the main character that you play as and is depicted on the shirt, his name is Link.<br />I am amazed this common noob mistake wasn't caught by someone in time.
B003HN02V4|5|Fast Shipping and just as advertised. No issues with this product. The quality is for one or two uses. Will post more after it is used.
B005LR3BMG|4|I bought this purse for work.  We had to have a bag that you see into.  Worked perfectly.  I also use it for the beach/pool because it so easy to clean.  I
B007IVQWV0|5|i will give this to my father in law. im hoping he will like it, bec, i had one tyvek wallet and i love it.
B004UPUFFG|4|Very cute, it would probably fit a 1-year-old or older toddler better though. Made well, and the colors match the images.
B00EHAUWGG|2|TOO SMALL!!
B00C4DB32A|5|Good, but very small inside regardless of the size.
B004T8GZQC|5|Simply The Best
B0071B07Y0|5|fits well, the size is true so order your size, i went a little bigger and that was a msitake, the size is very true for a change.  Fits well, no wrinkles and was perfect for what I wanted.
B00NIQJVTY|1|many black naps sticked on the skin or cloth<br />Not good.
B00D4L28HK|5|We'll made and very happy with pants set. Haven't washed yet so may need to update but this brand seldom let's us down. FYI: size 4 fit 4 year old perfectly.
B00BNB36ZG|5|Scarf's pattern is very pretty, size is big yet is light weight. Perfect for Fall and Winter. Price was awesome too. Just don't expect it in 2 days. It takes about 2 weeks to receive.
B012XVWD5S|5|I love the way these panties fit my body, they are so sexy and makes my curves look even better. The added ribbons on the side makes them look even more beautiful. The sheer lace material feels exceptionally well on my skin and they are comfortable as well. They don't rise up when I walk, they just conform to shape of my butt and hips. They are the sexy panties that you can wear everyday so I can be sexy and comfortable, which is a win win!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.
B00JGHMY0W|5|THIS TUNIC TOP IS THE CUTEST, NEATEST, FABULOUSLY WELL MADE WITH VIBRANT COLOR EMBROIDERY! THIS IS A &#34;MUST&#34; HAVE FOR ANY CHILD LOVING PEPPA PIG.  THIS IS THE MOST FASHIONABLE TOP!
B00802XC46|3|They are longer than 28 in the inseam, more like a 30 but it is ok. These jeans are better suited for someone with a long body from waist to crotch and have very deep front pockets.
B002ALXW2U|3|I usually wear a 36c but this 36c was too big. I felt like I needed to stuff the cups
B000FH7EDY|5|the best. love these pants.
B00LCQ8QQG|5|Well tailored, looks good, seems well made.
B00DYVHYC4|4|Haggar in general fits as expected, my only suggestion is that they mark the style of pants in the inner lining along with the size for future purchases.  Also like to see them come in with no fold marks.
B00WZ5K6PW|2|It's pretty and looks like the photo but XXL was a little tight for my boobs. So I am sending this back because my large 40DD top would not fit this.
B007IA8PAW|3|as good a pair of shorts as anything you would buy on any discount rake. fair priced. brand new quality
B0080BLVD6|4|I bought the xox small for my 3 year old daughter, who ways approximately 30#. This size fit her great, just as you would expect a leotard to fit. It is a little loose in bum, as she has nothing to fill it up;) she loves the princesses and it has held up well for the three washes it has gone through in a week.
B002FKOFKO|5|Thank goodness I found this costume.  I think it's great and surprised anyone would have a problem with it.  After all it is referring to \\"illegal\\" aliens; not legal aliens.  Why would eBay and Target remove from their shelves?  Since when are a \\"felon's\\" right to freedom of speech given more priority than the law abiding citizen and legal immigrant's?<br /><br />I will not buy from Target or eBay again, and I was an eBay power seller.
B00EEERQC8|5|Love it
B0046I6RGI|5|Great shirt.  My daughter loved it!
B00E5LRN28|4|Really light and comfortable. I was hoping for more pleating in the back, of which there is none.
B0069LNTZW|5|he looked sexy as hell and wanted to keep him in them
B00K5AFQ22|2|I returned it  just wasnt what I was looking for
B003PBTEPI|5|This straight leg jean helps fit a fuller calf and thigh.  My husband was very pleased with the  fit.  The jeans arrived quickly, too.
B00AIJXGSQ|3|Fits good through the shoulders but if you have something in your pocket the seam points out.
B008X3BHYY|5|Fast delivery and great price.  Fits as expected, soft texture and really cute design.  Love this!
B00ECHHUNM|5|Great!
B003Y3BDW4|5|For those of us who need to wear pants with pockets (in my case, for an insulin pump) you know how difficult it is to find just what you want.  These sweatpants are wonderfully soft - 80% cotton, wash well, and the pockets are deep enough for me.  I have bought three pair, since I never know when I'll find these again.
B000LKB5VM|2|Sizing info is not reluanle
B003HH3NEI|5|This wig surprisingly fit great for the price.  I bought this for a joke but all of the women wanted to try it on since it looked so good.
B008VEI5O0|2|Too big at cup
B007I9F43Y|5|Literally exactly as pictured, stretches how you need, I wore it over a wig and it looked great
B00KYKDMX8|2|Size is not accurate I purchased this for my 10 year old and had to give it to my 6 year old. Haven't washed them yet so they will probably shrink.
B002KLMV2W|5|This Incase case is awesome as it is lightweight, fits well, and comes apart easily.  While I haven't thrown my iPhone around, it seems like this case is pretty tough and doesn't show wear and tear much. And this color is beautiful and unique and led to many compliments within the first week.  I was looking for a hard case that would protect my phone well and not add bulk which this case did exceedingly well!
B00R10PBIS|4|Fits very well, took forever to get here
B00009P8BP|3|These boots are comfortable to wear and seem to be a little bigger than a standard size.  Eventhough they are not leather, they are good for everyday use.  Only problem I have had is with the heel, it seems to be a little weak, and wants to bend in when you are walking.  Quality is equal with price.
B00VFMC3JI|5|I am very satisfied with this suit. I am modest and also pregnant, so I was looking for ample coverage. Most pregnant ladies just wear a bikini but I don't feel comfortable exposing so much skin. This is actually very cute and enough coverage that I can walk to the pool in just this, or go to a pool party in just this, and not have to worry about using a cover up. Now, it's not geared toward pregnancy but I figured the flowing fabric would be helpful, which it is. The only downside is that the skirting will likely float up when in a pool, which may get annoying, so I am probably going to pin it down. The bottoms are little shorts that match the top, and so if it does float up, you will not be exposed. The fabric seems to be of very good quality and not delicate at all. Also, VERY good for busty women, as the top portion gives much better support that most one-pieces. There are molded cups that are thick enough to prevent your nipples from showing as well.
B00AYZC95U|5|Finding red t-shirts for my 6'4'' son has been a nightmare. He's all torso and most Tall shirts, well, aren't tall. These were perfect. They are well sewn and a nice thick cotton that hasn't shrunk yet. I can't tell you how wonderful it is for my son to participate in gym class at school and know when he lifts his arm his shirt won't rise half way up his chest. I am ordering more in different colors for home. Thank you!
B00543ZQD4|5|Good deal here for quality product
B00PIAPPYI|4|Great
B00AVBFH9M|5|Nice
B00CGGD404|5|Nice skirt that I like it.
B00PACH4T8|5|Great boys shirt, sized perfect. Shipping quick
B007IOG474|5|They are a perfect fit and soft!Would definitely order more in the future, bought these as a gift for Christmas!
B004UIGK3E|5|Love it
B00B1T5YSC|3|The material did not fit flat in the back around my bust line. I guess if I were larger through my chest area it would have fit better.
B002GHCHQ0|2|This is the first disappointment in a Carhartt item in tall. This sweatshirt is not nearly as heavy or well-made as one I bought last year from amazon, and it was more expensive. It is very short in the back and in sleeves, but front is marginally OK in length. It is tight around the waist in a LT. It simply does not cut it at this price. Perhaps at $25 I could forgive the problems,but not at this price.
B00BIPYHLE|4|It is a nice leotard for the price. It fit my teen daughter well.
B006RB6FF0|2|some parts was too small and it was not bright as i expected hope i have better luck next thime
B00Q8V7X9G|5|Love them. I'm wearing them right now
B009UPWMM0|5|This dress is so pretty, I highly recommend it to all little girls, it was very well made. Made a perfect gift!
B00AJN1MWI|5|Fits well and works well
B00NTZSV1I|5|Bought these for my son. Cute colors no great value.
B005EAZ1M8|5|this toy product is an awesome wig. it is durable, though when you first brush it out you lose a couple hairs but that is fine with me. i reccomend a wig cap if you are to get this product. this was the best 26 dollars i have spent. i still use it and its a great sakura length. THIS PRODUCT IS SOOOOO WORTH IT!!
B00LQE37SG|3|but nothing special
B00EVLVPNK|2|I bought one of these last year and loved it. Bought another one last week and it itches like crazy! Yes, I washed it before wearing it but am soaking it and will wash it again.  The band was way too small. I had a 40 before and this 42 is smaller.  Made overseas by cheap labor perhaps.
B005PJT6HY|5|I was unsure how it would fit without trying it on, but was extremely pleased.  It was delivered in three days although I only selected standard shipping.  Wore the jacket to a ball that my organization was having and received tons of compliments.
B0002TORBM|5|My husband has always sworn by Gold Toe Socks, so I figured I'd try the women's version.  They are your basic sock - but I'm impressed by the quality of the fabric and the overall elasticity.  They seem to be passing the test of time - i.e. they are lasting well - but I've only had them a few months.  I would highly recommend them.  Gold Toe really is worth it.  I'll stop making fun of my husband, now....
B00N6ELPY2|5|Like picture. very pretty for work.
B004XBTFZI|4|Very warm, a tun of room in the chest, but a little too much at the waist. I should have gone for the  3XL but I can tailor the waist to make the Jacket fit better.
B0084N1P90|5|Nice tie and well made!
B00LSDT34C|5|Thin but really cute... Fit as expected i got an xl because i'm a 36ddd ... Ok update...i wore this yesterday and omg!!! Heads were turning... It's sooo beautiful!  I love it! Must have ....
B00GDF3IBY|1|Love the hoodie but not the I ordered.  I want a bigger size please I can send the small one back !!
B00AVBFH9M|5|After looking around at the various \\"Ash Ketchum hats\\" out there, this is the only one that even comes close to accurately resembling the logo design on the hat as shown on the television show. The hat itself is of fantastic quality -- a great embroidering job on the logo, a durable feel to the materials used in the white and red portions of the hat, yet very comfortable. It seems like it would be simple enough to \\"get it right\\" when replicating this hat, and yet Swagge is the only one that has.<br /><br />The one issue I had was that Swagge opted to shift the hat's front logo slightly to the right, in order to visually balance the logo with respect to the hat. Visually, it makes sense, and depending on what you're going for, that might be fine. However, if you're looking for authenticity to the hat worn by Ash Ketchum, the shift is very noticeable and off-putting, even from far away. Don't let that deter you from ordering from Swagge, though, as not only are they the only ones who come close to an accurate Ash Ketchum hat, but they're also accommodating enough to get it right for you. Maybe shoot them a message before ordering (or during the order, if that's possible) and specify that you would like the logo centered. The centered version does an amazing job in recreating the look of the show's hat.<br /><br />This is the hat I'd recommend for ANYONE looking to add Ash's iconic cap to their collection. Or, if you're cosplaying, get this Swagge Ash Ketchum hat, and pair it up with Level Up Studios' Pokémon Gym Badges. The only thing that would make this even better would be a baseball cap design where the back is solid, instead of the mesh \\"trucker hat\\" design, so that you can turn your hat backwards like Ash occasionally does, and it'll look normal. But hey, that's a tiny detail. Perhaps they're working on that for the future. ;)
B007LNBWYW|4|Not the thickest winter sock out there, but thick enough to wear with a work or winter boot.  The color is a nice charcoal grey.
B000S6ICTC|5|The material is what is descriped and fits perfectly. This is the second pair that I bought for the same size and same color. Love it
B007IJ7932|4|Little bit tighter around the bust than the black w/ polka dots.  Still fits, but might have gone one size larger.
B00IWJGLFY|5|Excellent
B00LEY6GJK|5|Perfect fit!!! Sizing was accurate! Perfect skinny pants with &#34;liquid&#34; look. I love my new pants, I'm ordering more!
B00PGTNZWK|5|Very nice dress, but thought it was more appropriate for someone younger (younger than 55).
B00BJX0EYE|5|fit well and look wonderful while wearing white pants. :)
B00GK3J2AU|5|Great price for the shirt.
B00HQ7DKCA|4|Keeps me warm!
B004VPBY9Q|4|I need a larger size Large USA. The one i ordered a smaller one. Please.<br />Thank you
B009O8MQWE|1|I was highly disappointed in this purchase. I ordered 2 of these tops. They have no tension and I see no way that these could have any type of slimming affect due to the poor quality and thinness of the material. Do not waste your time or money. Usually jockey has great quality products but this is just sad.
B00CHQ5JQK|5|Like the previous reviews show, this robe runs EXTREMELY large! I bought it for my son and even though it is huge, he still loves it. He can fit both him and his girlfriend in it. The quality of the robe is excellent also.
B010NDHYQQ|5|Great suit at a great price!  Received the suit in two days and love it!
B004SE8XOY|5|I purchased this for a sister and she loved it, the color was nice in person, and loved the length. Thanks
B002X0JDKS|5|I got this as a gift and I somehow ordered the dark blue(I swear I opted for the light navy) and I do not like it as much but I hate returning things so I hope he will like it! Update: He loved it! He wore it right away even. It was a direct hit... pretty sure the death star rolled over in it's grave!
B007U3I7QO|5|Very cute on!! Lots of complements!!
B00VOTSAIA|4|Arrived sooner than expected! I'm a medium but ordered a large & it fits perfectly! My mom loved it so going to order one for her! Definitely thumbs up on this one.
B000SKLTIO|5|EXCELENTES CONDICIONES, ORIGINAL Y EN BUEN ESTADO, RECOMENDADO! ADEMAS DE RESPONSABLE Y CUIDADOSO EN EL ENV&Iacute;O, NADA DE TERRAZOS ...
B0002TORVW|5|Gold Toe socks are very well constructed and comfortable to wear.  Does not hurt that they look great also.  Would purchase again.
B00MMW9K00|5|Woah, this sweater is the best sweater I've ever had in a long time. It's so soft and big. Its kinda like you can wear it to keep warm but you can also wear it in the Warner months. It fits me perfectly. This sweater is perfect. It came earlier than expected too.
B00NP94JKK|5|Cute.
B00HN3TPAS|5|Outstanding product for an unbeatable price! Exceptional seller.
B000YAOZNY|5|Soft and sexy, and the pink one is beautiful. The size is free size as mentioned in the product description.
B00829QTII|5|nice
B002QYTGFS|5|This is a great shirt for any BSG fan. Any passerby who is also into BSG will get a kick out of it as well.
B00Q5FYHSA|5|Good Quality T-Shirt
B00WWSNNSE|5|Interesting pattern, soft material, folds nicely down the front of me. I love the colors,  a soft red, white and blue. Feels very carefree. An enjoyable, cool sleeveless blouse. And the price is right! Have worn this a couple of times and someone always comments of the design or thee look of coolness it projects.  LOVE THIS BLOUSE!
B00CL0HPX2|4|This is very thin, will use as gift but would not buy again.
B00FA9CL4O|5|I ordered this dress for an upcoming cruise for Captains Night and it is even prettier than shown and fits spectacular!  Great value, great price, great dress!
B00597GCBK|5|I love these tops.  The white one is a bit see through however so if you're wearing it alone be careful.  Nicely made, stretches as you move and is soft against your skin.  Keeps you warm under other tops too.
B004PBRGUC|5|Super cute and great quality.
B00EQXPA3O|5|good value for the price
B001DLGWKM|1|a small t-shirt provides better compression than this. they must have changed their material or something.
B009B9R2IE|5|I wear a 9.5, and they fit fine.  The socks fit right up but to the knees, and didn't fall down.
B00FY7VF1C|5|Beautiful
B00UW3MN14|5|Perfect
B00KFXLGZA|1|Way too small!  I ordered a large and it looks like an extra small.
B004E0OSNC|5|This is the FIRST strapless bra to ever FIT and SUPPORT me. I am a 34 F, so ordered a 34 G since a few reviews that said they ran small. They sent methe Euro size equivalent, as advertised and AMAZING! Pay attention to the picture and description. There is no padding or lining. There is a silicone edge to help keep it up. The bra is not suitable for anything close to being low cut, as it is high between the breasts,but maybe that is why it works for large breasts! I have never been so thrilled to buy a strapless bra!
B008L4KW50|5|This was exactly what I hoped it would be. Generously sized and almost ankle length (I'm 5'7'') and good quality. I haven't washed it yet, so shrinkage--if any--remains to be seen. The color was perfectly portrayed, no surprises.
B00CEH0PIE|5|Perfect not to big not to small
B00B4JWXAG|4|It worked for what I needed, but I still felt like a cow.  I did appreciate the modesty piece for the the breast area.
B00AO7F6C6|5|Fits great. Looks Great. She dances in it. Colors are bright and pretty made very well. Every one likes it.
B009AMUTS2|5|Awesome.  Love the fit and feel of this shirt.  Colors are vibrant and the quality of the shirt is excellent.
B0072LCVLQ|5|I bought the tank top shirts to wear under my blouses at work and they are perfect!<br />The sizing is good, the texture is good and the quality is good also.<br /><br />Thank you!
B00F5T1DGQ|5|Desperate for an &#34;ugly&#34; christmas sweater that wasn't gonna cost me an arm and a leg. I am 5'3 and 137lbs and this fits me ALMOST like it does the girl in the photo. It's long like a tunic [rests just above the bottom of my butt] but fitting in the chest [32 D] and arms. It works for what I wanted it for and it isn't itchy, which is a plus! It's fairly thick and a nice quality for the price.
B002UKQ12O|3|Good price.  Insulated vest with flannel shirt sleves, no insulation in the sleves.  It's ok... you get what you pay for.
B000AO59MU|5|A New Stocking Design.<br />I saw them when I visited Isreal.  They looked so sexy on the woman wearing them so i bouhgt a couple of pairs when i got back here.  I wonder what they would look like if a dark purple was used on the lace top and vertical stripes?
B009Y9QCCS|5|Love 'em so far, warm and well-fitting, and MADE IN USA!
B009LEG2TO|1|I bought this shirt for my sister. It is terrible material and fits all wrong. I am second guessing buying anything online again
B007WAF9LQ|2|for starters. im 5\\"6 118lbs 34C. ordered a medium and this thing is painfull to wear. its so tight on my waist, i hate it.. im not a big person, im thin so i thought a medium would fit great, but i was wrong, the waist band part is weird and shifts a lot and fabric bunches in spots on the waist band.  and if you have a long torso DO NOT BUY! i  have a short torso and its barley long enough for me.. the shorts are a lot longer in person too, to me it looks off.. .. kinda mad that i bought this but o well, live and learn.  i have come to learn that im not really a big fan of this seller, a lot of their clothes are cheaply made (and look cheap), but what do you expect with prices like this?  i just stoped buying items from this seller and i have been happy since..<br /><br />:)
B000CRU952|5|This buckle is hot!!!  This design although popular makes a very unique statement. It is made of a great quality pewter, so it is durable and qualitative. On the back of this buckle there is sticker that says,<br /><br />\\"This is not a toy.\\" The points on the sides that make the cross are wicked sharp! Not sharp like a blade, but, if the right pressure is applied, it could cause harm.  So be careful.  This buckle, although small can work for any style or personality.  Get it, you'll love it!!!
B00I1AI8GE|2|Ugly colors. I sent it back.
B000OTRDN4|5|Excellent brassiere made ​​like this, it really is a good strapless plus they are full size.
B0098PKYWW|5|Fit perfectly and was light weight.  Good value
B00CRXCOOI|5|my favorite company.  if only these came in bigger sizes for when my toddler outgrows these.
B002QDFUHM|1|Lowest quality costume I've ever seen. It's being returned. Headpiece is PAPER. Costume is way over-sized. Supposed to be for a toddler, but would fit most 5 year olds.
B00U6WXBAS|3|It's really pretty, and I wanted something to wear on hot summer days. I read the reviews about it running small. I am usually somewhere between a large and xL, 14, sometimes 16 if it runs small. I ordered a xxL thinking I would be good. Nope too small. I got it on, but I couldn't move. I would say it is equivalent to a usual med. So xxL= M, xL= sm, and L = xS. If the sizes go any lower I wouldn't buy it unless you have a childlike frame.
B00266P3UI|5|1. The size w31 -L32 of this pants found out to be bigger than the same size of Levi's jeans. but can be freely put on with aa belt.<br />2. I did not like the material. It is thin cotton and all in some kind of pressed in small boxes :)<br />In the picture it was not seen that these are summer pants
B007JS4M6E|2|There is a lot to like about this sweater.  I liked the length...good with skinny pants.  Very pretty color.  The style, open at the bottom, is attractive.  The problem is with the collar.  It could be described as a buttoned turtleneck, and it was shown as such in one illustration.  It looked OK on the model.  But you really cannot wear it buttoned up and unbuttoned it  falls into a lumpy messy looking affair.  So I sent it back.  Too bad.
B002AHNZ4Y|5|My daughter lost her original one and I found this one and she will be so excited for Christmas since she thinks I threw her other one away, which I didn't but now she will have a new one!
B00GPIDXVE|5|Love it wear it all the time.
B00JLZM65M|5|my daughter loves this jacket, great for school.
B001TPA77Q|4|This is a very handsome looking wallet.  I like that this wallet was designed so that the id window is on the outside so that you do not have to open your wallet to present your identification to anyone.  It has a few card slots on the inside for credit cards.  I like the good quality craftsmanship of this wallet.  The only minor gripe that I have is the money clip.  The clip on the money clip is not tight enough.  It is too easy for the money to slip out of the money clip.  But other than that, this is my favorite wallet for a night on the town.
B000E0SZXU|5|I have wore this bra for a number of years since having back and neck issues and am well satisfied with its comfort especially as I have an intolerance to many synthetic materials so finding not only a cotton bra but a support one is well - Comforting.
B00FN8DUQU|5|Great product! Only wish there was something written on the front or have a pocket.
B00KKBSUFQ|2|The item was too small. Arrived on time. I even bought a bigger size then needed because I read the reviews and it still was way to small. Wore one time and won't wear it again!
B00PDHHF6M|4|Nice fit. I just would like to have the OPTION to roll them up or leave them down!  Not everyone wants to wear their BERMUDAS rolled up! These ones are rolled up and stitched in place. I had to cut the stitching so I could roll them down. OVERALL, the fit is accurate. These are a &#34;KEEPER&#34;
B00N1FVPWI|5|So soft and comfortable…I am 5'4 and 118lbs…I normally choose an x-small if I can, however the small size fit perfect. Patty's tops are the BOMB. I have five now and I am addicted. Enjoy!
B002UIJHHM|3|Admittedly, for ordering it online and not knowing the sizing of this particular company, it's not bad. Although the bra itself is not all the comfortable or amazing, I would order from the company again. I feel like once you know the sizing and what to expect as far as the material and overall fit, it's easier to narrow down what will work for you.
B003CVN2TU|5|I ordered this shirt for my husband for Christmas. I am sure he is going to love it.<br /><br />Shirt is great quality- not thin and cheap like a lot of graphic tees anymore.  The graphics on the shirt look great too.<br />Order arrived within the estimated time.<br /><br />Thanks!
B000X22SBO|5|Works like a champ!  I got more!  I hand wash mine.  They've look great and have really held up well after many uses.
B00HQCXOUI|4|It's soft looks good. I'm 6-1 215 big upper body and the xl fits great. The xxl is way to baggy not really any longer.
B000PWWRCM|3|The product does work but it tends to curl up at the top edge... Making it feel like a rope is wrapped ard your upper torso... Not the most comfortable feeling... Had to head to the restroom to make constant adjustment...
B002ZE5ZUY|5|The best beanie i ever bought, it was excactly what i pictured it to be before i bought it....What topped it all was when it was delivered early..... :) finally got my money worth it.....
B00LW778O6|5|Got my purchase very fast. Love the shirt to workout in.
B0083QM178|5|This is a great buy! Very soft and comfortable. It looks adorable on and fits as I expected it to.
B002B8HR5A|4|The tie was truly black with a nice sheen.  However, the tie was wrinkled in a way that was not caused by the way they folded it.  It wasn't horrible.  It was only for my son to wear for an orchestra concert, but if it had been for a job interview, I would have not worn it.
B00I5RI1JW|5|Good
B00CASJYA2|5|This outfit was well made and I can not wait to see my daughter wear it this summer!!!  So cute!!!
B00BD4BI26|5|LOVE this bra! Highly recommend. No &#34;bra&#34; marks/lines under t-shirts, no wire, super comfy.
B009P833UW|5|Very soft substantial jersey, with a nice drape.  I wish it were 100% cotton, but for the money I am pleased.  The 2x I ordered floats a little large:  it may shrink if I overlook the &#34;cold water, low heat dry&#34;, but I don't mind if it doesn't -- better loose in summer heat.  The tunic hangs long on me, slightly below crotch level -- I prefer slightly shorter, and it will be easy to take up the hem.  Scoop neck scoops pretty low on me, about as far as I am comfortable with.  I really appreciate the sleeve length.  I have large upper arms that I am self-conscious about, so these cover me,  and protect me for sun exposure a bit.  Easy to roll sleeves up above elbow on warmer days, or fully down making this appropriate for at least 3 seasons in New England.<br /><br />I'll look for more Woman Within Women products based on this positive experience.
B00BWM8ARU|5|This product is awesome. I love this costume. I bought boots and a light saber to go with it. It was well worth the money. I really like this costume and would recommend it to others.
B00008IPA9|5|I love these stockings! This is like my third or fourth pair and I wear them with everything. They're surprisingly durable as well. Great for adding a little rock 'n' roll to your outfits.
B000VZM7VY|3|They are really cute, but the ruffles show through everything but the thickest pants (like denim). Also, they are a little smaller than normal sizes at first but quickly break in.
B00S3SCTBE|5|Nice bra - fit as expected.  I'm a 36-C.  Just enough lace to be pretty without being silly.
B00EWND5Q2|5|Look out my heads in the ozone
B0047DZGKK|5|I ordered two of these suits from these people This one was perfect in all aspects. Make sure you order this particular type . The others are far too small and do not meet the figures on the size chart.
B00D1WYPQO|4|fit just right
B00B4QVYRC|5|sooooooooo cut
B0058D1PU8|2|There is not much support
B00FXPSUFE|5|I love this dress that fits well I'm a woman with curves Plus being pregnant I mean this is the console dresses for your  breathable but it's very comfortable love the colors its just for spring and summer I'm going to wear this dress to my step daughters graduation from high school and it looks so good in it awsome tan brown sandals just look good
B00J2A5PZO|5|As described, good quality
B00K72J5CA|5|Another win! Love the dress!
B009MS0N4E|4|Used for a con and it was great!
B005IBKPM4|5|Great
B00BF3294Q|1|This suit was too small not as pictured and returns are taking forever, will not but from her again ever.
B00028B5H2|5|Great pants
B00FT3AB7K|5|This scarf is true to color and is very soft. It is ideal for cooler weather as it is a heavier material. Looks great and can be worn with an outfit or simply with a coat when going out in the cold. Would recommend to friends and family.
B00GUYU53W|5|I really like these leggings! They have a lining that makes them warm for the winter and they fit just as they are sized. I will buy more in the future!
B00Q5FBLXE|5|I like it! Once i get the logo put on you won't even know!
B00GC3FC7K|3|the design is pictured on a size M. on a size XL the \\"belt\\" is very small and looks odd. boyfriend didn't care for it because if this. yes it's a goofy shirt for a christmas parade, but it would look better if the design extended the width more on the larger sizes. we put his biker vest over it~ problem solved... blue was true to color.
B008CJ976Y|3|Very simple.  The fabric looks dyed almost, as if it will fade after several washes.  It is very comfortable and fits fine according to the size chart.
B003K6R7T8|3|such a cute dress, and i was so excited to get it. however... i ONLY recommend this dress if you are on the smaller end of \\"plus size\\"... i generally wear a 16-18 in dresses, and got a 2x in this, and it was EXTREMELY small in the bust and was also very short. i gave this dress 3 stars because it is darling, and the belt is very cute... but be sure you order up a size or maybe even 2. i just dont see how this is a plus size dress. i also would not order this dress if you are very busty... i would say a 2x amounts to about a size 14. i wish it would have worked out for me!
B00IAMW8BE|3|This ran smaller than I thought it would, even with reviews saying it ran small and ordering a larger size than I normally wear. The quality is OK. I ended up not wearing it because I thought it looked chintzy and I was headed to a wedding. I may pair it with something in the future.
B004MC9940|1|Horrible ! This was sewed together, was given for a gift and didn't notice til too late to return.
B00DHA1SE2|4|Good
B00138L32M|5|Good item and keep u cool during your workouts, Im 6´ 190 lbs, body fat 11% and Size M is perfect
B00KGIGSXO|1|These socks are built for very small people. If you're wedding party is over 6 ft or has a shoe size above a 10, keep looking...
B00IW5E5JM|5|I love this jacket!  It is so well made and fits wonderfully, they really do customize the fit based upon your measurements, even accommodating my long arms.  If you're looking for a cool, but slightly dressy distressed leather jacket, buy this one.  Communication by email was expedient and thorough.
B00265CKZU|4|Having read other reviews, I went ahead and ordered a size smaller than I was planning. For the most part the smaller size fits just fine. I am petite, so there is a bit too much material in the waist. Adding a few gathers and darts, as well as shortening the hem, and it is a cute costume.
B001DLGWLG|5|Does the job
B004FN1KL6|5|This is my favorite hat now. I absolutely love it. I wear it all the time. I can dress it up or down. I tried to get the regular brim hats but they were always too tight. This one is just right!
B007EUXDP8|5|These shirts are loose fit, but cut right to still accentuate your build.  Bigger, built guys will like the extra length, and generous cut.  I love these shirts because it feels like you are wearing nothing, and there's a variety of colors to go with any shorts or pants you wear.
B000O1AULY|5|Great T-shirt, well fit for adult size. Nice design.<br />Love it! I recommend it for quality and fast delivery. Great
B000LUU6AI|5|Great support without flattening! It passed it high-impact Zumba test, and was not difficult to put on or take off. This is my new favorite sports bra.
B00FC1RYA6|4|This is a really cute top but it did not fit in the bust.I typically wear a 38D. I was trying to stuff my boobs into it because it was a great length, not too much flow, and great colors. However, I couldn't keep em in there and feel comfortable.
B00PIAPQUG|5|LOVE THESE!! Look good.. Stay put AND are comfortable!!! Where has this been my whole life!! I always thought they were too expensive for me!! Like only for rich people and celebrities.. And I have NEVER found a strapless bra I could wear that would stay.. These changed my life!! No more bra strapes in nice dresses for me!! For the first time in my life I can wear things with one shoulder or strapless things!!
B00GYZ290Y|5|Great shirt!  Perfect fit!  Love the material- so soft and light for summer!
B000Y8ENPQ|5|These are great slacks.  They have substantial weight to the material, they are well made.  The fit is good, I really needed a 35&#34; waist, so a bought a 36&#34; for comfort.  I would recommend them to anyone and will by more myself.
B000QHC66S|4|Not quite what I expected, but still great! I was honestly expecting the grey cloth bit as shown in the picture, and while that might've been a mistake on my part, the rest of it looks only a little wonky without it. It also arrived with one of the ears bent out of shape (tried straightening it out for a couple of weeks, which helped, but it still curves off to the side lazily). Fits like a glove, though if you have a good deal of hair (like me), you'll find yourself binding it out of the way if you intend to wear it for longer than a brief try-on. Sturdy, flexible, and not overly sweaty.
B00JAE4FN0|5|Not only is the price great for the quality, my daughter loves it. She is 4 years old, 43&#34; and around 31 lbs. She normally wears 4 or 5 T clothes and we ordered a 5/6 in this coat. Delivered quick and very cute! I highly recommend this for anyone searching for a good, heavy, cold-weather, winter coat.
B00AQB1XMW|1|The straps are very thin and weak. They do not provide any support for a plus-sized chest. The worst part are the cups which are flimsy and drag down your breasts. Not at all attractive or comfortable and I have tried several ways to adjust or pin the straps/cups for more support, but no luck.<br />  I would not recommend this suit and I should have paid attention to the previous review which also said there were issues with support.
B00PQCWW08|5|Made my daughters Christmas.  Great quality and super fast shipping.  This was a super purchase from a first class seler
B00EVLG5TY|4|I usually get more classic dockers.  These have a little bit tougher feel to them, but still look good enough for the office.
B000EMYIQG|4|I am a petite woman, and this skirt fits me perfectly.  Looking forward to wearing it to a Sock Hop I am attending in a few weeks!
B00729YCOW|5|ENDO rocks.  I always love ENDO products and am very happy with this shirt.  Like most of their products, it is sort of an inside joke to anyone who knows about firearms.  Great product.
B00EBCAFCQ|3|Fits fine. Something about the material makes me itch. No matter how many times I wash it, it makes me itch. I stopped wearing it.
B002ETVLZ8|5|Perfect for rain and snow
B00EZE639E|4|l love this skirt, have received numerous compliments.  True to size, fits as if it was taylor made for me. great for winter, fall, and early spring.  Ordered an extra one, as I was unable to find anything in this area that fit correctly.  Am a shorty, only 5'1.  Wish you made a jean skirt that was 24 or 25 inches in length, would &#34;hit  1-2 inches below knees&#34;.  Would buy again, and did!
B0074Y6BTE|5|Perfect pants
B00LGRJ7L4|2|The belt leather has hardened。
B00F57GA3O|5|No complaints.  It is exactly the shirt that I expected from the online description.  It fits well and the color is true to the online picture.
B00544BVX2|5|I would own one in every color, love it.  They maintain their shape and color, look like a tank top underneath sweaters and tee shirts without layering up so much I burn up underneath.
B00MCNFER2|5|Nice looking hoodie. Good quality. fits as expected.
B001JBNDLM|5|7 pair of briefs for $8
B0018OKZ9S|4|Mainly for the cheap price but the cutting is not good. Levi's use to be very expensive trade. Guess need to reinforse the QA procedures.
B00HVAUQEM|5|Love the style of this dress with the black and white stripes and the mesh accent top. The fit was very flattering, true to size. Great work dress, would be a cute party dress too!
B00DQBBDZG|5|Very light weight, sheer.  Will be nice for hot summer days.  Decent price so even just for around the house.
B00C2RYJSI|4|I love the dress it is different from my other dresses beautiful and not to short perfect fit just like I wanted
B00O8FSVSG|5|These are great fitting pants! I am usually happy with all my NYDJ purchases.
B00COJKG3Q|1|Their measurement chart is for the fairies.  I matched, but I spent all that money and now I can't get my big toe into it.  Eff this.  Cute dress, though.  If you're a Size 2, order the XXXL.  I'm serious.  And THEN be prepared to give it away to a broomstick, after you miss the return deadline.
B00SR8EQ4S|5|Love it. High quality fabric. Fit perfect!
B00IZGLK8W|5|Nice
B0058YHJX4|5|The price is also very comfortable to wear can be a<br /><br />The brand is also looking forward to this price jacket
B003YJBYPE|5|I hesitate to use superlatives to describe socks, but these are the best ankle socks my feet have ever worn.
B00H8VSWQI|5|I love it.  It is soft and comfortable.  I will probably order another one in another color.  Great sale and love the product.
B00F0N879S|4|These are overall pretty comfortable socks. They fit as expected, the material is thin (but not too thin). Once they've been washed they shrink though- they still stretch back out to the point where they fit comfortable, but they look TINY coming out of the dryer. I got the size 9-11 socks and if they shrink any more they'll start to get too small - I wear a size 7.
B003ZV1OZQ|3|Not sheer as described, but a good closet staple.
B005GNNZ1C|5|Hard to find a DD that is comfy AND pretty - this bra fits the bill (and me too!!!) The price made it a great bargain.
B00BF8GOWE|5|Very nice fitting bra for someone who is large chested! It supports and yet isn't too much
B003Y4WVMY|2|Started falling apart after second wearing!<br />it is poorly made, belt is as wide as the opening of the buckle so it doesn't slide through easy.
B00IR70SH8|5|Beautiful! Fast shipping. Same as described it.
B00D7WFOAY|5|I have had absolutely no problems with this product as of yet. The stitching is heavy duty and made to last. The magnetic clip isn't the stiff one position type that can wear through the leather around it leaving the metal poking out , but instead easily opened yet holds your cash securely when closed type. I have 6 cards and my ID currently in it and it is a VERY tight fit. 3-4 cards and your ID would be about right. Overall very satisfied.
B003M8HZBO|2|The vest is really of good quality, and the size fits as well. However the zipper fastener is on opposite side as it should be for girls. For others this might be a negligible imperfection, and of course the seller has to inform about it in advance.
B00OW1XCQW|5|Very comfortable!
B0052GJQFW|3|I love the shirt, but the sizing is all wrong. Runs about 2 sizes too small. Wish it was long sleeved.
B005EQT4S4|1|This shirt wasnt really a eye catcher for me so I ddnt expect much. I ddnt realize that there was so much extra material at the top of the shirt, and I have a small waist so it looks kinda weird on me.. for the price I paid, im sure I could find atleast 2 more shirts that look better. Ill go with the more v-neck shoulder top shirts now. So im returning this top today.
B00JOPWEFG|5|Fit perfectly...LOVE IT  :)
B008F6G2EY|4|he wears it all the time for its comfort
B00FACPWMO|4|Material is ok and shipping was quick. Suit was way too big but I got it adjusted to fit. Great for the price
B00BUJ0OGA|5|Nice hat
B00GVI8H1Y|2|This coverup is one size fits most, and from the picture it looks flowy enough to where I thought it would for my 6'0\\" medium sized frame fine. This coverup was designed for way more petite women. I would not order if you are over 5'5\\".
B000TJMLPY|5|Good old fashioned fit and feel. I will order more. My Granddad wore Key overalls, and I know why now
B00EPXR6GY|5|We needed to dress our son up for his first formal night on a ship and it worked perfectly.  Looked nice and traveled well.  Really happy with the purchase for the price.
B002O1F2MO|5|This a really nice vest, well made. Looks to be really warm. Love it, so did my grandson. Sure will look for more of your products down the line.
B00GSVXL9W|5|I Love this nightshirt.  It is so soft, fits true to sizing, not clingy,. I will buy another and it would be a great gift for a friend you want to feel comfy. I highly recommend it!!
B000P52YW2|5|I wasn't sure what I would get for the price but these Fruit of the Loom shirts have proven to be good for the price.  My husband changes t-shirts every day so these have seen a lot of wear and tear but have held up quite well. I bought the x-large size thinking they would shrink when washed but they didn't.  They have held their size and shape which was a big surprise.  Next time I will buy the correct size now that I know they will hold their size.   I would buy these again and would also recommend them to others for a good buy.
B00535JGNE|4|We love the designs and quality (they actually stay on babies' feet!) of these socks, but be aware that they run in incredibly small. Our daughter (50th percentile so the definition of &#34;average&#34; in terms of size) out re her 0-12 month Trumpettes at around 4 months. We melts stuffing her feet into them for a few months but finally decided to purchase another pack. We love the look of these 12-24 month skater socks, but they fit her well at 8 months so i have a feeling that she'll outgrow them far sooner than the company would have us believe.
B00KACVBH4|5|He loved his gift
B00N3DKXYE|5|I love it
B004WT6KEU|5|I am very excited to give this buckle to my husband for Christmas. I was a impressed when I opened the package that the buckle is nice quality and a good weight. It isn't light and cheap feeling, its perfect!
B00FPHXS1Q|1|Way too small. XL fits like a small.
B003D7UHKA|4|It worked well for the Halloween event that I had. The feet kept spinning around my shoes and the mask was a pain to wear, but for what I wanted it worked well.
B0088EYPJM|3|It was definitely pretty good in the beginning, looked great, felt great. But after about a month of not even using it at all the little Swiss Crest on the front came off and really made it look undesirable.
B00EE1Z4NY|5|Love It!
B00JGG7K4I|5|The quality of this bathing suit surprised me. It looks great, not too sexy but still cool for a one piece. It fit perfectly, however you really do need to order two sizes up. I'm usually a medium in most things so i ordered an XL. I've used it as a body suit with shorts and it made a pretty cute outfit~
B00OK3411M|5|They are gorgeous. I bought one for two of my daughters and myself. They love it too.
B008IRQPCO|4|I bought this for my girlfriend so she could wear something in the colder months. She quite likes the feel of it, and she is partial to the style as well. I'll have to mention that the sleeves are not lined with fur (as per protocol with women's coats nowadays), and the insulation is best paired with something else warm - then again, we're in Ohio, so it all depends on your climate.
B007CE4Z8U|4|I am not the person who like to wear Halloween custom. This is good I can at least dress something for the fun day. I wear a long sleeve shirt inside, when the weather is cold.
B007CAKJ8E|5|these are so cute. the green totally shows up great despite how it is sort of hard to see in the picture.<br />i am fairly thin i guess, but even for me, thigh highs do that thing where they are super tight at the top on the thigh and make my thigh muffin top over them. super unattractive. these dont do that though!! they are stretchy enuff to not muffin top yet they stay up just fine.<br />i love these. also got them in purple and white, i like those too. (not as much though, im more into dark colors ;) )
B00HAJQUAI|5|Very good,just a little small.
B00FP2YGIU|5|These pants are great. They fit perfect and are super comfortable. I plan on buying a few more pairs.
B00LD1DSNG|5|This one is like wearing pajamas to the office, but doesn't look like them! I wear with leggings, boots and a scarf so I can dress it up or down.
B0000ZBTVE|2|These briefs were extremely skimpy. The ones I got at Wal-Mart were better quality. Their 3X were larger than the Bali 4X. I cannot get the Briefs from Wal-Mart because they do not offer them online and I am no longer able to drive. I thought Bali was a good name, but I guess not.<br />Very dissapointed.
B00Q2OQJ76|4|Great shorts. I bought them to replace a pair I was very impressed with. Sad to say they have been made more cheaply in both the weight of the material and the belt. But that is to be expected these days.
B003EAHFAG|3|we reached for boxer briefs as opposed to these for our potty training toddler, however theae would be just fine for an older boy who os already trained
B000KGKBOY|5|Really warm, great product.
B00PRWFO34|3|Buttons was missing
B001OEJLHE|2|I didn't expect it to be the best quality for the price, but I liked the color and figured I would give it a shot. This one is better left for the little 13 year olds thinking they are cool with a shemagh. It's so thin just putting it on my nails were going through the fabric, and even doubled over you can still see through the fabric. If you are just looking for something to pair with a shirt or whatever then go for it but I would just say spend a little extra and get one that will last more than one or two wears.
B00SARL09U|4|Very well liked thank you
B00O5D3UQY|5|Great light weight hoodie for spring and summer evenings. Got the size larger than usual as other reviewers suggested and it was just right. Light weight makes it more shapely than most hoodies. Bought two more.
B012PPR2NU|1|It Looks Different Then It Does In The Picture , The Colors Are Very Different From The Shoes
B00I9GVCZY|5|Sooooo cute!!!!!
B00T2SPJ84|4|These are great. Nice stretch and the pattern is very cool. They won't work for running (too stretchy and no pockets), but will be great for a gym work out or yoga class. I got the size small and wear a size 4-- fits perfectly.
B002WYKGJC|5|Good
B00928XTRC|1|Amazon!!! This about to go VIRAL on facebook. Take this down!! Sick and you should monitor your site alittle bit better!
B00CM6BXC4|2|This wallet was given by my wife on Valentines day, by June that same year it as ripped on the center pouches. I've had a front pocket wallet by fossil for 4 times that time and it's still in good condition. Given the sentimental value of the gift I had to glue it.
B00MQO0JQ8|5|I get so many complements every time I wear. It was the same as described and colors are really close to the picture. I definitely recommend.
B00A73QNNS|4|I bought these fans because I have a friend who is crazy about hand held fans. She collects them and uses them for wall decorations. I find they are quite functional for personal  cooling also.  I would definately buy them again.
B00DJ2YJSU|5|my jacket is great. fits well and stops the cold.
B00AUDXGZS|4|Although these panties fit as expected, as a male, they are a bit lower along my waist than others I have.  The lace sides and satin front panel make these panties very sexy to wear and look at while on.  My lady friend really likes them.
B007OWHOUQ|1|Bought the sweater coz it looked very pretty and bright in the picture even though many reviews warned that it is brighter on the inside. The entire sweater is woven inside out making the inside bright and nice and exterior dull. I had to return it!
B0019705C6|4|Looks great and fits well. The only problem is that the sizes run a little small.  Had to reorder a bigger size.
B004YNIU9W|5|This scarf was lovely, and priced very well to boot.  My niece loves it, and says that she gets compliments on it every time she wears it.
B008999GIG|5|These are soft and comfy and a great price! I bought.  A few and glad I did! Great material too :)
B00CWVWBUM|3|This was my first purchase of a ratchet style belt.  The price seemed like a safe gamble to try it out.  Overall it's a good belt and a good design.  The buckle is just way too heavy.  I'll try a higher quality ratchet belt next time.
B00LP6ISAW|5|Ordered other colors.
B00KZLREK8|4|It is a tight fit but I can still wear it. The color is a bold pink, the material is thick, and best of all it has a hood!
B00X52XSQ8|4|Side touching helps to get rid of that boxy feeling and hide some tummy 😉
B002TQ0GWU|3|A little to snug for me. I don't know if it's because it's a button down scrub top but the back tends to flip up. I am a larger woman (size large) but my butt is not what you would call big.
B00B4X47S8|4|I think the necks are a bit smaller as the button at the neck is tight; but the fit overall is fine; the quality is fine.  I just might need to move the button over a bit.  They wash up nicely.  I still iron them - but always iron any shirt.
B006GDANSE|3|Not as tight or strong elastic as I was expecting. However, if you size down, you might run the risk of creating lumps where your butt and upper abs blob out.
B00V8Z4PNY|4|Exactly as advertised, comfortable and unique.
B0049MHEQ8|2|I ordered a size down and it is still huge!
B00CDIETJK|5|Perfect. Looks good.
B00IX0TO5Q|5|Love it, perfect fit, comfy.  This suit is really comfortable and flattering and it does not look like a dress with a huge skirt.
B003QOZBJW|3|Looks better on the internet. A little big and the sleeves end awkwardly. Its fine otherwise. Could be a bit closer.
B00Q5HA3CM|4|Cute, they fit high waisted
B00C6M3VHY|2|Cute skirt and will work for what I need it for. My issue is with the fit. States it will fit 16W-22W. I am a 14-16 and if I were any bigger there is no way that skirt would fit. If you want this because of the description as plus size, I would look elsewhere.
B000F30W14|5|Comfortable and good quality.  Only had black dark blue and gray. No white.
B00HUNY08S|5|I bought two of these for my younger twin brothers for Christmas, and I must say, they nearly did not get their Christmas gift! I wanted to keep them after seeing them and trying them on! (I tried them on to be sure they would fit the twins okay.) They were super soft on the inside and really comfortable, and they look just too cool. The boys were really excited and they loved them, so mission accomplished! I buy them hoodies every year for Christmas, since they seem to lose them every year, and this was by far my favorite one that I've ever gotten them.<br />The pockets were small, don't expect to put a bunch of things in them, but that is really my only complaint. One brother said the hoodie smelled funny, but the smell went away after he washed it one time. I imagine it was a stale kind of factory smell that some clothes get.<br />It's a very slim fitting hoodie, so you may want to order a size up. My brothers are both pretty small and I got them both a Large, and it fits them nice. It's not tight on them, it's a bit loose, but not so much that it looses the Assassins Creed effect that I bought them for.<br />Because I didn't buy the hoodie for myself, I can't attest to how warm it is, but I've seen the twins wear them throughout the winter, so I'm assuming the hoodies are warm enough to last through an Oklahoma winter (which can be anything from sunny and warm to bitter cold and snow, toss a coin).<br />Overall, I think it was a fantastic purchase and I'm thinking of buying myself one that I can keep!
B00K75FSVY|5|Very nice. This scarf is big and very versatile for many different styles.
B0040Z7SLA|5|Arrived before 'deliver-by-date' and was just as described!
B00BLFMEBG|4|Great sunglasses
B00846NE5A|5|I placed this shirt over cardboard cut into the shape of a tee shirt and used this shirt as the guestbook at a NYC themed farewell celebration.  Guests signed the shirt and wrote words of inspiration and encouragement using Sharpie markers.  Good quality shirt.
B00RDL3F7Y|5|It's a great shirt, I like it a lot
B005LTQOUK|1|I would not recommend these.  First ones I ordered holes in them they were returned.  New ones arrived started unraveling after two days.
B008RJUKOW|5|Good choice
B00TLEQ2RG|4|Nice and stretchy
B00IXLLDPY|3|Not bad, but the colors are much stronger / more saturated than in the picture (as in higher contrast) .. Particularly the yellow band is barely discernible in the product photo, but quite bright and stands out.<br /><br />The material feels nice - on the thinner side, but comfortable.
B00CGV6DNY|1|It broke the second time I wore it
B00UF7VA9I|5|Love it! It did shrink a little when dried - but still fits, shouldn't have left it in till all the way dry.
B002G0TXYQ|5|The pins was well made and perfect! very heavy and real metal.<br />The seller was easy to work with and was able to rush the order for a last minute gift for my husband. I will deff order from the seller again.
B000783UCK|5|The colour stays through multiple washings.  They are comfortable and durable.  I have had some for a decade that are only now starting to break down.  They are good enough I came back for more.
B00B8ZEVE2|5|I really love this hat. It does fit a bit large for a female but does not fall onto your face. The hat is made of thick material and it is very warm!! I use it everyday for school. I have had it for about 2 weeks and have had no problems with it. I would definitely recommend this product for both male and female.
B00BCMAQMM|5|I bought this hat to replace a similar type of hat that was showing it's age. This hat fit perfectly and not being wool is quite comfortable. It can be machine washed in cold water just fine and let out to air dry. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a crochet styled beanie/skull hat.
B009HW8IE2|2|This dress cuts way too large for me. I also find the fabric weighing on me and makes me feel uncomfortable. Not keeping it.
B001VMZFPQ|5|this was a gift for fathers day my stepfather is one the hardest people to buy for but I have buying him shirts from the Mountain for years. and he always loves them THANK YOU!
B004C3ROYQ|5|I purchased these for my bridemaids' gifts. They're really beautiful, and just the right size for a little compact or jewelery set. The quality is great, and I ended up ordering more for our mothers' gifts and one for myself as well!
B00JU9GC7C|5|True to size!
B00G204GMU|2|you didn't offer a large so medium was too small as i thought. Since it only came in one size I had to take it.
B00IKCMPNK|5|Love this costume! Impressive to the kids.  Horns stayed on, were shiny, easily manipulated into knotty horns.  Perfect for plus size.  Strong and durable material.  Highly recommend!
B00500YRFY|5|Grandson loves both
B00LU68PM8|5|all excellent
B000KHDNDE|4|A happy find. Not many (no other ?) apparel lines for the awesome Venture Brothers. It is a good quality tee with a great, simple design.  I look forward to some more items with the other characters from the show that Dr Girlfriend and I can adorn ourselves with.
B00F6MAV1U|5|these fit me at 165 pounds (low body fat) and five foot eight inches tall. simple, thin material. great price, no complaints.
B004CVKYAO|4|fit my husband well (at first) and are comfy. have a nice soft feel but still durable. down side is they seem to keep shrinking every time we wash them- but they are 100% cotton. so we wont be drying them anymore.
B00LTCE5IQ|5|This blazer is Perfect, the material exceeded my expectations. I had prompt customer service and its fits to my perfection. I cant wait to wear it for my christmas party
B00CBEF5FS|5|It was exactly what i ordered and even though it took a while it was well taken care of when i got it
B00NZITP4Q|1|Incredibly dissatisfied with these gloves. The &#34;buttons&#34; are actually hot-glued onto the gloves, so unsurprisingly, one popped off about an hour after I put them on for the first time. The design of the pointer finger is crooked, meaning that the &#34;smart touch&#34; pad only covers about half of your fingertip, making it difficult to use. Finally, the stitching in some of the fingers came undone almost immediately. For $28.95 this is simply unacceptable, and I won't be purchasing from this seller again.
B000VPG3E6|1|This product is incorrectly labeled as being for an adult. It wasn't even CLOSE to fitting a skinny 5'9'' adult. I also had trouble getting my refund for the product, although did eventually receive it after contacting amazon.
B00BJNZS9A|5|Well made and very comfortable. One big plus for me is that it has pockets!!<br /><br />Simple design, yet still shows off your inner superhero without being gaudy about it!!
B00KGP86AA|5|Quality product. .. Good busines
B00DUB0I62|5|very soft,I loved it!!
B008QVLXT2|5|Yes, I will recommend it.. I chose the rate cuz I am very satisfied with it and It was a nice gift..!
B005NRKIHK|4|I should have taken measurements before ordering, but let's be honest - who does that? It's super cozy and comfy but the 1X/2X is MASSIVE. I can wrap the robe almost halfway around me again, once it's already on! It came without any papers for returning though so I guess I'm stuck.<br /><br />It's a bathrobe, so it doesn't have to fit exact, and too big is better than too small, but I wish I had been able to exchange it for a smaller size.
B0018ON8JM|3|Husband says the material is skimpy compared to a couple of pair he has had 10 years.  Made in China must have cheated--not the same as they used to make.  He says he will not buy Levi's again.
B00IF48P8W|5|The first thing I noticed was the awesome material and the cool yellow. I don't really wear yellow but I was looking for something fresh for the spring and this fit perfect. It's like a faint yellow and looks awesome!
B00LLS4XL2|5|Love it! Very beautiful
B00P1WTKJE|4|I'm very happy with my skirt. It fit's great. However, the waist was a little loose. Other than that, I am very pleased!
B005444GIE|5|Great Carhartt t-shirt.  They are large in size.  What ever size you normally wear ...order one size smaller.
B00K44K0TI|1|The best news: I wore the costume on Halloween to be funny. Then the next day I took it off, and I was just me again. Isn’t it awesome that I didn’t have to deal with the racism or oppression some people actually experience on a daily basis? Best Halloween ever!
B0015HS05E|3|Not as long as I had hoped.  They must measure differently than I do.
B00AYD8NHU|4|My daughter really loves these shorts, the color is true to the picture and I would say the size fits as expected.
B000PF04RO|5|This dress really is pretty, elegant & well made for the price, it has the under net to make it look fuller and sparkles all over it. IF this is what your looking for in a dress, this would of be a great dress to have, but for us it DID NOT  represent the picture on line when we received it.  When we received it had sparkles all over it which is NOT what the picture showed NOR did it state it in the description.  If it would of stated that it had sparkles or the look of sequence which shimmers or something  to the effect like that we never have ordered it, because that is not what we wanted  for as a brides made dresses.  Other then that this dress is absolutely beautiful.  It didn't work for us as picture did not represent what we thought we were getting and we returned them.
B004M6UDF0|5|Would never go back to normalmwallets its great fits everything i need and holds the necessary items without having the bulk of a normal wallet
B00IX57VRO|5|this is my second Charles River Apparel purchase and both are great items with a great fit. my next clothing purchase online will be Charles River first.
B00K6NVAMI|5|I love this hat!  It's very boho chic, and I like that I can lean it back on head or pull it down low over my forhead. The rims have a bend-able wire, so you can adjust way the sides hang.  Love it!
B000FISXME|4|The stockings are really nice, and give you nice legs. Only pb: the mention \\"intimate apparel\\" on the box. I ordered clothing that was more intimate apparel before from other sellers, and they usually send the package with give a vague mention on the package (like \\"top\\" for a corset, etc.) When your concierge is the one signing deliveries, he just doesn't need to have an opportunity to imagine what might be in the box (especially when it's just a pair of stockings). Otherwise, the quality is excellent and the shipment was relatively fast.
B0084OL7C4|4|just as shown well made, odd odor in fabric 3 days to air it out
B00LNF1XYI|5|It fit my daughter perfectly and she loves the Percy Jackson series. People are always complimeting it.
B007REB0UQ|5|Just as pictured if not nicer. Easy to use and sturdy. Very happy with the product and the speed in which I received it!
B00M7B2OAO|4|loved the shirt just a little small consider getting one size larger
B000K9QNUC|5|I bought this for a friend of mine who lives in Florida for when the temperature dips, he is 6' 2&#34; and weighs 210 plus and says these Walls fit with a little bit of room for long johns underneath. He is very happy with the quality and price.
B003ZMHYPO|5|These muffs are as good as described. I especially like that the headband is velvet - and that's what makes them stupendous! Since the band is not adjustable, I do not recommend them for children.
B00HW1H9YU|5|My husband did not like the small plaid.
B00PXT3XRK|2|I am very disappointed that the shirts still bleed the colors after 10 washings. It would not have cost much extra to have used a chemical to set the dye. I need to separate these shirts out of the normal load and wash them separately. Too much trouble. I won't be buying these again. They are going to the garage to be worn for car repairs. The colors and the fit are great, too bad they keep bleeding out the color in the laundry.
B00CIBCJ8K|5|Very gauzy light weight and nice fabric! Color was accurately photographed.
B0024VFRX8|5|Nice quality, bright
B00D9K6PHK|5|We use this as her &#34;travel&#34; blanket when it is cold, since coats or thick clothing interfere with how well your car seat works in case of an accident, and the hospital baby class instructor said that those after market buntings that go over the car seats can be suffocation hazards.<br /><br />It is SUPER soft and warm.  I wish they made something like this with a water resistant side for getting the baby to the car when it is raining.  I also like the soothing neutral color.
B00IXWE8J6|4|Like the hat, especially that it is crushable and packable and springs back into shape.  It's too wide for my head, but I can add a ribbon chinstrap so it doesn't blow off, and an elastic insert to keep it more snug.  It was hard to find a crushable hat and one without a huge brim, which is why I'm willing to keep it considering it's too big.  It's very pretty, and the purple color is true to the color on screen.
B00HWFCIVU|5|I want more of these! I am waiting till I can order another pair in black!
B001H0F57U|2|Shoulders are too broad unless u are a body builder.  These are destined for garage and cellar wear where comfort trumps appearance.  When will a manufacturer be honest enough to show their product on real people, past there 20's prime and designed to make them feel go when they look in a mirror.
B008AQD7KQ|5|Love these shirts.
B00JUM4IKW|4|Nice hoodie just a little smaller than expected
B00EHYK94M|4|This was a gift for my father-in-law and it arrived in great timing and fit exactly how we thought it would!
B005T5S1AC|3|Its Okay I Dont Think Its Worth $20 But Watever My Boyfriend Will Like It & It Glows In The Dark So It Says So We Will See.
B00AQLLIRM|5|This jacket is great I just gotta make sure it dont get dirty. How do I Clean it.
B007XVVMJW|5|been using this for work and my colleagues we're really impressed on how this skirt emphasizes on my legs. makes me feel sexier!
B00C9TXZZW|5|I've never bought a costume online prior to this one but I must say that their sizing chart is perfect and the suit fits true to size. I purchased a medium and it was so body hugging and accentuated every curve perfectly. I loved it and so did everyone else. The compliments would not stop the whole night. Definitely a great buy ;) Super sexy
B00HTM0MGY|2|A very decent coat for the price.  But, sizing is all wrong!! I ordered XL....it fit more like a M. Could not use it!! Gave it to a niece. Not pleased with the sizing!!!! :( Elaine
B00OBHF9BI|4|The tassel is frayed with some strings coming loose at the bottom. Other than that it's a beautiful skirt. The material isn't stretchy but the elastic part of the band is hidden in the back, so there is give in the waist. I bought the dark blue and it's very pretty. I especially like the black ruffle at the bottom. I'm 5'8, medium build and the skirt goes down to my ankles.
B00CLE540O|4|GOOD
B00QAFU31A|4|attractive yet stunning
B006NO99EA|2|large and snags on everything
B009IAJV6M|5|I hesitated for a few days to purchase this coat - and really there was no reason to wonder. The quality of the coat is just fabulous - and living here in Chicago this winter - it was perfect with the arctic cold air we've been having.<br /><br />So don't hesitate - get this coat!!
B00ZFE1RDK|5|This swimsuit makes me feel sexy, retro and super comfortable in my own skin. It look so good on! We women tend to be harsh when it comes to our bodies, especially in bathing suits. I was so pleasantly surprised at how much I loved it! Highly recommended.
B00I03RL1U|5|Wow really sexy dress. I wore this to a wedding and I got so many complaints. I really was blown away by the price with the quality you get.
B00DM3YL34|4|After several washings these are wearing well.  No complaints!
B005CSP03W|5|I bought this thinking I'd use in cooler weather, when it came the temperatures dropped and I used at once.. It's great like it better then Hoodies I have to put over my head. It's cozy and warm. Will look into other colors to buy
B003652VEY|4|The material is very soft and comfortable-the raspberry colour looks great even if you you have a tanned skin! I enjoy wearing it.
B006GG07JG|5|Very nice product
B007VUOVA2|5|BEEN LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT LIKE THIS FOR A FEW YEARS
B001GZUQ9S|3|I thought these wings would be completely different than the wings I find at the Dollar Store.  They are certainly sturdier and jewels in the center (which is a nice touch) but the frame, fabric and elastic is same.  I can only hope they don't bend or tear as easily....
B00NU76MFW|3|Just not sure I like the way it fits.
B0031QMMBA|5|I use it as a work jacket for when my winter coat is just too warm. Had it embroidered with company logo. Will more than likely order a few more for the other employees.
B0085JEFU4|5|This is a very pretty hat. The fabric is durable and the colored pattern can compliment numerous outfits.  The sizing is similar to other  Zutano hats, runs on the small side. I would recommend the purchase.
B00LY6A3T2|4|Good.
B005XBXO9U|5|I am a short gal, barely even 5'1'', and 120 lbs at the moment. It looks great on me. I just lent it to my friend who is very tall and skinny, and it looked great on her too. It just kind of conforms to your body and definitely flatters it.
B00JFHJF78|4|I have received several favorable comments on this coat and don't laugh, if i don't gain wait it will be fine. I usually wear a size 6 but this does run a little small.
B00B01HPBU|4|Love this t shirt, it is in jr's sizes, I normally wear a large, so I got the XL, love my new TARDIS British T !!
B000OQL8DI|3|Xmas gift!
B0097JHF0S|4|As per my wife the dress was nice however the material used could have been better quality fit was ok
B004YAROGU|1|This did not stick!! The glue was hardened.
B00ND3CBAI|4|Thin material
B00J2D7QUS|5|I'm 5'9\\" 240lbs, 38 inch waist, sizeable rear; they fit perfectly and flow when I walk. Cute with heels or flats.
B00541T7L8|5|Love the checkbook cover and it is my favorite verse. It also has a place to put credit cards in. Very nice.
B009X6Y32S|5|My wife and I (both) have this sensuous slip in black.  We wear them to bed on 'hot' nights. The fabric is just plain exciting as it slides over your body. Short enough to be cool but long enough to cover everything. Give them a try for sleep or play !
B00HHYV7OU|5|Great for after swim class.  Nice heavyweight material keeps kids warm after swim class.  Dries well and seems like it will last a long time.
B0035Y84WO|5|My 12 year old son loved this wallet.  it has enough slots in it for him and is a pretty good quality wallet ans feels like it will last a while :-)
B009373Y6S|5|very good for five degrees with open fingers.  Thin enough for my purse/jacket.  I really do not like the color but it is sale, it is OK.  Nice removable mitten type.  I know that the removable mitten type is warmer than the full fingers.
B00CKGBAQU|5|This skirt is so pretty and comfortable!
B0084YXWNQ|1|i measured my size before i purchased this item and double checked my other pants as well.<br />i ordered this item 10 days ago and it just came (finally)<br />it says 36x32 on it but size is not actually like that.<br /><br />if you want this pant you have to order one size smaller.<br />lets say you are 36x32 than i recommend you to order 34x32 or maybe 34x30 because its taller too.<br />plus the shipping speed is really SLOWWWWW or the company policy depends on company satistaction  for some reason because all my orders came earlier than this one.<br />Even my replacement orders came earlier (which was sent 2days before this item delivered)<br /><br />will return the item for sure!<br /><br />this is all i can say:<br /><br />Different Size<br />Wrong information<br />Slow Shipping<br />Bad Business<br />Horrible Seller
B007GPE8J6|3|I like the look of it, and feel sexy when I have it on, but it is a bit too low cut to wear with a bra (without it showing), too short to trust that it will not show my fat belly when I move in certain ways, and too scratchy to wear for more than a couple of hours. That being said, I kept it. I treat it like lingerie- something to greet my man in when he gets home, knowing it will be removed within the hour.
B00B89Q1XC|1|The jump suit arrived on time but it was the wrong color.  It was suppose to be white Very disappointed I really need a white jump suit, now I have to order another.
B00GXLILWY|5|Awesome shirt despite the fact that it's an XL and runs pretty small
B00Q2OW2AO|5|Love it!
B000P52ZJY|3|I bought this item for my brother he had no complaints.  Im sure they were alittle cheaper in stores however
B002KXSUNE|5|The quality is very nice and the fit is true to a dress size. It is easy to put on and wear because the bodice, skirt and apron is all one piece, with a long zipper down the back.
B00KJBA172|5|Fits cute my daughter loves them and I will buy again!<br />Thank you
B004LY06VY|4|This works, but would have been much better if the fabric was more absorbent. After a couple of hours it was soaked. I am not  sure about the outcome being worn the whole day, maybe  it might come through
B00OQW0ZXA|5|I love it!
B00F77NP1M|5|Great product
B004YO7NXU|5|producto en excelente estado con garantía de originalidad con pronta entrega a mi buzón recomendado para próximas compras este vendedor
B000UZYWPO|3|This bra was not as comfortable as the bras from this brand I had bought in the past. I had a hard time finding my size in stores so I looked online and found this one. The padding is much firmer than what I was used to and doesn't seem to move with my body the way it should. It still covers everything and stays in place fairly well, but still not my favorite. Item arrived promtly and in good condition.
B003XG08MS|4|bought these as under-shirts for judo uniform, these are nice and loose, very comfy. not hesitant to machine wash and dry. very convenient.
B006SRTD52|5|good
B00FGGIK2I|1|does nothing for my rear
B00IMKB0MW|2|My grandson is 6 years old and these were too small. Otherwise they seem to be well made
B004S0PQKC|4|I wonder why women's Tees don't provide really deep V necks? When you have a large chest, the higher the shirt neck, the more bread-loafy your torso looks! I really dug the deep V-neck and the soaked colors of C-In2's Mens Pop Color Tee, so I rolled the dice & bought a medium for myself, a 5'7\\", 40DD, 160lb female. I fit great! Lost 10 lbs, bosoms stayed the same, and now I've 2 mediums, one in this gorgeous Winter Wheat. Not only is the cotton soft, but it's substantial as well (opaque) and does not look worn after repeated washings.<br /><br />The length hits me at high-thigh. It's thick enough fabric and a deep enough V design to make me forego all those Forever 21 and American Apparel tissue-thin t-shirts for men & women. And it's tailored, semi-fit torso beats out the square-shaped billow of the Canvas Unisex Deep V-Neck T-Shirt. A winner all round, gals!<br /><br />UPDATE: While this is still one of my favorite big-bossom shirts (I own 5 in both short and long sleeves), I would aslo like to recommend the Andrew Christian menswear line for it's \\"deep v tees.\\" I 've just bought 6, 4 in large + 2 in XL and didn't anticipate loving them as much as I do, especially since they are made for really jacked up gay men (when you see the modeling pictures on their product pages, you'll know what I mean. They are the deepest V necks tees I've ever worn, but they are no where NEAR inappropriate and they take 10lbs off my frame by hidding my midsection a bit with their 30\\" hemlines! They are pretty expensive, but they have great sales and the quality is a cut above. They also blend of 3 textiles, combining poly/spandex/rayon/cotton/linen. For more details, feel free to see my reviews at amazon.com/gp/profile/AUUVMSTQ1TXDI.
B00ENLQ53S|5|My daughter loves it! Thank you so much!
B00I2T47DM|4|Great!!! It's made of beach towel-like material which works well for after shower/pool use. Very comfortable and soft. Surprisingly warm. Arrived on time and in great condition. I am a larger man so I purchased the 4-5x but probably could have gotten the 3x but you never know about online sizes.
B00LH95MGK|5|Great belt, that I get lots of compliments about.
B001GTXBGY|3|I gave three stars because these gloves were just ok, they looked neat we bought them for my boyfriend to wear to a 80's themed bachelor/bachelorette party. They arrived on time and were a fair price. But they were oddly shaped in the knuckle area and after wearing them for only an hour at the bar two of the studs just fell off...So i mean its not to big a deal because we just needed them for one night, but they are now part of the kids dress up clothes haha
B001ANODR2|4|It's pretty solid and thick sweater, more so than I expected. That's a good thing but could be clunky if you wanted something light. But an XS was still too big.
B000MXB52C|5|I have been purchasing this bra for years and was so excited to find it on Amazon!  This is the best bra I've ever owned.  I am a large woman and the support, comfort, and shoulder straps are the best.  It is worth every dollar!
B00F12B9B6|1|Really bad color nothing like in the pic it's dull and looks like it was made in a hurry  bad bad bad bought another from another seller same size and it's perfect fit color and everything
B008XLVMGO|1|Glamourmom also makes a cottom long top with ruching in the middle of the bust.  This is made from a spandex like material and constantly slides up the belly.  It is not nearly as long as the other one nor as high quality as the other one.  A rip off for sure.
B002JFRM8C|3|The costume was smaller than expected and the material seemed flimsy
B0055PK3ZM|2|The belt came without the buckle.
B0010EKIWA|1|I really can't say much about this blazer, because after over three weeks I'm still waiting for it to arrive!  I attempted to contact Chadwicks by emails (both ignored) and finally ended up calling customer service, at which point I was informed that orders under 1 pound can take UP TO 20 BUSINESS DAYS (read: four weeks) to arrive instead of the advertised 5-7 business days.  I paid $8.99 to ship this single item to a U.S. address - obviously Chadwicks is far more concerned with maximizing profit than with providing a good experience for their customers.  This was my first time ordering from Chadwicks and I'll never order from them again.
B00V7KXIZG|3|Moves around
B002R0GS1Q|4|love the coat but it runs a little small. would definitely recommend getting one size larger.<br />Otherwise it is a great coat and looks nice
B00GNU644W|1|My shoulders are not broad enough for this dress. Disappointed.
B001TH8X4I|4|I purchased an XL based on the reviews that were written saying the shirt was snug, but it is not snug-sizing is true.  Buy what size you wear on this shirt!  I really like the design and the quality of the shirt, but for once wish I hadn't read the reviews.  I am still going to give it a 4 star rating because the quality is nice.
B007PUFZIK|3|this is mostly as pictured - although it isnt a true taupe background - more of a light brown than taupe.  The pattern is very cute.<br />The material isn't soft at all - not itchy but a tad on the rough side - but you really need to wear something under it anyway since it is completely see through.<br />It is cut like a square on bottom - you cant tell from picture so it hangs very large/loose.  I like that but some might not.<br />It is short - a bit shorter in front than back as well.  I'll wear it under a long tank style shirt though.  Gathering in front center could be done more nicely but it is fine.<br />Overall, cute top and I'll definitely wear it.<br />Its not super nice looking or made to last forever but the price was right so I have no complaints :-)
B00TGBCJBW|5|Bought this for father of a one and a half year old princess.  He loves it!
B00LGRXL2K|1|Cheap material
B00EZPZ4A2|5|My son loves Hurley clothing. Your website provided me with a different type of clothing found in NSW & it was delivered earlier than anticipated. The prices were very reasonable Basically I bought 4 items for the price of almost 2 pairs of shorts bought form the stores.
B009TBZTZM|5|Love these!
B00BMQ2KU4|4|good
B00JWWZXJU|4|Snug fit
B00IIJF1T0|5|I had Purchased these slacks and they were to small.  So I got another size and I am very happy that I did.  They look &#34;Great&#34; on and fit so nice.  What I like about these slacks is the fabric.  They can be worn to work and after, and still look very classy.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />F.E. Manuel
B00ALZ24Y4|3|its a wallet. nothing fancy. just plain old tri fold wallet.
B00KVBT8BA|3|I will echo so many others here: bottoms a bit big, top a bit small!  I even feel like I'm a slight pear shape so that was unexpected.  The top is just so strange in its cut.  The cups are not placed well, in addition to being too small.  The wires sat too far forward.  I didn't mind the rigid shape of the cup as others have complained about but some re-evaluation of the sizes would be nice.  Someone with a behind of a particular size will probably need a larger top.  SUPER cute, sad to send it back.
B0081ZQOV0|2|I wish it had zippers for the pockets.
B0000A78MR|3|I purchased these from another store when they were going out of business. I was happy to find my size. Not the greatest fit in the inseam. The pants wore well, except for there because of the short inseam. They lasted me less than a year, but were worn 5 days a week in a retail enviorment. If they had not worn out I would have added an additional star.
B00MO85OZW|1|It took way to long to get here and it was super small
B00CTUVN6O|3|Fantastic but it is too short. Not for long torsos.
B004OWSLHY|5|Best coat ever created! Reading other reviews that it runs a tad bigger so, I ordered a medium tall and it fits perfect. I 6'1 215lbs athletic build and always have trouble finding enough length in my sleeves.  This was perfect.
B0014UHNCS|5|Excellent material , great fit
B00CQS9PUA|3|not stiff enough to rock my Rockabilly dress!  will need to find another solution or add another slip.  Like the lining that keeps the scratchy netting away from the legs.
B00BBB3GIA|4|Wore this dress to a 20's themed wedding. Everyone at the wedding loved the dress. However the dress is slowing losing strings and the feather on the headband was extremely small, despite that I would purchase from this company again. This dress/costume was a good deal for the price.
B008ACEBYG|4|I purchased this blouse for my daughter. The embroiderey is very attractive and the fit was perfect. I would recommend this blouse.
B00480K2C4|5|Love the functionality of all the pockets, and the fit. True to size, and very flattering... Part of my weekly wardrobe!
B00KCVOV3E|4|Ordered these the package when ordering  said briefs but when I got  them the where high cut briefs they are ok ,I still wear them
B00KOKWGOY|5|I got this hat for my Father. He really likes the style and fit of the cowboy boots that Tony Lama makes also.  He likes the hat, it fits well.  The size chart for this hat seems to be true to actual size you are getting.
B002MR5126|5|I was very satistfied with the quality of these boots! They are wearable for more than just costume use!
B004Q94BQU|3|It was ready to put on, works greaton thighs, but ineffective tummy control.  It appeared to eliminate my muffin to also.  Simply wasn't what I expected, but will keep it.
B00B30HPC2|4|Very cool
B00KIRB3RY|5|Definitely a good buy for someone with a little tummy.
B00JZ23AW4|3|Cute but to teeny. One size does not fit all. And I west 10-12, so they should fit. They are really made well and oh so very cute but just know they ruin REALLY small
B00FQ94NRQ|5|This is a very well made shirt. I like the color and the size was about right. Will definitely recommend it.
B009I66ACO|5|These fit my daughter perfectly!  They are so cute!  They are also a wonderful replacement for pants when my daughter crawls.  She doesn't crawl out of them like she does the pants!
B00B4GFP7M|4|Fabric as nice for the summer and the design was exactly as pictured. However, the sizing was a bit off and the dress fit larger and longer than my usual Medium.
B00G9AWL0W|5|I received the product on time. The were reliable and trust worthy. My product was new condition. I like the long johns I bought from them. It is very comfortable. It is very warm.
B00B2G604Q|5|Good fit and my son loves them, he feels like a 'grown up' wearing them. Would recommend to others to purchase.
B00IX112CS|5|Very nice swim top
B002WOF62O|4|Beautiful kerchiefs, but they certainly need to be ironed after washing.
B005NRPH0I|1|huge
B0041LQIZU|5|It fit perfect!!
B00AMQ1DQW|3|This was suppose to be a child's large. My daughter is 8 and very skinny. This outfit was much smaller than I expected. The bow on the front fell off with first use.
B009VPGDCO|5|My son's favorite Christmas present.
B003BNZ3H8|2|visible lines
B00H9N2Y4G|5|Pants to long
B00697OVSK|3|I ordered these jeans after a long hunt online. Size 24 is not easy to find!! And most cobalt blue jeans are a powdery blue whereas I wanted a bright rich blue. Amazon offers international shipping for this so that was another plus, although the shipping cost was quite high.<br /><br />The order arrived VERY quickly. I placed the order on Sunday night and I had them Thursday evening. Pretty impressive!<br /><br />When I opened the package I was a little disappointed. The jeans don't look as they did in the picture. The picture is clearly edited. The colour is as if you take royal blue and then mix it with powder. It's a plain old cobalt blue, nothing like the dark, Zara-ish blue jeans shown in the image. Perhaps the seller needs to consider the difference between a picture for a magazine advert and an online shop. The picture is the only guide for an online shopper to get an idea of what it will look like and this should be as true to the original as possible.<br /><br />Colour aside, the fit of the jeans is amazing. I wear 24 and this 24 fits perfectly. The material is also comfortable and feels like quality stuff. There is a bit of lightening of the colour on the seams of the ankle, which gives it a more casual look but otherwise the jeans are nice. I just hope the colour doesnt lighten further with use. My sister who hadn't seen the picture quite liked them.
B000YALVH2|5|Great little booties. Highly recommended for first year.
B0045DIT6K|5|Keeps the head warm and it's green like Kermit. Fun fashion. Woven well and fits great, looks like Kermit. No issues.
B00GLGVR8G|1|I ordered an I Love Winter Springs key chain, luggage tags and tank top and would've appreciated being notified that these items would be delivered as I Love Florida instead. I also ordered some I Love Florida items as well, that were correct
B00COG8XG6|5|Love LSP!
B0081T9BXE|4|These are great looking on, but need to have a full seat.  It's a little small and it cuts in the seat.
B0009GD62O|4|the fit is on the shorter side but the comfort levels are good. the only complaint is the elastic is a bit too stiff but for this price its worth a shot
B000N62M8Y|4|I had one of these when I was in the service. It's practical, it's smart, it is quite durable. If you want fashion go somewhere else.
B00MMY7R0S|4|Cute shirt, runs a little small though.
B008B803M8|5|I normally wear a size medium with a 34-36 bust and an XL was a good fit. Fit this curvy size 10 gal a little snug at the hips though so make note that it is a junior fit and you will have to gently stretch it at the hips to accommodate a woman's body around the lower extremity. I love the look and my kids were all about the cape! A great purchase for this year's Halloween get together and also plan to use it in 5K runs this year as well!
B00F6JJSUI|5|These jeans are so comfortable I will definitley recommend them to all my friends and family I love them very much thank you.
B006GHCJVY|4|Great warm winter gloves. One star down because they are a bit large and very loose around the wrist.
B000IXR4CQ|3|Its huge! It doesn't fit my preschooler even when velcroed as far as it will go. It fits both my husband and me. It is pretty cool otherwise. My lil guy still tries to wear it.
B0060FHQYM|1|The picture is great. Material is terrible and the dress is SO short.... the fabric that isn't sheer comes half way up my butt cheek. Very disappointed. It reminded me of a night gown, not a dress. I won't purchase from this seller again.
B00GJ74I92|3|Wasn't expecting so much texture. Not really a dress shirt.
B007W0XL20|1|NOT SMALL --VERY SHORT  I am a woman of only 5'3', and the torso of this garment was so short I cannot wear it. Unless you are below 5 foot tall this will not fit you
B005HJ7NTK|1|Very small around the top. Did not stretch well. The first time my girls (high school softball team) wore them they tore where the breast cancer emblem is.
B0055FFM94|2|Nice caps, but too small.  Fit children, not adult heads.  Especially after washing (in cold water, and air dried) they were too tiny.
B00329M35G|1|Garbage. I understand its rubber as to be safe for kids & whatnot but what a waste! The rubber is so flimsy it literally flaps in the wind when you move your hand while holding it. Not even remotely realistic.
B004SWJF5M|5|...but that was my own fault since they didn't have my size. I have since taken them in where needed. I wanted Dickies because I have been happy with my past experiences with this brand. I purchased this in two colors.
B00ISLKGEI|5|I can not wait for my little one to wear this outfit. It's warm and comfortable for those long Sundays at church and I won't streason about accidents.
B00CHHCGT2|5|very good
B00M9GOYR8|5|the shirt fits perfect good quality top notch like most things from Harley Davidson I love the shirt
B00LH58HBG|1|Absolutely cheap material. When stretched, it gets a blotchy see-through appearance. I ordered three of these & the total package weight was only 2 pounds including the packaging - which says something. Barely come to the knee & have a thin elastic band at the top, not the wide elastic shown.
B005GVJJLO|1|not a womans hat, too small. this is a childs size and i will not give it a star at all.  0 star
B00A3SJQ3Q|4|this scarf didnt last that long, but it was nice while it did
B00KUI2STI|4|keep in mind that this is supposed to be a form fitting party dress, it runs a little small had I seen notes to this effect I would have ordered the next size up. If fits I can wear it but it is just enough too tight that I am not sure how well it will hold up. Dress looks great and I would definitely recommend with the understanding that it does run a little small.
B00LZ0HVMO|4|The craftsmanship of this dress surprisingly decent, considering the price. I ordered the burgundy in XL. I'm 5'11 and normally wear 14/16. This dress is extremely form fitting and doesn't provide much stretch. If you're on the taller side, this dress is almost knee length. Aside, from the length I really like the way this dress accentuates my curves.
B00O13PU70|5|Holy moly these are are warm! So thick and snug on my hands. And I didn't even know they were smartphone compatible when I bought them, a feature which works perfectly, score!
B003ICB7C2|5|I bought this costume for me and cookie monster for my 5 year old and daddy was oscar the grouch.we did the whole elmo theme and loved it. We bought sweat pants to wear with costume and were warm.
B005A20XUK|5|These are so comfortable. They do run a bit large and they are my favorite jeans.
B00AGHAVM4|5|I love this top.  It's lightweight, fashionable, flattering and very comfortable.  I'm 5'7\\" with a slim build, not super muscular but not flabby and I ordered a small.  I've gone on two 5 mile runs with a short sleeve base under this top and have been warm and comfortable in low-mid 60's weather with mild gusts.  And, it doesn't smell yet when dry.    If you plan to wear this top for casual wear, I'd order up a size.  The top is designed with movement in mind and is therefore made to be sung, especially in the forearms.    Really can't beat this, especially for the price.  I'm watching the other colors for great prices so I can get more.    Delivery was on time and well wrapped.
B007YZOI3Y|5|Finally, a bra that is nice to look at and feels good to wear. It offers nice shaping support yet feels invisible.
B00HHUFC4K|5|These pj's are soooo comfortably soft.  I love them.  This is the second pair of Disney Lux jammies I've bought.  I was initially nervous about the fit (I'm a healthy pizza loving girl) but they're perfect.  The details are unbelievably cute.  Recommend...
B00EZOBAIS|4|Not exactly every day wear, but they made my Halloween costume work and will last a few more times.
B00G4CSK8C|5|This was a gift & my brother loved it!  The robe feels very soft & luxurious & is great to put on after a bath or shower.  I would recommend it to anyone!
B00IM575C6|5|Love these jeans.  Very satisfied.
B00DZQHS74|3|It's a perfectly acceptable, inexpensive bowtie. No, it's not the same quality as the more expensive ones (the fabrics shinier, wrinkles easily and slips) but for the price, it totally gets the job done!
B00DX6WOE8|4|The material is thin so it makes a great summer tee shirt. Though someone looking for a sturdier feeling shirt may be disappointed. Something to note is that I'm a solid medium but it fit me a bit loose around the waist. Overall a pretty good shirt.
B00M4K29Y4|2|first one was too small and this one was too big im 5&#34; 165 pounds, figure it out...
B00F8IJ7N0|5|Love this. Bought for the pun, stayed for the lulz. My friends love it. I think it's light and breezy for my bojangles on a hot day. Would buy 100 more.
B005H1ZHLE|3|shoulders are a bit large... cover up will take care of it...<br />waist down fits fine
B004JYJJL4|2|The costume was very cute (nice fabric, perfect princess costume), but arrived with several orange stains on it.  The stains are large & visible enough that I can't even get away with wearing the costume at a nighttime party.  Very bummed, because otherwise this would have been a nice catch.
B005FHXMV2|1|Nothing more than a cheap Halloween wig. It doesn't even have elastic in it to keep it on your head! It's also complete straight, nothing like the photo. Don't waste your money.
B002YW71TA|4|We purchased this as a Christmas gift for a friend. She absolutely loved it! The shirt is made of good material, has nice color, and is adorable. We did not wash it, so I do not know how it holds up!
B00M0QYO1S|5|Hard to find sizes in department stores. Good quality. Glad we tried Amazon.
B0014K7EFE|5|GAVE THIS TO MY BF FOR XMAS.  HE LUVS IT.  HE WORE IT TO A FOOTBALL GAME AND RECEIVE ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS.
B00K824ZBA|1|2 of the 6 shirts I ordered had holes in them.
B00NOAUFIU|5|It's great!! My niece loves it!!
B00BCUP9SK|4|the size is too large. Need give size information details.
B007PSE3DA|5|Bought for my wife for xmas. She loves them. Good quality, good fit and very comfortable to wear in bed.
B00MFKXA7S|5|Darling!
B00I0IURRU|5|I'm a 5'9&#34; guy  with fairly average build.  I do not where fitted shirts so I ordered the XXL(US L) size of this item.  It fits perfect.  A little slimmer fit than a normal dress shirt, but not tight.  The material seems nice, a little stretchy, but not enough to look like the shirt is stretching to fasten the buttons.  I would definitely order again.
B008HS00M0|5|I really love it !!! I purchased this at 6 months pregnant in a medium weighing 150 and it was perfect. It's light weight and really works perfectly with a dress. I wish I would have have bought more in different colors but the nude goes with everything :)
B00PTXFMGA|2|Fits small and is scratchy on sensitive skin :(
B00F4YC0I2|5|Fits great and is very comfortable, but isn't the warmest.
B00A1Z9EB0|5|The tshirts are a hit at my house. Both of my sons love the graphics and colors. Bought more because they continued to wear the same one over and over.
B00L3XPOJK|5|I am plane to buy this shirt to wear to work only. but when I receive a shirt . I am very shock.  this shirt looking so good and fit me so perfect. I hope the seller have more this color and size. I will order more.
B00P608PD8|4|Good
B00DEH7BZS|5|Very good size and quality
B00N1LST3K|5|Love, love, love PattyBoutik.  They make great quality clothing, and the sleeves and shirt length are always long enough for me (I have a longer torso, and can never be sure when I order shirts online where they will hit on my waist).  This shirt/sweater is a little thin, but not to the point where it is see through; I really love it and it is now one of my favorite new sweaters.<br />All and all great quality and fit.  I got a large and it fit just like you expect a large to fit.
B004DREO9Y|5|Most comfortable pjs I ever worn,
B005FOCNKQ|5|I looked high and low and finally settled on these sweaters for my crew.  The men look sporty in them, they like the fit and warmth.  Doesn't look so much like a &#34;hoodie&#34;.  Separates my crew from the pack.  Easy upgrade for the business.
B002QQ7TFU|5|A gift for my sister.  She said it was perfect!
B00ACIFQGS|5|The six pack of Hanes t-shirts are what I need and Amazon has them. It's great to have bright white t-shirts again. The Hanes name is one to depend on in terms of quality clothing.  I highly recommend the Hanes brand.
B00G9YU1B4|5|My daughter lives it and it fits perfect!
B006MXXCHC|5|I love it. It's the perfect size. If you work in a place that requires a clear bag... This is a great fit!
B009Z3NIF2|4|I'm 5'10&#34; - and these are VERY small - so my butt kinda hangs out the back. Not bad for me - but for the taller buyer - take it into consideration. Also - the white is VERY see through all through the crotch. Again, not unworkable, but slightly annoying. I use these for my pole fitness classes and they work really well for it.
B00C0PF1IY|1|Too small. Returned
B00CH7MF7K|5|Beautiful dress for a slim person. This dress is an aye catcher! A lot of people been curious to where i got this vintage dress.The dress fits exactly how it looks on amazon. The colour is like teal..,..lovely colour. it is a sweet simple vintage classic dress. I bought a medium as i weigh 130lbs at a height of 5&#34;5&#34; bust 34b and waist is 33 inches.
B000L6IDI4|5|I love this coat the cut and styling are perfect it will keep you bone dry in the wettest weather, Get the hood for full effect..  This coats only possible shortcoming are the snaps they could be a bit more aggressive, still I love this coat so Five stars.
B00MQALN8U|5|I love this shirt! The first day I went out in public with it on I was given a compliment. The fabric is light and so soft! For anyone that needs help with measurements I ordered a large and I'm 5'5, 170 lbs and I wear a size 36 C to D depending on the bra. I'm currently 3 months pregnant and was looking for the perfect shirt that gave me room, but still looked cute and didn't make me look like a whale and thankfully I nailed it on the first try with this one. I've only washed it once and hung it to dry and everything still looks good, but for the price I'll sew it myself if needed. I'm about to order the same shirt in Ivory and can't wait to order it in red once they have a large available!
B0018OHHA8|5|Size 40 by 29 relax fit is hard to find in all colors, but the color offered was great
B001NS9GJO|5|the pants is great, the cut, the color, the preparation everything is great, the only thing I was wrong to buy far, not so good medi my husband'm huge, very big, I have to fix a designer or satre so that it reaches the desired size, but I bought another of the same so you can use it, because the pants are divine, spectacular cut
B00DYCO7UU|5|The jeans are built well, however, for me, they aren't cut as great as they look. They are sort of boxy, but are a little flattering.
B00ZHDHYK4|5|[[VIDEOID:f463581354a608b01d6f635d468327fb]]Update: I spoke with the seller of this gorgeous piece and based on the reviews saying that it ran small they have updated the size chart based on customer input. The size chart should be fairly accurate now. :-)<br /><br />This is gorgeous but I agree with a couple other reviews that it does run small. I got the 2X and I would say at most it would fit a 14-16 where here a 2X would fit an 18-20. I can still get it around me in the waist but not the hips. However, it is so pretty that maybe this is some more motivation to lose the winter weight I gained. :-)<br /><br />The silk is soft and shiny and the pattern is lovely. At most when laying flat the width is 26\\" across the back and that is being generous, the length is 34\\" and the sleeves at the widest point are 11.5\\"H.<br /><br />There are matching fabric loops to hold the matching tie on. The stitching is nicely done and overall it a beautiful piece, just make sure you order a couple of sizes up. :-)<br /><br />I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.
B00DVKQX6G|4|Colour and pattern are very nice but there is no sewing quality at all. But I could expect that already so it wasn't a surprise. Appearance was more important this time.
B00KCCVB4U|2|was way too small even though it says it fits . :(
B00H3WE0MC|5|Comfy, good color, lots of compliments....lots of style. this was one of my best purchases, would highly recommend o any one looking for a chemo cap.
B00LTMDR3K|5|Got this as a gift and it fit nicely on him!
B00O9DXD6W|2|Quality is horrible. 18 bucks for five ties it's what you get, save yourself and buy one or two acceptable ties.
B003U1LEM4|5|I wore these for my daughter's pirate birthday party.<br /><br />They were not to big and perfect.  I am about 119 lbs and 5'3\\".
B00LKW2RNK|5|Bought to go with my suit. will look wonderful on its own or with a sweater. Wish they had a larger size. I Bought the largest possible.<br />would recommend to friends and family.<br />I bought a xxl and wear a size usa/12
B00FXIWNRM|1|I purchased the blue and black of the LQ high waisted midi skirts. They're described as faux leather. It just looks like cheapness & doesn't resemble leather in the slightest. I didn't even try them on because they don't look as described. Waisted purchase. Will return immediately!!!!
B00BMEUL4S|3|Only one of the shirts was printed correctly on the front. Was supposed to say &#34;American Gangster&#34; but said &#34;Medium Rare&#34;
B0006NMCCA|3|i didn't think it would be THIS BRIGHT! nice style though, don't get this color!
B00X4PHT0C|5|Very cute, we had to cut it though, to make it more like Joy from the movie.
B00ZGDA54W|5|Perfect, order came in earlier than expected! Of course it's a polo so you get a size bigger. I LOVE it!
B00BBQBDB2|2|I am a large woman and like a loose sweatshirt and have some of the Gildans from years back when made in the USA and they are wonderful. Bought 3 in Dec. 2013 for a great price and all 3 colors of the same size as my old ones are made in Honduras and are short and tight. They were a great price so I am thinking they are seconds that were not made right. I am so so disappointed as the old ones were longer than all the other brands I looked at so tried to get the same brand. Why can't anyone leave things alone that are not broken. Charge me $5.00 more for extra material. I would be sure of their sizing before purchase.
B005ISU3BK|2|Can't wear this touching your skin. It also gets horizontal wrinkle at waist line when you sit down as it has no curve for the difference between the waist circumference and the hips.
B003AU5WG4|5|Fit was very good. Item delivered as represented. Quality of shirt very good.
B001AERR56|5|Kidding, kinda, not really. I love this hat. The material feels light but durable. You can ball the whole hat up and it will pop right back to shape. I have yet to test the claims of how water repellent it is but i have a feeling it will be fine, the hats pretty rugged. It does come with a silly button on the side but thats very easy to remove. Just turn the front half and the back half of the pin bends so you can take it off.
B00G9795HW|5|Used for a Halloween outfit and it worked! It wasn't fitted in that it hugged your body, it had some slack, which is what I wanted.
B00062NOT6|4|Ordered it to replace a jacket that was taken from me and it seems to be a little lighter weight than the one I had, but seems nice.  It's comfortable and fits well.
B00BRV2G2Q|1|i ordered this hat and never came, watch out for this scammers! so much for my christmas gift :(, dont buy from them, dont waist your time
B00H4SJCNM|5|It was nice
B00EZO9L6Q|4|Shipped quickly.  I need it to complete an outfit.  It is a bit snug, but it will do.
B00N9I50Y6|5|Very nice headband.  My daughter loves it.  Highly recommend!!
B00DGWRM8C|4|It was great
B003FWGIWO|5|The product was perfect, just as expected, and even included a handwritten thank you note.  Definitely would by something again from this company.
B00D7UB1BM|2|Was not true to size at all no where near. Ordered a large my daughter who is a size 2 is wearing it.
B000I1G1L8|5|The perfect mixture between a regular bra and nursing bra. Lifts you up so you look nice, but with the snap of a clasp, you're ready to nurse. I LOVE THIS ONE.
B00AZ6QTOU|3|Very lightweight and comfortable.  I wouldn't venture out of the house with them on though.
B002HJ3G0S|5|I have looked for these for over a year. These are absolutely the best I have ever owned. I got 3 pair, opened only 1....and hid the other ones back. I hand wash after wearing and they dry quickly
B001I45Y08|2|The gloves are very warm, but they are very tough to get your fingers into, especially when its freezing cold and you are just trying to get your gloves on as fast as possible.  Typically for me a size XL glove is more than big enough to fit my hand without any issue, but it takes me quite a bit of fidgeting to get my fingers into the finger stalls on these gloves.
B00CTU4UO6|1|Too small
B00A9HLI50|5|nice fabric, good quality, fast service
B004TERIQ2|5|Great bed jacket for our Mom!
B00LOA81QU|4|Ordered a size larger, so the fit was fine. Just need to order the shoes to match.
B008BF6M44|5|Great pants not too heavy not too light.
B00AO5KLWS|5|Very nice slack
B0087KH968|5|Respect ✔️💯👌
B00L4FC328|2|Got it for my girlfriend, who normally likes smaller cut bikinis.  She's 5'4&#34; 120lbs.  This has a lot of coverage for a small.  But for the price, I guess you cant complain.  Shipped quickly and had no issues.
B00ITL58G8|4|Super cute!  There was a smell to the garment, sort of like a musty basement.  I washed it (as I would any article of new clothing) and the smell is gone.  I took off a star for the smell, but other than that, it's pretty great.
B00TXN7ZFS|3|Fit is fine, Fabric OK and the construction is adequate for the price.  It took me a half hour to trim all of the hanging threads off of it and the cheep pocket fabric shows in the front pockets.
B00EMG3WHQ|5|The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I'm already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.
B00ERPNN80|5|Perfect length for coving fat arms also very soft.
B007QSR354|1|We bought 3 pair, one of these and two pair for my husband. On the plus side, yes, great design. However, all three pair are torn or worn within 10 times of wearing. And i'm beeing serious here. Shame that a company dares to sell such garbage at these prices
B00CUM0J0C|4|It's nothing extravagant, but that's good in my opinion. It's a basic short sleeved polo shirt, perfect for work. It fits well and is comfy and it looks nice. Plus, it's well-priced, so I'm quite satisfied. Also, unlike some of my other clothing purchases through Amazon, this shirt feels like it'll last awhile. Too many times I've purchased shirts online, only to realize they are tissue thin pieces of crap that will fade, tear, and fall apart before the year is out. With this shirt, I don't get that impression.
B00L4HH2BS|5|Love it, love it, love it. This hat is REALLY cute!!
B004NPCFC4|5|Fun Tshirts. Ship on time.
B005MFF7CE|4|I get a lot of compliments with this blouse. I didn't notice it was dry clean only though . . .
B00E1ZLA22|1|This shirt  in my hand less than 2 months,only 4 times washing.I found a hole on the left sleeve. A 5cm suture release.
B00BWJ2TR0|2|I read many reviews about this product before purchasing, specifically to see if they rolled or bunched at the waist.  I don't have much fat in my tummy area, just a little when I am seated - yet the waistband on these is so flimsy, it bunched and dug in all day and I can't wear them anymore.  They do give a good overall shape, but most shape wear will do that.  The Bali shape wear I purchased is much better and I found it only rolled after a year of use and many washes.  A disappointment.
B00B58U6KU|4|Will buy more
B003UYTSZG|3|My son wanted Santa to bring dinosaur big boy underwear for Christmas. These briefs served that purpose, but they are already coming apart at the waistband. :/  Considering they were $12 for 3 pairs of underwear - I wasn't too thrilled. These were just opened on Christmas day 2012 and we're not even through January 2013 yet! Kinda bummed.
B00EUHA46O|5|This is a very handsome belt and works and looks great. I plan to buy other colors in the future.
B00VWFUCDM|4|Absolutely adorable, love the retro style. Looking forward to wearing it to the beach!
B00DOZM3W6|5|a perfect fit for me !
B007RXST6U|5|This jacket is sized correctly and is a comfortable cut. The Italian lamb leather smells great. Love the strong look it creates.
B00PKFF7QW|5|Cute
B00ODU6KQG|5|These pants fit very comfortable and wear well.
B0020MMDXS|5|I love, love, love, this product.  I started wearing it the moment I got it.  The feel/fit/color (beige/nude)  is fantastic!  Oh, and what a difference it makes!!!! Things are now back in place :}<br /><br />My order arrived promptly and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the product-material/structure/color. The cotton lining/everything about it is very well done. I am happy to have read reviews of other products before selecting this one.  This is a keeper!  My only regreat is that I did  not order a black one too (my next purchase).<br /><br />Good Luck,
B00Q5TH5XA|4|The shirt was not sized as indicated too small.. Cute was too small for size indicated.
B00CI1YETM|5|excelente
B00NOFLB7Y|4|cute but a little big on me I ordered a large because of reviews and I usually wear an xs-s
B00MW7TRQ2|5|great graphics but way to big. had to return and order another size.
B004SVOUBW|3|I have little experience with boas, but this one shed so badly I think I could have done as well at the dollar store.  A good boa I imagine would not fall apart with every step.  Since we do many costume parties I had hoped for something I could use more than a few times.  This won't be comfortable or durable
B004GXA9AS|5|I looked and looked for a good match for me and this bra fits great and I get all the support I need. I am glad I found it. The material is of a very good quality. I am very happy.
B000ZYSGAC|5|My boyfriend's entranced with me when I wear this top. I say GO FOR IT! Ps, no thong included. Still worth it. :)
B00NL12LZC|5|Would order again. Perfect fit. Nice quality.
B008P7SR46|5|It is a well made hat.  I had purchased one earlier for the Star Trek Enterprise.  Both hats are very well made.
B005GYGEXC|5|It works great!
B00CL0HPUK|5|Love this scarf. It came in the time frame that was given. The color looks the same as the picture, which is a good thing, it's a pretty light pink color. I love wearing it. Little short when you double it but not bad at all. I recommend this scarf.
B00IFF9HV0|5|My daughter wears it when she has gymnastics and always gets nice comments ! And its pink!
B00C3TY020|3|I asked that it be in earlier than the date set and had to change my address. Both were taken care of. The top was just a little large and the stars in my opinion are on the wrong side.
B005DIMV7O|5|I like it very much.  It was a gift for my husband.  However I need to return this one and get a larger size.  I think I need a 4X usually a 2X fits him the sizing is completely off compared to what he usually wears.
B00SMGLBSO|5|I should have gotten a large instead of an xlnt. The material is great and the color is perfect.
B00CHW8ZOC|1|Fits more like a 2x ordered 3 sizes bigger so i could wear over swimsuit
B007RF91YW|5|This was a great gift for Pokemon lovers<br />price and shipping were great even during the holiday season<br />would order again if I needed more
B00LTEOY30|3|I would have like the sizing to be more US-attuned, though the garment is fine for the price, it is not what I expected for the extra shipping cost and ill size comparison. There should be an honest size comparison.  I am a size 12 at most, US, and this conversion could use some serious work.  It is essential that women like me be able to take advantage of the right prices, quality, and beauty at the right advertised price for the same.universal size on line.
B006SVWDZK|4|ADORABLE!!!  But either runs very true to size or a bit small.  My daughter is in the 97% percentile for size for her age so they were a bit snug around her thighs.
B00MZCW6Y4|4|Everything worked out well
B00519BD0G|5|Most extenders may be a little longer but this one is so comfortable you don't know it is there.  It is very well made and superior to the others I have used.
B00DDQWZBA|5|My lady was very happy
B007H5N6V6|5|It fit great to my little girl. Good material and confortable. She looks pretty beautiful! I'm very satisfied. Also it arrives on time.
B00O3D165S|4|Loved them!
B003D85C0O|3|I wear an 8.5 so i opted to buy the large thinking that a little room would be great...well they where huge they fit more like a 9.5-10 so they where accurate as far as that goes...They do not have glitter on the heel that was sad and are not comfortable however they are very sequinny and where a hit as decoration...
B00J2V5ON6|3|I love the comfy fit of these jeans! But...when they arrived they smelled like mothballs! And after many failed attempts they still do!!!
B007L85M20|5|I loved it, looks great, really shiny and it's exactly how it looks in the photo. It comes with 2 necklaces and 2 nice bags for each one. I l'll definitely get one of those again.
B003YJE75I|5|This socks fit well and feel well. I just don't understand why they are called no-show socks when they show
B00LNH35S8|4|Liked it
B00P4C045K|5|Absolutely wonderful
B00NB4MJ1A|5|Gave it 5 stars b/c it fits as expected and is so comfortable even after washing.
B00CHJJ0SA|5|Excellent!
B00MU7EF5M|4|Beautiful item, but the woman's large fits like an extra small/small
B00KWGANMC|1|fits way too small
B00K7V6254|5|its very cute and comfortable. The material is nice.
B00CJQHW54|3|I am not a tall person and this was short on me. I am 5'2&#34; and I weigh 105 pounds and a small fits but it is very tight everywhere but the waist. I have to buy a slip to go under it to hopefully add some length so I can wear it in public. Other than that, very cute, but I don't think I'll be able to wear it more than once without it ripping, the fabric is very cheap.
B0026DW0AW|5|I am 5'4, 230 and it fits. it doesn't snug at all.
B00MJLC5Y2|5|This belt did what I bought it for: held up a pair of jeans that wanted to fall down, without being too obtrusive.
B007T27LT0|4|Nice shorts, I like the fact that they have a liner.
B006LHMVW6|5|I really like these briefs. I bought them to wear when I workout, but I find myself wearing them everywhere. The driefs don't ride up & they stay cool & quick drying. I just bought 4 more pair. I'm officially done with the 100% cotton briefs!
B005CSOO3Y|5|These shorts fit exactly as advertized. Great for the gym, court, hanging out, or lounging.
B00AEYXPNQ|5|This shirt is really cool.  I was worried about the quality and fit, but i have worn this shirt at a normal rate for the last 3 months and the quality and fit are excellent.  As good as any other shirt i own.  The image has not shown any signs of wear yet.  It has been washed and dried many times in the last 3 months.
B00I0695WA|3|It's a nice dress just poorly made and horrible material used .. But u get what u pay for .. It would be hard to alter because seems are on the cut out parts
B00BSPNEHC|5|Love it
B00RMX1BMO|5|Very good fit. I look amazing in it. Now I'm going to order me another color.  I wish it came in white
B0036UTCP0|5|10 STARS**********  Honestly!!!  This brown herringbone, absolutely well-fitting hat (for my small noggin) is just totally outstanding!!! I hesitate to buy anything in the way of clothing, except large T-shirts, online because of sizing differences among manufacturers.  I know that I take a 6-3/4 in a hat, and I took a chance that this hat would run true, and it did.  It's lightweight, very Irish (as am I, mostly), fits me beautifully and I looove it!  I really don't want to take it off, and I've gotten quite a few compliments on it in only a couple of days.  My husband pointed out that it's similar to the one that Sean Connery wore as James Malone in the 1987 \\"The Untouchables\\" movie.  I hadn't realized that.  And I looove Sean Connery!!!  Of course, it's also similar to the one worn by John Wayne in the movie \\"The Quiet Man.\\"  And, to top it all off, it arrived from Victory Hat Shop in only a few days.  I highly recommend this hat for its style and quality.  If you measure your head correctly, and order according to the sizing chart that is provided, you should be happy with ordering the corresponding size.  Order and ENJOY!!!
B005JT3EZA|3|Really great quality, nice and soft, but sizing was very small. Will keep it, because it really is a beautiful shirt.
B007W0XRK6|3|too tight around the upper thigh
B0018719GS|5|They fit well, are easy for her to get on, she loves that they are dinos, and wants to wear them all the time, rain or shine.  And they seem comfy to walk in.  No parts have come off, though the paint on the face does get a bit scuffed
B005GWGBG4|3|The design itself is awesome but the construction is horrible. The straps in the front never stay in place and if you put a water bottle on the side or something it wiggles like crazy so its practically useless. Also if you have planning on carrying any textbooks in here, forget it! well, may be one, a notebook and a paperback but that's probably it.
B0054IZP4E|2|Just a paper mask. It doesn't have any relieve, nor texture. It should be sold cheaper. I mean no offense.
B00E8I9MAE|5|love the way these feel.  i am repeating what I said above  so I will just fill this in- keep up the good products
B00LD6FJHO|5|This dress looked great! I will be buying in other colors. At first I didn't think it would arrive on time, but it did!
B00DQEPBKQ|5|Perfect for summer! What drew me in was the price! Unbelievably low.  It compares to similar dresses from Horney Toad and Columbia which are almost 3x as much.  I have the charcoal (which looks more green) purple, and just ordered the green.  I've worn the dresses with tights, boots, and sweater on cooler days, so I am guessing that this dress will transition well into fall/winter. The fabric is high quality, not too thin and doesn't wrinkle easily.  I gained a lot of weight this year so I was grateful to fit into the extra-large and the dress is flattering and makes me feel good!
B007PSEFXS|3|I loved this shirt, the fit and quality.  I returned it because the color was not uniform.  This occurred two times so I placed an order for a different color and this one was fine.
B00W2U2RU2|4|Amazing seller (IGO), great communication, excellent Customer service. A+++. Dress was beautiful & as pictured, unfortunately it ran slightly smaller than stated on the website and needed to be returned. Return process was satisfactory & Seller provided 100% refund including return shipping costs. Pleasure to do business with. Definitely recommended.&#34;
B00RDQR4H6|5|Mmmmmm
B000I8YBL8|5|Product was not received on time due to a problem w/the U.S. post office and a new home address. Shipper was very understanding and helpful about resending the product which was then received exactly as promised.  Highly recommend this company/shipper -- they were extremely helpful even though the problem occured during the busy Christmas season.
B00HFDC2QA|5|It's perfect. It fit good.
B006IC0LFI|4|I bought it for one ski occasion. and it work very well, waterproof,air-permeable. and most importantly, it is warm enough when you just wearing this pants.
B002LFNJ64|4|The shirt is made well. Should last through a few wears and washing's.Being a former Marine,I enjoy the bold USMC lettering and it does the trick for me in the summer time heat.Semper FI.
B00E1PW2J2|4|cheaply made, but still great for a Fairy Odd Parents costume.
B003WLBJF4|3|I took a new job at warehouse for seasonal employment; Trouble is that it's not climate controlled. Being that I hate the feeling of cold on the lower back where the shirt and pants tend to separate, I figured that a union suit would be perfect. To say the least, this item is not holding up very well. The button off the back of the suit snapped off the second time I pulled on a pair of pants. The sleeve elastic has already worn out to the point where I am considering cutting them off and making this short-sleeved. The leg elastic has gone the same way as the sleeves which means that they didn't spend any kind of time ensuring the overall quality of this item. Considering the purpose of this item and how well it's holding up, I am not optimistic about it lasting through the winter without alterations on my part, and that's not what I was looking for when I purchased it. The fabric is thinner than I would imagine a thermal suit being and doesn't posses very much wicking ability. There's nothing like the dampness of sweat and the stink that follows when you remove this item to make you think twice about having purchased it. Plain cotton undershirts, doubled up (and under a sweatshirt or sweater), have never soaked up as much sweat, grime, and odor and I was wearing this item as my only undershirt with a sweatshirt over the top and pants over the bottom.<br /><br />Another thing to consider is the front of the shirt where the buttons are located. This item would be better suited with some overlap of material under the buttons to keep gaps from appearing because they are spaced too far apart. The buttons are, also, smaller that I would like and have the annoying tendency to come loose in odd places (instead of in a cluster which would, at the very least, suggest a sizing issue to give me something other than the quality of the item to blame).<br /><br />So far, the item is doing nothing more/nothing less than what it was intended for. The downside is that I have lost confidence that it will be doing that for very much longer and its' quality is such that I will not consider purchasing another one when this wears out. Point of reference, I received this item on December 14th and am writing this review on January 9th.fidence that it will be doing that for very much longer and its' quality is such that I will not consider purchasing another one when this wears out. Point of reference, I received this item on December 14th and am writing this review on January 9th.
B001CH2E54|1|I did not like the cigarette case.  It was advertised that it would hold 100's, but I have to smash the pack down into the case to close it.  I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it, so it just sits there. I would not recommend this case for people who smoke 100's.
B0034ZC4FW|4|good
B00CKLI8Y2|3|it's thick medium quality cotton, too hot in summer, too cool in fall. and by the way: did the ad say this?  the back is buttoned top to bottom.  a cute style, but i didn't expect it.
B00CV0PCCI|5|I tried on this jacket at JCPenney before buying here, and knew it was the right size before buying. I will say that of you are usually between two sizes, go to the larger one.
B00H7H8HCC|1|We ordered my sons usual size. This brand's sizing was way too large in body and in sleeve length. In process of returning it.
B002EVPSX2|5|as expected very good
B00NXNROSW|5|Great product
B007N1CE8A|4|The dress looks great and feels great. It's made out of suede material so for a cold halloween you should be warm.    I'm quite short, 5'0\\" and my wait is a 25 I guess, in women jeans and the dress comes right above my knees. Also its loose and not as fitting as i expected it to be. I purchased a small and an extra small would've been perfect but that size doesn't exist. I got it tailored and now it fits great.    This is a great halloween costume, and I'm going to wear it with these flats and have my hair in a braid and wearit with the provided head band.
B00BZDURXG|4|The pants are cute, but it's too big at the hips and too tight in the legs.
B001E7LHBY|5|These pants are great!! I had the kaki's and liked the fit so much that I ordered these.  They look great on!  I have a pear shape so while my tush and thighs are kinda on the big side, my waist is smaller.  These fit me perfect.  I hate pants that gap in the back, and these don't at all.  They are so comfy with the comfort waist fit and just look fabulous and are very slimming.  Because these are the jean looking version of this pant I can wear them with a sweatshirt or whatever, or I can dress them up with heels and a cute top for a very flattering look.  I think I'm going to buy these pants in other colors!!!!
B00EVKP3NE|5|I love this T shirt. it is somewhat small, and if i put weight on it would not look right. i would say this shirt fits a trim, athletic person best. A stouter man may consider a size up.
B008MA3JYY|4|I like the lightness of the fabric, though there is no actual tummy or thigh support, the fabric is on the silky side and allows for better lines.
B00FGNAAJC|1|Too large.
B00B70IC6G|5|Beautiful scarf for the price. Nice length and texture.  I can see myself wearing this scarf to work and the beach!
B00GXT5FP2|5|This is a nice, comfy bra. Doesn't bind, has quite good support and, the straps being adjustable to wear with other backs/necklines could be a nice feature. Attractive, easy, good for summer wear (not hot/binding) -- I like it and have re-ordered, so speaks well.
B00DYO5XA6|5|Just what I expected - a multi layered detachable coat
B001E0HNFK|5|the best choice!
B00FJ8TPE0|4|good material, very warm and lightweight for the warmth. The zipper is not great. it is a &#34;YKK&#34; but is not fluid or smooth like it should be
B000W5OTSW|3|The quality of the costume is great, the shipping of it amazing , everything was perfect until I see the size of the costume. I know I had order this costume 6-9 months, it fits my daughter huge . She's only 6 months & the costume is 12 M. I mean, if it wasn't for the fitting . I would had love this so much , but sadly it wasn't like that.
B00LU2G4CU|5|Terrific robe. High quality flannel, well constructed. Just what I was looking for. I'm 5' 10&#34; on a good day, and the S/M size is perfect. The &#34;black-brown tone&#34; color description is funny. It's black & mauve, with a thin blue stripe, nothing brown about it. That said, it looks great, feels nice.
B00MKMSZNA|4|Cute.
B004S08HG2|3|These are way too light for winter. They have small mesh holes that the wind will go right through. Definitely a spring or summer pant.
B00KV85UXI|4|If you have a larger chest this will not hang like a night gown. I love this night gown for being so feminine but it s***s in my collar bone to have room for my chest.
B00FEPB8GQ|5|It came quickly and in perfect condition, I definitely recommend it to friends, family, cosplayers, and whomever is looking for a great light blue skirt..
B00CTUWEO4|2|Good product but terrible for working out
B004M22DIO|5|light and durable fabric, great for hot summer weather.  reminiscent of dickies workwear but with a little spandex for a modern technology fiber that stretches and allows for comfortable movement.  great for skateboarding, riding a bike or sitting around having a brewski!!!
B00ELRPMYW|3|The fabric is great. However, it is cut too small. I bought a large and it is more like a medium. the fabric is very clingy and has no stretch.
B00AJLJZQ0|5|Great cargo shorts.  Very pleased with them.
B00KHYGIN2|5|I bought this for my wife as a present, not only does she love it but it looks great as well.
B006ZTP6YA|5|Very nice product
B00MTWRZD2|5|My granddaughter loved it! So cute.
B00KH8M2VU|5|Regardless of the material, we both love it. My daughter saw it online and asked for it and I purchased it before I even read the reviews. I am actually glad I didn't read them first. She absolutely loves it and it fits her perfectly. She was looking at herself in the mirror wearing it and holding little Pepa pigs hands. SO cute! Great buy!
B00J0F0GQO|5|I normally wear a 26 in most brand name jeans. These were huge in 26 so I returned for the 25's. Fit perfect but stretched out just a bit after one day wear.
B006YET35O|1|This shirt is made of some kind of material that makes it feel like you are wearing heavy plastic in the gym. Not a nice feeling. It also fits oddly for a fitted shirt with very little \\"fit\\" going on. Threw it in my gym bag when it first arrived so had to wear it once but will never wear again.
B00I6CR2LY|5|Bought it to be roomy, and it was.  Great, heavy-duty material, but very comfortable and soft, not rough on the skin. Length is good, both front and back, doesn't ride up and leave my belly hanging out.  I'll be buying more of these.
B00H3YUOP2|5|My teen age daugter loved these pants.  The fit perfectly.
B00OC6XYM4|4|Definitely need to get one size up for perfect fit. Very comfortable and funky with the pockets. Really like it for the price!
B0027BFDMA|5|they fit great and lasts me for years...quality through and through from their jackets to their jeans....will always recommend to others
B000Q7B6Z0|4|I am very happy with this product! It definitely exceeded my expectations! It is a perfect fit and the order came before it was due!
B00RK367Z2|5|good quality.
B00HQ956OI|5|So adorable
B00IS36YDS|3|More cheaply made than I expected.  Somewhat thin fabric top is see through.<br />Looks much nicer in picture.
B00689BASS|4|This belt is very well-built, and demonstrates the excellent, tried-and-trusted quality of Allen Edmonds. I love the brogue details and the two-tone leather. Though it looks absolutely smashing, I am still left in remorse about paying US$100 for a belt (and I even got a discount through an Amazon coupon). I wish something this stylish and high quality were available just a bit more affordably--I'd even feel better about paying $80 for a belt, as I recently did for a reversible brown/orange Cole Haan. In all, Allen Edmonds products are the best in the business, but I am only giving this 4 and not 5 stars because it is so freaking pricey.<br /><br />Finally, just a side note that some other reviewers have been right in suggesting that this belt runs a little on the smaller side. So if you are a 32, definitely order the belt in a 34, etc., as per the belt-sizing standard... Unless you are pretty skinny like me, ordering at your pant size is going to result in a slightly shrink-wrapped belt. Enjoy!
B00CBQ7OXC|3|I'm glad they make big guy sizes<br />I'm not sure  how I feel about the end of the sleeves. It's twice the normal size wrist cuff for no obvious reason.<br />Nice color.
B00BXLPJ92|5|Perfect fit, nice & warm!
B00KGE7COW|5|I love these jeans! Waist is a little looser than I would have wanted, but that's oak for me. You might want to size down.
B006ZH83RE|4|I feel like I came from a flat butt to a bubble butt lol its crazy all my friends use to say I never had a butt but now their speechless and still haven't told them it wasn't mine well it is I defiantly paid for it.
B00HK1ZBJC|4|Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Material is a little rougher than expected but after a wash with some softener no undershirt needed. I was hoping for a small Mexico flag above the text (similar to what other countries have for the same design) but a small detail I'm willing to forgive to show my team's pride!<br /><br />Worth the purchase, might get the USA one next :)
B008CIS6N0|5|I order my now 3 year son these jeans last year and he still have them to this day and they still in perfect shape. the jean fit perfect and they a good jean
B00ZJNAEYA|3|Runs small.  And if you return, be prepared to pay for return shipping.  I will keep it and gift it to someone who can fit into it.
B00KPP6FHC|5|Perfect fit. Love Tom's Ware dresses.<br />Liz M.
B004IAIK9Q|4|They gave a little push up. I would have likes if they sat in my bra better. But overall they did what I needed them to do.
B00NOFLB5G|1|Ugly ugly shirt...
B0019NJLYS|4|I bought this for my fiance when the &#34;sexy olive oil&#34; costume refused to ship in a timely manner. I am glad we were able to make the change. It was much cheaper and it looked good. I have read some complaints on here about size. We purchased the Small: 2-8. My fiancé is a size 0-2, depending on the store, and it was close to being tight on her. Anyone who is a solid size 4-8, especially 6-8, could have problems with the costume.<br /><br />Otherwise, we are happy with the purchase, and she got compliments on her outfit.
B00896PHXC|5|Bought these to update my drawer full of dilapidated black socks, and I wasn't disappointed. The difference in quality between these and packs running upwards of $10 for 2-3 pairs is negligible.
B00DNSP100|4|Good quailty shirt
B0002VA3CM|5|This shirt is elegance, refinement,and quality all rolled into one. It is sure to win the approval of the most discriminating man. All who see it will know that it belongs to a connoisseur of good taste.
B002XFI8NQ|4|The pants are well made, I've ordered them before. They fit true to size, don't order a size up. You will regret it.
B00NP3VUX0|4|Its a gift for my friend hope she likes it.  Its very nice
B00B2VWE8M|5|Great
B0018OOHLU|5|It is good to still be able to get these in big sizes and at a reasonable price! Can't beat that
B00WLEWIQW|5|Great shirt, really nice quality and fit.
B00GQTQ94U|4|This is a really cute top but looked even cuter in the pictures. I realized quickly that I was never going to get the buttons undone, but, luckily, I can put it on over my head.
B003H26ZYS|5|I got both frog and fire chief rain coats for my boys. Both are lovely, so much cuter in person. Seems to be a good quality, too, will see how long it lasts. It runs little smaller, so if your child is chubby or tall, go one size up. I got size 4/5 and it fits my skinny average height 3 year old perfectly.
B007KF1W3M|5|Great socks.  Perfect fit for my 7 yr old who has huge feet but I expect he will outgrow them before they are worn out.  He goes through socks so fast though I wish I had bought these sooner.  I will buy them again in the next size up when he outgrows them.  They've gone through about a month's worth of washing and aren't stretched out at all.
B00EI4EPR8|4|I was looking for this dress in green, but it was out of stock in all my local shops. Was excited to at last find it in amazon. I am 5'4&#34;, 124-128 lbs, busty. This dress was super fast with prime and came in good shape, material was jersey and ok. Ran a bit long, which I sort of expected as I am not tall and was ready to hem it. The top however gave a very bad fit. The ruched waist sat on mid chest, instead of sitting on the waist. I was expecting to  get a cinched in waist and camouflage the lower abdomen, but instead I get a top balloon like silhouette. I wish I was bold enough to share my images.<br /><br />I returned it, and don't think going a size higher is going to solve the problem. May look good on someone with tall and super skinny  frame.
B00LT79QVC|5|Wash and dryer they fit just fine.
B00540H1LW|5|Ordered  3 of these for my father in law and he loves them!
B00U37WEXG|5|Super cute shirt!!  I'm a 10/12 and the large fit perfect.
B00KJDMZS8|5|Me gustó!!!
B00MY5UEZK|5|Best sock ever they actually keep my feet warm. Very comfortable.
B00GHZ4OUY|3|ok
B0034ZFWJW|5|Love, love, love the pattern and colors together. I was involved in a MVA and got blood all over this a week after I got it. I was so bumbed I just knew the stain would not come out but, to my good fortune it came right out. I didn't even get to wash it until the next day, no stains!!! This is high quality material and it didn't even fade. Love it!!!
B00EWASFQA|5|I love my swimsuit havent worn them yet but i like both of them. i got my items way before they said their will be there.
B003GX7IRQ|1|IT is ugly and does not look at all like picture California Costumes Owes me one that looks Real Not a Rag cap too big cut work not cute at all. Hello California costumes U Owe me one This is UGLY sorry to say sending it back to
B008OTC926|1|I have tried to order this for my girlfriend 3 times now, and every time after a week of not processing - it seems to disappear from my orders list! I buy a lot of products from amazon! This is filled by cafe press - but either way I am very disappointed with just how many times I tried to order this and it was taken off my list for no reason! It was meant to be a meaningful surprise, and instead turned into a long time burdon of waiting for it to send, then long after it should have been sent, it disappeared from my list! Nothing ever arrived, and I did not get billed (so far that I know of any way!). Just disappointed!
B00ACIGRPM|5|Exactly as advertised and expected.  Great value and seems like a quality product.  Will order these again in the future.
B00LMWU5MI|5|Wonderful dress! Very comfortable and flattering. Casual and a little dressy at the same time. There's texture on the black part around the neck that wasn't really visible in the photo, but I love it. Definitely recommend. Amazon has it cheaper than other retailers.
B00YNXR418|5|Product exactly as described. Very pleased!
B00IR57FB2|5|true to size
B0018OLYK2|4|I bought this because the blue version was so awesome. This one is not quite as nice; the velvet is thinner, you can follow every contour (yes I mean nipples) through it, an it's not in any way supportive-- it's quite flimsy. But it is comfortable and provides good coverage. I am a very busty person-- size 36HH-- and it fits me quite well. If you are smaller, it may not be as flattering. It would work with a bra underneath, but the bottom does not go straight across-- it is curved, so the center front bottom of the bra might show, if you are generously proportioned.<br />It works well for my purposes, though, so there you have it.  (I'm gonna go leave this exact same review on the white one, because when the blue one fit I bought every color they had.)
B000OAZQZK|5|Price is right, fits fine.
B00PZG0TQ4|4|Very soft material, fits as expected!
B00MV340L4|5|Beautiful,,,looks better in person, but just way to big. Love how it spreads out. I just changed my mind instead of getting a smaller size.
B00N0MX2YG|4|I am pretty pleased (especially for the price). I went a size up because of what I read in other reviews and Im soooo glad I did. I normally wear 8-8.5 but there is no way I would have been comfortable in an 8. So my advice is to SIZE UP (especially if you normally wear half sizes)! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because a small part of the stitching on the front of one them is a little loose, other than that I love them!
B00N40AZY4|1|was under the impression it would fit my newborn baby... i was wrong... the fit is for a 1-2 year old or older... even though it shows it on an infant in the photos... comes no where close to fitting his head.
B00L8D1UVQ|2|poor construction, cheap feeling fabric, misshapen.
B008ABN28S|4|They are very nice. They waist runs about a size larger. My husband wares a 32/30 but I could have easily ordered a 30/28
B00GMWPOJM|3|way too small for me.
B005PTQV72|3|I wish the range was further, but it gets the job done. It was a gift. it is neat o
B000RNJE48|5|Awsome great for the lake!!!!
B007AAUZOE|4|It 's nice , I could say nothing but nice !<br />I was so happy I could buy the jacket with such a nice price
B000PKRKD0|5|I just wore it right after I received it :-D  I like the match of its colors and the picture of Shana is really cool.  The fabric of the product is soft and easy-ironed too.
B00ZV7LT2U|1|SHAME ON YOU CARHARTT! Originally I ordered the FRR45 (see review) and returned for it's webbing buckle because Carhartt said there was no manufacture changes and that it should of been a single release buckle, as per picture and description. So I ordered a pair strait from Carhartt model 101627 because the FRR45 discontinued.  Their web pictures and catalog page 140 show a single release not the 1/2 inch thick x 1.5 inch wide webbing buckle double release it comes with. It has been over a month long nightmare just to get them to admit what they did. Not even the sales office or supervisors knew of the manufacture changes till I called abd they pulled a pair into their office and examined them saying same as me, it looked off and requested production to audit inventory. Now the truth comes out after back and forth. Carhartt changed the single release buckles to a webbing buckle. In order to cut corners with as little work as possible they purposely flipped the top part of the buckle (which has a curve to it) and did not use a webbing slider to keep the loose ends down for safety that could get caught in something. Also the way they flipped it makes the elastic be over the top, pushing a 1/2 inch of plastic into your chest, uncomfortable. I took one of the Style #101627 straps apart and re-threaded them the correct way and found out why they did it this way. The FR elastic Carhartt uses is black on one side and black with red strip on other, putting it on correctly means that it would flip up and show the underside black with red stripe. Last email I received from Carhartt they said they would forward on the safety concern of lack of using a web slider for the loose ends to the FR department.<br /><br />If you look at any other pair of FR bibs from other companies that use a webbing buckle they put out the extra few cents and include the webbing slider in the design and they do not thread them this way (National Safety Apparel, Rasco, Lakeland). Even Carhartt PVC Rain Bib Overalls includes a clip for slack adjusted elastic ends that uses a webbing buckle.Shame on you Carhartt for knowingly cutting corners to change the buckle for whatever reason and not even putting up pictures of the product with the correct buckle (probably because you know it looks stupid) or even changing the wording in the description that still says, &#34;FR elastic suspenders and FR center-release buckles.&#34; Carhartt said it wasn't intentional yet they have been doing this throughout a discontinued FRR45 to the newer  Style #101627 and not even the sales people or supervisors knew about the major changes. This is what you should of done in changing the buckle..... use a double sided elastic, use a webbing slider for safety, place the buckle correctly for comfort.  Or just leave the other single release buckle as it was.<br /><br />Carhartt stood for quality safety work wear. Not anymore. What other corners are they cutting?n Bib Overalls includes a clip for slack adjusted elastic ends that uses a webbing buckle.Shame on you Carhartt for knowingly cutting corners to change the buckle for whatever reason and not even putting up pictures of the product with the correct buckle (probably because you know it looks stupid) or even changing the wording in the description that still says, &#34;FR elastic suspenders and FR center-release buckles.&#34; Carhartt said it wasn't intentional yet they have been doing this throughout a discontinued FRR45 to the newer  Style #101627 and not even the sales people or supervisors knew about the major changes.

B00K63N7WY|3|The material is really gross. Its some polyester blend, it feels like tarp more than a shirt.
B005FLNMPO|5|I love this belt. It came on time and its great quality. It was the perfect size and my daughter loved it.
B000J9YQPM|5|Great quality for the price! Really want to pick up more. Very comfy for workouts or any heavy use in the summer.
B00C15VD3K|5|great had for the price, ran a little large (said newborn hat) but I bought it for my 2 year olds costume and it fit perfectly
B00BTIL0MO|5|I hate baby socks.  They never stay on, and if they are tight enough they leave marks on baby's ankles.  These work perfectly over the socks.  I even use them on the barefoot sandals for my little girl.  Now if only they could combine the sock ons with socks so we only have to put on one product, perfection.
B00GUYU63G|5|Absolutely perfect!
B003JJKTHS|5|I love the look and the price of the glasses.<br />My daughter bought me my first pair .....which I misplaced/lost and I wanted to replace them.<br />My only disappointment was that in order to receive the style I wanted I had to go up in strength.
B00801Q4MO|5|love this shirt; I cant stop wearing it!! not only is it the color of a usmc skivvy shirt, but its overall built complements my body very well. The neck its perfect, the sleeves are the right length, the print looks awesome and its not those thin flimsy shirts. I highly recommend this shirt!!!
B00KIHSKLG|5|This was a Halloween costume for my 12 year old daughter. She LOVES it! It's a little large on her (ordered a small and she wears a preteen size 12/14) but that's expected as it's an adult dress. That was ok because she wore leggings and a long sleeve shirt underneath for warmth. The quality was as expected-it's thin material like a sundress & it's a pretty blue color. Also-the dress was sent promptly which was really appreciated because I ordered it only a week before Halloween and received it within a few days. Thank you!!
B00CIPJV4Q|2|Cheaply made and already broke
B00QFRW71W|5|I own 9 of these shirts (different colors). I have no problem paying good money for good quality, and I haven't been disappointed yet
B00MGBBULE|5|This new fit is awesome, plus they're a little stretchy! I've been a muscular athlete all my life, with a little bit extra put on later in life. With the size of my thighs and/or butt, I've normally had to get pants 2-4 inches larger than these in the waist, and they've just made me look fat. These, however, have more room in the butt and thighs and just fit awesome. I bought 3 pairs, and they all fit great.
B00EID443O|2|tore apart after one wear...
B00K7ERHXC|3|These sunglasses arrived today.  I love the look and fit but they are not glass lens as described in the info.  Very disappointed in the fact that they were said to be one thing but obviously another. Not sure if I will be keeping these or returning. If you're looking for a glass lens..these are not the ones for you!
B00FGFCLKG|3|It states x-large. I have to say, it sure does not seem like it. As I take x-large and this is somewhat small.
B00245IA0G|5|Super comfy but runs a bit long in the legs
B0078EWF0O|4|Needed a hat for my dreadlocks. I don't know why I expected the brim to be hard. This is soft neoprene that I could have sewed on myself. My kid keeps pulling the brim, and it moves out of place so easily that I have to pull it all off and put it back on. I'll keep trying, but I'll probably end up using something else
B00CJ5DBNM|5|Great fit, good product and nice material used.  My good lady looks incredible and sexy in this, so much so I dont want her to take it off but apparently would be frowned upon at work!!
B0034G65W4|5|this are great panties, was kind of leary to order these off the net but was really surprised they fit great and will be ordering again
B00QAT2SQY|5|Looks great and fits many sizes. My wife loved it.
B00LEIAJRQ|5|After trying on so many bras i cant even count this one finally fit me! i love it. its so comfortable. i wish there were more colors so i could own a bunch of them
B00LAD6R1M|5|Good fit, nice feel. warm
B000E4JYNG|5|Purchased for ballet class. The size we ordered fits as it should.  These became my daughters favorite ones to wear.  She said it was smooth, felt good, and was not too tight on her.
B00C6EU1TS|5|I bought this for my husband to wear to our son's Halloween carnival. However my husband who normally wears a large found it to be a little too tight. The color of the shirt itself is very unique, like a \\"rust\\" color and would be cool to wear besides Halloween time. Too bad they don't offer it on Amazon as an X-Large. So I'm returning it. :(
B00D8FJFLY|3|Adorable purse.  Cute colors. Just a lot smaller than I thought it would be although I didn't read the dimensions.
B0063GHNY6|5|As a Harry Potter fan, I absolutely love this shirt! It fits true to size, if you know what size your are in typical juniors shirts. The text &#34;Gryffindor&#34; on the back is why I bought it and I couldn't be happier. A true must have for any Potter fan. I just wish they had Ravenclaw too : (
B00IH2GSR2|5|Great pj's, easy to put on, and great for hot summer nights. They run small, just order one size bigger and they fit great. Love the cut designs.
B009QIYY0O|5|just got these board shorts (first time ordering on line)alredy have them on and went to the beach alredy and they are awsome fit perfectly and feel great and i love them alredy probly in my top ten pairs of board shorts they are water reistant they are not as strechy as a pair of jordy freak`s but they are still a good pair of board shorts
B008YWF85S|5|thx
B00UBUY0UU|2|I'm a size medium in all bathing suits --I'm a size 6/7.  This bathing suit is cute but runs very small.  I'd suggest going up 2 sizes if you purchase.
B00BJORMES|5|Excellent
B004QMLR00|5|it is still a powerful tool for thor and his friends
B007P1VG7S|5|Seller was fast to ship this item with prompt attention. This is a very nice item however it runs alittle small so you may want to order a sizr larger than expected.
