0451452739|4.0|From a freshman: I thought this book was a story that can't be put down. You just keep reading and reading. I liked it because it made your mind dart to different conclusions every sentence. it linked the evolution of  man with finding signs of civilization on Saturn. All in all, this book was  one of the best I've read.
B00003CX5A|4.0|Tim Burton never disappoints when it comes to visual power - he gets that spooky place in your heart and mind precisely the way you want it.  Though major - and sometimes crazy - liberties are taken with the original legend,  this movie surely delivers a rush of spooky delights, and Johnny Depp, in a  mannered and winning performances, is delightful.  The charging horses  through the fog of an impossibly scary/beautiful forest make your heart  pound, though the movie is not as memorable as some other Burton creations  (Nightmare/Christmas; Edward Scissorhands).  Definitely not for the faint  of heart, and certainly not for the youngsters -- the gore is in your face;  and given the storyline, there are many, many beheadings, all done with the  amplified sound effects of a sharp blade slashing through the base of one's  skull.
0679805273|4.0|I think this book is a very good book for children to read.  Dr. Suess makes reading very fun and easy by using words that rhyme together.  It uses places of fiction to expand a childs mind and get him/her thinking of  where they can go in the future.
B00004C4L6|2.0|If you're familiar with Tangerine Dream only as a synthesiser group, specialising in &quot;New Age Ambient&quot; music (as many people think of them), then &quot;Electronic Meditation&quot; will come as something of a  shock. This was the embryonic Tangerine Dream's first record release,  recorded in October 1969, a couple of years before even the name Tangerine  Dream had been heard outside of Germany.<br />Bear in mind that 1969 was only  five years or so after Robert Moog and David Buchla almost simultaneously  released the world's first commercial electronic music synthesisers: such  instruments were still rare, expensive, and of fairly limited capabilities  back then, and the 'electronic' of the title refers not to the use of any  such instrument, but rather to the treatments applied to the sound produced  from the standard acoustical instruments--guitars and piano (Edgar Froese),  cello and violin (Conrad Schnitzler) and drum-kit and metal sticks (Klaus  Schulze)--and the use of Farfisa organ. The music itself is difficult to  describe unless you're already familiar with the cult experimental  free-form rock that was prevalent across continental Europe (especially  Germany) in the late 60s. If you imagine three guys hammering and scraping  away and generally torturing their instruments, often with little or no  seeming regard for what their fellow group members are doing at the time,  then you'll have a pretty fair idea! But don't let that put you off: this  is important music which at one time had a huge cult following and it  deserves to be heard still. And, who knows, you may even discover that you  like it! <br />Be warned, however, that this disc runs for fewer than 35  minutes. (Hence the paucity of stars!) And it was recorded 'live' in an old  warehouse, using less than the highest of fi recording gear, so it has a  much lower dynamic range than we're used to hearing these days, and in  parts sounds positively muddy. Which was probably intended...  Youshould  also be aware that there is three disc boxed set of early TD releases which  includes this album, together with &quot;Alpha Centauri&quot; and  &quot;Zeit&quot;, which-if you can find a copy-is great value.<br />  Incidentally, if you do find you like it and want to hear more like it,  then you should definitely check out the other early Tangerine Dream  albums, &quot;Atem&quot;, &quot;Zeit&quot; and &quot;Green Desert&quot;, as  well as the early musics of Klaus Schulze and other experimental groups of  the time, like Amon Dhul and Cosmic Jokers. Or you may prefer to explore  the more up-to-date approach to experimental electronic music-making, by  investigating the many treasures available from Centaur Records and the  Consortium to Distribute Computer Music releases, or the electroacoustic  masterpieces on offer from Diffusion i Media...
6305265666|5.0|Yet another rendition of the old story of Cinderella.  The girl whose father dies and is unfortunately raised by her very wicked step-mother.  Throw in a fairy god-mother and voila, she lives happily ever after with  her Prince Charming.  Yes, you know how the story goes and you know how the  story ends.  Still though, this movie breathes new life to the old  story!<br />&quot;Ever After&quot; has a great cast of actors and actressess  that meshed perfectly together on the screen.  Every character played in  this version was perfectly casted into each of their respective roles and  brought a magical touch to the movie's script.  I especially have to pay  homage to both Drew Barrymore's portrayal as the &quot;poor cinder  girl&quot;, Cinderella and to Angelica Huston's fantastically fiendish  version of the wicked step-mother.  From the trailer I had seen on the  film, I initially thought Drew's acting was overly done.  But I was way too  quick to pass judgement (especially when all I had seen is the trailer).  She did a wonderful job!  Angelica Huston has instantly made me a believer  in her ability to act.  Previously, I've seen her work in the Addams Family  movies, but never really thought too much of her acting until I saw her  rendition of the wicked step-mother.  I was awestrucked.  You just have to  see her performance yourself to understand.<br />This movie lacks special  effects, but so what!  What it does have is everything else: a great  script, great acting, directing, and even visuals (without the aid of  special effects).  This is what a true cinematic experience is all about.  To be captivated by a simple story with nothing more than just plain good  acting, good writing, and great direction.  The entire family can enjoy  this movie.<br />Lastly though, as a DVD, it rates rather poorly.  This is  only due to the lack of extra features one comes to expect out of movies  set on the DVD format.  Other than that, I really could not find any other  flaw.  It's a smart and wonderful cinematic experience and would make a  nice addition to anybody's video library!w.

B00003CX5A|5.0|&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; could be called the best film by Tim Burton, it shows him moving up in the world from the &quot;Batman,&quot; &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; stuff which was good, but this is better. &quot;Sleepy  Hollow&quot; is visually hypnotic and frighteningly fun. It works best as  an art film, filled with so much richness in set design, costume design and  cinematography. Burton takes us into his own little world here, and it's a  great experience. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker (Seven, 8MM) is in  the tradition of great storytelling, filled with entertaining characters  and ridiculous situations of gothic fantasy that never keep us from being  entertained or from having a good time. I do not condone it's R rating and  would take a kid to see this movie. It's great, visual storytelling that at  some points has the feeling of classic cinema. &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is  a rich, dazzling work of the imagination. A great blend of creativity with  storytelling. Burton's true masterpiece in atmosphere and art.
B00004T1HK|5.0|This is by far, the better of Britney's two albums.  Whereas &quot;...Baby, One More Time&quot;  was typical teen bubblegum, this is still teen pop, but there are much harder and more seductive grooves and  rhthyms.  There are still some icky ballads like &quot;Dear Diary&quot;   but those are few and far between with this fantastic effort.  Highlights  are the title track, &quot;Stronger,&quot;  &quot;Satisfaction&quot;  (good  cover), &quot;What U See (Is What U Get),&quot;  and &quot;One Kiss From  You.&quot;  However, almost all of the songs on the album are good, and  you'll find that it's definetly worth your money.  Go check this one out,  and you'll see that Britney is THE definitive queen of teen pop!
B000002UAX|5.0|To all non beatle fans--go review other stuff.  This is a way to review albums, not bands.  We do not care that you don't like the band,  thus your review and you are ignored.  The White Album is great because it does have  great music,  it is very unique, and it is a blast to listen to.  Is every  song great?  no.  But this album is great because it is so different.  It  is not for the bubblegummers or the bandwagon fans.  This album is a huge  part of history and will never go away.
B00000K0E5|4.0|Pierce Brosnan makes his first appearance as 007, as the franchise returns after 6 years. This is a wonderful Bond film. Maybe one of the best! Bond and his partner 006 are raiding a Russian chemical plant. 007 thinks 006 is  killed but he was really a trader. 9 years later Bond discovers a plot that  involves 006. The plot is to target cities with the Goldeneye satalite and  hold the cities for ransom(big surprise!). Alec Trevelyn(006) is the man  behing the villiany. This Bond outing is much different from the older  ones. It has much more violence and uses a different format. Even none Bond  fans will enjoy! Rated  PG-13 for violence, sexual situations, and sexual  content.
B000002OX7|5.0|I remember buying this album in the seventies.  It was great then and it is even better now.  What a great bonus of tunes.  The sound quality is unbelieveable especially compared to my old worn out album.  This is one of  those unique music collections where every track is good and easy to listen  straight through.<br />If you are unfamiliar with the Who.....this is  probably your best bet as a starter album.
0790730960|4.0|It is Christmas time in Gotham City. 33 years ago a deformed child was thrown into a river by his selfish parents. In the sewer he grew up to become the Penguin, because he was raised by penguins. Now in present day  Gotham, Penguin(Danny DeVito) is ready to rise up from the sewers. Mega  Gotham buisness man Max Schreck helps Pengiun get on the mayor campaign so,  Scherck(Christopher Walken) can build his mega power plant that will drain  power from the city. Selina Kyle is a scretary for Schreck. She finds out  about the plant and she is pushed out the window by him. She comes back to  life and becomes Catwoman(Michele Pfieffer). And Penguin and Catwoman cook  up a scheme to frame Batman. Batman/Bruce Wayne(Michael Keaton)must protect  Gotham form these menicing villians. This movie is the best Batman! But one  flaw it suffers is that Michael Keaton is missing in a lot of scenes.  Otherwise awsome! Rated PG-13 for violence, brief sexual scene, and brief  language.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is an album that will live as long as people listen to music.  It is still fresh to this day and will remain so.  Each tune flows so well and is pleasing for a casual stress-free listen or a party with a lot of people.  If you don't have it and remotely like (or maybe even if you don't)the  Beatles I think you will really enjoy it.
B000002WPI|5.0|Writing this e-mail from the University of Puget Sound campus, I must say this is a super record! I've never heard of WTC before until I bought this purfect album! A delight to the senses! From the first song until the last  song, the WTC kept devil ering phat beats! On VH-1's The List even the  audience members voted this group as being one of the 90's best! I'm going  to listen to their other records! They are so HHHOOOTTT!  Check out my  reviews to the Villiage People! Another fabulous group!
6305750750|1.0|This movie was awful.  The reason I didn't suffer too much is because it did have some good visuals and special effects.  That was all this film had that was good.  The acting was the worst in years.  The story was  non-exsistent.  Did we even care about any of the characters?  And as for  the worst of all the villains.  They were unintersting and not even worth  disliking.  This movie was a waste of a lot of money (not just mine) and it  seems as it were forced.  It does not even deserve the name of star wars.
B00001ODHF|5.0|This odd one is about this misadventures of a typical male who gets sent back into the middle ages.  There he meets up with a few knights and more than a few arisen dead.  This movie is the third in the Evil Dead Series.   A series that has scared and humored.  I had the luxuary of seeing this  movie in the theaters and was taken in by it.  This is a great movie for  any guy to rent.  The movie runs like a video game, and never has a dull  moment.  Buy this and you will definitely get your moneys worth.
0440211727|5.0|A Time to Kill; by John Grisham. If you like murder, suspense, tragedy, and gore this is the book for you. I must warn you that if you are faint of heart this wouldn't probably appeal to you. But if the things I listed above describe your type of book, I definitely advise you to read this.   Clanton, Mississippi. The life of a ten-year-old girl is shattered by two  drunken and uncaring young men. The mostly white town reacts with shock and  terror at the inhuman crime. Until the father of the little black girl  takes justice into his own hands.  For ten days, as burning crosses and  the crack of sniper fire spread through the streets of Clanton, the nation  stands aghast as a young defense lawyer, Jake Brigance, defends the loving  father trying to save his life, and then Jake must fight for his own.    This tense, compelling, and emotional book is wonderfully written by the  author of \\"The Pelican Brief\\" and \\"The Firm\\" and it proves to be right up  to their standards. Putting aside the very flagrant language and the small  amount of sexual activity it is still a fabulous book and it is very  realistic. I loved it!
6304406096|4.0|Although this is not a true Bond movie, missing many features that are in normal ones, it's still a great movie. Having great action, this movie deserves four stars.
6300182282|5.0|I saw the stage play of SAME TIME NEXT YEAR in the late 70's or early 80's at Detroit's Fisher Theatre. It was excellent. When the movie came out, I was in line. I then saw it on TV and have subsequently purchased it. It is the only movie that I watch over and over. I love the song, \\"The Last Time I Felt Like This\\" and can be found on CD \\"The Best of Johnny Mathis 1975-1980\\". The story might appeal to anyone who has ever loved someone outside of a committed marriage. If this were to happen to me, I would be torn as to whether this idea would actually work in real life.  It must be a fantasy, but it's a tantalizing idea.
0140288503|4.0|I flew in and out of Mogadishu in 1993, in support of the New Zealand airforce and army teams stationed there as part of the UN effort. A few months after I headed my Herc for home from what we saw as little more than  a slightly exotic, mildly interesting destination, the events in this book  unfolded.<br /> While the geography was familiar, the intensity of the battle  and the underlying tension that must have preceded it shocked me. While  waiting for our Herc to be refuelled we drove to the airfield perimeter and  bought souvenirs from the locals. After that we went to the top of the  dunes where a bunch of Rangers were having their pictures taken in front of  a pair of Hummers. Sure, there were plenty of weapons and wire, but it  didn't seem like a hot zone in the least. <br /> This book shows how wrong we  - and perhaps the American public and government - were. It tells the story  of a Ranger/Delta mission into the middle of Mogadishu that, while  technically successful, cost 18 troops (and 500-odd Somalis) their lives.  Its battlefield narrative is the most thorough I have ever read and draws  on an incredible amount or research and interviews with participants from  both sides.<br /> What stood out for me though, was that despite having  operated into Mog just months before the battle - and so having at least a  passing interest in stories on the area - I never realised it had happened.  As Colin Powel mentions in the book, in Vietnam an 18-casualty engagement  wouldn't have warranted a press conference. But this isn't Vietnam, and the  lack of attention the Battle of the Black Sea received is perhaps the most  worrying aspect of this book.<br /> If I had a reservation about recommending  Black Hawk Down, it would be that the level of detail is so great it  sometimes becomes a blur, and one name or event fades into another. But  this is a small criticism of a strongly written, if sometimes disturbing  (not for younger readers) book.
0767817710|3.0|Director Sam Raimi's homage to Sergio Leone and the spaghetti western was scorned by critics and audiences when it first came out.  This film definitely deserves another look, though, on video or DVD.<br />In a delicious  performance, Sharon Stone appears as a mysterious gunslinger with a  troubled past (the Clint Eastwood role).  Gene Hackman plays her villainous  nemesis, and a pre-Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio also appears.  Stone hasn't  done much worthwhile in several years now, which is too bad.  When you see  her play strong female parts like this one, you can see the promise she  shows as an actress.<br />The story in &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; is  repetitive and the characters are mono-dimensional, but the direction is so  stylish and quirky that it more than makes up for the bad writing.  (You  can't help but love flashy shots like viewing the action through a  newly-shot hole in a gunfighter's hand.)<br />This film will probably appeal  most to film buffs and fans of the Western.
6305176299|4.0|&quot;Die Hard&quot; was the prototype for the 90s action film and &quot;Speed&quot; remains one of the best reworkings of it.  It delivers enough non-stop action and thrills to satisfy even the most-demanding  action fans.<br />Keanu Reeves (who'd have believed it before &quot;The  Matrix&quot;?) stars as Jack Traven, LAPD SWAT commando.  Traven and his  partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) battle one-thumbed mad bomber Howard Payne  (Dennis Hopper) throughout nearly two hours of wall-to-wall testosterone  and mayhem.<br />The script by virgin screenwriter Graham Yost delivers not  one, but three thrilling disaster stories, accomplishing that rare  Hollywood miracle of actually giving the audience more than they  expected.<br />Reeves gives a surprisingly good performance, showing  uncharacteristic confidence and ease.  Daniels is largely wasted and Hopper  gives his stock crazed villain performance--and once again I loved it.  The  always delightful Sandra Bullock, co-starring as Reeve's love interest, is  excellent, giving just the right touch to her scenes.<br />&quot;Speed&quot;  was a remarkable directorial debut for veteran cinematographer Jan De Bont.   He obviously learned a great deal while lensing pictures for Paul  Verhoeven (&quot;Basic Instinct&quot;) and John McTiernan (&quot;The Hunt  for Red October.&quot;)  The action sequences and stunts in this film are  as good as any you'll see.  This is one movie that really delivers.
B000002KHH|5.0|I, too, was raised on this record. I'm convinced my brothers played it for me when I was a baby in the crib. I can recite the lyrics to most of the songs without even thinking about it. Most of my life I've had a copy and  listened to it frequently. There's nothing quite like it, and I'm happy  there is such a thing as this.
B000002KE2|4.0|Band went pretty much downhill after this. This one has the hardest sludge-guitar you ever heard. &quot;Supernaut&quot; is a brilliant song. Contrary to the consensus here, I'm actually fond of &quot;St. Vitus'  Dance.&quot; It has a kind of plaintive jauntiness you wouldn't expect from  Sabbath. I'm also not convinced that &quot;Snowblind&quot; is all it's  cracked up to be.
630439845X|4.0|Holly Hunter was excellent. She spoke to me even though she never said a word. I felt her pain and her need to be excepted for who she really was. Harvey was my hero in the end.
6303109950|5.0|Excellent, if you like westerns and love stories. Wyatt was loyal to family and friends. Even though Wyatt and two of his brothers moved to Tombstone to be together and make money, he couldn't escape who he was and  what he had been. And through circumstance he became a lawman again. He  also had a friend, Doc who was loyal to him in return. They stuck together  until the end. I found Doc to be funny, educated, daring and a man seeming  to have no fear. My reference to this being a love story also is because of  the relationship developing between Josephine and Wyatt and how in the end  he found her and made her his own for the rest of their lives.
6303402348|4.0|Even though it is a silly story I like it because it is a love story. It touched my heart because of the love!
B00000K2SD|5.0|What a concept! I love the special effects! And it is also capitalizes on the theory of mind over matter.
6304106017|4.0|At first I was so caught up with the characters in the beginning that I even forgot that it was a vampire movie. But boy was it ever a vampire movie, expect for the ladies dancing before they turned, and even them  after they turned, it had to be the ugliest vampires I have ever seen! My  favorite part is when Salma Hayek came out and was dancing, and then what a  scary monster she turned into!
B00004RFFU|5.0|I find the movie to be beautiful yet sad. Lestat doesn't seem to question his existence, he just makes the best of it. Whereas Louis wants to understand, reason and find meaning. When he finds only despair, then there  is Claudia. At first she doesn't question, but as time goes on she too  wants answers. Mysterious Armand has answers, however, they are just for  Louis.
B000007OY0|5.0|What a movie! I love Tim's way of seeming as though he was the teacher's pet most of time, when he never ever was! And what a surprise they all got when he was gone. Just goes to show you that a honest man sentenced for a  crime that he didn't commit when put in a certain circumstance can become  what he must to survive. And right the wrong and save himself! And that  evil is sometimes hiding behind a false face, someone who is pretending to  be a good man.
6305718903|3.0|This movie makes you think and question what one might believe.
B00003CXDV|3.0|It wouldn't have been as funny to me had I not seen Star Trek. I liked the bad outerspace monster.
078062369X|4.0|I love the beginning of this movie with the bloodbath and the fighting. And the music is killer, the soundtrack is a must have if you like Techno! I like the half human half vampire, superbeing, with a purpose!
B00003CX59|4.0|The darkness of a Tim Burton movie always appeals to me. As does the darkness of any Christopher Walken character. My favorite part of the movie is when the headless horseman would leap out of the tree. As for Johnny  Depp well, he fits sad and questioning characters and I like to see him  work with Christopher Walken and in Tim Burton movies, it just fits.
6305807086|4.0|Strange movie. John Malkovich is why I liked it. I find him strange in any movie that he is in. Even more so in this one especially when he is inside himself and all around him there he is. I laughed when he was singing,  dressed as a female laying across the piano.
0425107469|5.0|When I read this book some years ago I considered this to be among his very best work.  It starts out simple enough and transforms into a heartpounding immensely enjoyable book.  Einstein (the dog) was a creation  that I felt deeply for.  The main characters gave the story life and you  almost could feel the terror they were put into.  I felt great sympathy for  The Outsider (the beast).  I consider this to be the most evilest villian  Koontz put on paper and at the sametime felt very sorry for it at the  conclusion of the book.  All of Koontz's work is brilliant and I am an avid  fan because he writes intriguing stories and can entertain me for hours on  end and that is what I like most about reading and Dean Koontz has done  that like no other!
B0000024UF|4.0|An album with some great songs (&quot;Bird on the Wire&quot;, &quot;Story  of Isaac&quot;, &quot;The Partisan&quot;, &quot;Seems So Long Ago,  Nancy&quot;), and some not-so-great but not-too-bad songs (pretty much  everything else).  Not a bad album by any means, but doesn't really contain  enough to stand out as one of Cohen's best.
0767805534|4.0|When &quot;Easy Rider&quot; was released in 1969, it marked a turning point in the history of the American cinema. It took the independent film movement--practiced for so long by Roger Corman and others--and thrust it forward into the spotlight and, eventually, the mainstream. Made for under a million dollars, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; eventually grossed close to fifty, and opened Hollywood's eyes to a whole new area of potential profits. The American film was never to be the same again.<br />The story is a simple one: two hippies (Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper) riding their motorcycles cross-country to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. Along the way they visit a commune, meet some girls, go to a whorehouse, and do lots and lots of drugs. They also get thrown in jail where they meet an alcoholic lawyer, terrifically played by Jack Nicholson in his breakthrough role. The trio then continues on together towards New Orleans, stopping occasionally to smoke some grass and philosophize about life. Eventually, they have a series of strange and violent conflicts with some rednecks that lead to the movie's rather abrupt conclusion.<br />The best aspects of the film are the on-target performances and Laszlo Kovacs' stark cinematography. Also of note is a stunning, hallucinatory montage of an acid trip, complete with a bizarre Catholic motif. The writing (by Fonda, Hopper, and Terry Southern) is strictly ordinary, providing only the barest structure to hang the story on, punctuated by mostly improvised dialog.<br />What made &quot;Easy Rider&quot; different from the ordinary Hollywood films of its time was its rebellious spirit and youthful exuberance, complemented by its loud hippie rock soundtrack. Directed by Hopper and produced by Fonda, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; was the first movie of its kind to reach such a wide audience and gain mainstream acceptance. Its casual portrayal of drug use and confrontational defiance of authority combined to make &quot;Easy Rider&quot; an anthem for young people. Although the film today seems inevitably dated, it still stands as an enduring emblem of its age.
B0000024TT|5.0|Surely others before me have said this, but that one lyric above (from  &quot;Stories of the Street&quot;) does a beautiful job of summarizing the  spirit of the works of Leonard Cohen.  This is one of my favorite albums,  in my top three of Leonard's, and every song on it has lyrics that I wish I  could have written.  The album contains the well-known &quot;Suzanne&quot;  and &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot;, along with eight other songs of varying  degrees of fame which are just as beautiful and haunting as those classics.   <br />Cohen's voice isn't pretty (although his caterwauling in the closing  seconds of the album is pretty funny), but it beats Dylan's any day, and  Leonard is gracious enough to spare us the harmonica.  And the lyrics,  music, and female backup singers are more than enough to overcome his vocal  limitations.<br />As far as early Cohen albums go, this should be the first to  get (or maybe Best of Leonard Cohen, but I've never owned it myself).  It  is probably the most consistent album of his career, in that none of the  songs on it are bad, a feat most of his other albums do not replicate.  Put  simply, this is a remarkable musical debut for a fascinating body of work.
6300214826|5.0|Theres a lot going on in Apocalypse Now. On a purely &quot;wow&quot; level theres the Valkyrie-like helicopter attack, the terrifically scripted narration, great camera work, sound, production, acting etc etc. It's  flawed but this is outweighed by excellent multi-level themes. At the first  level theres the story of Captain Benjamin Willard. He's sent on a mission  to kill a US Special Forces Colonel. The film is an account of the way this  occurs. On another level its about Colonel Walter E. Kurtz and what made  him disobey orders resulting in a death sentence being handed down without  due process by US Army and intelligence community authorities. The plot is  thick with intrigue before Willard even makes it out the door on his  mission. Then theres the story of the men on the boat Willard uses as  transport on his mission to find Kurtz. There just young men thrown into a  situation like you or me. Lance, the surfer, chef, Mr.Clean, the kid from  the Bronx and chief, the boat's skipper. Next theres the war itself and the  public face of that war and its personification of American leadership  values at the time in Colonel Kilgore, played brilliantly by Robert Duvall.  Theres the VC or Viet Cong, a peasant army taking on a super power. With  the VC is the jungle and the Americans landed there like aliens in  Manhattan. This last story is the back drop for the whole film. Privately  Willard is in turmoil. The opening sequence is really the conclusion of the  story, hence 'The End' song by the Doors. Willard is tormented by the war,  the killing he's had to do, the jungle, the phantom enemy of the VC growing  stronger in the jungle,  while he sits and waits for a mission in the hotel  room, growing softer. Willard is at breaking point, his narrative through  the film as he says himself is a confession. He's had enough of the war, as  much as this one man can take. He's just trying to get through it. As such  'Apocalypse Now' does not need to be set in a war which America lost,  though this is handy in working on the national guilt and moral ambiguity  the war dragged American leadership values into. This is the significance  of the film for righting the damage to American prestiege thirty years ago.  A kind of re-birth. The moral quagmire which 'Apocalypse Now' superbly  demonstrates is the crux of the book 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad  from which the film is adapted. The process of being in such a quagmire,  what this might feel like, the impact of it, are teased out by Francis Ford  Coppola in his movie. As much as in the book the symbolism of the journey  on a river to its source is brilliantly done on film. As a journey into a  persons self to discover truth in what appears like a bottomless pit, is  well parralleled in pictures, as it is in words. Both book and film are  modern masterpieces.
B000002AZX|4.0|During the five years between Recent Songs and this album, Cohen's voice became the sound of a tired God.  That voice suits this album very well.  Several of the songs deal with questions of faith and hope, including one  of Cohen's best songs, &quot;If It Be Your Will&quot;.  This is not an  album I enjoyed thoroughly upon first listen, but over the years it has  grown on me and is now one of my favorites.  Not all the songs are great,  but songs like &quot;Dance Me to the End of Love&quot;, &quot;The Night  Comes On&quot;, and &quot;Hallelujah&quot; make it well worth the price.  I  must say, though, that the version of Hallelujah included on this album is  not as good as the cover versions by Jeff Buckley and John Cale.  Still, a  very worthy addition to Cohen's body of work.
B000025AJM|5.0|Wow. That's all I have to say. This CD is simply fantastic. I came across it while doing an English 12 research paper on Prog rock and decided I simply had to buy it. The consummate skill and mind-bogglingly complex  songwriting of Fripp, McDonald, et. al. is simply beyond anything I've ever  experienced. It's a shame I wasn't born yet when this lineup was touring. I  highly recommend tracks &quot;Schizoid Man,&quot; &quot;I Talk to the  Wind,&quot; and &quot;Crimson King.&quot; &quot;Epitaph,&quot; I think,  lags behind just a bit. The only time I lost interest in the album was  during the improv section of &quot;Moonchild,&quot; which I think goes on  too long and lacks focus. However, the rest of the album more than makes up  for this flaw, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. Now I just need  to save up my money and buy Larks, Red, and Discipline.
B000002AZZ|5.0|A great collection of songs here, mostly exploring the areas of love and war.  Probably the most famous song on the album is &quot;Chelsea Hotel #2&quot;, a loving (but not too loving) tribute to Janis Joplin.  Other  highlights are &quot;Take This Longing&quot;, &quot;A Singer Must  Die&quot;, &quot;Who By Fire&quot;, &quot;There is a War&quot;, and  &quot;Is This What You Wanted&quot;.  And this is one of his few albums  that doesn't have at least one screechingly bad song to ruin the flow.   Can't go wrong buying this one.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Wow. This hits a new level of rap. Eminem blows everyting out of the water. If Tupac is the best rapper ever, than Eminem is a close second. I live how he disses teen pop stars like Christina Agularia and N'sync. The  beats are phat, and you know they would be because Dre makes great beats.  The songwriting is excellent. Please don't only see that he's white. If he  were black, would he be any better? Be prepared, because the rest of the CD  isn't anything like The Real Slim Shady. He raps with a lot of anger and  intensity. But get it anyway, because it's the best thing to hit stores  since the Slim Shady LP.
B0000028W9|4.0|A great album to pass the time while you're waiting for the miracle to come.  It's marred by a couple of rather useless cover songs, but the original material on this album is all pretty strong.  Even &quot;Closing  Time&quot;, which makes me laugh at an image of Leonard Cohen at a square  dance in my head when I hear it, has good lyrics to make up for its country  music influences.  Cohen's voice has never sounded better than it does on  this album, especially on &quot;Waiting For the Miracle&quot;, a personal  favorite.  Not as consistent as I'm Your Man, but easier to get into than  Various Positions, it's a very good latter-day Leonard album.
B00003CWQ2|3.0|I loved Brad Pitt and Edward Norton is a freak! This movie is definitely a  mind trip. You have to see it to believe it.
B0000026J6|5.0|Buy it.  If you're looking for the place to start your Leonard Cohen collection, this is it.  Skip &quot;Jazz Police&quot; every time you hear the first note, and you've got a perfect album.  I often find the word  &quot;catchy&quot; in reviews for this album.  Absolutely true.  And this  is probably the only one of his albums for which that can be said.  It  grabs you from the (very 1980s) pounding synthesizer opening of &quot;First  We Take Manhattan&quot;, slows it down a bit for &quot;Ain't No Cure For  Love&quot;, then brings on the cynicism with &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;.   And after that, you're hooked on Leonard for life.  And you still have four  more great songs (don't forget to skip track six) to go.  &quot;I'm Your  Man&quot;, indeed.
0800135954|4.0|This is a great movie. I hated that even in the end that Brad's character had to die. He had survived so much. It was a very emotional movie. I highly recommend it.
B00000099Y|5.0|To put it in a nutshell - this album is what metallica would sound like if  they overdosed on Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. It's that good. It  really should have been the soundtrack to Fight Club. Intelligent and  innovative, no one else can come close to this for innovative rock.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Almost every track is a winner in my book.  Usually you get a CD for a few and just play them.  But this is definitely a keeper. Way to go Carlos and crew.
B00004T8RK|5.0|For a band that has never caved into popular culture, Pearl Jam has continued to create their own genre of original music.  Binauarl is yet a new level of Pear Jam I have never heard before.  And as expected, it is  wonderful.  This album is a must have for all faithful Pearl Jam followers.   I predict Vedder and friends will continue to surprize even the most  dedicated fans with new sounds like this album.  The first listen is a bit  awkward because it is a different sould for Pearl Jam, but after a few  times through you can hear the beauty shine through.  Jam on!
B00004SCX6|1.0|Yes, she did it again.  She duplicated the sound of her first album almost to a tee.  For that, she gets an A.  But this album just further proves that she will not be around for long.  She shows no growth and has the same teeny bop voice that she has always had. Her rendition of  &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is a complete disgrace to the song and the Rolling  Stones.  Another flash in the pan, another teenage media-made pinup.  Her  best performance does not even come close to Christina Aguilera's worst.
0792844890|5.0|Well, I can sum everything I thought of the movie in just a few words.   Classic, hilarious, superb, and most of all...the funniest dawg-on spoof of  another movie I had ever seen.  Definitely a classic in my eyes, and an all  time favorite!
B00001ODHJ|5.0|The filming in each of the three Evil Dead movies is simply amazing. Some of the sequences make you wonder how in the world they ever thought up this stuff. While the first two are a little more horror and this is a little  more comedy, they are all classics. Bruce Campbell is great and is also one  of the only actors that can truly pull off the many one-liners that are  present in these films. I have heard of a sequel coming out in the form of  a computer game. This might put off some avid movie buffs, but with Bruce  Campbell back in the picture you can sign me up!
B000002UA0|5.0|The trippiness of London's hottest underground act in the late 1960s was led by Syd Barrett, known for his overt pop tunes and propensity for ingesting psychadelic drugs. A recluse in the years before his death, Barrett's contributions to Pink Floyd when the band started cannot be overestimated; Syd WAS the band. He sang, wrote and influenced many aspiring musicians. When he was kicked out later for severely erratic behavior, Barrett's personality and travails provided neverending quantities of inspiration for such classics as [[ASIN:B000024D4S Wish You Were Here]], [[ASIN:B000002U82 Dark Side Of The Moon]] and [[ASIN:B000006TRV The Wall (Deluxe Packaging Digitally Remastered)]]. Barrett was the ringleader for Pink Floyd when the band started, and he evolved into a symbol later on -- mostly a symbol of madness.<br /><br />\\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" contains an unmistakable '60s vibe that may come off as too impossibly retro for modern ears. \\"Astronomy Domine\\" leads off the record, one of the best tracks, a tune easily identifiable with Floyd's spacey, far-out image that followed the band everywhere, both on record and live. With his soft, clipped, unmistakably British vocals, Barrett wonderingly sings, \\"Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten.\\"  His guitar work on Astronomy\\" spirals downward fluently as he croons about images perhaps only his mind ever fully comprehended. \\"Lucifer Sam,\\" with its Batmanesque guitar work, is a tribute to Syd's revered cat: \\"That cat's something I can't explain.\\" (One could argue the same about Syd and many of his tunes.) \\"Matilda Mother\\" is a dreamy, fairy talesque concoction that is quite unique. Even better is \\"Flaming,\\" a melodic, wonderfully written tune with far-out lyrics like \\"laying in the foggy dew...yippee! You can't see me, but I can you!\\" Halfway through, \\"Piper\\" takes a bit of an interlude as Barrett's voice is not heard for three straight songs. Still, his influence remains. \\"Pow R. Toc H.\\" contains jazzy piano by Richard Wright, but turns typically foreboding with strange yelping in the background. The record's biggest mystery is the woefully inept \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\", written by Roger Waters. With its hyper, senseless lyrics and overdrive guitar, it's drastically out of place and ranks as one of the worst song in the entire Pink Floyd catalog. Luckily, the instrumental \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" picks the album back up. It starts off scratchy and live-sounding, then of course turns pokey. The digression is worth it, however, when the guitar jam reasserts itself and switches from one side of your speakers to the other, a technique I've only heard on the album [[ASIN:B000001F7R On Through the Night]] by Def Leppard. Although such songs aren't ear candy, Pink Floyd were always experimental and ahead of its time. Not the greatest musicians in the world (save for [[ASIN:B000ELJBAK David Gilmour]] and Barrett), Floyd eventually found a  way to reward its faithful listeners. The upbeat and strong \\"Bike\\" ends the album, but Barrett makes sure things finish on a severely apprehensive note as the poppiness turns ugly. Sounds of wayward clocks, chiming and a very disturbing duck-like laugh end things on an eerie note. It's scary to see how many \\"normal\\" people actually connect with  this band and Syd Barrett. Whatever Barrett's flaws, he set the launching pad for a group that would become world renowned, the most popular of its time. Faceless and secretive, Pink Floyd would someday rule the world. \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" fittingly never gets much airplay, and that's probably as it should be., but turns typically foreboding with strange yelping in the background.

B00004RHZU|4.0|I just want to say that the beats are really good. In the tradition of Teena Marie and Lisa Stansfield Pink can be added to the short list of really good white R&amp;B singers. She is only 19 but she gives every  impression of staying around for a long time! Her signature track  &quot;There you Go&quot; is full of better than average vocals with  timbaland like basslines. Although I like more rock and pop music this is  one new soul cd I wouldn't mind buying!
B0000028M7|4.0|This is without a doubt a great record and a must for any rock fan who is looking for something different.  &quot;Rooster&quot; is arguably AIC's best song, and &quot;Them Bones&quot; and &quot;Would?&quot; are also among  their best.  But lets be honest; this CD may be awesome, but it is short of  brilliant.  Almost all of the songs are good, but a few of them sound a  little like filler.  Staley's vocals are great too, but there aren't enough  of them because Cantrell did much of the singing on some tracks.  I  personally like some of the other AIC stuff as much or even better, such as  the Jar Of Flies EP and some of the early Man in the Box era songs.  The  one thing I dislike most about AIC is the drumming; after listening to Dave  Grohl pounding away on Nirvana's Nevermind or In Utero, it sounds a little  tame and 80ish.  But even these minor flaws cannot detract from the solid  songs on this album.
0425156842|5.0|I love Gaardner as a writer.  He writes books about the magic of growing up and discovering things.  This is one of his toughest books because the young girl and main character finds these secret packages containing chunks  of the history of philosophy.  Although I'm far from a philosophy expert, I  find Gaardner's explications a heck of a lot easier to understand than many  of the philosophers themselves or the critics who try to explain them.  Short of a philosophy course, this is the best introduction to the major  figures of philosophy you're likely to find, andit's twisted throughout a  novel about growing up.  What an imagination!
B000000W4M|5.0|7 years or so later this Cd is still great. billy corgan took grunge and made music out of it. this is better than &quot;nevermind&quot;. u have hundreds of other reviewers saying the same thing so go buy this Cd if you  don't have it and hear what u have been missing
0684800713|5.0|I think I've read and reread this novel over 15 times through my own reading and teaching English.  It's a key novel for any reading course because more than any other Hemingway novel, it's a book that teaches you  how to read.  Sure, his dialogue is inspired, his descriptions lean and  elegant, but the genius of Hemingway lies in the silences and the gestures.  What could say more than &quot;he looked down&quot; when Montoya realizes  that Jake has betrayed him to Romero?  Or when Jake squeezes Brett's hand  in the car?  This is the key to Hemingway's genius. In the honors 9th grade  class I taught 2 years ago, 22 of my students voted it their favorite novel  of the year (we read perhaps 7) by a landslide.  It's not as easy a book as  you would think, but it bears repeated reading and study.  For my money, I  think it's the greatest thing Hemingway ever wrote except perhaps some of  his short stories like Indian Camp (which you should read for the great  gesture of all time:  he rolled over).  When you read the story, you'll  understand how it's the most important line, but one that's easy to miss.
6304244304|5.0|Very few people can handle this movie. It busts violently out of the mold of everyday filmmaking. It doesn't feel right to classify this film as science fiction. Looking at some of the other reviews I see that most  people like the 1930's and the 1977 version better. That's because those  were both straight-up monster movies. They didn't evoke the emotion,  horror, and tragedy the way this version does. Though it's an updated  adaptation of Wells' dark masterpiece, it has the same spirit. I watched  this movie again today with a friend and he said that it's such an amazing  film because it's one of those completely ingenius ideas. And it certainly  is. <br /> The gentle, subtle uneasiness that Douglas feels at the beginning  of the movie is deftly hinted to the audience. And this soft horror is  mixed with sickening gut shots that dynamically keep the audience  staggering from one insane, yet understandable, event to the next. This  subtext permeates the entire film and is perfectly tied together with the  underlying moral allegory in the beginning and ending voice overs. No one  can say that this film is pointless - yet they do. <br /> The music, the  visual effects, the creature effects, the acting, the direction, the  cinematography are done nearly perfectly.  This film is definitely a  classic, even though most people don't have the insight to see that.
B000002AVF|2.0|Mariah Carey had been riding on top of her wildly successful career for five years when this album was released. I remember buying Music Box on the release date in 1993, thoroughly enjoying the album, then listening to a lot more of Mariah in 1994 while I spent my summer in Asia. I remember, in  particular, one hot afternoon, when I was visiting the highest skyscraper  in Seoul, the entire Music Box was playing in the observation deck, and a  7-year-old boy was singing along nicely without understanding a word of  English; toward the end of 1994, I met Mariah in person and made sure to  mention the Korean boy, not to mention many other fans of hers half a world  away from her New York home. Given this huge mouthful of experiences, I was  looking forward to a new Mariah Carey release, and I had high expectations  for it. I bought this album on the release date - a habit I had developed  by then for Mariah Carey albums.<br />This album fell far short of my  expectations. &quot;Fantasy&quot; was a very horrendous ripoff of  &quot;Genius of Love,&quot; really, and a very bad way to start an album.  &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; with Boyz II Men was more like an effort to break  Whitney Houston's #1 longevity record (&quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;)  than a genuinely good song; it accomplished the goal (after all, Boyz II  Men had their own longevity records), but didn't leave me with too much of  an impression. Most other songs were sloppily put together and just didn't  click at all. The only songs I liked were &quot;Open Arms,&quot; which was  a good rendition of a Journey song, &quot;Forever,&quot; with its 1950's  feel, and to a lesser degree, bouncy &quot;Always Be My Baby.&quot;  Songwriting was downright childish and crude in many spots; no amount of  great voice and arrangement will ever cover that up.<br />The crude  songwriting really bit me hard, when I was listening to this album, as well  as albums by The Cranberries, Amy Grant, and Natalie Merchant, in  succession on a flight to England. (I also added Elton John's &quot;Love  Songs&quot; while in England and on my way back.) While I sincerely  appreciate Mariah's songwriting efforts, sometimes there are times when  things need to be deferred to other people - no need to insist on writing  *every* single frigging song. Comparing Mariah's songwriting to these other  artists' was like comparing chicken scratch writing to fine calligraphy.  That was the final straw for me. And it's only gotten worse since then...  What a perfect way to waste one of the greatest voices there is.
0062511408|5.0|De todos los libros que he leído en español o ingles, es lo mejor.  Es un libro fácil de leer y me encantó. Me di cuenta de que realmente no supiera lo que quisiera hacer.  Este libro me dio dirección y sé que tendré éxito  en la vida porque entiendo escuchar a mi corazón.<br />Of all the books I have  read in my life, el Alquimista is definately the best!  It makes you look  deep inside yourself and realize what you truly want.  Most people already  know, but they forget to listen to their heart.  READ THIS BOOK and you  will find inspiration you never thought possible.
B00004T8RK|1.0|Pearl Jam is a great band but this album fails to show this. The  production is terrible and the songs are weak. It is there worse release to  date.
0440219078|4.0|The book gave me a lot of feeling, and understandment.  I feel the book had a lot of meaning.  It was hard to understand at first.  The characters were great.  The setting of the book made me feel that their community was very weird.
B000001IPL|5.0|SMASH is the definition of the Offspring's music.  It has all of their qualities: Dexter's enraged and also very commited to whatever he is singing about voice, the things Noodles does with his strings that make the  songs sound great, the skilled and quick bass solos, and the super fast  energetic rythym by Ron Welty.  Time to Relax is not the funiest of the  Offsprings comic tracks, but Nitro is a VERY great song with lyrics so easy  to sing that, what do you know, you're singing with them.  Bad Habit is so  fun to listen to because of how entertaining Dexters voice can be when he  pretends to care soooo much about what hes singing about(&quot;but when Im  in my car...&quot;).  Gotta get Away gets a little more credit than it  should cause it is only mediocre, but is still something you would want to  listen to.  Genocide is awesome, I love the lyrics in Something to Believe  in, and Come OUt and Play - -- there's no surprise it was their  breakthrough single.  But if you ask yourself what it is that is so lovable  about it...you really don't know.  Self Esteem is becoming my favorite  Offspring song of all time  (along with All I Want).  It is funny and the  music is interesting, catchy and good. Itll be a Long Time has a great beat  and some meaningful lyrics.      boy Powerhead...well, if one of the  offspring members reads this, or if you know one, they should know that  they are way better off writing their own songs, because they're more  talented than the Didgits, or whatever.  Still, when they recorded that  they weren't very well known so it makes sense that they did a cover song.   What In the world happened to you...what in the world were they thinking,  more like.  So Alone is fast and cool.  Not the One is okay --- a good  chorus and a cool bass inro.  Smash is a VERY GOOD song as well.  The punk,  anti-trend energy in it makes you feel great.  So, I recommend buying this.   Smash and Ixnay are must haves for Offspring fans or punk fans.
B000005IU1|5.0|Amazing... One of the best records of all time. buy this and funhouse.. Quit your job, form a band and live your life.
0553210246|5.0|Thomas Hardy's books are somewhat difficult to read, but this book, set in an English market town, is well worth reading to obtain a picture of life in rural England during that time period along with a complex tale of an  ambitious man's rise and ultimate fall.  A man rising from the ranks of  farm laborers builds himself up to become a successful grain merchant and  leading citizen of the town.  Events of his past emerge to place a shadow  over his success, and his greed and some bad judgement lead to his ruin.  Like most of Hardy's books, it is a tragedy for the main character.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I'm rather pleased with how good this CD is, there are some real draggers on this CD that are oh so slow. But then there are some great ones like &quot;Stronger&quot; and &quot;What You See&quot;.<br />1. Oops!.. I did it  again - This is a pretty good song, the beats catchy and the lyrics are  pretty good. But it has talking and a reference to Titanic, gets two thumbs  down for that little bit. Before the talking it is wonderful though. A lot  like ...Baby One More Time.<br />2. Stronger - This is probably my favorite  song on the CD, it's got a catchy beat, no talking and some pretty cool  lyrics. I think that almost anyone can relate to this song in some way and  it's a lot like some of ABBA's stuff. Britney's voice sounds a bit weird at  times, but it's still a great song.<br />3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door - Eh,  this is an ok song. It's got a pretty nice beat but it's hard to hear what  Britney's saying at times. Not the best on the CD, but pretty good. No  talking for this song.<br />4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction - She kinda  butchered this song. It has talking and if you haven't heard the real song,  it'd probably be pretty good. Just a typical remake of a hit song.<br />5.  Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - This is a fairly good song, not much of  a beat but the lyrics are pretty nice. More ballady then the ones before.  Her voice sounds pretty good throughout the song.<br />6. What You See (Is  What You Get) - This has to be right up there with my favorite songs. It  has a great beat and pretty cool lyrics. No talking, which is an add plus.  Another one that I think most people would be able to relate to. Her voice  is perfect through this track.<br />7. Lucky - Eh, just another song. It's got  a fairly good beat and the chorus is kinda catchy but the 'story' it tells  is kind of stupid. <br />8. One Kiss From You - Another bubble-gum pop song.  Pretty boring, nothing new here. Hardly any beat, her voice sounds fairly  whiny.<br />9. Where Are You Now - Just like &quot;Kiss From You&quot;,  nothing new. I hardly ever listen to this song. Way too soft and her voice  sounds pretty whiny.<br />10. Can't Make You Love Me - This song has a great  beat, pretty good lyrics as well. Her voice sounds much better and while  it's the typical Britney song, it's pretty good. No talking, extra  bonus.<br />11. When Your Eyes Say It - We won't even talk about this song.  One word, boring.<br />12. Dear Diary - I also move to burn the diary. Nothing  new here, most boring and lame song on the track. Nothing happens on  it.<br />Most of the songs are listenable to, a basic Britney CD. The one  glitch I found is that all the talking except during &quot;Oops!...I Did It  Again&quot; the song, were placed at the end of the song before. The  talking that sets up &quot;Lucky&quot; is put on the end of &quot;What You  See&quot;, so if you're only listening to &quot;What You See&quot; it gets  boring listening to them talk. Besides for this, it's a pretty good CD. As  always, there are lyrics to only a few songs. Those songs being:  &quot;Oops!&quot;, &quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;Don't Let Me Be The  Last&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot; and &quot;Dear Diary&quot;.  I would  recommend if you enjoyed Britney's first CD to buy this one.
2070360024|4.0|The Stranger follows the &quot;adventures&quot; of Meaursault, a  French-Algerian, as he tries to make his way through the Universe in a life  he neither asked for, nor understands, but is doing his best to navigate.  The action is muted and secondary to the motivations and thoughts of  Meaursault and the revealing of Camus' philosophy.<br />If you haven't read  anything else by Camus, you probably had to read The Stranger in high  school. But now may be a good time to give it another chance.  The novel  falls into three parts, each marked by a death.  Straightforward and  simple, the novel presents its plot clearly enough, a good foil for the  philosophy of the author. Camus said of this book that it portrayed  &quot;the nakedness of man when faced with the absurd&quot; and every life  is absurd. Meaursault is not what you would expect as the hero of a novel;  he is just an everyday guy, perfect for the role, really, since his job is  to reveal the author's version of the truths that are universal, not  applicable only to a few. As an atheist, he has no preconceptions about his  life or the direction it should take and is at the &quot;mercy&quot; of the  world.<br />An Existentialist, Camus is not always a bundle of laughs to read,  but always has interesting commentary to make about the world and the  importance of accepting who you are and learning to deal with your true  strengths and weaknesses. It isn't saying you should be this or that, but  saying that you should just be. Don't concentrate on becoming some other  person's version of success, because, after all, we're all just going to  end up dead anyway. A kind of Existentialist carpe diem message for anyone  who has ever felt like a stranger, and that's probably everyone. As  Meaursault himself would say, &quot;the truth shall set you free.&quot; It  is a difficult read in some ways, but it will leave you changed.
630204135X|5.0|Simply one of the best Bergman's movies. It comes close to Autumn Sonata and his other pictures where he takes a very serious look into Mother's relationship with her children, and it is a very unconventional theme that  he seems to have a deep interest - how the mother does not love the child.  In short, a masterpiece.
0679735909|5.0|Possession, a Booker Prize winning novel, is an investigation via faery  tale imagery of the psyches of modern academics. The &quot;possession&quot;  referred to in the title could mean many things: the possession of love, of  work, of poetry and art, or a literal possession by the people and things  of the past. Like the title, this novel, set mostly in the present, works  on many levels. The main characters, Roland and Maud, are researching the  lives of two Victorian poets, R.H.Ash and Christobel LaMotte, respectively.  Roland and Maud find out that their poets were involved during their lives,  and the subsequent novel is part romance (in the old sense of the word),  part mystery, and part tragedy, all with a healthy dose of comedy. Byatt  integrates different genres in the novel, such as poem snippets and faery  tales, to enrich and enliven the text, drawing the reader into the past  with the characters.<br />I firmly believe that Byatt's personal experience  in Academia is telling here. She knows what it is like. Some people have  complained that the novel is very dense and is therefore rather slow  reading--but, oh, the payoff is superb. If you have plenty of time to  yourself to enjoy an intricate, but not overdone, novel, pick this one. It  isn't a light read, but it doesn't require a PhD in literature either. If  you read only one modern novel that isn't &quot;beach reading&quot; your  entire life, make it this one.
0440234743|5.0|The author of The Testament is John Grisham.  He is a lawyer, which explains why most of his books have to do with crime and punishment.  The Testament is no exception to the rule.  Greed and selfishness are the most  prevalent of the character traits in the book.  Tony Phelan, who is a  multi-billionaire, changes his last will and testament about as often as  most people change clothes.  In every will, he gives more to family members  who have not upset him recently, and he takes away from those who have  caused him grief.  Eventually, he lets out the news that he has a brain  tumor and is going to die.  He drafts a final will and signs it.  He is  pronounced to be sane by three distinguished psychiatrists.  However, after  he commits suicide, and the family reads his holographic will, which he  drafted on legal paper just minutes before he jumped, they all began to  question his sanity.  The story then takes a very surprising turn.   However, if you wish to find out what that exciting turn is, you will have  to read the book.
B00000JCOV|1.0|I hate to sound like a snob, but I cant seem to understand ROSS ROBINSON is getting so much good press these days. From a personal stand point, I can think of at least five better rock/metal producers other than  &quot;double R&quot;(Albini,Rock, Rubin and the ones jumping out at me). So  not being a fan of Robinson's flash/controversy/groove-style of producing,  needless to say I am NOT impressed by Slipknot's debut.<br /> Slipknot  basically is coming into a time of music where your time in the spotlight  is destined to be short and unmemorable and instead of doing something to  change this, they just add fuel to the fire. The riffy on this cd sounds  like old retreds of songs we heard from Korn, Soulfly,and Pantera we heard  from a long time ago. So that there adds nothing new to today's current  &quot;clone happy&quot; market. The lyrics(and vocalist,for that matter)  also adds nothing new to the current heavy scene. Soft at one point,  Pantera-like at another. The three drummers is just a little ecessive in my  opinion. And their most loathable charateristic? The turntables. Is it  really nessary to have &quot;scratching&quot; in rock music? Personally, I  think its almost become cliche`d.<br />So in the end, what are you left with?  Not much that you haven't already heard(and can do much better). However,  if this is the type of music you like, I highly recomend Machine Head(new  or old). I believe they are a much better choice. But then again, I could  just be being synical. The funny thing is; you'll never know ^_^.
6301773551|5.0|Star Wars was a HUGE success from the start, and will be known for years to come as the best movie of a series ever written. Never have I seen such an incredible video, with sequals that make you stare in awe at such a  stunning plout. Star Wars was orginially made by Lucas Arts in 1977, hoping  that the movie would be a success. and boy, did the movie do FAR more  better then that! Star Wars was a huge step in special affects, and a new  concept in the way movies are made. The movie starts exciting from the  start, and is always action-packed with their rarely being a minute where  the Empire and Rebellion aren't fighting over the rights of the planets.  For the rebellion, it is a war that means saving themselves and their  planets. To the Empire, it is just another small step to the thousands of  planets the Empire occupies. This movie explains Luke Skywalker's early  years of life, and his first steps to becoming a Jedi Knight. Although Star  Wars is not the best movie of the series, it is the foundation for the next  movies to come. Another thing that makes Star Wars somewhat fun to watch is  that it is played by actors who would adventually become famous. Star Wars  was only Harrison Ford's second major film, and he has come a long way  since then. This movie, as I have said before, is the BEST film ever made.
0792101448|5.0|It is the Best Western      Movie ever made.
630575067X|5.0|The Phantom Menace is deffinately the best movie I have ever seen! I have heard many people say that the Phantom Menace wasn't a good movie, and wasn't worth watching. However, I soon found out that was not the case  after watching the movie. The only reason people don't like the Phantom  Menace is because they aren't Star Wars fans! This is the best of the  series, and anybody who was impressed with the past three episdoes will  LOVE this movie! This episode gives you a clear picture of the story before  Luke's time, and will help you understand many of the questions that  arroused in the other three episodes. This movie also leaves you eager to  know what will happen in the next movie that is currently being filmed. The  special affects are absolutely incredible!  You can tell as time  progresses (and technology as well)that every movie gets better and better.  (both storyline and affects)Many parts of the movie just make you want to  say, &quot;Wow!&quot; over and over. Their is no telling how much time  George Lucas spent on scenes such as the Gungan city, the pod race, and the  lightsaber fight between the two Jedis and Darth Maul. Any Star Wars fan  will love this video. If you haven't yet seen it, then your missing a big  piece to the Star Wars trilogy. A superb video!
6305903182|4.0|Hello Sidney... Wes Craven is the mastermind behind the Scream series. He directs his films with great style which relates to the viewers' different moods. The original was greater than the sequel but the third has overtaken  the first. Although most of the jumps and scares have been seen before, it  still seems to scare you. The storyline is fantastic for a horror/thriller  film, very sophisticated but logical. Neve Cambell has done a terrific job  as Sidney Prescott, although it's hard to say the same for David Arquette.  The question that gets me thinking about the film is if Sidney is immortal  or not? Nothing seems to damage her, physically that is. The movie has a  decent duration and the actors are actually convincing in most cases. Wes  Craven has shown us what I think is his max and Courtney Cox does so  aswell. Scream 3 is definately worth purchasing, especially on the DVD  format. Push &quot;PLAY&quot; and turn up the volume because this one is  going to scare you! THE KILLER IS.....
0790729970|5.0|The story is of Stanley, a bank officer, a 'nice guy' who always finishes last. At the lowest point of his desperation, he gets hold of the Mask, and with it, he becomes the Norse god of mischief. It allows him to do what  ever he wanted to do with immunity. He finds an out let for his repressed  angers (against the Car mechanics) and desires (to be with Cameroon). But  the story takes a turn when the 'masked' Stanley runs up against some bank  robbers and beats them to the loot....<br />I bought the DVD 5 years after I  had first seen the movie at the theatre. I had a lot of fun watching it at  the theatre, but I felt that watching it on DVD was even better. The masked  version of Stanley (Jim Carrey) is almost cartoonish and brings out the  inner most desires of Stanley (whose version of a good evening was to watch  cartoons). The movie does bring out Carrey's best talents, and even more  amazing was his and Cameroon Diaz's dance (which was not their talent  before the movie). The part I love best is the 'Rumba beat' dance and when  Stanley's dog gets hold of the mask.<br />The DVD has the director's  commentary and some deleted scenes. The commentary does help in  appreciating the effort that went behind the scenes, and having the DVD  allows you to look scene by scene at the amazing amount of things that  happen to the Masked characters in a short period, you get to look at some  scenes carefully which you might have missed while watching it at a  theatre.<br />The director hinted at a possible sequel to the Mask and I am  still awaiting it! I am sure it's gonna be as 'Smokinn..' as this one.
B000002NE4|5.0|To me, this is an album about love and loss. Fear and rejection. And  wanting to see the things that you know you may never see again. A great  album to end the day with. Nick Cave leaves nothing to your imagination on  this album. I think that Cave is one of the best artists of our time. the  piano pieces are brilliant and his lyrics are disturbing and calming all at  the same time. A little different style for him but all the better for fans  with great taste and open minds. Enjoy.
B00003CWLE|5.0|Amazing is the SCOPE of this movie!  Amazing is the lack of interest by the award-givers!  Having spent some time in the Orient, I was thrilled by the filming and sets of the production . . . in fact, from the moment the  movie started and the music began, I was holding my breath!  I think Jodie  Foster has the &quot;stiff upper lip&quot; DOWN, and Chow Yun-Fat is the  best King yet . . . This movie takes you through the gauntlet of emotion;  you want to laugh, sing, cry, and kill the dirty rotton traitor Alak!   In  my opinion, this is the hallmark of a GREAT story, and a great movie.  My  husband agreed (after seeing it the first time) that this was one to own.   In fact, walking out of the theater there was - silence - until the lady in  front of me turned and said &quot;WOW!&quot;
0790729628|3.0|In classic detective shows the detective would narrate as the show went on. This is seen in many of the early detective shows, and can be felt in novels. Watching the directors cut left long silences and almost put me to  sleep, but the original version, with the detectives input from his  perspective, was enjoyable and kept me watching. I would never buy the  directors cut on DVD, but put the original one in print and I am there.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is the best CD i have ever listened too if you like rap music and even if you dont, you should buy this CD it has some of the phatest beats i have ever heard. Eminem has done it again.
0802133347|2.0|If you want a good Lawrence book, read Sons and Lovers or Women in Love instead. Lady Chatterly, although written later, is much more immature in terms of style than Lawrence's first book, sons and lovers.  The popularity  probally results from the scandal that surrounded the book and not the  writing or plot.  The book only has real importance in a sociological  reading, showing the social mores of the period it was written in.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I've got the new CD and i think its probably the greatest music I've ever heard him come out with!  The best song on the CD, in my opinion, is Kill  You, either that, or Criminal.  He doesn't seem to be afraid of anyone and  says exactly how he feels.  Definitly buy this one!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is just quite simply one of the best rap albums I have heard next to All Eyez On Me and Doggystyle. Em's style has really matured since his last album and is now very distinctive.  Lyrically the album is superb but the  delivery is also faultless.<br />Perhaps the ultimate compliment though is  that he outshines all of his guests on the album and, when you consider  that they include Dre, Snoop and Xzibit, that is not easy.<br />The tracks of  real distinction are The Real Slim Shady, Stan, Marshall Mathers, B-Please  2, and Under The Influence with the D-12, who also come off well.<br />All in  all, this is one of the albums of the year and no rap fan, or fan of good  music, should be without it.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album truly is all about Marshall Mathers, a/k/a Slim Shady. He said that this album &quot;pushes freedom of speech to the limit&quot; and push the limit it does. Upon listening to the tracks, such as &quot;Stan&quot;  and &quot;Kim&quot; you will hear horrible content. However, listeners  should realize that he's just joking and he uses the content because he  can. He is upset at being blamed for the Columbine murders, so in one of  his songs, he encourages kids to kill, but encourages them sarcastically,  repeating, &quot;Where were the parents?&quot; in the track &quot;Who  Knew?&quot; Once you go past all of the content, you are left with a rapper  who can flow with the best of them. He has a unique style of flowing and  rhyming. If you are mature enough to have a &quot;sick sense of humor&quot;  about the material in the songs, then the album is a must. Upon listening,  you will know how good Eminem really is.
B000003TAR|5.0|&quot;What else can I say...&quot; this is arguably thegreatest Nirvana CD out there!  A lot of people say it's Nevermind,and all the big, huge, Nirvana fans (like myself, even though I don't say this) will say, &quot;You are a poser, you only like the newer stuff and Bleach is the best!&quot; Well I'm not saying that Bleach isn't one of the best all time rock albums but In Utero is the album in which they had almost reached there maximum potential, even though nobody can ever say for sure what their maximum potential could be, because of Kurts contoversial death (I say death because I don't know if he killed himself or if he was murdered, but that is beside the point).  This whole record, from begining to end is a work of art.  It is perfect, everything from the artwork to the last note played on the guitar in All Appologies, is perfect.  Anyone who says that you should not get this album is crazy.  I have had this cd for almost 8 years now and I will never get tired of it.  I anxiously await he release of the box set.  I also highly, highly recommend you pick up all the rest of their cds as well! Nirvana is my favorite band and one of the greatest bands of all time, with the Beatles, etc.  Grunge Rock will live forever in all of our hearts!
B000002GJS|5.0|An excellent album with some very well constructed tracks such as 'I Thought I Died &amp; Gone To Heaven', and '(Everything I Do) I Do It For You. This album isn't one of the albums which has his best work, but some  of the tracks are very enjoyable to listen to such as 'All I want Is You'  The lyrics for (ETID)IDIFYM, are awesome and cannot be ignored. Some tracks  are a bit 'dingy' such as House Arrest, but overall, it is a very enjoyabLE  CD.<br />The theme songs to Robin Hood a major success as a ballad, and so was  I thought I Died &amp; Gone to Heaven.<br />So Far So Good, and Best Of Me are  better albums, but this one is just as good in terms of enjoyment.<br />Other  tracks which are great are 'can't stop this thing we started', and 'Depend  On Me'<br />A full 5 stars!
B00004T9UF|5.0|this is the best eminem cd i got it when it came out and it is the best of  all the eminem cd's i loved this cd because it is a whole new eminem his  last lp was great but this one is much better similar cd's you should get  if you like eminem are limp bizkit,korn,kid rock,dr.dre,and dmx.one thing  is for sure you will not waste your money on buying this cd!!!
0440213525|4.0|The Client, by John Grisham, is a fascinating story about an eleven year old child named Mark Sway.  When Mark is smoking behind his trailer, he notices a car with a hose leading from the exhaust pipe to the interior of  the car.  Mark tries to stop the man in the car from commiting suicide and  the man tells Mark a dangerous secret.  Soon Mark is being chased by the  Mafia and his brother is in traumatic shock.  Mark hires Reggee Love, a  lawer dedicated to helping poor children.  Mark starts to hate his life,  just wanting to be normal, until he comes up with a bold plan that might  just work with Reggees' help.    This book is very intense and hard to  put down.  I like how John Grisham writes the book.  The book hardly pauses  and every scene is action.  You don't want to stop reading.   John does not  write in a formal manner, the book is rather relaxed.  The main carachter  is very unusual.  Mark is only an 11 year old kid who compares everything  to movies.  The book is exciting and has some very interesting ideas.  The  court is interesting and even the judge is different than normal judges.   Judge Harry has odd ideas and likes things to go as quickly as possible.   He does not even want the lawers to stand up when talking.  Harry beleives  every one deserves their own room and his court stenographer is gorgeous.   This is diferent than most of his books and most other law and action  books.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes Grishams' books or  mystery/action type books.

B0000025RI|4.0|Michael Jackson has had such, um, 'negative media coverage' (you know, 'Wacko Jacko' and all that) in the last few years that it's extremely easy to forget that he used to produce some very fine music!<br />'Beat it',  'Thriller' and 'Billie Jean' stick around in everyone's memory, but some of  the other songs here are cool... 'Wanna be startin' something' and 'Human  nature' are standouts.  Probably the best bit is Vincent Price's intro to  'Thriller' - acutally credited in the sleeve notes as 'Rap by Vincent  Price'!  But maybe 'PYT' is better forgotten.
B00003CXDU|5.0|You'll cheer for the good guys and hiss at the bad guys.  You'll laugh at the funny parts and cry during the sad parts.  By the time you finish watching, you'll have a  warm, fuzzy feeling all over.  This is a movie  that's definitely worth many repeated viewings.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This third album by The Clash, originally released in the US in 1980, was voted Best Album of the 80's by Rolling Stone readers.  It's easy to see why, though it's hard to think of it as a 80's album, since it actually  came out in England in 1979.<br />'London Calling' was a double album - and it  justified that format, being full of such strong material.  Reggae, country  and rock'n'roll influences can all be found - proving that, unlike many of  their punk counterparts, The Clash were musically open-minded and ready to  integrate new styles into their music.<br />This also contains what is  possibly the first 'secret track' on vinyl - 'Train in Vain', which wasn't  listed on the original LP sleeve.
B00004T9UF|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST CD EVER!    I just love all the songs on it!  It's soooo great!    The Real Slim Shady and Marshall Mathers are the best songs on the cd!
6300183971|4.0|I first saw Dune when I was eleven years old, and it totally weirded me out (I'd read the excellent Frank Herbert novel plus four of its sequels, but I hadn't seen anything else by David Lynch).  Unsurprisingly (given the  length of the original book) the story is truncated here, with the result  that the Fremen lose some of their mysticism and we don't get a impression  of the great leader Muad'Dib becomes.  But all the essential elements are  here: the spice Melange, the worms, the glowing blue eyes and the  Harkonnen-Atreides feud.  I want to get this on DVD so I can put it into  context with the rest of Lynch's work, though these days it's hard for me  to visualise Kyle Maclachlan playing anyone other than Twin Peaks' Special  Agent Dale Cooper!
0375707972|4.0|This book is not meant to distract us with stylish prose, but to listen to a man, not an artist, describe an event that happened to him in childhood and how that event affected his life. Therefore, do not expect flashy  &quot;literary&quot; devices other than plain-spoken narrative. This is not  an easy style to emmulate. The telling of the story is the stronger for  it.<br />This is a take on the Holocaust, and it is a take on sexual awakening  in a young boy who has an affair with an older woman. Later, the young boy  learns to take disappointment, pain, and a growing awareness of what it  means to love and to extend kindness even to someone whom you feel has hurt  you irreparably. To look at this book as some kind of non-literary event  and therefore worthy of scorn is to completely miss the point. This book  really must be read without a lot of pre-judgement of what a book should  sound like, and of what a book should be telling the reader. The book has  its own point of view, and exposes that point of view to us slowly and  evenly, without uneccesary drama. To me, this makes it all the more  compelling. It sounds utterly real. The writer has taken the chance that  some readers won't get it, and, indeed, some have not. More's the pity.<br />EKW
B000002BSV|5.0|A fantastic return to form from a fantastic band!  With this album, Suede proved all their detractors wrong and simply blew away the critics by producing ten of the best rock/pop tracks for years.  The singles from the  album speak for themselves - the glorious, dewy-eyed 'Trash', the  melancholy 'Saturday Night', the glam-tastic 'Film Star' and the utterly  unmatched 'Beautiful Ones' - with tracks like these, the album almost  sounds like a Best Of.  <br />Lyrically, Brett reaches a peak here,  culminating in the superb poetry of 'Beautiful Ones' ('cracked up, stacked  up, twenty-two, psycho for sex and glue, lost it to Bostik') in which all  the images and ideas of the last two albums are perfectly sharpened and  distilled.<br />Coming Up also showcases the musical ability of  nineteen-year-old Richard Oakes, who coolly brushes aside the guitar-hero  posturing of Bernard Butler to bring about a tighter, pared-down sound  focusing on songs rather than solos and injecting the band with a new  energy.<br />Never has a band faced such adversity and bounced back so  convincingly. Suede are heroes.
6304169558|5.0|From the director of &quot;Speed&quot; comes another fast-pased adventure... but this time it's a force of nature... and a deadly one.  Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton star as tornado chasers in Tornado Alley, who  attempt to research deadly F5 twisters with a special research device,  &quot;The Dorothy II&quot;.  But when mother nature takes her course, and  things start to get out of hand, Paxton and Hunt's characters join forces  to escape Earth's deadliest natural force.  Directed by Jan De Bont.  A  good movie to see, and I can guarantee you'll love it.
0440214041|4.0|An attractive woman (as usual), in this case a law student, come up with her own theory of the murder of two supreme court judges. And it happened to be the truth; the biggest truth ever told and to be exposed after  Watergate.  <br />By now, you should be able to guess what would happened  next. The bad guys got the info, the chase began, almost everybody died but  she's the heroine and heroine seldom dies. However, a skillful Mr. Grisham  had made her not only lucky to be alive, she has every reason to continuing  being so. There's where the fun begins and there's also when another good  guy come in and together the made the difference.      <br />The story looked  simple isn't it? Fortunately, it's not. The plot was well planned, the  style is distinctive and the story, as i said it, very eventful and  convincing. No flaws as far as i could tell. READ IT. It's not a MUST READ,  but READ IT and Grisham could easily fits as your favourite writer,  especially if you are a first time reader of his book. <br />One thing though,  do not compare this book with the film. It's totally 2 different thing and  the latter does not do any justice AT ALL to the former.
0783225849|5.0|I can't write a review of Psycho without including some SPOILERS - so if you don't know the plot, don't read this review!  <br />'Psycho' is great cinema, from the word 'Go'.  Hitchcock constructs a standard scenario  (bored female employee succumbs to temptation and steals a large sum of  money from her boss, then flees town to start a new life elsewhere), and  then knocks the audience for six by having the female star (Janet Leigh as  Marion Crane) stabbed to death in the shower.  When Marion is murdered, the  initial plotline is revealed as a red herring and the real story begins -  the investigation into who's doing the killing at the Bates Motel.   <br />There are so many moments of greatness in this film: the notorious  shower scene, many scenes of suspense in the house on the hill  (incidentally based on the Edward Hopper painting 'House by the Railroad')  and - scariest of all - the swinging-lightbulb scene where Norman's mother  is finally revealed in her desiccated glory.  Wonderful cinema - better  than any sequel or remake.<br />[DVD comment: the packaging for this title  isn't great, but you shouldn't judge a DVD by its cover!]
0395645662|5.0|The Giver is a wonderful book for ages 10 to about14. This book has such a great plot for midage children. The plot and setting and whole book is so wonderful for mid age children.

6302794331|4.0|This great video is an exception to the general rule that latterday Muppets films are not very good (c.f. Muppets Treasure Island, Muppets in Space, etc).  Michael Caine is wonderful as nasty Scrooge (he should have  got an Oscar nomination for his cheesy London accent in this, rather than  for his cheesy American accent in The Cider House Rules).  All the standard  Muppet favorites are here, and Rizzo the Rat is particularly fine in this  film.  Very funny.
0684867621|1.0|This short (224 pages) novel begs the question, WHY?  Why wasit written, published and sold to the public. It's about a girl whogets lost in the woods and listens to Red Sox baseball games to get her through her ordeal...THAT'S IT! A short story at best! Some King *scholars* will no doubt talk about the piece as being about survival, etc.  I found it to be a quick read with no redeeming rewards.  Just a cash cow. That being said, I love King's work.  But this novel and his short story, &quot;L.T.'s Theory of Pets&quot; have just been worthless slices of the King pie. Not recommended to even your worst enemy.
6301562143|5.0|The 'Batman' movie woke me up to the talent of Tim Burton - I'd (unfairly) dismissed 'Beetlejuice' as a cheesy horror-comedy, but when this film came along I really started paying attention and I've since become a huge fan  (though 'Batman' was recently surpassed for me by 'Sleepy Hollow').  Burton  has created a dark and vivid version of Gotham City, with soaring gothic  churches and dark, foreboding backstreets.  Keaton serves as a fine Batman,  but he's better in his guise as Bruce Wayne.  And Jack Nicholson is a  wonderfully malevolent villain, though I prefer my Jokers a little leaner  (see Cesar Romero in the original whakkk-bammm-thwappp Batman movie).  The  story centres on the Batman-Joker dynamic explored in so many Batman  comics, and the retelling of the Joker's origin is (to my mind) very  similar to Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's excellent graphic novel 'The  Killing Joke'.  The best of the Batman movies, by far.
B000023X9W|5.0|This cd rocks!  Young goes acoustic and brings out the lyrics!   A bunch of touching songs that make you nostalgic but also makes you think of the future.  Brilliant stuff!
6303257844|5.0|'Speed' is a great movide - it effectively launched Keanu Reeves' action career and paved the way for roles such as Neo in the Matrix.  As such, our drawling newly-short-haired hero eschews complex dialogue and instead  dashes around trying to save Sandra Bullock and assorted innocent  bystanders from the terrorism inflicted upon their city by Dennis Hopper.   The centrepiece of the film is the excellent  bus-that-will-explode-if-it-slows-down scenario, but there are a number of  other cool set-pieces too, involving trains, elevators, bombs and much  accompanying smoke and sparks.  The sequel (without Mr Reeves) wasn't  really up to much by comparison, but this original film by Jan de Bont is a  prime example of successful rollercoaster cinema.
B00004S8Q9|5.0|This CD is the best of the three.  In a more loose jammy vide like VOODOO HIGHWAY.  Gillen's a monster on this cd, and Jake E Lee is a god!   A great cd that is a must have for Gillen's performance if nothing else!   RIP RAy  GILLEN
B000002V1D|5.0|The Wedding Album is superb!  It moves more toward '90's grooves and synthesizers while maintaining the Duran Duran style. The best and most listenable tracks are &quot;Too Much Info&quot;, &quot;None of the  Above&quot;, &quot;Come Undone&quot;, the best song and most inspiring song  &quot;Ordinary World&quot;, and &quot;UMF&quot; takes you in with it's  funky beats. I also enjoyed &quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot; for its  humurous criticizing of dishonest corporate figures and their tactics(  kinda like &quot;Too Much Info&quot; does). Buy this cd..even if you're not  a Duran fan. It rocks !
B00004SCX6|1.0|A Wasted rehash of Baby one more time, The video is Terrible, Yes Britney is beautiful, but her album is a waste of time &amp; money, if you like Britney Spears, go buy it, but it's pretty lame.
B000003S09|5.0|I first heard this album as a freshman in college in 1974.  I had never heard anything like it and was mesmerized by the ethereal lyrics and the innovative use of sound as texture.  My living group had an excellent  stereo (for the time) with huge speakers setup in a large common room.  I  spent many nights in a darkened room with this album playing real loud.   Twenty years later it took me a year to find this CD.  I guess the .com  revolution has made that job easier.  Twenty years has just made this album  sound that much better.  I Talk to the Wind, Epitaph and The Court of the  King Crimson are Great songs.  They have atmosphere and soul and although  their view of mankind may be bleak... at least there is a point to be made.   The Church is the only group since King Crimson that can invoke in me the  same dreamlike state.  This album epitomizes the innovation in music that  was taking place in the late sixties. I was surprised to see so many  reviews for this album.  There is hope.
B00000295Y|5.0|&quot;Inhale, Exhale, Just got an ounce in the mail...&quot;.  This is Cypress Hill's masterpiece, every track is strong and they are rapping  about what they know best, weed.  You can't fade this CD, it was released  in 93 and is still in heavy rotation in my cd collection.  If you like  Cypress Hill you can't afford not to own this album.
B0000027RL|5.0|The in your face style of music with out using over distorted guitars and constant screaming is wounderful.  The great differences in the emotional ride of RELEASE and ALIVE are great, but both songs along with others are  highly effective. This is a hard rock album that sold 10 million and still  has songs played from it on the radio today.  This is a highly influental  and one of the best of the 90's.  Nirvana started something new, but Pearl  Jam added more dementions to the grunge rock explosion .  Eddie vedder's  voice is full of emotion and completly unique, Stone Gossard's great song  writing on EVEN FLOW, ALIVE, and BLACK were all succesful radio singles.   Jeff Ament wrote the music to a song called JEREMY.  When combined with  Eddie's vocals became a radio favorite and Pearl Jam classic.  Mike  Mecready's solos espesially on ALIVE(rated 44 of all time according to  Guitar World reader's poll) are brilliant. A must have if you enjoy any  rock.  They set 90's standard of grunge-rock that evoved into style of  dress(flannel) and influence on every day life.  A piece of music history.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD is pretty cool.  All of the songs are good, but you should buy  this album because it has  arguably the best song out right now: &quot;The  Real Slim Shady.&quot; For Eminem fans, this is a great addition to your  collection.  I highly recommend this album by the one and only Eminem!

B00004RIV4|5.0|This is nothing like &quot;Sing It Back&quot;.  You're warned.  This album is really eclectic.  There are some rock and folk-like thingies, trip hop and drum-'n'-bass, and of course some nice dance-pop.  &quot;Remain The  Same&quot; is really fantastic, and track # 16 is really strange - but fun.   And we can also say thank U for the &quot;Sing It Back&quot;-remix.   Roisin Murphy has a nice voice - really childlike, a little bit like the  Cardigans-singer.  You can hear they've been having fun with this record,  well, I also had a lot of fun listening to it.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I really found Britney's first album, Baby One More Time, to be very fun to listen to. In Oops I Did It Again, Britney returns her energy and enthusiasm into 12 new songs. For once I finally found a CD in which I like  every song. Some I like more than others (my favorites are 1, 2, 5, 6, 10,  11, and 12) but those others should not be scorned upon.<br />If there's one  thing I feel is missing, it is a song that matches my all time favorite,  Sometimes. On the other hand, it might just show that Sometimes was such an  excellent song that it just could not be matched.<br />One of the most notable  songs in the CD is the last one, Dear Diary. This is the first song that  Britney has ever written herself, and will not be her last. In the  beginning, it sounds like a Mariah Carey song, but after listening to the  whole thing, Britney's true potential is shown. I also feel that this song  could also be made into a great music video with story involved, similar to  From the Bottom of My Broken Heart (which I think is one of the best music  videos I have ever seen).<br />If you like Britney Spears, then you should get  this album immediately. If you don't, then you should actually listen to  her songs and forget about the silly rumors you may have heard before  solidifying your opinion about her. Otherwise, you have no idea what you're  missing.
6304083769|5.0|The two biggest Japanise animation titles today for me would be Ghost in the Shell and Ninja Scroll.  Ghost in the Shell is very unusuall work, it is much deeper and thought-provoking than most of the titles you can find  on the shelf.  I also personally believe that the subject matter of Ghost  in the Shell is very accurate interpretation of what future will look like.   I am very sure that technology will reach a peak where it will be able to  blend human species and machines into one being.  I think that evidence of  the progress can be seen in all of the complex robots and synthetic organs  that scientists are working on these days.  <br />      Anyway, I greatly  enjoyed watching the story unfold with all of its twists and turns. The  plot was great and phylosophical conversations between characters were  touching.  The only drawback of Ghost in the Shell would be in its end. The  story did not reach its climax and left it as a loose end almost like in  Ninja Scroll.  On the other hand, life is a loose end. These kind of  endings make us think more about what we just saw.      <br />       To sum  up, I greatly encorage everyone to see this movie along with Ninja Scroll.   If you also happen to be sci-fi or action fan you are surely going to be  delighted!
B00004T9UF|5.0|I just bought Eminem's Marshall Mathers CD.  This is by far better then his first CD, even though that was tight.  I've only got to listen to the first 11 songs, but all of them have been great.  This album proves why  Eminem is the best all around rap artist out there.  He puts ICP to shame.
B00004SU5J|5.0|Hat's off to all concerned for producing such a fresh and invigarating album. Nice mixture of funky dance/ chilled jazz, combining new electrica sounds with a touch of a more conventional beat. Role on SUMMER!
B00000IBRX|5.0|This has got to be one of the best films ever made!  It did not get enough recognition at the academy awards, in my opinion. Robin Williams is fantastic in the role of a person getting used to the idea that his dead.  It is also a wonderful love story that shows what one will do for his  soulmate. The end may seem a little bit like a sell out, but that's because  they had to cut about 2 minutes from it, which changes the meaning a lot  (The Abyss syndrome, in other words). Cuba is fantastic; I would have given  anything to see him win another Oscar. The effects  are...well...Geez...words cannot describe the effects. You'll have to see  them yourself. The soundtrack is fenomenal as well. This movie is a must  for everyone.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I hated the first album by Eminem.  The beats were absolutely horrible.  The only good songs were produced by Dre.  On this album there are a lot of tracks produced by Dre.  The lyrics have always been on point, but the  beats make those lyrics shine on this album unlike the first one.
0694013889|2.0|This book is based on a wonderful idea, but there are some fundamental issues. What would prompt the author to name the little girl Prudence? The text is also awkward and too long in places - my daughter is turning the pages before we finish reading it. Also, the illustrations are still circa-1970 - both graphically and in color choice. My daughter thinks the potty is a big cup, which seems to confuse her more than it helps. I was potty trained in 1972 and even back then my potty chair looked like a potty chair, not a giant coffee cup. <br />I hope that Frankel will consider updating the key elements of this book to appeal to the modern toddler, though I know the book isn't that old.<br />And obviously, I am aware that the book was written in the '70s and it is up to me as a parent to help my child learn how to use a potty. My point is that the book would be even better if the problems I pointed out were corrected. We used this book, and an even better one - The Princess and the Potty - which I would recommend over this one for anyone training a daughter.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I guess Britney figured to stick with what she thought was a winning formula.  After all, Baby One More Time sold 12 million copies, so why not  record another album just like it?  Oops!..I Did It Again is essentially a  continuation of her first album.<br />This, of course, means her sound has not  evolved whatsoever.  Throughout the album, each song has roughly the same  beat.  Britney could probably dance the same routine while performing to  each song and not miss a beat.  Maybe she could take a lesson from the rest  of the music industry and learn to alternate harder rocking songs with the  softer ballads.  Her lyrics aren't exactly gold either, but what can an  audience really expect from an 18 year old girl?<br />Perhaps the biggest  &quot;Oops&quot; on the album was Britney's version of the Rolling Stones'  Satisfaction.  This may be the worst cover of the best song in rock and  roll history.  First, Britney has cut Keith Richards's famous guitar riffs,  which really is the heart and soul of the song.  Secondly, her mellow  vocals and milder lyrics (she changed the second verse and eliminated the  third) are weak compared to Mick Jagger's.  And lastly, the synthesizer and  slow drum beat add a cheesy flavor, ruining the song.<br />Britney still needs  to prove she has talent, because this album offers nothing you can't find  on Baby One More Time.  My advice to you is to save your money until  Britney achieves a more sophisticated sound, when or if that ever happens.
6302878527|1.0|I love Audrey Hepburn [love kate too]always have, always will. I remember not caring for Albert Finney's performance in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; The 1951 Alistair Sim version is my favorite there. I thought his work in  &quot;Simpatico&quot; and &quot;Erin Brokovich&quot; was superb. This said  brings us to &quot;Two for the Road&quot;. It is so bad that I find it  impossible to say anything good about it, and I wish I had never seen it.
B00001PE4D|5.0|This is a great teen films.Sarah Michelle Gellar is fantasic as Kathreen. Ryan Phillipe is a little less convincing. Reese Witherspoon is also fantasic as the Virgin Annete .

B00004RHZU|5.0|Okay, well, maybe this album wouldn't appeal to all people. But, if you're a fan of up tempo r&amp;b and Timberland-style beats, you'll love this CD. There are only two slow songs, which is really rare for and r&amp;b/soul  singer. Pink has a terrific voice and I commend her for her honesty in her  songs. Yes, she actually does write her own material! Here are the tracks:  1.SPLIT PERSONALITY: A very strong opening. The chorus is so cool and  different and Pink's &quot;split personality&quot; mouthing off in the  background is hilarious. 2.HELL WIT YA: A more typical r&amp;b song, but,  it is higlighted by Pink's wonderful lyrics (she says wench! ) and her  terrific delivery of them. Her delivery on this whole album is mucho bueno.  3.MOST GIRLS: This song benefits from over the top production (there are  opera singers) and the strength of the melody. It's very, very cool. One of  the better tracks. 4.THERE YOU GO: Of course, if you've heard this song,  you know about the singing/rap aspect of it and hopefully, you love it.  However, if you don't like this song don't buy the album cause it's just  like all the other songs practically. 5.YOU MAKE ME SICK: This song has a  really cool chorus with really cool lyrics. The verses are kinda weird and  pretty fast. 6.LET ME LET YOU KNOW: Another outstanding song. The first  ballad on the album, you will fall in love with this song after repeat  listens, guaranteed. 7.LOVE IS SUCH A CRAZY THING: This song would not be  half as good if it didn't have the awesome piano opening and the really  crazy beats. It's kinda a weird song. 8.PRIVATE SHOW: A standard Destiny's  Child/TLC uptempo song. It has cool lyrics though. 9.CAN'T TAKE ME HOME:  This is a completely awesome song! It's probably my favorite. It has the  fastest, angriest beats ever. She scares me on this one. 10.STOP FALLING:  the second and last ballad, and also the slowest. The first time I listened  to this one I didn't like it at all. But, after repeat listens Ifell in  love with it. It is such a sad, good song. And so suddle too. 11.DO WHAT U  DO: Kinda reminds me of Vitamin C! It's a very good, kinda campy, self  empowerment song. It's pretty good though. 12.HICCUP: This is a really cool  song. In the chorus it sounds like she's hiccuping which gives the song a  really cool affect. Very addicting chorus. 13.IS IT LOVE: This is a nice,  suddle, mid-tempo song. It's got a real cool beat that reminds me of Dr.  Dre for some reason. It's a good ending song.     ~ no lyrics included.
6303617719|5.0|Wonderful romantic comedy.  A must see for you people who enjoy a good love story with a few laughs thrown in.<br />When Kate (Meg Ryan) receives a call from her fiance in France, he tells her he's met another woman and  that they're over.<br />Determined not to lose the 'love of her life' she sets  off for Paris to win him back.

The two leads are  excellent and the chemistry between them is fantastic.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This cd is one of the best; EMiNEM disses everyone and he is a true rapper!
006016848X|2.0|Ho hum. This book is highly overrated in my opinion. Tell me something I didn't already know. THE ROMANTIC'S GUIDE and DONT SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF IN LOVE are far more insightful and useful.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This has got to be one of the dopest albums in recent years! I bought it  on the day of release in the UK, and it is one of the best albums I have  heard. Eminem comes stronger than ever: just check the tracks about his  obssessive fan, 'Stan', if you don't believe me! It's as funny, if not  funnier, in places, than 'Slim Shady LP', and to keep you Dre heads happy,  features RBX, Dre, X to the Z Xzibit, Snoop, Nate and even ex Onyx member  Sticky Fingaz. Buy this album!
B000001Y2U|5.0|Despite the Attitude, Look or Image of Marylin Manson, everyone that thinks his music is cheap rubbish and he has no talent at all should give  his records a very close listening. Maybe he is a Posing Jerk or maybe not,  his music deserves a high rank at Rock Musics Hall of Fame.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Having picked up the album on the day of release in England, this is dope! It's a lot better than his first album: don't believe me, check out the album's masterpiece 'Stan' about his obsessive fan! It's, in places, as  funny, if not funnier than the 'Slim Shady LP', and will even fulfill you  Dre heads with guests including RBX, Dre, X to the Z, Snoop, Nate and  Sticky Fingaz, and D-12's own Bizarre. Basically, pick this up, it's hotter  than hell!
B000002J2B|4.0|Genesis here combines their brand of progressive rock with a less quirky, more melodic style.  These are songs you can sing along to, unlike many of their early albums.
0446525537|5.0|Ladies and Gentlemen - let's get ready to cry!  - This was by far the saddes of his books.  If you have read either of the other two you should really enjoy this book.  Any further details might give away the book.  Be  forewarned - keep tissues close at hand !
0767849493|4.0|Anyone who thinks this is a serious attack on religion missed the point.  It is a clever, funny and insightful look at faith.  My neighbor thought it  was weird and couldn't follow it, so if car chases are your thing avoid  this.  The casting was brilliant.  The last Scion works at an abortion  clinic. Cardinal Glick is George Carlin.  God is Alanis Morrisette !!!  It  is just witty and pokes some fun at religion but is is not offensive.  The  directing is a bit scattered and confusing so view each scene individually,  but strap on your sense of humor before
0783225970|3.0|Looked at purely as an improvement on the lousy VHS version in circulation 'til now, this DVD at last allows us to see Brian De Palma's Scarface as he perhaps intended us to see it.  And what a glorious mess it is!  Al Pacino  is mesmerizing as Tony Montana, the petty Cuban thug who claws his way to  the top of an ignominious dunghill, only to be shot off by another thug,  this time from Colombia.  I suppose if you're sick of the glorification of  Italian mafioso in The Sopranos, you'll be heartened by [Italian] De  Palma's switch to Hispanic thugs.  But this is Pacino's movie, and he takes  it by the throat from his first scene.  De Palma sets up several of his  trademark sequences, using crane shots and long takes to best effect  (Carlito's Way is a distant second to Scarface), which is a fancy way of  saying he telegraphs the violent scenes rather blatantly.  You can see it  all coming a mile away.  A Grand Guignol bloodbath ends the film, in the  glorious tradition of Sam Peckinpah.  A nasty, brutish, but not short film  - Scarface will probably find a wider, younger audience in this immaculate  digital (widescreen) transfer.  (At last, we can see what happened to the  guys with the chainsaw in the bathtub!)
0440224764|4.0|This isn't Grisham's best, but still a great book.  If legal thillers are  your thing then you won't be disapointed with this one.  Its an intresting  book in that it almost works backwards.  The beginning of the book is like  the climax and the rest of the book reveals the previous events.  To a  certain extent.  Read the book and you will see what I mean.
6305041156|5.0|Made at - for Japan - a staggering cost in 1985, Kurosawa's &quot;Ran&quot; comes closest to catching the director's decidedly black mood at the time (considering the derisive response in Japan to Dodeskaden  [inspiring an attempted suicide], the grudging acceptance of Dersu Uzala,  which had to be made in the Soviet Union if at all, and the passive  response to Kagemusha - the Japanese critics' usual treatment of anyone so  rash as to look for financing outside Japan [see Oshima's In the Realm of  the Senses]), &quot;Ran&quot; was another of Kurosawa's long-cherished  projects.  That it made it to the screen relatively intact (Kurosawa even  forced the otherwise independent composer Toru Takemitsu to accept his  temperature-gauge and compose a pseudo-Mahlerian score) is one of those  miracles of international film-production that arrives maybe once in a  generation.  That Kurosawa took Shakespeare's cue and painted a picture of  medieval Japan (read: the modern world) that is uncompromisingly dark and  pessimistic is perhaps not entirely surprising.  The film feels like a last  testament, even if Kurosawa would go on to make three more  uncharacteristically tired films - Dreams, Rhapsody in August and Madadayo  [Not Yet].  The darkest testimonial from a grizzled filmmaker at the height  of his powers, &quot;Ran&quot; is indispensable to any serious study of  Kurosawa's oeuvre.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Its no suprise......getting past the sophmore jinx ay be difficult for an average artist....but then Eminem Isnt Anything Like an average artist. With Outstanding Lyrics.Beats (Complements Of DR.Dre On 7 Songs) Eminem Has  Out-shined nearly every other MC this year so far(With the exception of a  few....)without selling out in any way. Probably not the best cd to play  with your grandpa but then thats one of the things that makes eminems music  so memorable..his fearlessness of saying what he really thinks at any  time.in any place......a sure classic to go up there in the ranks of Dre's  Chronic 2001 , Meathod Man And Readman's Blackout , and Even The Original  Chronic As Some Of The Greatest rap cd's Of Its Time.
B00004T9UF|4.0|&quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; is a stellar stand alone album and it is a more than impressive follow-up to &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; (which I thought was a classic)...In his first CD Eminem rapped about his life  before he made his first album...in this album he talks about life since  his first album...<br />This album is full of the unbelievable lyrical  twisting and word arrangement that has become synonymous with Eminem...(You  become so used to hearing his awesome flow that you almost forget how hard  it is to give you verse after verse of hot lyrics)...If you are a true  hip-hop fan you will love this album...(like Rah Digga said &quot;Checkin  for the rhymes not checkin for the track&quot;)...Pick any song and you  will find more hot lyrics than you would find on the entire album of some  of today's &quot;hottest&quot; rappers...don't get me wrong though...the  tracks are hot too...<br />The only place where the album lacks is in the  guest appearances...None of the guests on the album can touch Eminem in  lyrical skills so they actually sound really wack next to him...(except  track 15...Dre, Snoop and Xzibit hold their own)...<br />If you are familiar  with Eminem, the album will not shock you as much as &quot;The Slim Shady  LP&quot;...which is good...he has already made it known that he will say  anythihg...any further attempt to prove that would be ridiculous...<br />If  you didn't like the last album...or what Eminem has put out since...you  won't like this album...This album is full of the same themes, tones and  content of his previous work...but if you loved what Eminem has put out  before...you will definately love this...
6300216268|4.0|OK, the characters other than Harold and Maude (Harold's mother and uncle, the priest, the psychotherapist) are a bit two-dimensional, Maude isn't consistent with her own beliefs, and the ending is, uh, ambiguous, but this is truly a great movie. It abounds with messages - surprisingly uplifting messages, given its plot - but it doesn't hit the viewer over the head with them.<br />The photography of the San Francisco peninsula is stunning, Cat Stevens's music is great, and there are dozens of scenes that had me laughing until the tears came - while wondering whether somebody had just stuck a knife in my gut.<br />Funny, sad, hopeful - with all its faults, a great movie. Everybody should see it at least once.<br />I don't have a television; therefore, I don't own a VCR, but I own this videotape.
0783117388|2.0|Sex and the City is Darren Star's attempt at a raunchier, more sexually explicit Melrose Place--and he fails miserably. The most interesting character is Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and that's not saying much. She  gives us a look into the convoluted relationship problems of herself and  her three friends. These supposed liberated women for the late '90s have  nothing better to do than talk about how they can't find a man and how all  men are the same. Mr. Big (Chris Noth)and his realtonship with Carrie is an  interesting focus of the show, but unfortunately it's not enough. This  &quot;sexy adult comedy&quot; leaves much to be desired.
B000001FXV|5.0|The first of marley's live sets this one has the energy and emotion to stand the test of time. The CD starts out with a classic &quot;trenchtown rock&quot; and the fun really begins after that. &quot;Burnin and  looting&quot; is followed by&quot;them belley full&quot; and &quot;lively  up yourself&quot;. My favorite reggae CD!<br />.............socks
0805062971|5.0|I may be &quot;out of line&quot; here but to be truthful I'm not all that concerned.  Those of us that have read &quot;Fight Club,&quot; and especially those of us that love &quot;Fight Club&quot; have one thing in  common, we often feel like those men mentioned in &quot;Fight Club.&quot;    The book deals with underground boxing matches that lead the participants,  mainly a group of disgruntled and unsatisfied young men, into a life of  servitude at the hands of an insane, yet strangely sensible, character  named Tyler Durden. Now don't get me wrong, I don't advocate the methods of  attention that the book mentions, but there is definitely something  grabbing and satisfying about the way these characters deal with an  increasingly commercialistic and selfish society.  I don't think there's a  person out there who doesn't from time to time wonder if we would be better  off if credit cards had never been invented or mass media was less  concerned with the sensational. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is about more than a  group of militant crusaders out to change the world, it's a parable if you  will, something to be read and discussed and deciphered how you see fit.   Yes, some who read it could say it's nothing more than a tale of men gone  bad, but there's also those of us that see an appropriateness in the  characters increasing desperation at the loss of their individuality to  corporations and brand names. Don't miss this book.  It has some important  things to teach and it does an amazingly effective and entertaining job at  doing just that.  It's a definite must have.
B000023X9W|5.0|This is wonderful.  This album has nothing to do with either of the &quot;Harvest&quot; albums (just slick P.R.) nor &quot;Comes A Time&quot;.  Rather it harkens back to Side 2 of &quot;On The Beach&quot;, and Side 1 of  &quot;Hawks and Doves&quot; (shamefully underrated album).  For  longstanding Neil Young fans who love those albums, they know what I mean.   How a guy in his 50's can put out a work that is so damn good and honest is  a miracle.  I can't tell you my favorite songs because it changes every  time I play the disc, which is a LOT.  (OK, &quot;Buffalo Springield  Again&quot; is kinda throwaway, but it's a fun throwaway).  <br />This is the  best disc I have bought in years, honest truth.  I will admit that I lap up  everything Neil Young touches, but this is truly superior.  Bravo!
0380804557|5.0|I'd never heard of Neil Gaiman.  I picked up the book in the grocery store because I had read and reread all my Orson Scott Card books, and needed something new.  This book absolutely blew me away.  What a fabulous story!  As soon as I finished it, I ran out and bought NEVERWHERE -- ALSO  EXCELLENT!  I am now a HUGE Neil Gaiman fan.  I love his style of writing.  This is truly a wonderful book!
0553573403|5.0|After rereading Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time saga for the third or fourth time I was ready for a new world. I was looking for something new and refreshing and I found it by taking a chance on a name relatively unknown  within this genre.  The gleaming silver sheen of the hardcover jacket  caught my eye while walking around my local book retailer. One page into it  I knew I had found something special. Martin's writing is to modern fiction  what Paul McCartney is to songwriting. Each sentence leads you to the next  with such fluidity that you forget that you're reading a book.  If you're  ready for a refreshing change from the presently stagnant quagmire of  contempory fantasy then this take a chance and try Game Of Thrones. You  won't be sorry.
B00003CX7K|4.0|This is the first in a new age of films. Really they shouldn't be called films anymore, there's no filming involved! This was a pretty good, I never bothered to see the original but having been told the second one was  better, took the oppertunity to go and see it. <br />It's very different from  any film you've seen before. Because the charecters aren't real people, you  would expect it to be a cartoon. Not so. It's isn't a sequence of animated  drawings either. It's somewhere inbetween, but its feels really strange  watching it.<br />Contrary to popular opinion, the film is suitable for ages.  There is lots of stuff in it which is hillairusly funny no matter what age  you are(similar to The Simpsons). When I saw it, I was with a bunch of  French exchange students. They all found it 'tres rigole'(very funny)<br />In  conclusion it is a fantastic film with a revolutionary way of producing.  Thre is a good story line, but the best thing is that its really  entertaining for all age groups. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars  is that it really isn't my type of 'film'.
B00004SCX6|5.0|britney has done it again.....this cd is full of great songs and of different varieties.  Lucky and Oops are upbeat pop songs, but Dear Diary and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know are soft, heartfelt songs.  this cd is  a MUST BUY.
B000002G87|5.0|Whatever the genre, great music always seems to come from powerful emotions. When he recorded this album, Eric Clapton was going through a real emotional wringer and this comes over so clearly here.<br />You can hear  pain and frustration in his voice. This is a real case of an artist opening  his soul and it makes for great music.<br />One quite remarkable thing is  that, although the songs here were not all written by the band for the  album, they all sound as though they were. Everything fits and the sum  total is a set of songs that sound as if they belong together without there  being any feeling of repetition. That is truely remarkable for over seventy  minutes of music.<br />For me, the musical peak has to be &quot;Layla&quot;  but &quot;Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out&quot; and &quot;Have  You Ever Loved a Woman&quot; are also great performances.<br />This album was  a band effort and all members are pulling their weight but that seems to  have brought the best out of Clapton. Throughout his career, he has always  been at his best when he has been a member rather than a leader. Too many  of his pure solo works just seem to be a case of banging out another album  without putting much into it.<br />Here you get Clapton's finest work and what  just might be the best blues-rock album of all time. It's an essential part  of any rock music collection.
0783239408|5.0|&quot;I rule!&quot; is one of the many things that Lester Burnham says  during his nervous breakdown.  He is the main character in this excellent  movie about suburban America. Starring Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey this  movie makes you laugh as you get pulled into its wonderful story.  Kevin  Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a husband and father who decides to pursue  a life in smoking pot, working at a fast food restaurant, and chasing after  a high school girl who happens to be her daughter's best friend.    Meanwhile his wife (Annette Bening), a real estate salesman, is also having  a nervous breakdown.  She cheats on Lester with some other guy who is also  in real estate.  This provides one of the most amusing scenes in the movie  when Bening is making out in a van with that guy and they are driving  through a fast food place; the place where Lester works.  He catches them  red-handed and its just, hilarious.  The Burnham's neighbors also have a  large part in the movie even though they are just basically supporting the  Burnham family's characters.  They are also a three-person family.  The  father is abusive and prejudice, the mother just takes it all and doesn't  say a word, and their son (newcomer Wes Bentley) is Lester's drug-dealer  and also becomes his daughter's girlfriend.  From what I have written I  hope you can decide if you are interested in this movie.  I would not  recommend it to people easily offended.  I would recommend it to people who  like dark comedies.  So give it a shot.  I think you will probably enjoy  it.
B00000064G|5.0|My first exposure to Nick Drake was the VW commercial that seems to have given him new exposure.  However it was reading an article in Entertainment Weekly (5/12/00) that prompted my interest to explore Nick and his music  further.  I kept reading such wonderful things about the beauty of his  music, his voice, as well as his untimely death that I felt compelled to  buy an album of his. I am so glad I did, it was haunting as well as  compelling.  It is a shame that he was not truly recognized while he was  still alive. I listened to this album and was only dissapointed with one  thing...that it wasn't longer!   As a side note, if you like Nick  Drake...try Jeff Buckley (another wonderful artist that we lost to soon)

B00000ILDE|5.0|I remember going to see Aliens at the Movies back in High School.  I loved it soo much that I went out and bought the book and came across parts in the book, that of course were not in the movie.  Aliens Special Edition  puts those parts back in and completely restores this movie to greatness.   Sometimes you get movies that have scenes that have been put back into the  movie that were left out and end up making the movie horrible(i.e. Night of  the Living Dead).  Just like the added scenes in The Abyss, the added  scenes in Aliens do not take away from the movie, but only make it better.   The added scenes are everywhere in the Movie.  I won't try and spoil it for  you but give you what you will see.  You get to see the Colony on LV-426  before they get attacked, you see the Family with Newt that gets orders  from Burke to check out the area Ripley stated the derlict alien ship was  located at , you see some of the measures the Marines took to protect them  selves in Med Lab, and you get to see that Hicks and Ripley actually had  something starting in the whole mess.  It is really worth looking at and I  just had to have this DVD for my collection.  I suggest you do the same.
B00004SCX6|2.0|The lyrics are good, the music is catchy, but the girl has no talent.  She's managed to ruin some potentially good songs!  Do us a favor... give  the music to someone who will do it justice.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Ok, her songs are catchy, I admit it. But are radio stations DJ Adam Smasher is a mastermind. She seems to set herself up for his parodies. (Checkout the 104KRBE website) her voice is flat, and her songs bore me.  Her voice is obviously electronicly enhanced, and you can tell. I'd give it  a one but oops is an DECENT song. Basicly this album shows  her no talent,  and it sucks!
B000023X9W|5.0|I wasn't a particularly big fan of the latest CSNY disc, so I had some concerns about Silver &amp; Gold.  But the album proved to be brilliant.  It may be pretty short, but then again, we had albums this short in the  60's, so we can stop being spoiled for once!  Although this album cannot  even be compared to such classics as After The Goldrush and Harvest, it is  still a great album and highly recommended for anyone who appreciates a  good singer/songwriter.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I just purchased this CD, and I love it.  Now I know what everyone has been raving about!
B00003CWL6|1.0|This movie was one of the worst I've seen in a while.  It glorifies sexual abuse and under-age sex.  Gimmie a break... I can't believe this movie won best picture.  Sixth Sense was ten times better.  DON'T BOTHER.
B00004SCX6|4.0|After listening to the entire album several times, Ifelt that the beautiful talented dancer had completely no talent in singing. I was sucked in by all the hype. But enjoying the album did not have anything to do with  her voice. Instead, it is the pop music that counts. I could care less  about what she was singing about. To make a long story short, I really  enjoyed most of the album.
B00004SST6|5.0|The only thing wrong with this album is , it isn't long enough! Benson's guitar is as sweet as ever. My advise? BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT!
B000002W3R|4.0|&quot;Moody Blue&quot; has been artifact as much as album since its 1977 release. Some bought for the commemorative blue vinyl, others because more copies were in stock those long, last hot August days. But those who  listened (and may have bought the LP even before Elvis Presley's passing)  found the album reassuring and frustrating, reminding you how much was  lost.<br />Connecting nearly every strand of American music, Presley commanded  his voice and image, if not life, until the end. His versions of  &quot;Little Darlin'&quot; and &quot;Pledging My Love,&quot; songs  originally released beside his first classics, are playful and skillful in  respective live and studio renditions. Two country standards, &quot;He'll  Have To Go,&quot; and a superb &quot;She Thinks I Still Care,&quot; are  given a touch of Memphis soul, which also revs the two live remakes of  Olivia Newton-John's country-pop cupcakes.<br />The album's hits, the title  track and &quot;Way Down,&quot; are its saddest happy songs. The latter is  a country-blues rocker featuring some great James Burton guitar and  southern gospel background. The title track is a country-pop gem, arranged  by Bergen White, with just a touch of disco. This is a style Presley  could've taken to the charts a few more times...given the chance. But  &quot;Moody Blue,&quot; short and sweet, remains one of Elvis' better 70s  albums (certainly better than the cheapo repackages that followed his  death),and a recommended, supplemental choice for fans.
0670824399|4.0|I like the book Madilda because it's a very funny book. I like the part where she superglues the hat to her Dad's head. Also when she goes to her mean principal's house and messes it all up and gets Ms. Honey's doll, she  had when she was a little girl. At the end of the book, I like when Ms.  Honey adopts Matilda.
B00000AFWW|4.0|when i firts heard the cd i really didnt like a few of the song.i didnt like &quot;hit so hard&quot; and i  dint like &quot;boys on the radio&quot;...becoz theyre really strctures pop songs,mainstream oriented.i  dont have something against mainstream-pop:maybe when i first heard i was  just shocked...it was to expect that they wouldnt do a new grungy  &quot;live through this&quot; but that they recorded so soft songs too  surprised me.the other songs i liked from the first second on.there are a  few songs on it you have to hear several times to like them becoz theyre  not typical for what you expect from hole...but i quite like them  all,now....but i still think &quot;boys on the radio&quot; and first part  of &quot;petals&quot;  is a bit weak.to less power...but other like  especially &quot;boys on the radio&quot;,that im sure becoz itspop with  structure,with concept.the whole cd is a concept-cd in a way.the lyrics are  good and theyre about different thing but all in all the title says  it:celebrity skin....i really like &quot;playing your song&quot;(hole  announced it should be their last grunge song)..and the other fast/punky  songs.but the album is dominated by  the calmer songs and perhaps ts good  as this.hole is progressive...at least a bit.another grunge album would  have been boring...but if you never listened to hole before...buy  &quot;live through this&quot;..it is better and it shows was the band was  in hte early nineties
6305807043|3.0|1999 was a great year for movies in Australia, with Go, Run Lola Run, Election, Cube and this film, Being John Malkovich. These were all films that dared to do something different and it didn't hurt that they were all quite good too.<br />In this film, things seem to shift focus quite frequently. It starts off with John Cusack looking for a job and ending up working in a very strange place. Initially, it's just funny with a weird boss, offices taking up half a floor and some equally strange co-workers. .... Things get progressively stranger and ultimately becomes sinister but the film is no less enjoyable for the change of tone. <br />Notable is the chase through the memories in John Malkovich's head, quite reminiscent of the Sminoff Vodka advertisement with characters running through scenes in that would be impossible to connect in the real world.<br />The cast is brilliant, Cameron Diaz is almost unrecognisable from how we usually see her and outstanding. Caroline Keener did get an Oscar nomination and of course there is John Malkovich playing an actor who is not quite as famous as he is in the real world (I think the jewel thief movie everyone think's he was in was he was Entrapment - Well that's my theory) and just a bit stranger too.  Particularly entertaining is the fight everyone has over possession of John Malkovich's body while overlooking the fact he's the only one entitled to it.<br />John Cusack also stands out as a particularly tragic character, a man who is just as good at puppeteering as his famous contemporaries but can only gain recognition and fame using the springboard of someone else who is already famous because he just can't get that first break he needs. As things start to turn on him, he gets increasingly desperate and begins a terminal slide to disaster. Despite the increasingly inexcusable things he ends up doing, he pays what could only be described as the ultimate price that even he didn't deserve. An important lesson on when good peoplestart doing bad things, it gets hard to stop<br />Films like this should be supported as much as possible because they are not just recycling the same old thing over and over again with increasingly diminishing results. Spike Jonze and everyone else involved has made a very good film.
B00000IPAX|1.0|I'll admit, I don't actually have this CD, but I have heard all of the songs at 1 time or another. Every song is watered-down-radio-friendly-pop-  punk. Blink 182 has changed(not for the better) since their days of  &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; and &quot;Buddha&quot;. I don't even like those,  but they are far better than &quot;Enema...&quot;. The songs on this CD  basically use the same formula over &amp; over and make the songs as catchy  as possible, not paying any attention to musicianship. I still don't see  how they got Bad Religion to tour w/ them.(Now there's a good band that's  been on the punk scene since the '80s and stayed indie). Lyric-wise, Blink  182 has not matured, &amp; have the same sophomoric humor &amp; shoddy  jokes as before. Check out the Dead Kennedys if you want candid, hilarious  lyrics that are not only witty, but are satiracal stabs at American culture  &amp; politics. If you're still into pop-punk, listen to QUALITY pop, like  the Ramones(who are famous for the &quot;hey-ho!&quot;'s), or the  Buzzcocks.   Contrary to what people think, punks do not consider bands  that become popular &quot;sell-outs&quot;. (Remember '95, when Rancid  became a hit on Mtv w/ &quot;Time Bomb&quot;? They didn't change their  musical stance on their next record, or tone it down; instead, they drew  more heavily on their Clash roots) Sell-outs are bands that betray their  cause or background to become more popular. I think that would hold true  for w/ Blink 182. Gone is the hyper guitar work, &amp; in are the recycled  chords that characterize a lot pop music that is on the radio.    In  conclusion, for all of those new &quot;punks&quot; who think Blink 182 is  the best band in the world, do yourself a favor &amp; trade this CD in  &amp; listen to punk rock(&amp; deviations of punk) w/ a message.(i.e. the  Clash, the Sex Pistols, the Specials, the Police, Fugazi, the Minutemen,  the Dead Kennedys, D.O.A, Rancid, Operation Ivy, Minor Threat, Black Flag,  or Bad Brains).
B00003CWOL|2.0|While Clerks, Mallrats &amp; Chasing Amy are amoung my favorite movies, I found Dogma disappointing.  Unlike the earlier movies, it did not suffer from a lack of star power (Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, George  Carlin, etc.). <br />Silent Bob &amp; Jay's antics were sometimes funning in  Dogma, but they seemed out of place.  It seemed as if they were only  present to leverage the success of the other movies.  That worked well in  Mallrats and Chasing Amy, but it didn't here.<br />The movie appeared to be  primarily a commentary on religion, in particular the Catholic Church.   Like most commentaries wrapped as comedies, it was often rather simplistic.  What I took away from it was that the Catholic Church is bad.  Okay, that  is not a horrible thing to say, but it is really not that  interesting.<br />The film did have some funny spots, and if you are a NJ  Triology fan, you will propably see it no matter what the reviews say.
0790732254|5.0|This is one of cinemas ultimate emotional rollercoasters. It contains what are widely reputed as being the best screen performances of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor and I for one agree with this. This is due not only to  their talent and hard work but to the exceptional quality of the writing  and directing. Playwright Edward Albee makes George and Martha win our  sympathy. The picture shows a couple whose career and family aspirations  have been so frustrated that if they are not at each others throats, they  retreat into a fantasy world where they are raising a son. Some audiences  may find the relentless bantering and vindictiveness between the couple  excessive but this degree of intensity is true to the work. Of sure  interest from a psycholgical point of view are the dynamics between the two  couples who have gathered for  'drinks'. We see each members frailties and  heartaches and agony but also their capacity for ruthlessness. The picture  is a no holds barred exploration of the dark night of the soul. If you can  bear the deep anguish of the piece (it won't be everyone's cup of tea!) you  will witness some of the most honest and heartfelt writing and acting that  is ever likely to be captured on film.
B000003NA3|5.0|This is the greatest CD or album in my opinion that has been recorded. When I was a very young boy I heard the first release and when I heard it I was completely enthralled. I am still enthralled. Dolphy is incredible,  beyond mere words. Coltrane has a group of musicians that he finds no  boundaries with or limitations. Elvin Jones and the bassists are also  astonishing. To this day when I hear this music I must stop what I am  doing.<br />This should have a million stars.
0425170349|1.0|This was the best book I have ever read. I like how  the spies where those special Uniforms. the characters did many exiting stuff. I gave this book 1 star because it taught children bad stuff. This is the most wonderful book  I have ever read. cheap too! I would recomend it for you.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Listen, if you are at ALL a fan of Eminem...you MUST own this CD...it's as simple as that...even more 'in-your-face' than the first album, Shady delivers each line to your ears with a rhythm that is as smooth as  butter....If I could give this masterpiece more than five stars, I  would...ENJOY
B00000JCB2|1.0|aside from the fact that the content of this whole album is drivel, i would like to bring to light the fact that limp 'you-know-what' bizkit has released two albums (significant other and 3dollar bill y'all) also in  &quot;EDITED&quot; form.  Just so all you kiddies know, bands DO have a  choice as to release an album where they freely express their art (however  stupid it may be) with no censorship.  Limp Bizkit has chosen twice to  sacrifice whatever integrity they have just so they can put their albums in  Wal Mart and other such unconstitutional institutions.  They edited their  art so that more of you testosterone amped disenchanted american youths  could vent your midwest frustrations while they cash in on your inequities.   Good work my fellow americans!
B00004T9UF|5.0|WHAT A FOLLOW-UP. LOVE IT. BUY IT. THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP IS THE BEST ALBUM TO COME OUT THIS YEAR.
B00003CWL5|5.0|One day this film will be tought in schools. Not just film classes, but social studies and psychology classes too! Sam Mendes (Director) and Allen Ball (Script) have made a film larger than it's parts. And what good parts  they are, too. <br />Kevin Spacey, as lonely husband Lester, again shows us  just why he wins so many awards. His performance is so perfect, everything  that comes out of his mouth is instantly believable. I'm not a fan of  narrated plot advances, but when the narrator is dead man, these advances  take on added dimension. This is not only the best role of his career, but  one of the best roles on film. Notice when he realizes the  cheerleader-whore of his dreams is in fact a virgin. You'll see!<br />The last  10 seconds of Annette Bennings' &quot;Carolyn&quot; say more with no words  than most roles say in an entire film. Those 10 seconds make you instantly  realize what a great part she'd been playing all along. You simply must see  her performance! I didn't realize just how good she was until I saw  her  here. <br />The members of the &quot;Fitts Family&quot; (the new family next  door) do such fine ensemble acting, they give underscored meaning the the  term &quot;Dysfunctional&quot;. Wes Bently (Ricky Fitts) is going to be  huge! He  makes his camera weilding freak turn from mernacing to adorable  in 5 seconds - with not a word spoken! That's acting. When he see's a  chance to leave his schitzo Mom and homophobic ex-soldier Dad by pretending  to be gay, your heart reaches out in every direction. When the consequences  of this deception surface, you will be horrified! Not a simple  accomplishment in just 15 minutes of filmaking.<br />This film succeeds on so  many levels. I don't generally like my comedy fueled with so much Drama, or  vice-versa, however, great acting - writing and directing, when executed  with such  symbiosis make this one of those films from which any student of  life will learn.<br />After all is said and done, Mendes proves that it's not  values or morals that realy matter. It's all just a bunch of random acts of  kindness and violence that make us live... or die.
B00004S6GL|4.0|This is Elliot Smith's worst album but it is still better than ant of the dribble that is out today.Son Of Sam has all the workings of a classic.This album as a must for fans of good music.
B00004SCX6|4.0|i really think that britney spears has done a good job on her new cd. although everyone says that her new cd and her old one really are bad they really are not.  they are more mature than her first cd but the songs are  still catchy all the same way to go britney on the new LP!
B000007OY0|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption definitely ranks in my top ten favorite movies of all-time. It is an excellent movie that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a bank manager who has been convicted of murdering his wife and sent to  serve out a life sentence in Shawshank prison. He quickly meets an inmate  named Red (played by Morgan Freeman) who helps him through some of the  struggles of prison life. Between frequent beatings by the  &quot;Sisters&quot; and isolation, Andy Dufresne makes it his will to  survive. This movie isn't so much about prison life as it is about life in  general, which is what makes it so good. <br />The screenplay was  well-written, based upon the Stephen King novella &quot;Rita Hayworth and  the Shawshank Redemption&quot;. In my opinion (some people will disagree)  in this particular case, the movie is better than the book. The story is  slowly laid out before the viewer and certain incidents are introduced  throughout the movie that show the integrity of Andy Dufresne as well as  his ingenuity (i.e. doing taxes for the prison guards). It helps if you pay  attention to every little detail since they all collectively contribute to  the turning point or climax. <br />Without a doubt, the best part of the movie  is the climax, which occurs near the end. I was totally taken away by what  was revealed and I hadn't even expected it. You will definitely need to  watch the movie to find out what happens here -- don't let anyone ruin it  for you by telling you ahead of time. <br />Overall, with the great story,  good casting and acting, and an interesting soundtrack, the Shawshank  Redemption is a classic movie that should not be missed. After I saw it on  T.V. I went out and bought the movie and have watched it a number of times.  Highly recommended for anyone as it tells a great story about life,  struggle, and redemption.
B000001FS3|5.0|If you're new to U2,all I can say, &quot;where have you been hiding?&quot;  But hey, come along and take a listen to the best band of the millenium...take my word for it and please, trust me, listen to side two  first; I know I'm speaking in album terms since that's how long it's been  around, plus, like another reviewer on this critique page I have worn out  the album and cassette and have moved on through two copies of the CD.   Listen to Red Hill Mining Town; such an overlooked song, (and video) that I  am dissapointed that U2 didn't finally get around releasing the video that  was made but has never surfaced (a collector might have it  somewhere..e-mail me please!dpsquire42@excite.com)and the rest of the side  that was severely overlooked by the mainstream were, In God's Country, One  Tree Hill, Trip Through Your Wires, Exit (Headphones a must on this one in  particular) and Mothers of the Dissapeared.  The Producers, Brian Eno and  Daniel Lanois are the masterminds behind the genius of the recordings.   Their work with other artists such as David Bowie, Peter Gabriel not to  mention there own work, too plays a huge role in there mesmerizing  collaboration, here. I can't say more other than buy this, play it (a lot),  cherrish it and research the rest of U2 preceding this CD (and after)if you  really don't know U2 ,specifically &quot;The Unforgettable  Fire&quot;...Pull your head out of the muck of whatever else you listen to  and try 'em...you won't be dissapointed. Trust Me.
6304698798|5.0|Sorry, but I'm going to have to add the usual 'one of the greatest Westerns ever made' phrase to my review. Not only because I generally hate Westerns and this is the only one I like, but because it's one of the best  films in any genre.<br />The DVD itself is a good quality in both vision &amp;  sound. The only annoying thing is that it is in mono Dolby, which although  its the clearest I've ever heard it (fantastic score etc..). Watching the  extra Italian scenes, you realise that they are actually played in Dolby  surround.<br />ps Pity there wasn't a running commentary by Eli or Clint.  Perhaps that'll be in a 35th or 40th Annivesary edition? One can only hope.
158234082X|1.0|I have no doubt that some of what the author shares is true.  In any profession there are individuals who lack &quot;professionalism&quot;.  I certainly will think twice before ordering any type of seafood other than  on Tuesday through Thursday and will never look at a Sunday buffet in the  same way - if I ever go to one again.  After the numerous references to his  drug use throughout the book, I can't help but wonder how much of what was  written is factual or a product of a hallucination.  If I didn't know  better I could almost believe that the book originated as a part of a  therapy homework assignment and the author's need to gain perspective as  well as find some meaning to his life.  Maybe I am an idealist, but I like  to think there are professionals in the culinary world who enjoy what they  do, run decent kitchens and are not out to gouge the public.  If anyone  wants a copy of this book I know where a copy can be secured for free. It  is certainly not one I recommend nor plan on keeping.  I cannot in good  conscience even donate it to the local library.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is by far better than Eminem's first cd &quot;The Slim Shady  LP&quot;.  I Love Eminem and I love rap.  I have bought over 30 rap cd's in  the last year, and this is by far the best.  I definitely recommend this CD  to rap lovers even if u hate Eminem.  If U R thinking about buying this CD  stop thinking.  BUY IT!
080017948X|5.0|I never got to catch this movie in the theather or cable.  Only on regular tv.  After seeing it on in it's how it was meant to be presented I love Groundhog Day ten times more.  Funny!   Hurt your belly funny.  Easy one  of my favorite Bill Murry Movies.  There aren't a lot of DVD special  features on the disk, but the clarity of the movie  is really the only  thing that matters here.  And that is excellent.  A must have for the  collection if you are ever up at 2am and want a laugh.
B000000LZV|5.0|True rock and roll is about more than whiny rooster-boys depressed over not getting laid. The MINUTEMEN were a politically activist band,  discussing topics from El Salvador to the music industry. Great songs:  &quot;#1 Hit Song,&quot; &quot;God Bow to Math,&quot; &quot;Jesus and  Tequilla,&quot; and many more.  These boys rocked from the gut. They  pirated music styles (as good Rock and Roll does) from Tex-Mex, to disco  and pop. Their lyrics are subtle and considered. True punk rock: it's  stripped down and could be played even if all the electricity went out.  Mike Watt is still going: may the flannel fly long and high.
B000002KHY|5.0|This album features the best and most popular of JT's work in the 70's and I think it is the best collection.  This music make me think back to 70's and all the good times I had with family and friends, especially all those  pool parties.  &quot;Carolina In My Mind&quot;, &quot;You've Got A  Friend&quot;, and &quot;How Sweet It Is&quot; will make you sing along.  I  think those songs are engrained in a lot of our minds.  But my favorite  track on this album is &quot;Mexico&quot;.  Every time I hear it, I have  the urge to grill out and make margaritas.  When a song can do that, it's  something special.
0783231482|5.0|\\"The Blues Brothers\\" still manages to surprise and delight after numerous viewings over nearly three decades. It seems self-evident that the magic of John Belushi goes a long way to explaining the success of this film. The  on-stage chemistry with Dan Aykroyd just works, somehow lifting this  B-movie plot up onto a higher level. And of course, the music helps - what  blues lover could fail to enjoy the range and depth of the performances by  some of the great bluesmen of the twentieth century. I suppose it's an  extra delight to be able to enjoy the blues antics of the main characters  as well. <br />If you haven't seen it, get it at once - it's not only a  classic that will endure, it's also good (mostly) family entertainment and  it's a tribute to a great actor who was, tragically, much nearer to the end  of his career when he made this, that he ought to have been.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Absolutely wonderful follow-up to the Slim Shady LP.  The lyrics have, if anything, gotten more hardcore.  He takes shots at everyone (e.g. Christina, Britney, *N Sync, Jennifer Lopez, Puffy).  I'd recommend it to  everyone who is an eminem fan, its great.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The new album is definatly a great follow up to &quot;The Slim Shady LP.&quot; Eminem still proves that he does not care what anybody thinks about him.  With songs like &quot;The Way I am&quot; anwsers right back to  everyone that talked back to him.  The song &quot;Stan,&quot; is about an  obsessed fan who kills himself and his girlfriend because he doesn't anwser  his letters and follow what eminem says in his songs. In &quot;The Real  Slim Shady&quot;, He makes fun of Tom Green, boy bands, Christina Agulera.   She was very upset about it too.  The album is really a good come back for  Eminem against people who talked bad about him in the past year.  He also  wants to let you know that he is back and here to stay, although he never  really left.
B00000J7J4|5.0|After hearing so many, 'best of ....' and 'the very best of.....' it was so good to hear a new collection of Santana tunes. Anyone who thinks that the Moonflower Album was sensational will rethink after hearing  Supernatural. I heard one song once and bought the album. Do the same !
B00004T8RK|3.0|Well I will try to keep this short. This album is pretty god but PJ has lost something. The songs lack emotion. They dont get inside of you. I thought the first three albums were by far the best. No Code(their worst  effort) and Yield werent as good but had some decent songs...songs where yu  just think wow and replay it over and over. This album lacks that, maybe it  will grow on me. Its very mellow and not what you are probaly expecting or  hoping for.......
B00004SCX6|3.0|I was really disapointed when I bought this cd. It is really a fart, do you know why? Because this cd came too early and really in the wrong time.Britney in an interview to a Brazilian network said &quot;I promise,  my voice will be better and much more mature&quot; well...she didn't quite  kept that promise.  The songs are nice, but it seems the beat is the same  in every song. I must confess I really enjoyed some songs like  &quot;Satisfaction&quot; that is a very interesting version and I really  liked the songs that were written by Shania Twain and Diane Warren. It is a  pity that britney still don't have the gift to write her own songs( She  only wrote one song, &quot;Dear Diary&quot;) but well, what can I do? This  cd is nice,nothing beyond that... sorry Brit, you didn't &quot;did it  again&quot;.
B00000J7J4|2.0|How far can you blow a CD out of proportion?  &quot;Supernatural&quot; was made out to be the ultimate CD, everyone was saying it was so great, blah blah blah.  Then there was the Grammy awards where Santana swept the  evening.  All I can ask is why?  He doesn't write the songs, and the only  time he sings is when he chants &quot;Oh bah me ma mama jeemah&quot; in the  background of a couple of songs.  He didn't bowl people over in the 70's,  so why is anything different now?  Yeah, he plays the guitar.  So what?  So  does Eric Clapton, and I didn't see him winning a billion awards for 1998's  &quot;Pilgrim&quot;.  The problem is, the Grammy Awards get one artist in  their heads per year, and won't get them out.  Lauryn Hill was a disgrace  in '98.  Her songs were garbage, yet she beat out better bands in all of  the categories.  Stop with the yearly obsessions already!  The album kicks  off with the utterly bizarre &quot;(Da Le) Yaleo&quot;, a mix of island  music and funk.  And it only gets worse from there.  &quot;Put Your Lights  On&quot; is a song that just gets under your skin.  With Everlast droning  &quot;put your lights on&quot; constantly in the background, it is not a  memorable song, and certainly not one you will ever get a huge urge to hear  again.  Then there is the radio hit, &quot;Maria Maria&quot;.  Santana's  guitar playing is too good for this stupid song that has no melody  whatsoever.  The only good song on the album is &quot;Smooth&quot;, yes the  song that the radio beat to death a few months ago.  That's good because it  was written by Rob Thomas, a man who actually possesses musical talent.   Other than that, you can't even understand the music on the CD.  I enjoy  latin music, but this is just ridiculous.  Coming from the man who was  singing &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; a few decades ago, this is a terrible  dissapointment.  As I said before, the only good thing about this album is  the guitar playing by Carlos Santana.  Other than that,all you get is an  eclectic bunch of &quot;artists&quot; singing about nothing.  All those  Grammys were a waste of metal!  What were you people thinking?  This CD is  a waste of time and money, and it was a wasted effort put forth by those  who made it.  WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL WITH SANTANA?   Do yourself a favor,  stop giving your hard-earned money to people who don't deserve to be  receiving it.  Avoid this CD at all costs.
B00000I8BX|4.0|I was blown away by the raw heavyness and precision of Edgecrusher. Fear Factory has expanded their musical talent as well by writing songs such as Decent. While I agree with the majority that demanufacture is a better  album, this still is a must-have for anyone ready to get angry and break  stuff.
B00004T9UF|5.0|EVEN BETTER THAN THE SLIM SHADY LP IF U CAN BELIEVE THAT.  BEST CUT OFF THE NEW ALBUM...STAN.  INTENSE, SMART, AND GREAT BACKGROUND VOCALS.  THIS CD IS DEFINITELY A MUST-BUY...SO GO GET IT...RIGHT NOW...GO...RUN...WHAT  ARE U WAITING FOR...GET UP OUT OF YOUR CHAIR AND GO!
0156528207|5.0|Though the book sounds as if it was meant for younger readers, I am convinced that Antoine wrote the book for us. Adults. It seems that too many times we lose sight of the wonder and beauty of life. Antoine uses the  Little Prince character to open our hearts. The world desensitizes us to  the simple pleasures that are around us. We are conditioned to think that  money and possessions are what will make us happiest. Many of us live our  whole lives in pursuit of a that dream. The Little Prince simply needs his  rose to show him that this illusion will never make anyone happy.  To me,  the pilot of the plane represents the lost child within us that is starving  for whimsy and wonder, that longs to be free to imagine and create  uninhibited. The Little Prince shows us that all is not lost, if you simply  know that in your lifelong search for happiness, you have already found  what you are looking for.
1878424319|5.0|I bought and completed reading &quot;The Four Agreements this past  weekend...it is uplifting, powerful, to the point, honest...it works. I  cannot imagine what the world would feel like, if every person practised  the &quot;Four Agreements.&quot; I have spent this morning e-mailing a lot  of the people I truly care about and I am encouraging them to go right out  TODAY and purchase their copy, and read it tonight. Up to now, Shakti  Gawain's &quot;Creative Visualization,&quot; has been one of my most  important guides, now I have two important guides: Creative Visualizations,  &amp; The Four Agreements. A MUST READ for anyone who truly desires a  better life!. Love to hear your comments re the book.
0440219078|4.0|Do you sometimes wish you lived in a utopia? do you wish you lived in a  world with no poverty, no robbers, no pollution, no color, no love, and no  warfare? Well, this story is about a boy named Jonas. Jonas is living in  that world, and he thinks he lives like everyone else and has a pretty good  lfe. He has a mom, a dad, and a sister, named Lily. He also has friends  like Fiona and Asher.   During the story, he meets the Giver who shows  him how the world used to be when there was love and warfare. He makes  Jonas have memories about warfare and love. jonas learns that his life is  boring compared to what the world used to be.          Jonas meets  the Giver during the twelve ceremony whe the 12-year-old kids get their  jobs.  Jonas is skipped, but at the end of the ceremony , Jonas learns that  he is the receiver of the community.   Later in the book, Jonas decided  that he has to leave the community and go where these memories are real.   He brings his half brother, Gabe, with him because if didn't , Gabe would  be killed. Gabe is a baby, who no one wants because he doesn't sleep  through the night, so the leader of the community is going to release Gabe.  Jonas' dad doesn't like this, so he taked the chold and makes Gabe one of  his own, but the master says that they were going to release him, and it is  out of Jonas' father's hands. Jonas decided to take Gabe and run away.   At the end, Jonas gets to a community with color and love.  I liked  this book, and I recomend it to everyone because it has action and  adventure, and it tells you a utopia isn't always a good thing. I though  there could have been a better ending. Lowry didn't talk about Jonas' new  community and if he liked it or not. I hope she makes another book about  his new community. I give this book four out of five stars. I would have  given it five stars if she had written a better ending.
B00004T9UF|5.0|listen up!  this is probably the best rap album i have ever heard in my life!  the best songs are Kill You, The Real Slim Shady, I'm Back, and Under The Influence.  there are awesome beats and the best and even  funniest rapping!  if you like rap songs at all you gotta get this!
6303421563|4.0|Luc Besson is known for his stylish action films that also have dramatic depth. He does manage to create some exciting action-packed sequences, and does create a credible relationship between Portman and Reno, but he  ultimately leans to the mushy sentimentality that he avoided in his earlier  films. Jean Reno is great as the lovable milk-drinking hitman. Natalie  Portman gives an astonishing performance that may well be her best. The  film has surprising sexual undercurrents, the 'lolita' kind. Gary Oldman is  way over the top but he does create a fun merciless character. A worthy  effort, but could of been better. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a  7!
6305064490|4.0|To correct T Hinde of Sydney(in a below review)It's A Wonderful Life has been shown every Christmas in Australia for decades and a video,with documentary has been available there for years.I have seen it on TV a dozen  times. The film is a classic feel-good movie and the documentary is also  interesting.This film can be viewed over and over and is well worth  getting.
0140177396|5.0|i thought the book was pretty boring but i guess it wasn't.. its all 'bout rasicm and how a person work wit another person whose mind is like a child..
0671004107|5.0|I don't know what these one star raters are thinking. If nothing else this book and movie give you some very important things to think about. We are not alone be it an alien civilization or an omnipresent, omniscient God. I  like to think that both exist together. There is also the hope that we may  be reunited with our lost loved ones, be it in a tropical Pensacola  paradise or the Paradise that Christ describes for us in the Bible. Either  way it would be wonderful. I can't think of a better way to spend an  evening or two reading this book or watching the movie. Thank you Carl for  giving us this part of you.
B00004T8RK|5.0|One true maxim that every great rock band clings to is CHANGE.  I'm tired of hearing people whine about how PJ doesn't emit &quot;ten&quot;-like albums anymore.  Folks, 10 will go down in history as a classic rock  album....but PJ needed to distance themselves from that album and they have  done so on every album leading up to Binaural.  Matt Cameron has always  impressed me as a skin-basher and he doesn't disappoint on his first album  with PJ.  Its refreshing to see Vedder relinquishing the creative reigns  abit...ament and gossard both contributing lyrical and musical  arrangements. &quot;of the girl&quot; is a haunting piece of work with a  middle eastern tinge to it...McCready is still as electrifying as ever on  lead...and it seems as though &quot;gasp&quot; vedder is singing some nice  love songs...maybe has softened in his old age.(naaahhh) He still has the  best screaming voice in rock today.  The masses may not be drawn to this  album...but that's ok...PJ will continue to evolve and change directions.   Hopefully they can hang onto Cameron for awhile...he's tight.  All in  all..Binaural rocks with authority.
0679721037|4.0|Hiroshima, by John Hersey, is about the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and what happened to six people before and after the explosion.  Their names are Miss. Toshiko Sasaki, Dr. Masakazu Fujii, Mrs. Hatsuyo  Nakamura, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki and the Rev. Mr.  Kiyoshi Tanimoto.  Hiroshima is a very graphic book with sickening  descriptions.  I think that some of these descriptions were as graphic as  the ones in The Hot Zone, by Richard Preston.  \\"Pus oozed out of her wound,  and soon the whole pillow was covered with it.\\"(Pg.81) is just one of the  many gory descriptions from Hiroshima.<br />I thought that Hiroshima had its  ups and downs.  For one, the book was very confusing because there were  lots of people and the story kept switching from on person to another.  I  found myself lost in a a sea of words at times because of this.  That was  the main bad facet of the book.  On the other hand, I thought the book was  good because when you did understand what was happening, you felt as if you  were actually there because the descriptions in Hiroshima were so vivid.   Also, I like the book because it showed you what actually happened in  Hiroshima and Nagasaki and what could happen if a nuclear war broke out.   Overall, I though Hiroshima was a good book.  I would recommend this book  to people who like History and especially WW2.

0684800713|5.0|Ernest, Ernest, what the heck were you thinking when you wrote this existential treatise to the Lost Penis?  Lost Generation, hell, I think Mr. Hemingway was concerned with a completely different loss, that portion of  the male anatomy that seems to, ahem, stick in everyone's brain when they  read this gloriously minimalist book.  One of the few things I got out of  college English and/or Lit classes was the observation by an otherwise  pompous associate professor that Hemingway (more likely his editor) pared  his prose to the point that every word was perfect and necessary, and that  these words comprised equally perfect sentences and paragraphs and chapters  ad nauseum.  But he had a point.  The only two things wrong with this book  have to do with Mr. Barnes, ahem, short-coming, which seemed contrived to  me, and the not so subtle racism.  But the latter point is like complaining  about Huckleberry Finn, The Sun Also Rises is a product of its time, like  Finn was a product of Twain's, and if you don't apply today's standards and  are capable of holding your unease, you'll find here some of the most  elegant writing in the English language.
B00004STUL|5.0|Yeah, yeah, so I put the producer and director in my comment rather than the two main actors.  When these two guys get together, you know the screen's going to explode (see also THE ROCK and ARMAGEDDON).  These two  guys really know how to make an action movie.<br />Will Smith and Martin  Lawrence make a great on screen pair.  The personalities just mesh so  well...their banter is so good, you wonder how much is ad libbed.<br />This  movie is all high paced action and suspense.  The action scenes are  awesome.  The chase scene on foot is spectacular (who knew that a cop  chasing a bad guy on foot could be so exciting).  Now, although the car  chase scene at the very end is so fake (there is no way that Porsche with  three people in it could've caught the Cobra when it had such a long head  start), this movie was still really good.  For all you adrenalin junkies,  go out and rent/buy it today!
0440219078|5.0|The Giver is a great book about a boy named Jonas who lives inan almost perfect community with no future, no choices, and nopain. When Jonas is chosen to be the new receiver of memories, his whole life changes.  The community in which Jonas lives is plain and flat, with no hills, and the weather is always the same, with no rain or snow. All the houses are the same. The food and the furnishings are the same. Even the people are the same.  Jonas has a father who is a nurturer, one who cares for babies; a mother who is a lawyer, and an eight-year-old sister named Lily, a sometimes-annoying girl, who goes to school. Jonas has two friends: Asher, a mischievous and funny boy, and Fiona, a nice girl whom Jonas likes. There is Gabriel, a little baby boy who has been sleeping at Jonas' house to try and become a part of the community. Last but not least, there is the Giver, the former receiver, whose job is to hold onto the community's memories. He changes Jonas' view of the world, and becomes Jonas' best friend.  The Giver teaches Jonas a lot. He helps him to get feelings through memories in order to become the new receiver. He also helps Jonas learn more about the rules and history of the community.  One night, the Giver shows Jonas one of the rules of the community called &quot;Releasing.&quot; The only thing Jonas knows about releasing is that it is part of his father's job.  The Giver has Jonas observe his father perform the procedure on the Giver's television screen. Jonas gets extremely mad when he learns that releasing is basically murder.  He is shocked when he sees his father inject a deadly liquid into an infant.  After that incident, Jonas is certain that his community is not perfect. He thinks about how no one is allowed to have feelings and make choices.  The Giver and Jonas make a plan for Jonas to go to another community so that he and the rest of their community could have a better and different life by having the freedom of choices and feelings.  I think this was a really good book because it shows me a new view of the world. For example, it tells me that you shouldn't try to make a perfect world because you will have to give up important things like emotions and being a unique individual.  I give this book five stars as a rating because it was well written and very informative and detailed.  This book was very exciting, interesting, and fun to read. I recommend it to anyone from ten to adult because I promise you, the book will be a part of you, and you won't be able to put it down once you take a peek behind the cover!  Have fun!  END
B00004T8RK|5.0|Right away, let me say that this is a fantastic album. Matt Cameron provides the best drumming Pearl Jam has had in a long time, perfectly blending Irons' straight-ahead-ness with Abruzzese's chops. A very musical  drummer.<br />Some reviews have said that Pearl Jam is still searching for an  identity, but I feel this stems from a misconstruing of their goals.  Critics complain that there isn't an ear-catcher on this album, that the  band will never again scale the heights they did on 'Ten.' Come on. That  was ten years ago and they're not concerned with that now. They are in the  enviable position of being able to make uncomprising music that millions of  people will get to hear. Not many bands can say that. To me, 'Ten' was  great, but it was an aberration: Gossard and Ament's arena rock songs  coming together with Vedder's introspective lyrics. It will never happen  again, and while 'Vs.' and 'Vitalogy' were great, they often seemed forced.  'No Code' was a re-grouping, while 'Yield' found them hitting a stride once  again. Is 'Binaural' their masterpiece? No, but if 'Yield' found them  getting comfortable with making music again, 'Binaural' represents the  further refinement and maturation of that tone of confidence and  groundedness. Get over your feelings of superiority to a band that's taken  the hard road. Buy it and try to take it for what it is.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Within one week, i've realized i'm crazy about every track on this CD, a feat rarely accomplished. Best sounds -- &quot;Oops&quot;, &quot;Can't make  you love me&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction&quot;. Run, do not walk, to get  this one.
0375707972|2.0|I absolutely could not wait to read this book. As it turns out, I could  have waited all my life and not missed much. The Reader's premise is a very  intriguing story line with so much potential. Unfortunately, the outcome is  a disappointing and depressing book that leaves much to be desired. The  story develops in a very uneasy way. I felt like this story wanted to  almost stop itself from being told.  With all of the wonderful books out  there I am a little dissapointed that I spent my time on this one.
B000002BSV|2.0|I listened to this album for the first time with trepidation, as &quot;Suede&quot; and &quot;Dog Man Star&quot; are two of my favourite albums ever, and worried that the loss of Bernard Butler was going to be  fatal. Unfortunately, I found &quot;Coming Up&quot; shallow and forgetable.  After a few listens it becomes grating and I can't bear to listen to it  anymore. &quot;Saturday Night&quot; is the nearest thing to previous  glories but even that isn't quite there. Richard Oakes is just copying, and  I'm not sure what Neil Codling adds other than to the song-writing effort.  It hurts to slag Suede as they WERE one of my favourite bands and the first  two albums will always be special to me (and I went to school with Neil  Codling so it feels like I'm having a go at a mate) but really this album  isn't very good. Sorry.
B00004T9UF|5.0|If you are anything like me...you got a little worried the first time you saw Eminem and thought he might be the next Vanilla Ice. Well, if the first CD didn't alleviate your fears...The Marshall Mathers LP will definitely  convince you that Eminem is for real...and obviously sticking around. This  album is off the banger!
B00000J6AG|5.0|Ok, so you've probably seen the video or heard the song,  &quot;Bodyrock&quot; somewhere.  That is Moby.  But then, there is so much  more.  Actually, &quot;Bodyrock&quot; is a mere fraction of what you will  hear on Play.  This 18 track masterpiece is a mix of so much music,  something new is heard with each listen.  However, it is not so complex  that it is difficult to listen to.  Quite the opposite, this is one of the  few techno CD's one can completely enjoy all the way through.  Even the  word, techno, seems to insult the CD, because Play is so much more than  techno.  It is a collaboration of emotion from music into 18 beautiful, but  eclectic pieces of music.  Songs like &quot;Porcelain,&quot; &quot;Natural  Blues,&quot; and &quot;Everloving&quot; are simply beautiful.  Meanwhile,  &quot;South Side,&quot; &quot;Run On,&quot; &quot;Bodyrock&quot;and  &quot;Machete&quot; range from fun songs to blazing rock.  Treat your  senses to a complete immersion in sound and music that will reward you with  something new in each listen.
B0000214F0|2.0|The film lives up to it's reputation in the graphic sex dept. (we're talking hardcore sex), but the violence, while harsh, is not half as graphic as most people would have you believe (in fact, a little less sex  and a bit more violence would have made this film more entertaining).  It  is obvious where the money was spent (lavish sets and top-notch lead  actors), but it is also obvious where the money was not spent (poor  direction and sometimes hap-hazard editing).  While the film-makers tried  to show the decadence of Rome, the film only succeeds in assaulting the  viewer with scene after scene of heterosexual, homosexual, transgender and  mutant sex (yes, mutant sex!) interspersed (all too infrequently) with  scenes of graphic violence.  Caliguala even ends up in bed w/ a horse.   There is not a whole lot of stylistic visual appeal in this film either.   Instead, the film-makers just go for shock value, heading into Fellini  territory by populating the scenes w/ non-stop nudity and mutants.   McDowell gives an excentric performance as Caligula, while O'Tool seems to  be the only one having any fun as the old emperor Tiberius.  The rest of  the cast just drifts through the film till they are killed off.  The worst  part about this film is the fact that it goes on for 156 minutes!  Not a  great film, but certainly worth seeing once so you can tell your kids that  you saw the most notorious big-screen movie release in history.  Also makes  a great collectors item, since it is now on DVD.
B000002G7G|5.0|This album shows a mellower side of this band. &quot;Candy Says&quot; and &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; are two of the best songs that Lou Reed ever wrote. This album, had it been released after the first album, would have  probably opened them up to major popularity. Instead, it came after  &quot;White Light, White Heat,&quot; one of the noisest albums ever  released. This album deserves to be heard. It is the one album that is  overlooked.
0446310786|5.0|This book is excellent. I just finished reading it for class. I had always thought it was going to be a boring book but alas I was wrong! I think it's one of the classics and everyone should read it. It deals with racism in  the 1930's and a man, Atticus, has to defend an African American man  unfairly convicted of rape. Meanwhile his two children are finding out what  life really is like. (at least that's what I think :)  You have to read  this book.
B000002G7E|4.0|At first, I had a hard time listening to this album. It was very harsh sounding. After a few listens, I realized that this was just another masterpiece by this band. They went out on a limb, trying to break  themselves from the Andy Warhol scene. Had it been released later in their  career, nobody would have written this band off. As it was, it was their  second album and it alienated any possible new fans. That is sad. It's not  my first choice, but it is still one of my favorite's by this band.
B000001F6T|5.0|I'm tired of people saying bad things about Stonedhenge. I don't understand why so many people knock this album. TYA rocks, and so does Stonedhenge. I have many TYA albums and Stonedhenge gets played more than  most of them. I admit some of the songs like Ric Lee's &quot;Three Blind  Mice,&quot; doesn't do much for the album, but a few of the other songs are  some of my TYA favorites. I also happen to like Leo's bass solos. Whatever  you do, don't knock this album before you hear it, you may be pleasantly  surprised.
B00004T9UF|5.0|And this is the greatest album of all time. Every song on The Marshall Mathers LP is totally dope. Buy this CD, it is worth it.
B000002J1O|5.0|After 25 years of not really knowing Genesis I bought this album, then quickly got the other early ones.  Especially great through headphones or on a good car system.  If you only know the later albums then you DON'T  really know Genesis.  Great!
B00004T9UF|5.0|I've been listening to the CD for a few weeks now and I finally picked up the final album when it came out today.  The song &quot;Stan&quot; paints a vivid picture with the use of eerie samples and storytelling.   &quot;Kim&quot; and other songs are filled with Eminem's fury, showing rare  true emotion behind the music, and &quot;The Way I Am&quot; is simply one  of the best rap songs I've heard in recent times, even using poetic devices  in its very unique style.  Eminem has revived his entire genre from the  shallow, texture lacking likes of Master P and Sisqo.  He's the best rap  lyricist since Tupac Shakur.  I could not give this a better  recommendation... if you enjoy hip-hop at all, this is a must buy.
B000002J20|5.0|I've been a casual fan for 25 years but never heard this album - then I bought it and listened through headphones while doin Java programming.  Jon is heavenly - I'll possibly wear out this CD.  I cannot rate it highly  enough.  Just wonderful!  If you've been considering this CD - do it!
B00004T8RK|5.0|Every time I hear a new Pearl Jam album it takes me a few days to allow its songs to work into my skin.  Binaural is no exception.  But once this happens it is a great piece of work.  Don't buy it if you only want an  audio photocopy of their previous material, because this isn't a repeat.  It continues the tradition of the band's evolving sound.  There is  variation throughout the entire CD, so nothing gets old.  This is a very  tight band.  Hope to hear them on tour soon.
B00000K0DT|5.0|This film includes one of the finest actors of our generation, doing one of his best roles. It is a masterpiece.  Just enjoy it. watch it over and over.  Let it work it's magic.  You will enjoy it.
B000002J0P|5.0|This is an album you would want to take with you camping or on a nature drive.  All of the music has a warm feeling to it.  The vocals on the album are great, especially the harmonies.  My favorite tracks on here always  have been Wooden Ships and especially Helplessly Hoping.  One thing I think  thats interesting about Helplessly Hoping is how CSN makes the track sound  so full with only a single acoustic guitar to accompany them.  The album is  also fairly consistent, I usually only skip two out of all the songs when I  listen to it.
B00003CX59|5.0|I really liked this movie!  It had pizazz and also was very funny at times!  It was scary and johnny depp looked really good!  hope you enjoy the movie!
B000000OQF|5.0|These boys sure could churn out some nice gritty rock songs back then.  Axl is not a the most complex lyricist, but it is better that way.  However, he obviously was a decent musician and could write a good vocal  melody.  The playing by Slash on this is absolutely incredible.  All the  rythm parts (Slash and Izzy) are very active and energetic.  Add onto that  incredible guitar solos on almost every track on the album. (The solo at  the end of Paradise City makes Slash a demigod in my book, especially if it  was improvised) <BR><BR>  This record has to be hands down the finest  record to come out of the eightes.  It remains one of the few 80's-present  albums (with the likes of Soundgarden's Superknown and PJ's Ten) where I  could sit down and admire the entire thing without losing interest.  This  factor also makes it good music for long trips.  However, it is music for  younger people or maybe even those young at heart who wouldn't get turned  away by obscenity.<br />The band was in peak form at the time this was  recorded and have not scaled heights this tall since.  Even some of their  most popular songs from the Use Your Illusion Albums such as November Rain  and You Could Be Mine were written before or during this time period.
B000002HRE|2.0|As a stand-alone album this is competent enough stuff. But comparisons to  pre-Load era Metallica will leave the more established fan a bit  disheartened. Goodbye sweet riffage, you will be missed. Thank God Iron  Maiden is back, maybe James and the boys will get inspired again by their  New Wave of British Heavy Metal heros.
6305313687|5.0|This is one of those movies which i think should be played to every high school kid who has the stomach for it. <BR><BR> It provokes thought about human relations while entertaining at the same time.  There are exciting  and persuasive arguments all through the movie.  I personally liked the way  it did not present or try to present an easy anwser to the question of race  &quot;inequalities&quot; (there is no easy anwser), and made you draw a  conclusion and make your brain wonder about stuff for a few minutes.  <BR><BR> Try it out, it is the best movie I've seen in a while.
0062502182|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! In fact I would say it is my favorite book of all  time.  I've read it 3 times and will read it again still.  It is full of  lessons about how to live and enjoy life as well as how to deal with fear  and change. I highly reccomend this book to everyone.  I suggest reading it  slowly, the way you savor a fine wine.  Don't try to read between the lines  looking for the lessons, just let them work their magic in your life.   Everyone I know who has read it found the same magic in it that I did.   This book allowed me the freedom to face overwhelming fear and take my life  in an entirely new direction. I ended up writing and getting a book  published.  I am the author of &quot;Master Dating: How to Meet and Attract  Quality Men!&quot;  Thank you Paulo Colelho for writing this masterpiece  and doing what it took to get it out there.
0316777722|5.0|What can be said?  Truly one of the best story tellers around.  Yes, I've read a number of the stories in other places previously or heard him read them live (a treat unto itself) but I cracked up just as hard the second  time.  The new ones were hysterical.<br />Do yourself a favor and catch him  live.  The book was well worth the wait.  Outstanding.
B000002B82|5.0|My best friend and I loved this cd. We listened to it often. Every song we could relate to. When times were rough, we would listen and feel better about life. We could sing along to every song. Mama im coming home  especially! My friend pasted away on good friday, but the songs live on!
0716703440|5.0|I wanted to learn GR, and had to do it by myself. This book did it for me; it's clear, easy to follow, and does what I would look for in a teacher: it explains. I recommend that you acquire some knowledge of tensor calculus  before reading it, but the book will fill all the rest.

B00004T8RK|5.0|THE FIRST 10 TRACKS ARE INCREDIBLE!!!ESPECIALLY RIVAL,WHAT A GREAT SONG BY  STONE.  BEST ALBUM RELEASED BY ANYONE THIS YEAR.  ONLY DOWNFALL WAS  MCCREADY NOT WRITING MORE SONGS LIKE HE DID ON YIELD.  MIKE COULD HAVE  HELPED OUT WITH TRACKS 11,13 WHICH I FIND ARE A LITTLE WEAK.
B00004T8RK|4.0|As a big Pearl Jam fan, I liked the fact that they didn't just go out and do another Yield, even though I love that album. It was good to incorporate some of the basic rock that was done on albums like Ten and Vitalogy. The  only bad part is while the rockers are really fun when you listen to them,  they don't stick in your mind much after the songs are over, with the  exception of &quot;Evacuation,&quot; which is kind of annoyingly in your  head. While &quot;Light Years&quot; is a good song, it accentuates Eddie's  mumbling style, which he occasionally falls into. The mid-tempo &quot;Thin  Air&quot; is even better, with its carefree melody. The Middle Eastern  styled &quot;Of The Girl&quot; has exceptional playing that really makes  you feel like you are in the Middle East. &quot;Nothing As It Seems&quot;  has a bluesy melancholy to it that is very appealing. &quot;Rival&quot; has  a funk feel that will grab your attention. All in all, a worthy addition to  your PJ collection.
B00004T9UF|2.0|The last Eminem CD was quite a bit lighter and was a lot of fun.  This is  much, much darker.  There is a lot of murders, beatings, rapes and the such  in this CD.  Eminem went from party rap to gangsta rap.  I don't care for  this CD nearly as much as the first one. ...
B000002QWD|5.0|This is one of my essential Christmas albums. Many people have recorded  beautiful holiday music, but this is the best of the bunch. This album  highlights Crosby's versatility, with a mix of contemplative and  light-hearted songs. I can't hear it without smiling, and when I think of  Christmas I think of Bing Crosby.
B00003CWOL|4.0|This film is a wickedly irreverent lampoon of religion that holds a mirror up to the inconsistencies and absurdities of Christian biblical mythos, and more specifically Catholic dogma, by putting it in a modern context.  <br />It  is the story of two fallen angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt  Damon) that have been cast out of heaven and banished to live in Wisconsin.   With the help of their friend, the devil Azrael (Jason Lee), they discover  a loophole that allows them plenary absolution during a ceremony at a  Church in New Jersey.  If they enter this church, they will be forgiven and  be able to get back into heaven.  The trouble is that if they do this, God  will be proven fallible and existence will come to an end.  So Metatron  (Alan Rickman) recruits Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) who is the last scion of  Christ to help stop them from entering the church.  The rest of the story  is basically an action adventure/comedy sendup culminating in a  confrontation on the church steps.<br />Kevin Smith's story starts out razor  sharp, with biting intellectual humor that mocks some of the basic tenets  of religious belief, while simultaneously broaching some pretty deep  philosophical questions.  Unfortunately, as the film progresses, the edge  is lost and it degenerates into a slapstick action flick with occasional  returns to the religious allusions.  Overall, it was very entertaining, but  the story could have been so much more if it stayed on point with wry  intellectual forays, rather than degenerating into farce.<br />The cast was  delightful.  Matt Damon gets a chance to play a little less serious role  and brings an enchanting comic naivete to Loki, the former angel of death  and vengeance.  Affleck is the most intellectual and serious of the  characters, and it is his ability to stay sincerely serious in absurd  situations that makes him so funny.  Linda Fiorentino was terrific as the  Catholic girl who had lost her faith.  She had a wonderful abilityto  broach disturbing thoughts that almost all of us have about God and  religion, while maintaining a sense of mocking self doubt and comical  despair.  <br />Chris Rock plays the spiritual guide; the unheralded 13th  apostle of Christ.  He brings his usual ironic style and hilarious  assortment of facial reactions and steals more than half the laughs in the  film.  And then there were Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, once again  reprising their roles and Silent Bob and Jay (a trademark of Kevin Smith  films, he finds a way to insert these two characters into almost every  movie he does).  There were also bit parts for Salma Hayek, George Carlin  and Alanis Morissette (as God).<br />This is a entertaining film that missed  its chance to be a classic religious parody by losing its soul and going  off the deep end.  Still, if you have the ability to have a sense of humor  about God, there is a lot of good comedy here.  I gave it a 7/10.   Religious zealots steer clear.  This movie will either offend you or shake  your faith.
0743200799|4.0|In the book Coffee Will Make You Black, by April Sinclair, the lead character Jean  Stevenson, Stevie to her friends, tells in a narrative perspective of her adolescent years, growing up in Chicago in the 1960's.   The book is like Stevie's diary.  She tells you her experiences with boys,  girls, love, sex, popularity, school and racism in a comical and  to-the-point fashion.  The book is a quick, easy, fun read that hooks you  from the start.  It deals with very realistic issues that are fun and  interesting to read about.  The book makes you feel like you are part of  Stevie's chaotic life.  She gives you the opportunity to share her deepest,  darkest, secrets.   On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the book an 8.   I enjoyed reading it greatly, and finished it in one day.  I liked reading  it because it dealt with issues that I deal with.  It tells of Stevie's  hard times with boys, other girls, sex, love, popularity, which are all  important to me now as a freshman in high school.  It didn't take very   long to get into the book because the first page is a humorous anecdote  about a boy asking if 12 year old Stevie is a virgin.  Stevie, confused  with the meaning of virgin, goes home and asks her mamma.  The whole book  is little anecdotes like the one above so I liked it from the start.  The  book isn't very short yet the words and vocabulary are very easy and simply  written so stumbling over big words is not a problem.  Nothing very big  happens in the book, it stays rather monotone throughout.  Something I  found a little hard to understand was the slang.  Since Stevie is growing  up in the sixties in Chicago, there are bound to be differences in slang  but overall the read is easy.  It may be hard for younger people to read  this book because they might not get what some of the terms mean.     This book reminded me of many movies about teenage-hood.  Like American Pie  or Election.  I have never read another book by April Sinclair but I  enjoyed this book and will read other works by this author.  In class we  have reading groups where there are four groups of five kids and each group  reads a different book.  To decide which book to read the teacher read the  first pages of every book.  I enjoyed the first page so I signed up to read  this book.  Since the book is written from a females perspective, I think  that girls would relate and enjoy reading it more because it deals with  female issues. I can imagine a guy not understanding the complete intent of  the author.  The book is very funny so I think that the reader should have  a good sense of humor, and maybe someone that grew up in the sixties could  relate to an even greater extent.    \\" What does `coffee will make you  black mean mama?'  `The old folks in the South used to tell that to  children so they wouldn't want to drink coffee.  The last thing anybody  wanted to be was black.\\"'   This quote is from page 111 in the book.  I  chose this quote not only because it is obviously the line in which the  title of the book comes from, but because it also represents the feelings  about different races at the time.  I don't get why people ever thought  that darker skin made a difference.  Personally I think all racism is  ridiculous and that this quote is very interesting.  To think that back  then the children were told that in order to stay lighter they shouldn't  drink coffee is ridiculous.  It shows that back then they weren't proud of  their skin color and would do anything, like not drink coffee, to stay  lighter.  I wonder if maybe this saying was also to keep kids from just  drinking coffee.  Maybe they didn't want the children to drink too much  caffeine.  In any case being darker was the worst thing imaginable.  I hope  that this quote shows a little bit of how the book is written.  This is a  more serious moment in the book but I thought it was important.  I hope you  enjoy it as much as I did!
B00000099Y|5.0|What can you say about this band?  They are utterly incredible.  I would love to use all the same adjectives that everyone else has used (read: scary, depressing, sad) but I don't see it as that.  At most, I see it as  dark.  But like everyone has said, it's a journey, a journey that ends with  a question mark, and a blank space, that you must fill with your own  feelings. As for the intermissions...  I don't care about them.   &quot;Message to Harry Manback&quot; is GREAT... &quot;Dier Von Satan&quot;  is awesome if looked at from a different perspective.  It shows how simple  minded most of us are.  Anyway, GREAT CD... There isn't one that is better.   Bottom line.  Oh yeah, and being from Colorado, I ESPECIALLY love the song  Aenima :o)
B00004T9UF|5.0|This dude is one crazy [fellow], I tell you.  An excellentlyricist with questionable content, Em delievers on this albutm.Great skits (something rarely seen these days), engaging lyrics and a real chill factor - u feel marshall and his twisted mind.  Although I really believe that half of what he says is just for the controversy (and controversy sells), eminem is a tight mc who can do things on many different styles.  The CD lacked a bit of variety in content and the beats could have been better in some songs (but they kicked ass in other tracks like Stan) but the fact that eminem has such an amazing ability to put lyrics together (and in a way a bit different from other rappers), he definently deserves five stars.  Everybody has got to check the track &quot;Stan&quot; - it is off the hooks
0783117388|5.0|This show is always a highlight of my week - the clothes, drinks, hair, and sex are all fabulous, and the on again off again relationship between Chris Noth and Sarah Jessica Parker keeps the show moving, and the audience  guessing.

B00003CX59|5.0|I have a question about Sleepy Hollow (1999). I had just seen it for the first time and felt there was at least one error.<br />There were two young girls that saw the living \\"headless horseman\\" - one ran away, and the other saw the beheading. The girl that witnessed the beheading said that she \\"sold her soul to satan that moment.\\"<br />It is well pounded in my head that witchcraft has nothing to do with satan, but in the movie, satan and witchcraft were paired up once more.<br />I also found the clash between science and religion (Christianity) and paganism and religion interesting, i.e., the comment of \\"The only book you need to know is...\\" (WHAM) - the Holy Bible plopped in front of the constable.<br />Good movie, nonetheless.
B0000009SI|4.0|This was the first Zappa LP I ever bought, back in 1974 when itfirst came out. I heard &quot;Cosmic Debris&quot; on the radio anddecided that it was worth my $. Well, I certainly wasn't disappointed. It BLEW ME AWAY. This album inspired me to buy everything Zappa had out up to that point and within a year, I had done just that.   In retrospect, it's probably not his best, but there's certainly nothing horrible on this album, either. &quot;Yellow Snow&quot; is still a hoot; &quot;Stinkfoot,&quot; while a bit dated (if you're not old enough to remember the TV commercial Frank is poking fun at here, then you're missing part of the joke) still has a fantastic guitar workout, as does the title track, a jam between FZ, Jack Bruce, Jim Gordon and Tony Duran.  Plus, you get the incredible George Duke on keyboards--check out the fingerings on &quot;Uncle Remus&quot;-- and Ruth Underwood's million-miles-an-hour xylophone playing.   Note: if you originally bought this album on LP and you're looking for the same sonic experience on CD, be warned that Frank re-mixed portions of this album. This is most apparent on &quot;Exentrifugal Forz,&quot; which is so remixed it almost sounds like a different version.  This is a great album for the Zappa newbie. I highly recommend it!
B000005RST|5.0|The rhythm and music from this album is absolutely hypnotic.  It is excellent for meditation.  I've purchased four copies since it's debut in 1991.  It seems that every time I loan it to someone, I never get it back.
B00004T9UF|5.0|While the Shady LP was no Will Smith record, Marshall Mathers is the Anti-Will Smith record. It's by turn angry, snide, and sorrowful. The teenies rushin' out to buy it will surely hate it. Sorry, The Real Slim  Shady (which sounds like it belongs on the SS LP) is the exception here.  The Marshall Mathers LP stands as a glorious middle finger to everyone and  everything. My only complaint: why have censorship on the &quot;dirty&quot;  version? For instance, the masking of &quot;4 year old boy dead in your  living room&quot; in Kim.
6304078102|5.0|This movie was extremely well done.  Every aspect comes across as being carefully chosen-- the way the characters age through the movie, the emotion between various people, the lessons that are learned, the music  that is scored-- everything fits together perfectly to make this movie one  of the best I have ever seen.

0767817478|1.0|A series of nuclear weapons are tested in the South Pacific during the 1950's, and the film Godzilla moves swiftly and uninterestingly into the present as a shocked Japanese man (the only sign of Japanese involvement in  this Americanized adaptation) in a hospital deliriously repeats  &quot;Gojira, Gojira, Gojira&quot;. <br />As was the premise for the original  film, nuke testing has spawned a huge Gojira (Japanese for Sea Dragon). The  name is later adapted in the film as it was in the filmgoing market, to  Godzilla, a mere mispronunciation. <br />Doctor Nick Tatopolous (Matthew  Broderick) has been employed by the US military in order to help catch the  ship-sinking, fire-breathing creature with the piercing roar and not so  good looks. The lack of continuity is never more obvious than when Dr.  Tatopolous explains the creature with great aptitude, even before it stomps  into his life. From here, the film takes a by-the-numbers approach in that  the last three-quarters of it yields nothing but explosions, fire and lots  of stupid one-liners.<br />And who could resist babies!  Discovered inside a  now demolished Madison Square Garden, the nest with Godzilla's 200 eggs is  a mere walk down memory lane to James Cameron's Aliens.  Could there  possibly be anything original to look forward to after that? Don't hold  your fiery breath. Slews of rip-offs ranging from Jurassic Park to King  Kong fill the rest of this hype-vehicle of no-brain folly. Godzilla is at  best, remotely entertaining during the its 15 minutes. After which this  mammoth publicity stunt loses steam at record rates. You would think that  after creating such turkeys as ID4 and Stargate, the team of director  Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin (the awesome twosome?) would have  had enough sense to try to put out something commendable this time around.  But like in many things, there is simply no cure. Not since Starship  Troopers have I seen such bad visual effects, gratuitous violence and  paper-thin story lines. The characters in this film are so cardboard, they  belong in a police shooting range. Take a classic film and put it in the  hands of profiteers rather than filmmakers, and I give you the official  mascot for the worst movie since Waterworld.
1568496982|5.0|Wonderful short novel, a minor classic creating an unforgettable central character who can be viewed in a number of ways from positive and vibrant  model of freedom and spirit to very negative fascist-leaning self-absorbed  manipulator.  Everybody knows the film so no need to recount the plot.  I  was a bit surprised but not disappointed by the book's consistently  sarcastic, even mordant, tone.
0780619587|5.0|One of the greatest stories of overcoming obstacles, Shine is the pinnacle example of good old-fashioned tenacity and persistence in a world that stigmatizes the emotionally needy. Based on the life of Australian Piano  virtuoso David Helfgott, the film takes us on a journey of anger,  relationships, triumph and forgiveness from beginning to end.  After a  growing up with an abusive father and suffering a nervous breakdown,  Helfgott faces the struggle having been in and out of institutions for the  greater part of his life. Trying to piece his life back together he  rediscovers his talent and begins to realize the fact he has just as much  right to be happy and successful as anybody else. The storyline and  director keep the audience open-eyed until the very last moment where we  are allowed to witness the subtle but unmistakable climax. Geoffrey Rush,  who portrays the role of Helfgott during his adult life, performed all  music as seen (no hand doubles) and heard in this exceptional story of the  human spirit's capacity to overcome.
0780625129|5.0|I saw this movie a couple days ago, and I can't tell you how much I liked  it.

If you want a really good drama, then this is the one to buy.
6304806426|5.0|In the tradition of the great epics of the 1930's and 40's such as Gone with the Wind and Casablanca, the English Patient combines a diverse human story of love, war, strife and sacrifice to create a literary masterpiece  on the big screen. Set within a deserted villa on the rolling hills of the  Italian countryside of 1944, a horribly burned and disfigured man who known  to his nurse Hanna (Juliette Binoche) only as the English Patient, takes us  back in time when he was still Hungarian-born Count Lazslo Almasy (Ralph  Fiennes). But more than a count, mapmaker and explorer are on a mission in  North Africa until his place is shot from the sky in an all-consuming  fireball.   At a time when the need for Europeans to settle and create an  Africa of their own was still the science of Western government, his  bed-ridden state creates a setting for the revelation of thoughts spurred  on by demons of guilt and sorrow as slowly his memories of deceitful  transactions and betrayal on behalf of the highest bidder  (government)  begin to wash up their poisonous results. Willem Dafoe is David Caravaggio,  the thieving, thumbless Canadian spy, who is determined to lay open Almasy  for the deceiver that he is.  Nonetheless, Almasy's greatest lamentation is  neither over his work as an intelligence mercenary or his shocking physical  appearance. Instead, he is emotionally contorted over the loss Katherine  Clifton, played by Kristin Scott-Thomas. The desert cinematography of this  film is undoubtedly one to rival that of Lawrence OF Arabia and Anthony  Minghella's directorial talents have now established him as the as the  greatest director of epic narratives since David Lean (Lawrence Of Arabia,  Dr. Zhivago) and Sir Richard Attenborough (Gandhi, Shadowlands). The  English Patient has an ability like no other film to capture symbolism by  combining film, art (the Swimmers) and music to give birth to an  astonishing and bona fide human tragedy.
B000031XCR|5.0|Celine chose to say good-bye to her fans for personal reasons, by releasing this album/CD, &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot;. There was also a good-bye TV special by the same name.<br />This album/CD is a great  mix of old and mew songs. I picked up the album at first because I heard  the song &quot;Love Can Move Moutians&quot; was on it. I found that of all  celine's songs thus far, &quot;Love Can Move Mountians&quot; has had a very  profound effect on me. I cried when she performed the song on the TV Series  &quot;Touched by an Angel.&quot;<br />Another of my favorite songs on the  album/CD is &quot;Thats the Way It Is.&quot; I feel with this song Celine  is saying... &quot;Ok, this is the hand I was delt and how I have to deal  with it. That's the way it is.&quot;<br />Lastly, &quot;If Walls Could  Talk,&quot; one of Celine's best new songs on the album. This song speaks  volumes. A song with a haunting background melody that makes you think...  What would we do as a society, if walls could talk?<br />Celine is one of the  best! Her fans await her return. With this album/CD it would be hard to  forget who she is.
0790733226|5.0|The best science-fiction film of 1997 and one of the best of all time. Based on the book by the late Carl Sagan, this film examines the possibility of life on other planets and the means to make \\"contact\\" with  them. There is however an even more profound question this film ponders. At  the forefront of one of history's oldest battles are the two contenders of  science and religion. The story begins with Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster  in one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen on film) as a young  girl. As an extraordinarily brilliant child, she shows the making of a  scientist at an early age. The death of her mother and later her father  (both at a very tender age) only push her to explore the limitless  boundaries of the life/faith dilemma. As the film progresses, the  intermingling of science and religion become more apparent. After Arroway  receives what is believed to be a signal of life in outer space, she is  determined to go into space (at risk of death) to explore the origin of the  alien life. What follows before the flight is a plethora of red tape enough  to frustrate God. The religious community, from liberal to fundamentalist,  is determined to make its voice known to the world by apprehending Arroway  and convincing her that it is a question of faith and not science that life  exists. Enter cynic philosopher and Minister Palmer Joss (Matthew  McConaughey). His close relations to Arroway and his visibility on the  world stage create a fabulous breeding ground for conflict and make the  audience think hard about the dual truths and ambiguities of both religion  and science. In fact, the line between science and faith almost seems to  disappear at times. In the end, we are left to our own conclusions about  what is what, but not without feeling that science and religion have both  been given a fair shake. If you are expecting laserbattles and  intergalactic dictators on mega-spaceships, then Contact will certainly  disappoint you. However, ifyou are expecting to dive deeply into the  thought process and see a Sci-fi film, which is more on the philosophical  side with, many questions left unanswered (like 2001: A Space Odyssey),  then you are in for a great voyage into the unknown. The best thing about  this film aside from the material it approaches is the handpicked cast.  Aside from Foster, James Woods is remarkable as a starchy-shirt, bureaucrat  who refuses to bend to what he cannot see, Angela Bassett is the  open-minded and contemporary believer in the science community who is more  willing to accept Foster's story than anybody else. John Hurt is the  eccentric billionaire who is Foster's only real ticket to the spaceflight.  On a less powerful note, McConaughey is unable to make his role interesting  or even the least bit appealing. The only thing he can convince us of is  that he cannot deliver such a powerful character as his is supposed to be.
B00003CX7K|5.0|This movie engaged my attention with every scene.  More complex than the original, Toy Story 2 combines several subplots that add to the suspense but are still simple enough for kids to follow.  Watching the original will  help you understand all the jokes and relationships, but it isn't vital.   This movie takes the personification of toys to a new, surprisingly deep  level.  Most of us have had that special toy that we left behind as we grew  up, and we can sympathize with the toys as they are left behind.  We see  here the inevitability of growing up, but also the need to care for others  and enjoy childhood while it lasts.  I was suprised there weren't more  female characters in this movie, although a spunky cowgirl does figure  prominently into the action.  The voice work is superb, and the dialogue  sharp and entertaining - for adults, too.  (Star Wars fans will find the  mini-saga of Buzz Lightyear and his enemy hilarious.)  The computer work is  also new and improved, with more convincing depictions of humans (though  the faces still look a little cartoonish) and one very believable  hyperactive puppy.  Good clean fun, and a lot of it.
0767802551|4.0|In 1976, the government of the United States took on the Mafia in perhaps one of the greatest showdowns in crime history.  One man, Joe Pistone a.k.a. Donnie Brasco, sacrificed everything in his life including family  and sometimes sanity to become the FBI's supreme undercover agent. By 1982,  the work of Donnie Brasco would bring in not only about 200 convictions  (A  staggering amount by any standard), but would also bring down the most  powerful mob bosses in history up to that date (the fall of John Gotti was  still almost a decade away.)  Pistone/Brasco (Johnny Depp) is introduced  into the mob by passing himself off as a jewelry smuggler. Eventually he  befriends Lefty (Al Pacino), a mid-level mob hitman who takes Brasco under  his wing. As time goes by, Brasco makes connections with the high-ranking  officials of the New York Mafia by making himself visible and gaining their  trust by way of business and clout. After perfectly keeping up his act as  Donnie Brasco for more than five years, Joe Pistone, his wife (Anne Heche)  and children go into the witness protection program under which they still  live. To this day the Mafia still has a contract on Pistone's life for  $  500,000. Although there is some violence and interesting action, one thing  not to expect in this film is gun blazing, bloodletting action ala  Goodfellas. This film focuses more on the carrying out of operations and  relationships, which Brasco had to prevent from meeting on the same playing  field.

B00000K0EA|3.0|Pierce Brosnan returns in his second film as the suave and indestructible 007. This latest installment is the least chauvinistic (not saying much) and perhaps the most realistic (is that possible?) of the James Bond Films.  It's amazing how much writers can do with Anglo-Russian relations despite  the fact the Cold War is over. However, if truth were told, gunrunning and  mass media can be equally instrumental in disturbing the fragile peace in  today's political arena. Jonathan Price portrays Elliot Carver, Mass-media  tycoon, sorcerer of international terror, and Rupert Murdoch's villainous  alter ego. In his world of ultimate technology and remote control  relations, Elliot Carver plans to shake and stir the world into a panic of  mammoth proportions only the kings of the airways can orchestrate.  Calling  James Bond... calling James Bond...James Bond to the rescue! After several  vodka martinis and a car armed to its pistons, Mr. Bond is ready to take to  the street and to the casinos. Hong Kong film sensation Michelle Yeoh and  superwoman Teri Hatcher star as Bond's obsequious but fiercely independent  female counterparts, love interests and pain inducers.  It is always  refreshing to see new ideas in old-friends. The fact James Bond has been on  film now for almost forty years does not take anything away from Tomorrow  Never Dies. The idea of a media giant (Jonathan Pryce) taking over a world  already in a Big Brother mentality is not so far from the truth as were  some plans the previous villains had whipped up. The idea of being  conquered via one's living room is a far more tangible way of conceiving  ambitious bad guys. For all it's one-liners, chase sequences and gadgets  sold only at spy trade-shows (if there is such a thing), this Bond film is  more established in its story and \\"already on the map\\" stars such as Ms.  Hatcher and Ms. Yeoh, where unlike other Bond girls, had careers before  their 007 film, and will have them well after.

6305807086|4.0|Being John Malkovich is an original, funny movie full of plot twists.  The most interesting aspect of the film was the way it showed that Craig's talent in in puppeteering was a valid art form.   The movie begins with an  amazing puppet sequence where we get a glimpse of Craig's talent.  He is  misunderstood though, as he is ridiculed throughout the film for trying to  be a success with the art form that he loves.  Not until he is able to use  the notoriety of Malkovich, is he able to show the world what the artistry  of puppeteering is really about.<br />I think this is true in the real world  as well.  With all the different talents out there that people possess, I  think it's a shame that only a few are accepted and promoted by a mass  audience.  It's a shame that we will miss the work of talented people,  simply because their art isn't as readily accepted or paid for.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Check through the Amazon.com reviews and see how the \\"classic\\" 60's rock & jazz albums fare - dozens, occasionally hundreds of reviews. So, here we are faced with Santana's first, quite brilliant album with, as I write, a total of 7  reviews... 7 !... why ?...    With tracks from Santana's recent \\"Supernatural\\"  album receiving blanket international radio coverage, this record - which  provides the template for \\"Smooth\\" and virtually all other \\"latin rock\\"  dance music over the past 30 years - is in desperate need of some more  serious interest. Okay, it's less sophisticated but it's infused throughout  with marvellous songs and highly enthusiastic playing, and... it contains two  of the most infectious dance tracks ever made: I defy anyone to put  \\"Jin-go-la-ba\\" or \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" on their CD player and not get an  immediate, positive reaction regardless of age or musical preference.      Good enough credentials on their own to justify its inclusion on any  list of essential 60's albums. But there's more... because this is also an  important record! Not only did it catapult one of the world's most  distinctive guitarists onto the international stage but it re-asserted the  value of \\"good-time\\" dance music - the essence of rock & roll - at a  time when folk based introspection and heavy rock bombast were threatening  to take over. Playing tracks from this album, Santana's massive success at  Woodstock proved that generating simple \\"let your hair down\\" enjoyment was  still an essential ingredient in \\"progressive\\" rock.    As such, this album  fully justifies \\"classic\\" status and a great deal more  recognition - it'll also give you many hours/years of fun!
6305428298|4.0|Laura Hoff (Jane Horrocks) is a horribly timid and soft-spoken young lady, hence her pet name Little Voice.  So fearful and introverted is the gentle creature that she rarely ventures out of her house and into the world  outside.  Instead, she counts on the voices of such enchantresses as Judy  Garland, Marilyn Monroe, and Shirley Bassey as a sounding board for the  pain she suffers form having lost her father.  Living in the sleepy seaside  town of Scarborough, England with a repressive, pseudo-socialite mother,  Little Voice's grandest ability is to communicate by using her melodic and  unparalleled gift for singing, and finds refuge within her music as well as  her father's ever-present spirit.<br /> The day comes when a sleazy tavern act  promoter, a role that is splendidly delivered by one of England's foremost  actors, Michael Caine, suddenly discovers LV.  In an act of fervent  courage, Little Voice comes out of her shell and sweeps an audience off  their feet with her incredible stage presence, and her even more surprising  knack for flawlessly emulating the voices of her favorite sirens.  <br />Nevertheless, this film has an even more profound agenda.  Not only is  LV finally vanquishing her constrained sense of self, but also she has  finally begun to trust the another person other than her father's ghost, a  local boy who likes to look after his pigeons.  Ewan McGregor fills the  shoes of the small role, but he is one of the characters who has a more  profound effect on Laura &quot;Little Voice&quot; Hoff.  Furthermore, the  relationship between LV and her mother comes to its zenith when a fire  destroys their home.  The flare up is a momentous allegory for how LV's  rage will cause her to shed her old self and take on the life she was meant  to experience. <br />This picture is one of tumultuous family battles and the  struggle to become self-actualized. What I feel audiences will take away  from this film is the fact that the process of letting go is just as  important as that of grabbing on to the one thing which makes us feel  alive. <br />Let me also bring to the foreground that all songs were  completely undubbed and no lip-synching was involved.  In plain English,  Jane Horrocks genuinely performed and emulated all vocals that were crooned  in this film.  All the more reason to feel the force and craft behind this  zestful and rousing piece of work.

B000002GDJ|5.0|that's what it means. this is argueably their best ever work & there are a few reasons why i'm giving this 5 stars.<br />first, i don't think anyone, right up to that point, had ever played reggae like these guys did. free at once from the chains of emotional slavery guilt turmoil, these lads took this art form to a whole new level. sure, the clash, the beat & the whole lot of 2-tone bands were also dabbling with reggae, but these guys elevated this music form to a mesmerizing whole new level. it is for this very reason, & this reason alone, i think even now, this is one of the most under-rated rock/ reggae albums & their best ever work.<br />a lot of the sounds you hear on this album comes courtesy of andy summers & stewart copeland. the inventive use of the guitar & the speed drumming of copeland, made this THE album that represents the police at their best. this is reason no.2.<br />case in point. at the end of 'walking on the moon', the reverberating digital delay pedal work of summers, coupled with an almost computer drone like guitar feedback sound in the background, then the trance-like use of the drum cymbals (that's 5 or 6 notes in one second on the high hat to those of you who still think drummers are really machines), & sting's clever use of the human voice that floats over all of this & what you get is an incredibly trippy moon men chant, much like what you'll be doing if you are really on the moon.<br />& if you are still not convinced, there are 2 british no. 1s on this album alone. the anthemic 'message in a bottle', 'walking on the moon' & 'bed's too big' have been covered several times by jamaican reggae singers (a good cover can be found in dunbar & shakespeare's 'taxi').

B000023X9W|4.0|Silver &amp; Gold is perhaps Neil Young's most successfully modest album ever, which is not to say it's modestly successful. In fact, it's a masterpiece of understatement. Unlike After the Gold Rush, which Neil says  it resembles most closely in spirit, it contains no abrasive rockers in the  vein of &quot;Southern Man&quot; or &quot;When You Dance You Can Really  Love.&quot; Even Comes a Time, which to my ears is its closest relative, is  much more upbeat. The instrumentation on Silver &amp; Gold is minimalist  but very effective: an interesting use of a hi-hat here, soft bass there. A  better comparison would be Bob Dylan's John Wesley Harding, which employed  this kind of subtle accompaniment, so subtle you might not even be aware of  it. In both cases, this treatment is absolutely appropriate, a perfect  complement to the thoughtful, reflective quality of the songs, with  typically unforgettable melodies and acoustic guitar-work. And his sweet  voice is the rock &amp; roll equivalent of Nolan Ryan's arm, indestructable  and unchanged by the ravages of time. Any of these songs could be wedged  next to &quot;Don't Let it Bring You Down&quot; or &quot;Old Man&quot; and  fit right in. &quot;You really make my day, he sings, with the little  things you say,&quot; and that's what this warmly peaceful album will do  for you.

B000002BSG|5.0|Undoubtedly a true master of music, Jamiriquai brings you everything you could want out of a CD! His unique style of Jazz mixed with Dance sends you into a world of groovy romantic fantasy, with mind-fuzzing bass and  dreamful lyrics. The flourish of various instruments harmonizing into one  beautiful sound is enough to keep you excited every time you place the CD  in the player. There is only one word to describe this masterful album:  delicious!
B00000J7J4|5.0|I just came back from experiencing Santana live.  He performed last night in Zurich, as part of his Supernatural tour.  I thought his hit-record, Supernatural, was truly amazing...until I saw him play it live.  Then I  knew I was in the presence of a true legend.  To call the music compiled in  this album ethnic is misleading.  Yes, there is a distinct Latin rhythm in  many of the songs but even listeners who thought themselves enemies of  &quot;salsa&quot;, &quot;cumbia&quot;, &quot;merengue&quot;,  &quot;samba&quot; or African/Cuban sounds will find themselves drawn in by  the power of the music.  All listeners, connoisseurs or  &quot;Santana-newcomers&quot; alike , will be enthralled by the maturity of  the sounds.  Attempts to label Santana's masterpiece will fail. It is music  without frontiers.  Yet Santana remains true to his roots.  He has the  talent to play any type of music and be among the best; yet he chooses to  include Latin sounds in his songs.  That fills me with pride.  Last night  found me in second row screaming at Carlos, only a few feet away:  &quot;Viva America Latina&quot;, and hear him respond: &quot;That's  right&quot;.  He drove the mostly German-speaking crowd wild.  This record  is a must, not only for guitar-lovers, but for anyone who can appreciate  good music.

B00004STPT|5.0|What a joy to see Lisa Gerrard responsible with Hans Zimmer. for such a wonderful score even if the use of Holsts Mars shines through. coupled with lots of variations of other works by deceased composers. Lisa has worked on  other movies &quot;Baraka&quot;,[Dead can Dance} the &quot;Insider&quot;  Her haunting voice , with the Middle Eastern influence, and the amazing  vocal range, shows through on the gladiator score.&quot;Dead can  Dance&quot; have been a favourite band of mine and its great to see the  recognition for her work,after years of making great music with Brendon  Perry, just to also advise my USA friends, Lisa is one of us, an  Australian. and heralds from Melbourne, and we all love and respect her for  her artistic talents. Well done for producing an excellent compact disc,  the recording is one of the best I have heard in a long time, it demands to  be played over and over again. if you find this album boring or dull you  must be dead!

6301647734|5.0|An absolute masterpiece.  Enough has already been said about the magnificent and absolutely wonderful performances given by any and all of the main characters, and I wholeheartedly agree.  At the same time, I am a  huge fan of the supporting actor, those individuals without whom a picture  just couldn't come across as it was meant to.  In viewing this gem, watch  for what goes on around and &quot;behind&quot; the scenes, so to speak.   The mustached man sitting at the bar at the beginning is a fabulous  example.  As the scene unfolds, watch for this man's reactions to what is  going on around him---absolutely wonderful!  The lady singing at Veta  Louise's teaparty is another; when she gets to the lyrics &quot;Hop, hop,  hop, hop, hippity-hop,&quot; watch for Veta's wide-eyed reaction!  It's  hysterical!  Jesse White's portrayal of Wilson is another one to closely  watch.  His initial and then growing attraction to Myrtle Mae is  masterfully drawn and played out.  His interaction with and reaction to the  other main characters is hilarious.  Watch how the taxi cab driver reacts  to Elwood, especially when he reaches for the wrench in the  glovebox--priceless!  One of my all-time favorite scenes involves two  equally important supporting characters: Mr. Cracker, the Bartender, and  Wilson, the hospital strong-man.  As a fracas breaks out at Charlie's Bar,  Elwood calms everyone down, and then it happens:  Mr. Cracker looks at  Wilson and utters the unforgettable line, &quot;And any more trouble out of  you, Wisenheimer, and I'll butter your necktie!&quot;  They just don't  write 'em like that any more! Watch this glorious film, then watch it again  with an eye out for what's going on around the edges of center stage.   Classics are made up of ingredients such as this film contains, from the  first scene to the very last.  And, as has been said so well by others,  movies CAN be made without the use of foul language, nudity and sex scenes,  blow-em-up and gun-em-down violence, and terrible, horrible messages.   Harvey is a prime example.  What better message could we possibly come away  from this film with than to try our very best, every single day, to be  &quot;oh, so pleasant,&quot; following Elwood's recommendation?   Pleasantness seems to have nearly disappeared from our planet--let's follow  his suggestion and do what we can to bring it back!

The giver is the perfect book for mid age teens. Louis Lowry does agreat and good job of writing this plot and the setting is so awesome i think  that is a cool setting. The future in the story is very sellf explanitory  and same with the plot. I Wwould just like to say this is a great book that  my middle school class has read this year.

For the time period that both records were released they have done the same  thing, sell a lot of records and establish dre as one of the best 4 his  time.I would like to make a point Ice Cube,Snoop Dog,Eminem,The  D.O.C.,Eazy-E,M.C.Ren,Michel'e,and Dr.Dre.My point is that with these names  you could put 15 years worth of rap and R&amp;B's greatest hits, and it  could could easily be a double or triple cd box set. This record is tight.  I like the songs F*** you,Still Dre,What's the difference,Forget about  Dre,House wife, and Bang bang to name a few.The production on this album is  not only tight its creativly original. Coast 2 Coast this is must have for  any rap fan,This will be a classic.
0440219078|2.0|In the story The Giver, a boy, named Jonas, lives in a community that the  people think is a utopia, but he learns it is the exact opposite.  The  community is interesting because everything is chosen and done for you.   For example, your job is picked for you by a group of elders, and your bike  is given to you at the age of nine. At first, Jonas likes his community  very much because everything that is needed is provided, and he has nothing  to worry about. Then, he is selected to be the receiver of memory, the  person who keeps all the memories from different generations.  He goes to  the Giver who trains him and soon finds that his world is not so great  after all.    The conflict in this &quot;utopian&quot; world is that  Jonas wants everything his community does not have. He learns that there  are things called love, color, and music. He decides he wants to run away  and, in the process, breaks most of the community's rules. If Jonas is  caught, he will be severely punished. After successfully running away,  Jonas is miles down the road from where he began his journey and is  struggling to keep moving. Jonas sees a colorful house with people inside  who seem to love each other, and he hears what he thinks is music. Lowry  leaves you there to make up your own ending.    The Giver is very well  written, for example, the language that is used is not too advanced but at  just the right level for a sixth or seventh grader.  However, the book gets  into a slump in the very beginning and becomes very boring because there is  nothing happening in Jonas' life.  Even his escape is not very suspenseful  because whenever he is about to be caught, he uses a very dull strategy to  get out of the situation.  If you're looking for a book with a lot of  action and suspense, keep on looking. I would give this book two out of  five stars.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Don't tell anyone, but I have a real soft spot for sugar coated teen pop, so it was with great anticipation that I awaited the second opus from the reigning monarch of melody, Britney Spears.  Overcome your musical racism,  folks, this is a great album.  Her first effort was, singles aside, a bit  thin - but second time around Ms. Spears packs many zippy little numbers  into her alotted 48 minutes.  The first listen is a bit of a strain, but a  few spins later and you'll find an armful of winners shining through.  The  title track rocks (naturally), as does What You See (Is What You Get) and  the Backstreet Boys knock-off, Stronger.  However, this listener favors  Lucky, a perky ditty that guarantees a spot of the old toe-tapping.  Well  done, Britney.
0440219078|4.0|In The Giver, Jonas, a twelve-year-old boy, discovers the real truth about  his utopian-like community.  We don't exactly know where this community's  setting is, but we do know it has a different environment than ours.  It is  not like an ordinary living environment like yours and mine.  Why? Because  Jonas' community has no color, feelings, music, love, or even changes in  the weather.  In this isolated town, the citizens also do something that is  called release, which is when the community kills a person. All is not  negative though.  For example, one thing the characters get from being a  part of this society is not ever having to starve because their food is  delivered to the people's homes everyday. This book is about Jonas who  learns the truth about his community and wants to break free from it when  he sees his father doing something that is not the right thing to do.   Then, Jonas realizes that his life is not what he really wants, so he makes  a decision that will affect him and the community.   One thing you have  to think about when you are one of the citizens in this society is. . . Is  it worth it to give up things that you might want in your life for things  that you need? I, for one, don't think it is worth it to be in this  community because there are too many things I would have to give up, and I  couldn't handle that. The problem with leaving the community is to separate  yourself from this society which is a hard thing to do. Jonas leaves behind  friends, and most importantly, the Giver. The Giver is the most important  citizen because he is the one who takes away all the memories of the  society to make the community perfect. In the end, Jonas gets what he has  been waiting for all his life: a life with choices and love, an imperfect  society, but basically, a better life.  After reading this book, I feel  the message is to live the life of your choice as much as you can.  This  book isn't my favorite kind of book because I like more actions and  mystery, but it is well thought out and written, so I give it four stars.
1559408898|4.0|Who would have thought that a film with such a ropey premise (cop gets blown to bits, is turned into a robot) could become an unforgettable classic.  This potentially hopeless story was transformed by all involved  into an exciting, visceral thriller with a powerful human drama at its  heart.  Peter Weller somehow makes his iconic RoboCop character a touching  figure, conveying a degree of sadness through the armour and monotone  voice, especially during the scenes where our hero remembers his past.  As  can be expected with any Paul Verhoeven movie there is sharp humor, edge of  the seat tension and shocking violence in spades.  Jolly good.  On the  technical side, the unfortunately non-anamorphic transfer is a little soft  and smudgy for my liking but the sound is excellent.
B00004SCX6|4.0|THIS IS SOME GREAT DANCE POP! The title track was sort of a misstep music-wise because of its similarity to Baby One More Time, but it's still a solid track! Even though her voice isn't as powerful as Jessica Simpson's  or Christina Aguilera's, I find her voice quite pleasant, especially in  songs like Don't Let Me The Last to Know and Where are You Now, two very  well done ballads. If your a fan of dance pop I highly recommend it, songs  like Stronger and Can't Make You Love Me will make you get up and dance in  NO TIME!

0440219078|5.0|This novel, The Giver, written by Lois Lowry is an exciting, breath-taking book. It is well written, and it keeps you interested with the exciting things that are happening.  It is about a 12-year-old boy named Jonas who  discovers the true meaning of life. You see, he lives in a community where  there is no color or pain. Nobody is left hungry, and everybody is equal.   You might think it is a utopia, but the people have to give up a lot. They  have no love, no marriage, no originality, and no one can be the slightest  bit different. Jonas is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory, who  receives the memories of the past before the community went to Sameness,  and he alone can experience the pleasure and pain of life.  His father is a  nurturer who takes care of babies, or so Jonas thinks.  Actually, Jonas  sees his father kill a baby on video screen!  His mother works as a person  who enforces laws. Jonas realizes that he lives in no utopia and that he  lives in a totally separated society.  His society is separated from  practically the whole outside world.   He realizes that his community is  separated from the outside world from the memories he has been receiving  from The Giver.  He decides he cannot live without colors, pain, or  basically a regular world with real love, so he leaves the community and  goes &quot;Elsewhere&quot; to live in the pleasure of colors and weather.  That is an extremely daring move. You see, in his community, nobody is  allowed to leave their homes after dark. Also, he steals food. That is  dangerous because the night crew is right there watching him take it!  If I  were Jonas, I would do the exact same thing he did. I could not imagine  living in a society like that one. The Giver is a truly excellent book  because the plot is interesting, and the book kept feeding me with more and  more information. I recommend it to children ten and over because younger  ones might not get or understand the true meaning of the book. I give it5  STARS!
0515125024|4.0|As a Lee Child fan I am surprised by some of the negative comments in these reviews. Before you read Die Trying (or any of Lee's books) please be warned : THESE BOOKS ARE FICTION!  If you want factual accounts of FBI  procedures, read an FBI manual. If you can't handle coincidences in a  novel, how the hell do you function when they occur in reality?     Die  Trying is a thoroughly enjoyable action thriller, a work of FICTION. Jack  Reacher is a tough-as-guts, intelligent FICTIONAL character. For the love  of Pete, loosen up, people!
B00004T9UF|5.0|Who just happens to have hit it big with the &quot;MTV Generation.&quot;   This kid has skills to pay the bills folks.  It would be hard to imagine an  emcee of this caliber getting anything less than mad props, and yet this is  the situation Eminem finds himself in.  Many assume because he is white,  and because he has bleached hair, and because all the teeny-boppers love  him, that he is not &quot;Hip Hop.&quot;  Well if you assume that, you  would be dead wrong.  This kid has blazed the underground for years, and  now he is set to tear up the overground.  Forget the hype, forget the  screaming teens and all the MTV appearances - this kid is an emcee of the  highest order.  The beats are on point to boot.  <br />White, black or red,  Eminem IS hip hop.  If lyrical banging is what you want, then get your a$$  to Sam Goody and cop the album kid.  Dementia never sounded so good.
0140187537|5.0|This was my first Steinbeck novel. If this is not his best (as the critics say) then I can't imagine what the others will be like. This is easily the best book I've read this year. Excellent piece of writing. The events of  this book are in no way exclusively American, the message it conveys is a  global one.
B00004T8RK|4.0|This CD is a deserving member of any Pearl Jam fan's music collection.  It challenged me, like many of their previous offerings, to listen beyond my expectations and be open to a new experience.  After several spins, my  review is that Binaural is a very good new experience indeed.  The band's  music and lyrics have come together in a novel way and made me think about  what they've written.  And I appreciate provocative entertainment,  especially when it's genuine.  I recommend it whole-heartedly.
B00004T9UF|5.0|its got faster beats hotter lyrics, and maybe offending but its  the same old slim shady.  nothing changes and thats good. i love and u will too
B00003CWL5|5.0|Could be the best movie of 1999- And there were a lot of great ones last year. I will also say something even (possibly) bolder--that Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career. And all us movie geeks know that is  saying a LOT, given this  man's past roles, and his talent. I used to think  he was overrated as an actor. Then I figured OK, I see what all the fuss is  about. Now, he's up there with my favorite actors of all time, with James  Woods, Steve Buscemi, Robert Deniro...probably in the top 5. I was lucky  enough to see a free screening last September and boy, am I glad I had the  privilege...it's one of those movies that blows you away so much that you  have trouble even putting your feelings into words.  I rented it over the  weekend and loved it just as much upon second (and 3rd, and 4th, and 5th)  watchings. The plotline sounds trite when you first describe it (it did to  me when I first heard about it), Spacey plays a man who describes himself  as a loser, with Bening as his horrible, shrewish, self-absorbed, pathetic  b*tch of a wife. His daughter is not all that likeable either, despite the  fact that you can understand why she  turned out this way, with her as a  mother. Just when you think you've met the most dysfunctional family in  the world outside of &quot;Happiness&quot;, you find out about the family  who just moved in next door. At first, the  strange son seems like the most  messed-up member of their brood, but after you get to meet his ex-military,  abusive, homophobic, terrifying father and his withdrawn, sad, headcase  mother, you realize he  is the most normal member of the household by far.  Then, the filmwriters toss in Kevin Spacey's lustful obsession with his  daughter's sexkitten cheerleader friend, which trust me, is a lot more fun,  entertaining,  and amusing than it sounds when you read about it. Soon, he  is having the most entertaining, hilarious midlife crisis ever seen in the  history of cinema. He just doesn't give a ***k about what he does or says  anymore, and you only wish you could get away with doing the things he  does. I found myself laughing out loud in this movie so many times, most of  it horrified, amazed laughter at what was happening and the things that are  coming out of the character's mouths, especially Spacey's. He had at least  a dozen lines that had every member of the audience in hysterics and actual  applause and cheers.  I can't say enough good things about this movie. You  think, after the first five minutes, that you know how the movie will end.  Well, Spacey's opening narrative does give it away, but trust me, the  events unfold in a  way that you will NEVER see coming. You will swear you  can see what a character is going to do next, what  violent or  self-destructice act they will commit, but you turn out to be wrong.  Without getting too pretentious here, the movie lives up to it's  theme/tagline of &quot;...look closer&quot;. The characters are not what  they seem, up until the end, and even then they surprise you. At least two  characters  that you are POSITIVE you have figured out, do or say something  that turns all your preconceptions of them  upside down, while making your  jaw drop, and your heart ache. All the acting is stunning, but I honestly  can't imagine it being the same movie (or enjoying it as much) with anyone  but Spacey in the lead role. You will leave the movie with a smile, though,  and that is maybe what I expected least of all. Words just cannot do this  movie justice-See it for yourself.*k about what he does or says   anymore, and you only wish you could get away with doing the things he  does.

B000002U82|5.0|I love this album!  I own CD, vinyl, cassette, and special 20-year anniversary CD versions.  Floyd truly shot to the top of the progressive rock spectrum with this masterpiece.  &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Money&quot;,  and &quot;Us and Them&quot; are three of the 100 greatest rock songs EVER,  easily.  I still listen to this album late at night, a couple of times a  week.  &quot;Aqualung&quot; and &quot;In the Court of the Crimson  King&quot; helped set the early standard for great progressive rock, and  this album raised that standard tenfold.  If this is not part of your CD  collection, you're really missing out.  To top it off, they followed this  up with another great effort, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.
B00004SCX6|5.0|YES! She did it again!  This album is full of excelent songs that probe the talent of Brit My favorite songs are Oops I did it again, Lucky, Dont let  me be the last to know and Stronger. This is a must have  album
B00004RFDW|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from a &quot;based-on-a-true-story&quot; movie but  this was just plain amazingly well-done.  It wasn't just Al Pacino and his  intensity or Christopher Plummer and his eerie similiarity with Mike  Wallace (which I totally believed), but my God, Russell Crowe!  He gave an  amazing performance.  The subtlety of his expressions and that accent!!   Where did that come from?  This movie just shows the range he can perform,  from Neo Nazi in Romper Stomper to strong-arm cop in L.A. Confidential to  this quiet man who has the biggest secret in the world to tell.  If you  love an &quot;actor's movie&quot; this is totally your movie to watch.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is one thousand times better then Em's first CD.  If you expecting to hear songs all like The Real Slim Shady you are wrong.  The songs on this are so much more mauture and deeper.  But don't worry if you want the same slim...
0792153189|5.0|Of all of the disaster epics I have seen in my life, Deep Impact was the most moving and original.  I cried my eyes out, even when the sentimentality was over-the-top, as with the kid/romance subplot.  I  thought the emotional rendering of a core group of people you come to know  as the world is about to end was wonderfully done, and so movingly told.   Tea Leoni got a short shrift; her TV anchor was appropriately confounded,  disturbed and knocked out by the juxtaposition of her own success/ambition  coming about via the worst single disaster known to man.  The astronaut  sequences were well-done, and featured a small ensemble of strong acting,  lead by the reliable Robert Duvall.  It was refreshing to see Morgan  Freeman as a President you wish was your own.  James Horner's music moves  the multi-layered plot with deep emotion and color.  Though the movie  surely delivers knockout special effects in its final reel, this movie is  no Armageddon; expect a deep resonant response, one of the heart.  It makes  sense that this movie was directed by Mimi Leder; it has a woman's touch,  which for me brought it a sensitivity and compelling beauty.  There are so  many moving moments in the final 20 minutes it will be difficult to remain  calm, and dry-eyed.
B00004T8RK|4.0|They are back! The anti-commercial band of the 90's proves they are no joke.  Binaural, Pearl Jam's lastest contribution to the anti-rock era, is just what you don't want to hear, rock'n roll. For those of you who have  fallen to the consensus that boy bands are phenominal, this band is not for  you. But if you enjoy musical brilliance and exploration, then Binaural is  it.  The jam packed album is full of hard hitting tracks from Breakerfall,  Grievance, Rival and God's Dice to Insignificance and Evacuation; and for  those slow ones be ready for ol' Michael McCready to shread for us. And if  the music alone isn't enough for you teenie bopers, then maybe expanding  that mind of yours is. Lyrics on Binaural speak to everything from love,  Columbine, to the WTO riots and consumerism. No other present day rock band  does it all like these great legends do. And if you aren't ready for it,  move on, but if you are interested in listening to one of the few present  day bands that will be signin their names to the Hall of Fame wall in  Cleveland, then pick up Binaural, just another chapter in a the life of a  band that our kids will google over.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Yo you guys if you don't have this cd yet you need to get it if you thought he was over the edge on last album he totally jumps over the line on this one and I love it.  I like the way he makes fun of Insane Clown  Posse and boy bands and everything just buy the album it is worth it
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album was produced with exellence.  The detail with the sound effects, and, special guests are awesome.  I recommend The Marhsall Mathers LP album to everyone i know.  And i recommend you buy it to!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is just as good if not better then the first album.The best song is stan,its about a fan who goes NUTS!The hook is tight and has a phat beat,like all the other songs on it.By far he melts vanilla ice like  cilicone.
B00004T8RK|1.0|Its very simple....this is not PJ. I dont know who this is.  Fans will try to defend this by saying things such as&quot; they're growing&quot; or &quot;not afraid to break barriers&quot; or other silly excuses.  Simple  put...this stinks.  I will grant you that I cannot compare this to another  sound I've heard...maybe some remote Pink Floyd, with a touch of the Who  before they were good.  For me the real test to any piece of music is  this:<br />When your driving on the highway, and a tune comes on.....you want  to turn up the volume.  Its that simple.  And this album, all I want to do  is press mute!
B000002ADT|5.0|Like many listeners, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; was my introduction to jazz music.  For years a rock fan, then later interested in the great singers like Sinatra and Fitzgerald, I decided to try some pure jazz, and of course  &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; was recommended by every source.  Six months  later, I consider myself quite a jazz fan mostly thanks to this CD.  I've  picked up several classic productions by the likes of Coltrane, Baker,  Rollins, etc., but none really compare to &quot;Kind of Blue.&quot;  I find  myself wanting to listen to it at least every other day, slipping other CDs  in between.  The music on this CD seems like a leap ahead; the sound is  excellent on the re-master, and the melodies get into your head so quickly  that you'll think you've been listening to it for years.  To me, this is  the very definition of cool jazz, but its not just background music by any  means; it begs to be listened to seriously and where you can let the sound  surround you.  Mellow but uplifting.  I think that anyone who could  conceive of and actually put down such a perfect suite of music would be  satisfied to rest on their laurels forever.  As a long and devoted listener  of popular music, I can say that I would never be without this CD.  This is  music as good as it gets.
630512762X|5.0|&quot;Wow&quot; is the only word to describe &quot;Face/Off&quot; an awesome action thriller with jaw dropping action scenes. Unlike most action movies &quot;Face/Off&quot; has compelling and intresting characters that  aren't one dimensionial. The performances from John Travolta and Nicolas  Cage are top notch, and the direction from action master John Woo is  nothing short of briiliant. The action scenes in this movie are so fast, so  kinetic that it leaves you out of breath and wanting more. Action movies  don't better than this, don't miss it.
B000000OAL|4.0|If you have never heard this debut album, you may well be surprised at how raw it sounds compared to other Queen work. Certainly, there is much more band and less producer here. For a debut album, it is very accomplished  indeed. No weak songs and no filler.<br />&quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; and  &quot;Liar&quot; are my personal favourites but I'll happily listen to  every song on this CD over and over again.<br />The CD shows up some  limitations of the original recording in terms of levels of noise but this  is not uncommon in recordings from so long ago.<br />The re-mastered issue of  this CD contains the usual batch of bonus tracks but in contrast to some  other releases, there is some material worth having here.<br />The first extra  track, &quot;Mad the Swine&quot; is a pretty weak song but it is  interesting as it was the one song left off the album originally and it is  not otherwise widely available.<br />The second version of &quot;Keep Yourself  Alive&quot; is an interesting treatment of the song, the band members  certainly sound as though they are enjoying themselves here. Everyone seems  to be putting a little more into the song.<br />I'm not normally a great fan  of remixes but the last bonus track, the remix of &quot;Liar&quot; is good  and improves the song rather than just demonstrating the tricks available  at the mixing desk.
6300213668|5.0|&quot;Grease&quot; is one of those rare, special movies that you can watch over &amp; over &amp; over again, and still love it.<br />Olivia Newton-John is great as the sweet, innocent Sandy, while John Travolta is perfect as  cool-guy Danny.<br />The whole movie is witty, funny, and there is music to  suit all themes during the movie.  Sure, the movie is over 20 years old,  but it is also a timeless classic, and there is not one person I know that  does not like this movie.  Who could hate such a wonderful movie anyway?
0446310786|5.0|I just finished reading To Kill a Mockingbird and found it both gripping and moving. I could not put it down. It is said that &quot;it's a sin to kill a mockingbird&quot; because mockingbirds don't hurt anyone, they just  sing for you. This title and theme is weaved throughout the novel: when  Scout is about to kill an insect and Jem stops her because &quot;it's not  bothering you&quot;...when Tom Robinson is on trial and his self esteem and  his humanity is killed by the ignorant members of the towneven though all  he ever did was help people..and finally the resolution of the story  surrounding Boo Radley.<br />This is a fantastic read. I recommend that  student take the time to read it instead of renting the film because it  isn't hard to get through, the language is very straightforward and you  won't find yourself frustrated and tearing your hair out (especialy if you  dislike reading).
0930289528|5.0|One of the most chilling phrases of the last hundred years is, &quot;It couldn't happen here.&quot; Which essentially makes the terrifying future portrayed by V For Vendetta all the more possible. <br />V For Vendetta is set  in Britain a decade after a limited nuclear conflict, which thanks to the  Labour party removing American missiles from British soil ensures that  Britain is not targetted. However the climatic conditions caused by the war  end up plunging England into famine and chaos. One party promises an end to  anarchy and a return to order, 'Norsefire'. <br />They are supported by  desperate citizens. After they gain power they round up all the blacks, all  the asians and gays, all the beatniks and radicals... and kill them. For  their belief is in a unified uniformity. Orders are given and followed, no  deviations, with a little (very little) bread and circuses thrown in for  measure. The horrible absence of any faces other than white faces and the  eradication of all culture seen as unfit really shocked me. Moore has  always been concerned about Britain's tabloid press and its undercurrant of  racism and 'moral values'. It is a concern I share. At a time when hatred  for asylum seekers is being whipped up to new extremes by the far right  press this is a timely warning. <br />In this nightmare Britain about four  years after the 'final soloution' a terrorist begins to wreak havoc in  London. He wears a Guy Fawkes mask and calls himself 'V'. He is after  blood. Who is he, or more importantly, what is he? V begins a struggle for  the heart and mind of England, a heart and mind that have become complacent  and corrupted under the horrible 'better the devil you know' complacency  that we are sadly famous for. It is however ordinary people who will decide  this conflict, he has just to show us the way.<br />This is one of the most  chilling and enthralling books I have ever read. One of the biggest points  of the book is that most people don't want to be evil, but they will go  along with it if it leads to a quiet life. This view is hammered home  relentlessly. It also incredibly manages to be a ripping yarn at the same  time. The look and style of a future Britian under a totalitarian  dictatorship is wonderfully rendered by David Lloyd who draws everything in  a wonderful gritty, harsh, sleezy style. This is arguably Moore's greatest  work, it is certainly his most vicious and pointed. An important thing to  take into account though is that Moore was primarily directing this at  English audiences, the comic only got an American distribution later. As  such there may be several cultural characteristics that may cause to the  unfamiliar reader several vicious points to fall short. No matter, this  book was intended to show Britian how it could happen here, and by  implication how it could happen anywhere. Do not be complacent. England  prevails!
B00000J7S8|5.0|Diana Krall is a phenom!  I want to say &quot;this kid&quot; is terrific.  She reminds me of Peggy Lee with  that sensuous sound and marvelous rebato, so cool, so come hither...throw in a little Ella, some Astrud Gilberto, a  bit of Sarah, and even Doris Day.  (I notice that Diana included a tune  that Peggy Lee wrote on her &quot;Love Scenes&quot; CD.)  The fact that  this is all done while accompanying herself on piano makes it all the more  amazing.  The Johnny Mandel arrangements are lush and as individualistic as  we remember from the Frank Sinatra recordings.  He can transform you into  romantic mush with a quick stroke of his arranger's brush.   He's genius!   What a wonderful sound!  On some takes, such as &quot;Popsicle Toes&quot;,  only the quartet is used.  That tune makes you smile...helplessly.  I can't  think of anyone  else around today who could do so much with that clever  little ditty.  The first cut, &quot;Let's Face the Music and Dance&quot;,  just knocked me out, and I listened to that CD for hours,  uninterrupted...<br />Never heard &quot;The Best Thing for You&quot; before,  and I'm sure glad Diana included it, because it's a keeper, so upfront and  smart.  She adds just  enough spunk to it to keep you grinning all day or  make you sing it to your lover...or a lost one. And, if you think only  Sinatra could sing, &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot;, you're in for a  real surprise.  This fabulous CD makes my day better, and I can't wait to  put it in the car player and slowly head on home every night.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This Cd is the best out right now.  The marshall Mathers LP is 10 times better than his first CD which was The Slim Shady LP.  I think that everyone should buy this Cd.  It is well worth it. The funniest parts is  when he disses his mom.  You gotta hear this.  B-please 2 is a wicked song.   In the song is snoop, dre, xzibit and nate dogg.  This cd is a 10 out of  5.  Buy this cd right now.  Slim is the best white rapper ever.  Peace out  homies.

B000031WD9|3.0|American Pie is not a brainless comedy and it isn't an epic either. It's a movie about teenagers sex life and how they \\"do it\\". The story is about four guys who are desperate to lose their virginity. They agree on a pact,  to lose their virginity before they graduate high school. But the road to  \\"freedom\\" isn't quite easy as they expect.<br />I should say that a comedy  like this one isn't for everyone's taste. Especially the unrated version,  the version I saw. There's more explicit shots of Kevin and the mug  containing the \\"pale ale\\". There is a completely different version of the  famous pie scene. There is more seconds of Nadia moaning. I won't get into  details on those scene, you have to see it for yourselves.<br />The DVD is  full of amusing extras. There's an outrageous funny commentary by its  directors and casts. There is some funny outtakes and bloopers. And full  biography of its cast. And thing I love about Universal, is there are  trailers of other movies. If you want to know if there's a trailer of Man  On The Moon, this disc is for you.
B000000XB9|5.0|If you \\"just hafta\\" rock `n roll, like your rock `n roll raw, gritty, and with excellent and sometimes powerfully relevant lyrics, this is the CD to own.  It contains nearly all CCR's greatest hits, and the ones  that aren't on this CD can be found on \\"Chronicle, Volume  2.\\"<br /><br />As hard as it is for me to pick one song on this CD as a  favorite, (they're all that good,) I give a nod to \\"I heard it Through  the Grapevine,\\" a remake of the Marvin Gaye classic.  It combines a  great blues vocal arrangement with good, hard-edged guitar playing,  and  drums that will \\"roll your socks down.\\"<br /><br />This CD proves two  things:  60's and 70's rock ROCKS, and Creedence Clearwater Revival still  rules 60's and 70's rock!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This new Eminem Cd is awesome.  Cool lyrics + phat beats= a really good album, which is what this album is. From The PSA 2000 to Criminal, this cd is PHAT!  You should go pick it up!  All of the songs are good, but the  best songs are 2,3,7,8,11,15,16, and 17.  This is album is really done well  by Marshall(Eminem) and it is just as good as the Slim Shady LP.
0790729628|5.0|I first saw this movie in its original Version in 1984.( I was a part of the Atari/Commodore 64 era then,) and I was very impressed by all the visuals I saw. Back then story didn't matter, but the special effects were  truly amazing. It holds up even better in its new format. The Narration and  ridiculous &quot;Happy&quot; ending were removed( I didn't think they  belonged either.), and the result is pure genius. The story takes time to  digest, but to me dosen't really matter as the pace works slow , but really  well edited and made. This film actually has 5 different Versions that were  created over a period of years, and if you want to know more, a great book  on the subject is: Future Noir: The making of Blade Runner by Paul M  Sammon. Very Comprehensive, with some neat tidbits about the film, even you  didn't know. Like the Electron Microscope Image of the &quot;snake  scale&quot; DEckard gives to the woman at the shop to analyze is actually a  Electron Microscope image of a Female Marijuana plant! Kinda neat , huh?  Enjoy this movie it is really great!  Have A better one!
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido is from near london, England, and her brother is Rollo from faithless. Her debut album, so far unreleased in the UK because of label problems, is a fantastic collection of songs. For me, Don't Think of me,  Hunter and Here With Me stand out, but there are few if any weak songs.  Also, look out for Eminem's new album- it samples Thankyou by Dido on a  song called Stan. All in all a fantastic album, which bodes extremely well  for the future. i just hope she comes to play in England soon.
067158037X|5.0|Is there anything better than Frank McCourt's book, ANGELA'S ASHES?  ***YES! ***  Frank McCourt reading ANGELA'S ASHES.  Every syllable he speaks says &quot;Ireland&quot;.  McCourt's voice is that of a master  story-teller.  He intones every humorous tale, every tragic account as only  the man and boy who lived through all of it could.<br />Buy this audio book!   When you're done listening to it, lend it to all your friends.  You'll  never regret it!
0345350499|5.0|I am new to Arthurian legend, but realize that this book portrays an alternative view to the stories. Personally, I enjoyed seeing things unfold from female eyes, and experiencing the depth given to the female  characters. I don't think it was too feminist/preachy as another reviewer  mentioned, but if you're that sensitive to those undertones, skip this one.  I will allow that the author seems judgmental at times; I guess we all have  our favorites! I recommend reading this book; I plan to again. Very  engrossing, especially if you're interested in the changing religious  themes of this time.
0553277472|5.0|Excellent book.  Beautifully written.  Because of this book, I am now a zen practitioner.
0451196716|5.0|The Long Walk has got to be one of Stephen King's greatest short story accomplishments, up there with the highlights of the Skeleton Crew.<br />The story is about an endurathon contest, where 100 boys just start walking,  and if any competitor falls under 4 miles an hour, he is issued a warning.   However, if a competitor slows down to under 4 miles after receiving 3  warnings...he is shot dead.<br />King introduces many unique characters to us,  and we begin to almost feel their personalities, and the annoying little  habits that they have.  King does a masterful job of removing some of the  characters from the story with not much detail, really placing an emphasis  on the mental drain that is occuring with the competitors in The Long Walk,  they are so tired they dont even notice how or when some of their friends  are being killed.<br />The final surge towards the end of the walk is written  quite ingeniously, and is even quite surprising.<br />Overall, I would highly  recommend this short story.  ALthough the book may be about an endurathon,  it is certainly not an endurathon of a read, the pages will just fly by.
0375420525|5.0|Ask yourself why you are here.
B00004T9UF|5.0|His last cd was the best in the world.  But not anymore, his new cd is a 100 times better.  If you liked his last cd (Slim Shady LP) you will definetly love this one.  If i could give it anymore stars i would, so buy  this cd right now!
0743200799|3.0|In Gene Krantz's book you do get an interesting depiction of life behind the scenes during all of NASA's spectacular successes and failures.  His writing technique is the limiting factor that prevents this book from  really grabbing the reader.  The other problem is the alternative sources  of information concerning the period particularly The Right Stuff and  Apollo 13.  Both these vehicles have extensive viewership (and readership)  and have set the standard for the dramatic nature of NASA storytelling.   <br />This book did contain some fascinating details on the &quot;seat of the  pants&quot; flying the NASA team did, especially on the earlier missions.   However, because the writing is so mechanical it was very hard to get  emotionally attached to any particular person or persons in the story (even  the austronauts we already know).  This situation is created by Krantz's  effort to tell us EVERYTHING that was going on during the missions (a most  difficult task).  One example of this is the stories he tells during Apollo  13.  This most dramatic of missions has been burned in the public psyche  through the movie.  Yet the two most dramatic scenes (the creation of a CO2  filter and the simulation of CSM power up) are given only two paragraphs.   <br />The only other quibble with the book is the marked lack of disagreements  among the staff across all the years (there were only two in the book).   Now I realize that Krantz believes in Mom and Apple Pie, but it would have  been interesting to see some of the dirty laundry.<br />All in all this is an  enjoyable read especially for technical people and those interested in the  space program.  It is a great history of some amazing achievements in our  country's history.
B00003XB8K|3.0|I was actually pretty disappointed with Enigma's latest album.  SCREEN BEHIND THE MIRROR had the potential of being a great album, had Cretu, et.al., chosen to leave out the vocals.  In my opinion, the vocals give the  album almost a &quot;cheesy&quot; tinge.  Had the album been purely a  melange of electronic and sampled operatic music, SCREEN would've been a  wonderful album as a whole to listen to.  Don't get me wrong; there are a  couple of very good tracks.  Track 2, Push the Limit, does just that--it  has a very surreal, film noir feel with an outstanding back beat.  Unfortunately, Track 3 continues with an annoying female voice singing  something pseudo-moralistic, something about the Gravity of Love.  It would  have been a better track had she been left out and Cretu embellished the  operatic chorus, which is relegated as backup vocals for the woman's voice.  Track 5, Modern Crusaders, is painful to listen to because of the man's  singing--which is not that great, to say the least.  Same is true for  Silence Must Be Heard, Track 11; leave out the singing, and it would've  been a fine track.  Unfortunately, Enigma has fallen into the mainstream  pit, and with the SCREEN, is trying to repeat the success they had with  their hit &quot;The Return to Innocence.&quot;  By doing so, they're music  suffers. Enigma's MCMXC.AD and Enigma 3: Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi! are  far better albums than THE SCREEN BEHIND THE MIRROR.
B000000OU4|4.0|this album has a distinct R&amp;B/pop feel to it... very different from anything else PMG has done..  <br />for the most part it works quite well however.. particularly on songs such as &quot;Here To Stay&quot;, &quot;And  Then I Knew&quot;, &quot;To the End of the World&quot;, and &quot;Red  Sky&quot;. <br />As a past reviewer said, this is a good album for someone who  hasn't heard PMG before to get... the songs here should appeal to many..  not just PMG fans alone.
B000002UC5|4.0|McCartney's solo debut is woderfully simple, yet sonically sound.  It has a raw feel similar to that of 'Let it Be', and has stood the test of time much better than other albums from its era.  I highly recommend this, for  it is one of the best McCartney albums.

B000002MTU|5.0|This is an album done by a Clapton,inspired on that early years of the blues roots! Some said that it's an ugly blues album,but it's an EC album,an EC paying a tribute to that old musicians that inspired him,to  pick up a guitar and play this kind of ugly rooted blues! An authentic  Clapton's conceptual blueswork.I've understood that....rightly!
B000002U82|5.0|It's quite famous, been heard round the world, this strange record. The steady heartbeat growing louder and louder; the hysterical laughing prominent in the near background; the ringing cash register; the voices; the mad screaming as the beating heart becomes unbearable. \\"I've been mad for f*****' years,\\" states one succinctly. \\"Absolutely,\\" comes the dark reply, as if insanity were a prerequisite.<br /><br />Welcome to a more sinister side of the moon -- Pink Floyd perfected.  Nine practically nameless songs, written by faceless lads who had zero benefit of MTV and Web pages to spur sales. Great tunes stick around, however, and these songs will last a long time yet. \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is Pink Floyd at a very creative and ambitious point in its career, a moment when the band truly worked as a four-piece. Credit engineer Alan Parsons for excellent, atmospherically created sound quality and studio know-how. Top-notch singing and melody by Richard Wright and [[ASIN:B000ELJBAK David Gilmour]], along with increasingly astute and observational lyrics by Roger Waters, also make this record sensational.<br /><br />All prior Pink Floyd albums naturally led to \\"Darkside's\\" fluidly atmospheric and conceptual nature; afterall, practice makes perfect. Lush arrangements mixed with occassional insect-like sounds make this album hard to ignore. Waters' monopoly on lyrics began with this record, as he contemplated the fleeting passage of time, the folly and sadness of war, mortality, money and, of course, madness.  The madness is the best, most intriguing aspect of \\"Darkside,\\" partly the result of off-the-cuff remarks made by interviewees whom Waters smartly recorded. Asked such bizaare questions as \\"When was the last time you were violent?\\",  Waters captures some truly rambling gems. Paul McCartney himself was interviewed, yet his philosophizing proved too dull to make the cut, especially when compared to roadie Pete Watts and Abbey Road doorman Jerry Driscoll, both of whom remained blunt and frightently honest. Who knew their curt British voices would last so long and carry so much weight? The bleak doorman Driscoll sums up his feeling on life the best at the end of the record: \\"There is no dark side of the moon, really.  Matter of fact it's all dark.\\"<br /><br />Hearbeat fadeout.nd frightently honest. Who knew their curt British voices would last so long and carry so much weight?

B00003CX5A|5.0|This is one of those films that must be seen in the theatre in order to appreciate the beauty of the art direction.  I have seen the DVD and it is just as wonderful!  Tim Burton has created an animated painting that is, in  my opinion, one of the top five films of 1999.  He has reworked the classic  story of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow into an action-packed who-done-it that  is a dark, brooding, gory cinematic masterpiece. 5 out 5!
B000002U9Y|3.0|Syd Barrett is mostly absent on Pink Floyd's second album, and so is any semblance of melody. In contrast to the Barrett-dominated Pink Floyd debut, \\"Saucerful\\" is a much duller affair. Though the band retains its psychadelic aura, it seems all the fun went out with Syd. Still, this sophomore effort nicely captures the direction Pink Floyd was heading in, and does contain some good moments. Roger Waters' songwriting fares better this time around on the lyrically academic \\"Let There be More Light\\" and the super-quiet \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun,\\" where Waters' lulling voice is equal in volume to the muted drum sound by Nick Mason. Keyboardist Richard Wright also takes a crack at a few songs, longing for his childhood innocence on the ridiculous \\"Remember a Day\\" and the horrid \\"See-Saw,\\" where the lyrics are so baffling and stupid, even Wright admits the song was awful. Still, Wright should be commended for some of his work on \\"Saucerful,\\" since his tinkling piano was at times poignant and even hymnal on the best portion of the drawn-out title track, toward the end of the song. And what a relief it is to actually hear a Syd Barrett-penned song at the end of the CD. \\"It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here,\\" he begins in a sad, snubbed tone. In contrast, Barrett's \\"Jugband Blues\\" is lighthearted relief, especially when the Salvation Army Band simply plays \\"What they wanted,\\" as instructed to by Barrett. \\"Jugband\\" sharply cuts off at some point, when suddenly a pleasant acoustic chord softly chimes in and Barrett sings his last two lines ever with Pink Floyd: \\"And what exactly is a dream? And what exactly is a joke?\\" he questions plainly. It's a spooky moment, and kind of a downer. After Barrett's departure, Pink Floyd moved on in a big way. Yet this album, despite encapsulating Floyd's future direction, doesn't match up to future efforts like [[ASIN:B000002U8G Meddle]].
0792842723|4.0|I love Brosnan as Bond!   As usual, beautiful women, good action.  It could have been better at times, but I would see it if I were you.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I think this album rocked.  I cannot stop listening to it.  Lucky is my favorite song and has a great sound.  It is so so sad how much people cannot appreciate her for her music and have to trash everything else about  her.  If you liked the first album then you should definetly buy the  second.  Britney Spears is an amazing vocalist and artist.
630420065X|5.0|This is a great action movie.  It is a well written script that keeps you intrigued.  Tom Cruise and the gang does a good job on acting.  But perhaps most importantly, the action scenes are easy to understand and exciting.   The whole movie fits together very well.
B00003003R|3.0|I just got this CD last week and have listened to it a few times and have found it to be pretty good.  The problem I have with it is due to to Mr Rose's continual use of foul language.  Come on, is this really  necessary?   Where did he learn to speak this way?   He is also extremely  insulting to women and women issues.  You might find Bon Jovi a little more  pleasing then the foul mouthed Axel.
B00000K19E|5.0|Loved it!   Great action, plot, and even Reeves is pretty good.  If you like action movies, don't miss this!
B00004T9UF|5.0|The Marshall Mathers LP, may go down as the best CD of the year 00.The production is much tighter, this time around, and his lyrics are as strong , and controversial as ever.The stand out cut, Stan, may be one of the best  stories ever told on record, and the cut Who Knew, asks the question,  &quot;Why blame me&quot;, to all the parents of dysfunctional children.Em  wants the parents to take the time to know their kids,&quot;How much damage  can I do with a pen&quot;, Em wonders. This will be a CD people talk about  for ages, wether they are Hp Hop fans or not. A must buy!
0792842731|5.0|Its better than Goldeneye.  The action scenes are tighter, beautiful women are there.  I really enojoyed it.
0679731725|5.0|I'm hard pressed to think of a book I enjoyed more in the last 20 years.  Every time I re-read it, I keep wishing that Stevens will follow his emotions rather than trying to follow his station as butler.  Anthony  Hopkins does a terrific job in the movie showing the character's extreme  restraint and inability to acknowledge his love.  Not only is this a great  love story, it's a great historical novel, psychology study and beautifully  written to boot.  Ishiguro writes with such nuance and understatement and  with such an eye for detail that I think any reader will be captivated.  This is one of the most breathtaking books Ishiguro ever wrote and one of  the best contemporary books around.
630575067X|5.0|A great movie..........but the worst of the series.  I found Jake Loyd was a bit weak, and the atmosphere was off.  All in all, though, it was incredible.  Good action stuff and a must for Star Wars fans.  No, Jar Jar  is not that annoying!
B000002J20|4.0|Good album?  Depends on what you as a listener use music for.  This album is not good for listening to in your car while you're driving around in the city, or for playing at a party, or at the office, or for dancing to ---all  valid uses for music, but not for this album.    This album requires that  you sit down ALONE with headphones and allow the music to wash over you.   One needs to set aside time for this record.  If this is not the kind of  thing you do with music, there is no point in attempting this album.   There's also no point in comparing it to hip-hop or classical music, since  they are all different beasts with different uses &amp; implied audiences.     One thing everyone can agree on, however, is that Topographic is a  milestone in popular music history.  It nearly brought rock'n'roll into the  realm of 'high art', while at the same time it was helping to make punk  possible.  It's truly a remarkable moment in music, and the fact that kids  bought Topographic (it was the first album ever to go Gold just on advance  orders) is a remarkable statement about 70's audiences.    Along with all  the fluff, there are some truly breathtaking passages on this album that I  will remember for the rest of my life.  <br />One just needs to be willing to  wait for the magic.
6305718903|4.0|When I got this movie, I was expecting not much.  But what I got was a suspensful, thoughtful and intriguing movie.  The acting is spectacular.  I recommend it highly.
0140042520|5.0|I cannot write enough words to describe how wonderful this book is. I could write a book about its greatness, its mind-numbing beauty, its special place in the pantheon of great human achievements. Jack Kerouac was  a shooting star, a dharma bum in the truest sense of the word. This man has  a style and fluidity to his writing that is otherworldly, and yet so  magically human. He synthesizes poetry and prose in a way that not many  have ever approached. His writing is lyrics to his life, my life, your  life. He can express the human condition better than anyone I have ever  encountered. In the Dharma Bums, he tells about his adventures with Japhy  Ryder (Gary Snyder), a man who lived his life the way that Kerouac wrote.  Spontaneous, beautiful and pure. This is a book with power, that has  changed many peoples lives, including mine, and has the power to influence  so many more. Buy five copies of this book and loan them out to your  friends and strangers. Kerouac's dream of a rucksack revolution is one of  the most beautiful ideas that I have ever known, and this book is the  starting point for that inevitable revolution. So get this book and get  started. Hit the road and things will never be the same. peace.
0808540823|5.0|I think this book was flawless. It had very little appeal to me when I started reading it but as I read the story became as realistic as apart of my life. When I finished the book I had strong respect for the author. I  think Roal Dahl should be congratulated for writing such a masterwork.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Before you read this REVIEW do yourself a favor and go buy this cd!   To tell the truth i hated on eminem when he first came out.  I thought he was wack, i thought he was another vanilla ice, but i like him now.  He's kinda  like marilyn manson in that it takes a while to like his music.  His first  cd was the bomb, and i didnt think he could top that one, but this one  might very well do that.  Every song is tight on this album, except the one  with sticky fingas. Eminem is very talented! Go get this album!
B0000041DF|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, this is the definitive recording of Rachmaninov's  third concerto. Forget Horowitz 1951, this is BETTER. And it's hardly  &quot;out of control&quot;, just so fast and furious, it seems that way  sometimes. I'd probably use Ashkenazy or Bronfman to &quot;introduce&quot;  somebody to this work, but when they were ready for the hardcore stuff, I'd  give them a taste of Argerich. The third movement in particular is  unbelievably well played, with blinding speed and perfect precision. And  it's all live. There's simply no better recording out there.
0790729628|5.0|Ridley Scott's &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is one of the most influential motion pictures of all time. Its highly stylized version of a 2019 Los Angeles, which is fantastically conceived and realized, became the source  of inspiration for countless other, mostly lesser, sci-fi movies.<br />What  makes &quot;Blade Runner&quot; so remarkable is that its spectacular  production design is not the only outstanding achievement. The film has an  exciting, multi-layered story and a terrific cast. Also worth noting is the  highly supportive music by the Greek composer Vangelis.<br />&quot;Blade  Runner&quot; is one of those rare films that actually improve with each  viewing, because there is always something new to discover. The film shows  no sign of aging, which is also extremely unusual for a film with many  special-effects. If Ridley Scott had never made another movie, his place in  film history would nonetheless have been secured.
B00004T9UF|5.0|how can u review an album which is without doubt the best album ever made. u would think how could eminem possibly surpass the dopeness of dre's 2001 and his own slim shady Lp but the dude has actually done it. Not one track  on this album is anything short of ... dope. eminems rhymin still on  point and appears to have matured, there are some phat guest apperences  which his first album kinda missed dre, snoop,xzibit, rbx and D12 really  represent and the beats are straight ill. Can't really see where Eminem  gonna go from here how can he top this, ...
B00004T9UF|5.0|this new cd is awesome, every track is hilarious, especially the songs stan, ken kaniff, and criminal. Eminem made an awesome album and got back with ICP in the process
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is great.  It really shows off his talent, as does the 1st album, the Slim Shady LP.  Marshall Mathers LP is a lot angrier than his 1st LP, which really adds to the album.  There isn't as much talk about  drugs as the 1st album.  The best song on the album without a doubt is  Stan, about a crazed fan who only wants to be with him.
B00000JZC4|5.0|Filter did a great job on their latest effort. I enjoy the songs &quot;Take A Picture&quot; and &quot;The Best Things&quot;. I like the uniquness of the rest of the album. This is a good choice for an album, go  buy it.

B000000W6R|5.0|Like many people, I feel this album gets a bum rap. Likewise, the song Blew Away. It may not be a Corgan tune, but it's one of, if not THE best song on this cd. It kind of lulls you along and then tosses you across the  room. Way to go Iha!
6305728437|5.0|Mulan is the first Disney movie with that old Disney heart and magic in a long time. Not since Beauty and the Beast, or to some extent The Lion King, has a movie like this come along. It has everything for a good family  movie--a strong story, fantastic characters, heart, and a strong hero or  heroine.  The songs aren't anything to praise, but a few are rather nice.   The humor is also great, even though it's not of Aladdin calibur.  The  modern Disney formula is still there, like Mushu's western voice and  behavior, but Mulan still provides great fun for all.  It just might get  the kids interested in martial arts.  I've taken a lot of flak for trashing  Tarzan, but this movie is infinitely better.  I consider this to be the  last of Disney's greats.  I only hope I'm wrong.

Where some people say they believe  &quot;Binaural's&quot; tracks should have been arranged differently to  create more of a flow, I would say that would ruin the album.

The alarming rolls through the  versus and U2-ish finish to the chorus makes this song one of Pearl Jam's  best songs of all time. &quot;Gods' Dice&quot; and other Ament creations on  this album have thrusted him into the limelight as a premier song writer.  Though &quot;Gods' Dice&quot; is a catchy as hell tune with a rockin'  foundation (and would be a great single), Ament's other contributions are  more sultry and seductive. &quot;Nothing as it seems&quot; possesses guitar  work from the master McGready that we have never heard. &quot;Nothing as it  seems&quot; shows Aments flare for the groovy and savvy. Aments other  creation on &quot;Binaural&quot; - &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; - is equally  as sultry as &quot;Nothing&quot; - but has a chorus that will surly knock  your socks off. &quot;Sleight&quot; upon first listen of  &quot;Binaural&quot; was my favorite song. &quot;Light Years,&quot;  &quot;Parting Ways,&quot; and &quot;Thin Air&quot; offer a softer gentler  side of Pearl Jam. Much like Pearl Jam's past ballads, these are all done  very well. Sticking out from this group of sob lovers delights is  &quot;Light Years.&quot; This song displays the best from Pearl Jam. Ed's  voice is so tranquil and rhythmic, and the flow of the song is most head  bobbing worthy. &quot;Of the Girl&quot; has distinctly poignant and flowing  versus with a breakdown mid way that brings this song into the realm of the  surreal. &quot;Rival&quot; is a pure bluesy masterpiece that has Stone  Gossard written all over it. This song is reminiscent of some older Pearl  Jam songs from the beginning, but takes on a life of it's own within 20  seconds of listening (after the dog). This takes us to &quot;Soon  Forget.&quot; Ed on a ukulele. Need I say more?<br />   If I could  have written a shorter review of this album, I would have. However the  diversity and brilliance is too much for me to sum up quickly. All-in-all,  bottom line, Armageddon time - &quot;Binaural&quot; is Pearl Jam's best  album.

I am not a huge fan of flicks that feature mostly dancing and song . . but this includes so many great laughs  along with it . . The movie tells the tale of the making of the first  talking movies . .

If you are a rabid Kevin Smith fan like me, you'll love this. I know I did. All your favorites  make appearances (with new names, of course). You'll see Dante, Randall,  Walt Flanagan, Brodie, and yes, the A$$hole from Fashionable Male. Of  course there are the celebs you'll see too, like George Carlin as a  Catholic cardinal (!), Alanis Morrisette as God, Salma Hayek as a muse,  Chris Rock, that british guy with the face (sorry, guy!), Umm... and of  course, Jay and Silent Bob! I loved it. I am going to buy it as soon as I  can. Cracked me right up! watch it, buy it, laugh, and be merry! Snootchie  Bootchies! :}
B00003CXDU|5.0|I saw GALAXY QUEST in company with about 20 other writers and editors of STAR TREK novels, scripts, and CDs:  we didn't quite scare the projectionist with our shrieks of laughter at the star's Kirk imitation as  he sat in the center seat, the reference to the Klaatu Nebula, the Romulan  ale on the dinner table, the Gorn, and Alan Rickman's sardonic comment that  he sees that Allen as the Jim Kirk wannabe, managed to get his shirt off,  and many others.  <br />The action is as nonstop as the humor, and the special  effects, while stunning, do not get in the way of story, action, and the  spirit of what is really a very sweet-natured film.<br />From the first  pullback shot of the Questarians on convention (I've spoken at SF  conventions and STAR TREK conventions, so I can attest to the  &quot;reality&quot; of the scene) to the way that the fans band together  and, essentially, save the day, to the look of utter joy on the kids' faces  as they guide the wandering starship home, this is a film that makes gentle  fun of the people who will understand it best, but that laughs along with  them, and leaves them, not just laughing, but the ultimate winners.<br />Even  the biggest cynics, like Rickman's irascible actor with his five curtain  calls playing RICHARD III, get beyond their disillusionment thanks to the  faith, trust, and technical skill of the Thermians, while Tim Allen's  confession that he &quot;lied&quot; marks the beginning of a rebirth of his  spirit -- and Mathesar's evolution into his own command abilities.  And  Sigourney Weaver and her Wonderbra chronicle how a &quot;dumb blonde&quot;  develops courage, love, and self-respect.<br />A wonderful film.  You don't  need to know STAR TREK to love it -- but it's more fun if you do.  Pass the  popcorn.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Well, he's done it again. This CD is actually better than his first! Who knew Em would top his own spectacular work? Anyway, this album is great. PSA 2000 is so funny. Kill You is great, with semi-serious lyrics. Paul is  good, too. Ken Kaniff is the funniest thing on here. One of the best songs  on here would be Criminal, with it's funny and serious lyrics. If you don't  own this, and you have the first CD, go buy this one. You'll love it. Only  thing is, in this one, Eminem yells a lot, and he's angry on a lot of the  songs. Very angry. Not like on the last CD. Oh well, I think it just adds  to the greatness of this masterpiece. Pick one up today.
B0000203YT|5.0|Only Tom Stoppard is capable of creating this degree of intoxication with dialogue that, although not Shakespeare's, rings with the music of his mighty iambic pentameter line.  <br />And the players speak the speech as he  and his colleague pronounce it to them, trippingly off the tongue.  This  film seems to bubble, as if it were filmed through a lens of champagne.   Although it has its moments of sorrow, embarrassment, ribaldry, and  cynicism -- all of which are quite in character -- most of it is pure,  golden joy, presided over by an ironic Judi Dench at the height of her --  and Her Majesty's -- power.<br />Paltrow and Fiennes are extraordinary as the  two lovers, as much in love with words and the theatre as with their  exceedingly attractive selves.  John Madden is hilarious.<br />And the idiot  faith that &quot;it's a mystery&quot; but that the show not only must go on  but somehow does, transmits itself to everyone that it touches.<br />This is  an adult comedy in all senses:  it demands careful listening and joyous  laughter -- and gives you more than you give it.
B000002UUX|5.0|Holy Wars... the meaning of Megadeth is all over this album. It's the top of the peak, because sinde &quot;Countdown&quot; They are going down. This album is thrash, in a musical meaning, and if  it is your first Megadeth  album... you could be dissapointed when you listen to the others (Maybe  Youthanasia and Hidden would be right, but not this good) <br />Just wait for  this for the final, and I swear you'll see your wait will get gain.<br />This  album is tremendously adictive. DOn't let fool hands touch it (or fool ears  to listen)<br />If you listen &quot;Tornado of souls&quot; ANd you don't feel  ecsastic... then buy a chess game.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The latest release from the infamous Slim Shady, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; is sure to cause quite a stir in the press.  The sophmore album from Eminem proves that he can be just as nasty and dirty as the next  rapper.<br />In this LP, he is, as stated in track #6, &quot;rapping about  homosexuals and vicadin.&quot;  Some of his targets are the pop group  'NSYNC and teen diva Christina Aguilera.<br />Here is a breakdown of each  track:<br />1.) Public Service Announcement 2000 - The sequel to the PSA on  the Slim Shady LP.<br />2.) Kill You - Em raps about killing the two most  important women in his life, his mom and his wife, Kim.<br />3.) Stan (ft.  Dido) - This is the best track on the entire album.  This is about a fan  named Stan.<br />4.) Paul (skit) - Another skit from a cop named Paul.<br />5.)  Who Knew - This one is about how he didn't know that kids would do what he  says.<br />6.) Steve Berman (skit) - A skit about a meeting with record  executive Steve Berman.<br />7.) The Way I Am - Explains why he acts how he  acts.<br />8.) The Real Slim Shady - The first single off the album.  Says he  is the true Slim Shady and everyone who claims to be are just  imitating.<br />9.) Remember Me? (ft. RBX &amp; Sticky Fingaz) - The first  track to include guest rappers.  About how he is still rapping and won't  leave.<br />10.) I'm Back - One of my favorites, a song that proves he's back  for more dissing.<br />11.) Marshall Mathers - The track that is flourishing  with dirty comments about 'NSYNC, Britney Spears, ICP and others.<br />12.)  Ken Kaniff (skit) - The nastiest, most obscence track on the LP.  A  encounter with the oral pleasures between Ken Kaniff and the Insane Clown  Posse.<br />13.) Drug Ballad - About how the press is all up in his  face.<br />14.) Amityville (ft. Bizarre) - The ode to his hometown,  Detroit.<br />15.) Bitch Please II (ft. Dre, Snoop, Xzibit &amp; Nate Dogg) -  The sequel to the original track on Snoop Dogg's &quot;Top Dogg.&quot;   Features blazing appearances by Dre &amp; Snoop.<br />16.) Kim - The most  disturbing track on the album.  This one is about killing his girlfriend  (now wife) Kim Scott.  This was originally titled &quot;Bitch So  Wrong.&quot;<br />17.) Under the Influence - The catchiest hook provides that  if you don't his music, you can ...<br />18.) Criminal - The final  track is about when he says he wants to kill someone, everyone thinks he  will.<br />Well, this has been a brief breakdown of the latest release from  Eminem, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP.&quot;  If you love rap, you should  definitely cop this. ...
B00000BKDY|5.0|... would you care to take a look?<br />THat's the way this begins. And when you finish, you'll find yourself loving this album. THey used a little more synthetizers, and they did it well. So, this album is one of my personal  favorites (I like it more than Number of the beast... Can you imagine?).  Quality is not a proble. Use your random player on your CD player and  you'll get 8 great songs. You want to get shocked? Try Track title or Sea  of madness. Want to cry? Wasted years Want to feel... ecsastic? Stranger in  a strange land Want to have rhytm? Heaven can wait Want a good finish? Deja  VU and Alexander the great. Don't waste your time always searching for  other discs (not from maiden). Face up, make your stand... and realiza  you're watching a better one. Hey, the album can announce itself.<br />Ha,  enjoy it! 5 stars!
B00000055E|5.0|This album is only for REAL TUPAC fans that pay attention to lyrics as well as the beats, while some of the beats were off, PAC's voice shined  alongside with his lyrical skills.  This album has songs taken from when  he was a teen, which is why some people might not feel him. But that's cool  because tupac was all about keeping it real and if you don't feel this  album then you aren't real. No, I am not implying that you have to like it,  but you can't call it WACK even if you didn't appreciate his work.  FOr  people to sit there and say PAC was pretty weak on this album is like  saying Michael Jordan was WACK back in his college days of hoops. My point  being is you can't compare PAC then and now of course he's different  now-he's matured even moreso.<br /> In all I do believe that REAL pac fans  will LOVE this album because it displays Pac's lyrical versitility from way  back in the days.<br />peace<br />mic 12
B000002V0Q|4.0|The album looked very promising, but it doesn't have the feel they got on the previous album &quot;Rust in peace&quot;. They fall a little on power, but they gained in this new kind of music. You'll like songs like  &quot;Sweating bullets&quot; &quot;Foreclosure of a dream&quot; and  &quot;Symphony of destruction&quot; <br />IT's a very good album, and I have  to say than it was my first album from Megadeth, I loved it, but as soon as  you listen RUST or Youthanasia, this will be second place (or even third)
B00004T9UF|4.0|Eminem has mastered his rapping skills and this album is even better than his debut album which came out last year.  Many guest appearances including Dre, Snoop, and D-12.  The lyrics are still great and hilarious but the  beats are even better.  Some songs of interest are &quot;Marshall  Mathers&quot;, &quot;Under the Influence&quot;, &quot;The Real Slim  Shady&quot;, and the greatest song on the album, &quot;Stan&quot;.  It is  about a stalker-fan dude and it is funny as hell.  Buy this today but be  prepared to hear some lyrics that are funny, and defintily obscene.
B000001Y5D|1.0|&quot;What's Up&quot; has got to be one of the worst singles of all time.  The music is uninspired and the &quot;singing&quot; is gawdawful.  I was forced to listen to this album years ago by some misguided friends and I  honestly did want to know what IS going on.  There are fine examples of  folk/rock/soul/etc but this ain't one of them.
079074404X|5.0|This is the seminal sci-fi movie, with one memorable scene after another.
B0000019PA|5.0|I was introduced to this band by way of their other album, ON AVERY ISLAND, by a friend of mine who assured me that as good as AVERY was, &quot;IN THE AEROPLANE...&quot; was better.  I began hearing more and more  about the band and glowing reviews for this album and frontman, Jeff  Mangum.  I bought it and it hasn't left my CD player since.  This album  defies genre typing and is one of the most powerful I own.  Jeff Mangum's  heartbreakingly beautiful, honest voice and BRILLIANT lyrics - coupled with  every instrument from a saw to a flugelhorn, zinthaphone to Scottish  Highland pipes and good old guitar is dizzying in its scope, range and  sheer ability to absorb you into the song.  No music fan will be left upset   - with gears changing from the somewhat ballad-esque &quot;King of Carrot  Flowers Parts 1,2 &amp;3&quot; to out and out blast away rockers like the  9th track &quot;Ghost&quot; and the untitled 10th track - which may be the  most thunderous, amazing heart-pounding piece of music I've ever heard - no  bull...your heart may explode upon hearing it.  I still can't listen to the  last track &quot;2 Headed boy part 2&quot; without weeping.  I am writing  this review in the hope that one adventurous soul will give this album just  one listen.  I assure you that that will be enough to hook you for good.   One of the best purchases I've made musically.  Period.
6305622825|5.0|Great fun. I loved every minute of this movie.Marvelous acting by Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones[my favorite actress]and Will Patton. Ving Rhames and Maury Chaykin-awfull. Entrapment-2nd only to my favorite #1  movie The Mask Of Zorro- has it all.Nail-biting seat-gluing suspense and  excellent kissing scenes. An Oscar-worthy Blockbuster. Rated PG in my mind.  Perfect for the entire family.
B00004T9UF|4.0|i don't care what anybody says this boy can flow, some of the concepts for the songs are very corny, hotest tracks stan, marshall mathers, remember me, and b please 2
0792157869|5.0|Steven Speilberg[Indiana Jones/ Lost Ark,The Mask Of Zorro]does it again in this thrill a minute actioneer. Harrison Ford[Star Wars Episodes IV-VI]does an excellent job. Sean Connery[  James Bond]does a terrific job  as Indy's dad especially in the `Junior' scenes.He was breathlessly funny.  Mr. Lucas,Mr. Speilberg and Mr. Ford have done it again. Sure to remain a  family favorite.
B00003CXC7|5.0|One of the best movies ever made! A murder-mystery that is perfectly executed. A movie that leaves You feeling good and makes You question the talent of todays moviemakers.<br />Do yourself a favour and see it!<br />The only  thing that would add to this masterpiece is a DVD-edition viewed on a rainy  sunday-afternoon!
6302206294|5.0|Kevin Costner IS Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves in the best adventure movie of 1991. I loved this movie. Sean Connery's cameo appearance as King Richard came as a terrific suprise to my mom and I. Rated PG in my mind.  Perfect for the entire family.Sean Connery and Kevin Costner  do it again.
0060194995|5.0|I learned so much about human nature from this book.  Throughout the entire novel I laughed, cried, and fell in love with the three main characters, Gem, Scout, and Atticus.  I would highly reccormend this book  for anyone who loves to read about real life situations.  This novel is one  that I will surely have in my life always.
B000000W9Z|5.0|When I first heard 1. Outside, I checked it out from the library in order  to educate myself about David Bowie, a highly respected artist who I knew  very little about.  Hearing it, I was stunned.  I thought David Bowie was  about 70's pop like Golden Years and Fame, not dark, demented concept  albums and ambient electronic soundscapes.  &quot;Wow, so this is 1995  David Bowie,&quot; I thought.  It is amazing and some of THE BEST MUSIC I  HAVE EVER HEARD.  I've since explored both classic Bowie and his more  recent work and nothing compares.  1997's Earthling is good, but not as  good in my opinion and while I've grown to like his classics like Ziggy  Stardust or Low, it's a completely different ball park.  Some long time  Bowie fans may very well appreciate Outside, but don't assume you'll like  Outside because you rock and roll to Diamond Dogs.  I could even envision  some Bowie fans grimacing when they hear their favorite classic pop star  making some danm techno.  In my opinion this is more likely to be  appreciated fans of contempory music like Nine Inch Nails, or maybe even  Radiohead, than by Ziggy fans.  But still, I must highly recomend this  record.  It's a masterpiece.<br />My favorite tracks include: Outside, Heart's  Filthy Lesson, I Have Not Been To Oxford Town, No Control, I Am With Name,  Thru' These Architects Eyes, really everything.  As individual songs go,  they're all fantastic, and along with the spoken word seques, they make 1.  Outside a truly mezmorizing concept album.<br />I pray David Bowie and Brian  Eno get back to work on 2. Contamination, the supposed next installment of  a trilogy.
0060987464|4.0|This book went into great detail about his life. It had every littel detail about him but, it had strong languge.  I never skiped any pages and It never Had a boring part.
630512762X|3.0|In my opinion Face Off was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. John Travolta is a terrific star, so is Nicolas Cage. The special effects were great. 5 stars to the Movie.
B00000JCB2|1.0|Actually one star is pretty harsh. I guess there are a few people out there who think bad boy posing, 'explicit' lyrics and childish songs are good. The same people that will buy the album cos 'That nookie song on MTV  was good!'. Pah. Well pose with all your rock and rap friends all you like  Fred because the only fans you're taking with you are the ones who aren't  going to give a damn when the next trend comes along and leaves you washed  up. I can't believe this is by the same band who released '3 Dollar Bill  Y'all'...
B00004T9UH|5.0|After The Slim Shady LP I found myself in amazement.  I white rapper.  Yeah right we have another Vanilla Ice here.  Then Everyone started talking about Eminem and &quot;My name is.&quot;  At first every African American  was talking about how &quot;cat&quot; Eminem is and stuff like that.  Every  White person loved him.<br />Finally came Dre 2001.  Eminem's cut &quot;Forgot  about Dre&quot; was the biggest hit from CD and from there on out everyone  has been looking forward to this album.  <br />At first people were worried  about the &quot;Sophomore Slump.&quot;  You know all the good rappers have  them Snoop, Dre, Jay - Z, Puffy, etc.  But what people did not realize was  that not every good rapper actually have them.  DMX didn't and now Eminem  did not as well.<br />On this album you have all the elements of a  &quot;great&quot; album.  Starting with &quot;Kill You.&quot;  A track  where Emienem is talking about exactly that.  After that comes possibly one  of the best tracks &quot;Stan.&quot;  Of course &quot;The Real Slim  Shady&quot;  where he talks about everyone from Will Smith to Christina  Aguilera.  The best track on the CD to me is &quot;Marshall Mathers.&quot;   This shows the true Marshall Mathers in this track.  He talks about  everyone from New Kids on the Block to Britney Spears to N Sync and the  backstreet Boys.
0684874350|5.0|I have to say that the only way one wouldn't love this book is if they grew up with Mike and Carol Brady and then had their soul stolen from them.  I think the brilliance of this book is the narrative in which it is  written.  You hear his voice in every sentence, you hear him as he spoke in  whatever stage of his life he was in.  People were like he described,  people lived like he described, children suffered like he did.  The fact  that this man came out alive and smiling is purely a miracle.  Buy it at  once and then buy 'Tis.  Afterwards, write Frank and beg him for more!
0385484518|2.0|AS A FUTURE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL I THINK THAT THE BOOK &quot;TUESDAY WITH MORRIE&quot; WAS AN EXCELLENT BOOK. IT HAD A LOT OF SAD PARTS THAT MAKE A PERSON MORE INTERESTED IN THE BOOK. I FEEL THAT A PERSON THAT TAKES TIME  OUT HIS DAY TO SPEND WITH A FRIEND IS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY. THAT'S WHY I  GAVE THIS BOOK TWO STARS. AS A STUDENT OF MORRIE'S MITCH GREW CLOSER AND  CLOSER TO MORRIE ONCE HE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ALS, THAT  SOON HE WOULD DIE. EVERY CHANCE MITCH HAD TO SPEND TIME HE DID AND THAT  SHOWS THAT HE CARED A LOT FOR MORRIE. THIS BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD AND  DEDICATE IT TO ANYONE GOING INTO THE MEDICAL FIELD.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is so sweeeeeeeeeet.  I have never heard a better CD than this.  You will never get sick of it.  Eminem totally tops his first CD.  I dont think he will be able to top this CD.  Trust me, Buy it.  EMINEM  RULEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
B000023X9W|4.0|Sometime ago I read a review written by  (I think) Kurt Loder for Rolling Stone.  In the review for what I believe was &quot;Ragged Glory&quot;, he proclaimed Neil Young the King of Rock-n-Roll.  I didn't disagree then, I  don't disagree now.<br />Silver and Gold is what I like to call &quot;nice  Neil&quot;.  &quot;Evil Neil&quot; is my favorite side.  When Neil is  wearing his full Mr. Hyde outfit, look out.  But what's great about Neil is  he can make a &quot;mellow&quot; CD, and who's to complain.  <br />Silver and  Gold is not my favorite Neil recording, nor will it be. I still reserve  &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; for that honor, but there are certainly some  great songs here.  Maybe &quot;Harvest Moon II&quot; is the best way to  describe this.  I've read where Neil compares it to &quot;After the Gold  Rush&quot;, which is fair, but Silver&amp;Gold is too minimalist  instrumentally to be a parallel.  <br />&quot;Razor Love&quot; is the  tremendous standout here.  Beautiful lyric so typical of Neil and so very  nearly un-approachable save for a few other song writers.  The one-two  punch of &quot;Razor Love&quot; and &quot;Without Rings&quot; to end the CD  makes me push the start button again.<br />&quot;Daddy went Walkin'&quot; is  the only song I really don't like here, so I gave it 4 stars because it  ruins (in my opinion) a perfect &quot;nice Neil&quot; session.  Much the  same way &quot;Old king&quot; did on Harvest Moon.  But even a King can't  be perfect everytime.
B00001QEE7|5.0|Disney took the classic fairy tale and gave it a happy ending.  Luckily, this does not spoil the tale in my opinion - and we were all expecting it, anyway, weren't we?<br />While the story is good, the music score is great.   Alan Menken did a perfect job of scoring this.  The melodic lines are pure  and beautiful, with a slightly jazzy feel to the entire movie.  Among the  best pieces are &quot;Under the Sea&quot; and &quot;Part of Your  World&quot;.<br />Since Disney still has its policy of withdrawing their  releases to whet the public's appetite, you need to buy this - there's no  telling when it may be available again.

B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is one of those movies that is either loved or despised.  The story is a pretty ordinary tale of a person who is unaware that he is destined to save humanity.  (Keanu Reeves is excellent as a man who is  never quite sure what is going on.)<br />The setting is imaginative and well  portrayed, although not groundbreaking.  The special effects, however, most  certainly are.  The DVD contains a behind-the-scenes look at how those  freeze 'em then spin 'em in the air scenes were created.<br />I'm still not  completely sure why, but the combination of special effects and original  setting goes to make this movie compulsive viewing.

B00000J2KX|5.0|Was the book better than the movie?  WHO CARES!  This movie's got JACK!  Seriously, one of the most psychotic performances in screen history.  Nicholson WILL scare you, and if he doesn't Kubrick will, with his  collection of whacked out special effects and sound effects.  Shelley  Duvall was perfectly cast as the dullard wife in this movie and the kid,  &quot;Danny&quot; gives a chilling performance.  This may not be the same  as adaptation as King's, but one thing is for sure, the Shining will scare  the pants off of you.
B000003BDJ|5.0|If you're thinking about buying this CD, chances are you are a relatively new fan of the Stones, and are looking for a good CD to get you started.  Look no further.  This is an excellent compilation of the biggest hits the  Stones had when they were the hottest rock band in the world.<br />Highlights  on Disc One include &quot;Satisfaction&quot; (which is quite possibly the  best rock song ever recorded), the dark &quot;Paint It Black,&quot; and the  gorgeous ballad &quot;Ruby Tuesday.&quot;  On Disc Two the best include the  rocking &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash,&quot; the redneck-flavored &quot;Honky  Tonk Woman,&quot; and the ambitious statement &quot;You Can't Always Get  What You Want.&quot;  But every single song is worth a listen, I generally  don't skip any tracks.<br />If you are already a Stones fan, chances are you  already have most of these songs on their respective albums.  But if you  are just starting to come around, I definitely recommend Hot Rocks as a  smart buy.

0767819594|5.0|Ever put in a movie, sit through it, finish it, and just see the credits as you say &quot;Damn...&quot;? Rent Cruel Intentions starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Reese Witherspoon if you've never  experienced that. Sebastian (Phillippe) will stop at nothing to win a bet  with his step-sister Kathryn (Gellar). He must woo the young Annette  (Witherspoon) in order to win. If Kathryn wins, she gets his car. If  Sebastian wins, he gets her...in bed. One rule according to Sebastian's  mind: Don't fall in love. With nonstop twists and jawdropping surprizes,  Cruel Intentions is a film that is sure to please people of all ages. Rated  R for nudity, course language, and gobs of sexual matter.
0783229526|5.0|I dont understand how most of the critics hated this movie.  In fact the late Gene Siskel is the only one i know who like it.  Maybe its because the story dosnt have any real moral or message in it, just like the book it  only reports what happens to these two fools.  In fact this is one of the  realist movies I've ever seen in the way that the plot unfolds and how the  characters react to each situation with a twisted mind.  The only thing i  can find wrong with the movie is that the sound is rather dull, I have to  turn the volume on my TV about all the way up before i can really hear  anything.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD is totally better than the first one.It is a very violent album.If  I were you I would go out and buy it because it's worth your money.
B000002LQD|5.0|Magic and Loss is second in Lou's brilliant trilogy of concept albums. The first is New York, Magic and Loss is the second and his latest album, Ecstacy. All three of these albums are incredible. New York is obviously  about New York. Ecstacy is about a failed marriage, and Magic and Loss is  about the magic of love and the horror of losing it. It isn't right to pick  out the &quot;best&quot; songs on the album, because the album really  should be listened to all the way through. This album is deffinately worth  listening to. One of Reed's all time best.
0767802551|5.0|The title of this review is a phrase said by one Benjamin &quot;Lefty&quot; Ruggerro. In the same way some war veterans talk of nothing but their heroics, struggles and the mechanics of their war, Lefty  is obsessed with the mythology of the mafia. Toobad for him he is less a  Godfather and more of a small fish on the mafia foodchain. The rest of that  phrase is &quot;...and its your best friend that does it.&quot;        Donnie Brasco tells the story of undercover agent Joe Pistone's (Johnny  Deppy) ifilteration of the mob in 1978. He introduces himself as &quot;Don  the jeweller&quot;. He immediately gains the respect and love of Lefty (Al  Pacino), and he is presented to the rest of the crew as a &quot;a friend of  Lefty's&quot;. You see, if he is a &quot;friend of Lefty's&quot; that means  he is a connected guy, if he were a &quot;friend of ours&quot; that would  make him a made guy.  <br />   Donnie Brasco will not disappoint fans of the  genre, it has all the mob talk, the back alley butcherings and the tense  stand offs. But what makes the film the masterpiece that it is, the warm  and brilliantly acted and realised central relationship between Donnie/Joe  and Lefty. I read an interview with director Mike Newel where he called the  film &quot;a love story&quot;, and that is absolutely right. <br />   People  often accuse Al Pacino of hamming it up and going for an autopilot  &quot;whoa&quot; performance in many of his films, like his Satan in The  Devil's Advocate. Nevermind the fact that Pacino's autopilot is more  gripping then most actors' most vivid characterisation, his performance in  Donnie Brasco is arguably his best. As Lefty Ruggerro he is both  heartbreaking and frightening, ruthless and all too human. He delivers his  lines with is patented fiery intensity, but this time he lets you know he's  bluffing, that he' can't back up that big mouth of his. He shines in two  particular scenes, one in the hospital and the other is final haunting  scene. I will not describe them here. See them for yourself. <br />  Donnie  Brasco was released in the spring of 1997, and since the Academy has a  pathetically short memory, the film only managed one Oscar nomination which  was for Paul Attanasio screen adaptation. When they ignored Pacino's  performance here, that is when they completely lost credibility with me.<br />   Is Donnie Brasco one of the best gangster pictures ever made?  Fuggedaboutit (in the positive sense of the phrase). It deserves to sit at  the same table and have coffee on the house with the masterpiece of the  genre, Goodfellas.

6305736650|3.0|If you're one of those people who loves Casablanca unconditionally then what are you doing reading reviews? Go watch it again and continue your beautiful friendship with the film. There is an air of nostalgia that  surrounds people who grew up with the film that obscures the fact that it  is indeed a very silly piece of melodrama peppered with some priceless  moments.<br />  One thing in Casablanca that hasn't aged, and I guess will  never age is Humphrey Bogart's brilliant performance as Rick. He is the  owner of Rick's Cafe Amercain, where just about everybody comes. He hides  his idealism under a thick and delicious coat of cynicism, when he says  &quot;I don't stick my neck out for nobody&quot;, you know at that point  that he would and will. But his tough armour is broken, as it is always in  the movies, by a long lost love who walks into his bar early on in the  film, her name is Ilsa played by the lovely Ingrid Bergman. They were  lovers once in Paris, but that was before she learnt that her husband was  alive. Now accompaning her husband Laszlo(Paul Henreid) who is in  Casablanca as an underground leader of the French resistance to the Nazis.  Complicated events unfold after that setup, but I wouldn't want to spoil it  for the few who haven't seen it.<br />   Casablanca has a labyrinthine plot  involving the battle between the Nazis and the French resistance in North  Africa, but you never take any of this seriously, never for a moment  believe its melodramatic twists and certainly never believe that those  backlots look anything like Morocco. The political realism of the film is  ludicrous, specifically the ending which I can't reveal as that would be a  spoiler. If the film works, it is because of those treasured individual  moments, Sam(Dooley Wilson) playing &quot;As time goes by&quot;, the aching  looks of love between Rick and Ilsa, the colorful local and the one and  only Humphrey Bogart.<br />  You constantly hear professional critics such as  Leonard Maltin above refering to Casablanca as one of the greatest films  ever made, and they may genuinely believe that. The truth is that after  Anthony Minghella's THE ENGLISH PATIENT and Peter Weir's GALLIPOLI,  Casablanca looks very thin indeed. The fact of the matter is no  professional critic would ever be able to get away with criticising  Casablanca. I think it would be safer to read amatuer critics when you're  checking on the &quot;classics&quot;, they have a lot less to lose.     <br />     Classics such as CITIZEN KANE, THE THIRD MAN, and THE MALTESE FALCON are  genuinely great films that have stood the test of time. Turn out the  lights, forget the reviews and these films would still be stunning.  Casablanca is not in the same league as those titles.<br />   I'd hate to give  the impression that Casablanca is a bad film, it is merely a light weight  one that lives on its gentle charm. Its also a film that will join my  Blasphemy files (overrated films that no one dares to criticise) along with  such titles as Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton and Steven Spielberg's Close  Encounter of The Third Kind. But enough sin for now.
B00004TJK2|5.0|I was in love with the choppy American cut of this film, but to see the original cut just blows me away. It's about time they released it, so we don't have to kill eachother to win auctions for the PAL tapes. WOO_HOO!   Jean Marc Barr is remarkable, as well as Reno. If you buy it and don't love  it, send it to me.
0451160916|5.0|As Siskel and Ebert would say, &quot;two thumbs up&quot;. The Shining was a fantastic and suspenseful horror novel. I could not put it down. All the clues and the hints that showed that there was a definite plot made it such  an intriguing novel to read.     Stephen King has such great writing skills  and really makes his reader use their imagination. He describes his  characters so well and you feel like you know them. He takes his time and  lets you get a good sense of what the characters are like instead of just  rushing into the climax and having 1000 pages of denoument after.     Stephen King uses such wonderful foreshadowing, but he uses it in a  different way. The main character's son , Danny, is psychic and all of the  hints and clues kind of go through him.    I recommend this book to Stephen  King lovers and also to people who like a good scare or two. It's kind of a  challenging book , it's actually about 450 pages. Probably only really  meant for highschoolers and up to read.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is great CD, its the classic Eminem stuff. It is great, although i dont like his attitude b/c of his feude with ICP, i like ICP better, but this CD is GREAT!
B000000OXH|4.0|Slightly more sophisticated than their debut, the original quartet (howe, downes, palmer, and wetton) create another album of basic pop rock songs with progressive flourishes here and there.  If you're a fan of this type  of music, you won't be disappointed.
B000002LMK|5.0|It's simple: this is one of the best albums ever made.  It swoops. It wails. It's honest, gut-wrenching, intelligent, and soulful.  Humor, love, frustration, grief, and sheer exhilaration abound.  It's Neil.  And it's  the full-on, gotta-love-it, melodic electric guitar assault, dear ones:  it's not Harvest Moon (that came next and is also wonderful).  If you like  emotional rock and roll that powers its way to great heights and depths,  you must have Ragged Glory.  Accept no substitutes.  This is the real deal.
0689825498|5.0|My daughter(23m) still loves this book and has from the very beginning. It is a delightful book for kids that are fascinated by animals.
006092988X|5.0|When I first read this book I had never been out of India and I  certainly had no idea what Brooklyn was like. Ms. Smith's book not only brought it to life for me but also told a universal story of a young girl trying to break  free of the shackles that her circumstances had imposed on her.Its easy to  identify with Francie's struggles and her happiness.This well written book  with well drawn characters left me with a good ,clean feeling.The imagery  of the tree trying to grow will probably be better understood by city  dwellers but is nonetheless very effective.
B000000QFV|4.0|many old fans dislike this album and for a good reason that it has nothing to do with their essential albums with ozzy. but for me, it was the first black sabbath album to listen to and I found it quite amazing. the opening  song anno mundi is one of my favorite hardrock songs ever and valhalla,  jerusalem or heaven in black are highlights on this album. sure if you love  old black sabbath to death there will be nothing that can keep you this cd  from breaking this cd in two, but I suggest that you listen to it with an  open mind. if you liked this one i would also recommend &quot;The eternal  Idol&quot;, it is in parts even better than tyr and has with it's title  track again one of the best bs songs ever written. anyway it's not quite  easy to get into black sabbath when you are a nineteen year old guy that  listens to nearly every kind of music ( like I am) but if you want to, I  suggest you start with this.
0060923989|1.0|The Pride of Miss Jean Brody was boring and a horrible book.
B00000JGOJ|4.0|This is a fantastic film, it has amazing &quot;star power&quot; but the real winning element is the script, allowing intelligence without being pretencious and humour without taking away the true emotion of the  characters. I was enchanted by the chemistry between the protagonists.   Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands are fantastic as the leading Patriarchs in  this romantic maze of interludes and love affairs.  I hope you enjoy the  film as much as I did.  If you are a Gillian Anderson fan you will not be  disappointed, she shows just how diverse an actress she actually is by  playing a vulnerable, frustrating but lovable Meredith.
B00003CX59|5.0|This movie ruled,it's that simple. I'm not a big Depp fan,but he was great in this. They also could'nt have picked a better Horseman than Walken,this movie was hands down the best thriller of '99(Lake Placid being a very  close second) this made the Sixth Sense look like a booger. It has it all  it's scary,funny and action packed. A definite must see.
6304711891|4.0|You can always tell a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay movie even if you only see about a minute of it. <br />What is their obsession with explosions?<br />Granted, for this movie, they were pretty much necessary to  certain parts, i.e., the thermite plasma and the incendiary bomb dropped  into the tunnel system. But their other movies (Armageddon, Con Air) go way  into the realm of the unrealistic.<br />I got to wonder if the movie would  have been better if it been made by a different team. <br />One thing that was  really annoying, something I didn't notice until recently, was the constant  sounds of weapons being cocked. <br />A guy could be holding an M16 or an MP5  and all he'll do is move it a few inches and you'll here the chuk-uk of the  action being worked. I got to admit it sounds cool, but in real life, each  time you hear that sound, a round would fall to the  ground.<br />Bruckheimer/Bay put too much of their own B.S. into movies and  that really takes away from it.<br />I think &quot;The Rock&quot; is their  best film, due mostly to the actors. <br />Basically, a good action movie but  too much B.S.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This cd is the best cd i've listend to all year.  Slim shdey is taking  over.  Some may say he's just another vanella ice, but thats wack, he's the  best white rapper of all time.  He says whats on his mind.
0790737973|4.0|&quot;Sphere&quot; is definitely one of the better science-fiction films of late. <br />I took one star off because even though Dustin Hoffman is a very good actor, his voice was so hushed and muddled in the movie, I had to  struggle sometimes to figure out what he was saying.<br />Anybody reasonably  intelligent who likes sci/fi would probably like this movie. <br />It has very  intriguing dialogue and the acting is excellent. It's a good mix of  mystery, humor, and terror.<br />I don't think it was even meant to be scary,  but the musical score along with certain sequences were very chilling.  <br />Overall, Just A Really Cool Movie.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This cd was the best cd i've listend to all year.  I heard da 504 boyz, it was tight, but if you liked that you'll luv this.  Sure he may offend some people, but he does it in a very funney way.   Go get this cd
B0000027I6|5.0|It ain't even a quesshun, dis B 1 o' da best albums in the history of rock and the spoken, or sung word.<br />Instead of Roger Waters letting the music speak for itself, as do most musicians, Roger tells the tale of modern life  in the best way possible: through his wit and witticisms. <br />I'm also a  very credible and trustworthy critic on this album, seeing how I think  socialists are for the most part scumbags, and seeing how Roger is a  socialist and seeing how he is one of the exceptions to the rule. You won't  find too many so-called &quot;rock critics&quot; siding with my viewpoint  there.<br />Jeff Beck's guitars will send shivers up your spine, as will the  keyboards, particularly on &quot;The Ballad of Bill Hubbard&quot; and  &quot;It's a Miracle,&quot; among many others, and the moods on the whole  epic CD range from sad and heartwrenching to feel-good and euphoric. The  jungle beats add to the soundtrack quality, placing you in each scene. In  fact, the first time I heard this CD was after coming back from seeing the  haunting war epic, &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; which really helped to  put Roger's commentary into perspective.<br />Marv Albert's faux-commentary  during one of the songs (a clip of which is played during the Roger Waters  tour) is a funny, gently-mocking bonus.<br />That said, this album is the  reason my brother's license plate reads &quot;RWATERS.&quot;<br />5 stars.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney Spears does it again with &quot;Oops I Did It Again&quot;, a collection of 12 pop songs that are sure to increases Britney's appeal beyond the teenagers she has bowing down now. On this CD, Britney continues  the trend of working with the best writers and producers in the business to  get the best songs possible. The fingerprints of Max Martin and his team at  Cherion Productions in Sweden are responsible for over half the album. The  albums title track is already a huge hit and for good reasons. &quot;Oops I  Did It Again&quot; rates a 10 on the creativity level, with a solid hook  and a strong melody adding to the appeal. Having great, catchy songs is the  key to success in this pop market and Max Martin brings that to this album.  Songs like &quot;What U See (Is What U Get)&quot;, Can't Make You Love Me,  and the authoritative &quot;Stronger&quot; all bring out the spunky side of  Britney's talent. &quot;Don't Go Knockin On  My Door&quot; is certainly  Britney's &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot; (N-Sync) only this time is the female  telling the male that it's all over. On &quot;Lucky&quot;, Britney speaks  about  a fictional superstar who is experiencing the downside to a life of  fame. It is a very personal track that almost makes you believe that  Britney's speaking about herself. Max Martin also delivers a powerful  ballad entitled &quot;Where Are You Now.&quot; The song is the first true  power ballad that Britney has ever tackled and it proves (around the final  chorus) that Britney's voice has improved drastically since &quot;Baby One  More Time.&quot; While Martin's song are great, the best work comes from  the other music makers on this album. Darkchild Rodney Jerkins helps  Britney remake Satisfaction, the old Rolling Stone song. While the vocal  performance isn't anything spectacular, the music is incredible. Using drum  machines and keyboards, Jerkins creates a new, fresh sound to a timeless  classic that regardless what others say is re-made quite wellhere. My  favorite track is the mid-tempo &quot;When Your Eyes Say It.&quot; Written  by the great Diane Warren, the song fits Britney's vocal range very nicely.  Instrumentations on this song are just right, as producer Steve Lunt uses a  gorgeous string arrangement to give the song a very sweet sound that could  be a huge hit at radio. Unlike other Diane Warren power ballads, this song  simply flows slowly but beautifully. Certainly one that Jive should  consider as a single as it is glorious. &quot;Dear Diary&quot; (a song  co-written by Spears) has taking a pounding by critics for being well,  corny. However, It's obviously a song Britney loves as she sings with the  most emotion then any other song on the album. While critics may be right  about the lyrics, they cannot deny that the song is very charming, with  another beautiful arrangement of instruments leading the way.  The bottom  line on this album is that it is shows a bit of maturity in the material  Britney is singing and some improvement in her vocal range. Certainly  nobody can deny that this type of material will once again led to millions  and millions of record sales for a CD that didn't disappoint this listener.
014028009X|5.0|I didn't care much for it after reading the first few pages, but my friends all raved about it, so I kept reading and was not at all disappointed. I think every woman can relate to Bridget, somehow, which  makes it even more enjoyable.  I can't wait to start her new book.
0618001905|4.0|One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry--both when reading the book itself and when reading some of the reviews posted here.<br />On the one hand it's good to see that Hochschild's excellent work of popular history has  generated some justifiable outrage. On the other hand it's sad that so many  had learned so little about these atrocities before encountering the  book--a sad commentary on America's politically correct schools. (Be  advised that by &quot;politically correct&quot; I mean &quot;slanted in  favor of conservatism, racism, etc.&quot;)<br />Occasional signs of how much  racism and moral relativism remains are found in some of the angrier  negative reviews above (another indication of the great value of  Hochschild's work). Apparently unable to refute Hochschild's main thesis,  one reviewer carps about details such as the photographs, then launches  into an argument that is every bit as morally bankrupt as the old saw about  how Hitler was good because he made the trains run on time:<br />&quot;Does  the author has realized that leprosy, sleeping disease, endemic wars  between tribes have created more havoc in Congo before and during the time  that king Leopold was sending Stanley to follow the Congo  valley?&quot;<br />Of course, there were wars in Germany before the rise of  the Third Reich, and in Russia before the October Revolution. Are we  therefore to excuse Hitler and Stalin? This book's negative reviews have  deepened my own experience of the book by reminding me that the sources of  the evils Hochschild describes are still lurking among us.
B00001OH7N|5.0|Space Oddity the lp does not prepare you for what you find here.David is a very capable heavy-rocker.Mick Ronson (RIP) and Trevor Bolder are the prominent musicians here (well I have the Ryko release- something doesn't  seem right about the Ryko mastering)the drums are hardly noticeable.The  lyrics are typical sci fi/art school/doomsday material.Bowie's acoustic  guitar is as prominent as Ronson's electric.Best songs are tracks 1,2,6  &amp; 7. This is not a pure hard rock album but it does point towards  Bowie's future concepts.&quot;She Shook Me Cold&quot; is incredible.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Being familiar with Moby's earlier work, I was shocked, surprised, and very pleased with this CD.  It isn't often that an artist can re-invent their sound so radically.  Rather than the techno sound we're used to, this  one has a blues-y, melodic feel.  Plus, every song has a different sound  rather than the repetitive drivel produced by some musicians.  This one  pretty much stays in my truck's CD changer.<br />Love it!

1559351209|2.0|This audio version of the long beloved masterpiece  is impressive in its inclusion of the entirety of the original three books. Scenes that all of the movies and all of the other audio versions have left out for whatever  reasons are presented here at last, including the Old Forest and Tom  Bombadil, and the Barrow Downs scenes. Even in the face of this laudable  boldness I am compelled to say I hated it from beginning to end. The  production sounds as though a bunch of somnambulant old men with no acting  skills whatsoever were dragged into a closet filled with expensive digital  recording equipment and forced to read a script which they have never seen  before. It appears that no attempt was made at casting or direction in  spite of the obvious effort to include nearly the whole of the three  books.I highly recommend anybody considering the purchase of an audio  dramatization of TLOTR to consider the BBC Radio version also available at  this site, in spite of a few sadly missing scenes the production is much  better.
B00000DMJF|5.0|Brilliant, uneven, inspiring, maddening...the Beatles' White Album is all of this and more.  Thirty songs and two discs long, this 1968 release is the greatest rock album ever recorded.<br />Which, of course, is not entirely  fair to say, considering that it isn't merely a rock album; the project  spans genres as erratically as an encyclopedia does subjects.  There's  rock, of course.  And pop, sure.  But let's not forget country, blues, and  vaudevillian jazz.  This record could easily have its picture in Webster's  next to the definition for &quot;inconsistent,&quot; all of which makes it  all the more breathtaking...in less than two hours we're given ample  examples of the capacities of rock's most revered band.<br />The pop/rock  behind &quot;Back in the USSR,&quot; &quot;While My Guitar Gently  Weeps,&quot; &quot;Birthday,&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; make them  easy sells and undisputable classics.  But when the Fab Four unveil the  quiet folk of &quot;Blackbird&quot; (believed by some to be written about  Civil Rights and Black empowerment), the result is one of striking and  poignant beauty.  The same could be said about &quot;Julia,&quot; another  arty ballad that would make any songwriter jealous.<br />Other songs are  quirky; the tall tales behind &quot;The Continuing Story of Bungalow  Bill&quot; and &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; stand tall among rock's most  inventive tunes.   &quot;Honey Pie&quot; is a charming ditty that sounds  straight out of the roaring Twenties, and &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; is  nearly impossible to classify but just as impossible to resist.  <br />And  there's a healthy helping of songs that are just plain out there.   &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; could be about anything, or  nothing...or both.  &quot;Why Don't We Do it in the Road&quot; and  &quot;Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey&quot; each  manage major hooks, in spite of the fact that each song has a lyrical theme  shorter than their titles.   Lyrically clear but just as left-field is  &quot;Piggies,&quot; which takes social satire to a deceivingly  cheerful-sounding extreme.  But the only truly unlistenable moment is  &quot;Revolution 9,&quot; an eight-minute excursion into the realm of  performance art...Yoko is no doubt at fault, at least partially.<br />However,  the most telling element of this album's brilliance is the ability it gives  to tell where bands and artists that came after the Beatles found  inspiration within it.  Led Zeppelin no doubt learned a lot from &quot;Yer  Blues,&quot; and Sheryl Crow owes just as much to the likes of &quot;Savoy  Truffle&quot; as she does to her beloved Rolling Stones.  Then again, there  aren't many bands or artists who don't owe a huge debt to the Beatles, rock  or otherwise.  The fearless experimentation and variety of this record  showcases everything brilliant about the Beatles, making the White Album  the greatest and most essential rock album of all time.
0767824571|5.0|This movie is outrageously hilarious.  If &quot;Excalibur&quot; is the definative movie-telling of the Authur Legend, then Monty Python's Holy Grail is the Ultimate Parody.<br />From the &quot;horses&quot; that lead to a  discussion of sparrows, to the three-headed giant, to the French Knights,  to the Brave Sir Robin, you will be left laughing til your sides  hurt.<br />The DVD version of the movie restores the portions of the screen  cut off by the pan-and-scan process.  The Python troupe notoriously used  the big screen to their fullest advantage.  You can now SEE things that  could only be heard in the VHS version.  And hearing gets better too thanks  to Dolby Sound.<br />Granted, this is dry English humor with a bit of  gratitous violence... so it may not be for everyone... but:<br />If you are a  fan of the Aurthur Legend or just like off-the-wall comedy, this is a must  see for you.
B00004T9UF|5.0|From beginning to end, this is one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time. Not for the easily offended folks, of course. Eminem spares no one, no topic too taboo for him. Which, to me, is part of his smart-ass charm.  Have we started living in such a PC world that we've forgotten how to laugh  at the things around us, forgotten how to laugh at ourselves? I predict  Eminem is right when he says there's a little Slim Shady lurking in all of  us. Plus, the song &quot;Stan&quot; is a major highlight of many on this  impressive album. Don't wait, run out and get this CD!
B000002KD9|5.0|This is one of the top ten albums ever done.  &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, is timeless.  Especially today, we talk about semiconductors, biotech, nuclear energy and congratulate ourselves for the  &quot;great&quot; economy with little or no regard to the environment.   &quot;Southern Man&quot; is more of a period piece.  The South has changed  a LOT since 1970; heck, it's changed a lot since 1995!  &quot;Don't forget  what your good book says.&quot;  Lynyrd Skynyrd should have looked around  before their retort to this song in &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;.  Being  non-white and having grown up in the South, I tend to agree with Neil Young  a bit more.<br />The rest of the album is lyrically and musically strong as  well, hence, a classic!
B00004SCX6|5.0|I liked it a lot. Overall, it is better than the first one. Some songs are more mature, some are not but she is still a teenager. Her voice may be the  worst compared to other teen singers but it works well with these style of  songs. Don't take this kind of music seriously. It is for fun...not for  Grammy. It is entertaining and that is the most important. Enjoy!

B000002UB3|5.0|All too often in entertainment, whether it's music, television, or a series of sequels for a movie, it usually seems like the absolute lowest common denominator must explored before the idea at hand can be put to  rest.  Bands and storylines run out of steam way before they throw in the  towel.  Not so with the Beatles, who came up with some of their most  compelling and exciting material for &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; their last  studio recording as a foursome.<br />As with any Beatles album, the songs that  have crept their way into music lover's consciousness are far more than  those which were actually released as singles; so legendary is their work  and so thorough is the love of their fans that more than half of each album  could be considered a &quot;hit&quot; in one way or another.  &quot;Abbey  Road&quot; is surely no exception.  The record boasts such classics as  &quot;Come Together,&quot; &quot;Something,&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the  Sun,&quot; but the term &quot;album filler&quot; was apparently coined  after the Beatles broke up.  <br />&quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy),&quot;  with all the time signature changes and polished solos, still ranks as one  of their finest rockers.  The bluesy &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; is another  treasure, starting off as a smooth, dreamy plea for love but ending up a  lung-testing belter of pure romantic desperation.  And for those who favor  the Beatles' tall tales, the sinister &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot;  and the innocent, childlike &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; will surely do the  trick.<br />The second half of the album is a seamless suite of songs divided  only by the CD tracks.  &quot;Sun King&quot; is the mellow intro (the  foreign language segment no doubt had an influence on Queen), followed by  the infectious character studies &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot; and  &quot;Polythene Pam.&quot;  Fan favorite &quot;She Came in Through the  Bathroom Window&quot; is also part of the set, proving that each individualentry works as a song of its own.  In the same mindset, &quot;You Never  Give Me Your Money&quot; actually sounds like two compositions in one;  around the two-and-a-half minute mark the musical and lyrical theme  changes, and &quot;one sweet dream came true today&quot; is surely just as  memorable a hook as the song's title segment.<br />In a nutshell, it's another  Beatles album that's virtually without fault (even though John Lennon was  quoted as saying he hated it). &quot;Abbey Road&quot; may be a bit sad  since it signals the end of rock's greatest band, but it's also an undying  testament to their brilliance, as our four favorite boys from across the  pond stayed on top of their game right to the very end.  Like the lyric  says, &quot;in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you  make.&quot; If that's true, the Beatles' lives were very full indeed.
B00003W8NM|5.0|The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club and the second rule is don't talk about Fight Club. So all I am going to say is that this is the best film ever and definitely a film you will watch over and over  and over. Buy it like a good little consumer.
0060196122|4.0|After I finished this book, I gained a great power to struggle for life. During the time I was reading this book, I was sad and histeric about the personalities of the book. I reccommend this book to all people who are in  doubt about human life. I also become very glad because Mr. Cuelho will  come to my country IRAN.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem, new CD is overly tyte.  The beats are tyte, and the lyrics, while sometimes dusturbing, are tyte and well delivererd.  If you like good music, get this cd, If you hate icp, get this cd, by the way, GET THIS CD,  you won't be disapointed
6303913881|4.0|I have heard many times that women go through an awful lot and do things they don't want to do just to make it to the top. This is portrayed very well in 'Showgirls' as Nomi(Elizabeth Berkley) a drifter, travels to Vegas  to become a renowned dancer-only to to discover that to get to the top, you  have to sell your soul. As the film opens we see Nomi on her way to Vegas  with everything she owns, full of hope and excitement over realizing her  dream of being a showgirl at on of Vegas's prestigious hotels. But as she  arrives in Vegas, all of her possessions are stolen. She is found and taken  in by a sweet, soft-spoken girl named Molly(poignantly portrayed by virtual  unknown Gina Ravera). Instead of taking the time to look into her showgirl  dream, Nomi is forced to take the first job available just to  survive-lapdancing at a cheapie strip joint. Meanwhile Molly and Nomi  become like sisters and Molly introduces Nomi as a prospective dancer in  the Stardust hotel's elaborate stage production &quot;Goddess&quot; to the  lead dancer in &quot;Goddess&quot;, a talented woman named Cristal(Gina  Gershon). At first Cristal is unimpressed because Nomi's only professional  experience is at a low-class low-budget strip joint. But then Cristal and  her right hand man, the sleazy sex fiend Zach Carey(Kyle Maclachlan), go to  the Cheetah to see Nomi's dancing abilities for themselves. After seeing  Nomi's talent for themselves, they are so impressed that Cristal uses her  connections and gets Nomi into &quot;Goddess&quot; as a chorus girl. Nomi's  dream is finally coming true, but she soon discovers that what she wanted  comes with too high a price. She is asked to take drugs to improve her  agility on the stage and is asked to sleep with wealthy customers for the  sake of business and money. A rivalry begins as Cristal starts to feel  threatened by the high recognition that Nomi recieves for her performance  on the stage, and Nomi is forced to play dirty to protect her  position-ultimately resulting in Nomi's intended injury of Cristal. Nomi's  rising greed and ambition alienate Molly, and Nomi finds herself more and  more isolated and lonely. Finally, Molly shows up at a party given to  celebrate Nomi's rising fame-and is brutally raped by three men that Nomi  introduced her to. It takes this tragedy to make Nomi realize how  destructive her greed and ambition are; they have hurt not only her, but  the people that she is closest to. Nomi's anguish and conflict as she rises  higher and higher to the top are portrayed well here. As she rises she is  forced more each day to become someone that she doesn't like just to make  it to the top, which results in bitterness and depression. This is true of  real-life showbiz today, so congrats to Berkley and writers for a good  thought provoking depiction of showbiz's dark side. Although the acting is  excellent and the sleziness of show business is portrayed very well, I have  given 'Showgirls' four stars instead of five because I feel that Molly's  rape scene should not have been so in depth. They should have just shown  the men coming at her, given us a scream from far off in the distance, and  then forwarded to Molly's hospital scene. Rape is a serious thing, and  showing the entire ordeal on screen for big bucks is insensitive not only  to women but to other sex crime victims as well. But otherwise...good  movie, good cast performances, good showbiz sleaze portrayal. 'Showgirls'  is an excellent, well-acted expose of the many problems in the showbiz  industry today-enjoy!
B000002J1S|5.0|Actually I'm not a fan of Genesis. But fan of Peter Gabriel's genius. I've bought it two month ago because of Peter. The impression was awful. So now I have to discover other Genesis albums before PG's leaving.  My favorites  are &quot;In The Cage&quot; (it's very interesting, how could it sound  together with an orchestra?  - my dream), &quot;Grand Parade Of Lifeless  Packaging&quot; (like a march), etc. (God... I love all of them) &amp;  &quot;Broadway Melody Of 1974&quot; althrough it's very short, it takes you  somewhere... I can't explain.  I listen this album every day &amp; can't  get enough. Can you believe?     The best thematic album ever made.  Something average between Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;The  Final Cut&quot;... plus briliant Peter Gabriel.
0060930187|3.0|It was interesting and sad. I was expecting better becase I had heard so much about it. I loved all of Sylvia's metaphors and similes, the book is very well written, but it left me looking for more, for some kind of  resolution.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I was one of the first to buy this today. It's one of the coolest cd i've listened to.  This cd pretty much concentrates on the anger eminem(aka slim shady) has for everyone he hates.  The raps are still kept cool.  I love  this album. The best songs are Kill You, The Real Slim Shady, I'm Back,  Marshall Mathers and Criminal.  Steve Berman and Ken Kaniff are also very  funny skits.
B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols consisted of a couple of pub rockers 'only in it for the birds', a heroin addict, and an intellectual. They did absolutely nothing new with rock music except take a great big blowtorch and burn it to the  ground. Death by three chord thrash. Electrifying.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I could not agree and disagree with Katherine more. This is, as it's predecessor, an awesome album. They are able to capture the attention of people who like rock, or metal, or alternative, or even pop. They have a  style that reminds you of others, but is distinctly their own. The crack  that Human Clay is redundant tells me that Katherine is no fan of their  music. However it is, Creed is a band that will have endurance, just as I  still buy Metallica after almost twenty years of playing, I envision I will  still be buying Creed (should they continue producing) twenty years from  now.
0312955006|5.0|The Concrete Blonde tells one of many tales regarding Detective Harry Bosch. He is currently in court for the reckless murder of a supposed serial killer named the Dollmaker. But he gets a note saying he killed the  wrong man and now must track down the new killer while being in  court.<br />This novel is a personal one of sorts for Harry as he conflicts  with his current girlfriend, Sylvia. Harry must battle his personal and  business conflicts simultaneously.<br />The Concrete Blonde supplies us with a  fast moving, intense read that keeps us wondering until the end. Connelly  has managed to describe a single character superbly in Bosch. I plan on  reading all the Bosch novels to get caught up with this great character.
B00003CX5A|5.0|After viewing this on dvd, I feel a strange sence of a &quot;pain in the neck&quot;. Its well made, with a storyline to keep your eyes on the screen for the whole lenth of the film, witch (hint, hint) as some parts horror  and others full of storyline...... feel sorry for the tree though.
B000002GB9|5.0|Another reviewer mentioned that this music and album is dated.  Well when  I listen it comes across to me that it was ahead of its time.  If it is  dated then so am I.  I really still enjoy this CD and think a lot of new  listeners will enjoy the power and energy that all of these tracks have.<br />Paradise Theatre is another great album and it is 3 years newer than the  Grand Illusion and to me it sounds more dated.  But I think in a way thats  one of the reasons I like it.  (not necessarily all tunes sound dated, some  more than others)
6303314015|5.0|This is the best movie I have ever seen. Disney really outdid themselves. This movie will never be topped by Disney or anyone else. This has the best story of any movie to date. The story is a classic in itself. The  characters are timeless and unforgettable. Not only does it have a great  story and great characters it has a beautiful soundtrack. Who can forget  the words to Circle of Life or Can You Feel The Love Tonight. This movie is  truly a masterpeice.
B00003A9QI|3.0|I bought this CD because I could not get the MAIN THEME out of my head (since they played it in OSCARS) so many times.  I liked the main theme, and the other tracks that included that melody.  But the other tracks  weren't so catchy and it sounded like a big blur.
B000000XB9|5.0|This is truly the ultimate CCR Greatist Hits. I mean Chronicle Vol.2 is  good as well, but this one takes the cake. It has an amazing 20 songs. All  of them are excellent. Personally my favorite is Fortunate Son. I give it 5  stars. This is stainboy signing off.
B0000028M7|5.0|I bought this CD in 1997 because I heard Rooster on the radio.  I just had to hear that tune again.  I really thought that I would hate this band. (I am a classic rock fan and judged them by their name)  Oh how wrong I was.  Aside from being a bit dark and dreary and depressing at times I found this  to be a very worthy band and cd.  There is some serious talent here.  I  quickly rushed out and bought all of there stuff and like most of it.  This  one is probably my favorite being close to jar of flies.  Jar of flies is  actually a relief after dirt because it is not so intense,  but dirt is  very powerful and is really fun to crank on the stereo.  By the  way.....soundgarden is really not in any league with this band.  They have  a few catchy tunes,  but these guys are real talent.  Too bad they are not  making music now.<br />Down in a hole is one of the best individual tunes to  come along in many years.
0441172717|5.0|I don't think I need to say much.  I've read most of the best books sci-fi and fantasy have produced, and I would say Dune is to SF what The Lord of the Rings is to fantasy.  Simply incomparable.  I just wish high school  English teachers would take it up as a subject of study in lit classes.  It  would be a hell of a lot more interesting than To Kill A Mockingbird.
B00003CX5A|4.0|This DVD is worth owning solely for the fact that it looks so darn good. I can't even explain how good it looks. I could watch it over and over because of this. The headless horseman is about as realistic as a man  without a head can get. The special effects and CG are stunning. The same  can't be said for the story unfortunately. Especially the second half when  it all starts coming together. I still reccomend this film to anyone who  appreciates a good decapitation, and to any Tim Burton fan.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|SIMPLY AWSOME.  THIS IS OLD SCHOOL ROCK AT IT'S BEST!
B000001FVL|5.0|This CD brings back many memories of the 80's. The light-hearted, fun-filled pop sound of The Buggles hit &quot;Video Killed The Radio Star&quot; has never left my memory.  And if you think of it..... the title  even holds some truth, to the music of the 90's. Listen to the words. This  video and song was one of the first entrancers to the age of pop music and  MTV. I loved this song so much, I once dressed as the &quot;Radio  Star&quot; from the video for a Halloween party. Hear it, feel it, dance to  it - and you'll never forget it!
B000003BEM|5.0|I got this album with its sanitized cover for Christmas in 1968, along with the Beatles White Album, and at the time preferred it.  You want your profundity, you got Sympathy for the Devil.  You want your social  commentary, you got Salt of the Earth. You want the Stones vote on bein' a  radical, you got the awesome and unique Street Fighting Man.  Time passed,  and I lost the album.  Picking up the CD today, what strikes me is that  this is probably their richest album MUSICALLY, and indeed it is timeless.  The headliner songs are still great, but what makes this album worth owning  (rather than just cherrypicking the hits on best of albums) are the other  cuts, which are primarily acoustic and slide blues.  Cuts like Prodigal Son  and Parachute Woman, and the sublime No Expectations don't get  anthologized, and don't get played on the radio, but they are the very soul  of the Rolling Stones, the calling card they will present when they knock  on the door of St. Peter's.  A rewarding musical experience.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This new cd by slim shady is tight.  The skits are hilarious, the lyrics are clever and harsh, the beats incredible, and em's flow is great.  every track has a catchy hook, and i like how the majority of the tracks feature  shady solo.  however, the track that features dre, snoop, nate dogg and  exibit is incredible as well.  eminem improves with his second release, and  everyone should pick this cd up.
B00004T9UF|5.0|If you are a fan of music, this is an album that needs to be in the collection.  This album has something for everyone, except maybe for little impressionable kids.  The dope beats that are pressed down by Dre and  Eminem make this an instant classic, ala &quot;The Chronic&quot; and  &quot;The Chronic 2001&quot;.  Along with the beats, the songs have  choruses that'll have you rapping to yourself all day long.  The lyrics are  something else.  He pretty much offends everybody with his amazingly witty  rhymes full of disses and comebacks.  This, the second of Em's mainstream  albums proves that he is here to stay and that his style and his attitude  will stick around as well.  Check out, Track #'s 2,3,5,8,11,12,14,17,18.   Get this CD, it's money well spent.  The only bad thing about this album is  trying to get the catchy tunes out your head.  Being the only complaint,  Em's sophomore album is a great follow-up to his first, but how can he top  this?  Every year there are more and more little pop stars to offendend and  dope beats being invented.  Eminem provides laughs while forcing us to move  to his beats.  He'll be back!
B00004SCX6|4.0|Oops I did it again is a pretty good CD. Here is what I think about all of her songs.......&quot;Oops I did it again&quot; is quite a good song, very up tempo and has a really catchy toon. &quot;Stronger&quot; I can tell is  the new side of Britney Spears that she said she would have in her new CD,  it's pretty good!&quot;Don't go Kockin' on my door&quot; also has that new  sound, but this song is also pretty good! &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is okay,  but it reminds me of disco and the end of the song repeats itself over and  over again with the same lyrics and it gets king of boring. &quot;Don't Let  me be the Last to know&quot; is a sweet song that has a nice tune.  &quot;What you see is What you get&quot; is a good song also ,but is also  has that same new sound that she is trying, but it still sounds really  cool! &quot;Lucky&quot; is one of my favorite songs on the album. It has  good lyrics, a good melody, and creativity. &quot;One kiss from You&quot;  sounds like it would be on her old album, so if you liked her old album you  will like the song. &quot;Where are you know&quot; is a very mellow song,  but it has a lot of meaning. It's the kind of song that you could fall  asleep at night listening to. &quot;Can't make you love me&quot; OHHHH!  I  LOVE THAT SONG! it's my favorite. Everything about that song is cool! I  LOVE it. &quot;When your eyes say it&quot; YUCK! I don't really like that  song at all, it's very.....boring, and the music is very....well.....boring  and old. &quot;Dear Diary&quot;, well good job Britney, that song is good!  You first time writing a song and it was sucsessful! It's a very sweet song  about a boy that this girl saw and she wonders if he noticed her cause he  is really cute! Thats my review, and I thought the CD is really good!
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem new cd the marshall mathers lp is just an example of how he can spit out triple platinum material every time he puts out a song or album this album  has a wide varitey of of beats and lyrics basically he is funny  and every thing ryhmes you should grab his first cd and this i own both and  i cant stop listening to the he isnt &quot;the&quot; best buit he is up  there. Get this album now
0793518326|5.0|This is an amazingly complete and accurate collection... musicians attempting to learn and to replicate the Beatles sound will not be disappointed.  Included are all instrument parts, all vocal parts, and  chord names above the staff, with tablature for the bass and guitar parts.   What a bargain!  <br />At times, the authors were able to capture some  subtlties in the music which had gone unnoticed by me... but a careful  re-listening to the song revealed the score to be surprisingly correct.   <br />Regarding some of the complaints in other Amazon reviews, which made me  a bit hesitant to buy:<br />1) Size of the print:  it really is not that  small, and it is quite legible.<br />2) Supposed inaccuracy of chord names: it  appears that there is a general chord name above the staff, but more  detailed guitar-part scoring in the staff... they were not trying to name  the exact chord every time... in some cases not every string is being  played.<br />3) Complaints about the inclusion of 'tab' for 'musical  illiterates':  tab actually includes, concisely, information which standard  notation cannot show easily... like exactly which string/fret to use, out  of several options on the guitar.  And, by the way, Paul McCartney STILL  does not read or write standard notation himself.<br />NOTE: I also compared  this book to Hal Leonard's &quot;The Beatles&quot; (21 songs, in their  &quot;Transcribed Scores&quot; series), and was amazed how much better The  Beatles Complete Scores is.
0783225849|5.0|Psycho is one of the greatest suspense/horror movies of all-time. Directed by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, this psychological thriller has all the elements of a great film. First off, the casting and acting  were very well done. Janet Leigh was good in the role of Marion Crane, but  I believe a lot of credit goes to Anthony Perkins in his role as the  infamous Norman Bates. The sound/music, the lighting, and the setting of  the movie all contributed to an eerie atmosphere that was captivating. Even  though Psycho was released in 1960 in black &amp; white, it ranks as one of  my favorite movies from that era. <br />This movie sort of combines two  stories in one: the troubles of Marion Crane with her employer and the  troubles of Norman Bates with his mother. Both are nicely connected  together into a brilliant screenplay that was aptly directed by Hitchcock.  Psycho leads the viewer through a bizarre series of events, culminating in  an unexpected revelation at the end, which truly makes the movie worthwhile  and explains why the movie is called &quot;Psycho&quot;. You'll have to  watch it to see what I mean. The only other suspense/horror movie of the  same era which is comparable to Psycho -- in my opinion -- is The Birds,  another Hitchcock classic.  <br />If you have not seen this movie yet, go to  your local video store and rent it. I guarantee that you will not be  disappointed. If you are tired of watching pitiful modern-day horror movies  like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, watch Psycho for some  quality cinema entertainment. And don't bother with the 1998 remake  starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche -- it comes nowhere near the  originality and suspensefulness of the 1960 classic. A must-see for any  movie-watcher.
B00000J7J4|5.0|This is one of the sexist albums I have ever owned. I love Santana's trademark guiter coupled with various artists, such as Rob Thomas, Lauryn Hill and Everlast.<br />The vocals are phenonmenal and the beat just changes  the mood.<br />Great album for just hanging out in the summer.
0440219078|5.0|I think that The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is a fantastic book about a  supposedly &quot;Perfect&quot; world which in most cases isn't always so  Perfect. Some people think that with ignorance comes no pain, but the  author proves how this is completely untrue.<br />The author shows the life of  an eleven year old boy--properly called an 'Eleven' who is soon to become a  'Twelve' and find out what he is to become or&quot;What is to become of  him&quot; He is chosen to become the Receiver of Memory, the most important  and honorable role in the Community. He is to learn all secrets and  memories of life including ones that are most enjoyable, and some that give  the most excruciating pain.<br />The author describes the upside and downside  of this world. The upside is that no one can make a mistake,for example;  someone may choose a job they don't like,or the wrong spouse, and people  may have alot of children then there would not be enough food. But you  see,that doesn't happen in this world, in this world everything is chosen,  or set out for you and you can't make a simple decision like: What color  shirt should I wear today? Namely: the Downside.<br />This book is great  because it made me feel the pain of ignorance, the joy of learning, and the  love between a teacher and a student. This is a WONDERFUL book and I  recommend it to anyone who enjoys wonderfully written books.
B00001QEBQ|3.0|When the movie trailers for this film came out, I thought, &quot;GREAT!  Finally an animated epic adventure from Disney!  Looks to be better than Sleeping Beauty.&quot;<br />But it's not.<br />Mulan is a comedy.  Sure, it's the  tale of a girl in search of herself, but her sidekicks (Mu Shu and Krikee)  steal the show.  And the sidekicks are only on the screen to be funny.    Don't get me wrong, they are funny!  I constantly recite Mu Shu's lines...  <BR> But...<BR> The plot of Mulan was a bit too predictable.<br />The  animation quality is excellent and the sound (on DVD) is THX... meaning  it's the BEST.  But this isn't enough  to make a great film.<br />If you're  looking for a Disney comedy, this is a good movie for you.  But if you are  looking for an animated adventure, go find &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; or  &quot;Watership Down.&quot;
B00004RFFU|3.0|I enjoyed it but I must subtract one star for Cruise, subtract two stars for Pitt's performance, and add one for Banderas.
B00004RHZU|4.0|It is rare to find good R&amp;B singers theses days. But I was blown away by this album. Pink is only 19 and has truly amazing vocal talents!<br />I like the unusual take on topics of love and even introducing Split  Personality (one of the songs). If you like Lisa Stansfield with an endge,  this is it!
0440219078|5.0|I just finished reading the best book that I have read in the6th grade.  It is entitled &quot;The Giver&quot; and was wonderfullywritten by Lois lowery.  This amazing book was about a boy named Jonas and the difficulties that he faces while in training to become the Receiver of Memory.  I am going to inform you about the great and horrible obstacles that happen in this book.  I think that it was a wonderful sensation when The Giver gave Jonas the good memories because now Jonas knows what love and hapiness are.  I also thought that the author did a wonderful job making it heart-warming when The Giver talked about Rose-Mary because that is when he (The Giver) felt love.  He talked about that because Jonas asked many questions about her.  It was aslo wonderful that Jonas could feel and understand the Giver because no one else could. My eyes were glued to the book ... To find out what happens with Jonas, The Giver and Gabe read The Giver and maybe you will agree with me that a sequel is needed or maybe just a little more information at the end of the book because the author is not very specific.
0440219078|5.0|After having read this book 3 times, I get more out of thisbook every time. I have learned a lot of things such as how importantchoice is, how boring life would be with everything the same and how much I enjoy making mistakes. Instead of reading this book for plesure I read it to learn about life and to study a life where chocies are made for you and nothing bad ever happens. I liked this book a lot!
B0000028PI|3.0|Most of these songs are GREAT and really have a lot going for them.  The only thing really dragging them down a bit is the performance which is slightly weak.  Decent, but could have been better.
0060977493|5.0|I did not want to read this book, but luckily, I was required to.  Roy's prose was so lyrical that I had to keep reading until the story itself would not let me stop.  In the beginning, the rain is not just coming down,  it is &quot;slanting silver ropes slammed into the loose earth, plowing it  up like gunfire.&quot;  Roy's observations of people are so on target, that  the reader will understand and know the characters immediately.  The twists  and turns and how things turn out will leave you thinking about this book  for a long time.
B00004T8RK|5.0|With a delicate arrangement of meaningful love songs, political overtones, haunting sounds, and upbeat rock, this band has now officially, (at least in my mind) staked its claim for a spot in the rock hall of fame. Yes,  right alongside the Beatles, and Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd, and the  Doors, and Neil Young, and the Who. Binaural starts heavy and fast, much  like Vitalogy, but after the first two or three songs, its sound is unlike  anything PJ has ever done. There's the string arrangement of Parting Ways,  the ukelele in Soon Forget, and a peotic entrancement called Sleight of  Hand. McCready's lead guitar takes over a couple of slow songs, while  Cameron's drums create the power behind the rockers. With changing tempos,  a unique production, and some of the most thought-provoking Vedder lyrics  ever, this album will stand higher than anything to recently come out of  the music world. Mark my words, in 20 years, our kids will be digging  through our old CD collections looking for this album. Hopefully they don't  find any Korn or Creed.
B00003CXDV|4.0|If you like Star Trek, AND you have a sense of humor, you'll like this movie. It really does show a lot of the classic parodies on the series, including the man in the red shirt. It's not as funny as Spaceballs, but  still very good. The only problem I had was, it had a period of about 45  minutes, where it got too serious, and not as funny. Aside from that, it  was very good.
B000001FA4|4.0|For die hard U2 fans this CD is a must because it links old rock U2 with the more post-modern U2 sounds of Actung Baby, Zooropa, etc. The focus of this album is the range of sonic sounds and the vast emotions that they  represent. Brian Eno co-produces this album and really takes U2's talent to  the next level in this experimental CD. Rock classics are found in Bad,  Pride, and Sort of Homecoming while sleeper hits are MLK, Promenade, and  the title track are great as well. Pay attention to the lyrics, atmosphere  (thanks to rich multilayering of tracks with various keys), and of course  the bands execution. In summary, this is an album best appreciated after  listening to other U2 works like War, Actung Baby, or Joshua Tree.
B000046PVN|5.0|&quot;Superman:The Movie&quot; is definitely the best score John Williams has ever written.  Now with the release of this expanded edition, I can appreciate the soundtrack that tops all the other titles in my collection  in its fullest form.  This is a CD that should be in every collection. It's  popular, classical.  It's a feast to every listener
0140366822|5.0|This is one of my favorite children's books because it tells a great truth.  Finding something to be glad about isn't always easy, but it's better than sitting around feeling sorry for yourself.  I'm far from  mastering this Glad Game, but Pollyanna makes me want to try harder to be  GLAD, and less often to be sad.
6303471501|4.0|This is the first of the Mad Max trilogy and was widely touted as one of the early Australian films that came anywhere near contending with Hollywood at the box office.  It is worth watching, even in the concededly  awful dubbed over version, just to get the background to the later (and far  superior) _Road Warrior_.<br />In fact, _Mad Max_ is so overshadowed by the  second film in the series that it is sometimes difficult to see it as more  than a prequel.<br />This film does, however, stand by itself.  The villains  are actually far more sinister and psychotic than those in _The Road  Warrior_, and the disintegration of society is more appalling.  Here, Max  is still striving to uphold law and order but is pushed into vigilantism as  a part of the same inexorable decay.<br />The final scene/encounter is a  classic, and a great segue to the next film.<br />Editing and continuity are  just a bit off, and the dub over is distracting.  But see this before  moving on to _The Road Warrior_.
B000003TA2|5.0|Well, now as I write this, it is the year 2000. This album, Goo, is 10 years old. I just got it 2 days ago. The first time I listened to it, I was a bit dubious, I had heard &quot;Dirty Boots&quot; before and I love that  song, and it was the main reason I bought this album. But, I can't stop  listening to it! I am a big Nirvana fan, and I had heard of Sonic Youth,  but I had never heard anything by Sonic Youth, and I can see why Nirvana  and especially Kurt Cobain respected them so much. This album is sheer  genius. The music is great and the lyrics are great and the singing is  great - it's just great, really great. All the songs are just brilliant.  Dirty Boots, Tunic, Mote, all stick out for me, and Mildred Pierce, as it  lulls you into a false sense of security with it's melodic, instrumental  beginning and then suddenly turns on you and becomes almost like a death  metal song. Great. I really can't say enough good things for this album.  But if Kurt Cobain thought they were so good, with his talent, they can't  be bad, can they...?
B00004SCX6|2.0|Ok, this CD (for most part) is like having your computer sing to you. There are soo much synthesizer and sound effects in lots of the songs. The  lyrics are good for most part, that's where the two stars came from. One  Ops was ok, but making the fast track songs similar to Ops or Baby One More  Time is just too much. In regards to Britney CO-WRITING one song, that's  nice but it does not make her the most talented person in the music  industry. I would say Mariah Carey, the Jackson's, Madonna, even the new  group M2M has more talent in that department than Britney. She's  co-writing, not writing and arranging the music. Christina Aguilera, who  also co-wrote or wrote one song, is more talented in regards to voice  quality. Even if Christina didn't write a single song, she sounds great  with just a piano.
0790741512|5.0|This excellent movie could easily have come across as a cartoon.  But it doesn't.<br />A compact, post-Apocalyptic classic, this film is the core of the Mad Max trilogy and by far the best of the three in every sense.  Neatly framed by a haunting narrative delivered years after the events in  the film, this is a complete story of imperfect redemption.  Mel Gibson as  Max (a reprise from his role in the earlier _Mad Max_) is the classic  anti-hero.  His motives are mixed.  He does not get the girl.  He barely  survives, in fact, and the last we see of him is standing bloodied but  unbowed and defiant amid a field of wreckage-at sundown, appropriately  enough.<br />There are so many great characters and lines in this movie that  it would be impossible to review them all in 1,000 words.  I will just  mention Bruce Spence as the Gyrocaptain, and Emil Minty, as the Feral Kid.  Spence is the \\"sidekick,\\" bringing a bit of comic relief in a wonderfully  acted part.  Minty is the sort of surrogate for the son lost in _Mad Max_,  and the spiritual hand-off from &quot;father&quot; to &quot;son&quot; at  the end of the story is poignant.<br />There are some great plot twists for  anyone lucky enough to be seeing this for the first time, as well as irony  by the bucketful.  Perhaps the strongest point of the film is its gritty,  unsentimental realism.  The bad guys don't win, but neither are they  totally wiped out.  The \\"heroes,\\" in large part, don't survive.  The  spiritually flawed somehow eke through, leaving us with a bit of a murky  moral.<br />A brooding soundtrack and excellent cinematography round out what  is in every sense a classic film.
B000002J1S|5.0|I fell into this album quite accidentally several years ago as a fan of Genesis' later (and much more commercial) work.  This is a wide-ranging, musically dense, confounding and emotionally powerful work which gives me  chills even now when I listen to it.  If you don't love this album, don't  bother to explore the &quot;art rock&quot; genre any further.
B0000025RI|5.0|Michael Jackson has done many good things during his career with the Jackson 5 and as a solo artist.  However, this recording ranks as his upmost greatest accomplishment.  There are nine songs on this record and  SEVEN of them were released as singles.  As someone else remarked, go find  that today.  And each of the songs show a different side of Michael.  The  Girl Is Mine is a fine duet with Paul McCartney showing that Michael can  croon with the best of them.  Beat It is my personal fave as the  instrumentation really rocks.  And how about Eddie Van Halen's awesome  guitar solo.  PYT(Pretty Young Thing) is a nice bouncy pop song and Lady Of  My Life is a slick soulful ballad.  I could go on and on about the other  five songs but the key here is this record has balance, style, emotion,  force, and soul and a whole lot more.  This one is quite deserving of its  greatest seller accomplishment although I have some other records I like  more.  But not too many!  Anyway, its pretty essential for almost any  collection so get it if you haven't, OK?
0780622553|4.0|Don't think too much about this film.  Proyas was'nt stupid enought to make this remake of Metropolis any more than it was - A lot of fun.  A little darker than it's predecessor this film from a special efffects  standpoint will keep you moving and wondering why the entire time.  Not too  often can a film use the morphing of buildings, low light, and clocks to  move along the plot as those conventions did in this film.  They effects  were not just making a point but telling a story of their own in an odd  sort of way.<br />This film could be watched without a soundtrack and still be  a lot of fun.  The acting by Mr. Sewell was great as usual and his  supporting cast held their own.  One could make a case for a better casting  choice in the Keifer Sutherland role, but he does'nt ruin the film.<br />Dark  City plays like a fortysomething detective story as we are led through the  confusion of Sewell's character to exactly what the heck is going on.  The  twists are fun and inventive (however predictable if you know the source),  but an interesting watch nevertheless.<br />The transfer to DVD is'nt as crisp  as one would have liked.  Given the low light filming sometimes the digital  pixals are pretty obvious.  Maybe our friends at the Criterion Collection  will get their hands on the original and provide us with a brilliant  rendition.
B00003Q438|5.0|The Abyss is one of the best DVD ever made, it as the Original Version of The film and the Director Cuts, that has 29 minutes more.<br />The Audio is very good. And the Video too. The only problem for me is WHY the Video is  not Anamorphic. I will never understand that.<br />The extras are terrific,  and I could write here more of 10.000 lines, about the extras because are  too much. Say that The Abyss Comes in 2 DVD. One for the movie. And the  other for the extras.<br />The menu is the best menu I see in any DVD, is 3D  interface made especially for the DVD. I think this menu is at the same  quality that the Menu of Alien and Aliens.<br />If You want a Good Movie and a  Good DVD. This is one of the best 5 DVD you can Buy.<br />Matrix. The Mummy.  Saving Private Ryan. Aliens.<br />Are The other Four. Until comes the Special  Edition of T2: Terminator 2. And the Star Wars.
0395645662|5.0|The Giver is five times better than I thouht it would be. Usually, school books are not very much fun to read. They try too hard to teach you something. Well, sinceI read the Giver, I've changed my mind; it was GREAT. It's the best school book I've ever read.     This great book is about a  boy named Jonas who lives in a utopian world. Jonas is the receiver of  memories in his community because no one else in the town has any memories.   He finds this out by seeing several memories of the real world. He finds  out that his world is just a colorless, emotionless pleace where no one has  any enjoyment using the senses. Jonas can't believe this! He is discouraged  ans appalled when he finds this out. He runs away looking for the real  world.   I loved this book because it has an excellent plot, and I  loved the ending because you make up the last part yourself. I thought the  ending was extremely suspenseful.  The setting of The Giver is in a  small village. The main charecters in The Giver are Jonas, the receiver of  the town; the Giver, the man who gives Jonas the memories; Asher, Jonas'  best friend; and Fiona, the girl whom Jonas likes. Th econflict in the book  is when Jonas realizes that his world is all the same and that people are  not given the choices to experience or feel and to be free and live in a  real world. Thsi makes Jonas feel differently about everybody in his life  and makes him want to run away. You will be surprised by the way he  resolves this conflict.  I thought the idea of having a person who  actually receives memories was intriguing. A utopia which takes away  personal freedom is not worth having! I highly recomend this book. It is  fun to read and it will make you think.
B00004SU5J|5.0|St germaine has always been a fav, but this CD tops the other two in terms of the construction of the pieces and the production.  Every track is  winner and it can be listened to countless times without losing that 'get  up and rock to it' vibe.  A very funky, jazz/soft dance CD.
0671578642|5.0|This book is an excellent piece of work, both from the perspective of character development and from the perspective of technical details. Weber develops highly enjoyable characters of considerable depth, but manages to  include enough data regarding technological considerations to actually  provide a plausible &quot;guesstimate&quot; of what future military  personnel may face as humanity goes out into space. He also includes some  interesting speculative sociology, as the star nation Honor Harrington is  trying to help are the descendents of extremely conservative fundamentalist  Christians, with some very outmoded and counterproductive ideas regarding  the &quot;proper place&quot; of women in society. One of the most  interesting themes in the book revolves around the mutual discomfort that  Harrington and her prospective allies feel toward each other, and how this  gradually evolves to respect. Do yourself a favor and read this book!
0440219078|5.0|The Giver by Los Lowry was a very clever way to say nothing can be perfect. The book is about Jonas, aboy who lives in a society where there are no choices, color, or feelings. Almost everything is done for them: their jobs are picked by a committee or elders, and their food is delivered  by dilvery men, but when Jonas is assigned to be the receiver of memory, a  job where you are given memories of love, he runs away to a community with  all the things he has been living with out.    I enjoyed the book a lot  because of its messafe: everything has a flaw. The book taught ne that  nothing can be perfect and that I don't want to be perfect. I enjoyed the  book to the very end because I enjoyed learning about Jonas' society. I  think the most interesting charecteristic of the novel was the ending. The  author left you to decide what was going to happen to Jonas. This ending  was unusual, so at first, I did not like it because I really wanted to  learn what happend to Jonas, but then, i realized what she was doing, and I  started to like the ending due to its peculiarity. That is why I am giving  it five stars.
B000008FNB|3.0|If you want a comprehensive box-set of the &quot;Rumours&quot; line-up (Fleetwood/McVie/McVie/Buckingham/Nicks) then you won't quite be pleased with this one.  It doesn't include &quot;Hold Me&quot; or &quot;Seven  Wonders&quot; or great album tracks like &quot;Honey Hi&quot; (the sweetest  li'l tune from Tusk, featuring round-robin harmonies with all 3 vocalists).   Also it would have been a chance to document one of Stevie's early live  performances of Rhiannon, which were wild... recent fans who saw &quot;The  Dance&quot; concert have no idea!<br />If you like the older pre-1975  material, chances are that one CD outta four is not going to satisfy you.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Get ready to laugh and laugh and laugh, remember what Eminem said about dont take the words seriously(Christiana Alga..(whatever), just enjoy the album, it is entertainment. Track 16 is sick BUT IT IS SWEET, FUNNY, AND  SHOWS EMINEM AS A GOOD STORY TELLER. Eminem mentions people who represent  Detroit but live far out in the Suburbs, keep it real. I live in Southfield  and thats why I put Metro Detroit on Where I am From.
014028902X|5.0|When the Durrell family decides to relocate to the Greek island of Corfu, they each have a decidedly different agenda. Oldest brother Leslie is off in search of his writing muse, brother Larry just wants to shoot guns, sister Margo is long suffering in love and Gerald cannot wait to explore. Told from the recollections of a ten year old this delightful tale is populated by these family members, headed by the benignly forgetful mother and faithful dog Roger, along with a series of characters from the island. Adding to this mix are animals collected by young Gerry, the narrator. Consumed with a love for all nature he adds an owl, water snakes, puppies, seagull, various insects, and the infamous magenpies to the mix. I cut my reading teeth on the Cheaper By the Dozen books and I think this measures up. After reading a description of the mating ritual of tortoises, as observed by a ten year old, I cannot look at one of the beast without laughing. This book is not only funny but suffused with a genuine affection for the people who inhabit it.
B000002HJD|5.0|This is a great Doors CD and so what if they added the music to Morrison's poetry after he died, the result was- in my opinion- one of the best Doors albums ever. It isn't as good as L.A. Woman but it's right up there... as a  matter of fact I think they're all pretty dang good. The thing however  which seperates this album from the others is the unadulterated,  uncensored, deep and moving lyrical content. On 'An American Prayer' Jim's  songs are more personal than ever and they give you a good message about  his perceptions of life and freedom.<br />Excerpt of &quot;Freedom  Exists&quot;<br />Did you know freedom exists in a school book, Did you know  madmen are running are prison, within a jail, within a gaol, within a white  free protestant maelstrom. We're perched headlong on the edge of boredom,  We're reaching for death on the end of a candle, We're trying for something  that's already found us.
0385493622|3.0|This book is a remarkable 350 year chronicle of Mathematic's search for The Solution to Fermat's Last Thereom. The story is rife with brilliance &amp; ego, fortitude &amp; arrogance. Fermat's Enigma is the rare find that  makes mathematics a joy to share with all. (Even the math-phobic.)<br />At one  point I literally wanted to throttle Fermat for his mind-boggling  cockiness, comfort Andrew Wiles for not quite getting it (and hug him when  he does finally get it) and to praise the universe for giving us Simon  Singh. He eloquently and visually describes what is often perceived as dry,  colorless and arcane.
0195073401|5.0|the critics of this book fail to mention the fact that if you are a graduate economics student you should be able to grasp the mathematics utilized in this book. <BR>the book may be dense and lacking explanatory power in terms of intuitive statements, but it certainly is the only graduate textbook which can be used as a stand-alone text for a complete micro sequence. kreps is too chatty and idiosyncratic and varian outdated. if someone criticises this book on the grounds of its mathematical sophistication he is basically criticising what modern micro amounts to (find this hard? good luck reading papers in econometrica). <BR>as noted by another reviewer the section on individual decision making is very good (the production chapter sucks, however). the same  can be said of the section on general equilibrium. the game theory chapters are simple, but still concise, likewise the two chapters on information economics. furthermore, there are three good chapters on welfare economics and incentives, topics not really treated in other micro texbooks. the exercises are a bit too \\"prove that this and that is convex\\"...
B00004T8RK|5.0|I absolutly tried my best to dislike this album. From the opening, to the typewriter sound ending, i thought, This could not be my favorite band. Then i listened to the album a second time. Despite its differences from  its predecessors,Binaural is wonderful. I am actually shocked at the  cohesiveness of the album because the increasing separation in song writing  credits. &quot;Light Years&quot; is simply haunting, and when listened in  context with the entire album, this makes me remember why i liked the band  in the first place. Other equally interesting and beautiful songs include  the wonderful &quot;In Thin Air&quot; and the dynamic  &quot;Insignificance&quot;. Gone is the pure grunge of the past, but this  Who/Zeppelin influenced work ranks as a Pearl jam masterpiece.
0140177396|5.0|I read this book because I somehow missed it in high school. At first I was unsure of the language, but it turned out to be a brilliant use of the vernacular. The things I keep thinking about are these: The attitude that  the men have toward animals is very similar to theirs toward women. These  are objects of function that can be replaced. The irony is that they  recognize themselves as dispensable animals of labor to the land owners,  and still regard animals and women and black people so poorly. This is an  ingenius illustration of the mechanisms of oppression.
B0000029DD|5.0|I WAS TURNED ONTO THIS ALBUM 3 MONTHS AGO AND I HAVEN'T TAKEN IT OUT OF MY CD PLAYER YET. I LIVE AND BREATH MUSIC, ALL KINDS, AND YET THIS CD JUST DOES SOMETHING TO ME EVERY TIME I LISTEN TO IT. I NEVER MET JB BUT I MISS  HIM DEEPLY.                   PURCHASE ASAP
0446310786|5.0|Being a 17 year old teenager I thought that Harper Lee's epicnovel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' would be rather boring.  Growing up inan era where science fiction rules every teenagers imagination, I was suprised to find that I enjoyed reading such a classic book. Harper Lee's narrator is young Scout Finch who is a fiesty, outgoing, self reliant young girl who witnesses the hate that the people of Maycomb have towards someone or something that is different from them. Witnessing the telling of the story in a childs eyes shows how innocent and not aware of prejudice children can be. Harper Lee has written a classic novel about hate, racism, class, love, and growing up. Who'da thought it would be that good!

1573225517|5.0|I loved this book.  It was assigned for a book club I am in, and I am glad.  I probably would not have bought this book on my own.  It is funny.  It is interesting.  And the writing flowed like conversation.  I recommend  this book highly, especially to you single women who want to know what men  are thinking.  Not much after all, unless it can be made into a list.   Quick, name your 5 all time best break ups!   Women can't do it without  thinking about it for a week, but apparently men can - instantly.  Because  that's how they converse, in list's....<br />Buy it, enjoy it, and commit it  to memory.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem's new cd, &quot;The Marshall Mather's LP&quot;, is by far the best rap CD of the year. A various assortment of different beats contributes to this being so succesful.  All in all, the skits are funny, the music is  incredible, and he is just one dope lyricist.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I BELIEVE IS LIKE HER SONG &quot;SHE DID IT AGAIN&quot; WITH THIS COOL CD AND THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THAT THE SONG &quot;SATISFACTION&quot; IS HORRIFIC THEY'RE LYING I THINK IS A GREAT SONG AND ALL THE OTHERS. AND I LIKE THAT  SHE TALKS IN THIS CD IS SO FUNNY AND COOL. IF YOU BUY THIS CD YOU WONT  REGRET IT.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The album is dope.  The beats are good, esp. the ones produced directly with Dr. Dre.  Eminem's lyrics are as hard, if not harder than the first.  If you're easily offened and you like Brittney Spears I suggest you start  listening to good music, and buy this alubm soon...Everyone else should buy  this now.
0312117337|5.0|My first ever set of Tarot cards and they are great.  I have since bought a more traditional deck.  The difference: the traditional deck indicates the future, this deck reflects inner states in the here and now. I use the  Osho deck everyday for the insight I get into myself.  I am learning Zen  from the cards.  Amazed a set of cards can do that. The art work is  beautiful.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album lives up to my high expectations and then some.  I listened to the entire album and I'm not sure if I can do anything else until I listen to it a few more times.  If you liked The Slim Shady LP, then you are  denying yourself a great album by passing this up. Also, Eminem totally got  back at the Insane Clown Posse with one of his tracks, I don't see how they  thought they could insult Eminem and get away with it!
0679746048|4.0|When I got this book I expected it to be dense and dramatic, but was pleasantly surprised to find it a light read. I breezed through it in practically no time - and Kaysen's writing makes it an enjoyable trip,  however short. My one complaint is that it seemed to go a little too fast.  We know plenty about Kaysen by the end of the book, but it is a little  tough piecing out everyone else. We know basic character traits: Lisa is  the proud sociopath, Daisy is obsessed with chicken and laxatives, etc. But  we don't get a deeper sense of who they are. The focus of the book is  obviously Kaysen herself, but it would be nice to know more about the  people she spent her time in the mental institution with. Also, changes in  Kaysen's life happen with too little explanation (suddenly she's free,  etc.), and time is a little out of order, so it gets confusing when in one  chapter someone leaves and in the next they're back in a conversation. But  I'm being picky - it is a very good book and those are its only faults. So  I do definitely reccomend it - especially if you are looking for a nice,  quick read.
B000002BFZ|5.0|No Code is Pearl Jam's best release - no questions asked.  It has  everything that makes Pearl Jam the unbelievably great group that they are.   Hard rocking tunes &quot;Hail Hail&quot;, &quot;Lukin&quot; and  &quot;Habit&quot;, the slow, Pink Floyd-esque anthems &quot;Off He  Goes&quot; and the type of song Pearl Jam do SO well, the mid tempo stuff  like &quot;Smile&quot;, &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; and &quot;Who You  Are&quot;.  Plus a real 70's retro rocker in &quot;Mankind&quot;.   &quot;Sometimes&quot; is a beautiful track highlighting Eddie's vocal  brilliance.  I say this is their best - but of course, I would still give  all of Pearl Jam's releases at least 4 and a half stars.  The quality of  their best work far surpasses anything I have ever had the privilege of  listening to.  And to all PJ fans, if you haven't bought Binaural - GET  IT!!!  It is second only to No Code...read my review!  God PJ are awesome!
6304044836|3.0|Julia Ormond had an impossible mission. She had to play a character made famous by Audrey Hepburn. She tried gamely enough but in the end fell miserably short. I really missed the sheer exhuberance that Miss Hepburn  brought to the movie. <br />The only thing that keeps this from falling into  the same grave as other remakes like &quot;Psycho&quot; is the wonderful  portrayal of Harrison Ford as Linus Larrabe. Ford does a great job in his  character, he is much more believable than Bogart.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This CD literally hasn't left my CD player since MAy 16 when it came out. There are quite a few great pop songs like oops, such as stronger, don't go knockin on my door, what U see is what U get, and can't make U love me.  Lucky is another personal fav, and as for the ballads, I like Don't let me  be the last to know and where are you now. AS you can see, I have almost  listed every song on the whole CD as my favorite song, but this CD is  really that good!
6300215717|5.0|There is no other way to describe this bittersweet Fairy Tale than Simply Elegant. Audrey Hepburn is magicalas the Princess who wants a break, and Gregory Peck is absolutely awesome as the Hard Boiled reporter who finds  himself falling for this precocious child who grows into a woman before his  eyes. Eddie Albert gets a wonderful supporting role as Peck's friend.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I am not the greatest fan of pop, and I'll admit that at fisrt I liked Britney more for her looks than for her music. This CD definitely changed my mind, it was fabulous, really.  I'm not just another tasteless pop fan,  but this album rocked.  My favs are What U See(is what U get), Can't Make  you love me, oops, and lucky. I could actually put down every song as one  of my favs, they are all that good. The material is much better than her  first, and I can tell she has matured. There are so many songs on this  album that could be smash-hit singles, it would still be producing hits in  a few years! Its just too bad that we won't be able to see the videos for  all of them. Thanks, i highly recommend this CD.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Im giving this disk a 4 out of 5 because the ranking 5 is just so easy to give to any CD that's okay.. The 5 rank is reserved for the best of the best.  The rank is my current opinon.<br />I think that this new Cd is  un-real.  Marshall is undoubtedly one of the hardest rappers today with the  lyrical content on this CD.  I have to commend Dre also with his  producing.. the beats on this disk are amazing.  <br />And remeber folks, I am  rating the &quot;CD&quot; and not the MP3's!   Peace, and much love to  ya'll
B00004SCX6|5.0|OK, here is what I think of each track.<br />Oops  I did it again-- a great song, pretty much a classic already. Not my favorite song, but a very catchy, dancable song 5/5<br />Stronger -- Lots of synthesizing, but A really  good tune that sends a good message.5/5<br />Don't go knocking on my door--  Another good pop song, the chorus is a little awkward at fist but I like it  better know.4/5<br />(I Can't get no)Satisfaction-- A change of pace in the  Cd, but has a good beat. 4/5<br />Don't Let me be the last to know--my  favorite ballad, great vocals 5/5<br />What U See is What U Get--my second  favorite song. Very danceable, like Oops.5/5<br />Lucky--A very personal song  for Britney, it has a great melody but is different from the typical pop  rhythms 5/5<br />One Kisss from you--Another good pop song, not my fav though  4/5<br />Where are you know-- excellent vocals, very powerful and emotional  5/5<br />Can't make you love me-- MY FAV, cool background noises and a very  catchy beat. I really hope this becomes a single.6/5<br />When your eyes say  it--Yes, a little corny, but a sweet ballad with very deep  lyrics.4/5<br />Dear Diary--I'm imoressed with Britney on this. Nothing that  stands out a lot, but a very sweet and personal song. 4/5<br />Much better  than her first album, &quot;Oops&quot; is pop at its finest! Take my word  for it
B00000K19E|5.0|A very entertaining movie, but I don't see why it was nominated for best picture. It was a little too &quot;summer blockbuster&quot; for my taste. Never the less, this is a great movie to add to your collection.
B000002P5W|5.0|This album really makes me wonder if Jimi Hendrix was sent here from another planet just for us to see what the perfect musician sounds like. On Axis bold as love The Jimi Hendrix Experience pushes the musical envelope  another step in the direction toward complete nirvana.  By now it is  obvious that Hendrix had mastered simple guitar playing, he could play it  so many in  different ways and always excellent. But on Axis he takes it a  step further. If you listen to the first track EXP. On first listen it  sounds like some sort of bizzare skit involving a space alien. But if you  listen to it closely, even close your eyes you realize that toward the end  that crazy sound that sounds like a ship taking off is actually Jimi on the  guitar making that sound. He is making the guitar sound like a space  ship!<br />Simply amazing!<br />And that's just the first track. Most of Axis..  sounds like an expriment. It seems as the JHE was experimenting with in the  studio with a multitude different musical styles and sounds. With most  artists experiments usually come with mixed results, but Jimi Hendrix was  not your average artists.  Hendrix expriments with soul  andf funk (so to  speak) on Up from the skies and Little miss lover. Hendrix already a master  at the blues pushes it a step further with the ultimate outsiders anthem if  6 was 9 (another good purchase is the Jimi hendrix blues CD). Then there's  the two slower tempo songs . The absolutely brilliant  balad Little wing  and the underrated one rainy wish (goldenrose). There's even a couple of  standard rock and rollish type of tunes; , wait til tomorrow, Ain't no  tellin, You got me floatin', done in usual hendrix fashion tongue and  cheek.  Throughout Axis.. the JHE keeps you enthralled and wondering really  if jimi hendrix was a space alien from another planet.  Anotehr planet  indeed.
0767849493|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  However, I did think it was a little too long at 130 minutes!  IT was very good though.  The elements of religion being twisted.  A very good movie, except for die hard rollie rollers, they  might wanna stay away...REmember...its only a movie....fantastic
B00000J7S8|3.0|This is one of the CDs where each song is wonderful all by itself, but put the CD together and it's boring. Each song is finely crafted, but there's not enough variation in pace to put the listener in a slash-your-wrists  mood. The only song that even tries to liven the CD up is &quot;I Can't  Give You Anything But Love.&quot; Overall, this CD is one of those CDs that  you pull out to listen to a song or two but you promptly take it off as  soon as you're through.
B000002C1X|5.0|This was the first Pink Floyd album I had heard,  and it made me listen to such other masterpieces such as Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Division Bell and Obscured By Clouds. My favourite is &quot;The  Happiest Days Of Our Lives&quot; and I used to walk around my school with a  boombox and listened to it. It drove the teachers batty, but what else can  I say except &quot;Hey, teacher! Leave them kids alone!&quot;
B00000AFHM|4.0|Some of the songs on this CD (Brilliant Career, Sleep The Clock Around, Dirty Dream #2, The Boy With The Arab Strap) are among the most instantly catchy and yet lasting songs this side of 1990.  In my opinion, these  represent the strongest work of an extremely clever group, and for these  alone, I must highly recommend this CD.<br />Throw into this some strong,  though less compelling tracks, and a couple more which are unfortunately, a  little sluggish.<br />Though a less consistent work than their  &quot;Sinister&quot; or even &quot;Tigermilk&quot;, the moments of  brilliance on this disc can literally give me goosebumps.  And that doesn't  happen too often, anymore.
6305313687|5.0|This movie was a provocative look at what the life of an idolistic, racist man would be like after he realizes the wrong of his ways. This movie has breathtaking preformances by Norton and Furlong alike. This is one of my  personal all time favourites and would recommend it to anyone in a second.  The sheer power that it delivers in every scene depicting the hatred and  conflagrations that still take place to this day in places is mesmorizing.  Nothing else can compare to this beautifully filmed masterpiece. A great  add to anyone's collection!
B00004STPT|5.0|I couldn't wait to receive my cd from Amazon.com.  Finally it came and I have been enraptured ever since.  It really evokes the feelings of the movie; clear images come to mind as I listen.  Some songs even make me cry,  they are so beautiful.  I particularly love 'To Zucchabar', 'Honor Him' and  'Now We Are Free'.  A must have for anyone who enjoyed the movie or enjoyes  movie soundtracks and emotional music.
1573226521|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read! The character development was fantastic, and the plot never sagged.  It continuously built intrigue and suspense.  I haven't seen the movie, yet, however, I am excited to get  the visuals for this great story.  Definitely check it out-- Alex Garland's  first effort was definitely top grade!
B00003CWQ2|5.0|Fight Club has to be one of the best films I have seen in years. A complex, well acted, beautifully flimed drama about one man's descent into madness, it is alive with dark humor, violent action, emotional turmoil,  skillful plotting and really insightful commentary on social life and  society at century's end.<br />Ed Norton and Brad Pitt are exceptional. As  different as night and day, it isn't possible to compare their  performances, but since they exist in the film as foils for one another's  characters they create together a wonderful balance - an edgy give and take  that is at the heart of the film's exciting dynamic. Helena Bonham Carter,  free for once of the aristocratic pretensions of her usual film characters,  can't begin to measure up. She doesn't have the heat on screen that Norton  and Pitt bring to their parts. Meat Loaf, in a surprisingly touching  characterization, brings more to the screen - in every sense - than Carter  does.<br />It isn't fair to try and elaborate on the plot because the twists  and ambiguities are a large part of the fun - and of the darker purpose of  the film. But it is worthwhile to point out what the film is not; it is not  a typical &quot;guy&quot; film. It uses the boy-centered, testosterone  fueled theme of the 'fight club', a club that exists strictly for the  purpose of providing guys an opportunity to fight, to make a valid critical  statement about urban societ today - men feel isolated, adrift, untested,  worthless and tame. Fight club gives its members confidence, provides a  chance for them to express their anger and aggression, creates contact and  bonding, fills the emptiness and gives them purpose. Watching the fight  club go from an informal gathering for a few to a rule based movement  spreading like wildfire across the country is almost surreal.<br />There is  lots of savage humor in this film. Many of Pitt's lines and a lot of  Norton's voice-over narration are both memorable and funny. But this is  definitly not a comedy and not for the faint of heart. If you've got the  stomach for it, this is one great entertainment and a fine serious film at  the same time. I highly recommend it.ly not a comedy and not for the faint of heart. If you've got the  stomach for it, this is one great entertainment and a fine serious film at  the same time. I highly recommend it.
6304398395|4.0|Though a great deal had already been written all about the world's most famous and talented comedy actor, here is a film to present his history in every frank detail for the very first time. After the opening credits where  the handsome young Robert Downey Jr. sensuously wiped his chalk-white  Chaplin makeup right off, the celebrated tramp's autobiography begins at  his childhood when the little moppet with tousled hair raced gleefully  right through the theater where his mentally unstable mother used to sing.  Then we are taken though the turn-of-the-century vaudeville days where Mr.  Chaplin first fell into love with a beautiful young girl and the  behind-the-scenes shots at the Keystone studios where he got his very first  break as The Tramp. Here we personally witness the steamy love scenes and  the scorching sandals and trials with several young ladies in Chaplin's  life. Then the poor long-suffering old man finally found his true love who  would continue to remain with him for the rest of his life and thus produce  many beautiful children with him, including the lovely Geraldine Chaplin  who would play the actor's mother in this movie. But the aging celebrity's  peace would be quite short-lived, for he would be so suddenly exiled from  the very country he himself had adopted and entertained for several  decades. But in the very end, the old Charlie Chaplin would return in great  glory to be lionized for his filmmaking deeds and his tremendous  contribution to the relatively short history of cinematography. A very bold  and insightful study of a much acclaimed actor yet a very sad and  frustrated man in his private life.
078322608X|5.0|I honestly still haven't completely figured this movie out. It is a very strange and twisted story. Although it may be wierd, it is still a very entertaining movie. The casting for this movie was perfect, and the actors  do a great job. You gotta see it.
B00004T9UF|4.0|If this CD was made by HBO films, it would definitely qualify as a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot;!  Lyrically, Eminem is brutally honest and holds no punches - dissing everybody from Will Smith, Britney Spears,  President Clinton, Christine Aguilera, Christopher Reeves...and so on.   This boy has some serious issues!  With 18 tracks deep of punchlines and  hooks that hurt, you'll get your money's worth.<br />Standout cuts  are:<br />&quot;Marshall Mathers&quot; - In his sick-but-honest manner, Em  addresses issues that affect him personally like phony family members,  Tupac and Biggie's death, and boy bands.<br />&quot;Stan&quot; - This track  displays his true writing talent.  In jarring detail, Em displays the  thoughts of a troubled fan desparate for his attention.<br />&quot;Who  Knew&quot; - This is aimed directly at parents who blame all the troubles  they have with their children on Em and others in the entertainment  industry.  Definitely worth the listen for those with  teens.<br />&quot;Kim&quot; - Not for those raised in an abusive household.   Brutal, in-depth view of a jealous husband/lover with a motive to be  &quot;rid&quot; of his girl.<br />&quot;Criminal&quot; - Twisted and funny  (especially the robbery scene). Eminem displays his many personalities with  tight lyrics.<br />Helping to hold this album down are his boys D-12 (Dirty  Dozen) from his hometown Detroit.  They represent on the demented  &quot;Amityville&quot; track and on &quot;Under The  Influence&quot;.<br />Compared to his debut album, this album is a lot darker.   Please remember folks, this is just entertainment.  Relax and  enjoy.<br />-Kenetic Monk
6304806434|4.0|This is a very good action flick. The story could use a little work, but I really can't complain. A lot of the action done with the plane was amazing. There are plenty of large explosions and destruction to wet the appetite,  many of which are quite funny. Particulary the scene where a mint Corvette  is flying through the air.
B00004T8RK|2.0|Ever since around Vitalogy, when the bickering with the media and with it's popularity started to mount, Pearl Jam has been on a crusade to get out of the spotlight. All of this is fine on the artistic level. The  trouble is that in trying to lose fans (and let's face it; the only way to  become less popular is to turn large numbers of fans off) the band has been  sacraficing the music as well.<br />By the time Pearl Jam's public distaste  for fame peaked, and the tension between the band and fans was becoming  public gossip, it became apparent that Pearl Jam was following the  problematic blueprint of Alan Alda. They have a lot in common. Both were  unexpectedly very, very popular. And both were essentially nice people who  did not want to be liked as much as they were. So both have gone out of  their way to wipe out their image and therefore their popularity, to the  point that they intentionally avoid their strengths. Alan Alda was so  obsessed with ending his nice-guy image that he deliberately took lots of  roles as bad guys, no matter how awful the movie was. Pearl Jam has avoided  playing to its strengths because they fear that to put out a great album  would mean that they'd be hugely famous all over again.<br />Most of the  reviews seems to assume that the band is either on top of its game or  fading. I view it differently. I believe that the band is holding back, and  has been since Vitalogy. Sure, they have had some great moments. But they  also have put out lots of songs that are either very mediocre or just plain  silly. It's hard not to view this as deliberate, given the opinions brought  forth by Vedder in interviews.<br />As for the album itself, it has a  frustrating blandness to it. Remember when the conventional wisdom was that  Stone Temple Pilots were Pearl Jam wannabees? Now Pearl Jam sounds like  they're trying to figure out the STP formula.<br />And unlike past efforts,  Binaural is very bottom- heavy in terms of where the strongest songs are.  In fact, aside from the possible exception of &quot;Nothing As It  Seems,&quot; nothing noteworthy happens until &quot;Rival&quot;, the tenth  song. &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; and &quot;Parting Ways&quot;, which  comprise of two of the final three songs on the album, are the strongest.  But even these songs pale bfore past efforts. <br />And the thing that baffles  me is that if this band really wants to branch out into noncommercial  music, why not take more musical risks? Despite reviews that have stated  that Binaural marks their abandonment of grunge, it certainly sounds very  similiar to it. <br />The problems start immediately, with Breakerfall.  Amazingly, the band seems to be hung up on starting every single album  (except No Code) with a short, catchy riff song. Breakerfall fits the mold,  and it doesn't even stand up to Brain of J. It sounds hollow and forced.  <br />A good indication of where the trouble lies is found in the credits.  Generally the albums where Vedder dominates have been the weakest. When  McCready asserts himself and gets more songwriting in, it's almost always  for the better. This album shows McCready to be almost completely absent.  It's the Ament and Vedder show, and it doesn't work (even though I will  concede Vedder's part in writing the strongest songs).<br />I don't think that  Pearl Jam is washed up. I still think they have a great album in them.  They've put out some very, very good albums, but they've never put out an  album where every song was a success. Hopefully the window of opportunity  isn't closing on them for them to get their act together and make that  great album.
6302759110|2.0|I really don't know where to start in my review for this film. All I know for sure is that I was truly disappointed with this film. I was expecting something great from this movie. I mean after all it was directed by  Francis Ford Coppla. There are two things that really bother me about this  film. First is the acting. I'm sorry people but the acting was bearly  decent. Why was Keanu Reeves put in this film? Can anyone answer that  question? What happened! Did Coppola have ear plugs on when Reeves  auditioned. It's amazing actually just how bad he is in this film. And Sir  Anthony Hopkins? How can a man of his stature deliver such a horrible  performance. But this leads into my second problem with this film. Now I  know that this is suppose to be very close if not exactly to what was  written by Bram Stoker,but to be honest,I DON'T CARE! I honestly don't care  how well the transition is from novel to screenplay. It was simply bad.  That could be the reason why the acting was so bad. I mean the actor can  only do so much with what they are given. If a scrpit is bad,it's bad. The  actor or actress can't do to much to save it.The movie just seemed to go on  and on. I couldn't take it. The only person who I enjoyed watching was  Winona Ryder. I think she was the best thing to come out of this film  besides Coppola's fine directing. As for the effects? Well I must admit  they really didn't shock me. They were mediocre at best. What I did like  though was the production design's as well as the costume design's. So all  in all the film to me had more bad points then good points which were  Winona Ryder,Coppola's directing,and the production and costume designs. So  to be fair this film really deserves ** 1\2 out of *****. ONLY watch it if  your a die hard Dracula fan!
0790731983|5.0|In 1972 it would have been next to impossible to make a conventional, MGM-type musical and get away with it. The form was largely passe by the end of the 60s--the last glorious gasp may have been &quot;The Sound of  Music&quot;--but by the late 60s attempts to film more conventional  musicals (remember Finian's Rainbow?) flopped  mightily.<br />&quot;Cabaret&quot; seemed to point the way toward a new  musical.  Gritty, sharp, sophisticated--you've heard all the adjectives.   The praise was warranted too.  What wasn't so obvious, though, was that it  too was something of a last gasp.  &quot;Cabaret's&quot; verisimilitude so  praised by many did not really lend itself that well to other settings.   Decadent Berlin in the 30s holds a fascination for us all, the celebration  before the devastation.  And there really was a cabaret culture there until  the Nazis finally cracked down on all free expression.  Perfect fodder for  a nouveau-musical.<br />And rife with cinematic qualities too.   &quot;Cabaret&quot; is a masterfully filmed work.  As so many others have  noted, everything just works perfectly in this film.  Ultimately, you even  forget the fact that Liza Minelli's Sally really is too big a talent for  this dive. You accept her fantasy of being discovered by Hollywood or by  UFA while working in this fleabag. Hey, it could happen...<br />So why wasn't  there ever a &quot;Cabaret 2&quot;?  Why didn't Fosse, Minelli or Joel Grey  ever equal or surpass their work here?  Well, there were other musicals  which placed their musical numbers in a true-to-life context (musicals  about musicians). But films about rock stars (Barbra's &quot;Star Is  Born&quot; or &quot;The Rose&quot;) just didn't have the same pizzazz.  We  already knew the milieu; not too much to romanticize about rock star  junkies OD'ing.<br />But for one brief shining moment, there was ...pre-war  Berlin.
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic is a great album. Instaed of just  rapping over beats, Nas did what he always has done and flowed complex lyrics that are as smooth and sweet as butter on a biscut. Nas doesn't drop any true mental or spiritual  knowledge on here (he was only 20) but he constructs his raps so well, and  delivers them so perfectly that it sometimes doesn't matter. I know  everyone loves the World Is Mine and NY state of Mind, but for perfection  cheak Memory Lane, Represent and It Ain't Hard To Tell. These are the  perfect marriage between beat, lyrics, and flow. It anyone can find  anything more perfect thatn this, please e-mail me of your monumental  discovery. Now as far as this being the best hip-hop album of all time,  it's up there, but its not the greatest. Cheak Things Fall Apart (the  Roots) for that.
B00004T0P1|5.0|When I saw the preview for the movie I was spellbound. I wished they had released a single of just the preview soundtrack! <br />This soundtrack will not dissapoint you...the movie isn't too bad either. Though, I must confess  there were times when I closed my eyes during the movie, so as not to  detract from the music!
0679720200|5.0|For me, The Stranger, is one of those books of which I have heard and read much about, but which I have never actually read from cover to cover.  The fact that the book now appears in an &quot;American&quot; translation  encouraged me to finally pick up the book and read it.  From its famous  first sentence through Meursault's final musings as he awaits execution, I  was totally entranced.  Several times I castigated myself for not reading  this book sooner, because I think that it is an important statement that is  as relevant now as it was when it was first published.<br />Meursault goes  through life dispassionately, seeing the choices of his life as being of no  importance, and never concerning himself with social conventions.  He has  only one credo: to be honest to himself and to others.  Ironically, this  normally admirable quality often offends those around him and brands him as  being immoral.  Therefore, the fact that he does not cry at his mother's  funeral is seen by his prosecutors as being just as criminal as the  pointless murder Meursault commits &quot;because of the sun.&quot;  While  most existential literature is cyncial and pessimistic, The Stranger offers  readers a semblance of hope in facing the &quot;benign indifference of the  universe.&quot;  Meursault realizes at the end of his life that he has been  happy and that his death, just as his mother's, will not be greeted with  tears.
630575067X|1.0|Yeah, I wathed this movie and was definitely disappointed.   First of all i don't see how people could go so CRAZY over Darth Maul, he was such a big thing to everybody yet he was in the movie like 5 times or something, and a  total of like 10 min. Maybe he did and maybe he didn't, but I don't even  remember him talkig! So it dosn't make sense to me to go so wild over that  wierd person.   I also did not like Anikan Skywalker. He just had bad  acting. He also had a bad scrip too, but mostly it was the acting. The  character just wasn't realistic, he didn't act like a real 8 or 9 year old  boy.  Well, in my opinion don't waste you're money renting this movie, get  something good like the real Star Wars for instance.
0060196122|1.0|When I heard of this story I was intrigued as to what Paulo Coelho had to say about a girl who attempted a failed suicide but knew she would still die within five days.  The lessons learned here could be quite insightful  and incredibly touching, especially since her fate has been pre-determined  by her actions.  Unfortunately, I found the author's use of the third  person at the beginning of the novel to be rather pretentious, and the  ending to be especially cliche.  If Coelho hadn't put a twist on the plot,  the ending would have had better closure and meaning. Instead, it became  another hackneyed story about a girl committing a plea suicide, something  much too familiar and far less memorable.
B000007U6W|5.0|Kraftwerk's 1974 &quot;Autobahn&quot; is still an amazing recording, over 25 years after its original release.  These four guys really did pioneer the whole electronic pop genre way back in 1974 - though most are unaware  of this.<br />I purchased the original LP back when it was released, and  played it until I practically wore out the grooves.  Very hypnotic,  trance-like, and inventive - the title track, at over 22 minutes (and  taking up the entire first side of the original LP) is a masterpiece of  electronic impressionistic music.  And unlike so much of today's  &quot;techno&quot;, it is melodic and emotionally soothing, rather than  bone-jarring.<br />The rest of the CD is also artistically inventive and  interesting - but still pleasant to listen to, especially  &quot;Kometenmelodie 2&quot;.  Highly recommended classic recording.
B0000027I6|5.0|Much better than the two previous Roger Waters albums - 'The Pros and Cons of Hitch-hiking' was very dull and 'Radio KAOS' extremely silly - 'Amused to Death' features Roger Waters' gravelly, wasted voice leering  well-written lyrics about the madness of war into our heads. It's a bit  like 'The Final Cut', the last Roger Waters Pink Floyd album, in that the  topic is mostly anti-war, with a tiny bit of Andrew Lloyd-Webber for good  measure. The difference here is that the war is the Gulf War, not the  Falklands.<br />Musically, it's extremely well-produced, and well-played but  (as you might expect) long-winded. Although the David Gilmour incarnation  of Pink Floyd are generally quite uninteresting, the lack of distinctive  tunes works against 'AtD' - at times it seems as if the music is  subservient to the lyrics. Still, it's almost operatic in places ('What God  Wants' for example, with the obligatory Roger Waters People's Choir). At  other times you'll want to telephone Waters and ask him to gargle some  mouthwash and rest himself, as his voice seems to have been shredded since  'Radio KAOS'.<br />It's still a wonderful album, though.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I have been a devoted Peal Jam fan for almost 10 years.  I have stood behind Pearl Jam, despite the widespread opinion that they have sold out, and they still remain one of my all time favorite bands.  I have seen Pearl  Jam live, and in my opinion, they are only second to the Ramones.  When  first hearing Binaural, I was greatly  intrigued.  It seems as if they just  keep evolving as a band. I was instantly hooked on the songs  &quot;Breakerfall&quot;,&quot;Light Years&quot;, &quot;Nothing as it  Seems&quot;, &quot;Thin Air&quot;, &quot;Insignificance&quot;,  &quot;Rival&quot; and &quot;Soon Forget&quot;.  The other songs are  amazing, as well.  Eddie Vedder did a great job with the lyrics he wrote,  his voice was wonderful, as usual, and I have to say I really enjoyed his  ukulele playing in &quot;Soon Forget&quot;.  Stone did a great job on the  lyrics he wrote, as did Jeff Ament and Mike McCready is always fabulous.  I  would not recommend this cd to those who only like the Ten cd.  This is a  very different sound and it will probably only be truly appreciated by the  die hard Pearl Jam fans.  In my opinion, Pearl Jam just keeps getting  better and better and Binaural is a prime example of that.  It's true Pearl  Jam.  I was happy not to find any of the types of songs that are written  just to be fan favorites, such as &quot;Nothingman&quot;, &quot;Elderly  Woman&quot;, &quot;Betterman&quot;, &quot;Daughter&quot;, etc.  So, if you  are a Pearl Jam addict, such as myself, this is a must buy.  Also, if you  have not seen Pearl Jam live yet, by all means see their Binaural tour!
B000002UC5|5.0|This album is so comforting.  I don't know what's up with people who rate this album with 3 stars.  The instrumentals are very good.  The bass lines was very melodical.  Very well played instruments.  What struck me about  this album what how it's feel and sound was very different than the  Beatles.  Do this: plug in the white album.  And listen..... can't you feel  the tension and the pain that is expressed through the music.  And Abbey  Road....you can still feel it.  John's yokoish lyrics and music.  McCartney  is beatiful.  It is so laid back, but not to laid back to filter out the  quality of his music.  Buy this album.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Tim Burton has created a spectacular horror/mystery with Sleepy Hollow.  Throw in a bit of comedy, and you have a magnificent movie.  I'm a anything but a Johnny Depp fan, but I must admit, he played the roll of Ichabod  Crane flawlessly.  Christina Ricci was also excellent, as was the  supporting cast.<br />A must see for any horror fan old enough for the graphic  violence, as this movie is by far, no children's story.
B000000WA4|5.0|This CD is really nice.  IT has a ton of songs because it has 2 CD's and their all good.  With songs like &quot;1979&quot; and &quot;Lily(My one and only)&quot; it mite be their best CD.  Their other CD&quot;Machina the  Machines of God&quot; I think would be the only other one that comes close.   I would recommend buying this CD befor any other.
6303148352|3.0|Spielberg creates some genuinely terrifying momnents in this popcorn thriller about dinosaurs brought back to life and running amok on an island. The film is well-paced for tension, and includes a few moments of  deadpan humor like the &quot;objects in mirror are closer than they  appear&quot; sign on a car mirror when a T. Rex is closing in from behind.  This movie is probably too scary for children. As with many Crichton plots,  this one is kind of ridiculous if you give it any thought, but it's fun if  you like monster movies.
B00004T9UF|3.0|This new hit by slim shady is o.k., but I think it lacked the beats of his previous album.  The marshal mathers lp is not even close to his original album.  If your going to get a cd by slim shady why not stick to the first  one.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Marshall Mathers LP is a great album, like the first one the first released track is not the only good song on it.
B000000OUE|5.0|This is the best album ever! I HIGHLY recomend that you buy this album! At times, it has good heavy rock like the song, Super Charger Heaven. Techno sounds like, More Human than Human. Finally, stuff that is more mellow like  Blood Milk and Sky and Grease Paint and Monkey Brains. Has a bit of  everything. Absolute best Zombie album to date! My fav is I, Zombie. If you  don't like the lyrics, buy the edited version! A must have! This music is  too interesting to not hear!
B00003CXDU|5.0|With all the Christmas time movies which came out with Galaxy Quest, we almost over looked it. Good thing we didn't. The first time I saw it I couldn't stop laughing from a little ways in on! With the childish humor of  Larado(sp?) to the quick wit of Doctor Lazarus, this movie delivers it all.  The movie is such a spoof of Star Tre!. From the conventions with people  dressed like the characters right down the the blue drink(Romulin Ale in  Star Trek) Star Trek is written all over it. When a bunch of has-been  actors/actress are contacted by real aliens they don't know what they're  getting in to. They end up in space fight bad guys, steering through  astroid fields, and  stoping the distruction sequence. We eventually saw  this three times in the theater and now own it on video. There is only one  place the Lord's name is taken and through the rest of the movie there is  only moderate bad language. The only really objctionalble thing is at the  end Lt. Madison's suit gets torn at the top exposing her bra. This is mild  and is only that way for 5 minutes. Other than that, a definite buy!
B0000013G9|5.0|I have had this album every since I was 11 years old and I love the hell out of it. Every song is capable of being no.1 on the charts. This is my favorite album of all time. Most albums you have to skip some boring songs  but on this album you have to go back and relisten to a song. My favorite  song on the album is &quot;Sumthin Wicked This  Way Comes&quot; this song  is about how people judge you they don't even know you. The lyrics are so  strong and touching. The songs on this album are not at all elementry like  some other artist who are singing about &quot;I love you, do you love me  mark yes are no&quot; this is the best album ever it gives Micheal   Jackson's Thriller a run for it's money. I love this album you need to buy  it if you want an album that gives you an understading on how life is.
B0000028UK|4.0|Vs. is a great album, and I am not saying that I don't like it, but in my opinion, Vitalogy is slightly better. It is so expiramental and there is such a strong variation there that it enraptures the listener with  pleasure. It is therapy for your ears... but anyway, back to Vs.<br />Vs. is  very, very good and is Pearl Jam's third best album after Ten and Vitalogy.  Songs like Go, Daughter and Blood set the tone for basically every type of  song on the album - and then there are ridiculous songs like Rats  [equivalent of 'bugs' on Vitalogy] that just make you laugh. Vs. has great  songs and bad songs all mixed in with each other. It is hard to listen to  the entire album, bu the songs that are pleasurable and catchy and will  always keep your finger on the repeat button; however, regardless of the  strong competition b/w Pearl Jams albums, Vs. is a very strong contender  for being in their top three. If you are a Pearl Jam fan or just curious  about the band, you may want to invest in Vs. It will not disappoint. Ten  is also very good and is very accessible, but wait to get Vitalogy. It's a  difficult, but VERY rewarding listen.<br />Rating: B+
B00004T9UF|4.0|I recommend this cd to those who liked the first, but not to those who didn't dig him the first time around and we waiting for a second swing at bat. Where the first album felt disjointed, this one it totally cohesive  and the production, rhyme schemes and sensiblity are just mah-velous. A  couple of songs are very Psycho (Kim comes to mind) but Eminem fans would  love it.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The is Marshal Mathers' (Eminem's) best album yet. Dispite the explicit lyrics and sick humer it is halriously funny. He has picked good backround music and good sound effects. He has realated all his songs to his life  wich is interesting because you learn about his life. Slim Shady's life has  been very similer to Eminiem's. I like the way he targets pop. He totally  dises pop and I personly hate pop. I hope you really like this CD because I  do.
6305127638|4.0|Jonathan Frakes did an admirable job with this movie, but I think he did better with Insurrection.  First Contact, while very good in its own way, lacked the punch that the other Star Trek movies had.  And the black lady  just gets on my nerves!  She wasn't well cast.  But, aside from that, the  action is good, the visuals are very nice, and the screenplay is well put  together.  A worthy addition to any Star Trek fans library.
B000000OTY|5.0|I'm sorry for the woman who got converted from country music by this album, because there ain't nothing in the world wrong with Travis Tritt and Reba McIntyre, but if this album brought her to the other side of the  fence, it was the right one.  I'm probably not the only person in the world  who really discovered Peter Gabriel when MTV played the  &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; video about 500 times a day for about six months,  but once I started exploring I was hooked.  I envy the people in Italy (of  all places) who saw this show -- I agree with the previous reviewer about  the magnificence of &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, and I would add &quot;Don't  Give Up&quot; to the jubilation -- I suppose Kate Bush can't travel with  Peter Gabriel, and I sort of missed her ethereal voice on the song, but the  female backup did just fine, too.  The bottom line is that Peter Gabriel is  one of the true greats of 20th century music, and this live album showcases  him at his very, very best.
6304539258|5.0|We are all in debt to George Lucas for giving us this wonderful movie!  This movie is such a big part of our culture and has influenced so much, it's unreal!  A New Hope is great in its Classic form or Special Edition!   Combining a wonderful cast, great special effects, and a powerful score by  John Williams, Star Wars: A New Hope will be a movie for all ages for  decades to come!
B00004T8RK|4.0|I have read alot of negative reviews for this LP of late and would just like to say that if you are a true fan of the band you will enjoy it.The biggest knock on Binaural seems to be that it is too slow and that there  are not enough potential hit singles.     While yes there are more slower  moodier songs on this disk, rockers such as Evacuation, Greivence and God's  dice are all classic Pearl Jam.  While the more mid tempo Thin Air, and  Light years(my current favorite) should be enough for those looking for  another Betterman or Daughter.     Overall I would say that this is the  least experimantal Pearl Jam recording since Vs, with only the Ukelele  ballad Soon forget, straying from the Pearl Jam norm.    So don't let the  reviews get you down, if you are a Pearl Jam fan, who have enjoyed their  previous efforts, go pick Binaural up. You won't be disappointed.
B00000K3D4|2.0|Everything else about this movie is just bad.  David Bowie was a horrible choice to play the bad guy!  He can't sing worth beans!  His voice sounds like a frog with a flu!  And the choice of the actor for the main girl was  less than admirable.  She did a sub-par job.  The sets in this movie had a  great fantasy look, and the puppeteering was fabulous!  But everything  else, including a rather sappy screenplay, detracts from it and leaves it  in the dust.  Kids will enjoy it, but I'll never waste my time watching it  again.
B00004STPT|5.0|Hey, I missed Dead Can Dance! This album showcases Lisa's breathy ,almost heartbreakingly brilliant voice in all of it's rich amber tonalities. If this is the very first time that you have heard of Lisa Gerrard you owe it  to yourself to track down a copy of The Serpent and the Egg by Dead Can  Dance which sounds incredibly like this album.
B00000ILBK|5.0|I must say that while First Contact was good, I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I did Insurrection.  There is plenty of action to keep you glued to the screen, and the visual effects are very, very good!  The story, while  not terrific, works well, and the screenplay was very well executed by the  cast!  This is a great addition to anyone's sci-fi film library!  Whether  you're a Star Trek fan or not, you'll really enjoy Insurrection!
B00004SCX6|2.0|Britney spears' album sounds almost like a replica of ...Baby one more time!  and what's with all the weird talking in all of her songs!
B00000K19E|5.0|The Wachowski brothers really cooked up one monster of a movie with The Matrix.  It's got everything a good sci-fi movie needs:  Deep story, fabulous visual effects, a powerful score, and a wonderful cast!  This is a  movie I'll enjoy for many years to come, and certainly one of the most  entertaining, and most well put-together sci-fi flicks of all time!
B0000024K1|5.0|What more can you say about it?  I got the cassette tape when it first came out in 1988.  No other rap album has been able to surpass it.  &quot;Message&quot; music seems to have become less popular over the years,  but the message behind this cannot be denied.  The struggle of the African  Americans in this country and the stigma often attached is just as evident  today as it has ever been.  One might even suggest that Chuck D and the  rest of Public Ememy were ahead of their time, especially when talking  about police brutality and drug use amongst African Americans.  My favorite  cut is still Night of the Living Baseheads.  They combine a little bit of  humour with social awareness and racial awareness.  Yes, they have  meaningful lyrics, but no one can compare to the Terminator X's cuts.  The  music is off the hook.  This is a CD that will have you partying while you  feed your mind with knowledge.  Party with a purpose!
630575067X|5.0|Lucas has cooked up yet another masterpiece with Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.  This wonderful prelude to Episode II introduces us to the character of Anakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader.  Some find him  annoying, but he acts just like any 9-year old would!  Excited, ambitious,  and out-going.  Jar Jar, while a bit irritating at times, was a welcome  addition, and casting Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn was the best casting  decision in the whole movie!  Neeson plays his parts flawlessly and gives  us one more reason why he's one of the best actors of all time.  Any Star  Wars fan will greatly enjoy Phantom Menace!  This is a film I will remember  and be proud to own for many years to come!  I eagerly await TPM's launch  on DVD!  George Lucas knew exactly what he was doing with this movie, and  he ended up with a timeless classic!
B00004T9UH|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST CD EVER! THE BEST TRACKS ON THIS CD ARE STAN AND THE REAL SLIM SHADY. WHY ARE U SITTING HERE READING THIS GO OUT AND BUY IT! HURRY! ONCE AGAIN BEST CD EVER!
B0000048V8|5.0|we loaned our &quot;snowman&quot; video to a friend and can't remember who it was, so we are purchasing another one!  apparently, whomever we loaned it to loves it just as much! my children, 4 and 7, will watch this movie  over and over and over.  My 4 year old, who has never had a piano lesson,  has been desperate to figure out how to play the &quot;snowman&quot; music  on our electronic keyboard.  I could just listen to the music forever.   Just found out it's on CD, so I'm going to look for it. I keep reading  about Jewish people reviewing the movie and saying it doesn't matter to  them that it's a Christmas video.  I am Jewish too, and it never even  occurred to me that it was a Christmas movie until I read these reviews!  The most beautiful children's video available.
0451169514|4.0|A worthy investment of time and imagination, and that's just on the reader's part. King may not receive any accolades for his genius in this lifetime, but he certainly should for this book alone, where the reader is  extracted from reality to live the nightmares of children, so that we  remember our kid fears even as adults.
0684872153|5.0|Brilliant. The book consists of Irish racisim (&quot;no one in the family spoke to Tom's wife because she was from Galway and had the look of the Spaniard about her&quot;), alcholism (&quot;the curse of the Irish&quot;),  poverty and a childs innocence. Mixed together you have a book that  conjures all sorts of emotions as you read, from anger to joy.<br />As I was  reading the book, I found myself thinking back on all the stories my ma use  to tell me about her growing up in Dublin. How she never had two pennies to  rub together, how they were poor and she had to go out and work at an early  age. I use to dismiss these stories and her comments about how lucky we are  these days, but now I find that I am more appreciative of what I  have.<br />Buy this book, read it, believe it. It's one to keep.
6305750750|3.0|This movie is not as bad as everyone says.  Unfortunately it is a victim of its own hype.  Truth is, if this movie didn't have the title &quot;Star Wars,&quot; all those fanatics out there (who spend 40 days in line to see  it, with no life) wouldn't have hated it as much.  People were expecting  too much.<br />They were right about a few things, however.  The movie does  not have the emotional impact that episodes 4,5, and 6 had.  And the  special effects were way too dense, Lucas needed to calm down with those.  And yes, Jar Jar hurt the movie.<br />Overall a welcome addition to the  series, and not as bad as some fanatics say.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I am not really a fan of Britney Spears but I did purchase the album as a gift for a friend. I must say when I heard it I was very impressed. It is definately more mature then her last alblum. Also I think it showcases her  unique singing voice very well. Two or three of the songs will still send  you into sugar shock but she's only 18 and her musical style will grow as  she does. I  think the songs Oops..I did it again, Stronger, and What you  see (Is what you get) are the best. They do well to answer her critics and  show her new found maturity. Also her remake of the Rolling Stones song  Satisfaction is excellent.
6305627347|5.0|If you love sick comedy, then you'll love this movie.  it has just about every nasty joke you could want.  From sexual jokes to racist jokes...it's there. You'll be falling out of your seat!  it's drop dead funny!
0679731725|5.0|So eloquently written that it isn't until the last chapter that the reader realizes his/her heart has been ripped out.
B000002IV8|5.0|Overkill's 1993 release is nothing short of spectacular!  They incorporate all sorts of different metal styles here, from thrash (Dreaming In Columbian) to a very eerie instrumental (Ghost Dance).  There's even a  semi-balled here (Shades Of Grey)!  All in all, I'd have to put this one on   par with the best Slayer, Anthrax, and Metallica albums (the latter being  &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; in my estimation).
B00003CWQ2|5.0|Beautifully photographed and exquisitely directed, David Fincher's Fight Club is a full-on assault to the senses.  But don't get me wrong, this is not a bad thing.  The central plot revolves around a bored yuppie portrayed  by Edward Norton.  In his quest to find some higher meaning in life he  stumbles across two dominating characters, portrayed brilliantly by Helena  Bonham Carter and Brad Pitt.  The chance meeting between these individuals  will forever change his life as he is propelled into a grimy world of  support groups and bare knuckle fights.  While this may not be considered a  fun film to watch, it will stick with you long after it is over.  Bonham  Carter is devilishly good as the snooty Marla and Pitt is a fireball as the  macho Tyler Durden.  But again, it is Ed Norton who propels the film along.   <br />Although not a typical action movie, the pace moves very quickly  despite the two hour running time.  The fight scenes are indescribable as  Fincher shows the reality of what happens after being hit in the face.   Fight Club does have flaws but the end result will not disappoint.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD is tight! From the intro to the last song &quot;Criminal&quot; it played on my CD player! The interludes are funny and the songs are great. The beats are hella phat...I think Dre did some cause some of them sound  like those off of Dre's &quot;2001&quot; album. Anyway, this is in my CD  changer now and it'll be there for a long time. This CD has a little more  variety than &quot;Slim Shady-The LP&quot; so it'll suit everyones tastes.  Rather you prefer upbeat party type songs (like me), or you like songs to  chill to this is the CD for you. This is sure to be a classic.
0684874350|4.0|Angela's Ashes is a very heartwrenching story.  Born to a drunken father and a desperate mother, Frank learns at a young age to be the man of the family, caring for them in any way he can.  When Frank is about ten, his  father goes off to England in order to work a good job and send money home.   What he actually does is drink away every penny of his earnings leaving  his family of five to starve in the streets of Ireland.  He never does  return and Frank works doing anything he can find in order to feed his four  brothers and mother.  With each paycheck, however, he saves a bit to go to  America where he imagines all of his worries will be over.  It is a world  most of us can hardly imagine, constantly consumed with hunger, never  knowing how the rent will be paid or food provided for the next day.  To  have survived a childhood like this one, Frank McCourt must be an  extraordinary man.  To have written such a memoir, McCourt must be an even  more impressive mind and soul.  I look forward to picking up  &quot;Tis.&quot;
B00004T9UF|5.0|this album is dope! there aint no rapper out there that can compare  himself to this magnitude. i havn't even heard anyone top his reigning  solitude. and if you can? go ahead and try. but i don't think you can dude.
B00003BDXG|5.0|I don`t agree with the guy who said that NBK and JFK are MTV garbage. This film is not only about Media, is about TELEVISION about how people respond to violence. It is an unconventional film, but at this moment almost all the movies from Hollywood copy: the MTV fast style, loudly music, bizarre  images,etc. This film is a masterpiece because it show us the truth about  television, I saw this truth with my own eyes and you could see it too, if  you want to. Oliver Stone show us their hypocrisy and when I saw it in  everydaylife, on the news, I stoped watching T.V. You can say freely that  this film changed my life. It is not my favorite movie but I think it`s the  most important film of the 21 century. JFK is the most powerful film I have  seen, with the same hypnotic energy like this one has.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Wow, that is exactly what I said when I heard the Slim Shady LP. However, that album got kinda old after 3 months, since many of his songs had been played out. The Marshall Mathers LP is more and even better than the Slim  Shady LP.  The Marshall Mathers LP has fewer skits, and more songs, which  is better. The CD also has some better lyrics, and less chorus, since in  the Slim Shady LP, we saw the chorus to a song being the majority of the  song. Eminem's lyrics make you think more this time, and they also make you  laugh. What makes Em so appealing is the fact that his fans can feel him  when he writes. The beats this time are more diverse, but a little  improvement. The replay on this album is MUCH higher than the Slim Shady  LP. And this time around, we also got some Guest stars!   In the Marshall  Mathers LP, Eminem holds nothing back, since so much in his life has led  him to anger. His mother sueing him, Christina Aguilera basically calling  him a wife beater, and pop music in general. This is a GREAT CD, I think  anyone who likes MUSIC in general should get this CD. This CD will attract  fans of certain insane-type bands of heavy metal, comedy artist fans, and  of course, RAP FANS!
B00003CWRX|5.0|...to know what the movie is really about, and even then I'm not sure I caught everything. There were some great movies released in 1999, but as far as what movie had the most balls, for me it's a toss-up between Michael  Mann's meticulously crafted &quot;The Insider&quot; and &quot;South  Park&quot;. Personally, I see this movie as an indictment of all  corporations, be it Big Tobacco or the CBS Television Network. It's up to  strong-minded individuals like the Al Pacino character to keep these  bastards in check.
B00004T9UF|4.0|A mostly excellent collection of tracks. Eminem shows his rapping and lyrical supremacy best when he is alone. The best tracks are those without any guests. Starting with the catchy, in your face &quot;Kill You&quot;,  the album gets off on the right foot. Followed by the excellent  &quot;Stan&quot;, Em keeps flinging the great tracks, with &quot;Who  Knew&quot;, &quot;The Way I am&quot; &quot;The real slim shady&quot;  &quot;I'm Back&quot;, Marshall Mathers&quot;, &quot;Drug Ballad,&quot; and  the great closing &quot;Criminal.&quot; Slim really proves that he doesn't  care what anyone thinks, and that his music is basically his own outlet for  his aggressions. Don't expect this to be happy pop, or appropriate for the  little kids =). The detailed fantasy-murder of his ex in &quot;Kim&quot;  really shows this. Anyways, with exception for the few weaker tracks, the  jams are packed thick on this long disc.
B000002WMH|5.0|This is, quite simply, the best rock and roll box set ever assembled. When &quot;The Complete 50's Masters&quot; arrived, it became apparent that RCA was finally going to treat its most important catalogue with the respect  that it deserved. If you don't own any Elvis, this is the one to start  with, followed by the 1968 Comeback Special in its various incarnations,  and the equally valuable 60's Box Set. A fine companion piece to this  collection is the Gold Box Set, four CD's consisting mainly of Elvis' TV  appearance during his rise to the top. Long live the King...
B00004T9UF|4.0|Eminem comes again with a very good album. This album is not as good as the first one. His flow and the beats do not match his first album. Still, it's an outstanding album and a must buy. It's hard to come with a better  album after your first one was a classic. Another collab with Royce Da 5'9  would have been great. Standout tracks include &quot;Stan&quot; &quot;The  Way I Am&quot; &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot; &quot;Under The Influence&quot;  &quot;Criminal&quot;.
0671042858|4.0|As far as a Stephen King book goes, this is a little one - 262 pages in paperback, but a keeper. Within, young 9-year old Trisha becomes lost in the Maine woods after leaving her Mom and brother on the Appalachian Trail  to answer Nature's call. By the time she emerges from the wilderness more  than a week later, she's mosquito ravaged, nearly starved, suffering from  double pneumonia and hallucinations, filthy, ragged, and in the process of  being stalked by a malevolent bear. Not an adventure for sissies.<br />I  cannot remember a King novel that presents the reader with such an  attractive main character. And, in this book, Trisha is, for all intents  and purposes, the only character. A bravura one-girl performance. The fact  that she survives at all is due mostly to an incredible amount of pluck  that would make even the most indifferent of parents proud. She is also  buoyed-up during moments of despair by the presence of her Walkman, on  which she listens to broadcasts of games played by her beloved team, the  Boston Red Sox. On the team is relief pitcher Tom Gordon, on whom she has a  Major League Crush. It's not surprising, therefore, that some of her  hallucinations feature her stalwart hero. The odd thing is, though, his  ghostly presence at one point specifically directs her to the right path  towards rescue. Hmmm ...<br />This is not a \\"scary\\" tale in the Stephen King  tradition. Rather it's one of True Grit in the face of almost overwhelming  adversity, with just a hint of the paranormal. A cautionary tale (\\"Stay on  the path!\\") with a feel-good ending that might inspire you to touch the  visor of your favorite team's baseball cap, and point your index finger to  the sky.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! It deserves all of it's praise. Kevin Spacey delivers this film as a disillusioned middle-aged man looking to reclaim his life. He quits his job and starts obsessing over his  daughter's Lolita-like friend (Mena Suvari). I initially thought she was  the beauty described in the title, but the title really refers to the  beauty in our lives that we often neglect. One performance that is  overlooked (in my opinion) is that of Chris Cooper, who played the  next-door Marine soldier with a few surprises. Annette Bening and Thora  Birch round out the great performances. Living in suburbia often causes  people to take things for granted and losttouch with themselves. The movie  captured this perfectly. You can be sure I'll buy a copy of this film.
B00004RYZT|3.0|This video is pretty well put together - the camera angles most of the time are in the right place, and the sound is absolutely awesome!  My Problem with this DVD though is the energy, or lack of it from the band -  For about 95% of the concert the members of the band just stand in one  place and play their instruments with very little emotion, and thus the  crowd is very boring too.  There is very little dancing, headbanging and  moshing.  But on the upside, the interview is pretty cool and the beats and  rythm of the songs are very powerful.  This one is pretty well worth your  money.
B00004T8RK|2.0|Being a huge Pearl Jam fan I had to buy this new CD Binaural, I figured anything by PJ would be great.  I bought the CD and listened to it and I hate to say that I was disapointed.  Over the years that Pearl Jam has been  around there music has gotten softer and softer, most of the songs on this  CD are pratically light listening.  I wish PJ could get back to there roots  and play the kind of music that they are great at.  If you liked old Pearl  Jam music a lot and are into that kind of music, chances are you won't like  this CD much.
B000002G23|4.0|This is recommended for die hard Police fans and not someone who isn't casually attracted to the jazz-rock sound of this classic 80s british band. the b-sides and rarities, especially on the first 2 cds, along with  material from their first albums sound rather poppish and Police's attempts  at punk seem futile but are still &quot;listenworthy&quot; A Sting or  Police fan can almost make out the raw vocals of young Gordon Sumner in  some songs and the music on this is a testament that the untapped potential  of this band lives on after hearing their greatest hits. A good collection.  You wanted to own every Police song ever? this is your chance
B00004SVIK|5.0|This limited edition is indeed a box set.  The cover is a vertical rectangle hard box set, a similar cover to P.U.L.S.E., another live Pink Floyd Album, with 2 CD's of music and a 64 page book about the concert with  views on the show and album by members of the band and people involved,  including animation maven Gerald Scarfe.  This is one of those albums you  play in the car at maximum volume when you're all alone.  You'll feel like  you are there!  :)  It is not EXACTLY the same thing as the regular white  brick covered album, as it has some new songs on it, like What Shall We Do  Now and The Last Few Bricks.  The Last Few Bricks is an instrumental medley  of the many tunes found on the album, which is a pleasure to listen to.   You also get to hear the audience reactions, the concert MC, and the random  shout-outs by Roger W. and Dave G.  The extended instrumentals for alot of  the songs are superb, especially Another Brick II and Young Lust.  If you  are a Floyd fan, buy this album!  You won't be disappointed.
B00004T8RK|5.0|To say that this album lacks feeling takes a severe lack of feeling. The so-called &quot;fans&quot; that are saying this are the same shallow people that probably only like Pearl Jam's previous albums because their friends  do. I will not sink to the depths of your ignorance to defend Pearl Jam,  nor will I go on about how brilliant they truly are. All I will say is that  Pearl Jam is not only a band but a story. You have to read the entire story  from front to back and between the lines to pass any judgement, and to say  it is your favorite story you must learn to love and accept all chapters.   Any loyal fan stands behind their band. 5 Stars!
B000001FI7|5.0|On a personal level, this album would definitely rank as one the best albums of the twentieth century. 'Dummy' contains music of pure genius, with each song conveying a different set of emotions and distictiveness.  Portishead have been widely described as the archetypes of 'trip hop', but  they offer much more than that label suggests. The album contains a wide  range of musical influences, with the lead singer Beth Gibbons adapting  perfectly to the eclectic mix.  Gibbons has a passionate and controlled  voice, therefore enabling the listener to feel 'connected' to the music.  The songs mainly come across as being somewhat 'dark' and 'enigmatic', but  that only adds to the mysticism of the music. Standout tracks include the  achingly beautiful 'GloryBox'and 'Roads', 'Sour Times' and the haunting  tracks 'Mysterons'and 'Numb'. What more can I say? This is an extremely  well produced album which will leave you begging for more.
0688152023|4.0|very happy to find that the exercises are easy to follow and remember and don't require much time, space, equipment, etc. to be effective. and you can target specific areas or your whole body for your workout by picking  and choosing the ones you need and how much time you have.
B000031XCR|1.0|A decade of song is ten years too long for this unfortunate French Canadian export to the world.  If you want to induce sickness, you can play this CD really loud and I guarantee you will be vomiting within minutes.
0425129586|5.0|I've first read this book in high school, and this is one of the very few books I liked then and still like now! This is not a traditional Agatha Christie book, where a &quot;detective&quot; comes into the picture to  inverstigate a crime which was already a done deed, and comes along to find  the suspect. You see the crime being commited right before your eyes,  and  are aware of what everyone feels and thinks.
B00004KD1L|2.0|The funky fat boy slim remix of &quot;I See You Baby&quot; is what drew me to risk buying the whole CD.  For those of you who are looking for this type of groove I suggest buying the CD Single over finding disapointment in  the lack of similar dance grooves in the rest of the album.  Fat Boy Slim  rules the Dancefloor!
6303481345|5.0|This anime tells the story of a freelance ninja named Jubei.  He faces several formidable opponents, each with their own unique powers.  One can travel through shadows, another can turn his skin into rock and throw a  boomering like blade, and another has control over snakes, to name a few.   The animation is very nice, and the fight scenes are done extremely well;  you are totally immersed in the action.  Also, the plot is original and  creatively done.  Of all the anime I've seen, this is one of the best.  I  reccomend it to anyone interested in anime or ninjas.
B00003CX5A|5.0|It's not your parents Sleepy Hollow and it's even geared twords a younger audience by making the film , more complex a bigger story line the  films dark and gothic look makes Sleepy Hollow  look more poetic then it's  predeccesors your  caught up in world of intruge and nightmareish visuals  obviously Tim Burton loves this style and wich it's exactly right Sleepy  Hollow is  sposed to be a dark gothically spooky place and the story of  Icabad Crane and the Headless Horseman is captured just exactly right you  are caught up in a world of mystery and intruige.<br />     But you are  mesmorized from the time you put this movie in you DVD player to the time  you take it out , incredible visual effects and CGI for the Headless  Horseman.Fantastic effects eerie visuals and a fun movie to watch Tim  Burton has done it again this time on a classic and now Sleepy Hollow will  never die with this version it's and awsome  DVD with alot of options and  can keep you very busy a stunning epic film that is not afraid to tell this  story graphically.
B00003CX59|5.0|Sleepy Hollow is a wonderful movie, and it is veryyy spooky. Boo!  Gotchaa, Tim Burton is a wonderful director and this film shows all his talents. It takes place in a town called Sleepy Hollow, a weird and  mysterious place where peoples heads are being cut off, by a headless  horseman. This is one of those movies where you just gotta have, so I hope  you people buy it because your all gonna be in for a treat!  5 stars all  the way!
B00004SYWZ|5.0|Hi.  I never was a A-ha fan but I was with a friend of mine who is a massive a-ha fan the other day and I heard the CD Minor Earth Major Sky and couldn't believe it was the same group I would make jokes about.  <br />The  title track grabbed a hold of me, &quot;Summer Moved On&quot; wrapped me up  and &quot;I Wished I Cared&quot; delivered me into the ranks of a a-ha  fan.<br />If anybody reading this is sick and tired of the same old teenage  acts with no true kick to their music this is the album for you.  I will  warn you it does have a few week tracks like Velvet but the powerful ones  quickly out weigh them.<br />Give it a try and enjoy :)
B00000099Y|5.0|if your having trouble deciding if you want to buy this cd or not... read the title of my message.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Other than her lead off single &quot;Baby One More Time,&quot; I didn't like Spiers' first CD at all. So why did I buy the new one? Media hype, good reviews, and a infectious new single (&quot;Ooops... I Did It Again).  And guess what? Spiers' new sexy attitude and sexier growl have won me  over. The first five songs are delicious slices of pop perfection, and her  cover of the Stones' &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is a creative kiss off to her  detractors. The rest of the album is hit and miss (&quot;Dear Diary&quot;  is pure drivel -- teenage girls will love it). But this new CD is quite an  accomplishment for Ms. Spiers and her Europop producers. Turning 18 is the  best thing that ever happened to Brittany. Her music is maturing. Can't  wait to hear from her at 21.

078062999X|3.0|You can't employ the likes of Jack Lemmon (Marcellus) and expect to have a  great Shakespearean performance.  I would much rather have seen unknowns  who could pronounce their lines and understand the subtext.  <br />The setting  of the film is beautiful, and the fact it isn't medieval Denmark is okay by  me.  However, I didn't care much for the way the ghost scene was  handled--it came off like cheap pyrotechnics and bad cinematography rather  than a good performance.   Branagh's usual insightful performance is not  really present in this work.  He rushes his lines.  Having taught the play  and seen probably a dozen versions, I knew what he was saying anyway, but  someone who doesn't have most of the play memorized will not understand  half of what he says.  <br />Claudius, Gertrude and Polonius are well-done...  Kate Winslet carries off Ophelia fairly well.  But really, must we have  Robin Williams and Charleton Heston?  C'mon, Kenneth... let's stop thinking  so much about the gate and put more consideration into the quality of the  production itself.<br />After seeing Branagh's OTHELLO and MUCH ADO ABOUT  NOTHING, this film was a great disappointment.
B00003CWL5|1.0|Well, that may not be entirely accurate. I shouldn't say that this movie was a HUGE disappointment, simply because I went in with no expectations. And am I qualified to fully review?--since I was so bored with this film  that I walked out of the screening room after an hour? Maybe not. But I  will say this: AM has been called a sharp black comedy, commenting on  current American values. I didn't find the film particularly funny or  insightful (sorry folks--'King of Comedy' and 'Little Murders' w/Elliot  Gould still have more to say about American 'values' than this picture); I  didn't find the story particularly compelling (it reads more like a quiet,  suburban soap opera); and the performances didn't quite jell (the actors  all performed as if in different films, seperate from each other). To their  credit, Spacey (far better in t.v.'s WISEGUY) turned in a rather staid  performance, but this role was low on energy and believability. And I'm a  huge fan of Benning, but I will say that she gives it her all in a film  that is neither creatively photographed nor emotionally gripping, and  certainly doesn't do her any favors career-wise. All in all, it's a pretty  toothless effort from a group that should have been able to produce  something more. <br />And finally, I can say this: even an episode of FOX's  comedy series 'TITUS' is sharper and more scathing than this weak effort.  Personally, I find it a bit insulting that a British director seems to  think this script qualified as any sort of legitimate contemporary  commentary, especially for someone working inside the 'Hollywood system.'  But I suppose that being a director for the major studios certainly  qualifies him as a keen observer of Midwestern values and the human  condition. Is it any wonder the Bristish no longer have a legitimate film  community? We should have seen this one coming a long ways away, and turned  it back before it reached the shores.

B0000042MY|4.0|You cannot be a great movie on my list unless you have great music.  This music is better than great, it is Magnificent.  Actually first heard some  of the music off the television when the movie was playing and fell in love  with the strong main theme that seems to permeate each piece.  I have to  admit I love the Trevor Jones pieces more than the Randy Edeleman ones.   They are powerful and you can visualize each moment in the movie as it  plays.  I did like the track Cora, however.  It does give a bit of softness  to an otherwise pretty brutal movie.  I also agree the Promentory should  not have been cut and I would like to have had the full version of the  Clannad song, therefore the 4 star rating.  The sound track did introduce  me to Dougie MacLean though so will up the stars to four and a half. Have  to say it again, just MAGNIFICENT!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album takes the first amendment to the extreme- Em brings it together nicely in this collection of phat songs (mostly) directed by Dre. Even without the single, the real slim shady, this CD would still be as hot as  it is now!  The creativity in Eminem's songs is off the hook- he goes from  Britney Spears and boy bands to vicadent and his crazy mom. This album is  definetely twice as good as slim shady by far!
B00004T9UF|1.0|After listening to the Slim Shady LP many times, and hearing his cameos on 2001 I was quite impressed by Eminem.  He was very appealing, funny, and had creative raps. I have heard the single many times, I thought it was  alright (kinda of good) but I was waiting for the CD to come out to hear  the good stuff.  I do not think Slim Shady deserved a grammy but i thought  his last cd was very &quot;tight&quot;.  Marshall Mathers was a major let  down it turns out real slim shady is the best song.  I think Marshall  Mathers is already old and it has been out one day.  ON Slim shady were mm  was entertaining funning and appealing because of his situation (poor white  kid who got picked on did drugs had real problems) on Marshall Mathers he  gets tired to quick too many songs about his NAME him being WHITE although  he is the only white  &quot;artist&quot; on the album, and killing just to  appeal to the audience it is pointless.  Where bonnie and clyde was  somewhat fun Kim and the other songs like on the cd are sickening!  why  couldn't he be like that guy that looks exactly like him but sounds fresh  and exciting and skilled!  ...

When pregnancy enters the picture the couple decides that, for the present, life  on the road is not a good idea while the baby is on the way.  He then  accepts a position as a High School music teacher, just to make ends meet,  and to give him time to compose.  Then real life hits...<br />In the end it is  teaching, not performing, that defines Mr. Holland's life.  He is faced  with personal and family challenges, motivated and ambivalent students,  turbulent social times, and the continuing desire to compose...but there  never seems to be enough time to do everything.<br />This is an excellent  movie!  The acting is wonderful, and the story is compelling and  believable.  And the sound track is great.<br />This movie is a triubute to  the human spirit, and to the effect dedicated teachers can have on lives of  their students.  It deserves nothing less than 5 stars.<br />If you haven't  watched this movie, do yourself a favor and give it a look.  If, however,  your movie tastes are driven by action, adventure, high-tech special  effects, etc., then this movie may not be for you.<br />To all the teachers  out there -- of music and everything else -- THANK YOU! <br />Alan Holyoak
6304372620|5.0|A lot of controversy surrounded &quot;Sleepers&quot; regarding the author's claim that his work was based on a true story which actually took place in New York's Hell Kitchen in the 1960's. The New York State Juvenile  Authority and the New York City Police Department deny the story's  veracity.<br />Nonetheless, the story is outstanding. Set in the 60's, it  involves the lives of four boys and a girl from different families living  in Hell's Kitchen on the West Side of Manhattan.<br />The story does a fine  job or portraying the fact that these kids don't come from one of the  &quot;finer&quot; New York neighborhoods of the day. They are the kids of  single parents and hardworking blue collar folks. There is too much  drinking at home, domestic disputes, and other glimpses of a hard life  growing up.<br />The story kicks into high gear as the kids pass summer days  sunning and getting into hijinks. One of their antics is to cheat the hot  dog vendor out of his hot dogs. They do this once too often and a serious  chase ensues where the hotdog vendor pursues one of the kids for blocks  after he's been ripped off. The other three boys decide to move his hot dog  stand so he'll have to look for it when he returns.<br />Tragedy occurs when  there is a serious mishap with the hotdog cart that ends up hurting a  man.<br />The boys are charged with stealing the hot dog cart and associated  charges. They are sent to juvenile training school for rehabiliation  together.<br />The Training School is hellish. Guards led by a mean, hateful  Kevin Bacon; the kids are subjected to humiliation, solitary confinement,  verbal abuse as well as physical and sexual abuse. Bacon does a masterful  job of portraying a truly horrible human being who enjoys abusing  kids.<br />Years later the boys get a chance for payback against the guards.  <br />The story steps up from here as Brad Pitt (now an attorney) masterminds  the punishment of the four guards who abused the boys most.<br />His tactics  are effective. Yet, each of these men remain psychologically marked as a  result of the destroyed innocence of their youth.<br />Robert DeNiro does an  excellent job as the local parish priest who looks out for the boys. DeNiro  plays a tough, caring man who is a wonderful minister for the kind of  neighborhood his parish is located in. <br />Sleepers is memorable. Although  there are some very difficult scenes, I believe the abuse portrayed within  the Training School is not overly exaggerated. In a past time when guards  were minimally screened or trained, the treatment kids received wasn't  always the most professional.<br />I believe this will become one of  tomorrow's classic movies.

B00003CX59|5.0|When Tim Burton's name is on a movie, you know you're in for something else. As is the case with Sleepy Hollow.<br />This might seem like a horror movie, but it's actually more like morbid satire. With his usual sense of  visuals, Burton tells the story of the haunted town of Sleepy Hollow with  great expertise and lots of subtle humour. All actors do terriffic jobs.  Christina Ricci is wonderful as always, and I enjoyed all the near-cameo  appearances by actors such as Marin Landau.  And then there's Johnny Depp.  The man carries the whole movie on his shoulders in his absolutely  outstanding performance as the insecure and yet brilliant constable Ichabod  Crane. Depp displays countless subtle facial expressions that really makes  his character come to life. And everything else, from his voice to the way  he moves is beyond words. One of the best performances I've ever seen!  That's why I award this movie five stars. The script itself doesn't really  deserve more than four.<br />Be advised, though. If you want to see a really  scary horror movie, this is not for you. The same goes if you happen to  think that decapitations and humour don't belong together. <br />Burton keeps  surprising me. Sleepy Hollow might not be his greatest movie yet, but it's  certainly the funniest. And Johnny Depp is still developing his talent.  This is the third Burton film Depp has starred in, and I hope it won't be  the last.

B000000W5N|5.0|The perky riff to \\"Brown Sugar\\" that opens this great listening experience is a little misleading. After all, \\"Sticky Fingers\\" is mostly a mellow album with some pretty wayward themes tacked in. \\"Sway\\" contains a genuinely country swagger that will have you singing the chorus after just one listen. Also of note in \\"Sway\\" is Keith Richard's biting guitar licks at the end, and, for that matter, all throughout the record. \\"Wild  Horses\\" somewhat typifies the mellow vibe of \\"Sticky Fingers;\\" it's a dreamy and sentimental tune with a lot of maturity and grace, actually the type of song that could be played at a wedding or a karoke bar. \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" is the album's one raunchy rocker, as Mick Jagger barks out his observations and the team of Richards and Mick Taylor keep time with dirty guitars. There's a youthful-sounding chorus, unfeigned energy and true grit to these songs that is stellar. \\"Knocking\\" takes a strange turn at the end with a symphony of congas, a saxaphone and a guitar, all of which make for a cozy little jam that almost sounds impromptu by today's standards; rather than a polished studio sound and environment, the Stones elaborated musically at will. Evidently, these Brits just played for fun, and as usual, they hired an array of great musicians to help out: keyboards, trumpets, strings and sax, each a diverse instrument that does wonders within each song. The bluesy \\"You Gotta Move\\", a non-Stone song written by Fred McDowell and Rev. Gary Davis will grow on listeners. \\"Bitch\\" is way more anthemic, with a rolling groove and worldwide famous saxaphone hook heard at sporting events to this day. Mick Jagger sounded great in the early 1970s, as did Richards and Mick Taylor.<br /><br />Despite their raucous image, the Stones had a very astute, contemplative side. In fact, the last four songs are extremely laid back and compelling. \\"I Got the Blues\\" is self-explanatory, while \\"Sister Morphine\\" is a pretty brutal account of drugs in a way that only Mick, Keith and Marianne Faithfull could describe.  It's a daunting song that kicks in towards the  middle with the drums of Charlie Watts (another heavy drug user) and more eerie lines from Jagger. \\"Dead Flowers\\" is a great country ballad with yet more drug references and decadence, and the closer, \\"Moonlight Mile\\", is nothing short of perfect. Jagger hits the high notes in a way he probably can't capture  anymore, and the strings of Paul Buckmaster make the song a priceless closer.<br /><br />It's well-known and legendary that for a long time these guys lived without a care. In these songs, that feeling comes through in a homey and down-to-earth way.

B00004RJ74|4.0|Seth &amp; his brother Richie are just tryin' to make a clean getaway.  What happens next is anything but clean.  The movie starts off as a couple of guys trying to get South of the Border after a robbery.  They get there,  but it isn't the vacation they were looking for.  Once they get to Mexico,  things get a bit hairy.  No, not a believable turn of events, but there is  plenty of action and plenty of special effects.  This is no Academy Award  winning film, but it's fun and it shows George Clooney in a different light  than &quot;Dr. Doug Ross&quot;.

0767800478|2.0|\\"It Could Happen to You\\" was originally called \\"Cop Gives Waitress $2  Million Tip\\" and that is essentially what the film is about.  A  good-natured, honest cop (Nicholas Cage) finds himself in a diner one day  without enough money to leave his waitress (Bridget Fonda) a tip.  He makes  her a deal, though.  He will give her half of the winnings from a lottery  ticket he has just purchased.  She, of course, expects never to see him  again.<br />As you would imagine, the cop wins and his wife (Rosie Perez) is  ecstatic-at least until she finds out that he has promised to give the  waitress half of the money.  She viciously nags and berates him, but he  won't give in.  A promise is a promise.<br />The next day the cop returns and  informs the waitress that she has won $2 million.  She is disbelieving at  first, but soon comes around to the idea that all of her money troubles are  over.  They become instant celebrities in the New York media and their  faces are splashed across the cover of every tabloid.<br />The wife harbors  great feelings of anger and jealousy, though, and eventually kicks out the  cop.  He falls into the arms of the waitress, with whom he has been sharing  a budding, although chaste, romance.  Their relationship, though, has some  unexpected consequences which lead to the film's not-altogether unexpected  resolution.<br />Writer-director Andrew Bergman is one of the best in the  business when it comes to comedy.  He was responsible for \\"The Freshman\\"  and \\"Honeymoon in Vegas\\" among other hilarious films.  Unfortunately,  though, the emphasis in this picture is on romance, not comedy, and here  Bergman's touch is not nearly so deft.<br />The main problem is in the  screenplay.  The bulk of the film, especially the second act, is woefully  underwritten.  There is just not very much going on here and what does  happen is all too predictable.  The romance is touching, but never very  serious or moving, and the laughs are few and far between.<br />Even more  ruinous, though, is the performance of Rosie Perez.  Once again, she gives  her hysterical, hyper-kinetic, Puertan Rican-from-hell performance and it  is growing very tiresome indeed.  Her muddled accent and grating speech  impediment render her dialogue at times virtually incomprehensible.  Her  time on screen is always painful and all too lingering.<br />Nicholas Cage and  Bridget Fonda are both excellent, again proving themselves to be two of the  best actors in Hollywood.  They are well-cast and quite enjoyable.  They  are just not enough, though, to save the picture.
B000002KKC|5.0|'Tusk' is the first Fleetwood Mac album I ever bought and is far and away the best of all the Buckingham-Nicks era material. I said this once before  - one of the great aspects of Fleetwood Mac and their respective solo works  is that, combined together they offer an amazing range of textual and vocal  performances - enough to comprise a global village of sounds. For instance,  compare the raw quality of Stevie singing on 'Belladonna' to the  subliminally textured 'Sara' (my all time favourite song).<br />That said,  'Tusk' is an intricately woven textured and 'harmonied' album that easily  transcends the adult-oriented rock world of the 70s.<br />I am aware of other  criticism attacking the CD release with reference to the vicious  annihilation of 'Sara' (to which I agree wholeheartedly) but this review  will attempt to offer some reasons for why one should get 'Tusk' -be it on  LP or CD.<br />One of the greatest aspects of Fleetwood Mac (Lindsey) is their  ability to weave subliminal harmonies. No where is this better demonstrated  than on 'Honey Hi' or 'Brown Eyes' - to the point that Christine becomes as  haunting as Stevie ever was.<br />Lindsey's work is a tour de force here and  I have to admit that it is only in retrospect that I have come to cherish  songs such as 'Save Me a Place' -  a song with poetical angst that matches  'Sara'. Then there is 'The Ledge' and 'That's Enough For Me' - two very  short tracks with a racy tempo that bring a fiery relief to the album's  poetical angst. Where would we be without Lindsey's moaning screams?<br />'Sara' is something that takes me to another world  in all of it's  beauty. Fleetwood and McVie's rhythm work is exceptional with pauses and a  series of unregular beats. Others have suggested buying the album and  'burning' (as in copying) it. Another suggestion might be to buy 'The  Chain' (4 CD's not 2) and then 'burning' 'Tusk' with the complete version  on 'The Chain'. Furthermore, 'The Chain' offers alternate versions of songs  such as 'Brown Eyes' and 'Gypsy'.<br />Back to 'Tusk' - 'Storms' gives  Stevie's voice a smoky feel and accompanied with a terrific bass and simple  tambourine beat makes for compelling listening.<br />I really could go on and  on from 'Over and Over' to 'Never Forget'. 'Tusk' was hailed a critical  success at the time of release by many critics. What is more, critics who  denied 'Tusk' are now rethinking their stance. The point here is that,  'Tusk' is an important masterpiece and it will grow on you more and more -  it may take two years or twenty.<br />Finally, simplicity is often taken for  granted. At times, many of the tracks on 'Tusk' appear to be quite simple.  However,  A bob haircut looks easy to articulate for a hairdresser but it  isn't because its simplicity easily reveals flaws. Similarly, tennis at a  grand slam is made to look easy when seen on television but it isn't - they  are just professionals who master their craft well.<br />I read a review  below that stated this album was made for '$20,00' - I am under the  impression it was made in the vicinity of $1,000,000. Sure, that is  super-indulgent and admittedly so by Mac themselves. However, it should not  be forgotten that this technical achievement might be made to look easy to  articulate - but the reality of it is - is that it isn't. Fleetwood Mac  were never boring and never lazy - 'Tusk' exemplifies that over and over.

6303824382|3.0|Bruce Willis is back for a third go around as John McClane, the cop with the worst luck in the world. It seems everywhere McClane goes, he gets himself involved in the most outrageous and implausible-not to mention lethal-circumstances imaginable. This time is no different.<br />The plot, to the extent there is one, is pretty thin. A brilliant, but insane terrorist named Simon (Jeremy Irons) has planted several bombs around New York City. If McClane doesn't do what he tells him, then he'll start exploding the bombs. (Simon says do this, Simon says do that. Get it?)<br />McClane spends most of his time running around the city, from pay phone to pay phone, always arriving just in the nick of time. If this sounds familiar, then you've probably seen &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; which featured the same plot device, although it was used to better effect in that film.<br />The story is not really what is important in this film, however. It is mainly just a framework to hang the elaborate action sequences on. There are several of those and they are good ones. A massive explosion in a subway and a scene on a cargo ship are both quite spectacular. <br />In action movies nowadays it is pretty tough to outdo the last blockbuster film and come up with something new. The makers of &quot;Die Hard With a Vengeance&quot; have tried their best and they have done a fair job of it. There is nothing revolutionary here like you saw in &quot;True Lies,&quot; but the action is fast and furious and certainly never boring.

6303160344|4.0|&quot;Blue&quot; is the first film in Krzysztof Kieslowski's \\"Three Colors\\" trilogy that examines life in contemporary European society. Each of the three films corresponds to a color in the French flag and a segment  of the French national motto. They are &quot;Blue&quot; (liberté),  &quot;White&quot; (egalité) and &quot;Red&quot; (fraternité).<br />The theme  of liberty runs throughout &quot;Blue,&quot; but it is a cruel, unwelcome  liberty. The husband and daughter of Julie (Juliet Binoche), a young French  woman, are killed in a car accident at the beginning of the film. She, of  course, is devastated. She briefly considers suicide, but is unable to go  through with it. That would take an intensity of emotion-grief, loss,  despair, something-that she simply does not have. She is so cold inside  that she can feel nothing at all, not even sadness. (Blue, after all, is  the coldest color of the spectrum.) In one telling scene, Julie comes upon  her housekeeper who is weeping profusely. \\"Why are you crying?,\\" she asks  her. \\"I am crying,\\" the maid replies, \\"because you are not.\\"<br />Julie  decides that her only course of action is to free herself completely from  her past. She sells her house and all of her possessions and moves to an  apartment in Paris where she knows no one and no one knows her. The only  thing she keeps is her daughter's blue bead lamp, a colorful focal point in  her drab, spartan quarters, and the only reminder of her lost  life.<br />Before she can leave, though, Julie must give herself one final  test. She seduces Olivier (Benoit Regent), a rather dull former colleague  of her husband's who, not incidentally, is in love with her. They make love  on a solitary mattress in her empty house, but she feels nothing. Perhaps  she really is incapable of love. Having confirmed her suspicion, she walks  away without even a backward glance.<br />Julie's disappearance, however, is  difficult. Her late husband was a famous composer and they both remain the  subject of media interest and gossip. It is rumored that Julie actually  wrote his music herself, and it is true that the sounds of his last,  unfinished work haunt her throughout the film. No matter where she goes,  she cannot escape his (or is it her?) music because it lives within her  mind and her soul. Occasionally the action is stopped completely and the  screen fades to black, accompanied by the fortissimo sounds of his last,  farewell concerto. It is an interesting, risky device, but it works well in  conveying the dislocation, the sense of forever being apart from others,  that Julie feels.<br />In the most interesting twist in the film, Julie meets  her late husband's mistress, Sandrine, (Florence Pernel), a woman she did  not even know existed. Sandrine is pregnant with his baby, a shocking  revelation, but Julie does not hate her for it. Rather, she is remarkably  generous and kind, just as he had always promised Sandrine she was. All  Julie wants to know is, \\"Did he love you?\\" She answers her own question,  though, when she spots the cross hanging from Sandrine's neck, the same  beloved gift her husband gave to her.<br />Kieslowski takes his time in  telling his story. Things do not happen quickly, nor are events momentous  when they occur. The pacing is slow and languorous, but certainly never  boring. Unlike most movies made today, this is a quiet, subtle film.  Kieslowski and his cinematographer do a lot with the lighting, particularly  in the scenes in the swimming pool. Those shots are awash in soft,  evocative blue hues that give the scenes an exquisite, dream-like  feel.<br />The performances by all of the leads are splendid. Juliette Binoche  is truly a marvelous actress. She was so good in Godard's &quot;Hail  Mary&quot; and Malle's &quot;Damage,&quot; and she is even better here. Her  character does not say much, nor does she take much dramatic action. Most  of what we learn about her comes from staring into her sad eyes and  regardingher troubled face. She is able to convey so much, not with broad  strokes or grand gestures, but with intricate nuances and careful  expressions. It is a performance to treasure.<br />As I watched  &quot;Blue,&quot; I was reminded of another excellent French production,  &quot;Un Coeur en Hiver,&quot; that also dealt with painful music and the  tragedy of a cold, unfeeling heart. The similarities are subtle, but I  think both of these films demonstrate one quality sorely lacking in most  Hollywood pictures: maturity. The average major studio release is targeted  at the core demographic of 14 to 24 year old males, not exactly the most  discerning audience around. This strategy results in a lot of dreadful  films being made. Fortunately for those of us with a more highly developed  aesthetic sense, there are films like &quot;Blue&quot; around to satisfy  our longings.

I recomend this book to all ages for it is an intresting and entertaining book. So my question is WHY NOT READ THE GIVER.
6305524866|5.0|This utterly charming, little British film took me completely by surprise  the first time I saw it.  I did not know what to expect going in, but I  quickly found myself falling completely in love with it.<br />The plot is  structured around the five events mentioned in the title.  A magnificent  group of seven dear friends attends a string of weddings, none of them,  unfortunately, involving any of the principles.  Our focus is on Charles  (Hugh Grant), a devilishly handsome man who is completely incapable of  committing to marriage.  He is, as an ex-girlfriend describes him, a  \\"serial monogamist.\\"<br />There is some hope, however, that that might change  when Charles meets Carrie (Andie MacDowell), a beautiful American woman.   He falls in love with her, and we suspect she might love him, too, but  instead she gets engaged to Hamish (Corin Redgrave), a boring, but rich  man, twice her age.  Our hearts break along with Charles' because we know  that she is making a mistake.  He is too disappointed, though, and too  afraid to do anything about it.<br />There is something so pleasing about  friendship in a movie.  When it is done right, as it is here, it involves  the audience in a way that most stories cannot.  While watching this film,  I could not help but wish that I knew them all better.  Who wouldn't want a  group of such trusted and wonderful friends?  Because we like them, and  because we feel we know them so well, the events in the film aren't just  happening to somebody else.  They are happening to us as well.  That is why  &quot;Four Weddings&quot; is so touching and so moving.<br />The acting is  nothing short of brilliant, especially the work done by Hugh Grant.  Not  since Cary Grant has an actor displayed such suave, British charm and  natural good looks.  He is a delight to watch and, no doubt, has an  excellent future ahead for himself.  Andie MacDowell is equally enchanting.   She has never appeared as lovely in a movie before as she does here.<br />The  screenplay by Richard Curtis is extremely well written.  The scenes have  the ring of truth to them; the characters feel as real as anyone we know.   The writing always hits just the right note, striking a delicate balance  between moments of great humor and romance, as well as deep sadness.<br />Mike  Newell's direction is fine, never distracting us the center of the film:  the characters and their words.  At the same time, there are moments of  inspired visual artistry.  The sight of Charles arriving late for Carrie's  wedding, standing alone in a broad, Scottish moor, is touchingly sad.  Even  better is the funeral chapel, stranded in a bleak, industrial wasteland,  overlooking the dull, gray Thames.  It is a very evocative and poignant  moment.<br />I do not want to give the impression that this is a sad film  because it is not.  At times it is rather hilarious, the romance is always  enticing, and it does have a happy, if unexpected, ending.  More  importantly, all of its emotions are genuinely earned.   &quot;Four  Weddings and a Funeral&quot; is one of the most delightful films I have  seen in a long time.
B000009GS7|5.0|I'm amazed that this is out of print.  My understanding is that this album was a pivotal inspiration for Jimmy Page in creating the Led Zeppelin sound, and it sounds like it could very well be.  Page and Jones even  played on one cut.
0790731002|3.0|\\"Batman\\" may not be forever, but if this film is any indication of what the future holds for the Caped Crusader, he will be fighting crime for a long time to come.  Although this is far from a great film, it is  definitely the best of the series so far. <br />The story takes us back to the  forbidding confines of Gotham City, where evil is again running amok.  The  overly-complicated plot is largely the same as in the previous two  pictures; only the faces have changed.  The bad guys once again want to  take over Gotham and kill Batman.  He, of course, wants to stop them.<br />The  villains this time are the maniacal Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and his  crazed companion, the Riddler (Jim Carrey).  Together they chew through the  scenery like two fat guys fresh from Jennie Craig.  They're not very  frightening, but then, they're not supposed to be.  Two-Face is, however,  rather dull.  He could have been dropped entirely from the story without  hurting a thing.<br />The Riddler is much better.  After one particularly  outrageous scene, Carrey (in character) turns to the camera and asks, \\"Was  that over the top?\\"  The answer is a hearty \\"Yes--but keep it up!\\"  What  makes Carrey special is his boundless comic energy.  He's like a shark; if  he ever stops swimming he'll die.<br />In a welcome addition to the series,  \\"Batman Forever\\" finally introduces Robin (Chris O'Donnell), the Dark  Knight's faithful sidekick.  It gives a much-needed jolt to the film to see  the Dynamic Duo together at last.  They're relationship is one of the few  emotionally stirring parts of the movie.  <br />The thing that keeps the film  from being better is the screenplay.  Not only is the plot convoluted and  unoriginal, it's not even very interesting.  The writers would have done  better to come up with something new, not just deliver another rehash of  the original \\"Batman.\\" <br />The story, though, is not what is important in a  film like this.  People come to see the characters and, on that score, they  won't be disappointed.<br />Val Kilmer has taken over for Michael Keaton as  the title character and he is good.  Kilmer brings the humor, charisma and  sex appeal to the role that Keaton always lacked.  Batman is still too  brooding and low-key for my taste, but he is getting better.<br />Chris  O'Donnell furthers the youth movement with his star-making turn as Robin.   Sporting close-cropped hair and a newly-buffed body, O'Donnell had the guys  cheering and the girls swooning.<br />Nicole Kidman is ravishing as ever in  the improbable role of the abnormal psychology expert.  Her character is  not given much to do but stand around and look pretty.  Fortunately, Kidman  is very good at that.<br />&quot;Batman Forever&quot; is not a great film by  any stretch of the imagination. It is, however, a lot of fun to watch.
B00000IQBM|5.0|Wow!<br />That's my lasting impression of Stanley Kubrick's complete  Masterpiece of Psychological Terror. I first saw this movie when I was 11  years old(1981). It confused me greatly, but intrigued me at the same  time.Jack Nicholson was amazing in a role NO ONE ELSE could have played.  Shelley Duvall was miscast and out of her league, but it doesn't really  affect the movie that much, because besides Jack, Danny(the young son)  Lloyd is unbelievable in what had to be a very difficult role for such a  young boy. But the real star of this movie is THE OVERLOOK HOTEL. Kubrick's  amazing use of the camera adds to the eerie,isolated and extremely spooky  setting. The result is a psychological drama that is, in a word...SURREAL.  It is a long movie, but it never gets dull, it keeps you on the edge of  your seat with one eerie scene after another. I read this book long after I  saw the movie, the book was good, but the movie is better. Kubrick takes  King's novel to places that King himself couldn't have dreamed of. A  totally hypnotic tour de force by one of history's most underrated  directors and genius minds. Next to THE EXORCIST, this is the best horror  movie I've ever seen.
0790737302|5.0|Nicholas Cage (as Seth, an angel) asks Dennis Franz (now mortal and an avowed hedonist) &quot;what happened?&quot; Franz answers &quot;Free will brother, free will.&quot; This movie is in fact a celebration of free will,  which would have brought a smile to Sartre's face. Yes, it is an  overly-sappy love story, but the philosophical message is more important  than the superficial love story which is tantalizingly developed by Meg  Ryan.  To view this movie as a love story with religious overtones  is to  seriously short-change it. This movie is solely about THIS life, not the  afterlife. It is about living every moment to the fullest, and knowing that  each of us is the master (and artist/creator) of his/her own fate. The  music is great and is chosen well for the scenes.  Seth eventually  struggles with the meaning of life, even though in the back of his head he  is aware that life is absurd.  Albert Camus (pronounced Kamoo' ) wrote a  short story called &quot;The Myth of Sysiphus&quot; which details the  damnation of a mortal (Sysiphus) who must eternally roll a large rock up a  hill only to have it roll back down as a punishment for his choice to put  &quot;death&quot; in chains. Camus argues that it is impossible to punish a  person who has knowingly chosen his own fate. Hence he (triumphantly!)  writes &quot;I imagine Sysiphus happy.&quot;  After watching &quot;City of  Angels&quot;, I can only say that &quot;I imagine Seth happy.&quot;
6303212263|5.0|I first saw this movie in 1978 as a nine-year-old at the old Rialto theatre in Denison, Texas.  I had been a Superman fan for several years, and was absolutely thrilled by the whole thing.  The promotional ads at the  time said that the movie would &quot;make you believe a man can fly,&quot;  and that's exactly what it did.  I watched this movie several more times  during my pre-teen and teen years, but then I went several years without  watching it.  Then, in my late twenties, I decided to buy a copy of it on  tape so I could watch it anytime I wanted.  Well, I put that tape in for  the first time in years, and it completely grabbed me all over again.  The  scene in the wheat field where he told Ma Kent he had to leave almost made  me cry and I NEVER CRY AT MOVIES!  There was something about seeing it as  an adult that made it even more special.  In other words, this is not just  a movie for kids!  And one final thought-this movie is far superior to any  of the overblown Batman movies that came out over a decade later!
B000002TWN|5.0|love this. the man can write, the man can sing, the man can play. there are chilled grooves and more and a disparate feel that is lacking on 'Voodoo', which is a shame, because the variety and consistent excellence  of this album is surprising and refreshing. i also recommend you check out  'Live At The Jazz Cafe' on Import, which is well worth the extra money and  plays like a funkier addenda to 'Brown Sugar'. Go buy.
630575067X|3.0|Sure, it wasn't the worst movie ever made, but when you put Star Wars on the label, you had better have each part that made Star Wars memorable to start with.  I realize that it's nearly impossible for Lucas and co to  recreate that feeling, but couldn't they have had actors who believed in  their characters?  I'm sorry, but only the supporting cast was convincing.   Sure, Queen Armidillo was pretty, and basically the only decent actress  aside from the returning cast, and maybe Anakin(possible future in a few  years), and while Darth Maul didn't have Darth Vaders presence, he still  had the stare of evil.  Jar Jar Blinks was a decent 3D model, but as a  character, he was too annoying.  Definitely buy or rent it though, if only  to say that you want Episode 2 to come out and be better.  Que Gong Jim can  do a much better job than he did in this movie.  He was excellent in  Superman II and Schindlers list.  But if you want a movie with good actors,  and good FX, buy Galaxy Quest.  Its worth a whole lot more than this $100  million or however much piece of wasted film.
6302561841|5.0|Kids just love the old silent movies just as much as cartoons.  Expecially if there are as comic and timeless as Chaplin.
0385493800|5.0|The Testament, was a very outstanding novel. I got the chance to read the book for my Modern Literature class. When I started reading the book I found it very interesting and worth reading. Although this novel was not  based on a true story, but there are cases out there like the novel  &quot;The Testament.&quot; Children and wives use their husband for their  money and fight over their parents when they die. Although this happened,  Troy knew his money was going to one special lady which was his  illegitimate daughter. Troy's daughter was very spiritual and giving; she  worked for charity. Troy's lawyer Nate helped find Troy's daughter to let  her know about the money. Troy was soon put to rest, but he died in peace.  His daughter did a very good thing with the money. However she did not feel  the need to have the money; money meant nothing to her. I would highly  recommend this book for people to read. It shows you how people can take  advantage of their own family; all because of money. When I read the book I  was very shocked and could not believe what children did to their father,  but I knew that women used there husbands for money. Futhermore, I really  enjoyed reading the book and encourage others to do so as well.
B000002BFZ|5.0|No Code has an incredible mix of experimental, rocking and exceptional &quot;slow&quot; songs.  Present Tense, Sometimes, Off He Goes, Hail Hail, Smile, are great no matter how many times I listen.  The short Lukin is a  surf worthy rave up just raging with adrenalin.  The spoken-word IM OPEN is  expansive and a good curve ball in the mix.  Around the Bend, a reflective  song with sort of fleminco guitar riffs (reminds me of Neil Young's guitar  on his Eldorado song from the 'Freedom' Album), seals one of Pearl Jam's  finest complete works.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I don't hand out 5 stars for every album, like a lot of people seem to do for various albums.  But Eminem's new album is all I expected, plus about 10 times more.  Perfect beats, lyrics that blow away his previous stuff  (although it was awesome as well).  Eminem is truly a hard-working dude,  and when you mix his dope lyrics and innovative style with the tight  producing that Dre deals out, you have a masterpiece.  That's what this  album is.
B000005J56|5.0|I'm a long time collector of Cuban music and this is a terrific introduction.  Unlike many of the recordings I have from the 30's and 40's, this is a crystal clear recording with many Cuban classics like Dos  gardinias and Cuarto de Tula that are very hard to find.  Every once in a  while, Ry Cooder's guitar gets annoying, but that's a small complaint on an  album that is about as authentic as you can get.  If you speak Spanish (or  if you don't, read the excellent liner notes/translation), you'll  appreciate the songs even more, but it's not necessary.  Die hard fans of  this style will want to seek out the best &quot;son&quot; disc out there:  El son es el mas sublime -- it's not as well recorded since these are the  originals, but it has many famous son and son montunos.  I'm glad this  music has such a wide appeal.
B00000J7J4|5.0|<br />I really do not understand the harsh criticism this CD has received. <br />I've listened to it for about 2 weeks now and cannot find anything to criticize except that it's best not to listen to it on your headphones at  work because everyone will wonder why you're so happy!<br />I grew up with  Santana, but didn't worship his work.  I like this CD for what it is...a  set of happy, playful, contemporary music. Maybe it doesn't break new groud  or maybe it fails to be purely Latino or purely jazz/whatever else, but it  makes me want to get up and move....and it's fun and happy and it makes me  smile.<br />Enough said.<br />Enjoy!
B000001FDP|5.0|A very classical, choral work with a strong, almost trance like, electronic pulse. There are a good mix of pieces from the traditional melodic synth string pads we are familiar with to driving rythmic/hypnotic  pieces that simply spellbind you! The overall feel is......well.....all I  can describe it as, is electronic gothic. It's just so full of atmosphere  and dynamics. That Yamaha CS80 synth string sound that Vangelis uses on  everything (just about) is there in abundance. This mixed with the choral  elements and a fantastic use of gregorian chant, results in one of  Vangelis' best albums. I am an avid fan and it took me a little time to get  into this album. After a couple of weeks of listening to it ,on and off, I  put it on one day and the whole thing just clicked with me. I was  entranced!
B00004T9UF|5.0|Wow! Many lack luster artists run out material by their second album, but Eminem has not only come up with new original songs, he's matured as an artist as well. Much of the album deals with Eminem's reaction to sudden  stardom and his reflection on The Slim Shady LP. Listeners will notice this  right away with PSA 2000. Where PSA from the Slim Shady LP was a warning,  PSA 2000 is Eminem's response to criticism. &quot;Stan&quot; and  &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot; are both excellent tracks that express a new  Eminem who has experienced the goods and the bads of what it means to be  famous. Yet Eminem lets us know that he has not changed, other people's  perception of him has changed. Eminem weaves all of his emotions into the  trademark lyrical style that earned him a Grammy. The downside of Eminem's  original style is that guest rappers on the album seem out of place at  times. All in all, The Marshall Mathers LP is a brilliant follow-up to his  wildly successful debut album. Fans will not be disappointed!
0782008372|2.0|The poorest image quality I'v yet seen on a DVD.  Sound was decent but the video transfer from film to DVD is truly poor. Viewed on a 53&quot; Sony RPTV.  Poor image would be much less noticeable on a 27&quot; or so tube  TV.
B00002E285|4.0|No, contrary to popular opinion, this is not a stoner film to be enjoyed while on a heavy dose of controlled substances.  In fact, due to the horrifying content of the movie, I would not recommend watching this movie  on acid.  The fact that people hold such silly beliefs about this movie  only confirms the notion held by Roger Waters, Pink Floyd's then-front man  and the author of the script, that no matter how clearly you tell a story,  most people are just not bright enough or well-educated enough to  understand it.  Basically, the Wall is a very thrilling, extremely  disturbing music video that has an actual plot.  The plot concerns the  trials and tribulations of rock star Pink Floyd.  Most of the scenes are  anything but \\"trippy.\\"  The character Pink is a combination of  both Waters and original Floyd front man, Syd Barrett, who was forced out  of the group because he went insane, a condition some blamed on his heavy  use of hallucinogens.  If anything, this film is a statement against drugs.   I have no problem with people who don't like this film because they  believe it to be heavy-handed and self-serving, but if you hate it because  you don't understand it, that's only because you don't understand the  background of Pink Floyd.  Even people who despise this film -- including  those who are confused as to what it's about -- will admit that the  animation (which makes up maybe a quarter of the film) is amazing.  Though  this film does nothing to negate the widespread view of Waters as an  eccentric egomaniac, it is an ultimately moving journey of personal loss,  fame, insanity, and vulnerability.  There are two sequences that I have to  admit sickened even me.  One involves Pink turning into a worm, which isn't  half as bad as the scene in which he shaves off his nipples.  Other than  those two disgusting moments, the Wall has a number of memorable scenes  complimented by the classic album of the same title.  Highly recommended  for those who actually know something about the group.
0783241542|4.0|American Pie is a very funny movie.  It is about four high school friends who try to lose their virginiy by prom night.  The cast is mostly all newcomers like Jason Biggs, Chris Klein and Tara Reid but their are also  stars who have been around like that kid in Rookie of the Year.  They all  give pretty good performances and it makes for a very enjoyable experience.   The most suprising star is Jason Biggs, who turns out a very funny  performance and is also the star of the now famous apple pie scene.  There  is a lot of sexual content and profanity so easily offended people might  not enjoy it as much as people who don't have a problem with that stuff.   It is very funny though and fans of Porky's or Animal House will enjoy this  movie without a doubt in my mind.  So if you like to laugh I would  definitely recommend this movie.
B000002C1V|3.0|This might as well be a Roger Waters' solo album; the inside cover even says \\"an album by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd.\\"  Those who found the Wall incredibly self-serving and whiny may find this one even  more irritating.  Unlike the Wall, the music on the Final Cut is not up to  snub and will only make Floyd fans yearn for the days of Dark Side of the  Moon and Wish You Were Here.  This effort would be a total bust if it  weren't for the fact that, lyrically-speaking, this is probably the  greatest thing Waters ever did.  Sometimes considered a sequel to the  Wall, the Final Cut tells the dismal story of an elderly teacher who is  suffering from memories of the war in which he fought and his growing  belief that there is no justice in today's world.  Obviously, this isn't  exactly the type of stuff you'd lullabye your child to sleep with at night.   Though nowhere close to the musical achievement that the Wall was, this  album is more powerful in its words than any other Floyd album.  Dark Side  of the Moon is their best album (best in rock history as far as I'm  concerned), but the Final Cut is among their best pieces of work due to the  constantly progressing poetry of Roger Waters.  Three songs alone make the  album worth purchasing -- \\"The Post War Dream,\\" \\"The  Gunner's Dream,\\" and \\"The Final Cut.\\" \\"The Gunner's  Dream\\" is the best song on the album and is most likely one of the best songs Floyd ever released.  \\"The Final Cut\\" is the most painfully sad song of  the bunch and is arguably one of Floyd's greatest lyrical achievements.   Although \\"The Post War Dream\\" might have worked better as the  final song instead of the first, taken as an individual piece, it is  wonderful.  Some of the songs here aren't that great, though, and even more so than ever before, Floyd uses the same sounds over and over again because  Waters doesn't care enough about producing anything new musically.  This was a good album for Waters to use as his own personal Floyd finale, but he should have given David Gilmour a lot more responsiblity in creating it.   It's probably a good thing Waters left, though, because one more album  and those two guys might have killed each other.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson does it again.  Magnolia is on par with his previous effort &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; another excellent film.  I went into the movie theater thinking this movie was going to be okay, but man I was blown  away.  As you watch this movie it engulfs you in its intricate plot.  I  never knew what was going to happen next but I wanted to keep watching  because the characters were so interesting, especially Tom Cruise's  character T.J. Mackey who gives an astounding performance and should have  won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, not Michael Caine.  I saw  &quot;Cider House Rules&quot; and Caine was good but he wasn't as good as  Cruise.  This movie also has other great performances by Julliane Moore,  Phillip Baker Hall and many others who were also in &quot;Boogie  Nights&quot;. <br />This movie is very fast-paced and has a lot of characters.   One of the stories revolves around a child genius, one around a dying game  show host (the child is on the game show), one around a womanizing self  help guru who's motto about women is &quot;search and destroy&quot;, and  who's father (veteran actor Jason Robards, who he hates) is dying.  Another  is around Robards' character's wife, Julliane Moore, who married him for  money but after being with him for so long realizes that she actually does  love him, and one is around a cop who falls for a cocaine addict during a  routine disturbance call.  I think I covered them all but I'm not sure.   <br />This movie is very interesting, but long, so people who don't like long  movies might want to think twice before sitting down to watch it.  There is  also drug abuse, a lot of profanity, and some sexuality, so people easily  offended might want to avoid this movie.  But for people who liked  &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and who like fast-paced movies, this is for you.   It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you think.
B000002U82|5.0|No album flows as smoothly, conjures up as many different images, or takes you on such a great ride as Dark Side of the Moon.  This is the album that made Pink Floyd, and despite the belief of some that the Wall is a  superior album, this one is easily the group's finest work and just as  easily the best album ever produced (or at least the best I've ever heard).   While DSOTM isn't as powerful or startling as the Wall, it is far better  musically and doesn't involve all the self-pitying that seems to taint the  Wall.  The reason that DSOTM is so amazing is that it takes its listeners  on a journey and, because I've always felt the best albums transplant us to  another world, I can't possibly imagine anyone ever coming out with an  album that tops this one.  DSOTM is nearly flawless, with a number of peaks  and valleys that create several different moods and depths.  Just when  Floyd has rocked out with a song like \\"Money,\\" they follow up  with the perfect contrast of \\"Us and Them,\\" which soothes you  with its mellow sounds.  The combination of \\"Brain Damage\\" and  \\"Eclipse\\" as the finale of the album is one of the most  impressive achievements in music history.  Shamefully, I used to consider  \\"Money\\" the weak link of the album.  One day, though, I paid  close attention to the instrumental part of the song and realized that it  was one of the most incredible moments in the whole album.  If there is a  weak link, it's probably the second song, \\"On the Run,\\" which is  still pretty damned good.  \\"Breathe\\" is the perfect way to begin  this album and sets the tone for everything thing that will follow.  The  beautifully dark \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\" brings the first half to  a close marvelously while \\"Money\\" does an excellent job of  thrusting the listener into the second half.  And of course  \\"Time\\" is a wonderful classic, considered by many to be Pink  Floyd's best song.  The scary thing about this album is that it includes  only nine songs and about five or six of themcould be argued as the best  of the bunch.  Everybody should experience this kind of music, not just  stoners and Floyd freaks (which I suppose is what I am).
B00004T9UF|5.0|I'm not even going to front.  When Eminem first came out, I paid no attention to him.  When I saw &quot;My Name Is&quot; on BET for the first  time, all I noticed was the comedy act on the video and I could recognize a  Dr. Dre beat for the song.  But everybody was talking about his CD.  Then  Dr. Dre's &quot;Chronic 2001&quot; came out and I was feelin' Eminem's  verses on &quot;What's The Difference&quot; and &quot;Forgot About  Dre&quot;.  Then, Funkmaster Flex and Big Kap released &quot;The  Tunnel&quot; and Eminem and Dr. Dre had a track on their called &quot;If I  Get Locked Up&quot; that was the best song on the CD.   After, hearing my  roomate say 50 times, &quot;Eminem's &quot;Slim Shady LP&quot; is tight, I  finally bought it.  The CD was tight and the songs I liked the most were  &quot;Guilty Conscience&quot; and &quot;Role Model&quot;.  Now after buying  his 1st CD months after it was released, I decided that I would not make  the same mistake with &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;.  This CD is one  of the best that have been released in the year 2000.  The way Eminem can  mix his twisted humor and harsh realities in his past into tight, memorable  rap songs is a skill in its own.  First of all I should warn some listeners  that &quot;Slim Shady&quot; is not for everybody.  Eminem's split  personality is sickening at some times to people that aren't used to his  lyrics.  To me it's a clever niche that Eminem has created in hip hop that  will keep him around for a long time.  &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;  is filled with tight songs.  Dr. Dre and Eminem make a perfect combination,  reminiscent of Dr. Dre and Snoop in the &quot;Chronic&quot; days.  &quot;Kill You&quot;, &quot;Who Knew&quot;, &quot;I'm Back&quot; and  &quot;Remember Me&quot; w/RBX and Sticky Fingaz are all classics from the  Dr. Dre and Melman production boards.  &quot;Drug Ballad&quot; and  &quot;Kim&quot; are also tight.  The two best tracks, on the CD, however  are B Please II w/Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Xzibit and  &quot;Stan&quot; w/Dido.  On &quot;B Please 2&quot; Eminem shows that he  can flow with the 2 of the West's best, Snoop Dogg and Xzibit.   &quot;Stan&quot; is one of Eminem's most creative tracks.  It's about one  of Eminem's fans that writes him letters, comparing him to Eminem's so  called life.  For the first three verses, Eminem tells Stan's side of the  story, and each verse as they go on comes with more rage than the other.   The last verse has Eminem telling Stan about getting his life together and  to separate &quot;Slim Shady&quot; from Eminem.  Don't always believe in  everything you hear.  This CD is a classic for true hip hop fans, some  people, however, might not be able to tolerate all the lyrics.
B000002C1W|2.0|The first album without Roger Waters, the backbone of Floyd since the glory days of Dark Side, is the first for the new and unimproved Pink Fraud.  David Gilmour is a great musician, but he couldn't write a decent  lyric to save his life.  Without Waters' lyrics to inspire him, Gilmour and  the rest of the Fraud fall flat with this lackluster effort.  There are two  good songs, count 'em, two: &quot;Learning to Fly,&quot; which would even  make an excellent authentic Floyd song, and &quot;On the Turning  Away,&quot; which is kind of weinie but is still pretty good.  I have  suspicions that outside man and former cohort of the band that legimately  called themselves Pink Floyd, Bob Ezrin, wrote the lyrics to &quot;Learning  to Fly.&quot;  There is no way Gilmour could have written such wonderful  words.  Pink Fraud's first album features such awful tracks as &quot;The  Dogs of War&quot; and &quot;A New Machine,&quot; two songs that should have  been titled, &quot;We Need You Back, Roger Waters: Parts 1 and 2.&quot;   The rest of Permanent Lapse of Good Music is utterly forgettable.   Fortunately, I didn't waste any money on this piece of trash.  My aunt gave  it to me because she couldn't bare the embarrassment of owning it herself.   Unfortunately, I spent almost an hour listening to it.  Those who thought  the Final Cut a weak musical effort will take it back when they hear this  sad attempt to make up for the fact that the real Pink Floyd is no longer  with us.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Is this the dopest CD to come out in a long time or what!   I mean Slim Shady has it's high points, but Marshall Mathers was just warming up.  This sophmore release has a much more serious side to it and feels as if alot  more of his true thoughts are displayed.  Tracks like &quot;Stan&quot; and  &quot;Kim&quot; are high points that will blow your freakin' mind and the  rest of the CD is just as good.  As most of you Eminem fans did on Eminem  Tuesday, GO BUY THIS CD!
B000002UA0|4.0|Okay, this is an impressive debut album and it's certainly filled with a lot of imagination (it ought to be; the guy who wrote most of it went insane).  To this reviewer, however, it's just a little too whimsically  psychadelic to be considered a classic.  I can appreciate individual songs  like \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" \\"The Gnome,\\" and  \\"Bike,\\" but I could never listen to this album more than maybe once a week, if that often.  This was the only Floyd album that featured  Syd Barrett, who would eventually be ousted from the group due to extreme mental illness.  Barrett was pretty much the whole group at this point,  writing the majority of the songs, handling the lead vocals, and playing lead guitar.  It is beyond dispute that he was more talented musically than Waters, Mason, or Wright (Gilmour was the most talented musician Floyd ever boasted, but he wasn't in the group yet), but Barrett's lyrics are  nowhere near as sophisticated or hard-hitting as the ones that Waters  would eventually write.  Though this album is well-worth buying, it is not  even one of Floyd's five best and, I have to think that if Barrett had  stayed in the group, this type of stuff would have gotten really tiresome after about three albums and Floyd would not have gained nearly as much respect as it eventually did.  It's a solid album, impressive even, but if  you're expecting the classic Floyd sound, skip straight to their later stuff.
B000002OX5|5.0|In &quot;Sell Out&quot;, the Who have fullfilled what, probably, at the time, none belived they could do. &quot;A quick one&quot; was a good album, with some very decent tracks, but &quot;Sell Out&quot; was far far far away  better. It is mostly the songwriting which makes it so good. Townsend and  Entwistle were at their peak of creativity. The songs are short and  beutiful. Three and a half minutes of heaven. The production (Lambert?) is  fantastic. This extended version is much better than the original. All  these great bonus tracks such as :&quot;Early morning call taxi&quot; are  additions to the great: &quot;Relax&quot;, &quot;Armnia- city in the  sky&quot;, and the mighty &quot;Tatto&quot; which has one of Daltrey's best  performance.
6304233639|2.0|This is the type of movie that people like because it has a lot of cool special effects and not a whole lot to think about.  Unfortunately, special effects hardly impress this reviewer.  Will Smith is somewhat likeable in  this film and Judd Hersch is funny (although he could never top his work in  Taxi).  The prospect of a Bill Pullman presidential administration is more  frightening than the thought of aliens attacking the earth.  If a guy as  cheesy and pathetic as Pullman ever got elected, I would pray for an alien  attack.  Pullman's speech to the pilots before they conquer the aliens is  both laim and sad.  As always, Jeff Goldblum is just awkwardly unfunny  enough to make anyone with any type of standards want to lose his lunch.   There are some hot chicks in this movie, which would have been helped a  little if these chicks had appeared wearing less clothing.  This is  certainly not the worst special effects movie ever made, but it does little  to detract from the minority opinion that special effects are usually used  as a substitute for plot.
B000031WD9|5.0|American Pie is a movie about four seniors trying to get laid. Oh this had to be the funniest movie I have ever seen in my life. If I could compare this movie to &quot;Animal House&quot; I would. Jim is Bluto and Steve  Stiffler ( a party animal) is like Pinto, while Finch is like Flounder.This  movie was pretty much the 90's Animal House. The women in this movie are  babealicious!  Nadia is ssssooooo hot I can't wait for her new movie (  comming out this summer, featuring Jim who is the main character in  american pie). Vickey is ssssooooo hot too.To bad she doesn't get naked too  :). My favorite part in the whole movie (other than the nudity) is the 2  milf guys. Those guys make me fall out of my chair everytime&quot;! MILF  MILF MILF MILF MILF! This is a great movie about sex, sports, and  highschool!  Every male in america should have this!
0780626966|5.0|This is an outstanding DVD collection.  I would have to say it's the crown  jewel of all my DVD's.  I only have two little problems with it.  One, the  version for Disc 5 is the R-rated one and not the unrated one I've seen  before.  Not a big problem, but I was kind of confused that the right  version wouldn't be included for a set that is supposed to cater to the  diehard Nightmare fan.  Two, in my Labyrinth portion of the eighth disc,  I'm stuck on one particular spot and the damn game won't let me get any  farther.  There is a door with some fencing in the window and the cursor  only goes on small parts of the fencing, without opening the door.  So it  won't let me get to the second alternate ending to Part 1.  Can anyone out  there help me out with getting past this?  I'd appreciate it. Other than  those small complaints, this is a flawless set and it proves once again  that New Line is the very best when it comes to releasing DVD's...
B00004T9UF|1.0|And you thought that Vanilla Ice was a bad rapper just wait till you here the Marshall Mathers LP. .... This guy raps about jibberish. One minute he's talking about his exwife and the next  minute he's talkin about NSYNC or NSTYNC as he calls it. Thats the only  thing I agree with on this album :) Oh man don't purchase this you are  wasting money. ...  Remember White Guys  can't Rap!
630382790X|5.0|Even if director Ron Howard directs nothing but dogs for the rest of his career, he made himself a place in history with this film.  (He has also clearly made the jump from one side of the camera [The Music Man, Happy  Days, Andy Griffith, ...] to the other -- no mean feat.)  The  cinematography is superb, the acting outstanding, and the story incredibly  intense and moving.  (The liftoff scene always chokes me up, for instance.)  This film sends a visceral message of why the outreach into space must not  be abandoned.  And don't miss the alleged uncredited cameo appearance of  Jim Lovell, the actual Apollo 13 mission commander, as the skipper of the  recovery ship Iwo Jima. If you believe in the space programme, this can be  a real uplifting tear-jerker; if you don't support the exploration of  space, it does an excellent job of depicting the passion and commitment of  those who do.  A must-see.
B00000J2KV|5.0|When asked what he thought of Kubrick's film of Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov said it was a &quot;first-rate&quot; film by an &quot;artist.&quot;  Even though only about twenty percent of his script made it into the final movie  product, Nabokov was obviously impressed.  The theatrical trailers ask the  question, &quot;How did they ever make a film of Lolita?&quot;  The only  way, in 1962, a movie could be made about such a controversial subject was  if it was presented as a comedy.  James Mason as Humbert Humbert is  excellent--speaks volumes with his eyes.  Perhaps Sue Lyon as Lolita is a  bit too old--she certainly doesn't fit the strict definition of a nymphet  (aged 9-14, as the book mentions), although she was, I believe, 13 when the  filming started.  Maybe Peter Sellers as Quilty isn't as serious as his  character may warrant, and may steal some scenes with his impersonations.   But so what?  We're talking about a movie made in the early sixties--the  theatre audience has certain expectations.
0380002930|5.0|I first read this book when I was in fourth grade, and loved it.  I remember they used to show the movie on CBS roughly once a year, and every time I would forget what it was about and enjoy it all over again.  I took  the book with me to the Soviet Union when I was in high school, and wound  up giving it to a girl we were travelling with.  It even got me hooked on  Magic Cards, since the &quot;Thunder Spirits&quot; card has a quote from  Watership down on it.  I figured, if they're quoting WD, they can't be  complete hacks.<br />Very few books have gained the high place in my canon of  stories that this one has.  It takes an all-too human story - the desire to  find and secure a place in life and society - and presents it from an alien  angle.  By writing about these rabbits, Adams is able to point out many  qualities, both good and bad, that we ourselves possess.  With gracefully  handled allegory, Adams shows us how nobility, courage and trickery can  overcome any evil, and can bring us to the promised land we have always  looked for.<br />What surprises most people upon whom I force this book is the  characterization.  One wouldn't expect, knowing that the book is about  rabbits, to see the intensely well-defined characters that appear in this  story.  Everyone, from major characters such as Fiver and Woundwort to  others, such as Silver, Blackavar and Bluebell, all have unique qualities  with which one can identify and empathize.<br />Somehow, reading this book  always makes me feel a little more at peace with the world.  I'm not sure  why yet.  Looks like I'll have to read it a few more times.
0679736646|5.0|After reading UBIK, I have become totally hooked on PKD.  <br />I am a big traditional sci-fi fan and although PKD is anything but traditional, I think he embodies everything that's great about SF.  Only this genre allows  people like PKD complete freedom to twist their literary reality into  anything they desire.  Needless to say, Philip K. Dick is an absolute  master of that!  <br />The only other SF writer whose style seems a little  similar is Alfred Bester.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|At least it's here!  the new album is so gr8! a bit depressing sometimes but more mature, more achieved.  Welcome back!
B00004T8RK|5.0|This album more than met my expectations...Although it may be a fruitless effort to compare pearl jam albums with one another, I can't understand why people have such negative things to say about Binaural. The tracks on this  album individually show more development than those on any other album.  Just because there isn't a song that sounds like Even Flow or Alive, does  that make it a bad album? Does that make it &quot;fall short&quot;? What  other comments have I heard? &quot;Not fun&quot;..what are you talking  about? If any album isn't fun, it's Ten (not much variation between songs  and very little risk was taken). &quot;The songs don't stick in my  head&quot;..isn't that kindof a good thing? The less developed a song is,  the easier it will stick in your head. Example: Green Day -vs- Soundgarden.  3-chord junk songs versus actual skill. Give the album a few more listens.  In addition, if the songs don't stick in your head, then they will age well  as a consequence. You won't get tired of them as easily as you would  &quot;Jeremy.&quot; Binaural also can boast the most equal contributions  amongst band members in terms of song composition. Jeff, Stone, and Eddie  have really made an effort to work together on this album. Matt Cameron on  drums also gives this album alot of energy, and a different feel from the  previous albums. While Ten did not take enough risks, Vitalogy (one of my  other favorite albums) peaked with creativity; however, take note of all  the filler songs, including pry to, aye davinita, and  heyfoxymophandlemamathatsme. No Code was very searching and reflective, but  didn't rock in the way that many people liked. Yield was diverse and  rocking, but exhausting to listen to the whole way through. Binaural pulls  it all together, and while it may not contain an &quot;anthem&quot; that  you and your buddies can sing along to, I ask once again, isn't that a good  thing?
B0000027RK|5.0|Ten is PJ's best album, hands down.  I have most of their other CDs, and while I love them all and they each have their own magic, Ten is the king.  Jeremy, Black, Even Flow and Alive are the best tracks, because I feel they  have the most emotion.  I have never heard a band put so much emotion into  their songs.  I think if you are a budding PJ fan, and you don't have Ten,  you HAVE to get it.  Trust me, you won't be dissappointed.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with Moby's CD.  I bought it for the songs Natural blues, Porcelain and Body Rock. I was expecting the songs to be really dance orientated and I was surprised to find that many weren't.  There were a lot of soothing instrumental songs.   The CD has a lot heart  and soul. I especially like Why does my heart feel so bad? Overall, there  is a good mix of techno and soul. Play is definately one of my favorite CDs  and I highly recomend it.
0425148343|4.0|For those who enjoy a police procedural, not to be confused with a thriller/suspense novel/mystery, this will not disappoint.  Inspector Banks makes another appearance when a well-dressed couple pose as social workers  and take away Gemma Scupham on the pretense of abuse allegations.  The  mother, Brenda, accepts them at their word and lets them take her away.  A  far from exemplary parent, the child is described as &quot;woeful&quot; if  not abused physically, then abused by maternal neglect.  Banks is on the  case leading him down to various possibilities.  Is it a  pornographic/prostitution ring?  Is it connected to a recent electronics  warehouse heist?  Is this related at all to another murder of a two-bit  small time crook?  What makes this one an exceptionally interesting read to  fans of the Inspector Banks series, is Superintendant Gristhorpe, usually a  behind the scenes player, takes the forefront in the investigation.  We  learn a bit more of his character and what his detective abilities are.  He  is taking this case personally after being haunted for over thirty years by  a similar case.  The story is far from contrived and the ending is truly  surprising.  Robinson does it again.
B000000FG8|5.0|I highly recommend this album. It deserves to be in everyones cd collection. When I bought it, I really didnt know too much about OpIvy aside from a few songs. Now I have owned the album for a while and every  song is good including some songs I consider to be great. Whether you  consider yourself a &quot;punk&quot; or not, give these guys a listen  before adding your opinion. I guarantee you will fall in love with this  record, unless you are one of those people that won't buy it because it is  not a certain, trendy genre of music. I for example am open to all kinds of  music as long as it has something to say. OpIvy speaks about real issues  and problems that plague society. This stuff is essential music to helping  make change. You so called Punks need to realize what this movement is all  about...its not about the attire, piercings, mohawks, etc...its about  social change, end to injustice, unity-all topics on which OpIvy sings. In  conclusion, do yourself a favor and buy this album. Hope this helps anyone.  peace.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I just bought this pitiful imitation of Black music for my niece.  What a mistake.  I strongly suggest investing in the real deal instead of the fake junk!  Britney Spears is by no means Janet Jackson- give it up girl!
0790731452|5.0|When I first saw this movie I thought it was so funny! My friends thought it was a stupid movie, but I did not care about them. I liked this because it sort of reminded me of &quot;Ed Wood&quot;. And as for all you people  who hated you did not get the joke! see this movie now!
0380778556|1.0|Even as a high school English teacher, this book was a little too wordy, and the climax wasn't really that great.  If I were to rewrite this book, I would take out a word or two a sentence to shorten the book and Miss  DuMaurier could have used some more events rather than just the second Mrs.  DeWinter comparing herself to Rebecca, Maxim's first wife.  The Ben  character was underused, and Mrs. Danvers could have been more sinister.  That is why I gave this book 1 Star.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is straight tight. All his tracks involve the creativity that only Shady can bring. Combined with Dre's production entertainment is had by all. Kim, Amityville, and Stan are the greatest examples of Em's  creativness.Add Dre, Snoop, Xzibit, and Nate to the mix on track #15, tight  beats from 'Drug Ballad', 'The Way I Am', and 'Criminal', and even harder  rappin' style and you got the tightest album of 2000.
6303168507|5.0|How can I describe this movie?  Intense, horrifing, heartbreaking, incredible.  This movie is all of these and more.  The movie portrays Oskar Schindler, a German capitalist who takes advantage of the Nazi's use of  Jews as slave labor.  As the movie progresses we see Schindler (portrayed  wonderfully by Liam Neeson) begin to see the evil all around him and his  determination to do anything he can to save his workers.  This movie does  not cut anything-we are forced to watch the horrors the Nazi's performed on  the Jews.  Ralph Finnes as the horrible Nazi Amon Geth should have won the  Oscar he was nominated for.  If you have not seen this picture rent it, buy  it, or borrow it.  But definitely see it!
B000002LA2|4.0|As an introduction here, let me say that if you are a die-hard fan of Clapton's guitar playing, you will not hear much on this album. This recording seems to show Clapton in much more of an R+B, pop-oriented mood.  While I liked this album in its entirety, I felt the mix was not the best.  The keyboards are always out front (weren't they all in the 80's?) which  takes away from the feel of Clapton's performance. Most likely, this was  due in large part to Phil Collins production efforts as his solo efforts  and work with Genesis are extremely keyboard oriented. As far as individual  tracks are concerned, &quot;Holy Mother&quot; was my favorite cut. It  evoked the same feeling for me as Clapton's much older song &quot;Presence  of the Lord&quot;. Coming in second would be &quot;Tearing Us Apart&quot;,  but then again, I am also a serious Tina Turner fan so maybe I'm a little  biased here. Overall, this disc is not the best Clapton has done. I gave it  four stars rather than five because it just doesn't seem to equal  &quot;Backless&quot; or &quot;Slowhand&quot;, but it is definitely worth  the money.
0553214624|5.0|&quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is Thackeray's masterpiece and on a par with the best of Dickens' work.  Alternating deftly between tragedy and comedy, it is a story rich in character development and historical accuracy.  The  famous pre-Waterloo ball given by the Duchess of Richmond is described in  detail and is one of the highlights of the book.  Becky Sharp is certainly  a model for all the other treacherous femme fatales that follow her in  literature, particularly Scarlett O'Hara. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is  undoubtedly one of the great works of the 1900's and it has surely stood  the test of time.  It may be &quot;A Novel Without a Hero&quot; but its  characters are real flesh and blood human beings.
B00004T8RK|2.0|If you enjoy bands like Creed and Kid Rock and current hard rock/alternative music ignore this review. This is for those who like I, much prefer Phish, Allman Bros., Grateful Dead, etc. Pearl Jam used to be my favorite band...My interest in the band faded after Vitalogy, but I  decided to pick up this CD because I am going to see them live this summer.  I don't want to sound like a 95 year old woman, but to me it sounds like a  bunch of noise with little focus. It is very difficult to distinguish each  guitar part. It seems like there is so much distortion and reverb on the  songs that they all mesh together to form a mass of noise. The slow songs  are certainly not up to the standards of anything off of their first three  albums. I wasn't expecting another &quot;Ten&quot; but didn't expect a 2  star album.
B00004SYWZ|4.0|What a great album. The production quality on many of the songs leaves something to be desired, but otherwise the album does a great job of re-introducing a-ha to the world.<br />Singer Morten Harket tries his hand at  writing songs for the band for the first time on this album. (Devoted fans  will know he made small contributions to Take On Me and Touchy!.) Thought  That It Was You is truly one of the best songs on the album, and because an  acquaintance of Morten's produced the track, it's much &quot;fuller&quot;  sounding than many other tracks on Minor Earth   Major Sky (which were  primarily produced by Boogieman).<br />Magne's song I Wish I Cared is a  haunting melody and my favorite track. I Won't Forget Her is another great  tune on the album. The autobiographical song The Company Man is great, but  I feel it's unfinished -- I can imagine at least two more verses about  a-ha's experiences with fame. I like Summer Moved On the more I hear it.  Songs like You'll Never Get Over Me and Barely Hanging On are signature Pal  Waaktaar tunes.<br />a-ha is back! And they sound more mature than ever  before. Play this album loudly in your car with the windows rolled down so  everyone can enjoy it.
B00003CX5A|3.0|I feel about Sleepy Hollow just as I do many of Tim Burton's movies.  The cinematography is there, the costumes are there, the music is there, the action and pacing are there--but Burton gives me nothing that makes me care  one way or another about these characters.<br />Great characterization is, to  me, what separates the truly great movies from those that are merely  mechanically proficient.  It's like listening to a virtuoso guitarist who  does not have any soul or feeling in his music.  You can marvel at his  technical proficiency, and you have to respect the dedication and hours of  practice, but if the music doesn't move you, what's the point?<br />This is  what I felt like after seeing Sleepy Hollow.  Burton gave me nothing that  made me care whether any of the characters lived or died.  The characters  are merely props to move the story along.  I'm not saying every character  has to be likable, but rather the director/writer/actor must make me care  one way or the other.  I will say that an exception to this rule was Mars  Attacks, which was a ridiculous comedy farce that I loved--character is not  so much of an issue in that type of a movie.  Given that characterization  is Burton's weak point, Mars Attacks was a great type of movie for Burton  because of the lack of a requirement for characterization.<br />That said, I  know that there are lots of people who love Tim Burton's movies, and I have  a great deal of respect for Burton's work, but if you are the type of  person, like me, who requires great characters to pull you into a movie,  Sleepy Hollow might not be for you.  If you've liked lots of Burton's other  movies, though, then you'll most likely love this one too.  It certainly is  well executed.
B0000070QS|5.0|I'm a great fan of Morten's, but I was still a little skeptical that Morten could put out a solo album as good as any a-ha album. Shame on me! This album is fantastic -- it's emotional, romantic, serious, and full of  hope. I can't believe Morten didn't contribute to a-ha's songs more.<br />Tell  Me What You See is my favorite song on the album, though Half In Love, Los  Angeles, and Spanish Steps are great. Brodsky Tune is eye-opening and  honest. A Kind of Christmas Card is a grungy-sounding departure from  anything a-ha has done. <br />A friend of mine came to visit me with her  16-month-old daughter and the child was homesick and very cranky for the  most of her stay. But during one of her crying jags, we played Lay Me Down  Tonight for her and she instantly relaxed and fell asleep. I can't wait to  have children of my own so I can sing that lullaby to them someday.<br />A  great album that deserves more respect internationally. Go Morten!
B000002KE2|5.0|Anyone who doesn't like this album is a milquetoast. It ranks second only to &quot;Paranoid&quot; in its originality, and the musicianship may be a little bit better, mixed well enough to show off everyone in the band. It's  also unlike the other classic-era albums in that it's the only one that  won't leave you feeling dirty or depressed after having listened to it.  Listen to &quot;Master of Reality&quot; and you'll wish Sabbath had  recorded those songs a few years later. (Indeed, the version of &quot;Into  the Void&quot; on the &quot;Reunion&quot; disc is far superior to the  original.) But &quot;Vol. 4&quot; is strong enough to have been recorded  yesterday.<br />&quot;Supernaut&quot; is the greatest heavy-metal  interpretation of blues boogie that's ever been recorded. On this song Tony  Iommi made his guitar sound tidal-wave huge, and Butler and Ward lay a  thunderhead foundation. Who cares what the words are? The sound of Ozzy's  voice is more complement than centerpiece. No one has ever cut a decent  cover version of this song, for good reason. It's one of those few that  needs not be touched. &quot;Supernaut&quot; has a powerfully impressive  guitar line and an infectious rhythm. As a 25-year guitar player, I have  sought in vain for another song as impressively led by the six-string  (maybe &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot; is a fair facsimile).<br />&quot;Vol.  4&quot; is so heavy, the uninitiated listener may have a hard time  surviving through &quot;Wheels of Confusion&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow's  Dream,&quot; which provide some of the heaviest guitar lines ever put to  wax. &quot;Changes&quot; is a bizarre ballad, because the studio mix lends  a downright eerie tone to Ozzy's mournful vocals and the backing  strings.<br />When it comes to my favorite single-length Sabbath songs, I veer  back and forth between &quot;Tomorrow's Dream&quot; and  &quot;Snowblind.&quot; Both have unforgettable melodies, breathtaking  guitar lines and meaningful lyrics sung well. The bridge in  &quot;Snowblind&quot; is awesomely dramatic.<br />The rest of the album is  afterglow. Enjoy.
B00004T9UF|5.0|If you love rap, you'll love Eminem's new CD!  This is nothing but top of the line beats!  This CD will make you fall in love with the producer, Dr. DRE.  Look for tracks number:  3,11,16.  THOSE ARE DOPE!
0792844890|5.0|Spaceballs is without a doubt one of the funniest space parodies ever made.  John Candy is hilarious as a &quot;mawg&quot;, half-man, half-dog (&quot;I'm my own best friend&quot;).  Bill Pullman gives a really funny  performance, and even Mel Brooks makes a small cameo as Yogurt, the  all-knowing master of the schwartz.  The real star here though, is Rick  Moranis as &quot;Dark Helmet&quot;, he is just plain fantastic as the evil  lord.  If you have not seen this movie yet you have deprived yourself of a  national treasure.  P.S. best lines in the movie &quot;What's the matter  Col. Sanders, CHICKEN?&quot; and &quot;No sir, I didn't see you playing  with your dolls again.&quot;
6305807086|1.0|I watch too many movies... I've seen plenty of great ones and many more that are just bad. I'm not easy on them either, but I have studied film for long  enough to judge with knowledge. I gave this movie two chances after  seeing how so many loved it. I just wanted to confirm to myself that it  really was  horrible. Yes, it has an interesting premise - but they come a  dime a dozen. The execution of the film was unordinarily poor. The lighting  was so bad  throughout... thinking back on the movie all I visually see is  muted colors in dark, uninteresting surroundings. Is this an intended  effect? I hope not - If  so, it bears no strong relationship with the film  for effect - and is just plain ugly. When there is enough lighting to see -  it is boring... as are the camera  angles. With the easy application of  great computer effects available, why was such a obvious and annoying  technique chosen for portraying vision  through malkovitch? Most film  students generate a higher standard of artistic filming - most television  programs do too for that matter<br />The plot did not make up for the poor and  uninteresting film making. One relationship twist was piled on top of the  other just to keep the movie going.  Suddenly someone becomes a transsexual  - and another can't decide who she loves (diaz or cusak inside malkovitch,  or malkovitch himself), or why  (the money and prestige, did she actually  love any of these characters.. this is never ever explained). Background  for the characters is not very good, nor  are their motives. The humor  occasionally caught me, but generally lacked. I did, however, enjoy some  connectivity between the movie shown through  puppeteering in cusak's  character in various ways... other than that - this is by far one of the  most over rated films in many years. Artsy? It was  aesthetically  unappealing with no more than an unusual premise (not presented in a  positive fashion.)
B00004T9UF|5.0|The nice thing about Eminem is his lyrical topics are different. He's got more imagination than a lot of rappers out there. But what surprises me is that this album is very good and he had a lot to live up to with this one.  Tracks like &quot;Stan&quot; that make you think or his rage let out on  &quot;Kim&quot; are pure heart. Something you don't see from a rapper too  often. It reminds me a lot of my favorite song &quot;Hit Em Up&quot; by  2Pac. You'll find creative and funny lyrics with good production and every  now and then you get an uncut glimpse of heart and soul from this man. I  think it's beautiful. He could be black and still &quot;stand out like a  green hat with an orange bill&quot; with the lyrical topics he presents at  times. ...
0783221487|3.0|Although Dune is confusing and can not compare with Frank Herberts *excellent* book, it is an enjoyable movie, so long as you don't think too much about the movies you watch. If you like to analyze them, this not the  best movie or you, but if you like to be absorbed and experience the movie,  it is ideal. I do recomend the book, however, which is one of the greatest  Science Fiction works available, a classic.
B00004T9UF|4.0|this is a very good cd, the way eminems lyrics flow is near amazing, the only downfall of the cd is the guest appearances. i wanted to hear an entire cd of slim(with the exception of dre, they rock together). other  than the poor skills of the other rappers, i love this cd and would  definatley recomend it.
6305622825|2.0|A real disappointment.<br />Compared to the writing/plot in Thomas Crown  Affair, this was amateurish and suffered from glaring plot failures and  lack of continuity.<br />WARNING: THE FOLLOWING DIVULGES PLOT:  Supposedly,  the FBI has spent years targeting Catherine Zeta Jones to try and catch her  for her thieving ways.  However, the FBI then stands by and watches her  commit two thefts worth $100 MILLION, on the plot theory that they are  waiting to catch her in the act.  What?!  So, $100 million in stolen  property is not enough to arrest her?!  This is so inane and so  intellectually insulting that it spoils the movie.<br />Then, we have the  &quot;big&quot; heist at the end, which is just, well, lame.  The computer  heist is uninteresting, leaving us with the escape.  But this gets  annoying.  First, we see that this multi-billion bank has NO security  guards in the most sensitive part of the entire building (yeah, right).   Then, we watch the escaping theives have a one-half inch steel cable snap  under their weight ?!  Oh please!  That cable could have supported a Ford  Explorer.<br />And the Zeta Jones getaway at the end -- again completely  inane.  We are to believe that the FBI, after years of tracking her, send  the Three Stooges to guard her after she is caught?  &quot;Gee Moe, there  goes our suspect!&quot;  &quot;After her, ya lamebrain, or I'll pulverize  ya.&quot;  &quot;Sorry Larry, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck.&quot;  Wow, who would  have thought that she would try to make a run for it?  And when she does,  the FBI agents just disappear.  Really amateurish writing, again, which  really ruins the movie.<br />Finally, the chemistry between Connery and Zeta  Jones was completely missing.  Again, watch Thomas Crown Affair to see  great writing/directing of passion.  This movie just fizzled when it came  to the love interest.  And, at the end when Zeta Jones is waiting for  Connery at the station, there is an expressionless look on her face - she  could just aseasily have been waiting for an order of pancakes.  Don't  know if this was terrible directing or terrible acting -- in any event it  was BAD.<br />I was really diappointed in this movie, as I am a HUGE fan of  Connery and Zeta Jones.
0783117388|5.0|I just discovered the show awhile back and now I am hooked.
B000002KON|5.0|I first encountered this album through Amazon, and the reviews greatly intrigued me. Having listened to it (&quot;Victoria&quot; about sixty times in a row), I began kicking myself for not having gotten it before. As a  student of history (East Asian, but certainly related to British Imperial  history), the cultural importance of the album was awfully interesting, but  more important, of course, is that it ROCKS!  &quot;Victoria&quot; could  be equally a patriotic hymn to the Widow herself, or a love song for a girl  named Victoria (and it's great dancing music). &quot;Yes, Sir, No,  Sir&quot; is as good a statement of the alleged &quot;good- ol-days&quot;  as you're going to find, and &quot;Shangri-La&quot; and &quot;Arthur&quot;  just about say it all. Interesting listening alongside the Who's &quot;The  Who Sell Out&quot; (1967). This is easily one of the best albums I've ever  heard.
0385486804|5.0|This is the true story of a young man who rejects modern society for the intense quest for true isolation and oneness with nature.  Chris McCandless wandered into the harsh arctic wilderness unprepared and warned, and was  found dead of starvation months later.  Each chapter opens with powerful  quotations from others who have been on this quest, like Thoreau, London,  Muir and Dillard.  This may be today's Walden and not soon forgotten.
B000002L9B|5.0|For many listeners I know, their interest in Prince leapt directly from Purple Rain to Sign of the Times, and, oh yeah, that cool single &quot;Kiss&quot; in between. Well in my opinion &quot;Parade&quot; is one  Prince album I will always play and love, even today (2000). I sure wish  he'd remaster / re-release this with all the b-sides and outtakes. &quot;I  Wonder U&quot; is one of the strangest, most incredible ideas he's  recorded. If &quot;Around The World in a Day&quot; was Beatle-esque,  &quot;Parade&quot; was Pet Sounds meshed with French film soundtracks, and  the result is extraordinary. I'll probably never listen to Purple Rain  again, but Parade will live on.
B000002UTH|5.0|Two words: George Clinton. (producer) Need I say more?
B00000253N|5.0|What to say about Dylan's masterpiece, arguably the finest album of my lifetime?<br />Yes, his mid-60s classics are 'hipper', but this is his creative pinnacle.  The writing reaches unforseen hights of maturity, depth  and soul-searching.  Dylan never used to be this naked, this  honest.<br />Highlights?  Well, all of it really!  &quot;Tangled Up in  Blue&quot;, &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; and the overlooked &quot;Buckets of  Rain&quot; stand out for me, but everyone'll have their own favorites,  usually for personal reasons - it's that kind of record.<br />Lennon gave us  the raw PLASTIC ONO BAND, Townshend the bitter WHO BY NUMBERS, but Dylan's  self-examination is more contemplative and more changeable - sometimes he  sounds resigned, sometimes full of regret, sometimes angry.<br />Anybody who  loves this album HAS to hear the unreleased original album takes too.  Five  of the ten tracks were re-recorded for BOTT at the last minute (the cover  had already been printed up with liner notes making reference to lyrics  that were no longer to be found on the album).  Note: these are NOT the  versions available on THE BOOTLEG SERIES 1-3, you'll have to seek out a  REAL bootleg for all but &quot;You're a Big Girl Now&quot; which is on  BIOGRAPH and is even more wonderful than the version you'll find here  (BIOGRAPH also contains the excellent out-take &quot;Up to Me&quot;).   These tracks, with their lyrical and mood variations give the listener an  even greater insight into Dylan's finest hour.<br />Oh, and for the  dissenters, he really sings well on this too!
B000009ED0|1.0|Remember when the motor city used to produce musicians of note (kiss or Ted Nugent) now Detroit produces white trash like em and em and kid rock, wow I heard Detroit was a dump of a city and looking at what it produces  musically I can say that Detroit is one disgusting place.  This is music to  empty your stomach to.
0790738139|4.0|I have been a fan of Ellroy for many years and was so happy this movie was  made with such heart and glory. All the acting is great. I loved the  recreation of old L.A. In the light of the Rampart scandal, this film is  even more timely.
006092988X|5.0|I first read this book about thirty years ago.  It stands in a class all by itself.  My daughters have read and loved it.  If you are over 12 and under (it doesn't matter--you could be 120) add this book to your  &quot;don't miss&quot;!
0375703764|2.0|Following the hype and my own preference for contemporary American writers I was excited to dive into House of Leaves. Initially it proved to be inventive, and fresh, but these apparent strenghts soon become weaknesses:  The use of footnotes, the  multi-level narrative, and photomontages, are an  elaborate gimmick, rather than something which actually promotes the  narrative. The author is clearly straining for effect--particularly an  intellectual effect. The use of quotes, foreign languages, references to  obscure texts, it all becomes a tdious exercise, something which would  impress a thesis advisor. The actual &quot;story&quot; is in my opinion  rather shabby. A hallway with a 500 foot ceiling? In a word the writer's  grasp greatly exceeds his reach. He is certainly no David Foster Wallace,  though it appears he would like to be. This book screams &quot;look how  smart I am!&quot; There is no charcter development, the premise is silly,  and unconvincing. I admire his ambition, but prefer to have the goods  delivered, as opposed to promised. Readers seeking an antidote to this  unaffecting excess will do well to read George Saunders, or William T  Vollman. Writers more in control of their stylistic devices.
0440219078|5.0|In his so called &quot;utopian&quot; world that has noloce,colors, piverty, or even choices, Jonas, a twelve-year-old boy,is chosen to be the Receiver of Memory. He receives other people's good and bad memories, which allow him to see colors and have feelings. He decides to run away, so he can change the community. He plans a risky scheme to escape from the community. While he is accomplishing his task, he has to face the hardships or winter, a season that his community does not have. When he reaches his destination, a community with love, choices, and family; he realizes how much better this new community is opposed to his old one. After I finished reading this book, I felt that jonas received what he desered because he was not a foolish kid, and he was very brave.  The message that Lowry gives is that nothing is perfect because jonas thought that his world was great, but when he saw the memories, and compared them with his community, he changed his mind. I think that there are a lot of things that happen that way, for example, when you are buying a house, you think this one house is great, but when you see another, you think it is a lot better and choose that one.  From my point of view, this is a very intersting book because it takes place in the future, and the author writes the book from her point of view on what the future would be like. I find the charecters very interesting also; when the the people in the community are given their assignments(their jobs), they are given a bunch of rules to follow, so that basically controls how thet behave. For example, if they are told that they can lie, they lie, and if they are told that the can be rude, they are rude.  If i were Jonas, I would not have taken the job of the Receicer of Memory because you have to go through physical pain.  The conflict in this book is that Jonas wants everyboy to see what he can see and to feel what he can feel. he does not know how to do that a t frist, but then, he decides to run away.He wants to do this because once he is gone from the community, the memories will come back to the other people, so they can experience them.  I give this book a five star rating because it is very well-written, and the plot was well-planned. I couldn't put the book down!
6305807086|3.0|Okay... this movie was very orriginal and weird...   I loved John Malkovich.!   I think his name should be Malcovich in every movie he's in.   Anyway... I think this movie could've been betre if it was more like a  comedy... everyone says it's so funny, but I heard no one laughing in the  theatre.   The only part I laughed at was the part when malkovich goes into  the portal... the movie wasn't too weird for me... it was just done in a  way I didn't like... there was always sad and dramatic music in otherwise  funny parts.   The movie has a sad ending.   Poor Malcovich and Cussack.    John and John were better with short hair... and at the end their lives are  ruined.
B00004SCX6|2.0|I recently bought this cd with the hopes that perhaps it would be better developed and vocally more engaging than her first one. I was very disappointed to say the least. I heard the first single and title track  from the cd &quot;Oops!..I Did it Again&quot; on the radio and couldnt stop  singing to it, so I felt like the whole cd might be a worthwhile buy. I  hoped all the tracks sounded as good as that one, but they didnt. The cd  sounds like a rushed mess, and has synthesziers and tacky beats throughout.  They do most of the covering up when Britneys voice falters or just cant  take the emotion of the song. On her slower ballads, the same holds true.  Her voice is underdeveloped and it sounds too nasal and breathy to sing the  type of song she was trying to achieve.<br />Overall, this cd is once again  for the 12 year old Britney followers or for someone who is liked the sound  of her last album. But if you are looking for any major improvements in  both, voice or song writing...you should look elsewhere. Perhaps her image  is bigger than her talent.
B00003CX5A|4.0|Tim Burton has done it again and created a moody masterpiece. Depp is delightful as the delicate and scarred Icabod and Ricci is deliciously  radiant as young Miss Von Tassel. I enjoyed the beautiful historical  recreations, but be warned. The gore is in effects and many beheading are  depicted. A rewarding experience.
B00000J7J4|1.0|Highly overrated. The only song worth listening to is &quot;Smooth&quot;.  After all the hype, and all the Grammy awards it won, I was expecting much more.  It was a real letdown.
B00000IPAX|2.0|I am from there hometown and I remember when this was genuine band trying to make good music.But in the last 2 or 3 years they seem to be trying  to play up to girls 12 -16.You could see them at Soma  after dude ranch had  been out for a while they were playing too the bubble gum crowd.To all the  kiddies go see a real san diego band like sprung  monkey
038532653X|5.0|How wonderful to find an author with the perception tounderstand that young people are capable of exploring andunderstanding the same concepts that adults like to see in good literature!  Skellig has so many levels of meaning; faith, frienship, family, where do we fit in the grand scope of the universe... Like Louis Sachar's Holes, this novel has woven every story element into a complex, beautifully crafted reading adventure.  It is sometimes dark, mystical, and eerie, but ultimately uplifting.  Sure to become a classic!  A perfect choice for reading groups that include mothers and daughters.
1573226521|4.0|I expected more from The Beach story- and thought-wise, but I can't say that I didn't like it. The narrative just gets you hooked, Garland's style flows and makes you want to read just that one more page. I might even say  now a few words say more than a thousand pictures, he kind of paints  pictures with his words...It's hard to explain.<br />I thought The Beach to be  highly provocative, for some reason, and it wasn't, instead part travel  story, part description of the main character Richard (he's great and  thoroughly interesting, I might add) and yes, part critique on the effect  of mass tourism, albeit differently than I thought.<br />I have to say I liked  reading it, and there were a few things I really loved: the dream sequences  and the ending, which I've heard they've changed in the movie and I really  can't see any point to that. <br />Beautiful, dream-like, horrific, tense,  witty, well-written. I say it's well worth reading, there something magical  to it, and I'm simply forced to buy The Tesseract too.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I took a listen to all the tracks, and I think I actually enjoyed this CD.  I'm not a huge rap/hip-hop fan, but this CD has to be an exception.  I only listened to it because Dido was featured on track #3, Stan.  Anyway,  I've read all the past reviews and everyone is praising &quot;Stan&quot;  and the gorgeous background vocals.  If you are all wondering who it is,  it's Dido.  Please check her out.  Her music is completely different from  Eminem's, but it's still hella tight music.
B000001EYW|5.0|I remember buying the Bee Gees first album a long time ago and I thought that they had incredible catchy songs. Very unique with their own sound. I used to listen to it a lot. Well they still have that unique sound and  present it in a lush, wonderfully rich sounding cd.  All songs on this cd  stand starting with Alone are very well put together and sound great.  Quality never disappears, and it is displayed all throughout this cd.
B000021Y77|5.0|This is one of the coolest movies ever.i would recomend this to all ages
B00004T9UF|5.0|Marshall Mathers is a great piece of work. 'Slim Shady' was really good, but this is even better. It's got some top tracks i.e. 'Stan', 'Kim', 'The real Slim Shady' and many, many more. I  am lost for words, it's hard to  explain how good it is. The album is Shady's style but there is something  about it that I can't quite put my finger on, something that gives his work  an exta umph. This album is the best yet so if you haven't got it I suggest  you go out and buy it NOW, and if I had a choice I would mark it 11 out of  10. EMINEM IS BACK AND EVEN BETTER. It's been well worth waiting for.
B0000024SD|5.0|I have been a big fan of Dylan's for many years.  My dad used to sing it when I was growing up and I rediscovered it when I was a teenager.  I started off with the best of albums and progressed from there.  Bringing It  All Back Home is by far my favorite.  It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)  and It's All Over Now, Baby Blue are, in my opinion, his best songs and Bob  Dylan's 115th Dream is a great song as well.  If you like Dylan you'll love  this album.
158234082X|5.0|This is a hilarious book that is all too true.  I was, until recently, a career switcher who spent several years working the line at some of New York's top two and three-star restuarants (which I will not name). Bourdain  got it down exactly right.  High level cooking is a roughneck trade and not  at all what serious home cooks might expect.  Those readers who doubt the  truth of this book -- or the dangers of ordering fish at a two star  restaurant -- and think it just an exception from the glamorized and  sanitized world of the Food Network are blinding themselves to the truth.  And the truth is, through all of it, that those who stay are insane in a  great way, fanatics who work relentlessly at their craft because there is  simply no other way.
B00004SCX6|4.0|She did it again. This album is yet the best one from Britney.OPPPPPSSSS I did it again shows the more mature side of Miss Spears. From the uptempo songs like Oops... I did it again and Don't go knockin' on my Door all the  way to the soulful ballads like Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know and Dear  Diary. Miss Spears proves that she's not just a teenybopper being put  together, but instead she proves that she is a talented singer. She also  proves that she had grown a lot. And once again this album proves that. And  to top it all she even co wrote a song in this album called Dear Diary and  as a matter of fact I think that she did a really good job with it. And i  give her credit for the one because she proves that she could not only sing  but she can also write her own music. And for me I think that's a good  thing, because what kind of a singer or musician are you if you don't even  know how to write your own music. AND FOR ME THAT'S ONLY A FEW REASONS WHY  THIS ALBUM SHOULD BE A BIG HIT. <br />KRISSY
6305807086|2.0|This film was not funny at all ,it also really was just a bunch of sci-fi bs no real meaning.Also why John Malkovich what was Joe Piscopo on vacation?
B00002Z88D|5.0|This is just an awesome cd, all the songs are great, and some of them sound even better than the studio version.. songs as  Devil's Dance, Memory Remains, Fuel..... Metallica just are showing that they are STILL the best RocK Band, and that they sound even better live. The only  bad thing of this CD is that there are some classic songs missing, that  should have sound awesome with the orchestra, the songs that I think that  are missing are: Unforgiven, Fade to Black, ORION, Creeping Death, The four  horsemen and TO LIVE IS TO DIE, that's the only bad thing of this Cd. And  the two new songs: &quot;NO LEAF CLOVER&quot; and &quot;-Human&quot;, are  just great, the first one is slow, dark and melodic, and the second one is  just a heavy one, but both of them rock. 3 more words: BUY THIS CD.
0140277447|5.0|I really thought this book was very informative.  It really shocked me to see how cruel the Japanese  were towards the Chinese during WW2.  The graphic descriptions on how the Japanese killed and tortured the Chinese  people really came alive in my imagination.  The stories of the people from   American and European countries helping out the Chinese despite the danger  really fascinated me.  As a Chinese, I was really appalled to what  happened, but I don't hate the Japanese, not at all.  This is what can  happen if we exalt a leader of a nation as a god like Japan did with their  emperor (name? ).  Hitler wasn't the only evil  during WW2, The Rape of  Nanking shows us the other evil of the war.  This book is recommended to  those interested in facts about WW2.
158234082X|5.0|As a chef who has sweated her way up through the ranks of this male-dominated profession for the last 20+ years and never set foot in a culinary school, I found this book to be right on the money. It's hilarious  and full of truth. The &quot;reviewer from Texas&quot; has obviously never  worked in a restaurant! (I'll save him my tenderloin ends.) I highly  recommend it to all my friends in the culinary industry.
0787105686|3.0|beautifully written, interesting idea but not as fascinating as Slow Waltz
B000002UZ1|5.0|A more thorough overview of their significant hits from the respective period than the companion Red album, all twenty-eight of the songs included on &quot;1967-1970&quot; (The Blue Album) are rock classics.<br />We're  treated to a generous seven of the eleven tracks from &quot;Magical Mystery  Tour,&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot; is accurately represented as  well.  Another bonus is the faster, more popular version of  &quot;Revolution,&quot; different than what was included on &quot;The White  Album.&quot;<br />From trippy pop (&quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot;  and &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;) to classic rock (&quot;Get Back,&quot;  &quot;Come Together,&quot;) to their all-time epic masterpiece (&quot;A Day  in the Life&quot;), this compilation of the Beatles is virtually without  error.  For baby boomers, a trip down memory lane.  For musicians, a  textbook on composition and production.  For lovers of pop and rock music,  an unbeatable treasure.
6304765231|5.0|&quot;The Crow&quot; is Brandon Lee's best movie of all time. It has action and romance. The movie is tragic, that can only be surpassed by the actual death of it's star. It's dark, but yet, beautifully poetic film with gothic symbolism and a deep storyline. Lee's acting ability really shines in this film, where we can see him pouring out his soul in every scene. We also see his incredible physical abilities when he goes up against T-bird's gang, he truly has great martial arts abilities. &quot;The Crow&quot; will always be remembered as Brandon Lee's greatest movie, thus spawns a birth of a legend. &quot;Buildings burn, people die, but real love is forever.&quot;
B00004SCX6|4.0|I don't understand why people don't have anything nice to say about Britney!  She is a nice person and I love her new CD. It is alot better than her first one.
061317481X|5.0|I thought that &quot;Roadwork&quot; was the best of books Stephen King wrote as Richard Bachman. Apparently, I am alone in this viewpoint. But I think that if you can sympathize with being fed up with the state of the  world and wanting to just give up, but at the same time still have hope,  then you'll appreciate this book. Once again, Stephen King has done a  wonderful job of probing the human mind. This is a book about frustration,  and it screams &quot;you are not alone.&quot; I'd say this is right up  there with &quot;The Green Mile.&quot;
B000002UYZ|5.0|A Greatest Hits compilation by the Beatles...can much more even be said?  Spanning their early, more pop-flavored years, this collection features select chestnuts from their already-near-perfect albums makes for a  listening experience that is virtually without flaw from beginning to  end.<br />Of course, the argument could be made that the discs aren't full  enough; while the compilation was released to mirror the vinyl edition,  omissions like &quot;I Saw Her Standing There,&quot; &quot;Twist and  Shout,&quot; and &quot;If I Fell&quot; are no less obvious.  Jazz albums  are re-released all the time with &quot;bonus&quot; tracks, why couldn't  the folks at Apple have followed suit and given us a more thorough  collection of their early years?<br />Still, with the likes of &quot;A Hard  Day's Night,&quot; &quot;Day Tripper,&quot; &quot;Drive My Car,&quot; and  &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; all on one package, it's hard to object much.   Every song is a classic and you have a near-complete documentation of the  first four years of the greatest rock band ever.  The only way it doesn't  belong in your collection is if you have every Beatles album to begin with.
0425173895|4.0|Christie's &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; leaves you both breathless and puzzled. There is little action to recommend in the middle, so it can be a boring read at certain points. You want so badly to know  WHO. As with all of Christie's mysteries, everyone is a suspect, and if you  don't pay acute attention, you'll miss the clues. The ending was a shocker  for me. I highly recommend this book, despite it's tedious middle.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The cd is great.  Songs like Stan, and Under the Influence are better than anything any rapper could write.  It offends everyone.  It's funny.  Everyone will like It!
B00004T9UF|4.0|Eminem's new cd is awsome. Track number 10 &quot;im Back&quot; is tight. Em makes fun of everybody in this album,You should buy this album for the lyrics alone,but the beats are also phat. A MUST BUY.
6305750750|3.0|I found that Episode I lacked a good plot and catered more to a 6-year-old rather than an adult, which is why I hesitate to recommend the movie to anyone else.  However, because I am an avid Star Wars fan, I have to admit  that I did enjoy watching the movie for the first time.<br />I know one of the  fatal flaws of the movie has been repeatedly stated by other reviewers, but  it can't be said enough: the digital character, Jar Jar Binks, was  horrible.  In short, Jar Jar looked fake, was annoying, and was too  cartoonish.  Although the digital effects that were used for the 'Pod race'  and space battles were impressive, it did not work well for Jar Jar.  A  puppet, like Yoda, would have been better as it looks more real.   Furthermore, Jar Jar was quite annoying: he was hard to understand and  contributed nothing to the plot.  I realize that George Lucas wanted Jar  Jar to be a comic relief character; Lucas had much better success with  C-3PO and R2-D2 in the original Star Wars movie.<br />The whole movie, Jar Jar  included, seemed childish.  The images and dialogue reminded me of a  Saturday morning cartoon.  The attempt at humor was puerile.  Watching the  clumsy Jar Jar trip over himself was not funny.<br />I believe that Lucas's  vision for this movie was to focus on the child (Anakin) leaving his mother  to begin an epic journey.  A better theme would have been to focus on  discipleship.  The relationship between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon had no  substance.  Instead, they appear on-screen as robots with no history  together.  In addition to focusing on the discipleship of Obi-Wan to  Qui-Gon--this could have been contrasted to the relationship between the  discipleship of Darth Maul to Darth Sidious (Maul and Sidious are both  villains in the movie while Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are the good guys).<br />In  the end, however, for the die hard Star Wars fans out there, I have to  recommend this movie.  If for no other reason, because 2 years is a long  time to waitbefore we see Episode II.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD was the best CD i have ever heard. Starts out with PSA 2000 and gets better from there. The Marshal Mathers LP was even better then The Slim Shady LP. All the tracks are great but the best are 2,3,8,16, and 18.
0446525537|5.0|This book is a true love story, not a romance.  It is about two young people finding themselves and each other in the process.  This book shows us that we are to expect the unexpected and that God is the leader of our  lives.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for something uplifting and  spiritual.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears's voice and music seems more mature and grown up then her first one &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;. I guess it's 'cause she's older when she made &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot;. Of course, it's  still mostly the same kind of music and beat to it. &quot;Oops!...I Did It  Again&quot; is probably my favorite song. I like the dilouge she did with  Max Martin during the middle of the song. My older sister told me they were  talking about the 'Heart of the Ocean' from the movie, &quot;Titanic&quot;.  I'm not really sure, but that makes sense when you really listen to it.  Anyway, I also like the songs &quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;Don't Go Knockin'  On My Door&quot;, and &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot;. I like all  the other songs, too. But the ones I mentioned are my favorite. Britney's  voice hasn't really changed all that much, but she sure has gotten more  mature. Her first CD was a fun CD to listen to, but &quot;Oops!...I Did It  Again&quot; is a much more serious CD, I think. If you enjoy listening to  Britney Spears's music, then you'll love her new album!
0425129586|5.0|In my opinion this is most definitely one of Agatha Christie's best works.  The ending is completely a suprise and not at all predicitable.  The whole story is very enthralling and I was unable to put it down.  I love this  book!
B00004T8RK|5.0|In the new pearl jam hit BINAURAL this band proves once again that they can make the best music of the 90's. Powerfull songs as grievence gods' dice or light years give the album the essence of what Pearl jam is!  Its a  great album that will remain in the Hitory of music as one of the best of  Pearl Jam
6305807086|3.0|Another low-fat review by yours truly. A truly weird and amusing film, made better by the fact that the characters plausibly accept the completely weird world they occupy. A puppeteer finds a gateway into John Malkovich's head on the 7.5th floor of his office building? The film deserves an award just for the industrial-strength suspension of belief it achieves. Now, the gist: 1. Acting rocks, uniformly. Whoever did the pupeteering for J. Cusack deserves worldwide fame. Was it special effects or was it real puppets? I don't know, but I REALLY thought the puppets were something special, literally. As metaphor - they work. 2. Plot - whatever you think you know, you're probably right, but it does work, somehow. 3. Special effects / production design / cinematography - Works well. The 7.5th floor set is very amusing (I'm a cubicle-bound trog, so I'm biased). Most noteworthy - the \\"Malkovich in his own head\\" scene. I wake up in a cold sweat just thinking about it. Finally, the key issue - you can take a date or friend to see it. It is weird enough to be interesting, but not weird enough to put off the average multiplex-goer with a reasonable tolerance for something \\"different.\\" Art-house lite, if you will. You can think about this film, or not, and enjoy it either way. In a nutshell - rent it first.
0380730367|5.0|Dennis Lehane has quickly become one of my favorite authors.  His characters (gotta love that gun toting Bubba) and story lines are well developed are simply reach out and grab your attention.  Every books seems  to get progressively better, though no book has been in the least bit bad.   <br />Since I only recently discovered Dennis Lehane (where in the world have  I been?) I was able to go on a reading marathon and work my way through all  of his books in succession.  Now I've come to the end of the rope.  I'm out  of books.  So I'm just counting the days until his next book comes out.  I  can't wait!
B0000065MS|4.0|I loved this the first time that I saw it. It was a suspensful, almost detective-like movie, with George C. Scott trying desperately to figure out who's got the bomb.<br />For me, once I had seen it once and knew who the  bomber was, it was difficult for me to be fully interested while sitting  through it again. <br />That said, the special effects were quite good for an  old movie like this. It is interesting to see a huge airship in action on  the screen. The movie also had a good number of well-established as well as  up-and-coming actors. Finally, the explosion scene at the end was  interesting. Even though it lasted a while, genuine footage of the original  crash in the scene was worth the price of the movie alone. Producer Robert  Wise (of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;) has given us another look at  incidents of pre-WWII times.<br />I wouldn't say that this is historically  accurate, though. Most evidence (both in the 1930's as well as in the  present day) points to static electricity and the airship's highly  flammable outer cover as the culprit. This movie takes the more sensational  option of a bomber. <br />Still, if you haven't seen this, it's worth your  while to watch it once.
1573228214|5.0|My husband read this a while ago and loved it, but said he didn't want me to read it because it nailed the male psyche spot on.  Now I see why.  But this book is also enormously entertaining.
0783225903|5.0|The ultimate anti-utopian film. Imagine &quot;1984&quot; on ecstasy. Buy this film, or the bigger boxed set with extras.  But, GET IT SEE IT. (pant, pant, pant...) Okay, the executive summary: 1. Acting - DeNiro, Palin,  Pryce, Helman, need I say more?  Rocks. 2. Plot - A man who dares to dream  seizes the chance to be a hero and earns his reward. Don't ask any more,  see the film. 3. Directing / special effects / production design / etc -  Amazing, gothic-comic. Gilliam at the top of his game. Executive summary:  Read my reviews of other films.  I never say &quot;buy this now&quot; to  everyone. This is the exception - it is accessible to anyone who has two  grey cells and a neuron or two, but it is far from simplistic. Not a first  date movie, but if your date sees it and hates it, dump them like a hot  brick, for you are dating a soulless, dead thing. Don't read the other  reviews for plot info - buy this DVD and watch it. Seriously - you, you  there, who is thinking &quot;gee, I don't know...&quot; - BUY IT.  Trust  me. It'll open your mind.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Brad Pitt/Edward Norton: two awesomely talented actors (Edward Norton much more multitalented, but Brad Pitt excellent at the kind of supporting role that he was nominated for in 12 Monkeys) teamed up as a match made in  heaven. I read the novel before seeing the movie, and the screenplay  adaption is brilliant, leaving out and/or adding things, and making other  people say certain lines along with mixing around events, excluding the  unneeded and adding the lacking. Amazing cinematography mixed with awesome  CGI sequences that look very real. An atmosphere and feeling only the way  David Fincher could show it (check out Seven and the Game, you'll see his  style). Great editing and SOUND EFFECTS EDITING (Oscar nomination). Now my  problems: Helena Bonham Carter's character was made totally useless in the  movie. You neither hated nor loved her flat &quot;charm&quot; or lack  thereof. Secondly: Even though this movie is &quot;anti commercial&quot;,  there is a ton of product placement (from Krispy Kreme to Starbucks and  White Castle), and it's made very obvious. Third: the twist towards the end  makes hardly any sense in the movie. In the book, it is explained in a way  that makes sense. I say, see the movie, then read the chapter where it  happens. And FINALLY: I believe that, though very unHollywood in style, I  believe that the producers bowed to the cheap Hollywood  &quot;money-making-and-pleasing-more-people&quot; technique. Showing the  movie to a test audience with a couple different endings, telling the  audience to decide which it likes the most. The ending in the book was very  different, while visually beautiful in the movie, it was definitely a  &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; to a unique film.
6305263248|4.0|I loved the way there was no slow motion during the chase scenes. A common  problem with most hollywood car chases is that the action, for some weird  reason, is slowed down. In my opinion this takes away from the feeling of  speed. Ronin dos a great job in that it shows the action as it would appear  to those involved. And for once, a vegetable or fruit stand isn't dumped  over on the sidewalk. I found the twistey plot a little tough to follow in  the first hour, but it all comes together nicely in the end. It's a very  good ending too i might add. Great acting across the board. I thought  Deniro and Reno were very good together. Interesting relationship. I hope  these two get together again real soon.
0792156684|2.0|....  i have to say that anyone giving this movie 5 stars isBLIND to the fact that this movie is just like every hollywoodmovie. a lot of time and effort was put in this, but what about feeling? NONE. it's just eye candy for the guys, and a cheesy, unrealistic love story for the Leo girls to drool and cry over. how can anyone expect to get a film with feeling and real emotion from the guy that directed the Terminator? come on! the acting was ok, but cheesy and over done, and in some cases not done enough. sure i felt tears in my eyes, but that's just because i'm still vulnerable to Hollywood's false emotion.  END
B000021XS0|5.0|I have followed Dream Theater since their debut in 1989 with &quot;Dream and Day Unite.&quot;  This is absolutely the best thing that they have done, and I am anxious to see what they will come up with next.  James  LaBrie is amazing as the most dynamic vocalist I have heard.  John Myung's  riffs on the bass are delightfully dizzying.  John Petrucci successfully  inegrates a multitude of styles into this epic rock opera.  Mike Portnoy -  the next Neil Peart?  Lastly, Jordan Rudess - I was impressed when I heard  the album, but not as awe-stricken as when I saw and heard him at their  opening act in Phoenix.  I cannot listen to just a portion of this album -  doing so is like eating a single potato chip.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This CD is such a grower! You listen to it again and again and instead of getting bored of some of the songs you love them even more! Considering she's British it's annoying I had to order this!  Get this CD you won't  regret it for the best tracks &quot;Here with me&quot; (Roswell High  theme), &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Take my Hand&quot; and many more. She  sounds a bit like Tara Maclean but more Celtic!
0783229526|5.0|By far the very best adaptation of a book ever filmed.(Vonnegut's  Slaughterhouse Five being a close second.) This film was bashed trashed and  ridiculed by every critic in the contry. They were wrong. Terry Gilliam is  the finest director working today. He has taken a classic work of American  literature and made a movie that ACTUALLY RESEBLES the source material!!  Unheard of in Hollywood I know, but Gilliam has always been on the fringe.  No, this film isn't for everyone. It's based on the hazy rememberings of an  eccentric on psychadelic drugs. Thats what it feels like, but it is  supposed to feel that way. Depp and Del Toro are brilliant. Giliiam is in  top form. Read the book, watch the movie. Buy the ticket, take the ride.
0553260111|5.0|Bourne Identity was my first Ludlum book.  I have since read all Ludlum books.  The Bourne series, however, stands out from the rest.  The page turning suspense, the description of the locales, struggles of Bourne  (Webb) make the book stand out.  Don't miss it!
B00004T9UF|5.0|I have nothing else to say other than if you don't got this album and you are a rap fan, you got to get this CD. It is just too funny! 'Kill You' rocks, I laugh every time I hear it,  'Marshall Mathers' is wicked as is  the rest of the CD. 'Kim' and 'Drug Ballad' are my other favorites. He just  rocks 'cause he speaks his mind. you just got to get it. Five out of Five
B00001R3GR|5.0|R.E.M has never made a better CD. Automatic for the People is close but they are two very different kinds of CD's.  Document is a edge driven electric guitar rock classic.  Its music is loud, but not in your face.   What you do find is the kind of CD that may change the way you look at  things. Wth songs like The End of the World as we Know It, Finest Worksong,  The One I Love, and Welcome to the Occupation each and every person will  find there own personal message.  These songs are timeless.  R.E.M's  Document will live forever in the hearts of true rock fans!
B00004T9UF|4.0|Once in awhile an album comes out that is just a must have. This is one of those joints. Eminem has given us an album chock-full of his hilarious lyrics and suberb wordplay. Not to mention the incredible beats laced  mostly by Dr. Dre &amp; Mel Man. Slim's flow can get a little sick at  times, but you learn to just shake it off and continue nodding your head.  True Em fans are used to this. The intro to &quot;Criminal&quot; sets the  record straight for all the new fans. The album's best cuts are  &quot;Remember Me&quot;, Marshall Mathers&quot; &amp; &quot;Stan&quot;. The  whole album hot so, go cop it you will be very pleased.
6305627347|5.0|This movie works for those who have never seen South Park, as well as for those that are avid fans. The humour is of the highest order as everything that can be mocked and abused is. This is first and foremost a musical,  although that should not deter anyone from seeing this. Of particular note  are the well crafted Satan song and the hilarious Shut your face number.  This film has to be seen to be believed as there is nothing that is too  sacred to be laughed at. For fans of the series there are many recognisable  characters, and set pieces. This recieves the highest praise and lets not  forget we see the full face of Kenny....
630575067X|4.0|Movie:<br /> The Phantom Menace is an ok film. I believe that while it is a slight dissapointment, quite juvenile in some aspects, and occasionally fast and off-paced, it's fun to watch, provides a good introduction and opening to the series and can satisfy in a lot of areas for hard-core fans. Especially in the Jedi area. The Jedi are developed wonderfully in this movie. We get to see them before they were reduced to Yoda, Obi-Wan and Luke. We get to see when they were a big part in politics and a large influence in galactic affairs. The ideals of the council, the nature of the apprentice-master relationship and their fighting style. The lightsaber fights are breathtaking.<br /> In other aspects, the movie fails in a few areas. One being the character of Jar-Jar. Jar-Jar seems to be a good idea in concept. However, his execution comes off as exxagerated, annoying and excessive. While he can be occasionally entertaining, he says to much when he shouldn't be saying anything, he says the wrong things and he gets in the way. It's as if you're on a date with Star Wars and Jar-Jar is a third wheel. He is tolerable though and doesn't \\"ruin\\" the movie as many have said.<br /> The second problem is the character of Anakin, but he's not as big of a problem as Jar-Jar. It's mainly Anakin's lines. The piercing, groan-inducing \\"Yippeee!\\" should've been replaced with something like \\"All-right!\\". The line \\"Now THIS is pod-racing\\" should be totally removed. Other than that, Anakin is played rather well. And if you had seen his competition(see below), you'd understand why he was picked.<br /> The third problem is Darth Maul. Darth Maul is saddeningly underdeveloped. We never get a sense of how evil he is. He comes off more as a mere assassin than a trained sith-lord. There's a TV spot series(included in disc 2) in which one is voice-overed by Darth Maul reciting a poem about fear. This poem has more words than Maul's total lines and, I think, shouldve been included in the film somehow. If not, there should've been more scenes in which he talks more and discusses his dark-side ideals. Aside from Maul, Jar-Jar and Anakin, all the other characters are great. Anakin's mother Shmi(Pernilla August)gives the best performance. Amidala(Natalie Portman), the two Jedi(Neeson and McGregor) and Senator Palpatine(Ian McDiarmid) all give notable performances as well.<br /> My final problem is the pacing. Watching this movie is like being repeatedly punched in the gut in good and bad ways. It takes you from shot to shot showing you widespread oohs and aahs at an uneven and occasionally disappointing pace. You'll want to see more of a moment or location but the movie just whisks you away and says \\"HEYLOOKATTHISNOW!NEATHUH?OKMOVINGON!\\"<br /> Aside from these problems, this is a really great movie. It's certainly worthy of the Star Wars name and is loads of fun to see multiple times. The conflict on Naboo and the way it spreads to encompass the characters is a good introduction. Theres a great blooper reel on this disc. To access it, use search mode on your remote and go to title 3. From what I've seen and heard, Episode 2: Attack of the Clones will not have any of Episode 1's problems and will be an incredible film, far surpassing an ok film like The Phantom Menace.<br /> Final Score for movie: 3.5 out of 5<br />Features:<br /> This is George Lucas' first DVD and it was long-anticipated. I can tell you it was worth the wait and certainly worth buying over the VHS version without a doubt.<br />DISC 1: The Movie<br /> Crisp, clear perfection. This movie was filmed digitally so when its recorded digitally, it's absolutly perfect. A far cry from VHS. This movie shares is pristine quality along the lines of seamless digital transfers of Pixar's Toy Story series, A Bug's Life, and Square Pictures' Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. You certainly won't be disappointed with the presentation. Plus, DVD has freeze-frame pausing unlike VHS's skippy jargled pausing. It'scertainly an advantage in this movie for all the visuals you want to stop and soak in every little detail from. With DVD and a transfer this good, it's possible and really fun.<br />Disc 2: Special Features<br /> If you wanted to know all about how this movie was made, Disc two certainly satisfies. \\"The Beginning\\" is a highlight of this disc. A camera crew was given total unrestricted access to the sets and offices that made The Phantom Menace. 600 total hours were filmed. You get one hour of the best footage. It's really great stuff covering all stages of production. No voice overs and no cutting to cast and crew sitting in a room remeniscing. This documentary gives you a fly-on-the-wall kind of experience. You see it all as it happened. Theres tons of featurettes. If you're curious about any little aspect of the film be it design, production, casting, special effects and more, theres a featurette for it. One of which is called \\"3000 Anakins\\"(the one I mentioned above) You can see quite a few of the kids who auditioned for Anakin. When seing the other two finalists, you will know why they picked Anakin, I assure you.<br /> All the trailers and TV-spots are there. The \\"Duel of the Fates\\" music video is great and it contains a few more behind the scenes shots. Movie Posters in more than a dozen languages are included. The production photo gallery is ok. Theres two scenes where you can view storyboards, rough animatics and final shot together or each one alone which is really neat. There's 7 deleted scenes, some of which have been reincorporated into the movie on disc 1. If you watch the documentary, you can find out why certain scenes were cut and a little backround on deleted scenes in general. One of the most impressive parts of this documentary is the breakdown of the cut waterfall scene. When they show you how they made the waterfall itself, its really cool to see. Theres also great additional bloopers (CG ones akin to those from Pixar's movies) at the end of thedeleted scenes documentary. This is one of if not the best special feature discs out there and it might've been worth buying on its own for the same price.<br />Final score for features: 6 out of 5<br />Overall, if you liked Episode 1, you need to buy this DVD. If you kinda liked it, rent it. It's certainly worth seeing even just for the special features.<br />Final score for the DVD release of Star Wars: Episode 1-The Phantom Menace: 4 out of 5
6305609721|5.0|I believe this is the best Star Trek movie ever made, with &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; coming in second. Wonderful directing, acting, story, sound, everything. Put together very well, with good comedy (you didn't know  Leonard could do comedy, did you?) and just enough drama to make the movie  great. Though I admit the storyline is a little farfetched (they really  could only pull that off in the movies), it's highly original and shows off  Nimoy's creative talents as both writer and director.  This movie is great.  Buy it, you'll love it.
B00004S6GL|5.0|I started listening to elliott smith with either/or (thanks to Good Will Hunting and a friend that had a couple of his cd's). After buying Roman Candle, I snatched up XO as soon as it was released. It took me some  listening, but it caught on. I was told that the process would be the same  for Figure 8, however, after the first pass through, I was hooked. In the  elliott scheme of things, this cd is second only to either/or and  definitely worth buying. All in all, a great cd; I highly recommend it.
6305350205|2.0|I am a big trek fan. But this movie was a mistake. I like what Leonard  Nimoy said about it though. In &quot;I AM SPOCK&quot; he basically tells  everybody not to blame Bill Shatner for it, because he believes Bill is a  great director, but that the fault lies in the very weak storyline.  Well  who am I to argue with Leonard Nimoy? This is a very lame storyline if  there ever was one, I won't waste anyone's time running over it. (But I do  agree with the people who said that Bill shouldn't have directed. This was  definatly an ego issue for him.)  I will say that you should go rent this  movie before you buy it. IF you are a die hard trekkie and you find you  must have it just to say you have it, that's fine, but I wouldn't cry in my  cheerioes if I couldn't get it tomorrow. It's really not a very good movie.
B0000024IE|5.0|I neither a connosieur of hip hop, nor am I particularly interested in the genre, but Public Enemy provides manifestos, not albums. The storytelling, whistle-blowing quality offered by teams of songs working in conjunction  with one another (such as the intellectually compelling duo of &quot;Burn  Hollywood Burn&quot; and &quot;Power to the People&quot;) are not to be  listened to, but considered and discussed for their economic, social and  policital content. This is the voice of an underclass calling for democracy  to once and for all put up or shut up. Ideologically, PE's bretheren are  Los Lobos and their clarion call for Chicano liberation from the economic  constraints pulling this ethnic group down, Billy Bragg and his hopeful  view of a global culture freed from the shackles greed makes, and Luis  Mejia Godoy and his songs selling the values of liberation from false  desires and self-respect through love for one another. When and if  &quot;the revolution&quot; comes, I hope all these people will provide the  songs. However, I think &quot;Power to the People&quot; should lead the  way. Public Enemy will be vital tomorrow as it was yesterday, and will  continue to be as long as democracy promises, but fails to deliver. Those  who do not hear the call for interracial harmony are simply not allowing  themselves to listen.
B00003CX59|5.0|I don't care what anyone says this was one goooooood movie.  First, there are good actors all the way through.  Especially the horse!  CUTE!  I loved how the horsemans teeth were filed to points because it made him look  remarkably pirhanna like.  I had an excellent time watching this at the  theatre because it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I thought wimpy  Ichobod was great!  Me n my friends were laughing our heads off!   De-Cap-I-Tate-Ed!  HEE HEE! We were trying so hard to guess the ending but  we were off by a mile.  Overall it's a great movie with wonderful costumes,  GREAT acting and a surprise villain.  It deserves more than 5 stars!
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is by far the best CD that I have ever owned.  Blink 182 not only delivers an outstanding performance but a hilarious one as well.  Enema of the State is ideal for punk rock or even alternative fans.<br />Dumpweed -  Doesn't make a lot of sense, but has a foot-tapping rythm that's real easy  to get into.<br />Don't Leave Me - Pleasant, annoying tune that no one would  mind your singing it out loud.<br />Aliens Exist - This song is one of my  favorites-it has a real punk beat with brilliant lyrics that have that  funny, immature Tom DeLonge ring to them.<br />Going Away to College -  captures the uncertainty and intimidatingness of getting out into the real  world-plus it has some awsome tunes.<br />What's My Age Again? - Exceptional  guitar-playing and extremely funny and absurd words that you would expect  from a fifteen-year-old adolescent.<br />Dysentary Gary - Puts a spiteful  breakup into a fabulous song.<br />Adam's Song - Widely popular and for a good  reason.  Its one of the only songs on this album that forgets immaturity  and goes to a deeper point of troubled teenager's view.<br />All the Small  Things - Annoying tune that you don't mind getting under your skin.<br />The  Party Song - Fast paced, rap-style song that speeds up and slows down while  it leaves your tongue tied.<br />Mutt - My second favorite song on this  album-Tom DeLonge really knows how to croon a story about a shallow,  mislead couple.<br />Wendy Clear - Not one of the funniest or most popular,  but Mark Hoppus's vocals make up for it.<br />Anthem - Awsome display of raw  talent by drummer Travis Barker as he serves up an impressive beat in this  rebellious song of misfits and outcasts.<br />A must-have addition to any punk  rock fan's collection.  If you like anything remotely close to Blink 182,  then you'll love this CD.

0767805712|5.0|Brilliant. <br />This has everything you can expect from a movie: a great plot (that makes you thrill and think about mankind future), great actors, an incredible visual quality (i simply love the colors), a music score that  makes you feel both sorrow and hope.<br />This is one of those very, very rare  movies that i simply love.<br />Be sure to watch it.
B00004SCX6|5.0|You know for all of you people that are out there and say that this new cd from Britney Spears is bad you are totally wrong. I thought that this new album of hers showed a more mature side of her. She showed us a much more  better voice and I think this an alnum worth buying.
B00003CWPR|5.0|This film hit me at more levels than any other film I have ever seen. Lets get out of the way the obvious; this film was shot near flawlessly and is epitomy of how long to carry scenes out and when to cut them short. The  acting, and I may be alone on this one, was surberb. I may take much flack  for putting Cruise in on that list but, in my view he didn't over or under  act his role. Kidman was trasparent in her role and deserved at least an  Oscar nomination.  I have an idea as too why this film instantly turns off  so many. The elitist hierarchal perspective was put forth boldly. This type  of bold presentation may turn away people disgusted by that level of social  status, that is sad for them because they miss much.  The plot is weaves  through a Freudian perspective and induces out nuances in every aspect of  sexuality. The subtle nature of every turning point in the film is breath  taking to watch. The film concludes leaving you anticipatting  more and  leaving to question was Victor Ziglar convincing to you. Lastly I might add  a question, was Cruise's character that much of a threat to people at the  masked party or, as I contend, anyones presence was enough to trigger the  reaction it did, if so, that eludes that those parties were much more  shocking than portrayed and it conveys a last grand cynical viewpoint  Kubrick left us to ponder. Thanks Stanley for all your work.
1577311523|5.0|I have no words to describe how profoundly this book has changed me AND my life.  This book is unbelieveable!.  I was mesmerized by every word ... AWESOME! Whewwwww!
B00000255F|5.0|I bought this CD a couple of years ago when i was in my last year of high school and as i put it on after a long hard day and lay on the floor, I realized that this single album was probably going to be the greatest rock  album that I would ever listen to. It had Everything! I love Jungleland, i  think it's insane to make a record like that..and Born to Run brings out  all the adrenalin in you, Thunderoads is a teenage highway classic and  Meeting across the river reflects his sad poignant, while slightly jazzy  overtones... A classic all in all. I highly recommend it.
6305807086|1.0|What this movie had in imagination, it lacked in character, message and acting. I do not care in the least that Diaz got a supporting nod, the characters - yes, even the typically super Malkovich (if this is the  &quot;real him&quot;, I am suprised at the effeminant mannerisms, frankly)  - sucked.  All the characters appeared drawn, like Barney Rubble. Very  flat, lacking any sense of space, the entire movie seemed small in scope. A  small environment can be an outstading setting for an intimate movie; this  movie lacks any endearing features of intimacy, ultimately keeping the  viwer at arm's length as the characters move from one unbelievable event to  the next, all surrounding the &quot;portal&quot; that leads to Malkovich's  mind.  Although at times zany and creative, set against the dimly lit  soundstage, and with stilted acting, the movie lacks any significant  &quot;punch&quot;. No tension, no caring for the protagonist, no feelings  for the plight of Malkovich as he tries to unravel the mystery, Spike Jonze  has lost the audience on this one. Ironically, the final scene, a small  blonde child by the pool seeing two women together, lends itself to a story  line that is particularly thought-provoking.  But this scene is the finale,  and is never realized fully.  Rent, if you must, but do not buy.  One star.

How you're looking for  just the right music to help you vent your anger -- at your ex-lover, for  how he or she screwed you, and at yourself, for how you screwed up? This is  that music. This is not punk, nor blues, nor grunge. This is catharsis. It  cannot be compared to the Jayhawks or the Counting Crows (good God, no), as  a previous reviewer tried to do. This is a unique band's catchy, loud,  angry rock music. If you like Beggars Banquet-era Stones, or Tim/Let It  Be-era Replacements, this album is for you. If you don't own it, you're  missing out on something special.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I bought this cd while on a week long road trip. The only song I knew from the band was &quot;Karma Police.&quot; This cd has been in my cd player ever since I got home.  Otherworldly is the only way I can think of to describe Thom Yorke's voice, especially on songs like Exit Music (For a  Film) make you feel lost in some alien fog.  Yorke has the amazing ability  to put layer upon layer of meaning on each word until you can almost see it  dripping off each syllable.<br />So much music just gets old.  You listen and  listen until you can't take any more. But this cd goes beyond that.  Like  the most perfectly crafted movie, each time you go through it you get  something new and different out of the experience.  That first listen alone  is worth it...  But the trips this cd can take you on are  worth far more.
0440219078|5.0|This book was awsome! I loved the whole thing.  It really drew me in and i couldn't put it down! I definetly recomend it to both children and adults. The only thing is that it had a terrible cover that didn't suit the book  well.  When I saw the cover, I didn't think I'd like it, but i did.  Don't  judge this great book by it's cover!
0964385619|4.0|My husband and I have read both this book and &quot;Cashflow Quadrant&quot; and found them common sense guides to personal financial freedom.  We have personally followed many of the guidelines presented in  this book for years and are continually surprised by the many numbers of  people we know(both affluent and struggling)who do not and who feel that  being constantly in debt is the &quot;American way-of-life&quot;.  I  suspect that those who didn't care for this book found that it hit a little  too close to home and made them take a good look into the personal  financial mirror.  Granted, there are no finely detailed plans for  investing and income-growth, but this is a great book to start someone on  the track to reviewing their situation and taking the steps necessary to  achieve financial freedom.  I intend to give copies of both books to family  and friends graduating in hopes they can start out on the right financial  foot.
0385493800|5.0|I was really impressed with &quot;The Testament&quot;, reading this right after &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot;.  It was very fantastic reading two in a row that were inspiring and heart-moving.  Great story line and greater  characters that show determination.  I highly recommend this book along  with &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot; as they are both inspirational.  Keep it  up, John!
B00003CWPR|3.0|EYES WIDE SHUT  (1999)  * * 1/2   Kubrick, Kidman and Cruise spent the  better part of a year making a movie with a moral as simple as  &quot;appreciate what you have at home (in this case a wife and kid) and  don't venture out into unknown territory because there's a lot of evil and  misery out there&quot;.   Even with director Kubrick's notorious propensity  for retake after retake, he obviously gave up on getting a convincing  performance out of Cruise as a  physician.  He's as believable as Woody  Allen playing a gladiator.  Still, Kidman is good and Stanley Pollack is  excellent in a supporting role, and if you take the movie as sort of like a  dream it works pretty well.
B00004R997|3.0|The packaging says 75 minutes, the film is 45.  For such a short movie, it sure is expensive.  Maybe its 75 minutes with all the previews they put before the movie even begins.  This is for diehard Disney fans.
6305807086|3.0|BEING JOHN MALKOVICH  * * 1/2  A tough one to rate.  The screenplay is extremely creative but to me it tries to hard to cover too much ground, too many themes.  As entertainment, the first half hour is the funniest stuff  I've seen in a movie in a long time,  but then the unpleasantness of the  characters started getting to me and by the end I had to consider it an  admirable misfire.  John Cusack is excellent.
B000009CEM|4.0|If you love the heaviest of heavy metal and have not heard this album, you do not know what you are missing!  This album is truely awesome.  It all starts off with &quot;Shock&quot;, a heavy, grinding, kickin song, perfect  for waking you up when you feel a little logy.  From there, we have my  personal favorite, &quot;Edgecrusher&quot;, which kind of sounds like a  Korn song, only about ten times better than anything by that band.  From  there, you've got several raging, bone-shattering songs that will blow you  right out of your seat (with a short break from the heaviness on  &quot;Descent&quot;).  Perhaps the most interesting tracks, though, are the  last two, &quot;Resurrection&quot; and &quot;Timelessness&quot;.  &quot;Resurrection&quot; features fast, eighties-rock-type guitar and soft  vocals all the way through.  Very cool.  But, the most surprising of them  all is &quot;Timelessness&quot;, a soft, beautiful song with a string  section.  Yep, great album, almost all the way through (some songs I may  have to listen to a bit to like more).  As you probably already know, this  is a concept album, and the storyline is great, it would make a killer  movie.  This is a bit different from their previous albums, but it's far  from a sellout.  This makes stuff from Korn and Limp Bizkit sound quite  wimpy.  Anyway, this album is very much recommended, I would also recommend  &quot;Demanufacture&quot;, it's probably even better than this (I wanted to  buy it first, but this was the only one they had), but don't get &quot;Soul  of a New Machine&quot; unless you like death metal type stuff.  Oh, and  make sure you get the version of this album that doesn't have  &quot;Cars&quot;, unless somehow you actually like that song.  Well, that's  about it.  Buy this album, it is very heavy and very cool!
B00004TDRD|5.0|This movie is a credit to everyone associated with it, from the stellar  cast of actors and actresses to the direction by Steven Speilberg to the  original story (a novel) and screenwriting by Peter Benchley. This is a  riviting tale superbly told, with excellent cinematography and special  effects, and a scary soundtrack that builds the edge of mystery to a  crescendo each time it musically announces the shark's appearence.<br />The idea for the movie is deceptively simple; a great white shark with a  fond taste for the sweet taste of human flesh is patrolling the water off  Amity Island (read Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard)and terrorizing the  summer tourist population. Inject into this some interesting and novel  subplots regarding a burned-out city cop and unlikely undersung hero, a  brainy, affable but basically misunderstood young marine biologist, and a  wonderfully crusty old mariner turned professional shark fisherman and you  have the recipe for an entertaining rollercoaster ride.<br />This movie is a  modern classic, one with a young Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and the  late  Robert Shaw. Watching their characters interact is an afternoon's  entertainment well deserved, one that is durable and repeatable. It also is  one that translates very well into the DVD mode. One caution; don't view it  anytime before going for your summer vacation. You may really be afraid to  go back into the water!

0140288503|5.0|This is an interesting, disturbing, and captivating book, and one every American interested in how contemporary foreign policy often injects our armed forces into hostile and violent political situations should read. As someone formally involved with the support of military operations, I found  the situation alarming from the beginning, when these men were sent into an  enemy stronghold without proper support and back up. But then, again, when  the American media's approach to the seriousness of the military campaign  is to be out on the beach filming the landing of American amphibious  troops, one recognizes the absurdity of the situation.  From the outset,  this was hardly a straightforward military operation.<br /> Once the  troops are in place and ready to `rock&amp; roll' in the local environment,  however, the multiple mistakes involved both in military assessment and  then in military reaction slowly suck our troops into an increasingly  unpredictable, dangerous and untenable situation. Of course, with  hindsight, it is easy to second-guess the series of experiences and  decisions made that led to sending 100 troopers into the heavily armed  urban morass they became entwined in, but no one could have guessed how  hostile, energetic, or persistent the heavily armed local thugs would be in  prosecuting the battle. Yet it is precisely this possibility that senior  military officers on the scene must anticipate and appreciate, and it is to  their blood-stained hands (and the hands of civilian policy-makers) that we  must look for the deaths of these fine young men.<br /> On the other  hand, given the mistakes made in establishing the rules of engagement, the  single most striking aspect of this tale is that fact that it has been  painted as a military defeat. Yet in more modest and realistic terms, any  military engagement, which results in 18 dead and dozens, wounded  counter-posed with literally hundreds of dead and wounded Somalis hardly  constitutes an unalloyed defeat. Ambushed, surrounded, and attacked with a  level of unsuspected ferocity, these men fought bravely and well, and  inflicted almost unbelievable damage on an opposing force of overwhelming  numbers and firepower.<br />One chief lesson here is that it was the manner  in which the media portrayed the event that led to the subsequent events,  up to and including the decision to pull American troops out of the region.  Yet, anyone familiar with the nature of war understands it is patently  ridiculous to suppose one can conduct serious military operations involving  the outright use of deadly force without suffering loss of life. Pointing  to situations both before and since only demonstrates our luck, the degree  of caution employed, and the likely enforced timidity of our activities.  Certainly the laughable operations recently conducted in the Balkans  provides proof of this absurd idea. Until we once again have people  experienced in the profession of arms manning decision-making positions in  the Executive branch, people who understand the requirements for successful  military operations, until then we will continue to suffer the slings and  arrows of such outrageous fortune.oyed defeat.

6300268470|5.0|This is the movie that got me hooked on John Wayne westerns.  It's a great  movie to watch on lazy or rainy weekend afternoons.  <br />All the cast mesh  so well together that no part stands out above the rest.  Ricky Nelson and  Dean Martin's duet is a great highpoint to the film.  The Duke is his usual  wonderful self as he works to save the day, and Angie Dickinson does a  great job playing an independant woman that won't be told what to do by  him.<br />Lots of great laughs.
0808514628|5.0|There are too many words to discribe this book. Fantastic, superior, genuine, wonderful... it really is a masterpiece! I had to read this book for 7th Grade English Class (3 Chapters a night). Even though this was a  lot to read a night, I truly enjoyed it. This really is a classic book and  almost every adult you talk to will say they read it as a kid. Buy it  today, it is worth the money, you will want to read it again and again.  But, we also are in the process of watching the black &amp; white movie  which is horrible and stops on chapter 36 when the BOOK ends on 56.
6304711905|5.0|This movie ranks in my top ten of favorites.  The cast has your well knowns, such as Kirk Douglas, Val Kilmer (who does a very quotable Doc Holiday), and Dana Delany...but it also has Michael Biehn as Ringo  (Terminator, Aliens), Billy Zane as the actor (Titanic), Powers Boothe (The  Jim Jones Story) along with many other underrated talents.<br />The plot moves  quickly, even though it is fictionalized a bit from the actual happenings  in Tombstone.<br />The DVD doesn't have anything exceptionally special on it  except for the original trailers, but if this movie gets played over and  over like it does in my household, the DVD will definately survive longer  than VHS tape.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD surpasses everything that made The Slim Shady LP great from, Stan to THe Way I Am.  From Criminal to Drug Ballad.  Like others have stated if you expect to get all songs like The Real Slim Shady, this isn't the CD for  you.  The Real Slim Shady is only real commercial song on the CD, which is  most likely why it's on the album.  THe majority of the album is rugged and  to the point.  His lyrics have matured greatly from THe Slim Shady LP and  contains little joking around.  I recommend this to any rap fan.
B00004ST9P|5.0|I really enjoyed this video collection.  It's kicked off with all four videos from Whitney's first album: &quot;You Give Good Love&quot;, &quot;Saving All My Love For You&quot;, &quot;How Will I Know&quot; and  &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot; which Whitney calls her favorite video.   Whitney calls this video collection &quot;the process of her growth&quot;  where &quot;this girl becomes a woman&quot;. The next set includes videos  from her second album: &quot;I Wanna Dance With Somebody&quot;,  &quot;Didn't We Almost Have It All&quot; (my personal favorite video!),  &quot;So Emotional&quot; and &quot;Where Do Broken Hearts Go&quot; which  Whitney says she didn't even want to record but finally did after urging  from Clive Davis.  Good thing she did for it went on to be her 7th #1  single. Next comes a Grammy performance of &quot;One Moment In Time&quot;  and her unforgettable performance of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;.   From her third album she just includes the videos for &quot;I'm Your Baby  Tonight&quot; and &quot;All The Man That I Need&quot;. Next comes some  soundtrack videos.  The only video from The Bodyguard is &quot;I Will  Always Love You&quot; and the only video from The Preachers Wife is  &quot;Step By Step&quot;.  No videos from Waiting To Exhale are on here.  Finally she ends the collection with all the videos from her final album:  &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, &quot;It's Not Right But It's Okay&quot;,  &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; and &quot;I Learned From The Best&quot;.  All in all, it's money well worth spending to get all of these great videos  in one place.  Most of these videos hardly ever air on the music video  channels anymore so it was great fun to see them again.  You get 18 videos  on this collection and you'll enjoy every one of them!
B000001EXB|5.0|I've been hooked on Elton since I heard Bennie &amp; the Jets (20-odd years ago).  I own all of his albums (except maybe one or two of the drug-head duds).  Now that I'm older, I'm quite glad that I can still count  Elton among my all-time favourite artists.  When I was younger, I liked the  rock-ish stuff, but I've mellowed with age.  Elton and his music has too --  I am pleased that he's not  trying to shake his booty as the aging rock  star, but has made the transition gracefully to a place where he can still  display his wonderful singer/songwriter talents and thrill his listeners.   I love (and still listen to his old stuff), but the new material fits in  perfectly with my 40-something listening needs.  I like quieter music now  and Elton's last few albums (Big Picture, Aida, El Dorado, etc.), fit in  perfectly with where I am now.  <br />This is a really good album.  If you go  in expecting the &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; Elton or the &quot;Captain  Fantastic&quot; Elton, you probably won't like it.  But if you go in with  an attitude &quot;let's hear the music for what it's worth&quot; you'll be  in for a pleasant surprise.  It's highly listenable.  My husband &amp; son  are NOT EJ fans and tolerate it when I play EJ's older albums, but they  have no complaint when I put on this and the newer albums (they love El  Dorado!). <br />So, I say, Elton, keep reinventing yourself and exploring  different styles and I'll keep listening and buying your albums!
6305807930|3.0|INFERNO    (Italy - 1980)    Aspect ratio: 1.85:1  Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo    Though prized by many Dario Argento fans as one of the director's major works, INFERNO emerges as a real disappointment. Abandoning the dictates of a cohesive narrative (which distinguished the giallo epics that made his name), Argento relishes the opportunity to strip INFERNO down to the bare essentials: Leigh McCloskey is  an American music student in Rome who returns home to New York to look for his sister (Irene Miracle) who's gone missing in a neo-Gothic apartment building where deadly supernatural forces hold sway.     This 'bare bones' scenario allows Argento to concentrate exclusively on a series of loosely-connected set-pieces, each self-contained and virtually independent of the main thematic framework. For reasons which will delight some and  mystify others, characters react to extraordinary events in completely  unrealistic ways: Miracle discovers a rotting corpse in a hidden room in the basement and fails to contact the police. Likewise, McCloskey is drugged into unconsciousness while searching the building and dismisses the experience as though it were nothing. A ghostly Ania Pieroni turns up in the middle of McCloskey's music class, completely unobserved by anyone else, whispering something unintelligible before drifting away on a gust of supernatural wind. And so on.    With characterisations, plot and - most importantly - drama sacrificed in favor of dream-like set-pieces, it's virtually impossible to get a handle on the proceedings, and for all its  mayhem and visual beauty, it simply lies there and dies there. Perversely, the film's refusal to operate in a conventional narrative manner and to supply concrete answers to most of its mysteries has provided plenty of ammunition for intellectual movie students over the years (Maitland McDonagh provides a good account of INFERNO's subtextual concerns in her book 'Broken Mirrors Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento'). But anyone simply looking for a good story, well told, are best advised to look elsewhere.    But don't despair: When INFERNO works, it sings! There's a genuinely terrifying moment when a supernatural presence makes itself known in the apartment of Eleonora Giorgi, one of  McCloskey's fellow music students - Argento's use of sound and imagery during this sequence is extraordinarily effective, particularly his use of 'Va Pensiero' from Verdi's 'Nabucco' as an aural counterpoint to the on-screen horrors. The subsequent assault on Giorgi and Gabriele Lavia (a helpful neighbor who comforts Giorgi following her hair-raising encounter with a spectral killer at the local library!) is brilliantly ochestrated, and so is the pay-off when McCloskey stumbles on the gruesome aftermath. INFERNO achieves greatness during moments like this, but it can't sustain itself over feature length, and the result is one of Argento's least memorable achievements.
B00004T9UF|3.0|...  the title of the album says it all.  the first album was way better lyrically; funnier and sharper social  commentary.  <br />the beats were way better too.  the new album's sound like  they were all lifted off of a missy elliot cd.<br />maybe after a few more  listens i'll change my mind.  but following the best rap cd of all time, it  just seems like a disappointment.
B00000JCB3|5.0|This CD is great.Fred Durst does great on Break Stuff.
B000023X9W|5.0|I purchase both the CD and DVD.  The DVD is my favorite.  It features Neil ALONE.  No back-up musicians or singers, just pure Neil in the best thing he has done in years.  Both are a \\"must have\\" for any real fan.
B000020617|5.0|Wow. As with their CD, &quot;The Colour and the Shape,&quot; this is an excellent CD.
B0000027F3|5.0|When a band like Priest has something to proove...they proove it, and how! This one is ten tracks of pure unadulterated Heavy Metal Heaven, designed to say \\"We are still the Metal Gods!\\" Believe me with this CD that statement stands unchallenged in my opinion. The band updated the classic Priest sound here, and although few would argue that this band invented SPEED/THRASH metal, they pressed the pedal to the metal on this one. What makes it all work though, unlike \\"Jugulator\\" is the fact that the songs are well crafted and that there is still room for light and shade throughout. Take as case in point the opener \\"Painkiller\\" where you will get lightning pace and a classic banshee vocal from Halford and say \\"Night Crawler\\" which is no speed fest but has a modern darker feel too! It all works on this one, no fillers and the material gells and sounds fresh even now nearly ten years on. Other classic moments are \\"A Touch Of Evil\\" and \\"Leather Rebel\\" although no song should disappoint any Priest fan on this one, in my opinion the most COMPLETE Priest CD since \\"Stained Class.\\" Try not to give the fingered devil sign whilst listening to 'A Touch Of Evil' if you can! Sad to think that this was the end of an era with Rob Halford and the band parting ways soon after this one, because the band was at the top of its game at this time.
0393317552|5.0|The word for this book is awesome.  It challenges the mind and the conscience both in detailing the history of human civilization.  Not many history books do this.  The history in the book is wonderful.  The  scientific element of the book is sometimes difficult to understand, but  with patience the reader will be greatly rewarded!  This book is a must buy  for every student of human history.
B000021XR5|5.0|STP looked as if their fame was dying away with that horrible album they put out in 1996.  But now with a new, softer and more varied album in No 4., they strike back with a cleverness and determination that Pearl Jam  could never accomplish since 10. Only second to Core in awesomeness of  STP's Albums.  Check out those smashing guitars on Down; the melodic Sour  Girl; Peacufel Atlanta;and the grungy MC5.  it took a little while for me  to get into this suprinsingly short record, but its worth the buy and in my  opinion, in the top 3 Albums of 1999 {aLONG WITH Battle of L.A. and Human  Clay}. Now I can't take this album outta my stereo.
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower, is a very honestinterpretation of life in high school through the eyes of a troubledfreshman.  In this book &quot;you&quot; assume the role of a person Charlie has heard someone talk about at school and begins to send letters to this person, which you read.  Through the book you learn about Charlie's problems, and how he recklessly tries to solve them, usually making things worse for himself.  If you've read Catcher In the Rye, and you liked it I totally recommend this book, if not though, I still recommend it just as much.  This book contains all the elements present in a high chool students life which anybody can relate to: love, death, fights, friends, and family.  This book does get rather graphic sometimes but mostly in a comic way.  So if you can handle a book of this caliber, I suggest you get this book!
0394716787|5.0|For anyone who likes Poe, or wants to be introduced to his work, this is the book.  The book does an excellent job of picking Poe's writings to show the breadth and depth of his ability and imagination.  This book  demonstrates that Poe is one of the greatest authors of all time.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Reading some of the reviews of this movie are painful. People who can't take off their &quot;dumb&quot; glasses for long enough to see the poignancy of this movie should go back to high school, or at least take  some interpretation course. The producers of this movie are not GLORIFYING  or HERALDING underage sex and the like; how does one get the idea that they  enjoy these or something? American Beauty is the best movie of 1999, if not  the decade, and is the epitome of a blend of comedy, insight, and  poignance. The reason this movie is either loved or hated yields one simple  explanation; American Beauty holds a mirror in front of most families in  the nation, and some just cannot take this. Annette Bening shined as  Carolyn Burnham, but the set was eclipsed by the utter brilliance of Kevin  Spacey. His dry humor and outlook on life are amazing and unequaled in  film. I believe Birch should have been given more credit for her role as  Jane Burnham as well; she portrayed a teenager so similar to many today.  Sure, many of the characters were strongly stereotyped (Birch, Mena Suvari,  Chris Cooper, Allison Janney), but what movie does not contain these? This  is to get meanings into the &quot;thick-skulled&quot; (but apparently even  stereotypes didn't do for some). This movie deserved every accolade it's  gotten. 5 Stars.
0385484518|5.0|I loved this book, the very essence of it was &quot;be where you are&quot;.  I am studying for my masters degree and one of my lecturers and he highly recomended this book to the class. I was lucky enough to obtain  it and I read this book in two hours.     Yes the story is sad (isn't life)  however the relationship that evolves between Albom and Morrie is something  that few of us ever experience.  <br />I truly empathised with Morrie's  perspective especially &quot;experience the emotion such as envy,  acknowledge it and detach or let it go.  <br />This book is a must read
0062502182|4.0|Santiago fumbles many times through his journey in part because of his innocence and blind trust in the wrong people.  I liked this book very much, though, and  would read it again (since it's an easy read).  No one in their right mind  would use this book as a guide in her/his personal life even though is  seems deeply religious and may seem to hold some lessons in it.  In it I  saw how, like in real life, there are \\"divine coincidences\\" which  give us hints that things are meant to be or that more learning is to come  from a situation, trip, dream or aquaintanceship.  Even though Santiago's  goal seemed to be superficial one, he did learn a lot along the way.   The  journey to his dream/goal made him a stronger, wiser, more experienced  person.  I think this mirrors reality, in that although we may seem to want  something superficial, there is a lesson for us to learn while trying to  attain it. Hence it can even become a spiritual or life changing  experience.  And who knows, he might have helped that woman from the desert to live a new more fulfilling life elsewhere... even if she  does leave him when she realizes that she can be a freer, less dependent  woman outside of her culture/nation.  She did make a good choice in  mesmorizing him so he could get her out of the desert.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is such a brutally honest and funny CD.  I usually don't go for this type of music, but this album GREAT! Every song is good : )
B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural starts off the way all pearl jam fans want their albums to be like with 3 hard core rock songs that blow you away. The song God's Dice is a standout out of the three with Jeff Ament finally writing a good rocking  song.  The album consists of a fw heavy songs and lots of meelow songs.  Each band member had a hand in the writing of the songs with Jeff writing 2  songs and stone writing 3 songs. Mike and Matt wrote music for one song  each and eddie did his usual quota. The album is very good, 5 stars but  comparing it to other albums it is a mix between Vitalogy and No Code,  either hard rock or soft mellow music.  Highlights are Greivance, God's  Dice, Light Years, Insignificance and Of the Girl.  Only downside is the  recording which sounds flat on the heavy songs and could of been better.  But a good album none the less.
B00000DGSN|5.0|This is Deep Purple at their peak.  There is an energy level here that has rarely been matched.  The vibe to this album is just fantastic.  Even Gillan's between song banter is cool. (&quot;Can we have everything louder  than everything else&quot;)<br />Blackmore's performance is jaw-dropping,  especially the solos on &quot;Highway Star&quot; and &quot;Child in  Time&quot;.  And the rest of the band is right there with him.  The  improvisational moments are sheer bliss.  The guitar/vocal interplay on  &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; is worth the price of admission all by  itself.  And Paice proves over and over again that he is the most  underrated drummer in rock.<br />The remastered sound is crisp and clear, and  the bonus tracks and additional liner notes on this version are the icing  on the cake.  The entirety of Deep Purple's output from 1970 to 1973 should  be mandatory for any hard rock fan's collection and this is a great place  to start.
0790739356|2.0|Well, the previous reviewer,I categorically disagree with you: if actions speak louder than words, let's make a mute movie! True, there are moments in the movie (in its first half), when Soldier's terse behaviour arises  pity in the viewer, for this is the man robbed of normal human behaviour,  who can't even name the feelings that rack him. And curse the ones that  created him such. However, when they pictured a flashback into the past  when Soldier kills a child, my sympathy evaporated for good, and no other  cheezy scenes of him saving and holding children could not save him.<br />To  make things even worse, when the &quot;bad gyus&quot; landed on the planet,  I went to &quot;fast forward&quot;: guess who smashed and routed two dozens  of &quot;death machines&quot;, regained support of his demoted comrades and  blasted the whole planet with a nuclear bomb without uttering five words in  a row? If it comes to that, I'd better watch an old copy of Rambo...
B000002L99|4.0|When David Lee Roth quit(or was fired from)Van Halen the call went out for a leadsinger who would be more of a team player,less of a showboat.Eddie and Co. found such a man in Sammy Hagar,ex-lead singer of Montrose.The  ghost of DLR is still present in the humour that is laced through 5150  (police code for the criminally insane.From  the opening shout on GOOD  ENOUGH(&quot;Hello Baby!&quot;)to the background hijincks on INSIDE,this a  band that feel comfortable with the new direction Hagar would take  them.Unfortunately,this humour would shrink slowly over the next  releases,making albums like 0U812,BALANCE and FOR UNLAWFUL CARNAL  KNOWLEDGE(love that title!)pale imitations of 5150.Nevertheless,songs like  WHY CAN'T THIS BE LOVE,DREAMS,and LOVE COMES WALKING IN have become  classics,and deservedly so.Although I prefer the original lineup,there is  no doubt that 5150 is a worthy followup to 1984.
1878424114|5.0|This book is so simple to read, no one can deny its genuine goodness. This is not, however, for those of us out there that assume that simply buying a book will change their lives or make themselves feel better. But this book  is definitely a good start, and a very sound grounding in the art of living  a happy, wholesome life. It teaches us the simple things that many of us  forget in our day to day lives: how not to hurt people, and how not to hurt  ourselves. If you're bored of all these preacher types, then this book is  for you: Deepak Chopra is by no means a preacher, merely a humble teacher,  happy to give you a guiding hand on your journey through life. Enjoy!
B00001OH7Y|5.0|I bought this album when I was 11 years old in 1981 and all I could think was, &quot;What on earth is he saying! &quot; (like in &quot;Ashes To Ashes&quot;...I finally figured out it's &quot;Jap girls in  synthesis..&quot; Chute, I didn't even know that &quot;synthesis&quot; was  a word for another couple of years) This album was a revelation for me:  FINALLY music that had NADA to do with The Commodores or Foreigner. I  couldn't grasp the whole album for several years, but I didn't care. The  energy of &quot;It's No Game (Part 1)&quot; kept my attention bound &amp;  gagged and the clanking back-beat of the pipes in &quot;Scary  Monsters&quot; infected my imprisoned little subconcious with persistant,  creeping   clarity, like an alarm clock in the attic that you can't reach  to shut off. Thank you Mr. Bowie (Jones) for shattering my mind.    This is  truly classic Bowie. HIGHLY recommended!
6305350205|4.0|I am a trekkie fan, so, critics will probably say I am prejudiced for this movie.  True, It was not the best, but it was very good.  It was entertaining as they always are when this cast gets together.  I see it  many times over, and I have added it to my collection.  To make fun of  William Shatner is a terrible thing.  Why don't you try to direct a full  length film and see how you do.  After, it's only fantasy, have a good time  when you see these things instead of picking them apart.  My rating - 4  stars, so there!
B00001OH7X|5.0|So, like every other red blooded little girl who thought people were completely screwed, I was a major Bowie freak in my post formative years. My first boyfriend told me that this IS the Bowie album to have. Of course,  I thought he was totally wrong because everyone knew that &quot;Scary  Monsters&quot; was IT. I finally bought the cd and I must say, MAN!, was he  ever right! &quot;Lodger&quot; leaves no &quot;Bowiesque&quot; musical  style unspoken for. My favorite being &quot;Red Sails&quot;. The dichotomy  of the strength of the lyrics and his gentle, but powerful voice use is  Masterful! And ohhhhh (sigh...) &quot;Look Back In Anger&quot;: I love how  Bowie warped and twisted disco! &quot;Boys...&quot; is so cleverly  sarcastic it's almost convincing and &quot;African...&quot; seems pre-rap,  except with musical body and substance. (Bowie should have a contest to see  who can repeat the chorus to &quot;African...&quot; seven times fast...)  This cd covers the array of his many different musical styles and flavors  with the grace of a coughing angel and the earnest chords of &quot;such a  life I've never known&quot;.  How is that Bowie has always been (with the  exception of &quot;Let's Dance&quot; and &quot;Tonite&quot;) and STILL  REMAINS such an incredilbe musical visionary? This IS the Bowie album to  have. Brilliant.

6305627347|5.0|An incredible post-modern achievement, South Park - Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut manages to seamlessly blend social criticism, fart jokes, Broadway quality musical numbers, and animation both crude and stunning into the  best movie of the past year. Guaranteed to offend almost everyone who is  easily offended, but those are the kind of people who deserve it anyway  aren't they?  For the rest of us, this movie constitutes the best  anti-censorship argument that we've seen and should be required viewing for  all members of Congress, MPAA members, and anyone who wants to blame  &quot;The Media&quot; (or Canada) for all of our children's problems.    <br />If you have not seen this before, I guarantee you will be hysterically  laughing all through it.  And you will not be able to get the songs out of  your head for weeks afterwards.  I still find myself breaking into  &quot;What Would Brian Boitano Do&quot; at odd moments.  Repeated viewings  are rewarded because there are a large number of background jokes which are  easy to miss the first time around.  <br />After having seen this in the  theater, the VHS tape version suffers slightly from the limitations of pan  &amp; scan (who would have thought South Park would need widescreen).  But  this has not cut into my enjoyment of the tape.
B00000IPAX|5.0|FROM THE FIRST BEATS OF THE ALBUM, TO THE LAST SONG, &quot;ANTHEM&quot;, I WAS HOOKED. I STARTED AS YOUR TYPICAL LITTLE BACKSTREET BOYS FAN, THAT IS, UNTIL MY DAD BOUGHT ME THE BLINK 182 ALBUM! YOU WILL ESPECIALLY ENJOY THIS  ALBUM IF YOU ARE A MOODY PERSON, AS THERE IS A SONG FOR EVERY MOOD YOU CAN  FEEL. A TRACK CONSTANTLY ON REPEAT IN MY HOME IS &quot;ADAM'S SONG&quot;,  ABOUT SUICIDE AND DEPRESSION, BUT SOON TURNS INTO &quot;TOMORROW HOLDS SUCH  BETTER DAYS&quot;. BLINK IS AWESOME, AND SO IS &quot;ENEMA OF THE  STATE&quot;!
0790733226|5.0|I went into this movie thinking is was going to all be about space travel, when in fact its about how we as people are all very unique and special, and its time we realize this, and ignore all the petty problems we create  for our selves. This is one of those movies that really makes you think, at  least thats what i got out of it.<br />Aside from the excellent story, this  movie has some very good special effects. There was one scene in particular  where the machine ends up being destroyed. That was a great job, and in  this dvd there is a featurette showing how that whole scene was composited.  I was amazed at how much work and detail go into a scene like that. There  are also many other addons on the dvd which explain other things.
B00004T9UF|5.0|That is all I can say.  This album is by far the greatest rap album ever released.  I was blown away.  Lyrically this album is as strong as anything, if you can get past the swears and mental images conjured up by  the lyrics which are as raw and uncut as anything Wu-Tang ever did you  actually get a message in the songs.  He raps about how parents are to  blame for violent children not him.  He raps about obsessive fans, how now  everybody wants a piece of his fame, and how musically untalented Britney  Spears and N'Sync are.  The beats are unbelieveable and all I can really  say is buy it now.  It is definetly worth it.
6305263248|5.0|I love any movie with car chases, and this has some of the best. Although adding heavy firearms and bazookas helps. The story wasn't anything special, just lots of action, which totally made the movie worth while.
B00004T9UF|5.0|DAMN...when I thought about the CD before I bought it, I thought that it wouldn't be as good as the Slim Shady LP.  So, I was sceptical before buying this.  Then I popped it into my CD player after I bought it and I  was blown away from the first track...it's funny as hell.  And the first  actual song...Kill You...DAMN!  It was sweet as hell!  Then you have the  best conceptual song ever and probably the best song Eminem has ever  done...Stan.  You just feel for Stan and how Eminem is sorry for not  writting to him earlier.  Then there are songs like The Way I Am, I'm Back,  Marshall Mathers, Kim, and Criminal that are great.  The rest of the songs  are good, but the worst song on the CD is Remember Me...it sounds so  bad.<br />This is probably going to earn yet another Grammy on Eminem's shelf  next year...even though he doesn't give a damn about a grammy!
079073639X|4.0|Sphere is a strange movie. Many times I just shrug trying to figure out what is going on, but it really doesn't matter, its still a fun movie to watch. To me it has that Abyss feel to it, and in the end a similar  message, ie: if we don't change our ways we are probably going to destroy  ourselves. If you like sci-fi movies, this wouldn't be a bad one to buy.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The Marshall Mathers LP was very impressive.  If you want to pick up a hip-hop CD to bump in your car or something, this is the thing to pick up.  It has GREAT tracks, almost every single track on the CD is my favorite.   You probably will never want to keep on hitting the &quot;skip track&quot;  button again, heh.. Awesome album!
6304712499|3.0|When i first saw this movie, I thought the special effects were terrific, and it really got me interested into the Spawn character. At that time i would of rated the movie as a five, but after watching the HBO cartoon  series and reading the majority of the comic books, I now think that the  movie wasn't that great, or at least I thought it could of been a lot  better, it really doesn't do the character of Spawn justice.
B00000I0XW|5.0|As a fan of Sarah and of Andrew Lloyd Webber, her former husband, I had no idea how in the world I'd become so crazy for this girl's music overnight. She is my favorite female singer, and this album does give a well known  portrait of the Sarah brightman we'd know so well. Also, for you S.B. fans  out there, an all-new Sarah Brightman album, &quot;La Luna,&quot; is being  released in Europe this month. It will be released in America this autumn,  and I'm definitely going to get it when that time comes.<br />So long!
0783114222|5.0|I am a real fan of anything to do with space so i was drawn to this dvd set. I was born long after the Apollo missions ended, so this is basically the only history lesson i have had of the whole thing. This is pretty much  a documentary but its all acted out as if it were a movie, something which  i wish i would see more of.<br />The series is on 3 dvd's with a forth full of  extras. You learn about everything that went on from the first man in  space, to that last man to walk on the moon. This is one of the best  special interest dvd's I own. Its a must have for any space buff.
B000003N7G|5.0|Many reviews have been written about this CD but I thought I'd throw my two cents in anyway. One word-MASTERPIECE. I was pleased to see that it had been reissued on CD and immediately picked up a copy so I could hear it  anywhere. Not the place to start with &quot;Trane&quot; but absolutely one  of his best.Originally released in 1964 this is a landmark album in that it  is an introspective and reflective conceptual composition. The music is  broken into four parts,  &quot;Acknowdedgement&quot;,  &quot;Resolution&quot;, &quot;Pursuance&quot; and &quot;Psalm&quot;. Each  part has its merits but the key ingrediants are the driving creative  energies each member of the quartet displays. Of course &quot;Trane&quot;  is the main course as he serves up some of the most  inspirational sax work  ever recorded. The divine inspiration is evident throughout the album and  you canot help but feel cleansed and inspired yourself after listening to  &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;. The &quot;Psalm&quot; is my favorite movement  of the album and to hear &quot;Trane&quot; chant is truly remarkable. You  too will be saying &quot;A Love Supreme, A Love Supreme, A Love  Supreme&quot;. This is meditative music that brings you closer to the  Supreme Being thanks to the efforts of &quot;Trane&quot;. Listen to this  anytime you want to be in touch with the your spiritual self and be one  with the universe and it's creator. Zone out but remember how you got here  and your purpose should always give praise as &quot;Trane&quot; did.  Coincidentally John Coltrane's initials are JC, listen to this  inspirational music for the ages and keep in mind what he says on the  original linear notes, ELATION- ELEGANCE- EXALTATION- All from God.
1573227978|5.0|I loved this book because it was refreshing, witty and easy to relate to.  I am a 25 year old with a bachelor's in english lit and I would strongly recommend this to anyone with a similar bio.  I didn't like the Tesseract  as well but we'll have to see what Garland comes up with next.  Read The  Beach!

0694003611|5.0|I cannot put my children to bed without reading this story at least once. The cadence is soothing, they wait for every word, and on first reading they love to end each sentance themselves with a squeal of delight. The  second (or sometimes third or fourth) reading has my children rubbing their  eyes, yawning, and cuddling into their pillows.<br />When I turn off the big  light, and the room is dim, I say &quot;goodnight noises everywhere&quot;  to a pair of children who are comforted, sleepy and content. <br />This book  has magic.
6304913176|5.0|Some people could not take the huge amount of violence and gore that was in this film, but it is more than just that. As Leonard Maltin puts it: &quot;A gung-ho WWII movie transplanted to the future&quot; . This is  exactly what Starship Troopers is. Like in WWII, young people were  encouraged to join the war, and the media made it look like it was a proud  and easy thing to do. This is exactly how it is in the movie. When they  finally get to the surface of a bug planet, they find just how dangerous of  a situation they are in. Exactly like WWII.<br />Yes, the movie is very smart,  but it is also funny and energetic. The battle scenes are awesome, and the  movie is never boring. Buy this movie!
0679746048|2.0|I respect the fact that this is a true story, and you can't deny someone their experiences, but as a read, this book was not all that great!  I'm surprised at all the 4 and 5 star reviews.  At least it was a quick read,  however I did find it a bit dull at times.  It has been years since I read  it, but &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; by Sylvia Plath (also autobiographical)  was a much more intense book about a girl's &quot;descent into  madness&quot;.  If you liked &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, then &quot;The  Bell Jar&quot; would certainly warrant a look.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver is a very exciting and interesting book. It is abouta boy named Jonas who is selected to be the Receiver of Memories. TheGiver has a very important role in Jonas' life because he is the one who gives Jonas all of the memories he has and ever will have. The jobs makes jonas and the Giver the only people who have memories in their community. They are the only people in their community with memories because the memories were giving citizens of the community pain and grief. When that happened, the community made it so only one selected person would have the memories, the pain, and the pleasure. This job is very painstaking, but it pays off. it pays off because Jonas can see in color, and nobody else in the community can. At first, Jonas' community seems like a utopia because there are no accidents, pain, grief, or hunger; but Jonas wants love and feelings to be a part of his everyday life. they aren't part of his everyday life because feelings were taken away with memories. Jonas decides to run off to another community, so he can change his community and give people memories of love, feelings, and choices, so they could lead nomal and happy lives. You see, if the Receiver of Memories leaves the community all of the memories he or she had to go back to the people in the town. I feel this book is very interesting and suspenseful. it is nice and juicy with descriptions, too. I think this story definitly was told from Jonas' point of view. If I were Jonas, I just would have run away as soon as I found out that there were no feelings or choices. The message this book gives me is that we already live in a utopia. This could be true because with every advantage there comes a disadvantage. This way we are living in the Utopia, or it doesn't exsist.
B000002JR8|5.0|First off, it was released on my Birthday! Whoohooo! But anyways, great CD. They experiment a lot in it. If your just ready for fast hitting riffs and kicks, I don't really hear them in it on the first listen. But if you  listen to it a couple of times, you'll get to like it, trust me. Plus it  gets an extra star for just being on my Birthday, that gives it 5!
B000001ZS8|5.0|Jarre was never a critical favourite (in the UK he barely existed, as far as the music press was concerned), and although 'Oxygene', 'Equinoxe', 'Magnetic Fields' and 'Rendezvous' are the albums to start with if you're interested in Jarre's take on spacy synth pop, 'Zoolook' was where he went all experimental. It has Laurie Anderson on it, and is reminiscent of Brian Eno and David Byrne's 'My Life in the Bush of Ghosts', recorded as it was with an early sampler. Indeed the whole album is plastered with samples of voices, and although it sounds very old-fashioned there's a certain primitive early-80s avant garde charm to it. It's a fan favourite, with all that entails; it's hard to get into, and not all of it works, but it's intriguing. Only two of the tracks are conventional pop tunes, and if you don't like 'Ethnicolor' you're going to hate this album.    Musically it is double-plus unlike Jarre's earlier and later work, almost as if the man was channelling the spirits of Talking Heads and Peter Gabriel, and aspects of contemporary American dance music. The title track and 'Zoolookologie' are catchy and fun, the closest he came to funk. The remixed versions presented here were added quite early on in the album's run, and are superior to the generally-similar versions to be found on early LP pressings. They're almost like something by the Tom Tom Club, but with a multi-million franc budget.    Both 'Blah Blah Cafe' and 'Diva' popped up on the previous year's 'Music for Supermarkets', and the latter is presented here with Laurie Anderson performing vocal sounds. The former is again reminiscent of Talking Heads, although it doesn't really go anywhere and suffers as a result ('Diva' has a similar problem; there are two parts, but they don't progress).     'Ethnicolor' is, in contrast, a sombre dirge dotted with random sampled speech, which turns into a quasi-rock number at the end. It's the album's high point and starts off with a particularly memorable screeching noise. As far as I am concerned it's the best of Jarre's prog-esque multi-part longer pieces, quieter and sadder than 'Rendezvous II' from his next album.    'Woolloomooloo' and 'Ethnicolor II' are what would now be called ambient, although only the latter really works, its mixture of found sounds and mournful sampled cellos acting as the perfect finale. The album itself sold poorly and Jarre turned his back on this kind of this; his next release, 'Rendezvous', was slick electronic pop music with an entertainingly Wagnerian symphony taking up most of side one. 'Zoolook' is an aquired taste, and Jarre was clearly never going to be held in the same esteem as Eno or Boulez, but it remains fascinating today, a little relic of early sampling.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've listened too, incredible. It doesn't get much heavier than Sic. Eyeless is a classic along with Wait and Bleed. In Wait and Bleed Cory shows us his singing ability other than his  aggressive screaming, which is very impressive. Surfacing, incredible also.  Spit it out, amazing. Trust me, this CD is great. The only Tracks to be  warned about are probably...1...7...10 and the last one. But still the last  one and 10 along with 7 are listenable. Very good album
B000001ZS5|5.0|'Magnetic Fields' was Jean Michel Jarre's third album, released in 1981 to a familiar mixture of commercial success and critical indifference. It was shorter and poppier than his previous albums, and hasn't aged as well; the phased strings and click-a-brrr-pop beats of 'Oxygene' and 'Equinoxe' now sound charming, whereas 'Fields' just sounds old-fashioned. Although Jarre's electronic production was lusher and more expensive than anything else in 1981 - he was the Industrial Light and Magic to Gary Numan's Stan Winston, if you see what I mean - bits of 'Fields' nonetheless sound very thin and, to be fair, they sounded thin at the time.    The album can be divided into two non-sequential halves. The first half consists of some atmospheric, toe-tapping synth instrumentals - the lengthy, brilliant 'Part I', which is really three very good songs in one, and the shorter 'Part IV', which seems to make reference to Kraftwerk's 'Trans Europe Express' towards the end. The second, lesser half of the album compiles (a) the single, 'Part II', which is extremely catchy but otherwise dreadful, (b) a novelty track, 'Part V', which is catchy but dreadful, and (c) a collection of sound effects, 'Part III', which isn't catchy at all. The album isn't long enough to have room for novelty filler tracks.    There's a noticeable latin beat running throughout 'Magnetic Fields' (although 'Les Chants Magnetiques' actually translates as 'The Magnetic Songs'), and it's a lot bouncier and poppier than 'Oxygene' or 'Equinoxe', whilst the sound is punchier and, as noted elsewhere, cleaner than the sweepy washes of his previous work. 'Fields' is therefore a bit odd in Jarre's pantheon, as he was never really 'synth-pop', despite creating pop music with synthesisers. His next album was a bash at sample-based Talking Heads-esque mid-80s avant-dance pop ('Zoolook') whilst his subsequent albums leaned more towards epic stadium synth-rock, calypso and latterly pale imitations of Air.    So, there you have it. Listen to parts IV and I and you've got a neat, 23-minute EP. As a trivia note, this album contains one of the earliest commercial uses of sampling technology, with a multi-thousand pound Fairlight CMI providing drum samples and vocal effects throughout the album. By the end of the 1980s legions of 'bedroom techno' artists - Bomb the Bass, Altern8, Coldcut and so forth - were storming the charts with Akai machines costing a tenth the price. Jarre himself has become obsolete, as the allure of creating conventional melodic music with synthesisers has evaporated; it remains to be seen how he'll cope with this. Portions of 'Part I' can also be found on 'The Conet project', a compilation of shortwave numbers stations.
B0000028RR|5.0|This IS rage at it's best. If your new to rage and just got Battle of L.A. If you thought that was one of the best CDs you ever heard, you'll be blown away when you listen to this. The CD intervals between Battle of L.A and  the self title album maybe vast, but they still have the same feel and  riffs. THIS IS THE BEST OF RAGE, any real rage fan would agree. If you  don't believe me, get the CD or download some songs and listen, than you'll  agree. Later
B00000J7J4|5.0|So nice to see Carlos on top after so many years.  Now my peers know who Santana is...Carlos has always respected other musicians and loved working with them as well.  Here, he does this and shines!  As do the other  musicians who have a part in this album.  Never before have a seen an album  loved by so many who were not already fans of the performer.  I am so happy  for his success!  And I adore each of the songs on this album.  Simply  wonderful!
B000009QPE|5.0|This is arguably the best death metal album &lt;i&gt; EVER &lt;/i&gt; made. For one thing..I highly doubt this will ever be duplicated, if your any kind of a metal fan or death metal fan, this is a &lt;b&gt; MUST  &lt;/b&gt; for your collection.
0312954468|4.0|I have read quite a lot of books about ancient Egypt, by different authors, and although this one is not always precise on a historical point of view, I find it the most gripping, colourful and adventurous I have  read.  If you're not especially interested in Ancient Egypt but want to  give it a try, this is the one you should pick.      The caracters, the  customs, the colours, the land and everything, are wonderfully described,  you can almost smell the perfumes ...
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This CD by Rage compares to their first one. This CD has to be one of the most thoughtout CDs ever. But I'm still sticking with my guns, the first Rage CD is the best. Don't get me wrong, this is one of the best CDs of the  year. Very much worth the money, and if your too cheap to put the &quot;$18  on the counter&quot; Try E-bay!  LoL &quot;happy Bidding!&quot; Trust me,  worth the money, great CD.
0316777722|5.0|Casual readers of the title of this review will no doubt wonder if Mr. Sedaris was naked in Barrel Fever, perhaps appearing nude in its pages or in the buff while writing it. But those of us who know and love Sedaris  (and recognize &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; as the titles  of his two wonderful books) should rejoice in the release of Me Talk Pretty  One Day.<br />Do not expect an essay on the perils of homosexual love with  Mike Tyson, like the one that graced Barrel Fever. Me Talk Pretty continues  the trajectory begun with Naked. The work is still funny, but it's not side  splitting like Santaland Diaries was; instead, it has the humor of honesty:  these things are funny because they happened, and because they happened to  someone with such a noticable gift for conveying personal tragedy as Mr.  Sedaris.<br />Indeed, Me So Pretty is, if anything, more naked than Naked.  Perhaps you thought that Mr. Sedaris had no more secrets to reveal, no  nooks and crannies of his early personal life left unilluminated after his  1998 autobiography. Me So Pretty proves that, at least for someone as  talented as Mr. Sedaris, there is no end to facets that can be evoked from  one's life.<br />Or the giggles.
B000007T1M|5.0|Wow talk about heavy hitting. These guys and Slipknot, in my opinion, will lead us in the year 2000 for metal. Even though the singing it shorta strange, it still has great lyrics. A great addition for any serious metal,  or heavy metal fan. Even if your not much into metal, I'm still pretty sure  anyone could like this. Well that's my opinion, 5 stars.
0800132335|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I thought it would be justgood. But it turned out to be more, as it was a thrilling, fun, andpowerful movie. It had an explicit anti-war statement, and in some ways, I liked it better than Saving Private Ryan, which had the same powerful message and theme.  Being only 13 and a war buff and military obsessed, I enjoyed this movie  but learned a huge lesson. And that lesson is the fact that there is no  such things as evil soldiers. I mean, the regular German soldier fought for  his country's glory, while the US soldiers fought for protection, good  moral values, and to end the war, which makes them good soldiers. But then  again, the German soldier is only obligated to fight, and with an  oppressive dictator controlling everything down to the people's moral  values, he has no choice but to go along and fight because he was forced  to, not because he wanted to. It also shows that a crew of a German U-boat  is no different from an American crew. While Germans kill because they have  to, Americans kill not because they believe in the war, but because they  believe in helping their country and friends. But both sides are no  different, when it comes down to survival, which they do because they have  to.  The picture quality for the Director's Cut on both DVD and VHS is  spectacular. This film is much more detailed and realistic than other  submarine thrillers. The extra footage makes everything seem even more  real, as it shows everything happenning. And it's just not transitional  scenes, it also all-new sequences! The sound was awesome. When you put on 8  channel SDDS sound on a loud volume, you can hear every drip, creak, and  rustle. Das Boot is a great movie. See it or buy it.
0140177396|5.0|&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a great book.  I never would have touched it, but it was required reading for school.  Not only is it short and brief (only 100 something pages), but it is very insightful and  thought-provoking.  It is hard to place it in a genre, since it very sad,  but also sometimes funny.  So i guess I'll just say it's a good book.  It  does not have the kind of storyline I would actually pick to read, but  after reading it I learned how much I really enjoyed it.  It's really good  to occupy time on a long plane/car ride since of its size, and also pretty  fast-paced, so you can stay interested.  Read this book!
B000001GEM|5.0|KARAJAN Had Always The Style To Explain A Music Thinking, And This BRAHMS  &quot;German Requiem&quot; Is One Of The BEST Vocal&amp;Instumental Peace Played on DG ,So This Interpretation Of KARAJAN Is Amazing ,Glorious  ,Dynamic ,Wonderful, What Do You Want More? The Recording Is Powerful And  Glade To The DG.<br />Plus The Performance Of Jose Van Dam &amp; Barbara  Hendricks is Also Perfect. Of Course Barbara Cannot Be Like Gundula  Janowitz In The Last Version Of Karajan  With The Berliner Philharmoniker  ,this Recording had Taken The Price: &quot;Grand Prix Du Disque&quot;  BUT  This Recording has the same value of the Last Disk with Janowitz. =&gt;A  Nice DISK ,Very Recommended.
1572522232|4.0|This is one of the only films to ever really terrify me.  The film is like a never-ending nightmare you wish you could wake up out of.  The brightly colored scenery and strange lighting add to the creepiness of this film.  The only thing that I didn't particularly care for were the extremely  violent death scenes that, not only looked fake, but made me feel sick.  The music is really creepy and the film altogether was pretty great.  It is  not like any other horror film I've ever seen...When you are watching it,  try to keep an open mind and you should be pleasantly surprised.
B000002J27|5.0|A Trick of the Tail is the boldest and most successful of Genesis's post-Gabriel excursions into long-form composition.  (It's also the first post-Gabriel album.)  This album has it all--funny meters, tempo changes,  weird chord changes, oddball guitar tunings, medleys--all of the hallmarks  of the Gabriel era but set to a different sound. Banks and Hackett stand  out in a way that wasn't possible when Gabriel led the band. The next two  albums (Wind and Wuthering, ...And Then There Were Three) seem to attempt  the same sort of musical storytelling, but come up short. There's not a dud  on this album, and the best tunes (Dance on a Volcano, Squonk, Entangled,  Robbery Assault &amp; Battery) are perfectly executed and intriguing on  many levels.
B000002KE2|2.0|&quot;Vol. 4&quot; is not my favorite Sab release.  It isn't even close.  It runs at least a distant fifteenth with no hope recovering.  I bought this as my third Black Sabbath album; at the time, I wasn't terribly  impressed with much of the material.<br />If you're looking for a more sludgy  and bogged-down release, I don't think even &quot;Born Again&quot; comes  close.  &quot;Wheels of Confusion&quot; and Tommorow's Dream&quot; are  fairly good compilations, but don't even attempt to compare them to  standard fare from the first three albums.  On &quot;Changes,&quot; Ozzy  tries too hard to sound like a burned-out, doped-up lounge singer with a  tinny, irritating, third-rate piano in the background.  It reminds me of  one of those hole-in-the-wall &quot;fancy&quot; restaurants that caters to  the lowest common denominator.<br />&quot;Supernaut&quot; is an average effort  with nothing to endear it to someone like me.  Of all the songs on  &quot;Vol. 4,&quot; &quot;Snowblind&quot; is my favorite, and the only true  classic this album has to offer.  &quot;St. Vitus's Dance&quot; nearly gave  me the disease, which might have been preferable to listening to that  particular song.  &quot;Cornucopia&quot; (out of order, I know) is just  okay; perhaps it is a step or two below &quot;Supernaut.&quot;  Finally,  the album grinds to a stuttering halt with &quot;Under the Song,&quot; the  singularly sludgiest song I have ever had the fortune (misfortune?) of  hearing.<br />This is one release that Tony, Ozzy, and company should have  left in the studio.  I recommend this album only to completists or  masochists.
B000002J23|5.0|If this weren't a &quot;Yes&quot; album I'd still love it. But if it weren't a &quot;Yes&quot; album it would undoubtedly have NEVER BEEN MADE in the decidedly less than experimental era in which it was released.   Drama certainly follows the spirit of Yes even if it doesn't necessarily  follow the sound.  Chris Squire's penchant for perfection was in full swing  by the time Drama came along, but apparently he hadn't yet learned the  not-so-gentle art of overproduction.  Steve Howe plays some of if not his  best technical guitar ever (Machine Messiah!). The brilliant  &quot;Buggles&quot; duo of Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes definitely exerted  an influence on the music, but I prefer to think that they bent their style  to the history and (as I said earlier) spirit of Yes, rather than bending  Yes in their direction. There's not a bad tune on the album, not even a  note out of place. The rhythmic complexity of early Yes is largely gone,  replaced by equivalently complex layers in arrangement and production. But  that was a trend well underway before Drama. If you have to imagine some  name other than &quot;Yes&quot; on the cover to appreciate the music,  please do so. The name doesn't matter.<br />I always find it interesting to  juxtapose &quot;Does It Really Happen&quot; and &quot;It Can Happen to  You.&quot;  Makes one wonder, and those were two of the best songs from  their respective albums.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is everything you could expect from Eminem, this album is much better then his last album &quot;slim shady&quot;, alot of people thing that the seond albums are not that good, but i have both albums and well i  am lost for words, all the songs in his new album are just outstanding. The  best song i think is number 8 &quot;THE REAL SLIM SHADY&quot;, if you like  Eminem you will love this, and if you have never listened to his music  before, you are soooooooo missing out. So go out right now and buy it NOW,  you will not be disapointed.
B000002J1B|5.0|A technical tour de force from Yes with no lapses, Relayer grabs you from the start and drags you, willing or not, through changes of meter and tempo, some of Steve Howe's most precise and yet emotive guitar work, and  some of Jon Anderson's most disciplined and intelligible lyrics.   &quot;Disciplined&quot; isn't a word that applies to many of the best Yes  albums, but it applies to Relayer, which tours musically on a strict  itinerary rather than wandering from theme to theme. Some Yes fans feel  that any version of the band without Bruford and Wakeman isn't the real  thing.  I don't think Alan White does anything beyond the workmanlike on  Relayer, but Pat Moraz, on the other hand, produces his finest work.  To my  ear the change from Wakeman's sloppy grandeur to Moraz's tight rhythms is  welcome.  Yes wouldn't want to be rid of Wakeman forever, of course, but a  break is nice.  Relayer is a very nice break indeed.
B0000025GW|5.0|Fans who have long preferred Dylan's rebellious, folksy lyrics won't be disappointed. In a market which often pushes Christianity to the gospel music genre, Dylan steps up and gives us his best music in years.<br />&quot;I  Believe in You,&quot; is the story of a person who is rejected because of  his faith but doesn't flinch. Dylan hits on a theme universal to anyone who  has believed in something intangible. Autobiographical, he sings about the  public's reaction... they wanted him to sing terribly politically incorrect  lyrics like &quot;just like a woman...&quot; when he wanted to sing about  his new found faith in Christ, equally politically incorrect.<br />&quot;Gotta  Serve Somebody&quot; is witty and insightful, and has a great urban  old-school gospel flavor to it.<br />&quot;Man Gave Names to All the  Animals&quot; is a funny look at what Adam's first job was in Eden.<br />I  fully recommend it.<br />Anthony Trendl
B000002J1S|5.0|But maybe not.  The deepest of the deep yet accessible art rock albums of the 1970s.  Lyrics meticulously constructed from layers of rhyme, meaning, and subtext. Music that is rock, rock opera even, but that demands its own  category.  Peter Gabriel's first truly accomplished vocals, and perhaps  because of his effort and awkwardness, perhaps his most soulful.  Listen.   Think.  Repeat.
0385484518|4.0|I really enjoyed this book because it has a great plot that any young adult can follow.  I do not think that the cursing was very polite to put in a book.
B000002VE7|4.0|Easily one of my favorite Alan Parsons Project albums, Stereotomy has a zero clunker content --something that isn't true of most of the APP albums following I, Robot.  The album is the first by APP to make use of several  new technologies including Yamaha's FM synthesizers (synthesizer buffs will  agree that this album has some of the most tasteful FM work in existence)  and the new generation of digital reverbs. As a result it has a cleaner,  sharper sound than its predecessors.  It also has a more electronic and  synthesizer-oriented character than any other APP album.  I gather that the  record label pretty much abandoned Parson and Woolfson on the marketing for  this slightly out of the mainstream effort.  It lapsed into instant  obscurity as a result, but hopefully the passage of time has revealed it to  more listeners.  &quot;Beaujolais&quot; is my favorite but, as I said, all  of the tunes are decent or better.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theatres right when it came out.  I had trouble finding it because it isn't exactly main-stream.  Finding it though, helped me to see the most stunning movie of 1999.  I make frequent  references to this movie and have come to augment my life accordingly.   Even though a simple animated &quot;cartoon&quot; Princess Mononoke proves  to be true to life.
B000001F29|5.0|It's hard to believe that there is a musical foundation for Jon Anderson that fits better than Yes, but The Friends of Mr. Cairo suggests that such a foundation might exist, and his name would be Vangelis. The real standout  on this album is the extraordinarily melodic and lyrical &quot;Friends of  Mr. Cairo.&quot; Vangelis creates a sonically lush yet notewise spare  framework over which Jon Anderson lays a picture of movies, gangsters, and  sentimentality. Absolutely stunning and worth the price of the album if you  don't listen to anything else. Assuming you do get beyond it, though,  you'll likely hear some other familiar melodies.  &quot;State of  Independence,&quot; for example, whose Donna Summer cover is better known  than the (quite good) original. It can be argued (and I'd be happy to) that  no one has rendered Jon Anderson's ideas into music better than Vangelis,  and it is almost impossible to imagine anyone else singing atop a Vangelis  melody.<br />At least after The Friends of Mr. Cairo it is.
B000002OZY|5.0|Tommy, without question, is the single greatest concept album ever recorded. It's one of the 10 best albums recorded. Period. Pete Townshend announced to the world, with Tommy, that he and The Who were big time  players on the rock and roll scene. You can't look at any concept album  that's been put out since without hearing influences of Tommy. Of  particular note on Tommy are the songs &quot;Acid Queen&quot;,  &quot;Sensation&quot;, and &quot;Sally Simpson&quot;; all convey the  feeling of the album with much more influence than the rock radio standards  &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; and &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot;. Apart  from &quot;Who's Next&quot;, this is the most important album the Bloody  'Ooo ever made.
B000024D4R|5.0|So the lyrics are a bit nihilistic.  After hundreds of listenings over the years that doesn't matter to me.  This is the jazziest, most melodic, most even of all Pink Floyd albums.  You put it on, you listen, you lose track  of time.  If only it were longer.<br />And it's the only album I'm aware of  that contains vocoded dog barks.  (Perhaps you remember hearing Johnny  Fever playing that passage on WKRP!)
B0000024JN|5.0|Perhaps the record that had the biggest impact on me growing up, I still often listen to this CD over ten years later.  I've had many versions, the vinyl, cassette, CD, bootleg CD with the two missing tracks (I'm Down and  The Scenario), and right now i'm on my third CD copy.  When I bought it for  the latest time, the cashier remarked how she too grew up on this CD.  It's  a timeless classic that represents itself well many years after it's  release, even though the Beasties have somewhat distanced themselves from  this record.  It remains their best to date, and one of the best  all-time.<br />And to the misguided reviewer who blasted this record as  &quot;culture Vultures&quot; stealing from the hip hop artform, please  check your ignorance at the door.  No one's comparing the Beasties to  Biggie or Tupac, so that point is invalid.  Should all hiphop sound like  those two, or can hip hop have varying genres and forms within itself?  The  Beasties did what they did best and really did not try to reinvent  themselves as the &quot;blackest whiteboys&quot; out there, unlike Vanilla  Ice.  As a result, they did gain the respect of the hip hop community and  received staying power and longevity as a result.  Your criticism of them  just doesn't wash.
B000002VC5|5.0|The definitive Alan Parsons Project album, and also one of the most popular and enduring sources of television and radio background cues *ever*.  Even if you have no idea who or what Alan Parsons Project is,  you've heard snippets of this album.  The album's use of echo for rhythmic  counterpoint is artful, archetypal, and endlessly imitated.  (It's hard for  me to tell whether David Gilmour of Pink Floyd picked up his habit of  playing against the echo from Alan Parsons in the DSOTM days, or Parsons  picked the technique up from him.  Probably a little of both.)  The  continuous rhythms of the instrumentals with their slowly transforming  ostinato harmonies and atmospheric melodies foreshadow the electronic  instrumentals of the late 1970s (Midnight Express) but even more  significantly, help lay the foundation for a whole genre of dance  electronica coming later in the 1980s and 90s. A classic and a must-have.
B000001FN3|5.0|Tales of Mystery and Imagination is the first &quot;project&quot; by Alan Parsons, the most adventurous, one of the best, and at the time intended to be the only.  With a strong Edgar Allan Poe concept (taking even its title  from Poe), Tales leads you through a first &quot;side&quot; of loosely  connected songs and a second of longer form quasi-orchestral material. The  album as a whole is strong and bears up well under repeated listening.  It  isn't as cohesive as later APP efforts but that isn't necessarily a  fault.<br />As an owner of the original album, I was happy to see it  remastered and re-released on CD (many years ago) but I didn't think that  the remixing and inserted material were an improvement.  The Orson Welles  narrative was fine but the other changes weren't particularly to my liking,  and they still aren't.  Nevertheless, this album remains a progressive rock  landmark, and its boldness and enduring success merit a top rating.<br />My  favorite has always been the spooky, ethereal &quot;The Raven,&quot; which  captures perfectly the metaphysical foreboding of one of Poe's best-known  poems.
B000003S0Z|5.0|One thing you won't find on Before and after Science is a lot of notes.  But you will find a few notes that will have you filling in the blanks with your imagination.  Eno saves the best for last--the Vangelis-like  &quot;Spider and I&quot; with its single verse and repeated chorus, and the  beautiful and lyrically evocative &quot;Julie With...&quot;.  The  subtractive compositional process that removed all the redundant notes  (sometimes including even percussion) leaves music not only free of cliches  and boundaries but that forces you to imagine some much grander.  Listen by  yourself in a darkened room and let your mind wander.
0451450523|5.0|As a child, my sister and I watched this beautiful movie over and over until the colour had faded and the sound was poor, but to this  day my sister watches it still. The characters were unforgettable and the  animation  unique and exquisite. Was I surprised to find that there was a  book, and that it had come first? Yes. I was sceptical at first, but my  reservations melted as I fell in love with Beagle's story. His writing does  my favourite characters more justice than the screen,. His story will take  on new meaning for everyone who reads it and learns to love it. Not just a  silly tale about a unicorn, Beagle's story is witty, daring, fun, and  magical. A timeless book you'll regret not reading... again and again!  There's something for everyone in Beag'es books. And, if you're interested,  there is a history to the animation of The Last Unicorn that is  simplyenchanting. I'm not sorry that I've spent hours of my adult life  watching the movie and reading the book, and neither will you be. Find out  and see! Remember: it is a very rare person who is taken for what he truly  is. Enjoy!
B000002BPS|5.0|So The Offspring, in 1997, tryed to improve on their 8 million-selling 1994 effort, Smash. People say Ixnay On The Hombre couldn't live up to Smash. <br />They were dead wrong. Ixnay On The Hombre is the best CD by The  Offspring, and I think it's because there's more variety. Don't get me  wrong, Smash is another great 5-star CD (And I don't give those easily) but  Ixnay's better. You never hear the same thing.<br />Disclaimer: Guy whose  voice sounds like it belongs in Monty Python explaining how offensive the  record is. Funny too.<br />The Meaning of Life: Pure punk. The kind of stuff  you find on their self-titled album. <br />Mota: The kind of spin-off punk  that make The Offspring so damn good. Shows the life of the junkie.<br />Me  &amp; My Old Lady: Like &quot;Pay The Man&quot; in some respects, filled  with the cynicism The Offspring is known for.<br />Cool To Hate: There are  people like this out there, and Dexter Holland gives us a 100% accurate  impression of what they're like. (I know, people. Believe me, I  know)<br />Leave It Behind: Ugh. This song is like the blemish on the face of  Heather Graham.<br />Gone Away: Offspring songs with pain cannot match any  other. This is one of the best examples.<br />I Choose: I can't think of  another Offspring song that makes you clap your hands. Imagine Blink 182 at  a Moderato tempo and this is it. Not that bad, either.<br />Intermission: You  have to wonder this person's doing at &quot;Intermission.&quot; Taking a  leak? Injecting? We'll never know.<br />All I Want: Short and sweet. Fast and  raging, this song is over before you know it and gives you the feeling you  get when you hear Limp Bizkit's &quot;Break Stuff.&quot;<br />Way Down The  Line: The Offspring's 3rd best song. (I believe the other two are Smash and  The Kids Aren't Alright) Will we end up like our parents? As much as we  hate the thought, we probably will.....<br />Don't Pick It Up: Like &quot;What  Happened To You?&quot; on Smash. Thinkingof dabbling in a little ska, are  we Dexter?<br />Amazed: The Offspring's best slow song. This one triggers  really sad emotions that can only be matched by No Doubt's &quot;Don't  Speak.&quot; <br />Change The World: A great intro on this song.  Ultra-Offspring cynicism on this one. (Wait for a hidden line at the end of  the CD)<br />So, if you've listened to ANY type of punk at all and liked it,  or if you've heard ANYTHING by The Offspring at all and liked it (Except  &quot;Why Don't You Get A Job?&quot;) buy this. If you like No Doubt, Korn,  pre-14:59 Sugar Ray, or Smash Mouth's &quot;Fush Yu Mang&quot; you will  LOVE this and you must buy it immeadiately. <br />I've only given 5-stars to  two other albums, by the way. This one really earned it.
B000002WYT|4.0|Boy, I do love the music on this album.  And when I first heard it on FM radio (Too Much in particular), I eagerly anticipated buying the CD. But when I did acquire it, I found that the mix was extraordinarily mundane.  It was beyond dry--it was lifeless.<br />On FM radio, run through the  station's multiband compressor and with all the flaws hidden by background  noise, it sounds great.  But under headphones in particular, or on any  honest set of near-field speakers, it sounds just ... blah.  Demo albums  sound better.  Heck, even some home studio projects from amateurs sound  better.  The stereo field sounds about three inches wide.  The drums have  no sizzle or kick. Some instruments sound distant and muffled and then a  saxophone appears out of nowhere right in front of your nose.  Ugh.<br />I'm  trying to imagine what Daniel Lanois or even Bob Ezrin could have done with  this album.  I think it would have been a worldbeater.<br />As it is, the  production interferes with my private enjoyment of the otherwise fantastic  composition and performance.  But let me hear it on the radio and it's  &quot;crank it up&quot; time.<br />&quot;Too Much! &quot;
B000006TRV|3.0|Overrated! This is a good album, but I don't think it's as good as most people say it is.  It has some good songs. &quot;Run like hell&quot; is awesome! The trial is unbelievable! I just don't think this is Floyd's best  at all.
B00003CWOL|4.0|Even though I am an unabashedly huge Kevin Smith fan, I still believe this is a very good movie that almost all but the no-sense-of-humor-about-their-religion crowd can enjoy.  Although many saw  this as an attack on Christianity and the Catholic Church, I did not see  that at all.  Taken as it should be, as pure entertainment, this movie uses  the premises of the Bible to set a story about two fallen angels who  believe they have found a way to return to \\"home\\" (heaven), and does so  with humor and humanity.<br />For the first time, Smith is working with a  star-studded cast, and he does a good of making it pay off.  The big names  all provide memorable performances.  In particular, Matt Damon and Ben  Affleck show why they are one of the best movie teams since Newman and  Redford teamed in \\"The Sting\\" and \\"Butch Cassidy\\".  They work well  together, and their conversations as the fallen angels on a mission are  natural and believable.  Salma Hayek is beautiful as always, but also gives  a stellar performance.  Linda Fiorentino, Alan Rickman, Chris Rock, Dave  O'Barr and Jason Lee are all excellent.  But, again, it is Smith himself as  Silent Bob who steals the show.  Silent Bob is one of the funniest  characters the grace the screen in some time.  He does more without  speaking than any actor since Chaplin.<br />The story is convoluted and takes  time to play out, but the payoff is well worth the wait.  There are some  very funny moments throughout the film.<br />As one prior reviewer noted,  some who come to this movie with high expectations are liable to be  disappointed.  But, I will take the chance that the quality of this movie  will triumph, even in the face of high expectations, and give it an  enthusiastic recommendation.  A must for all Smith fans collections, this  movie is very good.  Not quite a full five stars, but a very solid effort  that falls just short of classic status.
B000024D4R|5.0|When I first herd this cd I was amazed! First of all it was a bit different than what I was expecting. It's unquestionably Floyd but it just has a different feel to it than their other albums. But I guess all Floyd  albums do don't they. The songs on this album are just awesome!  I love the  way Roger starts the album off!  Just him and his guitar, playing a very  short very mellow tune.  Then when David comes in for Dogs it just starts  to build. By the time Sheep comes along we have got some serious rock going  on!  And then they bring it back down to end it with the opening song  again. My favorite Floyd album is DSOTM, but I would have to say that  Animals and WYWH are a tie for 2nd. Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS  CD!
0783239955|3.0|Notwithstanding an excellent plot premise and obviously talented actors, the execution of this film veers into territory that may leave many American viewers feeling underwhelmed, and waiting in vain for the  entertainment to begin.<br />Whether or not one likes this film, is a question  of style. Some viewers will be predisposed to enjoy the style of this  restrained, unpretentious French comedy. The Dinner Game is a movie that  may make one smile good-naturedly, rather than laugh histerically. The  comedy arises from the structure and context of a plainly stated plot  premise, not from jokes, or slapstick, or surprise punchlines.<br />Like a  baroque concerto, everything lies in the style and execution of a theme  that is obvious from the very beginning and whose structure harbors no  surprises. This film is a light-footed, seen-it-all-before, unpretentious  study in contrasts between Thierry Lhermitte's character, a stylish and  self-assured rake, and his unsuspecting victim, the bumbling but good  hearted schlub played by Jacques Villeret. <br />All in all, I wish I had seen  this film without the expectations induced by reading the hype on the video  box about La Cage Aux Folles. I probably would have enjoyed The Dinner Game  a tad more if I had stumbled upon it while channel-surfing.<br />WHO MAY LIKE  THIS MOVIE:  viewers who liked Peter Sellers' more understated comedies ...  people who enjoy the idea of a French comedy handled in its native context,  without pandering to Hollywoodisms.<br />WHO MAY NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE:  viewers  who are seeking the next Cage Aux Folles (ignore the innuendo on the video  box) ... people who like their comedy strong, Hollywood-style.
B000002U82|5.0|AWESOME! The best Floyd album!  The best Rock album (after Abby Road) You must buy this!
6304806434|2.0|Con Air is a basic, high-explosion variation on &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. The talented cast is a case of overkill: Con Air character roles call for nothing more sophisticated than caveman-like violence, a' la late night  wrestling.<br />TARGET CROWD: Con Air will probably appeal to people who like  their action flicks loud, explosive, direct, all-American, and  uncomplicated. The good guys win, the bad guys get massively punished in  the end .... and hey, that's it.<br />THIS FILM IS NOT FOR YOU IF:  Avoid Con  Air if you prefer thinking persons' action films, and if you're tired of  formula Hollywood films. This is not a sophisticated movie.

B0000046KM|5.0|This is my favorite of Shirley Horn's albums. Even though I am not a real strings-date-lover, this album immediately captured me. Here is a woman who knows what she is talking/singing about, with her trio as the basis of the  music and not TOO sweetly arranged strings behind her. With definitive  versions of &quot;Estate&quot;, &quot;Wild Is The Wind&quot;: one gem after  another. Her voice has never been recorded better/warmer than this. A must  for every cd collection!
B000023VR6|5.0|What can i say about this album?  For starters i think it is nice to see someone who uses a CD to its full.  In an era of 9 or 10 songs on a CD, it is nice to see an album with 22 songs and actually use most of the 74  minutes availible. The album includes some classic tracks such as  &quot;Still Dre&quot;, &quot;The Watcher&quot; - previewed on Amazon,  &quot;What's the Difference&quot;, etc.<br />There are good beats and tunes  put with good, catchy lyrics for a finished article.  The introduction of  Hittman following the success of Eminem also improves the display.  The  album is supplemented with many guest appearances from top class rap  artists such as Snoop Dogg, Mel-man and the queen of R&amp;B - Mary J.  Blige<br />A good album which is definitely worth the money it's priced at.   Look out for Hittman's new album as well. It's good i can assure you!
B000002BMV|4.0|Perfectly encapsulates the early 80's era of power ballads and sanitized 70's-style rock anthems.  Odds are &quot;Open Arms&quot; was played at your prom, and &quot;Stone in Love&quot; was your favorite all time song EVER  (at least that summer).  Get it and re-live your youth.
0425074811|5.0|Daniken has taken heat from every angle out there, New agers hate him and so do scientists.Why you ask? because this guy saw somthing others didn't he had a theory, one that shook the world at the foundations.Aliens  starting civilization may sound odd at first but we have myth.Myth is a  strong link to our past,we can learn more about real history.Daniken states  that we should revaluate our written history and what could it contain.I  looked to discredit his book as new age garbage but as I read through it I  saw no mention of mana or Karmatic laws just maybe this could  mean....!Daniken turned me on to learning more about history and theology,  subject I thought I had a grasp on.He tackles histories odd balls, like the  pri reis map or the Assyrian lens.And to say that there is any validity to  his idea is academic suicide and labels you an nut who has no grasp on  history.I get that every so often but he gets it everyday labed a fraud  heretic among other things. I loved the book it was easy to understand and  he didn't come off as the know all-be all, just a guy with an idea,an idea  that scares people shakes there beleifs to the core.The evidence against  his book uses conventual thinking, often proven wrong by common sense, if  you know where to look.Daniken is right and others in the scientific  commuinty know it, they are just scared of what could happen to there  Dogma.
B000002BMV|4.0|Brings back all those high school memories for those who long for the golden days of lite metal, hair bands and oblique album covers.  Contains all the necessary Journey hits plus their under-appreciated epic  &quot;Mother, Father&quot;.
B000000WFZ|5.0|This is an exceptional CD with a powerful theme that is carried throughout the whole work. When paired with the movie it is incredible yet just as amazing on it's own! One of my most listened to CDs! Truly great music! You  can't turn this one down! A great CD to relax to.
6305609691|5.0|Many people have described this film as being weird or abstract. To me it seems like one of those \\"truth is stranger than fiction\\" situations, but perhaps that was Coppola's point in making the film. It took an act of genius on Copolla's part to identify the psychological parallels between Conrad's novel \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and the American experience in Vietnam. In both cases, individuals enter an environment in which they discover that their moral code and set of values are irrelevant. And if morality becomes meaningless in one particular place, who is to say that it ever had any meaning at all?<br />Like the novel, the film begins with a mission and a journey. Captain Willard is tacitly ordered to sail up the Mekong river and assasinate an American colonel named Kurtz who has broken away from his chain of command and is conducting the war on his own terms. During the course of the journey Willard researches Kurtz and begins to empathize with him. As Willard's men are slowly killed off, his fear of Kurtz is overshadowed by an overwhelming curiosity toward him. <br />In both the novel and the film, the climax occurs in the form of a revelation rather than dramatic action. After imprisoning and abusing Willard, Kurtz releases him and explains why he has fled to a remote jungle to fight the war on his own terms. Kurtz explains that has a medical officer he and his team inoculated children in a Vietnamese village against polio. Later, they discovered that the Viet Kong had cut of the inoculated arm of every child in the village and left them in a heap. At first, Kurtz wept, but then he came to see \\"the sheer genius of it\\". Kurtz realized that the Viet Kong were human and that of course they did not relish mutilating their own children. But they were willing to perpetrate such cruelty in order to show their enemies the level of ruthlessness with which they would resist them. Kurtz realized at that moment that the Viet Kong offered a moral challenge that the Americans could not possibly meet. This was his apocalypse now. To prove his point, Kurtz fled to the jungle and began fighting the Viet Kong with a comparable degree of horror and ruthlessness. But to the American command, already mired in blindness and illusion, Kurtz was himself a revelation that they could not bear.
B00001NFCY|5.0|This was a good CD, it doesnt have any swearing or bad &quot;messages&quot; for younger listeners. Its also heavy rock for those who just wanna jam.
0679731725|4.0|&quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; is a fascinating study of character, and to some extent of history as well. The novel spans the professional life of an English Butler named Stevens. It guides us from his heyday as a  loyal servant at Darlington Hall to his twilight years as a curio for the  estate's new American owner. Steven's is a man of impeccable loyalty and  stubbornness. While these qualities ensure Stevens' professional survival,  they also provide his life with tragic limitations.<br />In some parts of the  book, Stevens' loyalty is admirable albeit misdirected. For example,  Stevens is unable to acknowledge his father's infirmity until Lord  Darlington brings it to his attention. He is also unable to shed his  professional scales just long enough to have a meaningful interaction with  the woman he loves. At the end of the book, Stevens returns to Darlington  Hall from a short trip to the country and resolves to master the sort of  &quot;bantering&quot; that his American employer requires. All of these  factors make Steven's a humorous caricature, but Ishiguro did not write  this book merely to make fun of English butlers. <br />The real issue lurking  in the depths of this book centers on fascism and conformity. Stevens'  master, Lord Darlington has ties to the British fascist leader Sir Oswald  Mosley, and is later denounced and disgraced for that reason. Blind loyalty  prevents Stevens from acknowledging the error of Lord Darlington's  conviction, even after he fires all the Jewish members of his staff. Long  after Lord Darlington's death, when his estate has been purchased by a  wealthy American, Stevens still feels unquestioning loyalty to the master.  It costs him his relationship with the woman he loves, and makes us rather  pity his blindness.<br />Stevens is in fact the prototypical conformist. His  endless loyalty comes not so much from conviction but from protocol and  habit. It is adaptable and transferable to any form of authority be it a  fascist aristocrat or an American business man. Much like the fascists of  Western Europe, Stevens is still quite useful to have around even when the  old order passes and the new one takes over. Obedient, passionless, and  blind to the injustices around him--Steven's morality is an open standard  that can be retrofitted for any authority.<br />After reading this book, I  recommend that you check out Bernardo Bertolucci's film &quot;Il  Conformist&quot;. Bertolucci explores the same sort of mindset albeit from  a different perspective.
B000002UAC|5.0|This was the first Beatles album I heard and the very first LP I ever bought - back in 1979, at the time of the New Wave explosion in the UK. I remember thinking how this LP didn't sound too far removed from the sounds  and attitudes of the New Wave acts of the time. This is the early Beatles  at their best. Recorded in late 1963 just before their assult on the world  stage this album features a selection of cracking original tunes and some  really good covers of R&amp;B and Rock n Roll stuff. The whole set is  delivered with conviction and bags of raw energy. This is easily the best  of the early Beatles LPs and is actually the only pre-Rubber Soul LP I own  - it's far superior to their first LP and albums like Beatles For Sale and  Help pale in comparison. Although not every song is great most are awesome  and this album is THE definitive 1960s British pop LP (even the cover -  which has been parodied and copied more times than Sgt Pepper!).  Well  worth owning.
006109594X|4.0|I've read this book twice, once for fun and once because I had to read  something related to geography. I found it to be really great both times.  It's very fascinating even though it may not be 100% accurate on some  points. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in submarines or  naval thrillers.
B000023X9W|5.0|Neil Young has crafted a lovely batch of tunes that are quite addictive. Simple, extremely well-performed and achingly personal, it got the immediate attention of my fourteen year-old son who usually balks at  anything I bring home. Musically, this collection brings on smile after  smile. Lyrically, there is only one stumble ('my software's not compatible  with you') on 'Without Rings', but, ironically, Neil slips in a wonderful  turn of phrase on the very next verse(you'll have to get the CD)!
0380002930|5.0|I understand that some may have difrent views on this book.  Yet, all i hear is &quot;it's bunnies, it has no action, the bunny talk is hard to understand, ad infinitum.&quot; We have dumed (if thats a word) down todays  youth by only focasing on action and simple themes.  This book works  because its original.  Lets count shall we?  How many books have humans as  the main charcters? Anyone?  They were all great because they had action  and simple words right? No. Lets face facts, this is a good book because it  shows you things about human nature that you couldn't do with humans as the  main characters.<br />This is a Epic Poem and Hazel is the hero. The stories  within the stories also make it an Epic Poem, and it is the way the trials  and conflicts are set up to show the diffrent types of personalities of the  rabbits. To those who say its dull, read the beginig agin. As the story  starts out it shows adversity from the very begining.  Not just action but  some politics as well. It has factions, cults, and even a mystic element  because of Fiver.  I wish that I had had this book in class.  I would have  loved to have talked about the ideas and themes with others. It's been  years since I read it but I still think about it and try to tell everyone I  know to read it. Don't hate it because there are no humans as the main  characters.
B00004STPT|5.0|There are some soundtracks you like and some you don't. The problem is that when music is written for film purposes, it is sometimes deprived of all listening value. Take, for example, the soundtrack to Jurassic  Park:Lost World, which consisted almost entirely of high, sharp tones that  pained your ears, but perhaps underscored the thrilling movie scenes well.  Ditto for Air Force One.<br /> However, with such examples as Zimmer's The  Rock or Crimson Tide, we hear soundtracks that are not only beautiful, but  also inspiring and grand, prompting you to go back and see the movies  again. Who did not become instantly awed by the power of The Rock's main  theme?<br /> This is the case with Gladiator. You have absolutely nothing to  fear if you doubt that this will be worth listening to over and over again.  You will find several such inspiring themes, suited for battle, shaped for  war. It mixes the really grandiose, heroic themes with energy remniscent of  John Debney's 'Carriage Chase' in Cutthroat Island or Poledouris' Conan. It  also contains quite the contrast, the emotional, melancholic tracks like  'Cora' in Last of the Mohicans, relying heavily on a mystic, otherworldly  vocal by Garrard.<br /> Therefore, you are going to like The Gladiator  Soundtrack.
0894803123|5.0|This book is the best!  <br />It really is hard to believe that such simple recipes can result in such terrific tasting ice cream, but they do!  This is the only ice cream cookbook I'll ever need!  <br />Thank you, Ben and  Jerry!
B00003CWOL|5.0|With the possible exception of &quot;South Park&quot;, this was the funniest movie of 1999.  Wicked in its satire, yet (somehow) managing to remain pro-Catholic, &quot;Dogma&quot; deserved better than it got at the  box office. (Warning, if you are VERY devout, this movie is probably not  for you.)<br />Sharp, well written and well acted, Kevin Smith is starting to  hit his stride as one of the best young writer's/director's/actor's of the  day.<br />On the other hand, Alanis Morissette is a better singer than  actress, even though she has no lines. George Carlin in a role as a bishop  is somewhat wasted after his initial scene (but the casting choice is  brilliant!). But even that can not bring this film down from its top  rating.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I heard of slipknot by a friend at school.  I thought when I looked at the CD it was going to be a bunch of heroin addics sounding like they were singing in a tin can with dog's barking that were acctually people singing... i was wrong.  yes Slipknot is a little hard to understand, but  if your like me you don't really care if the lyrics are good.  The lyrics  are good because i dont care what people think of me, I don't understand  why the world is so messed up, and i don't understand why docters tell u  it's in ur head if it's more then one person seeing/hearing something.  <br />   They do have strong lanuage, in the song Spit it out they swear roughly 12  swears a minute.  Even though, they are a great  band... just because they may look scary don't rule them out... If you like  HARD metal get Slipknot... I suggest listening to the samples first to see  if you like Slipknot... <br />GO SLIPKNOT, KEEP BRINGING A GOOD NAME TO THE  MIDDLE STATES!    GO IOWA AND ILLINOIS!
630242335X|4.0|THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY is the last Star Trek Movie with the entire  original cast, and after WRATH OF KHAN, it is the best action/adventure  Trek movie with our old favorites.  I don't think they could have ended it  better.  In THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY, after a space disaster threaten's the  Klingon's homeworld, Spock convinces a bitter Kirk to escort the Klingon's  Chancellor to a peace talk on Earth, which would end many years of bad  blood between the two nations.  All is going well until the Chancellor's  ship is mysteriously attacked and the Chancellor is killed.  With the  Enterprise to blame for the deed, Kirk and McCoy are arrested and are  sentenced to life imprisonment at a Klingon gulag, and it is up to Spock  and the rest of the crew to uncover the culprits and rescue Kirk and McCoy  before the wrong doers at large can do more harm.  The story is very rich  with twists and turns, the sets, special fx, spaceships and action scenes  are all terrific and look great, I might even add that one of TREK's all  time greatest star fights is in it, with the Enterprise in a torpedo battle  with an invisible starship.  This movie does nothing to disprove a TREK  movie fact, the even numbered ones are the best.  No Trek fan should go  without this one on their shelf, it's great and fun.
B00000K0DT|5.0|Enough praise has been heaped on this movie, that I feel I can focus just on the DVD itself.  (Note: one of my favorite movies of all time).  Specifically, I'd like to praise Bryan Singer and Christoper MacQuarrie for  their director's commentary track.<br />When we got our DVD player last  year, the first DVD I rented was The Usual Suspects.  We watched the movie  all the way through (probably our 10th time seeing this film), and then put  on the movie with the director's commentary soundtrack, thinking we'd see  what it sounded like and watch it later.  Two hours later, we realized that  we had just watched the movie twice in a row.<br />Singer and MacQuarrie  speak in depth about writing this movie, about setting up the shots, about  all the background detail in the movie, about the technical details such as  sound, editing, and film score.  I learned more about filmmaking from  listening to their commentary than I have reading books on the subject.  Since Singer and MacQuarrie are friends and business partners, it was  entertaining to listen to their exchange; it was like getting the inside  scoop from your best friends who happen to be filmmakers.  I was enthralled  the entire time.<br />Since this was the first commentary I'd ever  experienced, I figured it was standard for DVD director's commentaries to  be so thorough, informative, and entertaining.  I was wrong.  I have yet to  find another commentary this interesting, although I've experienced some  awful commentaries (The Matrix) and one that was almost as good (The Prince  of Egypt).  If you love this movie, you HAVE to watch the DVD director's  commentary.
0425129586|5.0|Our 7th grade class had to read &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; for Literature class. My older brother had read it the previous year for the same class, and he said that &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; was a  great book. He and I don't usually read the same type of books, so I  thought I might not like this book. But let me tell you, this book was so  suspenseful, and it really WAS a mystery... it's how a real mystery should  be written. It may seem obvious at who the killer is, and it may seem easy  to predict, but you will be shocked at the ending of the book... I know I  was!
B00000K19E|5.0|I loved the movie, but by now you know that this movie is exciting, fast-paced, with Oscar-winning Special Effects and Sound.  I want to focus, instead on this fully-loaded DVD.<br />The DVD was ALMOST perfect.  I was  happy with all the extras afforded on this DVD: the production notes, the  behind-the-scenes documentaries, the in-depth special effects  documentaries.  However, I was supremely disappointed with the running film  commentary.<br />The commentary was NOT by the Wachowski brothers, but by  supporting star Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), editor Zach Staenberg, and  visual effects supervisor John Gaeta.  I would LOVE to hear what the  Wachowskis have to say about their movie, but on the Matrix DVD, it's all  hearsay as reported by the editor and visual effects supervisor.  That's at  best.  At worst, it's extended periods of silence, and an absent  commentator (Carrie-Anne Moss seems to mysteriously disappear about 1/3 of  the way through the movie).<br />Of course, it's somewhat interesting to  hear about how these people got involved with the movie, but that's not  what I was most hoping to hear about. Perhaps when the trilogy is complete,  the Wachowskis will release a 3-film commentary.  Now that would be  good.<br />Aside from the little problem of the non-director's commentary, I  was more than happy with the other features of the DVD, and am proud to own  this DVD.
067144901X|5.0|My 16 month-old daughter has had this book for three months and she can't get enough of it.  She runs to me, book in hand, saying LA LA LA!  At the beginning, all I had to say is, &quot;Moo, Baa&quot; and she was able to  complete the sentence with LA LA LA.  Now, we're up to &quot;What does the  cow say? What does the sheep say?&quot; and she replies &quot;Moo&quot;,  &quot;Baa&quot;...  The experiences with my daughter have proved that  Sandra's books are great influences on beginning talkers!
0767849493|1.0|I enjoyed Smith's previous movies.  This, however, was the VERY WORST movie I have ever seen.  In my life.  Ever. The dialog was completely redundant (OK, I get the point, Catholocism is rigid and faith is what's  important...), and the story boring and pretentious. Don't waste your time  with this!
B000002H3E|5.0|THE BAND: George Lynch (guitars), Don Dokken (vocals), Jeff Pilson (bass), Mick Brown (drums).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1985) 10 songs clocking in at 42.5 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page booklet with song lyrics, 1 black & white band picture, and thank you's. Recorded at Amigo Studios, North Hollywood, CA. Label - Elektra.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"Under Lock & Key\\" is Dokken at their peak. 10 great songs, cool lyrics, trademark Lynch shredding, unsurpassed Don Dokken vocals. Typical album cover from the mid 80's 'Hair' era - leather and spandex pants, colorful blue/purple/red shirts and blazors, big hair and a gallon of make-up. \\"In My Dreams\\", \\"The Hunter\\", \\"It's Not Love\\" are all great songs - and each made it to their \\"Very Best Of Dokken\\" album released in 1999. \\"Unchain The Night\\" is another gem and a great album opener. 3 of the 4 songs mentioned here also made it their \\"One Night Live\\" (1996) album as well. There are some amazing deep album cuts (\\"Slipping Away\\", \\"Jaded Heart\\", \\"Will The Sun Rise\\") that never got old. Don is harmonizing at his absolute  best. Lynch blisters on guitar (as always). Pilson & Brown are steady and by know means should they be outshined by the 2 leaders of this band (both went onto to be wonderful session players with other well-known rock bands). Even though Dokken was classified as one of those metal hair bands of the 1980's, I think they were much more. Wizard guitar talent, vocally trained, great song writing, craft and appealing melodies - Dokken possessed all the traits. Some will argue \\"Tooth And Nail\\" (1987) may be their best disc, but for song for song if I had to choose one - \\"Under Lock And Key\\" is it. Wondering if Dokken's (early) catalog will get the deluxe digital remastered treatment somewhere in the future... regardless - Great disc.
B00003CXE6|5.0|before i saw gladiator, i had the opportunity of seeing the colosseum in rome, italy... i remember when i saw the colosseum i was amazed on how huge and tall it was... and when we entered the colosseum, it really was an  amazing sight. then about three weeks later, i went to see this movie  gladiator. when i saw the colosseum scenes, i was really amazed to see what  it would of looked back in the acient times... and the whole movie was  great to watch.. russel crowe is an amazing actor and you can definately  see his talent in this movie.. i even hope that he would get an oscar  recognition from gladiator.. even though there were violent scenes that i  found hard to watch, it is an excellent movie.
0440219078|5.0|I loved The Giver, and have it completely memorized because I've read it so many times.  It brings up the continuing theme of &quot;what if there's a problem in paradise?&quot; I think anyone, not just sci-fi or fantasy  readers, would like this book.  The main character, Jonas, has a lot of  depth, and by the end I really felt like I knew him.  This is a definite  buy!
B0000042MY|5.0|If you enjoy soundtracks, then this is a must.  The music is overpowering and diverse.  Each tracks seems to bring something a little diferent than the track before.  The mysterious main title promises the sounds of heroism  and then moves to Elk Hunt, a desperate melody overlapped with a sacred  sound from sweeping strings. From the fiddler ballad of The Kiss, to the  wandering accoustics of The Courier, to the dramatic power of Fort Battle,  Last of the Mohicans delivers.  It has both mood and melody, a combination  that is not always so easy to find. The overall effect of the soundtrack is  also in line with the theme of the movie.  It bears the sounds of the  overpowering naturalism of early woodland America.  This is a well done  composition of soundtrack music.  Get it.

0783222149|5.0|Not perfect, but really entertaining! Streep is excellent and Bacon is  very good.
B00003CWOL|5.0|I thought this movie was incredibly entertaining. I will admit that I thought that Jay and Silent Bob were a little out of place, but they kept a more light and funny side to the movie. The dialog in the film was  enjoyable, and the ending of the film is something not to be missed. Worth  seeing again.
B00003CX7K|5.0|I thought Toy Story 2 was just as good as the first Toy Story!  Tom Hanks  and Tim Allen are just absolutley excellent!  Not only did my children love  it, so did I!!  I already have the first movie, and I can not wait until  the second one comes out!!!  You aren't too old or too young to see this  film!  Keep up the good work, and keep on making great Family movies like  this one!!
B00004SW9R|5.0|There've been various reissues of this album over the years -- Alligator, Repertiore, and now Collector's Choice -- I have no idea how this particular CD edition stands up -- Alligator's was great, Repertiore's  sounded like it was mastered off shoddy worn vinyl and then de-noised to  such an extent that the sound lost nearly all of its booming depths, and  Collector's Choice (though again, I haven't heard this particular version)  have as a label distinguished themselves over the past 7 or 8 years by  allowing cut-rate remastering talent to come in and ruin some of the 1960s  best and most obscure albums (Skip Spence's OAR, the United States of  America album, etc.) -- whatever: forewarned is five-armed. As for the  album itself, I've safeguarded an original ATCO pressing through countless  rent-strikes, burglaries and relocations, and it's one of the few I'd  actually admit into that stupid Desert Island Disc rostrum. It's worth  reading Rebennack's shambling autobiography to get the larger story, but to  wit: a bunch of seasoned New Orleans 50s studio vets, relocated to Los  Angeles after many difficult narcotics travails and incarcerations, take  advantage of (a) their Atlantic/Ertugen Bros. studio connex, and (b) the  ubiquitously gullible hippy thing happening all around them, and come up  with a psychedelic voodoo medicine show which (no matter how much of a joke  some of them may later make it out to be) is far too genuinely steeped in  authenic New Orleans culture and real studio chops to relegate it to the  wastebin destined for so many other 'novelty' acts of the time.  Chinese-water-torture percussion, snake-slick slide guitar, and Dr. John,  the feathered crock-o-the-block himself, chanting fluid paregoric  incantations to astral entities the rest of us wouldn't want to come within  a light-year of. Scary, and late-night, and positively medieval in places.  There have always been certain albums which make evil seem downright fun,  but this seething cauldron is their king.dron is their king.
0790740249|5.0|Sigourney Weaver plays a housebound, phobic and drug addicted forensic psychologist. She has become housebound as a result of a serious threat to her life by a notorious killer.<br />Prior to he becoming disabled, Weaver had  been a highly accomplished forensic psychologist who's speciality was  serial killlers. She had been a national expert on serial killer patterns,  the messages they were sending, and what their general profile might be.  All this has come to a halt as a result of the assault experience and its  aftermath.<br />When a challenging series of new killings break out, local  police reluctantly consult Weaver who makes some inital contact with the  department about her theories. Despite her condition and police wariness,  Weaver proves to be a very important ingredient to solving the crime spree.  <br />Weaver is tied into the world via computer. Her excellent portrayal of a  troubled psychologist and her incredible ability to place the pieces of the  killer puzzle in order, make her the center of this captivating  story.<br />Dermot Mulrooney, Holly Hunter, Harry Connick, Jr., and William  McNamara round out an outstanding cast. <br />This is one to watch over and  over!
B00004T8RK|3.0|Pearl Jam are great, but their music just doesn't come together on Binaural.  Two standout tunes are the frantic &quot;God's Dice&quot; and--saving the best for last--&quot;Fading Away&quot;.  The subtler stuff  sometimes works (&quot;Nothing as it Seems&quot;) but just meanders at  other times (&quot;Light Years&quot;).  &quot;Evacuation&quot; has to be  the most annoying PJ song yet--it's like a stripped-down, more irritating  version of &quot;Do the Evolution&quot;.  I still love PJ--but compared to  their previous efforts, their latest comes off as a collcetion of B-sides.
044022165X|5.0|I saw the movie, listened to the tape and then read the book.  To book was great and the tape would be great for a family on a long trip.  I also like the movie very much. The audio tape holds your attention and would probably  hold the interest of kids 12 and up (for those soon approaching summer car  trips).  The narrator was excellent.<br />This is a great book for people who  want to know what law school is like - the last year and especially for  those students (75%) who aren't one of the top students.  Most people don't  realize how hard it is for the majority of graduates to get good jobs after  finishing law school.  Not only does Grisham write accurately about law  school, his story of the typical lawyer (not the white shoe corporate  types) is also right on target.  Finally, there are so many million dollar  cases that never collect for all kinds of reasons and Grisham really tells  a story of how frustrating being a young, inexperinced lawyer can be at  times.  For all you &quot;learn&quot; in Law School, you know very little  about how law is practiced in the courts everyday.  Armed only with truth  and a just cause, is simply not enough.<br />The book should be required  reading for anyone thinking they want to be a lawyer or to really get an  understanding of what most young average lawyers go through.  It really is  like this!
0792837614|5.0|Though the youngest members of your family will not necessarily get what subtlety exists in this epic romance, and there is much implied violence, this classic musical is an excellent introduction to today's generation the  real heat, talent and creativity behind those GAP commercials...The score  alone remains one of the most memorable and emotionally satisfying Broadway  scores ever; the choreography is a non-stop show of balletic grace, beauty  and violence.  Set in the real streets of New York, this movie has it all:  a Romeo and Juliet love story, featuring the adorable and winning Natalie  Wood, who despite the fact that she is lip-synching to Marnie Nixon's  lovely soprano, does a smashing job in the role of Maria.  Richard Beymer,  who continued to play Tony onstage for many years, is goofily winning as  Tony.  Rita Moreno adds fire and spice in the flashy role of Anita.  Robert  Wise, who would later helm The Sound Of Music, works magic with Jerome  Robbins; the film is gorgeous to look at.  Why oh why oh why can we not  produce a musical of such immediate power and lasting emotion today?  I  truly believe that if the right creative team took the chance on something  as hip and well-drawn as this, people would flock once again to see  musicals on film.  Buy it.
0790729733|5.0|One of the 90's best films is also one of the most important, Oliver Stone shares his views on the JFK assassination and it is nothing short of brilliant. This is an important film that everybody should see at least  once not just for it's subject but also for the way it is made, this is a  film that is like nothing you have ever seen before. This film holds you in  a bearhug of tension throughout the entire 3 hour and 8 minute running  time. I recommend that everybody sees this movie, you will never forget it.
B00000JTB2|5.0|This cd really is priceless.  When if first came out I took my time getting it, I figured if it was really that good we'd have heard about it before now, and it was only being released to cash in on the SRV legacy.   As a long time fan of both musicians I felt like I'd probably heard their  best stuff, why waste money on something that would probably be a big  disappointment?  Yeah, I was an idiot.<br />After listening to it I realized  it may well be one of Stevie's best performances, and Albert's as well.  I  mean, who's been keeping this thing under their hat all these years?  Makes  you wonder what else is out there collecting dust on some clueless record  exec's closet shelf.<br />This is unequivocally Albert's show all the way.  He  does allow Stevie to do one of his own songs (Pride &amp; Joy, Stevie's  only vocal performance) but every other number was straight off of Albert's  regular set list.  This put Stevie in the rare role of backup guitarist,  and consequently produces some of his most tasteful playing ever.  When he  does cut loose, usually at Albert's urging, it's all the more powerful and  moving as a result.<br />Albert, on the other hand, seems determined to prove  he can still keep up with the young phenom and accordingly stretches  himself further than usual, even playing some rhythm here and there during  a few of Stevie's leads.  \\"Blues At Sunrise\\" is by far my favorite, this 15  minute slow blues jam gives both guitarists ample time to show their best  stuff.  This is the point on the cd where I could finally sense Albert's  respect and awe of his young protégé.  Truly a classic recording.
0140288503|5.0|I read Black Hawk Down after a friend recommended it to me, and said that I would love it and in fact I did!  Black Hawk Down is an incredible story of the war in Somalia, and how a group of soldiers orders were to capture a  Somalian clan (Habr Gidr) and imprison its leader.  The story tells of how  heroic rescues were made, how soldiers died for their country, how things  went un-according to plans while trying to capture a Somolian clan leader.  I am a big army fanatic,(Even though i'm 14) and i loved this book so much!   And I recommend this book to anyone who likes stories of war and to anyone  who wants a good book to read. I give this book the HIGHEST RATING A BOOK  CAN GET!
B00000IOSU|5.0|What can I say about her. I love her! She never fails to capture the human heart in the right way. All the songs are just works of pure artistry. Her angelic voice is just so haunting so captivating and so possesive. Angel  and You Do What You Have To Do are tracks that really touches on your  emotions and hers too. The piano and her voice could ease any troubled  soul. I know mine did. The other tracks also deserve more than a hundered  spins in your CD player. The songs have great dynamics in them. Also, great  guitar textures along with sweet background vocals gives an ambient feel to  Sarah's already beautiful voice. Not forgetting the rest of the band of  course. The album has only got half of the song list in the actual concert.  So get the video of Mirrorball too!
0136879721|5.0|If there are books that can make complex things look simple, this book must be surely the best of them. The Author drives the concept of how a human  mind works in such simple words that anyone can visualize it very  easily. As it is so clear, it is easy to understand and adopt the methods,  to improve and achieve, into daily life very easily.<br />I read the book in  1994 and my life hasn't been the same since then. It has changed for the  good. Now I can confidently say that my life is in full control of myself.  This was made possible because I adopted methods as suggested in this  book.<br />No matter what's your age, where you live and how you live, this  book is a must read.
B00003OSTA|5.0|Ben-Hur is (was and will forever)the most wonderful film in the world. The sharp Heston, the beautiful Haya Haraaret, the embodiment of Roman Stephen Boyd, the attractiv Jack Hawkins, and the great Hugh Griffith - every actor  are fascinating. Mikls Rzsa (yes, my countryman!) wrote the music, Andrew  Marton (yes, again my countryman!)made the chariot-race, and of course the  wonderful William Wyler directed the film. (He wasn't my countryman)The  magnificent costumes,  scenes, and cinematography,the birth of Jesus,   Jesus in the Desert, Judah in the Roman Galley,  the Battle, The Victory  Parade, The Chariot-race,  in the Valley of the Lepers, on the Calvary...oh   God! I'm going, because I must see the Ben-Hur.
630441403X|5.0|This movie was incredible in all aspects, cinematography, acting, plot, etc.  Nicolas Cage's character exemplifies a unique view on life, and his involvement with Elizabeth Shue's character brings into question much of  what we take for granted in life.  An excellent movie that I recommend to  everyone.

B00003CX5A|5.0|Let me say, I detest Johnny Depp.<br />I saw this film under sufferance.<br />BUT it is a great movie and (surprise!) engrossing entertainment.  It is witty, scary, moody, mesmerising and fun.  The story  of the Headless Horseman is a classic and this film brings it to life in a  manner no 1950s film ever could.<br />Even Johnny D manages to keep me  absorbed!  Buy it - you won't regret it.

B000000WA4|5.0|I am a big fan of the Pumkins and I can say proudly that this my most favorite cd of theirs.  Its long and stuffed with sweet, sweet songs that make my head simply burst with glee. <br />In addition to the obvious  intant-hit-ear-catchers, there are several other brilliant tracks such as  &quot;We Only Come Out At Night&quot; (my personal favorite) &quot;Bullet  With Butterfly Wings&quot;, &quot;Thru the Eyes of Ruby&quot;, ect.  ect.<br />I cant get enough of it.
0345409671|5.0|I've read most of Rice's books, even the erotic ones she wrote under her pen name (the Sleeping Beauty series), and I think this is probably the best book she's written, next to The Vampire Lestat and The Mummy, the  other two books of hers I really enjoyed.  I think her weaving of  &quot;historical fiction&quot; is beautifully done, and she presents an  interesting take on god, the devil, and religion in general...but I don't  think she overdoes it.  She's a great storyteller!
0316777722|5.0|no one else writes with the charm of david sedaris. although I'm sure it's not, his writing seems effortless. I enjoyed this collection as much as Naked and, as always, I loved the pieces about Sedaris' family most dearly  (two notables: his father's food storage habits; sister amy's fat suit).
B00001MXXG|5.0|Ferris Buelller was all an 80's kid wanted to be. He had charm, balls an luck. No one will forget the museum, twist and shout at the parade or the sports car being crashed at the end of the movie. Since the beginning, when  Mathew Broderick is taking a shower and paraphrases John Lennon we know  that this cynic is the real thing. He has a pretty girlfriend, he can fool  his parents and can hide his frights about the upcoming future with  wisecracks and style. This movie won't mean the same for a 90's or 2000's  kid. It can't. But for all of us new wave and 80's teenagers will surely  mean a lot. If you are in your 30s, buy it.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I'm going to be honest, this is one of the best Cd's that has come out in the past five years, but it still has some downfalls. The worst tracks on the album are the ones which features guests on them.  Especially the B**ch  please II.  This song demostrates how bad dre, snoop, nate dogg has fallen  off since the days of death row. (Xzibit and Eminem come off good on this  song, esp. Em's impression of Snoop) Another downfall is how eminem  repeatedly  reminds us what his name is. Slim Shady, Marshall Mathers and  Eminem get mentioned way too often. The standout songs are Stan, Real Slim  Shady, Marshall Mathers and my favorite Kim, A prequel to Bonnie and Clyde.   This album may not be as good as his first one, but it still one of the  best out there.  100% better than the disapointing Chronic  2000................
B00000JCOV|2.0|Yeah, some of the songs on this album are good, but not many.  Instrumentally, Slipknot is no different than their Korn/Bizkit/Deftones brethren, though their drummer is pretty amazing.  But lets be real - most  of these songs are pathetic musically.  The masks are nothing but a  gimmick, and I'm not sure why the heck ANY band, let alone a thrash/metal  one, would need nine people.  If you are big into the tones or Korn, then  this is for you.  If not, not.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is one of the most well written and well produced rap CD's that I have heard in a long time.  Over 1/2 of the tracks are excellent and 3/4 of them are listenable.  That is a HUGE accomplishment in today's single  driven music industry.  The production values of Dre and Melman are second  to none and Eminem's lyrics are both humorous and cutting at the same time.   If you don't have it, BUY IT.  It is the best from this artist to date.
0380002930|5.0|I loved Watership Down and though I'm only 13 years old and I am Dutch I fully understood the book and enjoyed it the whol way through. I think that the way Richard Adams describes the way rabbits live was very realisic, and  even though talking rabbits seem a strange theme for a book, it was not  boring in any way.  While reading Watership Down I could feel with the  characters and I was gripped by the book.

0446310786|5.0|In search of a mysterious character, Scout and Jem Finch encounter many situations that put them in danger.  To Kill A Mockingbird ia a fantastic representation of the 1930's.  Now take a trip back to a time of depression  and racism in Harper Lee's, To Kill A Mockingbird. Taking place in Alabama  in the 1930's, To Kill A Mockingbird tells the story of a middle-class  family and the childrens' search for a mysterious neighbor.  The children  go through many situations and people to get to their goal of finding this  neighbor.  When they finally find him, the open everybody eyes in the town.  Lee makes the reader feel like they have known the family for years with  her great backround of the family.  She also makes the reader feel like  they are in Alabama with her great description of the situations and  characters.   The book is very well written and it will be difficult for  the reader to put the book down.  This reviewer strongley recommends you  read this timeless classics.

B0000025VU|5.0|I bought this album on its initial release, liked it then, and love it now.  A lyrical and musical triumph which spans reggae, blues, and folk-rock genres.  Jokerman and I &amp; I are absolute standouts, perhaps  the best songs written by any artist in the 1980s.  BTW, there is a  brilliant live version of I &amp; I available on the net, which more fully  communicates the awesome gravity of the lyrics.
B000002H97|4.0|Regardless of their commercial intent, Metallica had to make The Black Album.  Their previous album \\"And Justice For All\\" had many brilliant moments, but it also edged toward excess.   It's important to keep in mind  that many of Metallica's influences wrote punchy 3-4 minute songs with a  killer riff and solo.  And their Garage Revisted album demonstrated their  love to do something like that.  But, they hadn't really done that since  their early days, and they had gotten so far away from that by the time of  \\"And Justice For All.\\"  As a result, The Black Album was an artistic, as  well as commercial, commitment.  Keep it simple; keep it memorable; keep it  real.<BR><BR>  No doubt, the craft paid off; Metallica's singles (Enter  Sandman, Wherever I May Roam, Sad But True, Nothing Else Matters,  Unforgiven) have become hard rock classics.  Each song has killer hooks;  they groove even, and the latter ballad is as powerful and moving as any  song they've ever done.  Sure, Bob Rock's production is a bit too smooth,  but listen to the demos and realize that The Black Album is still thrash.   Dismiss its difficult, then, consider that similar efforts by thrash  outfits like Megadeth, Testament, and Anthrax were much, much less  successful.<BR><BR>  If there's any substantial flaw to The Black  Album, it's that it reveals what true metal aficionados already know --  Metallica is an average thrash band with world-class compositions, The  Beatles of the long-form composition.  When you compare The Black Album  with Pantera's \\"Vulgar Display Of Power.\\"  Where The Black Album waters  down thrash's edge (relentlessly midtempo, simpler rhythms, production),  \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" distills it, retaining the creativity, craft, yet  making it even more vicious.  And compare it to Metallica's older work, and  you miss out on the richness, dynamics and depth.<BR><BR>  As a whole,  though, The Black Album is a great kick-a** album.  As close to the perfect  mainstream heavy metal album anybody has ever gotten to.  It also suggested  that if Metallica could combine The Black Album's discipline with their 80s  richness, their best work would lay in the future.  Boy were we wrong . . .
B00004T9UF|5.0|Remember the first time you heard &quot;The Chronic&quot;, by Dr. Dre or &quot;Nevermind&quot;, by Nirvana and you thought to yourself nothing in the world is better than this?  Well, that's the way I felt the first time  I heard this CD.  Being a fan of all genres of music I had to give this CD  a listen.  I was amazed from beginning to end.  I rarely put in a CD and  listen to it top to bottom the first time, but this was an exception.  I  couldn't believe how tight the rythms were and how great of a flow Em has.   <br />'Stan' has to be the best track.  I cannot believe the emotion this song  invokes.  Not only lyrically, but musically as well.  The opening puts you  in the mood and pulls you into the rappers world.  You almost get teary  eyed at the end.  <br />'Marshall Mathers' is another stand out cut from this  CD.  It proves that some artists just want to be themselves in the midst of  their popularity.  Sometimes this is lost when fame gets to your head, but  Em seems to know what's what.  <br />'The Real Slim Shady' sounds more like a  cut from his first CD with it's attitude and all, but fits well in the new  mix.<br />'Kill You' is absolutely amazing.  He invokes emotions that we all  have sometimes, but are afraid to tell anyone about.  I love this  song.<br />'Criminal' is a great humorous look at how he really feels  (artistically, not literally) about himself and how others perceive  him.<br />I can't get into everything because of the explicit nature of the  CD.  If you are easily offended then you need to skip this one, but if you  understand that it's all artistic expression and not to be taken literally  then this CD is one for you to pick up.  Also if you want to bump a little  jams through your stereo this one satisfies quite well.
B00002Z88D|1.0|This is a joke right?  I mean not only do they try to take credit for doing some thing new(which is a complete lie) but they did it poorly.  They have no idea how to make classical and metal combine.  This band is a joke  and James vocals are way too loud considering he cant sing at all anyway.   If you want good classical/metal please go buy Therion or newer Rage.   These bands know what they are doing.
B00003W8NM|1.0|I've sat here and read at least 5 other reviews, and wondered if maybe I had rented the wrong movie. This movie took 45 minutes just to get started, and then once it got started, had no real substance. They took a 'Pulp  Fiction' twist and made a root canal more enjoyable. The actors/actresses  are the only reason I would see to rent this movie, let alone buy it. It's  sad to see such talent wasted on a truly boring and uneventful movie.

Out of all movies, this is the only one I can cuote lines from that kind of make me live the moment again.  Although  Admiral Kirk was victorious on this battle, at one moment he felt almost  defeated when learing of the death of his best friend; Spock...  When Spock  tells Kirk: &quot;You have been and forever shall be... my friend!&quot;  and when Kirk is addressing his crew...  &quot;Out of all lifeforms I have  encounter on my journeys, Spock was the most... Human!&quot; Are two lines  that every time I hear them, fill my heart with emotions with the same  intensity as the very first time...  Even a non-Star Trek fan should enjoy  this movie...

So the dad was drunk, and the family was  starving.This book also talks about all of the problems they faced in  Ireland and New York.     Frank tells it all. He is very graghic  with his descriptions. He makes you visualize the setting in which the  story takes place.This book is a sad story. The thing that makes it worse  is that this is a true story. Frank McCourt actually lived through it. This  book reveals the true horrers of living in the ghetto, and the poor country  of Ireland. This book catches your attention and dosn't let go. Once I  started to read, I could not stop. Thats how interesting this book is.
B00003Q438|5.0|``The Abyss: Special Edition&quot; DVD  is the reason I buy these shiny disks in the first place.  The first disk gives you the choice of seeing the special edition (near 3 hours) and the theatrical version (2 1/2  hours).  Both are good, but the special edition is more complete and  realizes the scope only hinted at in it's original release.  It can be  tasking, but that's why there's a fast forward on a DVD player in the first  place.       The second disk is chock full of material on the movie,  including trailers, storyboards, games, documentaries, the screenplay, and  a lot more. (I've had this DVD for a few days and I'm barely halfway  through all the material!)             But by and large, the reason I got  this one is because this is a great movie.  It's not just one of the best  thrillers of the 1980's, but it's also one of writer/director Jim Cameron's  best movies ever.  A great DVD for a great film.

B00003CX59|5.0|After watching Tim Burton's &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; on video I was overwhelmed by its power. That it won no major awards is a mystery, This film has everything going for it: great story, fastastic visuals and  effects, great cast, and settings and atmospheres second to none I've seen  well-in other Tim Burton films! Long ago I saw again and again the Disney  version of this story and it had all the earmarks of Disney, toning down  the violence, going more for humor and sweetness. After seing the visions  that Burton conjures like some cinematic warlock, Disney's cartoon pales in  almost every phase. Violence? Yes, but Burton's violence is stylized and  not really that gory but it is scary, filling the screen with amazing  images of twisted trees, fogs, distant, haunted vistas; the art direction  and photography are magical and set the right tone for the story. Yes,  after a bit, it seems too many heads have been lopped off and there is some  confusion to who is still left to solve the mystery and battle the  invinsible Headless Horseman. Funny thing about legends;this Headless  Horseman character in the Disney version haunted and excited me as a child  and Burton's Horseman, darkly malevolent, almost immortal, is one mean  presence. Burton works many times with actors he's confortable with like  Johnny Depp, excellent as Ichabod Crane, and and all-star suppoting cast,  including Christine Ricci, Jeffery Jones, Michael Gabon, Michael Gogh  (Burton's faithful butler Alfred in his two &quot;Batman&quot; movies) and  cameos by Martin Landau (beheaded without having a line to utter), and  Chistopher Lee, veteran of dozens of horror movies, a strong brief  appearance and we hear that great booming voice of his. Burton had a  similar cameo for Vincent Price. I can't praise enough  the visual look of  this movie. In its darkness, there is a beauty rare in any of this or any  other year's films. Burton loves these gothic landscapes, and tales told by  firelight and dark woods taking on a life of their own. This is a great  film. Burton raely gets the praise he deserves; for some reason Hollywood  just doesn't embrace his visions. Rarely does Burton repeat himself,  risking his considerable powers on unusual prodjects like &quot;Sleepy  Hollow,&quot; a film that will eventually become a classic in its  genre.Please, if you havn't seen it, run and rent it and if you are lucky  to see it if it comes to your town on the big screen, see it again and just  marvel at this dark and fantastic tale told in wild, beautiful,and stunning  images.
0316777722|4.0|This collection is incredibly funny.  Nobody spins a demented yarn quite like Sedaris and if a fraction of his observations reflect his actual experience, then his is a life (and mind) of epic comic  proportions.<br />Though the book seems somewhat fractured due to the previous  publication of some if its stories, its hilarity will stick to your ribs  like meatloaf poached in seawater.
B000002UA0|1.0|I realize people have to start somewhere, but this is definitely a bad way to start. Just because it has the name &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; on it does not mean it is any good. They use sound effects, not instruments. The  effect is one that resembles a kid getting a hold of some noisemakers and  his fathers tape recorder. The music that is featured on the album sounds  like early Who. Do not buy this album.
B00004T9UF|3.0|The marshall mather lp wasnt what i had expected.  The cd is cool its got some good songs but its not better than the first one.  Eminem has the ability to do better, working with dr dre this shouldve been the best cd  ever, but....

The  music is ethereal, jazzy,sexy and totally hypnotic to the human ear.<br />The  cameo performances from Julee Cruise helps, her voice is much like the  melodies, beautiful and dreamy, pure heaven.<br />It brings you back to Peaks,  a feeling I will never tire of.
B000002KOY|5.0|Danny Whitten overdosed in 1972, shortly after failing to be sober enough to tour with Neil Young.  The loss of Whitten almost certainly put Young in the darkness for several years.  What a loss!  This album boasts four  outstanding Whitten compositions and several more strong vocals.  The  effect of the record is somewhere between late sixties Rolling Stones and  the most disturbed sixties Neil Young.  This may be due in part to the  presence of Stones session man and Buffalo Springfield producer Jack  Nitzsche on piano (and production).   In addition to the Horse and Nitzsche  there are two fabulous young guitar players, Nils Lofgren and Ry Cooder.   Not to be missed and very comparable to Neil Young's contemporary offering  'After the Goldrush'.
0452279488|4.0|I've always been drawn to older women-younger men relationships, and that was the main reason why I decided to try out this novel.  I'm glad to say that i have NO REGRETS!  'The Love Letter' is contemplative, funny,  intelligent, provocative, wise, and sexy.  <br />It was nice that there was a  he-said/she-said scenario.  'The Love Letter' allows the reader to take a  close-up look at the cynical,&quot;older woman&quot; Helen and at the  earnest &quot;younger man&quot; Johnny.  I thought it was interesting how  both characters have very real flaws: Helen is a bossy, manipulative, and  opinionated forty year-old while Johnny is an idealistic, sometimes  immature and irresponsible twenty year-old. These are REAL people you can  identify with! <br />The writer also explores the many cultural and  intellectual differences posed by the twenty years that separate Helen and  Johnny - she doesn't gloss over nor does she over-dramatize the generation  gap.  There are many warm, quirky moments between the two unlikely lovers  and you can't help but hope that everything works out for them.  <br />This  novel also parades a host of colourful characters ranging from Helen's  irascible grandmother and urbane mother to the mysterious Miss Skattergoods  and other assorted inhabitants of the small town of Perquot. And of course,  there is THE LOVE LETTER which sets everything into motion at the beginning  of the novel.  All these ingredients add fun and humour to an otherwise  rather serious and thoughtful book.        <br />Although the story does move  rather slowly, it is liberally sprinkled with clever word play, beautiful  imagery and witty exchanges that make the wait worthwhile.  My only real  complaint is the ending which had perhaps a little less closure than I  would have preferred. <br />Definitely a book that I shall cherish and read  over and over again!
B00003CWQ2|5.0|Rolling Stone's Peter Travers lavished so much praise on this film (four  mentions in his year-end best-of list) that it was with a considerable  amount of sarcasm that I put this tape on.  Happily, the film actually  holds up to the accolades.<br />Though it starts off as yet another  post-modern MTV kind of irreverent thrill-ride, Fight Club soon  distinguishes itself, at first by its performances.  Edward Norton's  low-key conviction scores again; he is the highly able center of this film,  the human core amidst all the dazzling filmmaking, expressionistic  lighting, and strange scenarios.  Helena Bonham Carter also distinguishes  herself, playing to perfection the same kind of nutball she played in  Getting It Right, and by the time Brad Pitt enters the picture, I was  hooked.  Director David Fincher remains one of those directors who could  use the limited Pitt effectively, and Pitt is great in this film -- using  his impressive physicality to the max, staying within his range, and  working like a charm.<br />The film's one fault is overlength.  Nearing its  second hour the film's gross-out humour and sociological and psychological  irreverence start to wear thin, deteriorating into a kind of extended  imitation of a previous Pitt vehicle, 12 Monkeys.  Thankfully, Fincher  concocts another visually impressive, visceral ending to bring life back  into the film, and Norton in the final reel is a delight as he struggles  with his identity crisis.<br />A producer last year made the comment that with  Being John Malkovich, Fight Club and Run Lola Run (perhaps throwing in that  less technically accomplished but still pioneering dark horse, The Blair  Witch Project), filmmaking has entered a new stage.  Having seen two of the  three and discovered that both hold up technically as well as narratively  and dramatically, I'm looking forward to Being John Malkovich.
0060920084|5.0|Bryson was born in Des Moines, and moved to England in his early twenties, marrying and settling down there.  This book documents a trip by car around America, starting and ending in Des Moines, after many years in the UK.  The ostensible theme of the book is a search for the perfect small town; a  sort of Ray Bradbury idealization of fifties America.  There's no such  town, of course, but Bryson just uses the theme as a springboard for some  of the funniest descriptions, stories, and digressions I have ever  read.<br />When I started reading this book, I laughed so much my wife  wouldn't let me read it in bed.  Then she picked it up and discovered how  funny it was, and wanted to read it before me.  Eventually we compromised,  and kept it in the car; the rule was that whoever was driving had to read  it to the driver.  Several times, however, the reader was laughing so hard  that they couldn't get comprehensible words out, and the driver had to pull  over to the hard shoulder and grab the book for themselves.<br />Yes, he's a  curmudgeon, as other reviewers here have noticed.  That's just his style.  He's not deep, either; his occasional ruminations aren't negligible, but  he's no Mark Twain.  But he has an acidly sharp eye for inanity and  stupidity, and his anecdotal technique is flawless.<br />His other travel  books are along much the same lines, but to me this is the funniest, though  &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; does show he is capable of good  introspective writing.  &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is sharp, satirical,  acute, and unkind--wickedly funny in every sense of the word.
B00004SCX6|1.0|My young daughter bought this CD with money she got for her birthday.  What's with all the cutesy boyfriend talk before half her songs?  Her cover of &quot;satisfaction&quot; is awful, and it sounds like she used the same  midi tracks in the instrumental backups to all her songs.  In the first few  songs I can her the obvious digital enhancement of her voice, too.  Is it  that easy to get into the pop business?  I remember way back when - when  musicians had to have *talent* to get in the business!
B000002952|4.0|Even more than artists like Celia Cruz, Estefan has popularized Cuban music and brought it into the mainstream.  This is a well thought out album with many good songs, only a few fillers and a great beat.  My only  complaint, and I'm not trying to insult Estefan, is that there are other  singers out there with a much better dynamic range (Celia Cruz, to name a  big one).  Still, you have to give her credit for boosting Cuban music  sales and for doing a very solid job interpreting many classics and new  works.
0800177177|3.0|This movie had a lot going for it - it starred the excellent Gary Oldman  and Anthony Hopkins, was directed by the creator of 'Apocalypse Now' and  generally promised to be a beautiful, engaging movie.  Perhaps  unsurprisingly, it couldn't live up to all this!<br />Allegedly based closely  on Bram Stoker's novel, Coppola actually takes breathtaking liberties with  the story - the original novel never suggests that the Count had any sort  of lost love or that he had any identity other than Dracula.  Coppola  replaces Victorian reserve with overt erotic symbolism - lots of blood, sex  and nudity, in other words.  So he's strayed from the original story (not  unusual these days) and has created a picture where the visuals (which are  very impressive, particularly on this DVD release) are far more important  than the story.<br />The film does have its good points - Oldman makes an  excellent vampire (even though, in his old-Dracula make-up, he reminds me  of Glenn Close), his living-shadow effect is truly chilling, and the  absinth-hallucination scene is great.  And this film has nowhere near as  many bad points as Kenneth Branagh's version of Mary Shelley's  Frankenstein!
B00003CX5A|5.0|I don't think I have actually ever seen anyone give this bad marks. How can you with over-excellent special effects, art direction, story, direction, costumes and casting! It is impossible to dislike! <br />For your  information Sleepy Hollow is my 2nd favourite movie and is becoming very  close to been my favourite no. 1. <br />I am anything but a Johnny Depp fan,  but he deserves an Academy Award nominaation for his role as Ichabod Crane,  a small-town counstable who has been sent to investigate the decapiting  murders of the town of Sleepy Hollow!<br />You'll scream, you'll laugh, you'll  have fun! Don't miss &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; - the best film of 1999!
6305297525|4.0|If I could split my rating into two parts, I'd give this video five stars  for its visual effects and about two stars for its plot.  The use of CGI to  create a heaven uniquely personalised to Robin Williams' character is  stunning - his version of paradise is based on his wife's paintings, and  everything is textured as if it's really made out of oil paint.  The  flowers, the sky, the shimmering surface of the lake - everything is almost  unimaginably beautiful.  The Hell he visits is a nasty place, though it's  not quite as impressive as the film's visions of Heaven.<br />'What Dreams May  Come' is only disappointing when you consider the message behind the story;  muddled together from dozens of religions, philosphies and New Age beliefs,  it ends up being a vision of the afterlife with very skewed morals: when  the hero's wife commits suicide, she is condemned to spend eternity in  Hell!  I mean, come on!  This is a terrible message.  I was also  unimpressed by the central couple's ultimate reincarnation as  toddlers-in-love - this was awfully cheesy.  If you want more intelligent  examinations of mortality / the afterlife, watch 'The Sixth Sense' or even  'Being John Malkovich'.  But for breathtaking special effects (probably  best appreciated on a widescreen TV), 'What Dreams May Come' can't be  beaten.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zep wasnt realy my era but they are a leganddary band any one who doesnt have this CD is missing out on some great stuff. &quot;Black Dog&quot; has  got to be THE greatest song ever writen the lyrics are  superb and the music fits to then like a glove..(im just going on now so im  gunna stop)
B00001U0GQ|5.0|This film was a real string to Daniel Day-Lewis' bow (no pun intended); having proved he could play every type of English character (from a toff in the Merchant-Ivory Forster-adaptation 'Room With A View' to a modern-day  London punk in 'My Beautiful Launderette') he passes himself off admirably  here as an American settler gone native: Hawkeye, the last of the Mohicans.   Based on James Fenimore Cooper's comparatively dry and slow-moving novel  of the same name, Michael Mann's film is a rousing, beautiful and romantic  adaptation, with a buff Day-Lewis charming the winsome Madeleine Stowe and  skilfully slaughtering his enemies in brutal hand-to-hand combat.  This is  one of the few Hollywood movies to incorporate history, romance and action  so effectively.  A very, very good DVD.
0385493622|5.0|This is a book that you'll probably read in from back to cover without stopping much.  It's just that good.  Some of the early examples of proofs are simple yet brilliantly explained (e.g. that there are an infinite  number of prime numbers).<br />The only regret is that the actual proof of  Fermat's theory is not explained...perhaps an obvious point considering  that the original was 144 pages long and probably few people could follow,  but I would have liked to get a little more in depth on how the actual  proff went.
B00001QEE8|5.0|The feature-length cartoons Disney continues to produce are fine films, but nowhere near as good as classics like The Jungle Book.  Unburdened by the modern-day Disney habit of giving every film a heavy family-friendly  moral message, the Jungle Book is just 100% pure fun, with a cool hero  (Mowgli), entertaining friends (especially the bear Baloo) and some great  villainous characters (most memorably Shere Khan the tiger).  This movie  was made years before Phil Collins or Elton John were drafted in as cartoon  soundtrack composers, and the songs are just awesome - &quot;The Bare  Necessities&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be Like You&quot; and Kaa the snake's  hissed encouragement to &quot;Trust in Me&quot;.  Get this DVD while you  can!
B000002IG4|5.0|In my review for ...But Seriously, I implied that his 1989 chart-topper was the only essential Collins album.  I was wrong.  &quot;Hello, I must be  going!&quot; is a great collection of songs, and one in the eye for anyone  who thinks all PC songs sound alike.  The variety here of moods, tempos and  ideas is striking.  I've never done this before on an amazon review, but  here is a track by track analysis:<br />&quot;I Don't Care Anymore&quot;:  Listen to this one in the car on the way home from work--it will make you  feel much better.  Make sure to scream along with Phil.  A hard rocker,  rather In the Air Tonight-ish with its drums...still heard occasionally on  classic rock stations.<br />&quot;I Cannot Believe it's True&quot;: As a  whole, HIMBG is less funky than Face Value, but PC brings the funk on this  song.  Great performance by the Phenix Horns.  Good song, but my least  favorite on the album (that should tell you something about the  album!)<br />&quot;Like China&quot;: Can Phil rock?   This is one of PC's  only songs with a straightforward guitar riff rock beat...and also, a good  hook and great lyrics from Phil--tells a story of a young cockney lad  (Phil) who promises to hold his young inexperienced girlfriend &quot;like  china.&quot;<br />&quot;Do You Know Do You Care&quot;: Phil is phenomenal when  he's pissed off (see In the Air Tonight, Domino, and track one of this same  album!)...this is a slow and powerful song filled with rage at Phil's  ex-wife (let us all prey to have better luck with marriage than Phil).   Great when you're in the mood to let off some steam.<br />&quot;You Can't  Hurry Love&quot;: Okay, I don't have to fill you in on this one cos you all  know it.  A great pop song and ode to Motown.<br />&quot;It Doesn't Matter to  Me&quot;: Another good pop song from Phil with a nice hook and appealing  horns, but all together one of the less special songs on the album.  A very  happy song, considering the title and the subject matter.<br />&quot;Thru  These Walls&quot;: PC used to introduce this song with, &quot;This is for  all you perverts out there,&quot; or something to that effect.  A slow drum  machine rhythm sets the tone for this one, which has Phil enjoying  listening to a couple make love through the walls (presumably his ex-wife  and her lover).  An interesting song.<br />&quot;Don't let him steal your  heart away&quot;: When Phil brings the funk, he's good.  When he's pissed  off, he's even better...but he's at his best with plaintive, deeply  personal compositions where we all feel the same emotions he's feeling.   This song is a perfect example of the latter.<br />&quot;The West Side&quot;:  The funk is back!  A driving and powerful musical piece, much better than  its Face Value companion piece, &quot;Hand in Hand.&quot;<br />&quot;Why Can't  it Wait Till Morning&quot;: Another one of those plaintive, deeply personal  compositions...a great one to just close your eyes and listen to, it ends  the album on a positive yet solemn note.  <br />HIMBG is an absolutely  essential album for anyone who likes Phil Collins' music, and is a Godsend  for those of us who have come to appreciate the magic of his voice and his  works.
B00004T9UF|5.0|i don't like eminem. to tell the truth, &quot;the slim shady LP&quot; was like noise to my ears. it was all too hip-hop-happy, and was just like any other west coast rap production : teenie bopper stuff.<br />now, listen to  &quot;stan&quot;, track four of &quot;the marshall mathers&quot;.<br />back  already? this nin-minute-track is the one that embodies the CD perfectly :  violent, lyrical, with a beautiful loop. this guy has outdone himself.  unlike his previous work, and unlike anything made by the east coast (read  : wu-tang clan) now i'm not THE expert on rap, but you can bet i darn liked  this LP. And you will, too.
B000005S0E|3.0|Quirky, strange, excellent for fingerpainting on a  rainy day. &quot;The Top&quot; is like a practice run for &quot;Head on the Door&quot;---brillance shines through, but it would take a couple of years  before full-blown genius took shape (and &quot;Head..&quot; remains one of  my favorite all time albums ever, since that first listen in the fall of  '85). &quot;Top&quot; is essential for anyone who wants to understand the  evolution of a seminal band--those with short attention spans need not  apply.
B000002KCI|4.0|This is one of the best of his efforts from the latter half of the Seventies. &quot;Cortez the Killer&quot; and &quot;Barstool Blues&quot; are two of his best songs of that period, and there is plenty more to recommend  the album, like the CSNY track &quot;Through My Sails&quot;. But it makes  one wonder why Reprise chose to release this on CD while holding back the  others of this period--TIME FADES AWAY, ON THE BEACH, and AMERICAN STARS  &amp; BARS survive only as scratchy vinyl relics. If LANDING ON WATER can  make it to CD, then why not these?
0553573403|5.0|George R.R. Martin's &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; and &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; have become the benchmark for all other fantasy novels.  So far, none can even APPROACH these two books.  (Including Brooks, Eddings,  and Goodkind, although JV Jones' &quot;A Cavern of Black Ice&quot; comes  close.)<br />These two books break all of the old and tired sterotypes  present in other fantasy novels.  It is refreshing to read a book where the  hero doesn't constantly &quot;save the day&quot; with their newly found  magic.<br />The characters are extremely well developed and realistic, and  continuely get more interesting.  The book is never dull, and I was always  wondering what would happen next!  (I'm dying for the third one! )  Martin  has created a world that seems almost real, and even his handling of magic  seems almost believable.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone, even  those who don't typically read fantasy.  These books combine the very best  from several genres... fantasy, suspense, mystery and action, and have  become in my mind, the greatest fantasy novels to date.
B000002C2E|4.0|Time Out of Mind is the kind of album I listen tofrom start to finish verses listening to only a track or two over and over again. Thematically, it is about loss, particullary over a past lover. I find it a great album  to listen to when I'm in a mood for blues. It is not a folk album, at least  not when compared to many of his early albums and so what? Dylan is  excellent at taking a standard form and reinventing it. &quot;To Feel My  Love&quot; is an exception to the lament of Time Out of Mind. A few years  ago Garth Brookes did a nice cover of it, but I prefer Dylan's version.  Yes, his voice has changed, but but that shouldn't be surprising after how  many years he has been singing. Don't let it it stop you from enjoying this  album.
6304372620|2.0|If you liked the Shawshank Redemption, this is probably your kind of movie. Personally I hated both. There's no realism here, no characters. Everything in this movie is meant to underline the highly questionable  message that society and justice is the main cause of crime, a message that  also goes at the expense of good moviemaking.
6304711921|5.0|When I first saw this movie I was only 10 years-old and I though it was kind of weird. Now that I'm 17 years-old I think I understand it and like it more! It kind of scared when I was 10, but now its such a cute movie!
6305426651|1.0|Sorry everyone but I thought this was a real turkey shoot. The humour was contrived, hammy &amp; very lame. I guess my major reason for disliking this film was as a consequence of Benigni being both the egotistical  director &amp; star. He certainly gave himself centre stage. While his  screen &amp; real life wife was obsequiously adoring &amp; dippy, &amp; his  screen son was just a mail-order doll for pathos. Roberto was a totally  foolish character, who was unable to raise any empathy with me. We don't  actually get to see who shoots Roberto - but I would be more than happy to  admit to pulling the trigger.<br />The fact that this farce was set during the  infamous holocaust was not a problem for me - but clearly offensive to some  people. I suspect that people who cried during this film, would also have  cried during &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. As both films make a fairytale out  of a harsh reality.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Ya don't get me wrong this album is pretty good but only like 4-5 songs are good, his first album was all good, all the songs were tight!  Eminem is a tight rapper but he still needs to get some more guests on more songs  like number 15 on this album, he's got Dre, Snoop and others who make it  sound really good! go out and get album cause those 4-5 songs are really  good!
6300215717|5.0|You simply cannot go through life without rewarding yourself by viewing Audrey Hepburn's amazing film, Roman Holiday.  Both a Classic and Contemporary love story, it will draw you in alongside Hepburn and Peck;  celebrating with them one glorious, free-spirited day inside the  magnificence of a life without bounds.  You'll find yourself wishing them  long lives of happiness and love, before you ever admit to yourself that  it's only a brilliant film.  The ending will leave you with joy, longing,  and tears, but you'll not only know it has to be that way, you'll want it  that way.  Indeed, the ending encases all of the magic of the film, and  will leave you with the same strong impression that it has given to  millions.
B0000025R3|5.0|This mid 1982 release was pure joy for me growing up in Western, New York as a young boy of 10 years of age. My parents had bought me a copy as soon as it came out. But being as young boys are i broke my vinal but soon to be  replaced at a yard sale the following week, and i still have that same  copy. I could'nt say enough how much i still love it after 18 years. The  songs stood the test of time, and are still great. my favorits are with  colin hays voice on it, Boy can this guy sing. Tunes like (I can see it in  your eyes) (underground) and the ron strkert written (people just love to  play with words) of greg hams sax blowing to the intro LOVE IT. And who  could forget greg hams written (helpless automation) along with 3 more  mentionables (touching the untouchables) (catch a star) and the song i  could listen to over and over again the haunting (down by the sea) This may  be a forgotten classic shoved away with time, but don't let that fool you.  This is an album worth remembering.
0064407667|5.0|I really loved this book.  Similar to Kenneth Graham and Lewis Carroll, but with a delightful twist of woe, Lemony Snicket combines humor with an exciting and most unclicheic plot.  Although you have  your typical  villain, and your charming, intelligent, and lovely little children, the  woeful twists add a lot of humor to a tired-out storyline, and freshing it  up far more than most recent authors.  I highly recommend this book.

0792844793|5.0|a true American Classic-I eagerly anticipated the release of this DVD, the transfer is stunning, colors are lush and accurate, the sound is great.  My only criticism is the lack of English subtitles-only French and Spanish  subtitles are provided...at least you get the original theatrical  trailer...
B000002HPV|5.0|Okay..Please don't catogrize bjork under Iceland or icelandic anymore. She might be but her music is not. Just because her music is out of the usual American Radio stuff, doesn't mean she is ought to be compared to tori amos  or catogarized as &quot;icelandic tunes&quot; which totally minimize  everything wonderous about her music and make me disgusted. This is music  beyond that. Homogenic is a perfect example.
630512762X|5.0|&quot;Face/Off&quot; is a sizzling action melodrama that stands as the  greatest example thus far of John Woo's talent for spectacular mayhem and  balletic action sequences. The plot of this one is fairly original -- how a  cop surgically swaps faces with the criminal he is tracking -- but the  unmistakable touches of John Woo are all there: two-handed gun battles,  slow-motion destruction and bodies propelled through the air. Woo, who  despises realism, always favours spectacle over accuracy and for this, he  is famous for being one of the most original and exciting filmakers living  today. His characterisations, for this very same reason, tend to be  shallow; his treatment of moral issues, minimalistic. His achievement is  his unique attempt to make violence aesthetically pleasing.
B00003CWOL|4.0|This is an all round great movie that offers so much to the viewer.  The plot is original and well crafted.  It offers an intelligent, sometimes violent, but ultimately lighthearted telling of two banished angels who  have found a loop hole which will enable them to re-enter the gates of  heaven.  However, this cannot be allowed to happen, for it would negate all  existence.  It is up to the cynical Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), accompanied  by two unlikely prophets, Jay &amp; Silent Bob (who provide some hilarious  moments) and the &quot;13 apostle&quot;, (Chris Rock) to stop them.<br />This  is probably Kevin Smith's finest work yet, despite it being aimed at a more  mainstream market than his usual audience.   He uses the same type of  characters and much of the same cast as those which made Mall Rats, Chasing  Amy and Clerks so watchable.  It is a very creative, hilarious, fantasy  tale that I can watch over and over again.  <br />The Dvd quality is  complimentary to the movie.  The 5.1 surround makes full use of its  capabilities while the picture is clear.  However the extras are  dissapointing.  For such an interesting movie, it would have been good to  understand more about the making of and Kevin Smith's vision, Nonetheless,  it is still a must have in your collection.
B000005S0I|4.0|I hate to say it, but I'm old enough to recall searching racks and racks of vinyl albums for this one!<br />This album was The Cure's first. (Their Peel session EP doesn't contain enough tracks to make it a real  album....but it has a fantastic version of Boys Don't Cry.) Any  semi-serious Cure fan will quickly realize that most of the tracks on  &quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot; made it onto their U.S. Debut album:  &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;.<br />While moody and quirky, this album is not a  showcase for The Cure.  This early work shows Robert Smith's attempts at  defining a sound for the group before they knew what they were doing.  Its  heavy Punk influence overshadows the dark and sad mood of the words of most  of the songs.<br />This album does contain a few gems like Meathook, Plastic  Passion,  and 10:15 Saturday Night, and it MUST be part of any Cure fan's  collection... but if you like the layered, synth-heavy tones of  &quot;Disintegration&quot;, or the angry and loud &quot;Kiss Me Kiss Me  Kiss Me&quot;, then this one is NOT for you.
B00004T9UF|5.0|THIS CD IS VERY VERY GOOD.  IT CONTAINS: 1 PART DRUGS/ 2 PARTS VIOLENCE.  EVERY SONG IS EXCELLENT.  IT DOESNT HAVE THE HAPPY, FUNKY BEATS OF SLIM SHADY, EXCEPT REAL SLIM SHADY.  SO, IN SHORT, IF YOU LIKE ANY KIND OF RAP,  IF YOUR A FAN OF EMINEM, OR IF YOU LIKE CURSE WORDS, BUY THIS CD
B000002U6E|5.0|I bought this CD back in 1994 when it came out for the song &quot;Return to Innocence&quot;.  Now I have all 4 Enigma CDs.  My favorite right now is &quot;The Dream Of The Dolphin&quot;--the mix of acoustic and electronic  music is downright mesmerizing. When I'm under lots of stress this CD is  very relaxing.  If you can, listen to this CD on a good set of speakers, it  will take you into another world.
6303012140|5.0|A very clever and very violent combination of rugged action, wittily perceptive comedy and colossal special effects. The gladiatorial conflict between the psychopath and arch-fiend Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) and his  nemesis John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) of the LAPD (cryogenically  resurrected into the SAPD police force) is genuinely exciting. The satire  of the sanitized future is extremely funny. &quot;Demolition Man&quot; is  one of the best of its kind.
B00003IPFK|3.0|I really, really like Lonesome Dove and this video production of the story. I give them 5 stars. What's a shame is that the VHS version was recorded in &quot;very long play&quot; mode. Very poor quality viewing. Can  barely make it track on my machine. The whole series was done this way. I  own them all. I am glad I do because having these wonderful stories are  worth the poor media/production. I believe people would pay more for better  quality. Now I hear that the DVD is substandard as well. It is a shame. I  was waiting for the DVDs hoping to see the job done right. I am sorry to  say that I will not buy them. Anything worth doing, is worth doing right.  Mr. McMurtry has been done an injustice and his fans have been done a  disservice in the name of maximum profit and maximum economy.
0553280325|5.0|Bradbury uses fantasy to drive home moral truths, and no where else is that more apparent than in this classic short novel.<br />The Cooger and Dark Pandemonium show invades a small town in fall, but only two young boys, Jim  and Will, understand its true intent, to prey on local citizens by giving  them their hearts' desires and then stealing their souls.  But the boys,  especially Jim, are as susceptible to the sinister charms of the carnival  as anyone else.<br />This is a word-drunk book, crammed with imagery, as  dizzyng and delightful as a Ferris Wheel.  But it's a cautionary tale too.   Bradbury seems to be telling readers that man must accept the nature of  things, for if he fools with nature he risks losing his own soul  forever.<br />I have taught this book to college students on two different  occasions.  They love it for its fantasy and horror and sense of wonder.   But this is a book for all ages.<br />(For an excellent analysis of the book,  see Stephen King's DANSE MACABRE or Russell Kirk's ENEMIES OF THE PERMANENT  THINGS.)
0671015206|5.0|I never suppose that Russian Americans group ranks first in the highest concentration of millionaire households in the United States. There are approximately 22 of every 100 households headed by someone of Russian  ancestry has a net worth of $1 million or more. Russians in  disproportionate numbers are manager-owners of businesses. (Please read an  excerpt from the book in Amason.com.) In all, I think the rich, no matter  what part of the world they came from, all share the same values that make  them rich. <br />The idea of calculating the PAW and UAW created by Thomas J.  Stanley and William D. Danko now became a commonplace in a popular  financial literature. A couple of charters in the book are devoted to  relationships with children. Authors believe the more dollars you give to  adult children, the fewer dollars these children accumulate. I think this  is absolutelly right. <br />I truly enjoy reading &quot;The Millionaire Next  Door&quot;. Anyone wanting to get rich should read this book. &quot;The  Millionaire next Door&quot; like the &quot;Richest Man in Bablyon&quot;  gives you the why people become millionaires and is a must read for anyone  who wants maximum financial success.
0064407667|5.0|Lemony Snicket is just plain impressive in this creative and original story of three miserable lives. Well developed characters, advanced vocabulary, and humour will, and already has, attracted many  readers--including me! So, read this book! I gaurantee a laugh and a  pleasant experience while reading. Other recommended books are:A Wrinkle in  Time (Madeleine L'Engle),      The Giver (Lois Lowry)
B00002MZ2T|4.0|I bought this album largely because an online friend kept reccomending it and almost always seemed to be listening to it when we chatted.  So I got it.  And at first I was somewhat, welll repulsed. &quot;Affirmation,&quot;  with declarations like &quot;I believe that junk food tastes good because  it's bad for you&quot; just was annoying (truthfully, it kinda still is).   And &quot;Hold Me&quot; didn't really make that much of an impression on  me.  But while I was in a better mood, I listened to the rest of it.  And  there are some really beautiful moments on it.  <br />&quot;I Knew I Loved  You&quot; is a very sweet song of soulmates (say that three times fast).   &quot;The Best Thing&quot; has a nice beat to it and I find myself playing  it.  &quot;Crash and Burn&quot; I loved while it was on the radio and still  do on the album.  &quot;Animal Song&quot; well has an interesting concept  but poor execution.  &quot;Two Beds and a Coffee Machine&quot; is one of  the saddest, most gorgeous songs I've heard in awhile.  It's reminiscient  of Sarah McLachlan.<br />I'll spare you my comments on every song; the above  should suffice.  While this album is sometimes too sincere for it's own  good, sometimes you need to be told things like &quot;If you need to crash  then crash and burn you're not alone.&quot; This album does that job quite  nicely.
B000002UEB|5.0|This album is not only powerful in its performances, musicianship, sense of style, and lyricality, but it is also perhaps the best Hollywood script never made. When  thinking of Tommy of Ziggy Stardust and how much of a  story those had (intro song, story songs, singles, more story songs, more  singles, singles, no real ending...)one is very impressed. Who do Tate and  DeGarmo think they are, Paddy Chayefsky? A great story, great lyrics,  profound, daring, and highly enjoyable. Not only did I hear DT's Scenes  from a Memory (which is more diverse musically but less advanced lyrically)  before hearing this, which would have made this seem somewaht  insignificant--like Gladiator compared to Braveheart--but...well imagine  how amazing this would have sounded in 1988!  I heard it in 2000! A week  ago! And my breath STILL hasn't returned! (get it?) The band is great, and  if you like DT better well...these guys came first. Heck, they INVENTED  progressive metal. You should be thankful for that. An album like this  should be heard by all with open minds. NOW!
B000002BFL|5.0|This is a Bruce Springsteen that is as quietly restrained and sparse as can be. Pared down, concise, yet with a power and intense beauty that only  deepens on further listening. These are modern-day &quot;depression&quot;  tales, each song in effect a haunting &quot;short story&quot; about people  seriously down on their luck, and the oft times desparate things their  circumstances force them to do. The stories are rendered without judgement,  but with a deep insight into human nature, and a keen eye for the parallels  between the disenfranchised of the 1990's and those caught in the great  depression of the 1930's. This is the only Bruce Springsteen album I own,  yet it is one of the seminal CDs in my collection - the ones you can count  on the fingers of your hands. Exquisite, deep, hauntingly beautiful, and  perpetually rewarding. I had not realized &quot;the boss&quot; was this  heavy.
1573228214|3.0|The book opens with Rob watching his longtime girlfriend Laura pack her bags and move out. As Laura leaves Rob puts together a list of his top five breakups, the ones that hurt the most. Rob begins to wonder whether it is  his fault his relationships never last. Between working in his record  store, Championship Vinyl, desperately trying to get Laura back, and  tracking down his top five breakups, Rob is a busy guy. Throughout High  Fidelity, the reader is led through the perilous path of Rob's past,  present, and possible future love life.   I would give this book a  seven. Although I enjoyed reading it, I sometimes grew  restless. Being a  freshman in high school most of the jokes went over my head, partly because  I didn't grow up in the same generation, and I haven't had many of the  experiences Rob talks of. The book wasn't hard to get into at all, in fact  the beginning was the best part. The ending was abrupt and reminded me of a  procrastinator anxiously trying to slip a novel in under a deadline. This  book is definitely literature of the 90's. The conversations and anecdotes  could be taken out of the mouth of any thirty year old walking down the  street. I liked this book, but I also experienced difficulties during my  reading. If you are not a music buff, the songs he talks of have absolutely  no meaning to you. Someone who is expecting classic literature beware, this  book is meant for generation X. I chose this book off a required reading  list for Social Issues, mainly because the summary caught my attention, and  I had seen previews for the movie. I couldn't type an exact description of  a reader that would enjoy this book, but I can see a man in his early  thirties relating to it. In fact the reviews on the back of the paperback  are mostly from men's magazines.  To try to capture Nick Hornby's voice  I picked this passage, \\"I call Laura first thing. I feel sick, dialing the  number, even sicker when the receptionist puts me through. She used to know  who I am, but now there's nothing in her voice at all. Laura wants to come  around on Saturday afternoon, when I'm at work, to pickup some more  underwear, and that's fine by me; we should have stopped there, but I try  to have a different sort of conversation, and she doesn't like it because  she's at work, but I persist, and she hangs up on me in tears. And I feel  like a jerk, but I couldn't stop myself. I never can.\\" pg. 67. The author  writes in first person throughout the book. As a reader you feel as if Rob  is sitting across from you, telling his story over lunch. Nick Hornby has a  individual style, instead of writing it, he confesses it. He shares the  agonies of his soul to you, Rob's new confidante.
B000002LQR|5.0|This CD is really greeeaaaaat! I like number 11 the best cuz its fun and stuff but i like them all! RHCP is like my fav band and this is one of their bestest CDS ever in the whole world.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Galzxy Quest! I thought the casting was perfect! I loved Sigourney Weaver, I didn't know she could do comedy.  Alan Rickman's performance was also wonderful considering he doesn't normally do comedies.  I think the story was original and very well written. I recomend this movie  to everyone. It has it all; action, suspense, great special effects and  lots of laughs.
B00004SST6|5.0|....well, almost.  This isn't a return to his be-bop roots and the great music he made in the late Sixties.  However, he does demonstrate his technical excellence on Absolute Benson with some great soloing.  It's  almost all instrumental, but the vocals are pretty impressive too - the  Donny Hathaway cover - The Ghetto - is a good example of this.  Benson also  covers material by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder and Marc Antoine.  Other  features are the prevalent influence of Joe Sample and the involvement of  Masters At Work (the best guys in the business).  This will probably be  popular with radio, and confirm George Benson as the doyen of smooth jazz  musicians.
B000005ITX|5.0|Where does one begin to discuss the merits of this album?  For starters, it is in my opinion one of THE all-time greatest rock albums and probably my personal favorite.  You will find that this album is unlike any other;  it somehow manages to combine the weird and bizarre with strangely familiar  and seemingly inevitable elements.  Ultra-melodic, warm and approachable,  broad in scope, the album is in a class by itself.<br />Although not a concept  album, Forever Changes flows as a cohesive work with songs that strongly  complement and augment each other.  One critic likened it to &quot;a  soundtrack to an LSD movie,&quot; and it's hard to disagree.  It has a  strong psychedelic feel to it but not in the way most other works of the  time do.  Unlike most contemporaries who just stitched acid-rock cliches  together, Forever Changes' psychedelia is less obvious and borne from  genuine, visionary genius.  Musically, much of it resembles folk rock with  symphonic orchestration, with the occasional exciting guitar freak-out; the  strings and brass go a long way in giving the album its lushness, texture,  and Latin and Middle Eastern feel.  Lyrically, Forever Changes gives Bob  Dylan a run for his money and does it without Dylan's tendency of being  overly wordy.  Cinematic, evocative, and enigmatic, the lyrics cut deep,  and you can't figure out exactly why.  The general mood of the album  eschews a lot of the communal optimism and celebratory spirit of the time;  rather, it has underlying currents of foreboding alienation and dread  alternating with wonder, romance, and reflectiveness (often all at  once!).<br />The album today sounds curiously dated yet remarkably fresh at  the same time.  It manages to sound simultaneously like the Byrds but  tougher, the Doors but less forced, Burt Bacharach/Hal David but less  maudlin, the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds but less white-bread, Bob Dylan but  less rambling, you get the idea ...<br />Absolutely essential.
B000002UTY|5.0|I've owned this album in one form or another since it first hit the racks. It has been, and will continue to be, one of my all-time favorites! I don't want to repeat the comments in the previous reviews, many of which I agree  with. The specific point I would like to bring out is about a particular  track that seems to get panned or dismissed.<br />&quot;Calvary&quot;, on  first listen, seems to be nothing short of a 13-minute exercise in  free-form noodling. Believe it or not, there is a theme running through  this song that develops with multiple listenings. (I must point out that I  don't know the intentions of Gary Duncan when he wrote this song, so these  comments are based only upon my musings.)<br />The song title could more aptly  be changed to &quot;Cavalry&quot;, which ties into the loose western theme  of the cover, songs, etc. &quot;Calvary&quot; has been used more commonly  to refer to the place where Jesus was crucified, but the word also defines  an experience of intense suffering. This song is a mental western  soundtrack for me. I can hear themes for the cavalry, the Indians, the  attack, etc. I listened to this track while watching a movie about the  Battle of Little Bighorn with the tv's sound turned down. With Custer dying  on the slight hilltop, men lying at his feet, and the war party circling  enmass for the final kill, the juxtaposition of &quot;Calvary&quot; and  &quot;Cavalry&quot;, at least becomes more clear.<br />Did Custer die for our  sins on that faraway hill? I don't know, but this track might sound  different to you the next time you listen to it. Pick it apart, see if you  can hear the call of the bugle, the horses pounding towards you, riders  swirling past in the dustclouds. Listen for the Indians' stealthy approach,  via a &quot;Hollywood-esque&quot; theme (dah-dah-dah dum-dum). I close my  eyes and see it all...
B00004SCX6|5.0|I would like to start of by saying that this album is by far Britney's BEST! work she combines R&amp;B with pop and she has also grown a lot as a person, (you can tell in the songs) If you are a Britney Spears fan of if  you just want something good to listen to buy this cd!
0790729652|4.0|BATMAN is one of the most influential films in recent years. Not only did it bring back the comic superhero genre into film, but it turned the genre upside down. No longer do superheros have to be so darned happy all the  time in bright colorful costumes with amazing super powers like Superman,  who fight crime just because it's the nice thing to do. Since then,  superheros on the screen are motivated by revenge and dress darker to blend  more into their surroundings (The Crow, Blade, Punisher). With BATMAN, the  story is more than just Batman stopping the Joker. You get a story of how  both their lives got twisted by each other and how it motivates their  hatred.<br />The look of the film brought back the brooding art-deco look  first seen in METROPOLIS in the 1920s and revisited in BLADE RUNNER in the  early 1980s. Since then we've seen it used effectively in THE CROW and DARK  CITY. The choice to use Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman was an  inspired one. Instead of acting like Mr. Mom like we were afraid of, he  added a dark psychopathic edge to the Caped Crusader erasing our memories  of the campy TV show version. Neither Val Kilmer or George Clooney have  been able to leave their mark on the character like Keaton has. And of  course you get Jack Nicholson and Jack Palance having a great time playing  the bad guys!<br />The credit for most of this magic belongs to the  imaginative director Tim Burton, who also leaves his mark on any film he  touches. Rather than just stick to the deadly serious vision that Frank  Miller created in his DARK KNIGHT graphic novels, he adds his warped comic  sensibilities. With them, he doesn't mock the Batman mythos, but adds an  uneasiness to it. One minute the Joker is murdering gangsters in a meeting  and the next he's dancing to Prince music while destroying fine art. You  don't know what to expect next! I also should mention that it has yet  another terrific soundtrack by Danny Elfman, who also changed the sound of  film music. Instead of yet another John Williams-sounding orchestra, he  also contributes a dark comic sound to his Wagnerian soundtrack.<br />I only  wish the DVD version had some extras. Knowing what a terrific visionary Tim  Burton is, I'm sure there's a lot of great sketches he and his staff did  that I'd love to see. I'd also love to hear his commentary to find out what  he was thinking while he filmed it. It was a big budget movie back in the  late 90s, so there has to be a lot of behind-the-scenes bonuses around  somewhere.usic.

B00004T9UF|4.0|This cd is definately very funny. It doesn't rate 5 stars, because some tracks are just not as interesting as others. The best songs are : Stan, Marshall Mathers, I'm back, The Real Slim Shady, and Criminal. You can see  why The Real Slim Shady is the only song on MTV and on the radio. It's the  only song that isn't too graphic for listeners. The song Kim is totally  wild but very well done. The skits are also excellent. I think it is a good  buy, but if you are expecting the songs to be anything like The Real Slim  Shady then you may be disappointed.
0790705141|5.0|I've heard much criticism about this movie not being like the way Stephen King wanted it to be but if anything, kubrick did a fantastic job at making a legacy of a horror movie. From hypnotic visuals-such as bright colors and  ghostly twins to a complete documentation of jack's breakdown this movie is  really terrifying. In fact I think this is one of the best horror movies  i've ever seen.If you ever want to see a REAL horror movie thats not full  of teenagers having sex and then being killed by some hockey mask wearing  maniac then see the shining.
B000002UD7|5.0|I seem to remember that the title of this album was supposed to be a jokey &quot;Pet Shop Boys, actually,&quot; as in &quot;What's that record?&quot; &quot;It's the Pet Shop Boys, actually.&quot; <br />I may be wrong on that  though. <br />What I can say without doubt is that this is a very fine album,  from the period when the Boys were at their creative peak (to my mind.)  <br />The album covers a wide spectrum of styles, but remains identifiably Pet  Shop Boys throughout. From the opening, no holds barred dance of One More  Night, with its sexual overtones, to the beautiful, gentle closing of Kings  Cross, whilst the styles may change, the high quality is continuous. The  songs cover a wide range of subject matters and emotions, from the lovesick  happiness in Heart to the total incomprehension on What Have I Done To  Deserve This?<br />(The album also features the sublime It Couldn't Happen  Here, the title track of the Pet Shop Boys first film. The film is  available from amazon.co.uk, and is a bizarre piece, but entertaining for  Pet Shop Boys fans.)<br />This is a very enjoyable album, and includes four UK  Top 10 singles. If you don't already own a copy, but have bothered to read  this review this far, then buy this album without hesitation.
B00004T8RK|5.0|There seems to be a strong sentiment that Pearl Jam has gone downhill since &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;Vs.&quot;  I can't disagree more.  Growing up in the early 90s, the early albums were certainly the soundtrack to my  youth due to the classic songs and angsty feel.  There are no monster smash  singles on &quot;Binaural&quot; like there were with &quot;Jeremy&quot; and  &quot;Alive.&quot;  But that's fine, because the band is more interesting,  diverse, and frankly, better.  Where an album like &quot;Ten&quot; relied  on a basic hard rock format, replete with massive guitar solos and anthemic  songs, Binaural relies on texture, hooks, and a greater sense of songcraft.   I have never heard a band mature as much as Pearl Jam has over the course  of six albums.  They incorporate punk, pop, hard rock, and a ukulele for  God's sake.  Binaural is absolutely their best album.  Buy it to hear a  great band at the absolute top of its form.
B000002BPS|5.0|This is my favourite Album that The Offspring have made. It's loud and catchy and it's great to see that the Offspring have enough guts to put on funny tracks like Intermission.<br />My favourite tracks are &quot;I  choose&quot; &quot;Gone away&quot; and &quot;Mota&quot;.<br />I just hope that  The Offspring make their new album in 2000 great like this!
B000002KDB|5.0|Pieces of the Sky wasn't so much the beginning of the road for Emmylou Harris as the ramp onto the interstate. In her major-label debut, Emmylou built on her experiences as both coffehouse folkie and harmonizing sidekick  to country-rock guru Gram Parsons, while managing to create a springboard  for the traditional country sound that marked the rest of her output during  the '70s. This is a remarkably diverse album. &quot;Bluebird Wine,&quot;  with its dancing fiddle riffs, is an otherworldly blend of bluegrass,  honkytonk, and rural funk. Danny Flowers' cryptic antiwar ballad  &quot;Before Believing&quot; captures Emmylou's brittle, haunting soprano  at its most ethereal. Emmylou shines on barroom rockers such as Merle  Haggard's &quot;Bottle Let Me Down&quot; and the late Shel Silverstein's  classic &quot;Queen of the Silver Dollar,&quot; but on Lennon and  McCartney's quietly lilting &quot;For No One&quot; she is no less  impressive. Her renditions of the Louvin brothers' &quot;If I Could Only  Win Your Love&quot; and on &quot;Sleepless Nights,&quot; a tear-jerker  penned by Boudeleaux and Felice Bryant, find her paying homage to the  songwriters her mentor Parsons had taught her to love. And her signature  song &quot;Boulder to Birmingham,&quot; a requiem to Parsons, never fails  to produce goosebumps. All in all, this is an enormously impressive album  that begs to be listened to over and over and over. . . .
0140177396|5.0|This book was way better than I expected.  I especially loved reading about the childish things that Lennie did.  Whenever you read about his actions, you'll probably let out a little laugh.  This is a good read beginning to end.<br />&quot;Which way did he go George?  Which way did he  go?&quot;
6304539258|5.0|I loved the addition of all the lost footage (Han and Jabba talk in Docking Bay 94, Luke running into Biggs before the attack) as well as the upgraded special effects and the little things jammed into original scenes  to improve them.  Originally Han chases a squad of stormtroopers into a  dead end corridor; now he chases them into a hangar bay filled with other  stormtroopers!  It's great!
0446310786|4.0|Never going outside, never talking to neighbors, and never being seen created a big fiasco in Maycomb County. To Kill a Mockingbird was a good book. It was about three Children Jem, Scout, and Dill who were on a mission to encounter Boo Radley. Boo was a man who lived in Maycomb County  and has not been seen in years. Throughout the book a major disturbance  occurs in Maycomb and there is a big trial. At the end of the book, the  children finally come in contact with Boo Radley. This book was good  because it taught four lessons: courage, growing up, education, and  prejudice. Throughout the book, there are many different times which  courage is shown. One example is when Jem lost his pants at the Radley's  and he went back to get his pants off the fence. This took a lot of courage  for Jem. The theme of growing up was shown most often thoughout the novel.  Some examples are: Scout turns down a fight for her very first time, Jem  learns to be respectful in church, and Scouts tells her uncle how to treat  kids. The theme or education was taught when the kids father, Atticus,  taught them not to judge people until you have got into their skin. This is  something that many people in the world fail to do. Finally prejudice  occured many times in the novel. There was an incident at the Radleys and  someone was in the their backyard and automatically Nate Radley thought it  was a black man. Another time of prejudice is when Scout wants to play with  Jem and Dill, Jem doesn't want her to because she is a girl and also  because of her age. These are a few times inwhich prejudice occured  throught the novel. All these themes were easy to relate to and this made  the book even more interesting.  To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story  that portrays everyday occurences.
0446310786|4.0|A story that tells of childhood curiosities and discoveries.  It is a wonderful book that can bring back many fond memories.  Full of innocence and suspense, a winning combination. Taking place over a 1 1/2 year period of time, this story tells of the mysterious neightbors, social injustices,  and of small town life.  Scout looks back at her childhood growing up with  her father Atticus, brother Jem, nanny Calpurnia, and a plethora of other  characters that add to the plot. One of the many pleasures of this book is  how each one of the characters is presented in a believable manner.   Atticus, a single father, balances work and trying to raise his two young  children, Scout and Jem a brother and sister duo, who lurk around the  mysterious Radley home to see what is inside.  Tom Robinson, an African  American accused of a crime he did not commit simply because of his race.   These characters were presented in a way that the reader can relate and  imagine.   The only problem with this book was that the ending was a little  abrupt.  Even though the main plot is solved throught the book, the book  leaves the reader wondering about the rest of everyone's lives.  If there  was an extra chapter or an epilogue, the story would be finished  completely.  Since there wasn't, the story lacked a certain ingredient that  would make it a little better. The book was a window into the world of a  young girl, her struggles and the struggles of all of the people around her  as she grows up.  Strongly recommended for teens but great for all ages.   An eye-opening look at life and the variety of things that happen to a  group of small town people.  A superior example of American literature.
6305807086|3.0|The saddest part of this movie was that it had so much potential.  The first half was terrific:  it appeared as if I was going to explore what it really meant to be &quot;me.&quot;  It was great watching Malcovich go into  his own head and seeing only a world of &quot;Malcovich, Malcovich, . . .  .&quot;<br />In the second half, it was almost as if the original story was  changed so that it would appeal to the masses.  It seemed to leave the idea  of who we really are, and seemed to fall into a slapstick lesbian  who-really-gives-a-rat's-a.. farce.  Maybe this is what viewers want; maybe  not.<br />This movie could have been up there with &quot;A Clockwork  Orange,&quot; even better than the overrated &quot;Brazil.&quot;  Too bad  it wasn't.
6304913176|1.0|I regretted paying American money to see this bloodbath.  It started out as some sort of World War Two-style film and quickly devolved into Vietnam.  I counted at least 8 different ways for people to die.  The coed shower  scene was totally unnecessary.  One thing really bugged me (no pun  intended): if the Bugs were these ten-foot-tall spider aliens that were  basically a cross between a scorpion, a &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;  velociraptor, and an M-1 tank, why are the humans shooting at them with  bullets fired from guns that are basically an M-16 grafted to a pump-action  shotgun?<br /> Do NOT buy or see this film unless you have a high threshold  for gratuitous gore.
B000002JSN|5.0|I bought this album before cd's were invented. It just plain grooves (no pun).<br />The music has stood the test of time obviously.  Anything that has done that is worth listening to.<br />Works of art:  Custard Pie, In my Time of Dying (for all the die hard satan worshiper theorists out there),  Kashmir, Bron-Yr-Aur (Golden Breast), 10 Years Gone, Boogie With Stu, Black  Country Woman, Sick Again.  Most of the rest are only some of the greatest  rock songs ever written on the same album.<br />If anybody knows how I may  absolutely get my hands on the lyrics for this album, please let me know.   Thanks.
