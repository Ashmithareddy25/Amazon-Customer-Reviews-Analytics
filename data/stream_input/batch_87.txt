B00NLLVCOI|5|Great Part, Timely Shipping!!! Thanks!
B002E2WMWG|5|Very yellow, and definitely the type of golden yellow I was looking for.  Much more yellow than my previous 3000k HID kensun kit I had on my car which was more of a lime/pale yellow color.  These are VERY yellow and contrast very nicely with 4300k HID white headlights.  Not sure of the lifespan, but for the looks, they are definitely very good looking.  No yellow vinyl is needed because of how yellow these are.
B001GJ7HCI|5|Easy dry, easy clean. Seems pretty durable so far!

B00T8QPNCW|1|Bright, and clear... Just like the ad says. Work great as running lights.  Not so good the second time, they have sent the wrong lights twice and have delayed me yet again. Ad say a,her, I asked for Amber, asked for Amber replacement... Now I have 18 red lights instead of 6. And no Amber lights...

B00002N57X|5|Our attic fan motor burned out, and our poor AC was doing double time to keep up in South MS. Now that our motor is replaced, our AC has actually gotten the house cool enough to shut off for a minute. Our power bill is happier too.

B004INNEX0|5|Perfect fit for my 2002 745. I tried multiple wiper blade brands but none would fit my car. The Amazon price I paid was less the 1/2 the dealership price.

B00Q0STFBG|4|fit like a glove
B00C9CGZ60|1|Didn't even bother installing. The tiny screw that holds the mirror to the arm was so flimsy, it was obvious that these wouldn't stay past 30mph. Really disappointed, as they look cool and I can't find any others like them.
B00JF5HR7K|4|I recently picked this up so I could squeeze 4 adults and a 70lbs dog in a car for a weekend getaway instead of having to take another car. I have this on a Jeep GC and it worked great, was able to drop a Coleman Xtreme 5 Cooler - 70 qt. on the back and two large plastic bins on the back.  Couldn't even tell it was there. Between this and my Rocket Box we had tons of space. I think the only way to take this up to 5 stars would be to have some plugs for the ends of the metal frame, but not necessary. Make sure to pick up a few tie down straps and maybe some bungie cords to secure your load.
B003ECULUU|5|The visor extendor is perfect . THe product is exactly as advertised
B0002RNSG4|5|Couldn't be easier to install. Directions are simple. High quality, well made product!

B001UE434O|5|Looking to re-plum your damaged tranny lines, then look no further than AC Delco originals from Amazon, great price and excellent fit. These are the same as the rusty factory lines that are now leaking and need replacing. Save yourself the headache of trying to repair and just buy the inexpensive originals. I tried to repair the rusty line and after three attemps,(kept blowing out a different rusted section), I gave up and went to Amazon. Pick-up a pack of dorman retaining clips since these lines do not include new retaining clips. Thanks ACDelco and Amazon!
B00BTGSIA8|5|I use these, along with CG Window Cleaner, to clean (daily) my exterior windows.  Great combo.

B005PUX0YI|1|Did not fit and doesn't weigh enough to be a boat anchor. Do not buy this product!
B001C6OZ48|5|Fit my 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport perfectly.
B004QJH91E|4|As long as you read a lot of the reviews, so you are prepared for some of the downsides of this product, you will not regret this purchase.  We traveled from Missouri to New Jersey with it and it was fabulous. I was worried about managing to secure this to the car because this sort of thing is not my thing nor my husbands, but he did it with such ease. It really took a couple of minutes and seemed extremely secure. I was so worried when we first started driving and kept checking on it, and also when we drove for a while at 80 mph, but after a while i forgot about it and went for 5 hours at a time without checking it. It barely budged the entire trip, although because we did not fill it completely things inside it moved around a little and we had more noise than was necessary i believe.  We bought the special mat that others recommend to stop it moving around and i am relieved we did. I would not use it without some kind of mat.  But the straps worked really well (despite me thinking i should buy spares). We have a Ford Taurus, if it is relevant. Yes, it can be a bit noisy, yes it is not 100% waterproof so you need to wrap trash bags around things (we did not have rain but there were tiny bits of leaves, dirt, and flies in it when i emptied it so i know a bit of rain would have entered too. and there was not much at all, don't worry, just a few things i noticed) and yes the zips are not that easy to open and close. But, all in all, for the price (around $100 we paid) and the convenience, it was really wonderful. And it does indeed fold up quite small after use, so this is a big plus if you are short on storage space.  Highly recommend.
B0027XZJCM|5|got what i needed
B006ACYXTQ|2|Price was good but took 3 weeks and 2 broken passenger mirrors later we finally got a complete set. They vibrate some making it a little annoying. Hopefully they will hold up.

B00OZVWO2M|5|Fit perfect, looks great, priced right, arrived quickly!!
B004BHZR1A|5|Looks great
B002OMMXAM|5|As every review states, easier on the butt for sure can still get saddle sore but I don't find myself squirming about within an hour. I wish the price was better, but if long rides on a KLR are what you are doing, this will help a lot.
B00XS10YKO|5|Made with High quality Material. Easy to install.
B003YYMM1E|5|Item arrived ahead of time and was size and color expected.
B00537FIRU|5|Perfect fit on 2011 Ford Explorer Limited. I'm actually amazed how easy it was to install. Very sturdy! Towed a boat/trailer GTW 4,800lbs no issues.

B0041I1II0|5|I was parked on a military post several years ago and they were demonstrating this product. When the guy sprayed it on my dusty car and wiped it off I was amazed. I ended up buying 3 cans and have never used any other wax since then. What I like is, your car does not have to be totally clean to use. I love the way the car shines and when used on the windows it repels the rain. I would recommend this product to any one who does not want to spend hours waxing and buffing their car. I am getting ready to order more since I am about to run out.

B007PBPI68|3|I ordered these to be used as reverse lights for my Jeep Wrangler after putting on some rear 1/4 panel armor and LED tail lights. They are super bright and the install was pretty simple but one of them came damaged. It only would work if you touched the wire with your finger and pressed it down. Guessing it's a soldering issue but for the price it's easier to just order another set (since 1 already works) vs. unhooking both and shipping back to Amazon. That's why I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars. Super bright though!
B00URYOAQY|5|Exactly as describes
B000GZPWTS|3|ok
B002NETE2G|5|A lot beefier than factory -- and greaseable, too!
B0077A71JO|4|Quality is good and works great.  Only problem is it does take a few minutes for it to get a signal even when sitting outside.  It can also loose signal while driving occasionally but regains it fairly quickly.  It is picking up a signal from outerspace so I can deal with a little delay.  I had it installed and wired in 15 minutes so it is worth every penny.
B00153BEA6|5|Its doing great so far, its only been about three weeks, but working smoothly. Its ran a upright freezer and an r.v.  a/c and everything in my garage. The remote read out definatly helps.
B003XPR8LI|5|Fit perfectly, no problems
B00AC83LPG|5|One of the best oil drain pans I have used. So much better then the lame 10qt tiny hole in the top for draining. Don't want to spill of almost spill oil again get this. Set it down take oil your oil drain bolt and just sit back and have a beer. Never have to move after you put it down since it has a big oil collection area unlike the round top lame ones.
B00CO2QR4U|5|Works nicely on 2010 Civic LX. Completely does its job!
B002DW256A|5|So much cheaper than the dealership said it would be. Fits like a dream and easy to remove and replace when you have something that won't fit under it.
B005ZHL9B2|5|Excellent product..something  hit my car and i thought  my car was ruined..a little elbow grease and this magic  bottle and it was like like brand new..highly  recommended!
B001AIZ5HY|1|Requires extensive amount of sanding . No change in how headlights look, perhaps even more cloudy when completed. Garbage product.
B00PB4G0DQ|5|fast shipment parts fit perfectly
B00CBQFE8E|5|Worked great without any problems.
B0010ECUIA|1|I think the air flow direction is wrong as marked on the filter. It indicates air flow from the clean white filter side to the blackened side (activated carbon side?). I would be furious if it is true because users will have activated carbon particles on their face if installed as marked! For my Hyundai XG350 car, I had to reverse the marked air flow direction. Otherwise, it would fit (or I had to remove the plastic handle like two other reviewers said). Amazon says the filter should fit my car.<br /><br />By the way, it you have a dead mouse or mold build-up in the duct, using an activated carbon filter won't help at all because the air passes the filter first and then blows over the molded duct. Such a filter will help if bad exhaust fumes come from a bad car in front of your car.
B00GIP6GRW|4|Looks great. Took a while to get it tho
B005HJMX4U|3|It's a good product, however it seems scratched and used.
B000EDSSDO|1|There are better levels on the market...this is not one of them.  The cross side to side was and stays way off.  It seems like a good idea...it is not.
B00VXFKGE6|4|it works
B00D9C2CDO|5|we bought this in order to get all our luggage to our cruise....5 adults going....ford explorer....we fit everything only because we bought this....also we don't have front slats on the top of the car only side slats, and it stayed perfectly still the whole drive (1 1/2 hours)....we did buy an extra netting to hook it down, but we didn't need to use it....
B000OI4BCQ|5|Looks amazing, easy installation. I made sure to triple check i was getting the correct part that fits my vehicle.
B004I6QA74|5|These covers are lifesavers, it keeps the wheels very very clean and saves you the hassle of trying to have them cleaned during washing, they should make one for cars too.
B008YFTKMW|4|Good product for the price
B000MCZK1U|1|junk, very stiff , after a couple of uses it seized up
B000GTJ7TA|5|Worked perfectly and no slipping
B000COSAEC|5|improved the ride on my pick up
B00ORP122E|5|My husband bought me the MAXMADE charger to keep in my car. I like how it came with a great storage case and how compact it is. I can easily store it in my car. At first I wasn't sure I would ever use it, but I recently found myself need of a jump. I was so happy I had it in my car. It was so easy to use I was truly impressed I was able to figure it out.  This is a wonderful useful gift for anyone, especially new drivers. I just bought one for my nephew who just got his first car.
B004I8O7J0|5|perfect replacement for stock ones. Most of my driving is in the dark so it is nice to be able to see better as old ones were very cloudy. I did up-grade with halogen bulbs though.
B000NJ60BQ|5|Fit perfect of my double seadoo trailer.
B00LCD8ITO|4|Not &#34;heavy duty&#34; but good mats at a good price. With some cutting, pretty well fits an '06 Toyota Highlander Hybrid. The 2nd row mat is a bit wide for my vehicle, but it works. Front mats fit with little or no cutting. Cutting may hinder the mats' ability to trap water, snow etc. as well. Cargo mat fits pretty well once trimmed. So far, they stay in place and don't shift much. The mats do have a petrol-y odor, that I am not fond of. I washed them before use and the smell is beginning to fade (I hope) after 2 weeks. I'm not sure what kind of rubber these are made of, or what potential effects inhaling them may have. I may let them air out a few more days; if the smell does not fade, my review stars will. CustomAutoCrews Inc provided a phone number on the packing slip for any concerns with the product. The guy I spoke to had no additional info as to the type of rubber these are made from.
B007S2Q9DA|4|Thank you works great
B000BUTDCA|5|Very sturdy.
B000K7H7WW|5|Big beefy and put some nice pegs on them. Very comfortable. Makes the bike look large and in charge. Connect the bolts by the radiator first.
B001KQD7LC|4|Delivery was good and price was good too. The product is not easy to use on the Drivers Side due to cable location / length.
B00Q1RS83M|5|Quality lights.  I replaced my stock fog lamps on my 2012 F150 (using Rigid's mount kit) and they look great.  Edit: Added a few photos.  [[ASIN:B00WJOA3KM Rigid Industries 46527 Fog Light Mount]]
B00IS94K6K|5|Look great! Easy to install!
B00PD97AQA|5|Used these on my 2012 F150 when I replaced my factory fog lamps with Rigid's SAE compliant D Series fog lamps.  Saved myself the time and effort of having to splice wires while laying under the front end of the truck.
B007VR6B30|5|Great product and super fast shipping
B00V97KY90|5|The fog lights fit perfectly and were very easy to install in about 15 minutes.  Great replacement for the tired factory units.
B0074JIPJI|5|It worked pretty good for my jeep and I like to see that blends with the others.... you can not notice which was the one missing.
B001UCCNDO|5|I just used this part in a 2000 lexus rx300 for the front driver's side window and it worked perfectly.  It does NOT look like the OEM regulator - the stationary top arm of the regulator that bolts to the door is shorter and moves freely in the aftermarket version (I checked multiple brands other than dorman) whereas the OEM stationary arm is longer and attaches to the main body of the regulator right under the black spring.  Don't be alarmed, it's supposed to be that way and it WILL work.  In fact, I think that removing and installing the dorman aftermarket regulator was a lot easier to work with since that top arm was not attached making the regulator less rigid as opposed to the OE design - not sure how this design change will affect it's performance and long term longevity so we'll just have to wait and see.  There are a couple of items to remember.  First, I'd recommend marking the regulator in a middle position (hatch marks where motor gear teeth meet the teeth of the regulator &#34;gear&#34;.  There is a sweet spot for the regulator where you can bolt/unbolt the window from the regulator through the holes of the door with a long 10mm socket.  Of course, if your original regulator and motor are stuck like mine were, remove the original as best as you can.  Install new motor and regulator (without window attached and I only tightened the stationary arm of the regulator and two of the motor bolts) and position the regulator in the middle.  This will help you bolt the window to the regulator as well.  At this point, I uninstalled and marked the position of the regulator gear so i could reinstall in same position once I clocked the motor - see below on how to do that.  This initial step may not be necessary and just something I did to make sure I have the correct position when you are ready for final installation and window attachment.  NOTE:  wear gloves and be careful when detaching the window motor from regulator - it is spring loaded and will snap open when you try to remove the motor so be careful your fingers don't get caught in the regulator.  Secondly, it is critical that you clock the motor BEFORE final installation - just plug in the loose motor prior to installing it to test it for smooth operation and to position it.  With the regulator detached and motor plugged in and held securely in your hand (keep your fingers away from the gear as it turns), push window button down until motor comes to a stop.  I just pushed the widow button all the way down once (to activate auto down feature) and it kept going on it's own.  It may take a little time but it should eventually stop on it's own,  then push UP on window button (gently so as NOT to activate the auto up feature) until the motor gear turns SIX complete rotations - I pushed the widow button slowly several times to achieve this.  I also marked one of the teeth with a tiny piece of blue painters tape I happened to have on hand - you can use a dab of white out or a marker as well.  Once the motor was clocked, I unplugged it and proceded with the full install again.  Attach the regulator (match up the hatch marks if you did the initial positioning step as describe above) and install in the door and attach window.  Tighten all bolts carefully and do not over tighten, especially the two window attachment bolts.  Test window up and down to check for smooth operation.  The window should operate flawlessly.  The AUTO up/down feature should also work flawlessly.  If you use auto up feature and the window rolls up all the way, stops, and rolls back down a third of the way, that means you didn't click your motor correctly and will need to uninstall and reclock the motor.  If you are not mechanically inclined, I'd recommend letting a mechanic you trust do the work for you.  Good luck!

B00YOAO95O|4|I replaced my faulty speed sensor in my 2007 Club Car Precedent. This unit fixed my problem.<br /><br />When I took my golf cart out of winter storage this year (2015) the cart would not go full speed - only about 5 miles per hr.<br /><br />I did some troubleshooting borrowing parts from my buddies cart. At first I thought it was the MCOR but it turned out to be the speed sensor - phew! - the MCOR is a lot more than $30.<br /><br />Easy install, two screws. My cart is lifted so I was able to lay on the ground and replace it in about 2 min.
B00LUPOSD4|5|These have paid for themselves on the first use.  If you are taking anything apart in you car, one of these tools will do the trick without damaging the parts or breaking clips that hold things in place.  I have used them to remove door panels and I did not break a single plastic clip.  I removed a badge with just one attempt.
B000EQPC6M|5|The pads work great. No regrets.
B000E4U18I|5|Great part. Fit perfectly, easy setup
B00A93RSIU|5|What you see is what you get :-)  The metal logo is nicely finished, and the key ring looks like it will stand up to daily use for a long time.  It's a solid keychain at a good price.
B00EOM8ZSO|5|Works well so far. as expected
B002R50NIA|1|Does not stay on in heat falls off

B002JFQFNA|4|Good pair. Way less than the Ray Bans. Good coverage.
B00LDNKI46|5|Excellent!!!
B00YVMGZXY|2|The slightest pressure on the rug causes it to tear apart. After just one outing I already have tears in the product, something I have never experienced with any other outdoor mat.  For the cost I would have expected something sturdier.
B00P808TK0|4|Direct fit, came with vehicle specific instructions for installation
B00KP3T6N4|2|Not what I expected but ok
B00SCYVEPG|5|Do what they're supposed to do

B00Q5JRHP6|5|Great quality.
B0006IX85K|5|Its use is what I wanted it for works well
B001P6WX9O|5|These items are a very good bang for the buck. I have had them on my truck for 6 months and I'm a bigger guy and have had no issues. They are easy to keep clean and pretty easy to install. There was 1 middle bracket that was tough to figure out how it lined up, but that was probably more on me and not the directions.
B009DK0S78|3|the shroud didn't fit, but i was able to take the fan off and use that on my old piece.

B003G9J4RC|5|Works great so far! easy install
B007TY6UJ0|4|Would have gave 5 stars, however when in tow mode the controls do not work the same.  This becomes very confusing when you need to adjust the mirror while driving.

B004ZF39T0|5|After an initial 3 star rating I'm going to give kensun a 5 star rating due to their excellent customer service! I originally order this kit for my 2014 Chrysler 200 and had a rapid flicker and light shut off issue due to the canbus communication system. After I was contacted by Bradley from Kensun he helped me order the correct harness (with resistor) free of charge!! Thumbs up lights look great!

B0074C7UBE|5|Hell yeah!
B00TI9UIM4|4|There were 2 listed mirrors for my auto and wouldn't you know, I received the wrong one.  But no problem ReplaceMyMirror sent out the correct one.  Got it installed by local company for $10 and it works just fine.
B0002KNVPE|5|This roll was far cheaper than anything available at a local parts store and Gates hoses are very good quality.  The bulk length was great for running the exact length that I needed and having plenty to spare for a future project.
B00B3I0I78|5|Seems well built and works fine.
B00B8B7M1A|4|Good fit and fast shipping. Remember that this is a weld in piece (like the factory). I ended up bolting this into my car because I'm not great with a welder and it turned out great.
B00IFPA4AI|5|I've got to say guying through Amazon saved me a lot of money,I know it sounds like a car insurance commercial. If you let yourself be led by these auto dealers prices you'll be broke or get ripped off all the time. I bought this item and looked up the installation on YouTube and it took no more than 5 minutes to install. My 13 year old son took care of the install it was so easy, Dealer wanted to charge me $800.00 for the same item including the part. My cost $195.00 plus shipping so total cost $202.30, Oh!  Chinese food for lunch the installer my son's fee for the install. I'll kindly pay that any day rather than get ripped off by dealer prices. Family first always.....
B005F2WFH4|5|Easy to install, Works great. Perfect match.
B003STYW5Y|5|Giants fan, nuff said.
B001PWA0IO|5|works perfect and very easy to install, a little resistance shutting the tailgate now but i expect that
B00CD2RBJQ|2|They were all scratched up, their packaging wasn't not satisfactory.  They would have stuck out farther than I liked also.  Got the Lund Factory style and love those.
B005OZNAS0|1|need to rpgram it with dealer
B00FYX2FQK|1|Did not fit my Saturn Vue 2006 even though they said it did. Stitching poor.
B005J43I56|4|These worked really well. After using a different type of Ram Mount base I found that these are much lower profile. I ended up using two (to mount my 2-way radio and my iPhone). I only have one complaints: The black coating on the ball extends sloppily onto the silver base. I took a knife to it to trim it off to look cleaner.
B00QGNSD6S|5|These add a nice touch to my Jeep. Not too bulky. Keeps me comfortable from the seat belt rubbing on my neck.
B004EIAADG|2|purchased these power station because of the many accessories. however, seems like the maker had 1 too many as all the accessories work &#34;okay&#34;. i was excited to use the blow hose on the back to blow up inflatable and air mattress but this hose has no power and wont fill a balloon. also the tire pressure is very weak. i also tried to use this to charge my dewalt radio which has an 18v battery and this machine shut down. its for cell phones and small items but just does not meet my expectations for everything else.
B00DWVN08I|5|I like this very much.  It gives my Tacoma a clean look!
B00EVFEBKU|5|This solar panel is great and the company has some of the best customer service I've ever seen. At first I had a little problem charging my iPhone 6 Plus but I think it had to do with the pickiness of my phone more than anything. Anyway, they sent me an adapter to try and I bought the Duracell 600 Watt PowerPack Pro. I was amazed at how fast the solar panel charged the PowerPack. I now have a great solution for my outdoor camping needs!
B00XZ9OZXG|5|Easy to program
B00GURQXJY|5|No problems whatsoever. Make sure ,though, that you actually look at the part well or take a picture of it and compare it with the  product photo. I almost screwed up and ordered the wrong one going on memory alone.
B00BJOG40Q|5|Everything was right & timely
B00F73F7BW|5|In my opinion they are a little too thin but that was no problem until I figure out they do not fit  on my Toyota Corolla 2010. Seller was great.
B00WB209CO|4|It doesn't atay in the windshield securely as the first one I had.
B00KTJ3ZMW|2|They do not work without more than one key reason for buying keys do not have second key
B00QW4WF2Y|5|YOU can really tell the difference
B002DPTQX2|3|A real pain to disassemble and re-assemble every time.  But it works well.
B00IE2B3KC|4|Cool
B00DBLHKWG|5|Had to study it really hard before buying to understand the difference between Sport package (apparently smoky tinted type lens) and not Sport (clearer lens) package.  Ordered the 'no Sport Package' which arrived with a clearer lens.  Automotive repair shop installed it.  Works great.  We are very pleased with it.
B007OSL3DY|5|Must be working...Tailgate's still there!
B00LUS5XLW|5|fix perfect
B00VXS2GOQ|5|The king pads work wonderfully, It saved work by keeping the tire shine off of my wheels.
B006M8KH0M|2|I returned because you have to drill holes into the car to install and I have a lease so I didn't want to install them for that reason. I cannot speak for the functionality or durability of the actual product because I only went as far as to read the initial installation instructions.<br /><br />Also I had to pay for return shipping which is rare on Amazon so I will never purchase from this seller again either.
B0002SQU9K|5|for small cars and trucks don't change your brakes without one love this time saver
B00LR435GO|5|Great product - Bought them for 4 cars plus for 2 friends. No more map folding for sun shade.
B00X6E409O|5|These work great
B004EYO5G8|5|Perfect for working on cars
B010W6MFAO|5|I had a great experience with my 6k hids I got from HIDS warehouse!  Great customer service and very informative.  I have referred my friends and some family about this company
B00MKDJ13M|5|Awesome lights
B004K6UR9E|4|looks like metal, but made of strong plastic.<br />fit my pegboard precisely as i needed them to.<br />does exactly as advertised.
B009EVP4ZW|5|Easy to install, awesome product
B007GR5GMC|5|Works well, no problems so far.
B00MOKLRS8|3|The tubes came with small dents.Not a huge problem but annoying.
B004F04Q4M|1|missing bmw logo (was just a sticker) and missing key ringers. poor quality. avoid
B0013HHTSA|3|Didn't work for what I needed
B000L9AD2K|5|Great.. Why I did not find it earlier...
B0032HBXJ0|4|Fits my 2012 Raptor like a glove. Works perfectly. Easy to install. I have only had it for a week. I am not sure about the durability over time. So far it was with standed rain and a car wash. We did use weather striping to seal in some grabs to make it as water proof as possible.
B002RNFP3A|5|I used this product (manually) on a dark metallic blue vehicle with several scratches all the way through the clear coat and paint (which exposed white undercoat). This included quite a few gouges in paint left by the doors of other drivers. It removed far more of the deep scratches than other products and almost all of the shallower scrapes. Moreover, the visible area of the deep scratches and gouges was reduced by about half. I noticed with a second spot application that even the worst scrapes shrank still further. Really great product and should save on detailing $$. Highly recommended
B003KXGU4E|5|Love it.
B0019891NO|3|USB ports stop working after 3 months use....
B000F5XQMO|5|Okay Moms, listen up. I purchased this for my son. Along with some knife magnetic holders. I anchored the knife holders to the wall and then placed this pan on them so that my son can play with his magnets. The Tray is huge!!! and you can take it on and off the wall.  I'll take a picture soon and share it. My son absolutely loves this.
B000VT5776|5|Perfect fit for 2008 Wrangler, lets a good amount of heat out on a hot day
B000E4VG00|5|Works great. Easy to install.
B00KQNVD4S|5|Key arrived in great condition in a timely matter! Thanks Discount Keyless. I was back on the road in no time. :)
B00KN1AD12|1|I spent about 4 hours attaching this to my car. It was so tight that I could shake my entire vehicle with the bars and it wouldn't move but I was still a little concerned about them staying on and so I tested them on a road trip (I just had the bars on). They stayed on fine for about three hours and then I drove through a bit of rain. Within 5 minutes they flew right off my roof going 120 kms per hour (about 70 miles) and luckily landed in the shoulder. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Buy a better one as you will have to anyways.
B00199HP4A|5|very good
B00ANZHG7C|5|Far more than met my expectations...I am able to clean more than I thought possible...a best buy
B011BTE32E|5|Great product. I ordered it on Friday and got it Monday.  Looks great on my car
B00318RIJ4|5|guuud
B002MPVGKY|4|So the ramp it's self showed up in very shabby condition!  No fault of the carrier!  Apparently that is just how they show up to the ramp company from China!  So on the ramp, the bottom half was bowed in the middle, tons of screws loose including the two that hold it together in the middle where it folds in half and all the other reviews that say this ramp has sharp edges,... Well they weren't kidding!!!!  So after cleaning myself up from the few cuts I got from the ramp, I tried it out with my four boxers!  They took to it like it was nothing new!!!  After making some minor fixes and tightening screws up, the ramp works fine.  I did have the latch that holds the ramp closed fall of the morning after I got the ramp and I had not even used it, except to open the ramp when I got it out of the box.  So to say the least I was slightly disappointed with this very spendy purchase!  But this is where the game changes!!  After two emails with the company, I had a wonderful woman named Debra help me solve my issues and I'll tell you what, the product may not be the best, but the company that sells it and this individual that provided me with customer service was awesome!!  Debra would be the only reason I would recommend buying a ramp from this company!!  From other reviews, some people have had no issues with ramps ordered from them!!  So if you need a ramp, I would say take a chance getting a ramp from this company!!!  Even though my ramp wasn't perfect, it is useable after a few extra bucks were sunk into it, and the company cares about customer service!!  I loved Debra and she was on top of the situation the whole time! She knows what she's doing and she is darn good at it.  And there is the whole picture of my experience!  The four star rating is more for the company than the ramp, but the ramp isn't too bad! 👍🏻
B00DZAO7PQ|5|great  FIT  NO MORE GAS SMELL
B00WCAOPMA|5|I plan to purchase more just in case one comes up missing
B00ISAA6KS|5|AWESOME!!!!!
B00EHM288Y|5|great light, bright and very low current draw.  measured 0.25A on low output and 0.7A on high.  very bright even on low output.
B002R0O7PU|5|Perfect fit
B00OELXAD0|5|Perfect fit.  Car is 20 degrees cooler when I leave work at 5.
B000COCUF2|5|Exactly as needed
B000JFO1K6|5|Getting a lot of compliments.. Great for boating season.
B003LZ4IK4|4|Worked good
B0082RGJIA|4|Kind of hard to get the clear plastic off but other than that looks great
B006C2R6RA|5|This thing saved me a LOT of work and worry! I highly recommend it if you are trading our your stock stereo for an after market unit in a Dodge Ram!
B0038N8706|4|looked & fit great but the directions were fair
B001V8U12M|5|You could use a 3/4&#34; socket just as well but this travels with me and is quite handy.  I like the 3/4&#34; socket back in the tool box and this one travels.
B00W8ADB1K|5|Awesome!  Fits perfect so that passenger can slide out safely without getting hung up in it.  The unit is for a very ill person who loves bbeing organized and independent.
B00F359R60|4|This product is great for short term lock up of your helmet and jacket.
B00ZCVKZG6|5|I love this tire gauge! I always worry that I over fill my tires, or I worry that the pressure is too low. You never know what your tire pressure is exactly unless you check. This is a fantastic tool for the job. It it extremely easy to use and read. Buy with confidence. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B00M0CBV9U|5|Worked great.<br />drove through heavy wind and rain. No leakage.
B003ZS7232|4|It worked  pretty good, easy to connect.
B008QR1ASK|5|Appears to be a great product at a reasonable price.
B00CRNO7KC|5|easy installed, everything you need is supplied just like factory job. Certainly would buy from this seller again for another machine if needed... Michael
B000C9TASC|5|Great product great price wonderful seller, Thanks
B004SSAPU0|5|its cool but the metal piece brokes too easy
B005SGZCMW|5|Very good
B00BF0BK44|5|excelente:  the best
B00590WF22|5|Great fit just be mindful that the original color cap your vehicle has isn't broken or you might have to order a new mirror back cover to much your vehicle  due to this one being black.
B003DNJ728|5|fits perfectly
B000CPI0QY|5|I used this product to treat rust on the front and rear bumpers of my 10 year-old truck, which spent a few years in the snow and salt up north.  It seems very similar to a rust converter I've used from Gempler's in the past, which is a good thing.  As the product states, once you clean the surface by removing any flakes or loose dust (I use a paint scraper and then wash the surface), you apply this and it forms a hard, black coating that can then be primed and painted.  In my experience with older cars, it can really slow down the rust spots and make the car look nicer, though it's best if you can get to all the rust (which isn't always possible given trim, etc.)  I think I spent less than $30 total on this plus primer, paint, and fine sandpaper, and the truck looks great.<br /><br />One warning: when I was done I had a bit left over in the plastic cup I was using, so I decided to treat some rusty areas inside the wheel well.  In doing so, some dripped onto the concrete from the brush (which at that point had dirt, rust, and converter on it) and left much more noticeable shiny blackish stains on the concrete than I expected.  I don't care, but others might want to keep that in mind depending on the application.
B00UXO1OTO|5|Works great and easy to install.
B00EC2CG9U|4|These little bungees are exactly as shown in the picture.  Unfortunately the doubled-over 'knot' in the cord doesn't fit neatly down into the 'cone' part of the hook end.  Instead the 'knots' extend a little out into the hook portion, which can interfere a bit with hooking and unhooking the bungee.  I don't think I would buy them again because of this inconvenience.  But the cords seem to have good elasticity and, since they are indeed exactly as shown, I am giving them four stars.
B00XV82A74|4|I would have given it a higher ranking if it came with chrome screws. Now I am left with finding them. It also didn't come with a gasket. So, make sure to look at the picture.. what you see is what you get. The quality is good though
B00IPS4APU|5|Works well for the price.
B0010E3JUI|5|great
B000GZQJZ4|5|Well built switches, good price all hooked up and ready to go ,all works good. Fast shipper highly recommended!
B002DOU7HC|5|Easy to assemble and use.  Even with bikes loaded on the rack it can be extended out of the way of my Subaru Outback's hatch to access the trunk.  Bought the Anti-Sway Cradles for extra stability.  Has the features of Thule and Yakima racks at a lower price.  Very pleased with this purchase.
B005C97Q4M|3|the rubber trim was coming off when i took it out of the box.
B00TA7LKOO|5|It was nice. However, I purchased the wrong one. I was able to send it back and repurchase from somewhere else.
B00HS2J59A|4|Very good accessory for the Highlander. Helps keep the cargo area a little cooler, too, as it blocks out sunlight. Adds a little peace of mind when parking in a large public garage.
B000GU7D0Y|5|Fit right on my 1982 Honda CB900F Super Sport. Looks good. Works good. Price nice.
B00SH33SVU|3|The bulbs work great. Very bright, but I received one that does not work
B0067UB3RQ|5|The part worked great.
B008032PVG|1|How can't return  this te fuel pump fail
B004KJQD62|3|Holds gas and looks good, nothing special. Will leak out Of the cap if you hit any bumps
B001551DQY|3|Meh...<br />They're okay.<br />I've had better 'plastichrome' plate holders before...<br />I literally clipped off the 2 bottom screw holders a they looked bad...
B00MZKI64U|5|Great upgrade worth every penny. High quality.
B000ET8D0G|5|as advirtised
B000CCMLD0|5|I've used this stuff on everything from 0 scale model trains to dials on guitar amps to fixing glitchy joysticks and it works awesome. I'll always keep a can of this stuff on hand.
B00B7MYGOG|3|it fits a little small for my face, and the foam doesnt cover all the gaps to keep air out of my eyes. but the reflective coating is very helpful for the glare
B000IPAK9S|5|ok
B00MHQ9OZ2|5|These are great
B004ZF39T0|4|So far so good. Have had no real problems like some other posted have noted. Took about 30 min to put in and the lights are supper bright. Only thing is that the instructions did not state that you might have to use the OEM rubber grummets as the ones that came with the lights did not fit out application, so don't through the others away you will have issues. Would recommend to a friend and would purchase again. Good product. DC current all the way.
B003BZD08U|5|Looks solid but haven't used it yet.
B000VVSPX2|4|Just bought the cover for Sturgis, it is easy to put on and is near waterproof.<br />there was a down pour in Keystone Wednesday late afternoon, and the cover kept my electronics dry.<br />the fit on my Kawasaki Nomad was great.<br /><br />Lee Rogers
B00D3YEGO6|3|Decent.  Shiny and looks good on my SUV.  I wanted more bling, though.
B005FQTNQG|5|Great, it works perfectly!!!
B00068OLEW|5|Don't force me to write something when I don't want to write something!!!
B007P14NPU|5|Works with every vehicle I've tried it with so far! Get this along with Torque and you can read just about any 'check engine' or error light.
B00S8JU9G0|1|Not good quality.
B00KTIUG5C|5|Great price and works just as intended!
B00EJW2NOQ|4|Very pleased came with exactly noted.and shipped on time.I have a lot of time money and sweat in my quad .and choosing the rite piston is the key.quad ripps make sure to get a different jet and adjust ur needle
B0006Z9ST8|5|I had light beige cloth seats that were stained with everything from spilled coffee to soft drinks to melted chocolate - a real mess.  I used the OxiMagic spray liberally so that using a soft upholstery brush would create a &#34;lather&#34;.  Then I wiped them with some cheap white terry washcloths that I got at a local big box.  The seats look like new!  Took a little work but the results were worth it.
B00L1RUARO|5|Item delivered on time and as promised.  Factory quality!
B00C5SNVO2|5|Worked as expected. Don't forget that if you have a two inch pipe to get the bigger size.  I made this mistake. This helped to keep the tongue more stable.
B00BAYUI3E|5|Looks and fits great !!!  No smell !!!
B00OUPLCAI|5|This cradle is exactly as advertised. Fits my 9500 super winch perfectly and the craftsmanship is superb!!
B00H8PC8YQ|1|It seemed very good product but: as soon as I installed it, just after 7 km the mermaid &#34;lost&#34; her hair. I contacted the supplier, and they confirmed probably it has been a production problem of the product. They were also available to ship one additional but they discovered it was not possible for them to ship in Italy. They told me to begin the return policy with Amazon but if I remove it now I have two holes for nothing on my hood.<br />So my final rating cannot benpositive because I spent a non indifferent amount of money for a product that is made to be installed and used I hope more than 7 km.......and now I have to think to repair the hood (additional amount) or keep it in position (bad aesthetich effect).
B0071N6ZR6|5|Another product my husband loves !!
B010SH8OFW|4|I use this in my 2015 Honda Fit.  It straps nicely to the small arm rest in the car and provides just enough height for me to rest my elbow.  I have only used it for a week but the quality on initial inspection seems pretty good.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for added padding or even a cover for their arm rest.  It has two straps to wrap around the arm rest lid and they do well holding it in place.
B000O707IO|4|Works great, but I was surprised by how hot the unit gets during charging.  To avoid what I perceive as overheating, I first use my 20amp charger to bring a battery up to about 95% and them I finish it off with this unit and that eliminates the overheating worry.  So works great, but I wish the manufacture had incorporated a better heat sink.
B00070FJL8|5|Excellent product
B00AMZWJ1Q|5|Good addition to the bumper
B000X21UQI|5|Permit fit for my vehicle.  Quick shipping. Very pleased.
B00407YOR4|5|Good price fast shipping
B00DPYAGVG|5|Excellent product and transaction...Thanks!!!
B003CXF8HC|4|Fits very nicyely. High quality.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Shade it works great! Absolutely great product and the staff is fantastic too!
B00CQ7OG64|5|easy exact fit for my 2003 mitsubishi eclipse gts automatic.. all 4 of my mounts were broken. took me 5 hours to install these in my garage. engine is quiet now. dash no longer vibrates and no wheel hop.. NEVER just replace one mount always do them all!!!if you replace just one the other broken ones will destroy the brand new one! this kit sorts all of that and the price for 4 is still less than the cost you would pay for 1 at a mitsubishi dealership.. i am so happy i found this kit
B0092Z6BZ2|5|These tips took the look of my car to another level.
B00943LD7S|5|good job
B006MX8196|2|Covers have very this straps to hold on to seats. I am sure they will tear over time.
B008SEBQ2G|2|Good looks, poor reception.
B000HLY17U|5|used this to cover up a scratch on my tail gate my dad backed into a tiny trailer, covers well, and is very durable
B00Y3U1KW0|4|This is an excellent product. People who have been complaining about it being hard to install must not have a basic set of tools or maybe got a bad one that slipped through quality control. Only thing I don't like is that you have to cut factory wires to connect the licence plate light. Everything else is of the excellent quality you'd expect from an aftermarket company like yosh.
B000F0QACM|5|easy system crossover
B00EENFDNI|5|Excellent product that pays for itself in no time...
B0009YDQEE|4|Matches my car 👌 does its job. Wish it had the plastic loops to hook onto my cars floor. Other than that, perfect so far for a Mazda 3.
B00JG3OIFU|5|This product has a lot of 5 star reviews for good reason, and that's why I decided to try it. I used it on my tires and black trim, with excellent results. It is necessary to wipe off/buff the residue to achieve proper bonding and full protection the directions say. I like that the sheen is more of a satin rather than gloss. This stuff is more expensive than the others, but that's because it works better. I used a foam pad to apply and an old (not dirty, just one I could throw away) cotton towel to wipe off and buff. Highly recommended.
B0013FW1OY|5|Great replacement  well made
B006LIYLL4|5|Great
B0009OR94M|4|Fast shipping, item as described
B00BM8G2N8|4|excellent set of pads
B00KJ4W3AC|5|I ordered these 8/7/15 got them 8/15/15 and they were a perfect fit on my 2008 Impala! Looks great, at a great buy. I highly recommend this hub cap. Ten stars here!
B002BVZZDS|5|fit good
B000C581WW|4|Haven't installed this yet, but as a few other commenters mentioned, there are no Moog markings on the box or parts inside.  Box is Moog colors but no name on it.  The product looks like the Moog part in the picture but again no Moog markings.  I work in aftermarket parts and I have never seen a Moog product not come in a labeled box.  Quality looks solid and I am planing on installing so we will see what the performance holds later.  More to come...
B00D9C2CDO|5|A+
B0066QVG14|1|Plug did not fit the corresponding plug on my '87 325i.  I will be splicing the plug from my old sensor The pin diameter was too large.  The rubber that was over molded around the wires&pins was also of poor quality.

B0055QOKC8|5|Can't live with out it.  Works great!!!
B00F4MQJ5O|5|Is amazing led bar 100 leds are the best!
B00NWB2LII|3|I wish I could give more than 3 stars however, the Amber color is not very bright.  Especially in contrast to the white color.  The white is so bright, that when they switch to the Amber, there is a big noticable difference in brightness.  Also, I should have really figured out how long 30 cms are in inches because these are pretty short
B00TSZ560C|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B00HPBC1TA|5|I wish it came bigger; this is a really nice graphic of art.  I love the colors and the edge around the butterfly.
B001DCF6IA|5|I had no trouble installing a pair of these by myself (50 year old female).  As other reviewers have noted, you will need a Torx size 40 bit.  I was able to set up my bit in a 1/2 inch ratchet to get some torque to start the bolts out, I don't think I'd have got them out using the bit with a screwdriver.  I also used a multipurpose ladder to prop up the lift gate/hatch, if you have one of those around, it worked awesome!  The bumpers on the ladder legs protect the paint and keep it from shifting.  Key note, when installing the new ones, if you feel any resistance when starting the bolts in, you are cross threading and will damage the threads.  Back out, adjust the height of the hatch, and try again.  I had my best success starting the lower bolt first.  Took 15 minutes, start to finish, including 5 minutes figuring out what to use to hold up the hatch.  Not sure of durability, have seen mixed reviews on that, so will update in the future.

B000CMHIR4|5|Pretty sure I gained an extra 25 hp. I am the fast and the furious.
B007GSO8X4|5|I bought this at my local Audi dealership for $9, and it did a great job of restoring the color to the plastic in the cockpit.  Very easy to apply, make sure you read the directions, and make sure you have plenty of circulating air so you don't breathe in the fumes.  If you have a mask, it would be worth putting it on when you apply this product.
B00EC8XJAY|5|It was easy to install and what I expected.
B000K7HAW4|5|I absolutely love this seat cover. I removed the old worn out seat vinyl, and installed this one, It fit well. You will need to do a bit of stretching, and a word of caution. My staple gun had trouble setting the staples deeply enough into the hard plastic pan that Kawasaki uses. This is no fault of the seat cover, it just made installing it difficult.<br /><br />As for comfort, the extra foam made a noticeable difference in comfort over the stock seat, and the vinyl on this is so much softer than the factory seat ever was. This was a huge improvement. I took this as an opportunity to remove the useless hand grip that Kawasaki included on the seat as well.
B007245A48|3|These look great but were impossible to adjust down far enough. I had to place 6-8 washers behind a top screw to get them even close and could still use more.
B0024ECJSQ|5|Very good for only 5$
B00J36JN8C|5|Loved It!
B000KL1116|5|Wiring harness came on time and works great!
B002G3USIS|5|As described.A+ service and product.
B00EB8J3TG|5|This fit very well.  It was a little difficult to reach the plug but it works well
B00PJPHEBO|4|Worked perfectly once I found software that would reset codes successfully. I tried others including the one referenced in the instructions, but did not have any luck. I ended up going with Carista for resetting the codes even though it lacks the functionality of other software. I recommend being careful when removing the device because the outer cover is flimsy and came apart after a few uses. For the price I think it was an excellent deal.
B0027QWNGO|5|Great help in keeping the car organized
B00JL803RC|5|excellent product, sturdy and handsome
B002Y1X4NS|5|Love it
B00ARJPYKA|5|Good seller and the product works well..
B000C541T4|1|Moog makes a great product, Took over two weeks to get here, refused shipment
B00CS7T0IQ|1|This item does not fit a Polaris Ranger 900. I had to return it.
B002DPHDF0|5|Fits and works great.
B0075IRIX2|5|Very good product and delivered in a reasonable amount of time, unlike the competing brand. I would recommend draping the nearby areas of the vehicle, easy enough to do for the most part by using the convertible top and windows as hang thin plastic sheeting.
B004X96DLE|5|Perfect match for my Black 2013  Nissan  Sentra<br />Easy to use, perfect to cover small scratches  or missing  paint spots, just  follow the instructions for  best results I also  used it to cover a scratch on my stove and it seems like nothing happened.
B000CQI06S|5|Real nice
B0036QX4EY|5|Works like it should. No problems at all.
B007NNH1SQ|5|Worked GREAT!!
B00CBTBCWI|5|These gloves are great. They look amazing, especially if you're going for the retro look. Large fit my hand exactly as I thought it would, so I would go with what size you typically get. They were a little stiff, but I fixed that with some Obenauf's Leather Oil, which I would GREATLY recommend. They immediately loosened up and started flexing more.<br /><br />I have two complains though, The glove fits perfectly, but the opening is a bit small. I didn't have to struggle, but putting the glove on and taking it off is a bit more work that I'd like. Secondly, the stitching is just ok. The quality of the materials feels great, it was kind of surprising to see some loose stitching.<br /><br />The knuckles are basically 2 layers of leather. The padding is nice, but you may want something more firm. The cool thing is that the knuckle area has a &#34;pocket&#34; where you could probably slide in some firmer padding. I might even just throw in a piece of firm cardboard or something just for added padding.
B00E5PK8TE|5|perfect fit bike starts easy great product shipped fast
B00R6LZUW4|5|Love the BedRug. Easy to install and looks great.
B008A04DIW|2|not impressed with quality.
B003QMN13M|5|It looks pretty sweet on top of the new duel spectra air filter system..
B00DI3DV6G|4|Nice organizer.  I wish it had some more weight to it. Slides around in the trunk while driving.
B000C846U0|5|worked perfectly and fixed my traction control light that was on
B000C7YJ5I|5|I added an overhead console and already had the wiring to the nose. This plugged right into the stock harness and worked good from day 1
B00X0BJQ9M|5|Great product! Looks awesome.thx!
B0068G26JS|5|Great pads, my 99 Sporty is stopping like a champ.
B000GTZZ0A|5|Started the bike like a champ...even had more CCA's than the factory battery!
B006X8BATI|5|Great product and it only took about ten minutes to install. It looks really good and appears to be stock.
B00Z6D3BZW|5|These are not Snap-on tools. If they were there would be another zero in the price. Maybe two zeros. For the person, like me, that uses tools only when he needs to/ has to; this is an excellent collection at a very reasonable price.
B00LGKZ64S|5|Very happy with the product and with the results!!!
B00AZPXSWM|4|fit was off a little at the tips ends not enough 3m tap  fair quality
B003B82KMO|5|Good cover. Very easy to put on and take off
B008TTHC00|5|Great helmet! Well worth the price.
B001JT1CEE|5|Easy to peel
B0036ULEV0|4|seems to be good and hangs tight to valve stem. . .happy so far with purchase
B00KC46JAY|5|Nice
B00IS944JS|3|Great product and easy to install. Led lights are really strong and brights up the whole road and mountain. Have not seen such a bumper installed yet and almost everybody checks it out.
B006DDHZ1K|5|Ver y good
B000IPAK9S|5|Electricity seems to be traveling successfully down the entire length if this extension cord.
B00QVOCLJM|5|Great product, great price, and outstanding service
B000C2AKZ6|5|Great replacement for old and leaky exhaust manifolds on my 2500HD V8 Vortec (2005). Great quality gaskets, no more clacking sounds when cold until the old gasket finally expanded. Relatively quick and easy job if you exhaust manifold bolts are not broken!
B001KQA9YU|5|Excellent product and fulfill my expectation. However, amazon repack the package sent by the supplier which produce a higher shipping cost to my location.
B005NB7I5G|5|jut what i wanted, thank
B005N76XQ0|3|TO SMALL
B000EPMQOO|4|This one is a thousand times better than the rbp/bully pot metal fuel doors. I bought the rbp before this to save a few dollars. Big mistake on my part.<br />The all sales fuel door is better in every way. If you are only interested in cosmetics it may not matter so much, but if you want an extra layer of security that also looks great, get this one. In all my searching, the next step above this one in terms of quality runs about $100 more making this the best compromise.
B00BT1GPW6|5|Appears identical to the OEM version it replaced, and worked perfectly for a fraction of the price.
B005C2ACBI|1|Used them for transporting a bike from PA to CO.  The rachets would not release and had to take two of them apart to unload the bike.  They were a waste of money. Bought HD tie down straps. They work fine.
B000ALDQDC|5|Good replacement for 2001 Jeep.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Great Product
B004K8YK72|5|Great fit and the price was right. I had it in a few day after ordering . Very happy
B001RJN56Y|2|I purchased 2 of these for mine and my girlfriends car. Both of them barely lasted a week. Though the price is less than other places I saw, they didn't last anywhere near as long as the time I purchased in a store. Maybe they were defective or old but definitely didn't last.
B002UC30AS|5|Beautiful, vibrant colors, sticks well and stays put.. would definitely buy again!
B00EXUJ5JK|1|Circle that impala is in is not centered on the plate
B00AIJY2ZM|5|I fitted a pair into the clocks of my Honda Valkyrie motorcycle. And WOW what a difference!!
B001OZQEJG|1|Burnt my wet clutch up within the week.  Sent email to Lucas Oil with future oil recommendation and received no response. Seller rating is a 5 star.
B00802GIW4|5|Pretty fast, good quality and easy to install!...thx
B00QXOD8Y2|3|This item was thinner than what's pictured. Careful with the sharp edges!!
B00EEGEOVC|3|Work as described but the locking mechanisms are pretty worthless.  Also the rubber protective strips on teh top want to slide loose when your loading the rack with gear.
B00GG9FB8U|4|Tried this product out this past weekend, and it seems to be pretty impressive. For creating a nice shine quickly from a moderately dirty car, it does a great job. However, it was not successful in removing some acute tree sap from my paint. For that I had to use Fastwax as a spot cleaner. I will continue to use this product, although it cannot handle a really dirty vehicle. This will handle the 80-90% of the car washes I need.
B00HZX1NTM|5|Perfect fit. High quality
B0016KFVV6|5|worked great
B00HZX4OK2|5|Brighter and cleaner than the factory bulbs. They look great and all worked just fine.
B00BQF6JOY|5|It's been installed and is working as expected. Fast delivery no problems.
B0055PD1H4|5|It work , so far I just applied 1 time ,but on a bigger surfaces make lines of application visible, my guess after few applications would be fine..
B004AGADRK|5|Item direct replacement for oem. Installed without a problem. Works fine, check engine light off.
B002CEPI5O|5|Very good product great value for the price.
B00EQFNJ1M|5|Just what i needed
B003G0KCCM|5|Perfect fit in my 2010 F150 Platinum. They are not as thick as the usual Husky Liners, easy to install in 5 minutes. They cover 98% of the floor.
B00BFDG06E|5|just what I needed - Gas Cap Alarm stopped with replacement. Method of selection on site is effective.
B00K5L8CPO|5|Fast delivery great price
B0013RIOMK|5|As expected the order was processed and shipped promptly.  The inserts looked great, and more importantly snapped into place with a precise fit that spoke to a very careful tolerance in manufacturing.  Well done.
B000FJQWYO|5|Accurately described with prompt shipment.
B00K35F5XO|1|First of all, I want to say that I have never written a review on a product before, but this pump is such a rip-off that I don't want anyone else to get suckered in to wasting their hard earned money on something as useless as this. The pump worked great, but in less than five months, the vanes deteriorated, rendering the pump useless. I asked if there was a vane or gear replacement kit and was told because the pump was manufactured overseas (China), there was no way to get parts. KapscoMoto.com tried to sell me a whole new pump with a 10% discount which is actually a slap in the face since in less than five months you'll be spending your money again to get a new one. I even asked about their warranty, and was told the warranty is only good for one replacement. A product this crappy with no replacement parts should not be sold to anyone.
B004HNYKIO|5|Accurately described with prompt shipment.
B00RW4JYAY|4|Good visors. We're as advertised and fit fine. Just wish they were a little wider and covered more of the window opening, especially on the edges.
B00LH4NGDQ|5|It's exactly what I wanted!
B002G1PBW8|5|Works good.
B00OQ1F7PM|5|Excellent, works great & I love it!
B003XGYDE2|5|Bought it as a gift.  Does just what it is intended to do, plus a little more... grandkids swimming pool!
B00ROC105G|5|these work great!!!
B00062YHYM|5|I bought this for my 2008 Ninja 250. It fits perfectly and works very well.
B000NCXM1O|5|This is my 2nd Access Roll-up cover.  I had one on my 2006 Tundra and now my 2011 Tundra.  I had the 1st cover for almost 6 years and it held up nicely.  We like being able to put our luggage, etc. in the covered bed for traveling.  On the other hand, you can roll up the cover and get the full use of the bed for home projects.  Very nice and easy to install.
B00MPF2KU6|5|Was exactly like the picture. Love it.
B00WR9ERMO|5|excellent, great stuff
B00Y4G7U7C|5|great

B001Y93RKQ|5|Good product
B00891P30O|5|Arrived on time and works great! Started my 50cc gy6 4 wheeler! Still works too, and it has been months since purchased.
B00HSHTJZ0|5|Haven't had an issue. Works good
B007V6ZXQW|4|The frame is vey well-made and looks great. However, my issue is that it covers part of the &#34;New Jersey&#34; on top of the plate and completely covers &#34;Garden State&#34; on the bottom which is a violation of NJ state laws against obstructing any marking on a license plate. I'm disappointed that it wasn't made so that it wouldn't cover any wording on the license plate.
B00H26NZ7U|5|Love it soooo much!
B008DQV88Q|5|Very nice quality, lens pattern looks like the old Cibie Z beams I had in the 70s. The box is marked with a company in France and manufactured in Belgium.  Not sure how they are able to use the Cibie name but you can't beat the price and quality.<br /><br />The only other quality alternative is the Hella units but they have a flat face while these Cibie have a rounded face which looks more period on older cars.
B00RM327NG|5|Works well for traveling in the car when you don't know where to put your phone since it is so big. Also, easy to read phone as to who is calling since it is right in front of your nose! Glad I took the chance, My family likes it too so I bought each of them one. Decent product, does a good job!

B000Q6SL2W|1|Stay away this product is junk.
B007EGHOX4|1|For all their hype, they're not worth the $$$. In 15 miles the &#34;padding&#34;, also known as cheap rough foam weather stripping, gave out and the bridge cut the bridge of my nose.  Overall, a VERY POOR product.
B004SFKJIQ|4|Works well.  No problems.<br />It's portable, affordable.  What more could you expect.<br />I'd give it a 5 but how can you love a dumpster?
B001JEIHAG|4|The first time I used these my white blouse turned black. I was really upset. It did wash out and stopped staining my clothes after the first use.
B00J7HBRL8|5|Extremely bright
B00H1TSOO2|5|Great product and company. If you don't know which wires in your harness are hi or low, it can be a bit aggravation but I figured it out and couldn't be happier. Color is amazing. Can't wait to try them out on the road and not in a dark garage.
B00P2SYBJG|5|Just did all 8 of my coil packs on my 4.6 Triton and my Expedition has never ran better. This is an affordable product. I have seen reviews on here about having to cut the boot or put the old boots back on.... addressing that issue: yes, the boots are about a 1/4 inch too long BUT I had no problem installing these coil packs. It is not advisable that you cut the boots because of the possibility of water intrusion, and you certainly do not want to use the old boots. I do not recommend  that you cut the boot. You should have no problem installing them. I also recommend that you do all 8 at the same time and you use dielectric grease on both the plug boot and the 2 prong plug that attaches to the coil pack. And of course change your plugs with a platinum core spark plug, Autolite or Motorcraft and set the gap, a 4.6's gap is 54 thousands of an inch, not sure about the 5.4 or 6.8 but it should be the same.
B0018EV9QQ|1|We purchase this for my husband, but on the second time he use this, the pant got all disjointed right in the crotch area, we place the complaint and we have to waist money returning the defective one, we receive a replacement, and happens exactly the same. This is really poor quality made on the pant, and the material seems to be low quality too. I'll not recomend to anybody to purchase this item.
B000EDUUG2|4|Like the expandable handle and that you can hang it up.
B000IY7TWA|5|The mechanic was asking close to 60 bucks for this part plus labor so i went and bought this for my Honda Civic 2000. Did the job myself by watching a couple DIY youtube videos and within an hour had the part on nice and firm. 5 Stars, identical to the stock hose.
B000H94F6E|3|This charger is NOTHING like older type ones.  Its very VERY light and all plastic from what I can tell...so thus it wont be able to take much of a beating or tossing around.  Best to have a plastic container to keep it in if you want it to last.  Charged the battery I needed...but not the way I expected.  Had the battery sitting on a pallet and had to put the negative clamp on a battery jumper cable to work...go figure.. but it did work for the forklift battery after 3 hours on charge.  If you pay under $25 for this...then probably worth it.  But trust me.. for something around 2 pounds and you end up using it a lot, don't expect it to survive much abuse.
B00RA4Q0H6|5|Great quality.  Thanks
B00HSO6EPG|4|easy hookup doing great.
B00A3H61EY|5|merch as promised, fast ship, fit well.
B000ND0WB6|5|Just what I needed. It was cheaper to buy these than to buy a set of clips of the same size.
B000EDOTCS|5|compact!
B00AZQCUUM|5|Clean and does what it is suppose to do.
B000BPLNXC|5|We are a long way from snow weather, but I'm glad I'm ahead of the game with this new snow scraper/brush.  I have always lived in places with bitter winters and I know a good snow tool when I see it.  This is STURDY!  It has a soft rubber grip, an a good long reach for the brush which is important for petite (aka short) girls.  The scraper will be around for many, many winters.  No cracking or chipping from this very thick, hard plastic scraper that is molded to the base, so it won't be detaching over time.  I would put money on having this tool in my trunk a decade or more from now.  Worth its price, but I was a lucky recipient in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B007RVQXRO|5|Worked perfect! They are actually even stronger than oem trunk struts. I have to really try when closing the trunk now.
B0009IQZH0|5|works great for cleaning car
B00HVO6N9A|5|looks good
B00IVPAH9K|5|just what the doc ordered
B00BXLE7M2|5|Mounted on my Kawasaki prairie warn winch. Works perfectly and holds up to abuse. Simple design and easy to rebuild if you wear it out.
B004L2XHJ4|3|It was doomed from the beginning. The running lights never worked. When using the right turn signal, the clear reverse lights would blink along with the red turn signals. However, it worked properly when using the left turn signal. The reverse light also illuminated when applying the brakes while not in reverse, which shouldn't happen. Unfortunately, I didn't realize the problems until I had already installed the light bar. Nevertheless, I used it faithfully for 2 1/2 years. Over time, the clear plastic light covering also began to turn yellow & cloudy.
B000KIMHRQ|5|great deal, thanks!
B00TBHXC4E|4|I have used vinyl cleaner/protector of this brand, previously, which I also received through amazon. That product was designated as an automotive product, while this one is designated as a marine product. I don't own a boat, but I'm sure if it is good enough for marine use than it will work just fine on automobiles, as well. (I don't have any more of the other product, or I would compare the ingredients.) I plan to use this product just as I did the previous one - on the vinyl portions of my vehicle interiors. If I notice any difference in performance then I will edit my review at a later date. The only thing keeping this product from a five-star rating is the price - which is higher than many competitive products on the market.
B002E2UJEE|4|waiting to use it until I get my car rebuilt.
B00OYAKOOE|5|This item fits perfectly, an works very well!
B001AIZ5HY|4|Works pretty well. Not a perfect final product but I am far from an expert.
B00GRHSU5C|5|Great sunshade, kinda diffuses the sun's heat!  My family loves it, we don't feel like the sun is beating down on us and we enjoy riding with the top off our jeep so much more!
B00KB9LH8E|5|Best smell ever!
B001AV4CNO|5|These are a great fit, make the aftermarket rims look great.
B008G2XMD6|5|Works great looks great. Took about30 minutes to replace.
B001V8U12M|5|We bought this for my in-laws and they love it.  They used it for their camper for the first time this last weekend and my father-in-law's back is much happier and so are they.  They even had someone stop and ask them about it.  We also purchased a cordless drill for them to use with it.
B00FP0G5EK|1|Hooked up as intended and the relay buzzed very loudly. Didn't resolve the flickering issue on my 2014 Chrysler 200
B000MTI15K|5|Love it
B00684TAYY|5|Work fine. No problems
B00FALW192|5|If you have just one car to correct paint on, this sample kit is great. You really don't need a lot of this stuff when you use it, so these small bottles go a long way. I used the 32, 34, 36 on a neglected Chevy truck that rarely got washed and was never waxed in it's 9 year life. I wasn't trying to get a $1M finish obviously, but just breath some new life into it. These compounds and polishes worked great. If I spent even more time and put more effort I'd have had a better result, but again, I wasn't trying to get a showroom finish on a 9 year old truck. Paint correction takes a long time, it's not something that's done in an afternoon, so be mindful of that. If you go through all four of these products to correct your paint, you're looking at two full days of work, at least.
B005LD2ONC|1|Bad choice for boating, maybe is good for car but is very terrible for boating. It never adjust correctly, all time have contact's false.
B00TKHT05A|1|Pretty bad quality, the thread came really weak and easily chipped
B00OK702NO|5|This light fit perfect into my 2009 Polaris 850 bumper, so bright!

B00521AHNW|5|This is the Eagle Globe and Anchor I glued onto my Harley leather saddlebags.  Metal and chrome, quality product and looks great!  I have received so many complements on the look.
B00O0A7X9M|5|i love these. decent price. really great smell, too bad they dont last too long.
B008YU5REM|5|Sounds great! PIA to install simply because of the rubber hangers where the muffler attaches
B00ETROLVY|5|Perfect as expected 👌
B00W31VMYC|1|If you ever want to buy a hunk of plastic and stick it on your vehicle so your phone can talk to it and give you absolutely no information at all.. then this is the item to buy.  It should be as simple as plugging it in and downloading the app so your phone can chat with the device, but instead you get messages that it cannot find the proper software protocol.  Of course there is no way to reinstall the software or the firmware on the device itself so all you are left with is a $20 piece of plastic that is USELESS.
B00E6A69NM|5|Thank you
B002ZS4QCS|5|I love these hooks for my car. My kids can keep all their stuff up off the ground and it's great.
B00OVA9FRY|4|My husband ordered these for himself. He ordered large per the size chart because of his thighs. They fit great around the thighs but the belt for the waist could use an extra hole or two because he has a medium waist, so they will slide down some. Other than that he is very happy with them.
B00OQS8GC6|5|The shipment arrived in excellent condition thank you
B001V3B4YG|3|I'm suspecting this is not an original KD glasses. The temples don't seem to be wire reinforced, there was no tag and KD's sticker on the right lens, and there's no  &#34;THE ORIGINAL BIKER SHADES&#34; inside of the right temple and the letters on the left temple and a bit bigger compared to my other KD's.<br /><br />This clear lens/black frame is my third pair, my first two had tags and KD's stickers on the right lens and you can see the wire that supports the temples, and it says &#34;THE ORIGINAL BIKER SHADES&#34; inside the right temple.<br /><br />Fits good though so I'm giving it three stars.
B00BFWK7FU|5|This is a great product. Just what I was looking for. It's comfortable, and the price for the item is well worth it. I give it 5 stars.
B00P3O22MW|5|Works perfectly, made my life so much easier....my not need it all the time, but when I do it's there.
B00RCUX3NW|5|Fit exactly in place of the original part, and should last 10 years like the original as well.
B007ZDGEDC|1|Don't waste your money I could only screw on two of caps. The other two would only screw on half way. I think the threads are messed up
B004AQZCKI|5|Great
B000P4WXHY|4|I have not installed this one yet but previously I have used several of this same GMB pump and each one outlasted the car it was put in (e.g. 100K miles).  I have seen other comments about gasket issues, so I might use an OEM gasket as insurance.  As you probably know, you need to lever this up against the head as you are tightening, to properly seal the outlet.
B000M5W25E|5|see better, drive safer
B000F5LJQO|5|Good price
B00Q2E2QF0|1|Fully charged this before trying- attached to motorcycle battery - no go, won't even jump my bike. Very disappointed and will return for refund.
B001NYYREC|5|Very easy to install. I really like the design.
B00LS7AQSK|3|I was expecting it to have adhesive on the front for outside door window placement instead it the adhesive was on the back. Quite odd! Had to install on inner door instead of exterior door.
B00BMRRXU0|5|could be a little wider
B00D3QUIUA|5|This is a high quality item. OEM fit. The filter is noticeably heavier than the OEM version, which points to more filtering medium and/or more layers as claimed. I wouldn't go back to OEM filter again.
B00IMUCOVS|5|fits o.k.
B009EVMQLW|4|It's awesome,  easy to install and it looks great on my car
B00IS96A04|5|Anothergreatbuy,andtheylookgreat.
B005ZZH7U6|4|I have a 2006 Tacoma and I got these after I had to replace my front mudguards  I really liked the ones I installed on the front, so, I got the ones for the rear, having been about a year in between.  The front ones are smooth like the OEM mudguards.  These new rear ones have a much more pronounced texture on them so they don't really match.  I do like these mud guards, they are a little shorter.  They look great and they are very easy to install.<br /> I don't like the fact that they have texture on them.  That's really my only gripe.  So, I suppose if you're going to change them, change them all at the same time!<br />The first two pictures are the rear ones I just installed, and the last picture is the Husky front mudguard I installed last year.
B008G2XODY|5|Looks and works great..
B001Y93RKQ|5|I bought these because i broke one of my original 2008 Toyota Camry Hub caps. I ordered these which came quick and in perfect condition. These are replicas but look exactly like the OEM ones. They just don't come with the Toyota Symbols. They are easy to install and fit correctly. They didn't break like others say they do! If they break, its probably because of user error! I highly recommend these!
B004RSC5TU|4|This holder does hold your edge and gives a much more factory look over a suction cup.  The included adhesive velcro don't stick that well, I replaced them with higher quality adhesive.
B00RW7W9Y4|5|Very great quality wipers. AERO wipers beat out any other wiper out there, especially in price. They glide across your windshield and do not leave any streaks behind. I would recommend buying these instead of going to the store and easily paying $30+ for a lower quality set of wipers.
B00VDP98U4|5|I actually measured my head, and got a medium.  I'm 5' 2&#34;, about 118#, though I don't know if that affects head size.  Just giving you an idea.  I like that it's DOT approved.
B007XUHF3A|5|Working very good well pleased
B00C29OYP4|1|OMG are these things junk!!!  And why didn't I notice they charge over $10 shipping...  My bad.
B00H79VOXO|5|Great product
B001RVEJSU|4|Ok
B00VU79HMY|5|Good fit for an 04 2.5RS (front passenger side). Protects the engine bay from the spray especially in winter where the slush can cause electrical problem if you are running with a broken liner.
B00K2B802C|5|These brackets fit amazing on my 2014 Cummins! I installed these and added a 20 inch light bar and looks like it came factory. If you decide to get these please have someone with you to help get the tow hooks off. Makes like much easier. This is the way to.
B000C9DZG0|5|Used these drums for a rear brake rebuild on my 2005 Toyota Tundra. The drums come with a heavy coat of rust protection coating oil, so that has to be cleaned off of the inner diameter prior to installation. I also painted them black because they come in bare metal iron finish, so the outside also had to be cleaned of the oil coating.  NOTE: the photo on Amazon of this product is very misleading, looks like someone with greasy fingers handled it. The drums are actually very shiny and have a nice machined looking finish.   The hub bore was a very tight fit over the axle hub, a good thing. The part has all the correct stampings and is the right size. The bolt holes to remove the drum are also the same as OEM, M8x1.25mm. Overall I'm happy with these drums. I bought these drums because I also got the matching AC Delco Professional Durastop shoes.  These AC Delco drums come with a 2 year warranty. Which from my research prior to buying, that appears to be pretty standard across the board for drums.
B00IICYTDG|1|Didn't tighten down
B0064TFH1I|5|So Cute
B00LNOK4E4|5|Using these on a 2013 Ford Explorer for the fog lights which I used to have turned off as they color didn't match my HID's or my Custom LED DRL's Installed these and not only do they match the DRL's but they seem to be as bright as the halogen's. If they last I'll be a very happy camper.
B0014FM6YS|5|very good product and time to deivering
B0009N4F8Q|1|Cheap plastic, rubber inside cap came out after taking it off only one time. Also somewhat wide and rubbed on my brake caliper. Would not recommend.
B007O5GWSS|5|Really simple to use
B0034ZMVKU|5|Easily installed, worked fine.
B000BNS7Y2|5|Used for the first time a couple weekends ago at a trackday where tire pressures are very important. Display is very easy to read and was able to bleed out precise amount of air needed. Recommended.
B00BEDB75E|5|Fantastic product. Exceeded my expectations, especially considering its low cost.
B00BG1HG5Y|5|Recieved it on time and delivery in good condition. Been using it for about 3months now . Still durable, pretty neat, very useful especially since I have to hold on my student ID , keys, and etc. Give it 5 stars on quality, durability, and accurate description.
B00DSD7NRE|5|Was wat i expected
B009AIK1N4|1|Didn't fit my highlander
B00MAV2EZ6|5|Cute gloves-holding up well so far
B00A6AS6LY|5|I bought this product at the recommendation of a YouTube sensation, specializing in instructing us DIY'ers on automotive repair (ETCG).  He was right - this thing is awesome!  Who knew bleeding your radiator could be so easy?<br /><br />If you plan on doing your own coolant-related work, you must get this funnel - it makes life easy!<br /><br />The job is always much easier, when you've got the right tools - this is that tool.
B00157TGXY|5|Excellent product. I am new to Rv'ing and I was informed to purchase some sort of black water tank chemicals. I looked over numerous reviews and ended up here. I have only used them a few times but so far so good. Believe me when I say these work. I destroyed my toilet at least 5 or 6 times this past weekend and we couldn't smell a thing. Not too mention it was like 100 degrees out. If these things can tame the combination of my bio-hazard waste and 100 degree temps you've got a winner in my book. Too bad I can't give them 10 stars.
B0070Y35S8|5|I have no problems with this film. I had a couple spare fixtures from some body work done recently. I applied the film to them, left it in the hot summer car and stretched. Of course you could use a hair dryer, but this worked well as every item, the lens and the film were heated at the same temperature. I will admit however some ignorance. I did not know there was a scratch protectant layer and was concerned when it shrunk. But peeled that top clear layer off and couldn't be happier.<br /><br />This looks really good as well, I have yellow car with black racing stripe and other black accents. I wanted to black out the side orange lights and red reflectors on the back. I will add photos as I do more.
B00UJUURPE|3|they do not tell you which way to load the refills
B004DVG2RC|4|Replaces the rear trailing arms of my accord exactly, except that the bracket for the brake line is a not aligned in the right area with the brake line clip. otherwise, it works well! my car's still running after having them on for 7k miles with them on so far.
B000IYIWDU|5|Pert replacement part.
B00ZQLWN80|3|Bought this to use on our T1N Sprinters (2002-2006).l The dispstick goes into the transmission fine, however it bottoms out before the handle is at the top of the dipstick. So I don't have confidence we're measuring the correct range or that we're getting consistent readings.<br /><br />The is basically a long spring with a plastic indicator on one end and the handle on the other. In that regard it is fine. The indicator piece on ours is a touch crooked.<br /><br />The search for a reasonably price Sprinter NAG1 dipstick continues. The fact that most sellers with these don't have a compatibility list is likely a hint to their confidence in their product...
B001C6L5H8|3|We have replaced the fans in two crown vic's at least once a year, the controllers will overheat if you continue to use the factory wire harness, change the plug next time and it will delay the meltdown another six months
B000CGPJS0|5|Awesome pads so far for the street.<br />However, they rolling to a slow stop they DO squeal a little.
B0050HC3LW|4|Quick shipping. Great buy!
B00CMGAZB4|5|It worked perfect.  Simple bolt on.  I use both stands on ruckus.
B005P29VHQ|5|Fit perfect on our RV.
B008UY1ZM0|5|NOT A BAD INSTALL AND LOOKS GOOD.
B00BR013SK|5|Overall great sound, Gas improvement from 14 mpg to 17mpg city. Shaved off about 1 second from my 0-60.
B003IOKPLO|4|Works very well, very pleased with this item!
B006P5A1G2|5|Fit so perfect!  I love it, thank you so much.  Boy, I can't wait til winter comes.  I can actually breathe in this.  And the eye are perfect.  It is so good to have option on the sizes!
B001O03MKA|5|terrific product made to OE specs! perfect fit and no mechanical issues after 2k miles
B007XE8C74|4|good unit.
B00F3FJZDK|4|Good quality, arrived in a acceptable time. Still working on making the grill but really satisfied.
B00H36XX6C|5|This is amazing! It charges everything lightning fast and the light is brighter than any of our other flashlights. I was really impressed with this. I have portable chargers that I keep in my purse, but they are empty after charging one item. I was able to fully charge my phone and my iPad with the Noco.<br /><br />I would really like a second one to keep in our basement for emergencies. I'm keeping this one in my car, but I also take it into places because it fits nicely in my bag.<br /><br />I will say that I have a couple flashlights that are magnetic and I really wish this had that feature. But overall we will not only buy another if these, but also look into other Noco products. My son is on his way to becoming an Eagle Scout and he's asking for one of these for his birthday. Then my grandpa came by and loved it. I wish the price was a little lower, but for the amount of juice in this battery, it is well worth the money.
B00BEX16MS|5|Fast delivery. They look so nice on my car. I love them!!!!
B00B1ENIVW|5|guuud
B00AL1KJ9K|5|brand new excellent price and quality
B004O7DBM4|3|doesnt come with an on off switch u have to install one yourself some place.  very bright light covers large area,.
B00068OOF8|3|The plates get scratched really easily and the pins start to get hard to pull out after a while.
B00AGAGCRE|5|I have this mounted to the hood of my Jeep Wrangler. It's very bright. Very low amp pull. It's been through several rainy days lately. No moisture at all coming inside the lens. I will buy another one when I fabricate my front bumper. Also .. fast shipping! Overall Im very happy with it!!
B00BFE3H6O|5|Just like the OEM but at a much more afforable price...great product.
B00QMWQMAW|5|great and fit excellent
B000CRDM06|5|Had one of these for years.  Got stolen.  Had to have another.  Working around our boat the need to cut and fit hoses is constant.  This thing just works.
B00LN3QT2G|5|Love these on my Nissan Xterra. Lots of compliments and bright enough lights.
B004GFTC0E|5|I should have taken before and after photos. My wife's 05 Benz head lights were so yellow and opaque you couldn't see the reflectors in the back of the headlights, and we wouldn't drive it after dark. I had check around for replacement headlight assembly's and they ran anywhere from $250-350 each (what you get for owning a Benz). So I bought this kit (nothing to lose, right), read the instructions watched the you tube video, re-read the instructions. So I got out the electric drill and proceeded with the application, 1 hour later one headlight crystal clear. 2 hours later second headlight crystal clear.<br />So I highly recommend this kit, read and follow the instruction and your headlight will look brand new.<br />Don't use a cordless drill, most can't produce the RPM's necessary (1600rpm) or batteries hold a charge long enough for the sanding process.<br />Just take your time and you will get great results.
B004JBI5IU|4|it arrived. it fit. the car started. what more can i say.
B0011NMM2Y|1|didn't fit properly.  Bought two & broke one installing it.  got the second one in but I am sure it will break if I ever have to change a bulb.
B004ANB3PE|1|No instructions on what the clips are for and how to use them. The seat covers don't stay in place. Carpets are fine.
B003BZD08U|4|Works well for the price.
B00U0J3COW|1|Only two of the four lights work!! Great deal
B00CYR3XQK|3|I want to give this more stars but it ripped at the end of the zipper connection and is no longer waterproof. I'm super bummed. Because I really liked the way it looked.
B00O042A46|2|I can confirm it does not fit 2015 Hyundai Genesis sedan v6, filter was an inch longer than original and you will not be able to screw the canister back in place
B0087XOTWW|4|Work great
B007N69IRA|5|This gun is great!  I only spent about $80 for the first gun and regretted it. Spend the money for this gun, its worth it.
B005RA6V2O|1|I bought all four of the Bestem bags for the K1200LT (saddlebag and top case liners, and this top rack bag), and while the three liner bags have worked out fantastic - especially considering price - this top rack bag is unfortunately completely useless in my application.  If your LT has the OEM BMW top case rack (plastic with a chrome top and LED third brake light) this bag has an obvious and fundamental build flaw for that application: The four attachment straps are all much too long to go through the top rack and then attach to their Velcro attachment points on the bag body.  It is not that they are slightly long; it is that to use the bag on the OEM top rack you will either need to be content with using the bag's existing attachment straps and having the bag be extremely loose (like stick your arms in the gap loose), or you will need an outside form of attachment by way of a strap or bungee (kind of defeating the purpose altogether of buying a made to fit top case bag).  Please see the pictures attached illustrating the fatal flaw.  One shows the over-length the straps have when laced through the OEM rack and pulled taut, the other shows how much play there is between rack and bag when the Velcro on the straps and the bag body are pressed exactly on top of one another.
B00RM327NG|5|This thing works great!<br />My wife asked why we never had one of these in the car?  That's because I'm not a fan of the clumsy, flimsy holders that grab the phone.<br />Not a problem with this magnet system.  Looks clean and holds strong on the air vent.<br />I'm hands free and never going back.  Had to send one to my brother as well:)
B00CCYWJQK|5|Has done a great job, no more stinky slinks.
B00KFPDLZQ|5|Brightness just right
B001DC85E2|3|This is ok but not sturdy enough
B0001EXBPQ|5|worked great
B005536S94|3|needed moderate amount of bending actually fit in place on a 94 F250 diesel. Though hit is simpler than getting a piece of tubing and making your own.
B004UHG7Y2|5|Perfect fit for by 2007 Genuine Buddy 125.
B00CO2QQQ4|2|Good price, quality is so so
B009ANV81S|5|no problems-thank you!
B004YLKK5Q|5|Easy install and l love the look
B00RLZC4W4|5|This plate goes very well with a candy apple red vehicle. My SUV looks great!
B002E54VSG|5|After going to the three big box auto parts stores and getting an improper fitting pulley with out any hardware, I gave up for the day. once home looked part up on amazon and presto, the original pulley that comes complete with everything. just unbolt and replace, and you're done. Pulley, bolt w/retainer and the washer plate as well as spacer is all in one box. you cant go wrong with this item, and it will cost about the same as the big auto parts stores for an off brand that won't work.
B00EI6CKVE|1|From the picture I thought this would be around one foot by one-and-a-half feet in size. I should've read the dimensions before purchasing. It's so hilarious but I'd rather people not have to be driving so close to read it.
B003VFCKR2|4|GOOD BUY
B009YRI64C|5|Makes it easier to find in a parking lot.
B0068N1B0Q|1|I had checked it for Subaru Impreza 2013 before buying it but it din't fit.
B00H1I639Q|5|Item came in a box, with all the lug nuts in a bag. Solid steel, nice chrome, and be it durable chrome finish. Awesome product. Huge improvemnt over stock garbage Grand Cherokee lugs.
B000BUU5V8|5|The best I have tried
B000P0TZY2|1|This pan is so flimsy that it will almost bend like a taco when its got 6 quarts of warm heavy oil in it. I was on a roadtrip and was changing my oil in my Grandpa's garage and thought this would be a good cheap tool to complete the oil change, but when i lifted this piece of junk to poor the used oil into the container, the pan bent in half and about a quart of that oil never made it into the jug. The jug was completely covered in oil, the bottom of the oil pan was also covered in oil because it ran down the side where the spout was. That spout rarely pours clean, and certainly not when the pan is at full capacity. I asked the guy at OReillys if I could loan out an oil pan and he sold me this garbage instead.
B000IPAK9S|5|Works as advertised.
B00CUL1YFC|5|Make sure to seal these things up or you will get condensation on the inside, it's cheap to buy at any auto place. Besides that, they look great and are much more affordable than LED, and IMO are less tacky than most LED options out there under $200-300.
B00UHD4HJA|1|The description said 50 stickers but only three arrived.
B00J2EQN06|5|I put these on my 2003 roadking and they are badass . Came earlier than expected and Hill Country is very helpful .I would recommend these to anybody looking to by ape hangers .
B00KN0UOEE|4|good stuff
B003POJ1DU|5|Still use it.. Love it for what it is.. Nothing ground breaking but it works.
B002TLUZGW|1|We live on a small farm my daughter has some livestock goats, chickens my wife whose guide gear baskets I'm reviewing gardens flowers.  These look great when you get them.  Installation pretty easy.  My daughter bought these and I ordered  a pair for my wife's ATV and installed but she was not able to use until the last 2 months the rear basket just came off wore the installation holes on rear bracket.  My daughter's bent in the back and since she used a little more thought maybe it was an anomaly but after mine just fell off I conlude these are pure junk if you plan to use for anything other than looks stay away....can's leave less than 1 star or would
B000BTLMOS|1|I installed these front bushing and after less than a month the bushing are not staying in place, the lips got torn off which left the control arm free to hit the body of the car at each bump, I wont buy these again.
B00ZQXU67I|4|The light looks and works great !
B00993NFR4|5|Received the part on time and it was correct. Car is up and running. Thanks.
B00ELJLV8G|4|Looks good on (2015 Honda Accord EX-L V6 - Black). The white lettering pops, but would have preferred silver lettering. Recommend letting the cover sit in the sun or in a warm area before trying to put on, so not so stiff. Same is true for most slip on covers and has to do with ensuring a stable fit. Grip is good and not slippery, even without textured spikes. I can still feel the steering wheel so the thickness is right for me. I don't like when I can't feel what I'm handling which I've found with a lot of covers. My only real area for improvement is coverage. I suggest adding 1/8&#34; of width to cover the steering wheel to the junction of the spokes. The suggestion is aesthetic, but Honda lovers notice the little things -- that's why we drive Hondas.
B00944QQC4|4|The lights proved to be too small for my application.  However, I did test them and found them in perfect working condition.  I'm sure I'll used them for something else sooner or later.  Great value for my purchase price.
B00QRHDIPY|5|Works perfect
B001GP790W|1|leaves red lint all over my car and does not leave as good a shine as my other one.
B004AGCC1K|5|Item direct replacement for oem. Installed without a problem.Works fine, check engine light off.
B003E3QCZW|1|they said it would fit a 2005 Tundra but they didn't  even took it to a tire place and they couldn't get them to fit unless they deflated the tires and remove them. I ended up going to Pep boys and buying a set that had a retention ring  fit beautifully.  trying to decide if I want to return them as I used rewards and my out of pocket expense was very little
B00K35XHT8|5|works great
B006PAGJXQ|2|I have never had such poor quality from an Amazon  product. Directions for a start, are ultra poor! Assembly requires a workshop of uncommon tools[tapping bit-nut driver-etc]  The handle mount screws  were wrong and I had to use my own Self-tap screws.  The Jumper cables are too small gauge wise and the  clamps are very flimsy! I may sound super fussy because  I'm comparing it to my last unit {Sears Die-Hard]  My fault to try saving a few bucks-Never again!!  Thank you for allowing my Steam Blow-off.
B000BGM7QS|5|What can you say about a flange seal, it either fits or it doesn't. It fits ! ! !
B00BLSSR7I|4|I do like my purchase. They install easily and they look great against my jet black jeep liberty.
B0107O6U3E|4|more like brushed chrome instead of glossy chrome........
B00CDJ8RLU|5|Exactly what I needed. Everything fits nice inside and doesn't come loose.
B0050ZAFIW|5|Work great fast ship, it brighter then my old kit. Still too early to tell how long it last.
B00UZ0OHIQ|2|I purchased this adapter because it specifically states it is compatible with Harry's Lap Timer. That is the only reason I needed it, but based on the product description, I saw myself using it for more than that. Unfortunately the current version of the firmware/software is not functioning properly and does not  integrate with Harry's. This is a known issue with no known date of resolution at this time. The information that the Automatic App provides is not applicable to my situation (for instance, it won't integrate fuel consumption to my car model and since I use it for autocross the calculated driving score is useless since autocross is all about hard acceleration and braking). In addition, the other apps that integrate to the device provide no value to me. I hear it beeping a lot when I drive, but I don't have a way to analyze any of the data is collects to even determine if it is useful information. Very disappointing.
B00CRR5L8U|5|So far everything is great and working like it should be and 1/3 of the price of the parts stores here. I will be back to more pumps When I need them
B009VYWIMO|4|Highly recommended. Easy non-invasive installation due to small connectors and a reasonable sized screen.
B0007VANJ0|5|Easy install on 2005 Grand Cherokee...hardest part was figuring out how to lower my spare!!!  Get a tool for removing the plastic bumper fasteners.  I used pincer pliers but a specialty tool can be purchased for less online or at an automotive store.
B009AKCUCC|4|very satisfied with this item
B00YI3IGA6|4|After trying several other brands, this is the first window shade that actually blocks out all of the sun out of my son's face and keeps the back of the car cool which is a big plus here in Texas during August - the hottest month of the year.<br /><br />It's not the prettiest/stylish looking window shade (literally looks like a huge window pantyhose), but I choose my child's comfort any day over the stylish looks of my car. For those of you that do care, they're super easy to slide on/off of the car window and have survived the rain/etc. Worth every cent.
B001P2GDTE|5|The running boards were shipped in a timely manner. I had them installed and they look great.
B000C55YN6|5|Great product and fantastic price. Replaced mine on a 99 tahoe. Grinding away the rivets on the old one was a pain - an air chisel would be great but not necessary. Had one of the bolts snap when I installed the new one... so obviously not grade 8 (metric 8.8). Amazon had the best price I could find. Very pleased overall.
B00IY229C8|4|Used this for my 26' 2005 Ragen Toy Hauler trailer. Didn't quite fit but I managed to finagle it.
B00UOPW0MW|1|These lights do not work on 2007 Harley's due to  Diffuser In head lamp. Shipping was quick.
B00NBOSI0G|5|Love my New PROGO 3000! Set up was real easy and the tool kit provided with the scooter is very convenient. The instructional videos on the ProGo website are great as well. 5 stars from me!!
B000Q0R4XK|5|Everything I ever needed and more:)
B00BVB7QLS|4|Great product. Holding up very well after nearly a year! Thank you.
B00W8JCE0K|1|Didn't care 4 this.
B000C57XA8|5|Excellent! Went in no problem
B008D6YGE4|5|Update 5/24/16  I have used this rack for just about a year now. On average I use it to transport our bikes about three times per month. In a one year span I haven't experienced any major issues at all. In fact I am planing on using this rack system to transport two MTB bikes with aluminum frames, 26 and 29 er on a road trip total of 24 hours round trip highway driving. I will make another update here when I return.   A few pointers and facts:  I have gone up to 80 mph, very little wind outside, multiple times with both bikes on the roof and haven't experienced any issues. I obviously would not recommend traveling 80 mph if it's really windy out.   So far some discoloration on the rubber parts that meet with bike frame is present but functionally is still just as good.  ------------------------------------------------   I have done extensive research before making the decision to buy this rack. Reviews on here also helped me a lot with making the final decision as well, so thank you.  First things first, I am very satisfied with this product. Here's what I like about it; light weight, simple design, functionality, good paint, and appearance. You can not beat this rack for the price! This rack was exactly and more what I was looking for. Simple and functional to get the job done. I would highly recommend this product.
B00H90NWXG|5|Makes for a much more comfortable ride when the sun is brutal, wish I would have bought this sooner.
B00UO1MBBQ|5|Great product to eliminate the play in the relay link of the steering. Easy to install after you get your pitman arm nut off... I have 170,000 miles on the truck and the steering now feels superior especially on the highway.  Note:  You should replace your pitman arm and idler arm with quality parts while you working in that area anyway.
B00BI94WD8|5|Is what it is.
B00JZQXJ3K|5|Hitch and wiring harness are very high quality. Very easy installation using the instructions that were included. Bolted right up using existing factory mounting holes.
B0022ZSWRO|5|Right mirror fit as good as the left one did. In case you missed my left mirror review----it fit my Honda 900, looks good, stays put, good price.
B000O5DUP8|5|Fits perfectly on my carrier
B005CSQIQK|5|waited a little long for this but i love this product, it works perfectly. ive had no issues with it at all. Im very pleased with this product
B002T49YWU|5|Great price and product
B001P11SCM|5|Replaced an old timed controller. This on is a &#34;set and forget' device that improves trailer braking beyond what was expected.<br />The older 'timed&#34; controllers just don't provide the responsiveness needed.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Worked really well on our camping trip, holds lots of equipment.
B0006SH4HS|5|Great product, could not find this locally
B003XXUWF4|4|Seems to work pretty well...
B000IY4B1M|4|Good quality product for a very reasonable price.  Fits perfectly!
B009902YHO|5|Nice quality pad. Very durable and held up well while polishing an entire vehicle. Light polishing is nearly perfect for this, great for softer clears found on many imports.
B00TZ8HT5M|4|sticker looks good
B00KTIUM88|2|My battery already gone dead are either the replacement keyless is bad
B0002SR0V2|5|As a test, my wife and I both got on it and made whoopie under our Chevy!
B001O7PNS2|5|great
B009UYO3D2|5|Great price and really made the grill stand out  fit like a glove. So easy to snap on a kid could do it. Thanks
B00BKV63J0|3|The windscreen looks awesome. It came in good time and fit perfect on the bike front cowl; but my problem was that it did not have the mounting screws in the package. I had to find other means of sourcing the screws and rubber pieces to mount the windscreen onto the bike front.
B002XAS89A|5|Installed on my 2010 wrx Hatch.Mounted up nicely. The sound is perfect, not too loud or too quiet. Nice rumble. Haven't ran with the silencer yet so. But so far so good
B000C5C9GQ|5|Worked great
B001O0HM4C|5|Very nice wheel locks, they seem quite durable and look good.  The only complaint is that a 6-lug set was not available in black for my vehicle, so I ordered the five-lug and one extra set of four.  Now I have two different lug patterns on my car, and have to store both sockets.
B00TAPLR1W|5|Light weight and easy to install and take out of the truck bed.  NICE!!!

B00S7UIVJ2|5|Works exactly as stated! Have jumped 5 cars, V8 etc and still have not had to recharge the battery. Must have for all vehicles!!! Easily fits under front seats, not waisting trunk space. Great product.
B000CRO4IK|5|This was a gift for my sister who had been looking everywhere for something to put in her car to hold her coins.  She really liked it.
B00M3YBZ32|5|Perfect fit in my 2010 Jetta.  Just be careful prying off the plastic trim to reach it.
B001GEQUSU|5|Works Great!
B00IZCNK98|5|I did get the hose exactly as shown.  We're using it for our RV grill.  Works great!
B009MR7F64|3|perfect
B0010E1LYY|4|works fine.
B0002SR2RY|3|While it easily removed the OPSU out of a LS1, it rounded the tools' teeth.  I will probably be able to use again, but I would suggest something more robust for anyone who regularly repairs OPSU when the engine is still in the vehicle.
B004AIFK9E|4|Fit well,works like it should
B00H6XPZN6|5|These windowshades are awesome? Great price and product!
B00D1CQVIY|5|Excellent  product . ...good seller!
B00E9GVML2|1|To who ever this concerns :    S*** cover tore right away the last one lasted 2 yrs fell apart I live in Cali weather is good I feal for the people back east . I got ripped off !!!!!!
B0063MI7KE|5|Nice
B00F6E5GB8|5|Fits great. Goes on easy. Made with good material.
B000Z0HVHA|4|works well
B0060A91Q8|3|Fit perfectly but I don't understand why it's so expensive
B009K4H42Y|5|5 genuine A01 filters just as described believe these fit everything save for the s2000 sports coupe.
B00514AOCO|5|Great rear passenger cup holder. My wife uses this all the time when we ride, holds large Drinks easily.
B00FRLEQIY|5|Everyone that gets in my car loves it!!
B00852684M|5|Very cool to add to your bicycle
B002HXS9EW|5|Fits great no issues.
B0012S9A5U|5|This is the tool you need if you're doing work on your exhaust system. I'm very glad I bought these pliers.
B005TMIXL2|4|Guards fit nicely where I placed them. There were no directions so I You Tubed placement.  I ended up doing it different by adhering them to the painted portion of door and not the rubber trim around the window. So far so good on staying. Will report back if not.
B000EDQR50|5|Needed replacements was easy to replace.
B002ZHDL2A|3|It looked great until I tried to fit it on my passenger seat.  It was unstable and felt like it would shift easily,  I used the nylon mesh straps that came with the product but it still did not feel stable.  I returned the ButtyBuddy and ended up using a simple neck pillow over the passenger seat and so far that as worked out well and also less costly.
B00HQNXU2O|2|Too short for literally anything you'd want it for. It is NOT 132 links, it's 132 pins which is 66 links.
B00412YT8W|5|Received on time. Came with good instructions and was very easy to install. Window is working great!
B00KKNNZ6I|5|Very satisfied
B007Z8VG30|5|Have the letters on my gun cabinet at the moment! Looked very nice and the lettering looks fantastic in the greekish style. A must for a gun owner or a modern patriot!!
B000J42QOU|5|Fits great and looks even better
B00192JG9O|5|Very nice and sturdy flag pole. We needed an rv flag pole that was portable and sturdy. It doesn't work under a tire as described because most trailers now have a slide out on one side and an awning on the other, we have a 5th wheel and it works great mounted under one of the feet of our king pin stabilizer
B000RTU06S|5|Works great
B00X04JRMU|5|awesome stuff to use on a well painted RV. i have used it about 7 times and everytime it comes out great!!! I always get lots of compliments
B000CAINEI|5|Nice quality
B0002NIK3E|5|nice and easy to fit
B007UTFJHS|5|Nice sealed locking relays, had trouble with others unplugging, these won't, fast shipper  highly recommended!
B000CGD0SQ|5|Belt fit right on 10 minute job.😁
B00GSAUHB8|5|Love it! The car stays much cooler!
B00EBZQ26Q|4|My only issue with this ribbon is that its backing is not in the form of the ribbon, but rather in a square. And so, you can see the outline of the square. I altered mine by using a razor blade and carving the ribbon out of the square. If the backing was cut to trace the edges of the ribbon, it would be top notch!
B0015C8HT8|5|Used with luggage on a trip to Germany, and many times since.
B008D8I60W|5|This is my second Torc T-50.  For my head these are the best fitting 3/4 helmets I have found.  Also really like the feel of the helmet liner, it's very comfortable.  Mine was an XL not a M like the review seems to point to.<br /><br />Update:  for me, the Rebel Flag was a little too much over time.  A can of flat black Plasti Dip and problem solved.  In the future, if I want to go back to the flag again or paint another color, just peel the Plasti Dip off and start over.
B00684TAYY|5|Everything is awesome! Just follow the steps left by other reviews here. Like to add that you have to be outside of the car when you test the remote.
B006UH59D0|5|Light weight and very strong!
B0048EHTHG|4|Good fit in form and function. Great value compared to dealer OEM price.
B00B17E0SE|3|They're okay. Cheaper quality than oem, but they work
B00YGOB690|2|Will not fit the cruise control
B00DILSQQ8|5|I just recently got the new 2015 Ford F-150. I already had the standard size from my trade-in, 2008 Honda CR-V. I knew it was too small for the new windshield I have, and so, I purchased this size. I make it fit, but maybe the better size to go with, for the F-150, would have been the Jumbo. At any rate, it gets the job done just as efficiently as my previous one. Smiles all around.
B0002U2V1Y|5|Love this product. Use it on all my cars
B005Y38S3E|5|Way too expensive but got the job done.
B00H573MO2|5|works fine for me
B006N99T5Y|5|Fit perfict and was a better replacement.
B00HFDC8EQ|5|made the repair easy
B00JXYKJ5A|2|Light was perfectly packaged but the reason for the low rating is because of 2 things:<br /><br />For 2013 Camaro 2ss/rs<br />1)When intalled the DRL lights, it didn't fit inside the housing.<br />2)Light only lasted for 4 months.<br /><br />Not worth the investment
B008CLNYPC|1|I have a 1978 CJ-5.  I had purchased the Smittybilt 2798 Jerry Can holder and mounted it on a Smittybilt tire carrier mount.  I thought this device was flimsy, but thought it would past muster considering all the great reviews.  I guess most don't live where I do, and if you live in an area with nice paved roads, then this would should work fine for you.<br /><br />But this this past weekend, I made my way up to the Flat Tops Wilderness here in Colorado ( a very beautiful area for camping and four wheeling), and the roads/trails are only what I would term moderately rough.  Well on my way into the Flat Tops on a  very good road, the bracket that holds and locks the can, broke on the Smittybilt Jerry can carrier, and my Jerry can filled with gas bounced off totally unbeknownst to me.  Upon arrival at camp and discovering it was gone, I did back-track to try to locate the Jerry can (fillled with 5 gals of hi-test gasoline), but to no avail.<br /><br />Moral of the story, my initial gut reaction that this device was rather flimsy was totally right on.  I am out a gas can, and five gallons of gas (and I had not even made it to the side trails.  My advice...  look further or fabricate your own).<br /><br />Jim
B00E9GWAWC|5|california sun is brutal on covers and equipment. Take your pick, expensive Rv roof repairs or figure on buying one of these every year. This is my second cover from this brand.<br /><br />In the previous purchase I purchased the cover with the best warranty possible but discovered that they will fail in this sun loving weather every year anyway. Better to buy the cheapest cover and expect to toss this cover at each season.<br /><br />The quality of this cover is more than adequate to survive the year. Protects the pain and roof.<br /><br />And this cover is much lighter than the expensive canvas covers that fail at the end of season just like this one.
B000SL4A84|4|This is a good &#34; all around&#34; first aid kit. Should be good for most daily miss-naps.
B00ZGGORFM|5|Awesome alarm for the price. Would recommend.
B000CPCC4U|5|To install, fill with grease, take a 2' piece of 2x4 and use it to position the grease cap in place and rest on tire so you can hold it all with one hand and then smack the sh** out of it with a 24 oz. hammer. then laugh as the grease squirts out of the vent hole....
B0049MVDB0|1|It might be a good tow hitch, but I wouldn't know since it doesn't fit a 2014 Toyota Corolla
B0006302OU|5|It  makes the engine run smoother .
B0009PBAMS|5|This was probably the easiest install I have ever done. It took longer to figure out how to route it to the back of the truck from the front battery connection. Winch is mounted on a trailer and the connection is smooth and quick when needed.
B00IJEZ33S|1|Bulbs were blown
B0040TC2WG|5|Worth it
B0023VE104|5|Lens fits perfectly and the vendor deserves top rating.  They quickly corrected a problem.  Good product, great service.
B003ZWZ7VM|5|Exact fit for my Jeep Wrangler Sahara 2015.
B009DJZCPC|1|Product did not fit, but they did refund my money. This only fits 1996 Honda accord 2.2L engine model. Will not fit the 2.7L engine model because the fenders are longer by 3 3/4&#34;.
B00S1QX68I|5|GREAT BUY...  And it works...  saved a lot
B004RCQTIY|5|Exactly as advertised! Great purchase.
B00LID9CCU|5|Very satisfied
B005644G7I|5|Perfect fit in 06 Pathfinder. Brighter than originals and easy to install.
B001VXU0F0|3|did not work but you get what you pay for
B0002STRPO|5|Absolutely perfect, exact part/tool needed for my 78' FJ40. A must have from a top notch vender.
B006BAQ6Y2|5|Perfectly well and very good
B00W7PP47K|4|Good
B0009V1WS4|5|Nice,solid,and secure, held my carrier attachment in place.
B00TE3ZNN8|4|Good radio. No issues thus far. Great looking in my antique Beetle.
B007VIGCJW|1|This stuff is useless. Did not seal 2 pipe plugs in a filter head with #2 diesel. Cleaned the holes with brake clean and paper towels, applied the dressing to the plugs, tightened down, let it sit overnight, truck wouldn't start without eyther. later removed the fittings, looks like diesel dissolved the blue goop, no residue at all. Use the Thread sealant with PTFE for fuel or oil
B000CSPI3E|5|Got my mower up and running again for cheaper than Home Depot.
B00TK23MZY|5|Received many great comments. Sharp looking and does its job.
B000JFHNG0|1|I share comments previously left about the quality of this item--bad.  This product is very cheaply made, the low side auto-connect coupler barely works, but the high side won't connect properly on three different vehicles.  I was a mechanic for 20 years and have a snap-on set for the old R12, but I wanted to get a new set for my vehicles that now have 134a.  I didn't expect this to measure up to the snap-on set, but I did expect it to function properly. Very disappoint. Could have spent $30 more and got a better set instead of now having to spend $50 on new couplers.  Don't buy this crap.
B000P58DMC|5|Fits perfectly on my '96 Ford Ranger 3.0l V6. Just remove old one and install the Accel Coil in the same bracket. Now the engine idles smoother and gives better mpg. The OEM coil gave about 24 mpg average when monitored with a BAFX OBD2 blue tooth scan tool. After installing the accel coil the mpg went up to 29.8 mpg. This was monitored on the same route for both situations. This product is an easy install and gives you extra benefits for your car.
B002WP362U|4|Does what it's supposed to do, but expensive for what it is and I really didn't use much of the roll.  I used it on the roof for extra hold but found I didn't really need it for most other parts of the car since the dynamat was either behind a panel, MLV, or both.  This is just aluminum tape, not sound deadener.
B004W0QIXM|5|They are great to use. Smaller than I thought they'd be. but they still work out.
B008KV4KP2|5|Great replacement pump fair price!!
B005BNP7UO|5|Neat devise,
B00GXRG3DW|5|Amazing microfiber towels. The window towel is awesome, gives a streak free clean. The two edgeless towels are perfect for final buffing and cleaning after waxing. The two dual pile towels are great for general cleaning and drying, and the really thick, heavy towel is great for drying and waterless car washing. Superb products, so much so that I bought a second set. I washed them before use as directed, and be advised that the black towel is not color fast so the white towel came out gray. Not a real big problem for me. Just awesome towels, make sure to take care of them. I never took care of my microfiber towels properly before, until I watched some detailing videos on YouTube, that's why I got these. Awesome towels, highly recommended.
B00AGKTEQA|5|Fits great, looks great and is saving my dash.
B007QYEC8Y|5|Quite handy kit...
B00H9KUV12|5|It works as described. Thank you again for the quick delivery.
B00H8EEWUA|5|It works flawlessly on my 2013 Prius. Very sturdy tool, good fit and finish.
B00IGU9S8Q|2|Very small and weak. Takes a long time to top off a tire.
B00GU9ZPKK|5|Perfect replacement for my 2007 CTS.
B00PNV68VG|3|Front seats went on with a a problem, back seats on the other hand were a little more difficult.  But you get what you pay for!
B005SUVZKQ|5|Worked great could have pulled off stator without it.
B00LWTAUN0|3|Great
B0028081GK|5|Owned this for well over a year and it works perfectly, nice study box, very pleased with it.
B000VS8DZU|5|Like it
B0077T6GGO|5|Great helmet for the price! Very comfy for all day riding
B003ITFAJG|5|I knew I would probably see a difference in HP. I always have with these. I got it mainly for the MPG boost, but is yet to be seen. I just put in this morning.<br />I wanted to post this because I I have a 2014 Diesel Cruze and I know there are a lot of us out there. When I took out the stock filter, I just could not believe the difference! I don't know who designed the stock filter but they should have their head examined- a piece of felt right across the bottom! Talk about air restriction! So to all of us Diesel Cruze enthusiasts, I am posting this as you may want to spend the $50 just for better air flow as it appears the stock one literally chokes it off. PS I can sqawk the tires now from a dead stop until the T/C kicks in due to the added boost. Due to that and it being a diesel, I wouldn't be surprised to see an additional 3mpg. I am taking a long trip soon and heard fuel prices are rising again so I hope to report an addition of at least 1mpg. At any rate, fun to to drive before, really fun now!
B0058TF7EM|4|Fits well on top of the car ....
B000C9QQSE|5|great product great price
B00AJOBA9M|4|Fit right on my 03 RM 85. Great replacement, easy install.
B0009V1WS4|3|Unfortunately, this lock does not fit my 1.25&#34; hitch receiver.
B001UCCNES|3|Easy to install.  Working well.
B00DBN5QSY|3|to small to cover my existing centers.
B00ZTNZISW|5|Thanks
B001P2FD6I|3|I've installed 2 Recon kits and I like them, but I thought I would give Pacer a try. Their product looks great, but they came with the wrong color LED's that are an illegal cab light color in my state and the mounting screws were 1/2&#34; to short. After I called Pacer, they gave me the runaround and customer service was horrible. Eventually, i just purchased LED bulbs from superbriteleds and they look great!<br />Installation was pretty similar to Recon lights(except the wrong screws and bulbs in Pacer's kit) and they light up like a Christmas tree with the led flasher I wired into them.
B002ZTMG6U|4|Custom fit is over blown, these sag on the sides and feel REAL flimsy. Still cover my floor and provide protection from summer messes, we will see how they do this winter.
B00VT2Y2WA|5|Not installed yet. Did a bench test and they work great.
B0009A2NTM|5|After some research I found that this was the best product for my car. In using this on my car, I can say that I was more than pleased with this product.
B000B8JUAW|5|This locking gas cap works great on my 2015 Toyota Tacoma 4.0 liter V6 4X4 truck. I've had it in my truck for about two weeks and have had no problems with it.
B007IODAOY|5|GREAT
B00FSDFKAO|5|Great fit and it looks great!  It has a slightly darker silver color than the switch on the passenger side of my Vibe, though.<br /><br />Be sure to keep your old screws when installing it.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|So far so good.  Especially for the price.  I did read the reviews on what went wrong with others and upon arrival, inspected the item well.  I noticed that the sides of the lenses are very well sealed, but the top and the bottom are not.  There seems to be an air gap.  I sealed those areas with clear silicone and so far, it has maintained the water out.  This is after several very wet weekends.  We'll see how they do in the long run.
B005ZI075A|5|fits my 2006 tundra perfectly
B00VGL6TSO|5|Looks well build, and fits perfectly my hitch.
B001NZUFN8|4|Fit my 2009 Honda CRV vent and holds my Samsung Note 4 and GFs sunglasses.   EZ to install and doesnt flop around too much.  Would buy again
B00Y2EFW0S|1|Didn't fit my 2015 2 door. I think it arrived bent or the product just came defective.  Customer service wouldn't work with me.  I would not recommend.  Follow up: It has been a month and my problem is still not resolved for the bent guards.
B006Q7C7L6|2|Disappointing results. Placed in a sunny window, this device did not keep my Honda Accord charged during the cold winter months. I would have been better off just disconnecting the battery cable.
B000GVIL3Q|1|Was so tigtgh we couldn't get on the PWC we tried several times until one of the seams ripped.
B009WQ3K7I|5|Best floor mats ever. Soft not stiff. So they keep their shape better over time.
B00BO9EODK|4|appeared to be from some old stock, but working so far
B008I62UE2|5|Excellent communication, item arrived quickly and as described.
B008HO0I8A|4|Just what I wanted, and lasted quite a while. 2 years later the heart has been power washed off by rain and car washes, but the rest looks great.
B008G3KCHE|2|Not very bright lights. Would I order again from them I don't think so!
B005PZMLDY|1|Wasn't happy with the feel or the quality or the manner in which they looked installed, sent back
B002R0B8IE|5|Can hardly tell difference from the old one
B000X42QJG|3|I am still waiting for my refund because this was not the right fit for Mit-Endeavor and I specified exactly what kind of a vehicle I had.  Hopefully, I will hear something soon or I will start filing complaints.
B001C97UWO|5|Fits like oem on my 1996 Nissan 240sx
B00CIMSGSG|5|The price was right (a friend in auto repair could have gotten them for me at his price which was twice this price) and with a flat head screwdriver I had them changed out in five minutes. My hatch opens and closes perfectly.
B007JMTS14|5|I purchased a 2500 watt pwr inverter and ordered battery quick connect very well made went together well I soldered the connections works very well for what I needed.i will be ordering more to make jumper cables
B00151G54S|5|fast shipment, parts fit perfectly
B00GZHWXCA|5|I ordered 4300k to maintain a stock appearance. This did the trick and they don't tend to stick out as much as the other colors might, yet I have a decent amount of light to drive by. Five stars is for my initial impression. I may update as my time with them increases.
B0083W18IU|5|perfect
B00JVI00CU|4|very nice already installed it in my car at dhaka, bangladesh
B000CP2KJW|5|Strong clip
B0053P69IO|3|I bought this hitch to fit our 2011 Toyota Sienna XLE. The installation didn't look very complicated so I figured I could handle it myself. I was able to make the cutout in the plastic undercarriage cover easily without removing it, as other users had suggested. Popped off the screw hole covers and slid the hitch into place but could not push the hitch up to align the bolt holes with the brackets. I gave up after a couple of hours of frustration and took it to a local rack outfitter. They looked under my Sienna and said this particular undercarriage cover has a hump, toward the tail of the van, that runs the width of the van from driver side to passenger side. The cover is not flat as the CURT installation videos show. This hump prevents the hitch from mounting properly. They said sometimes they are able to just shove it into place, but often end up removing the cover completely.<br /><br />They ended up cutting a hole the width of the cover to remove the hump and then were able to install the hitch.<br /><br />Seems fine now, but I wish the instructions were clearer about this issue.<br /><br />On top of all this, the hitch arrived heavily scratched and banged up due to lack of any sort of packaging. The product description says the item ships bare, but they could at least wrap the corners in some cardboard and padding to prevent this kind of damage. I would have returned it if not for the fact that we needed to use it immediately.
B0009WK6J4|3|Work very good for me....Thank You....!!!!!
B00IGCV4AE|5|OE replacement part fits and works as expected.
B00VVFF93G|4|Motor arrived in 2 days, fit perfectly, easy to install once I found instructionl. My only criticism would be that there are absolutely no installation instructions, since I am not a trained mechanic I had to find a DIY video to guide me through.
B00ITNLD4W|1|Works great, but quality is doubtful:  Completely fell apart after two months of very ordinary use.  Would recommend spending a little more to get a good wheels and rims brush.
B000W0RQ8C|5|Love this lock. Strong and lockable.
B00NPPNKTU|5|Bought because old headlights were real FIM. Put them in the corners on my van. Can see very well now. Well worth the money. And save the trouble...buy a harness with it
B00SH33WJ8|5|excellent product
B0028ZKMM6|5|Used for my Stebel horn, good instructions for installation.
B000C55YU4|5|Moog, about the best there is. Great quality and cheaper than the local parts store. Freeze it the day before install and it will slide in a bit easier. In removing the old one I broke a HF bolt joint press... a big hammer does the job better, just support the lower arm with a jack or stand. I did the job on a 99 Tahoe.
B0002UEN1U|5|I used this to seal leaks in plastic and it works really well.
B00842A7F4|5|Several of my caps were worn here and there and I was able to get a full pack of these at the fraction of what he originals cost.
B00NOG0PNO|4|First set outer lights broken. Contacted amazon and sent new ones quickly. New ones work great.
B00029XGQ4|4|Horns are loud just what my wife needed on mail route
B004AFTDC2|1|these cups were bigger than expected! and the caps didn't close correctly, you could not drink from it without getting your drink spilled on you. Also it came later than expected! never repurchasing.
B007HRTM94|5|Good instructions and easy to replace.
B000CB69ZW|3|this is not a universal as described- according to my mechanic this could ot be used, and is too puny even in hawaii. I'm sure it can work, but i do not know for what.
B00E9D4NES|4|Great fit.. alignment off but not by much at all I would recommend this product definitely adds to the car. And comes with 1 extra back and front
B011NNZYJE|2|Edges were too fat to fit into any panel seams I needed to remove on a 2016 WRX.
B00BDOCWMQ|5|This wheel cleaner is amazing. After trying *literally* every wheel cleaner available at my local automotive shops, I found the Sonax wheel cleaner. This is truly the first cleaner that i have used that is really &#34;no scrub&#34;. The one caveat my previous stamens is that you have to stay on top of your wheel cleaning. If you don't wash your car for 500 miles, you will have to scrub a little, but not much. It has been safe to use on my BMWs and has not discolored the wheels as other cleaners have in the past.
B004SMGAJ6|5|Received it fast and fits like a glove.  Convenient having the two most popular size towing balls affixed to the hitch and having such a good range of movement up and down
B00KCR7PM2|5|Exceptional quality and value purchased a second set after receiving the first Highly recommended seller and product.
B003FG4SKE|2|Wish that I would have read the reviews before purchasing.  Bright on high beam, worthless on low beam. I'm considering eating the cost and putting the original 9008 lights  back in.
B005ESEH1G|5|very nice
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Excellent product very bright !
B00GD8OL62|5|Great white color. Hopefully these bulbs will last longer than the Sylvania bulbs I had previously.
B00V30J86I|2|trying to figure it out.
B00A2DWD7S|5|The material used in the making this cover is awesome, protects good against weather elements
B00OQG4NV6|1|The idea of this item is neat, However there was a dead spider in light. I was afraid to use this because i don't if the spider could be dangerous to my  family and I. May try getting them again one day we shall see. I was able to try this in exchange for my honest review.
B00ZGNGV6I|1|My matts came in soap in oil. I have tried almost everything to get the oil and smell out of the matts.
B00KVP2GO2|3|I will say it works, but not without some effort. Directions don't exist more or less, it comes with a paper that tells you to bolt it up and use it, I am not joking or being sarcastic, that is all it says, not how to put it together or how to use it, most of the words are also misspelled. I have used many before so I knew where to start and what to do, others might not however. The holes cut for the lugs are out of shape and not clean at all, I had to open them up with a dremel just to get them over the threads of the studs, once I did this and got them over the studs, I found that the center hole for the hub was to small (hub bore on my car is 67MM), so I had to open that up so I could get it to seat all the way and flush. The rear bolt and washer on the threaded shaft that is used for adjust pressure is also poorly made, being that it is a plain thick washer and not a bearing etc, the nut and washer lock up and spin them selves off the shaft causing the tool to no longer function, I used some brake lube between the washer and the nut to allow the washer to spin without backing off the nut as well.<br /><br />With all that said, once this was done, it worked well, just like any other roller I used. That is however allot of work and time just to get the thing to work as it should, maybe I had a bad example, though I would not buy one unless you are ready to put in the extra time and work to get it to function as it should.
B00K02VI5O|1|Poor fit and finish..you get what you pay foe
B00M47QLNW|5|Not a big fan of this style of ac compressor but it is what i got to work with.  Fit my 2005 ford freestyle and has held for the summer.  So far so good.
B000TYONCI|2|Great idea. Bad product. The teeth are very brittle and as others have stated. The metal retaining ring pops off and shortly after the cable will also. I bought a second one thinking that maybe it was installed incorrectly the first time. I examined it closely and made sure that I had installed it right. The metal retaining ring is the problem. It doesn't stay in place. I would think it should snap in place somehow but it does not. I even tried installing it different ways. It has two different sides to it. I did not want to spend another $20 plus dollars so I re-installed it and epoxied it around the ring and retaining teeth, covering the entire surface while making sure I didn't get any on the cable eye hole. There are no moving parts on that side so I am sure it will be fine.  As long as the ring does not fall out it will stay in place... Good luck as the other alternative of an entire set of cables is expensive and very labor intensive.
B00I87BXX0|5|worked great
B00P1HQKVK|4|A good unit- for the price.  As mentioned in other reviews there were no installation instructions.  Not a big deal as it's pretty simple how it works.  It took a little dialing in to get the door latches to work properly and a little padding to reduce/eliminate the rattling.  Now that I've got them dialed in they work well and are definitely a good value if you don't mind tinkering to get them right.  They are very sturdy, fit well, and have a nice look and overall design.
B008FZCXC0|5|Fit my 2005 Grand Cherokee better than the originals...the heads have a larger diameter which hold the hood liner more securely.  Way better price than from the dealership!  Changed my windshield washer nozzles in no time with these because I didn't waste time (futilely I might add) trying to save the old, brittle, ones.
B0023VKXT2|5|Thanks!
B00CXB84N4|5|This is great! We have used it in the backyard and taken it camping. It is great for roasting marshmallows to make smores!
B004GZSHSC|5|easy to install did it alone. Actually mounted right to the old brackets.. did have to bend the bracket a touch to get this to bolt.. but was quick and easy...
B00M9NBD5W|2|Clear coat side didn't work well
B001C6N7M4|5|Great replacement.....good price!
B00XZ78W3C|5|Very easy to install and seem very good quality.  I used these on my Chrysler Town and Country minivan and they work great.  I use bike carriers on it.  My only gripe is that one end on one of the bars came apart in the box, and I can't put it back together the way it's supposed to be.  I did find a way to make it work, but it involved more tools and made it harder to use.  If not for that, I love these and they were a great buy!
B00M3ILR5Y|5|look great - need to make sure to adjust the tightness so the fit snug!
B008EJPHES|5|Item received as described in good condition.
B00ZS275QC|5|The seat covers fit our 2013 F150 Ford pickup perfectly.  We are very happy with them, the look and the fit.

B002OP1G5C|1|Mine had a bad weld, noticed leaking exhaust  after riding for 3 hours powersport superstore and pro circuit had a good customer, not now return and refund not offered, only repair and I would have to cover shipping.would not use these companies again
B0000AYC87|5|Perfect fit. Used a board and heavy hammer. It went in tight enough to feel confident it wouldn't fall out, but not so tight I thought I was going to deform it. Works very well.
B00A2DX3O0|5|Very excellent product. Good investment
B000EDUTNQ|4|Worked Perfectly
B000O5DUP8|5|Fits perfectly and works great.
B000G2OY7M|5|Good product-Quick and easy to install with good instructions
B000CITK8S|4|Keeps my motorcycle battery up just fine.  Thought it could've been a bit cheaper though.
B00KLKVML0|5|Great replacement parts. Had some questions and received quick responses. Recommended seller. Only issue was the throttle cable mount screw hole was not threaded, and threw me off. It's a free mount system, just remove mount from cable, and install through neck. Works great.
B0070Y35OC|5|It was easy to apply on the windows - though I was doing for the first time.. Good to get this and try instead of spending 10 time the money to get it done from a Car mechanical shop.
B00NGONUSG|5|it was perfect fit and easy installation. its been on a month with no issues
B000S2MP08|5|Worked as expected
B00348B6TY|5|I love this decal! It is the perfect image to help promote my business endeavors. It says it all, in one image...
B00NQ11TZK|4|Works As advertised! It's easy to create rubber molds now.  The hard part is to actually just get create the mold itself since it's so sticky!
B004HCOE7W|5|nice
B004AIIVUO|5|it works on my 2003 lincoln navigator driver side door, the reprogramming of the window was easy took maybe 5 min but i did have to do it twice. googled &#34;Window Motor Initialization&#34; , I didnt have to deinitialize first,took a chance and it worked.
B00EEMJBYQ|5|Looks great in the back of my Pacifica.
B0023WIUCS|4|They worked great easy to install and are super bright
B004ETGQKG|5|excellent
B00WDSVEE8|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!  I was having issues hitting the ball square as I am an avid softball player.  Wearing my prescription glasses during sunny days produced way too much glare.  Started using these wonderful clip ons and I went 5 for 5 in my first game!  Love them!  Had the same issue driving with my prescription glasses, just too much glare, so now I use these and I can see everything now.  I feel much more safe driving and can read the road signs now!
B005JZQU2S|4|Looks nice, I hope it lasts.
B00IEF49QE|1|I have owned bmw's for the past 15 years .. ive delt with countless dealerships and this is by far the WORST EVER .. ive been on HOLD for the PAST hour .. everytime i call back KAREN answers and puts me right back on hold. .. my package arrived OPENED with only ONE GRILLE ...  and i cant soeaknwith anybody regarding it
B008BE02GO|5|Brought life back to my stock headlights. I can see. Whiter light instead of the previous yellow. Not hid's but for the price i am totally happy.
B00GHT9GMQ|5|Works great.  Exactly like OEM.
B00DMHS1JK|1|These bulbs are complete garbage. I had one bulb burn out after 30 days (terrible MTBF for an LED bulb). Ordered another set, and now I've got one that cuts out intermittently. Spend a little more money and get a quality product.
B008R15IT2|5|This item was shipped quickly and works great
B0002JN27W|5|No worries here.
B00K7DX8VI|5|Great thanks
B00832OKF8|5|Work as advertised.
B0055QOKC8|5|Product arrived as shown in great condition!
B00S5AB54W|2|Ability to clear several codes within the Land Rover system, however it does not so much more than a standard OBDII scanner. I bought this with hopes that I would be able to reset my oil service light with no luck. I am refunding it and putting the money towards a better unit that can do everything that I need.
B000NCS7GE|5|Clear view adapters are a must to give you a visual, to know when your tank is completely empty. Also the 45 degree angle provides for better alignment when connecting the drain hose for improved drainage. Some trailer configurations are such that you have to reach back under the trailer when making connects. This adapter makes it easier for connections.<br />RP
B00CU4J4WY|5|Fits and looks great!  Well worth the extra money!
B00T94BKFW|5|Definitely worth the money, they light up the night
B000C8T96Q|5|Work as advertised.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Must buy for anyone in a really hot climate. Keeps the kickstand from sinking into tarmac when it gets soft which prevents the bike from falling over. Excellent product.
B00SL0T9M6|4|Works just like it should.
B00IZ9Z3ZA|1|Was not happy at all there were all bent and one was scratches on it. Not happy  so give no stars

B00P1GDDLG|5|A top notch product, that is superior in everyway.
B00IGYZNPY|5|Great look and Price for this Decal.
B009SHJH00|5|Intense green color and more than bright enough to replace those old wedge-base incandescents in dashboards or other indicator use. As with other  LEDs of this type, remember to try flipping it over if it doesn't light when first inserted.
B000NK7992|5|Gaining power at take off that I can feel it, but also burn more fuel than factory one. I like it
B00H15WHU8|5|No complaints..<br />Eccellent..
B000M5Y72A|5|Nice and bright at a good price.
B001715RQS|5|WORKS ON MAZDA 3 2015 (NON BOSE)<br />It was easy to install simply removed the Glove Compartment plugged it and installed a SSL LOPRO10 Amplified Subwoofer System 10-inch 1200-watt under the front seat and now I have Lots of bass sounds amazing!
B001O0TZ8I|5|Best brake pads I have used, very nice, stops quick, quiet and very responsive.
B001GBN53Q|5|Great product no problems definitely a HP gain. Also have cold air intake, programmer and exhaust . I can tell a big difference with all together. l suggest getting all 4 if you can, and if you get the throttle intake go ahead and buy a new TPS sensor, really a pain to get old one out.
B00DQUA3IK|5|Great
B000TV6DLU|3|The end seem to get ratty pretty quick. It doesn't keep its soft profile for long. The plastic shield around the shaft is nice and it does the job, but I worry about swirls with the condition it's in. Washing it didn't help.
B0052FRQJ6|5|Good price. Fast shipping. Fit to my car.
B000BTF5BY|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B00DMTTSIQ|4|The fit is very nice.  They are not as heavy duty as I was imaging, but still very nice.
B000C2YCKA|5|Gates makes good quality parts. Fit just fine. Replaced both belts while replacing the water pump.
B00QIVTKUG|5|Excellent!!!!!
B000BYD4QM|5|This product was easy to install and I was pleased with the quality.
B00CFM9QLA|3|It hold quite a bit of stuff, but flimsy unless full.
B00BTLEJAQ|5|Excellent !! Fast. Good and fantastic fit on my car
B00HZT57UM|5|Very high quality decal and easy to put on. My husband has it on the rear window of his work truck and he loves it
B00YOUDIG0|5|Looks great and reasonable price!
B00HYLZVCA|4|Not exactly the same as stock, but pretty darn close. Quality seems fine, made it through rainy season with no condensation inside.
B00F4MQJ5O|1|Same as LUMITEK for 57.86
B00HVHF6AE|5|rather than have to purchase a key remote - got one of these because plastic on remote had cracked & repairs weren't holding up.  Didn't want to drop the remote somewhere so this guard was recommended to me.  Perfect solution fp a couple of $$
B00EP3PV4S|5|They are beautiful for the money.  I love them.
B00AZWOZHC|5|Works good
B001C6Q8D4|5|easy to install
B00N58VRYC|5|Sea Foam has a great reputation and works as advertised. It is great stuff for a periodic maintenance on your gasoline engines. I use it regularly and have yet to be disappointed with the results. Get some and use it -you will not be sorry.
B000CSZGDQ|1|Dorman has good products, Took over two weeks to get here, I refused shipment
B000NPGX3U|5|Works great in tight spaces. Durability TBD.
B004A2YCBW|5|fast shipment, parts fit perfectly
B00EWX4386|5|Came in before expected which is always a plus, great feel, great weight, far better than the stock shifter and would defiantly recommend.
B00SBZRKEU|5|Love it !!
B007OW62V8|5|Easy to install.  Just follow some Youtube tutorials.  The most difficult part is lifting the hood of the car.  Why pay the dealership to do it??
B0055B0EFK|5|Great product super fast shipping
B005SB0JJS|5|Really dressed up my Jeep! I can crack my windows and not worry.
B00KCAYK0Y|1|Don't waste your money here if these is for use outside.  ANYTHING to clean the glass will smear the ink; Windex, alcohol, some soaps.<br /><br />Yes, they sent me a picture of their ink cartridge marked &#34;solvent ink,&#34; but it appears to be an aftermarket cheap ink.  They should be coated or laminated then.<br /><br />Anyway, there ARE decals on here that are truly outdoor ink--I have bought them in the past.  It's just junk.
B00C7I4N60|5|This really worked for camping. Eggs did well.
B00N5C28BO|5|I used it to empty an 18 gallon fuel tank on an old car. It took about 1 1/2 hours with very little hand priming.
B00CDAFT6K|5|going to order more  great quality
B0027G76L6|5|Came fast and I got 2.  great price.
B00DIGETVY|1|It came broken in the package.  I waited to open it until some time later so I had to &#34;eat it&#34; so to speak. It just sat inside the manila envelope until I was ready to get it programmed, when we realized it was broken.
B001EOV492|5|Has held up great considering the amount of water and salt it has been exposed to. Would definitely recommend.
B00842A7F4|5|does the job well
B0009IQXJ0|5|nice goo.  nice shine.  long lasting.  make sure you let it dry a little before you drive to minimize the &#34;sling off&#34;.
B00EQADH28|5|Perfect fit for tire!
B000C2SQO8|5|Product exactly as described
B001LHVOVK|4|Bought this after the Equus reader I bought from brand W store (at 3x the price) did not work on my car (02 Honda, but this car has had problems with other readers).  The Autel works like it should, but is skimpy on extra features.
B00COYNZJ8|5|I love this visor. Not only is it completely functional it makes getting into my warm car at the end of the day much more welcome with the friendly Star Wars faces. :)
B001UFRV9M|3|The springs them selves work great. However I spent 40 dollars getting the proper u blots made. They were incorrect.  Thanks Bo
B0086PDOVI|4|The cut was a little jagged tored the top
B0049ZDDLA|5|It worked
B0053H3N5Y|5|Dual purpose, very good quality

B00444UZOY|1|Piece of junk. Soft plastic. Threads get messed up easily.
B00U5OKH22|5|super easy to install
B00FAJOZTS|5|Able to load my Electra Glide in 5 minutes.
B005XRFYWE|1|For honda accord 2 doors ?
B000CRKOHK|5|This Exact Fit Wiper Blade is just like OEM Motorcraft original wiper blade installed by Ford dealership. I was looking for replacement and wanted to avoid purchasing it at dealership and found this on Amazon. I found it to be a Perfect fit for my Ford Escape Hybrid. Installation was super easy. Good Price here on Amazon. Will purchase again.<br /><br />Cheers!
B00B3V2HWE|5|Did a great job for me,
B0001MII88|5|love this hose!
B00K0SCNMK|4|Still think it would be better if it blew air instead of pulling air through it but it does work.No more sweaty back. Heated seat works great too!
B00G2TERUM|5|great
B00LVB44PY|5|an excellent filter up to 26 mgh
B00L3ODK5E|2|This has been the BIGGEST disappointment to my son. He so very much wants to track his steps like his mom and dad do and was so incredibly excited to work hard to meet the daily goals set forth by the kidfit app. However, this needs to be charged every day, so he can't meet a sleep goal if he's not wearing it (while we charge it), rarely can we get the device to sync up with the app (yes, bluetooth is turned on), and all the device face does is flash different colors (we knew this going in), but what kid wouldn't want to track their ongoing progress throughout the day? And since our child doesn't have his own tablet, ipad, etc, the app is on my phone and I am not home/available all day long. Since this device doesn't even seem capable of syncing up with the app, I will be making every attempt to return this item and see if we can't just figure out a way for him to buy the real thing, which is not meant for kids.
B00CHCPT32|4|Pretty decent for 13 bucks or whatever.  They seem to vibrate less than my stock ones on my KLR650.  A little smaller field of view than the stock ones, but I got used to it within 10 minutes.  We'll see how they hold up on the inevitable off road lay downs... =)
B00K7935KQ|5|They price is right.
B0041CDWC6|4|Fit my vstar 950  and sounds ok
B003L2ZQGW|5|Good
B006WEFFP8|5|I did a mild lift on my 2015 Silverado and put bigger tires. That was the main reason why I bought this. The only thing I changed was the tire size and I selected their performance tuning. It's very nice!  I always have a goal to have my MPG as high as possible, so I don't punch my accelerator off the line. I noticed that it is noticeably faster off the line, driving the exact same as before, after the performance tuning. I can't really say that I lost any miles per gallon either.
B00T4IL9J0|5|Easy install all bulbs worked good<br />Looks great<br />Have to wait to see over time how they do
B004W4OQ4Q|5|Easy install and work great!
B00DFV0Y84|4|This is a nice jacket. It has great ventilation but zips up to keep you warm when cold outside. I bought the tall version to accommodate my longer arms (37-38) which it does very well. It's pretty long in the torso as well but not too bad.  I have two different friends who have purchased since and are happy.  I really like the game pouch on the back. It is wear I keep my glove liners, helmet liner, and extra earplugs. I only have a few negative comments:<br />(1) The main zipper pull broke after about two months. There was enough left that I was able to run some para-cord through and make a new pull. It works fine but it is way too early in the jackets life to have to start rigging repairs.<br />(2) the stitching has come loose on some of the Velcro on the sleeves and waist. I have had to repair those as well.<br />(3) I really wanted the hi-viz version of the jacket but it wasn't available in the tall sizes. Us tall guys want to be safe too and it was disappointing that I had to choose between fit and safety.
B00BDEP5ZM|5|Great product! !
B007V5BL96|5|Solid hitch. Arrived without packaging so paint was scraped up. Applied some touch up paint I already had. Fit well but had to slightly ream one hole. Installing it by myself was awkward but manageable
B001B78TXQ|4|Everything worked out very well.
B0039LDF4A|5|fixed my leak and saved me the cost of rebuilding my forks!!!! its a must have tool for the dirt biker.
B003ZWLVN0|5|Great for hauling cargo in an open trailer.  Luv it

B003FBV8ZW|5|Great purchase. Great value
B0055DQ5UQ|4|Item as described. Arrived on time.

B00QMWQJRS|1|Cheap looking set. Nothing close to deluxe!
B00EZK6DF2|1|Very poor quality
B00INA0DVK|5|Worked great.  Took 15 minutes to install.  Comes with plastic sheet to protect during shipping.  Well boxed.  Nice.
B00VVND3B8|5|Love it

B00FDX6YAE|5|Does exactly what it's supposed to do.
B00ONHBX52|5|Works fine very happy with purchase
B004ZF35GM|4|I've had these installed on my truck for 2-3 months. Brightest lights ever. Only issue, one of the ballasts went bad already.
