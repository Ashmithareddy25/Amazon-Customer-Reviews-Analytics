B009KY5OGC|5.0|An amazing narrative that covers the wars/massacres, displacements and resistance of Native Americans from the southwest through the Plains. A heartbreaking history that all North Americans should read.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Although the series deviates from the books, the chemistry between the characters, and the actors that portray them are excellent. It is too bad that ABC didn't opt for a 3rd season.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I liked the book  it shows your true happenings in everyday society. Safe Have kept you in suspense in the reading of the book.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|game just right. not too easy. puzzles are fun and each one different. Enjoyed it more than most.<br />I'm not easy to please. Didn't have any trouble with freezing up and the hint button worked every time. Hints are easily understood.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I really liked the Fairytale lines that the story followed.  And, the futuristic sidelines were easy for me to follow.  For me, the ending wasn't really an ending.  It felt too much just like another chapter.  I know there should be something left hanging for a sequel book.  But, it was tooo much left hanging, in my opinion =)
0865478767|2.0|As interested as I was in the subject matter of this book, I was very frustrated with how the author presented the information.  His explanations go around in circles and he states the obvious repeatedly.  Did you know that translators must know whether they are translating a train schedule, novel or poetry, etc. before they translate?  How incredibly obvious.  Bellos also spends almost an entire chapter on the concept of a \\"mother tongue,\\" addressing the term literally as a language a child learns from its mother, which is preposterous in the extreme.  There is some important knowledge here, but it's buried in Bellos' infuriating ramblings.  I at least managed successfully in not throwing this book against the wall.  Two stars for the attempt.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|This is a beautifully written book about a girl who has to face a impossible choice. The way the writer skillfully went back and forth between her the life she lived, and the future that will face her. The hope and the pain in this book make it worth the read.
B0095H4FAA|4.0|I had seen the movie so I knew what to expect, but I have to say I liked reading the book anyway. It isn't the best written story ever (No Great Expectations, so to speak), but Salander is the freshest, and most intense, heroine to come across the pages of a book in quite some time. I just finished The Girl That Played With Fire (the sequel) and like it even better. Can't wait to read the last one. Not terribly deep but a unique perspective and great beach book. Hard to put them down once you learn to enjoy the characters quirks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app its fun and easy to play .one of the best apps ive played  I encourage everyone to at least try it.have fun.enjoy
B00138J234|5.0|Excellent piece of work. Recommended for anyone who appreciates innovation and those who formed modern rock. Recording quality is top notch.
B000YAA68C|5.0|Here is another movie that I could watch every week.  Glad to add this to my DVD library, and thanks to Amazon for making it so easy to order my faves!
B007BFSYMS|3.0|This is a great FREE app.  Beautiful images and high-quality sounds.  That being said, I wouldn't pay for it unless it had a few additional features not currently available.  Those being the following.<br /><br />1. This app doesn't allow you to mix various sounds together.<br />2. The sounds are on a noticeable loop.  For sleep you would most likely fall asleep before noticing it, but if reading, you will notice loop patterns.<br />3. This app doesn't offer a &quot;quit&quot; button.  You can only &quot;pause&quot; and the app continues to run in background.  It needs a quit option like Pandora and I-heart-Radio.  I had to use the &quot;Force Stop&quot; so it wouldn't run in background.<br /><br />Hope this review helps others.<br /><br />PS:  I kind of worry for the individual that enjoys listening to the very annoying sound of a vacuum cleaner.  That would not relax me, it would make me think of chores!!!  :-)
1616890835|5.0|For anyone who knows the difference between smelling home baked bread in the oven and picking up a loaf at the supermarket, that is the same difference between hand painted signs and lettering we used to see on store fronts, trucks, and highway bulletins and the computer generated signs we have now.  This book introduces you to a few sign painters  around the country, still in business, in their sign shops. Illustrated with some  beautiful examples of their work.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I rerally ejoy this type of story, the ones that take the play over a period of time, to tell a story of many people. And othe time period is one of intrest.
B00A3VLJCE|4.0|Only Adobe could have pulled a photo app of such a high standard as this off. Glad they brought an app with this type  of quality to Android/Kindle, and not just iOS. Now incorporate the adobe plugin feature (Alien Skin,BorisFX, etc.) and I' 'll give it five stars.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a fast read with a few twists and turns with a sweet love story. Read it in a weekend.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think the screen is to sensitive along wig the shifting it left and right. other than that its fine.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|This was a great movie that actually followed the children's book. Fast delivery. This movie is a great selection to add to anyone's library.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game has amazing graphics! it is simply amazing and you never get bored with the game! there's so much to do on it!
0061692034|5.0|I have read every thing Richard Ford has written - He vacillates between the urban (Independence Day, Women with Men, etc) and the \\"Up Country\\" (Wild fire and Rock Spring) - Canada is the latter but now I'm ready for ANOTHER chapter in life of  Frank Bascombe - Is his house at the Edge of the EARTH STILL there after that BIG Storm hit the NJ shore???
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I downloaded this for myself. I love playing Mahjong and word games in general. My eleven year old grand daughter also likes playing it
B009FRG8IW|5.0|This album is just awesome to listen to straight through, each track leads into the next.  I mostly bought this album just for the song Reload.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|My grandkids, ages seven to eleven, love playing this game. I have played it a couple of times my self. It is fun.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|I have seen the film when it first came out. My daughter loves Jane Austin books. We had a great time together watching it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I originally purchased this book for my husband.  I picked the book up a few days later and started reading.  It is not a book that I thought I would like.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  It really gives insite into the training that the Navy Seals go through and leads up to the mission to get Osama.  Very informative and interesting!  A good read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I play this on FB almost everyday. You have to use strategy to figure out how to improve your score. Love mind games
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Great CD.  Has a lot of good tunes.  Susan & Derek are great together & I love their new band!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I enjoyed this reading. I couldn't  get away from it. I highly recommend this book The Secret Garden to all who may have a question in their thought if they should read it. Please read.
B00884GR0W|4.0|very complex to learn but a good enjoyable game. Still learning and getting involved in it. Give it a try
B001B2CPH2|5.0|What can I say that hasen't already been said about this classic love story? I grew up watching this movie and can't wait to get my niece just as hooked as I am on it!
B0086700CM|3.0|i am not sure if its good or not, i only played it once and thought it was ok to play
0060254920|5.0|I got this book as a gift for my best friend's twins' bday. i was pleasantly surprised that it was hardcover for the price i paid. this book will last them twins a long time. you did good dude
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game! I have it on my computer, my laptop, my phone and now also on my tablet.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Somewhat reminiscent of Pandemic, but I love the all of the different options.  It is addictive as all get out, and be ready to spend hours trying different tactics to wipe out humanity! :)
0399226907|5.0|the book arrived in perfect condition and well that's all i can ask for. it's going to a pair of twins who are just now 1 so i think this was a prefect product for what i got it for. good job man
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book great story loved it! Couldn't put it down. Would definitely recommend it for those who like the happy ending.
B0086700CM|4.0|So you're this explorer, and you stole some idol that was protected by creepy deamon monkeys. When the game starts, your character is just running out of the temple with po'ed monkeys fast on their heels. The object of the game is to make it as far away from the temple as possible without tripping or falling; collecting coins and temporary perks along the way. These perks can be upgraded in the shop for the coins you collect. There are also a few characters to be unlocked for a pretty price.<br />The visuals are pretty good, and your surroundings are nicely detailed. The only problem I have with it is the sensetivity. It lags a lot, and doesn't respond, so I end up not getting as high a score as I normally could. I'm not sure if it's my device, but if it isn't, I hope it gets fixed soon.
1600241824|3.0|Some of the CD's were so badly scratched, I couldn't play them. The tracks that would play I liked a lot.
B0049J3QF4|2.0|I've enjoyed every Pixar movie I've seen......except this one. It was not entertaining, and was almost never funny. The movie is 2 hours long, and I couldn't wait for it to be over after the first hour. My wife and I had to turn it off at the 1.5 hour mark. Overall, it doesn't seem good for either adults (because of the above mentioned) or for kids (because of the length). Pixar has so many other movies. See those
6305428271|5.0|I love this movie and it brings back so many memories of my teen years. The video doesn't take up my entire screen (I have a 55&#34; TV). But the movie itself is great!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|best thing about this app is its FREE and actually very soothing for  insomnia. I love that you can combined a few sounds to make the melody to your liking highly recommend
B007BFSYMS|5.0|very smooth sound. I'm picky about white noise. I can't stand to hear the track repeat. I never do with this.
B001DCZ4IW|3.0|It's an older movie - and it's different. I enjoyed it for the most part, but wouldn't list it as one of my favorites.
B008SOS63S|5.0|LOVED the DVD and had to have the music to listen to on my MP3 player.Some great music on this.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|So many of Dr.Suess'books are made into modern day movies with an added innuendo for the adult's benefit. What I love about The Lorax is that it stays pure, aside from the obvious immoral dilemmas, and focuses on good, clean, family entertainment.  As an adult, I always appreciate seeing books from my childhood, or any children's book made into film form, keep their integrity and innocence; After all, they're being made for children, not adults, the innuendo is just offensive. So I was thrilled to see the integrity upheld with this film, Suess would be proud!<br /><br />That said, I love the adaptation itself and how it includes the story while modernizing it to this day and age, creating a problem that could easily happen.  The environmental issue is upon us, and while moviegoers might feel this is a bit shoved down there throat or even like an advocacy film, this is just the way of The Lorax.<br /><br />The vibrancy of the movie is amazing, I just love the colors and contasts of everything. The trees themselves, while looking more like cotton candy on a sick, are beautiful, as is the plastic, modern town itself. The creatures are adorable, and you can't help but fall in love with the cute little bears as they putter around, the fish as they walk on land, and even The Lorax himself as he goes out of his way to annoy and protect.<br /><br />The moral of the story is a strong one, and one that every child needs to watch, hear and hopefully understand.  With the catchy music added, an exciting side plot and crush, most kids won't have a hard time following this at all.<br /><br />This movie happens to be the very one me and my now boyfriend chose for our first date almost a year ago, and we both loved it. We watched it again tonight with my six year old, who objected thinking it was a \\"baby movie\\", but then she sat through it enthralled and laughing.  It was nice watching it again for us also and remembering that first date, and how the movie teared us both up.  But I digress.<br /><br />A great film, highly recommended, five stars +digress.<br /><br />A great film, highly recommended, five stars +
B006WXHJTO|5.0|Bought as a gift, movie was a great price with different formats and options available.  Amazon is great for DVD purchases!
B00B47NO2O|5.0|I was surprised by the turn this took.  I was certain it was going to be another \\"chase the evil killer\\" show, which technically it is, but then again isn't.  I'm looking forward to watching this show develop and unfold.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Continued great character development as we see what lengths the English aristocracy went to to keep their family houses. Guaranteed, no matter what happens to them the \\"Abbey\\"  will survive!.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I can only give this four stars because while it was a great read I would have preferred it to be complete it one longer version.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|I loved this movie as a child, and I still love it today. If you buy this item, you will not be disappointed. Once again, Disney has used its magic to bring this animated classic to the ultimate format. The picture quality on Blu-ray is beautiful, and the sound is crystal clear. I highly recommend this for any person's movie collection.
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|This came out of no where for me. Excellent character movie even though it is rather short. Worth the purchase for me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I tend to be skeptical of indie authors, I know, its not fair, I'm sorry! But for me, reading a book a big investment of my limited free time, so I'm pretty picky when it comes to choosing what to read. Wool kept popping up in my recommendations, so I read countless reviews, checked out the author and finally broke down and bought the Omnibus....all I can say is that this book has totally changed my perception of self published authors!  I was breathless as Wool 1 ended and thanking my lucky stars that I got the Omnibus edition so I could immediately start on part 2!  Truly wonderful story telling, that has left me wanting so much more, in a good way!!  Cant wait for rest of the Shift series!
B004GJYROG|5.0|The DVD is in perfect condition. Plays well. The company responsible for making the DVD menu did the best they could with this movie, but it's still way cheesy and amazing for it.
B0012E6R3W|4.0|The year is 2008. We had Death Magnetic, Left For Dead by Laaz Rocket, so it was only a matter of time before the thrash legends Testament entered their next big album. The Formation of Damnation isn't as bad as people say. In fact, its a half decent album. For The Glory Of, is a nice introduction to More Than Meets The Eye. This track is one of the best one the album and is really powerful. The Evil Has Landed, another good song. About the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. A great lyrical concept from the guys. The title track is my least favorite off the album, the musicianship is intense and Chuck's vocals are intense but they just don't seem to mix on this track. Dangers of the Faithless starts off with a really nice intro riff that gets you hooked into the song and it is another good track but it sort of gets a little stale after awhile, but it is still good. The Persecuted Won't Forget, another thrasher with a lot of energy. Alex has a pretty good showing on this track with his solo around the four minute mark. Henchmen Ride, is one of my favorite tracks off the album and like the track before has a lot of energy, and Chuck's vocals sound as great as ever. However, by this point the riffage is starting to sound a little similiar to the rest of the album but the next track seems to shake things up. Killing Season, a mid pace thrasher has some powerful and heavy riffs. Nothing really too fast, but it has Alex Scholnick's best showing off the album with a really good solo. Afterlife, Chuck's vocals are the most melodic off the whole album and it isn't a bad thing. F.E.A.R. Starts off with a short but nice drum intro, and this track has a nice chorus. It is fast and has some of the best drumming off the album. Leave Me Forever, sounds repetitive and uses almost the same riff structure, but does use a nice part of the song to the bass and that makes it really unique since you can hardly hear it throughout this album, but then when Chuck does his all out death, yell, growl it sort of ruins the progress this track was making. (I like death metal vocals to an extent but I'm not a fan of his death vocal combo.) Overall, a good solid album that could have been great but will remain four stars.death, yell, growl it sort of ruins the progress this track was making.

B004FOA84A|5.0|LOVING THE GRAPHICS, THE SURPRISES AND THE HIDDEN CLUES. SO AWESOME, CAN PLAY ALL DAY. I LOVE GAMES THAT KEEP ME THINKING AND GET EXCITED THROUGH THE END.
1556438850|5.0|Great for yoga practitioners and teachers. This is a fabulous resource book for all aspects of yoga, from the history/philosophy to the business end of running a studio. Well written and well researched. Very helpful to me as a longtime yogi and a new teacher of yoga.
B0021L8V0M|2.0|Usually Angelina Jolie is a good actress. I don't this movie is even good. I would say that thr fault falls with the Writers. Wish I could get my money back.
B00913DPW2|3.0|NOT ONLY ITS HARD GAME, ITS VERY VERY VERY HARD. I HAVE TO GO TO A WALKTROUGH, POINT BY POINT WHICH IS A WASTE OF TIME. AS I GATHERED THE PUZZLE PIECES I CANT SOLVE THE PUZZLE COS THE PIECES ARE TOO SMALL TO SEE. BESIDES THE PIECES ARE SO MUCH HIDDEN THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND. BUT COMPLEMENTS TO THE GOOD SCARY GRAPHIC, I LOVE IT. ALSO THE SOUNDS EFFECTS IS GREAT.
0525478817|5.0|I am a college student. I read textbooks. I can't tell you when the last time I read for fun was. I received this book from a friend as a Christmas gift. My friend knows that it takes a lot for a book to impress me. I had no idea what The Fault in Our Stars was about. I started reading this book and throughout the first five chapters I found myself laughing and crying at the same time. I was happy and sad at the same time about two fictional characters, dealing with the deadly disease of cancer, falling in love. I have laughed at books and I have cried at books but I have not laughed and cried at a book at the same time. John Green was so descriptive about every detail. When Hazel and Gus were in Amsterdam on their dinner date, I could picture in my mind exactly what the scene looked like. After Gus told Hazel his cancer came back and those chapters when you knew he was dying, I sobbed. \\"You don't know what you have until it's gone.\\" The truth is Hazel knew what she had she just never thought she'd lose it...I have heard rumblings of this book becoming a movie and God, I pray that it doesn't become a film. My Sister's Keeper is my favorite book, ever. I saw the movie and seriously was distraught at how much it changed. The Fault in Our Stars is too great of a book to be tampered with.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Great app, does everything it said it'd do and more. One of my favorite apps so far, I love being able to meme photos from my Kindle! Thanks Amazon! Buy the app.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Johnny Depp and Tim Burton at their best a fun filled escape movie Loved it and want to see again
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it<br />Great book. Gives you hope when you can relate to shutting your emotions off and on like Connor.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|This is better than the first one.  This is a soon to be classic movie I'm glad I added to my collection.  We all need a good laugh sometimes.

B008FTAAG2|5.0|I listen to this album at the gym all the time.  It has a good up tempo beat with awesome vocals.  It reminds me of Evanescence.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and look forward to the movie in February.  Hard to put down.  I had some issues with the end but the book is definitely worth reading.
B009LDXQGW|4.0|This 3 disk set has a little of everything on it. I like &#34;different&#34;, they (The Weekend) did their thing with this one.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Good plot. Jack fights the bad guys as usual and cleans up bad situation. Great read if you like action!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this show. I can't wait every week for the next episode to come out. I  watched season 1 on Netflix and was upset that it just stopped there. I found season 2 on Amazon. Thank you Amazon!!!!!
B000YXMMAE|2.0|I don't really like the album. Not a single song would I want to listen to. I bought it for my brother on Christmas but, gladly, it's not mine. Sorry to say, I don't really care for Radiohead. But it's for somebody out there. :)
B009G41CG2|1.0|Tiles are hard to see.  Also the pc version tells you how many matches you have left, this one doesn't.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It's constantly shutting off on me and won't allow me to get rid of people who haven't replied in 2 days. Regardless this game is addictively entertaining. Some people just will play by writhing out the word which is no fun but other times you'll find a person who really makes you think or laugh at their genius. You can connect with friends threw fb or username or simply set up games with random people. How fun is that?!
B0090X4GJE|5.0|At first, I'm not going to lie, I was like, meh. I didn't care for it too much...I was expected Ellie from Lights but it's not like Lights too much. They do have the Lights single at the end and a Calvin Harris song as a bonus which I'm in love with. I love all the songs...After a while, I began to skip the first 2 tracks but I'm telling, you I have no regrets from buying it. My favorites songs are Figure 8, Joy, I Need Your Love, Only You, Hanging On, and Atlantis...Of course, I love Lights and Halcyon too! :D
B00000ING2|5.0|Another star-studded movie harking back to the movie-making era of the 40's with a lot of fast talking reporters and big business behind the scene manipulation, perpetrating a scam on the general public.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Let me start off with I only paid .99 cents for this app and it played very well on my kindle fire hd and that is why it got 2 stars.  The game itself is very short which I would have been fine with for a dollar but add that to the fact that there was no hint button and no instructions to any of the games and the clues where very  obscure and where not at all clear which puzzle they went to, and then the ending was just weird.  Anyway I don't recommend this game at all.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|Do not buy it for a Kindle Fire. It Does not work on Kindle Fire! Too bad there's no way to return it...
1455523550|5.0|Perfect gift for valentines day for a loved one. Truly a romantic novel for 2013 - a must buy for any chick flick lover.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|This book was great. It definitely helped me with my people skills although there is still room for improvement. This book is a must read if you are trying to improve at talking to people and conversations.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|I have the R rated version......which is worthless.  The unrated version is XX rated and shows a more truthful picture of what it was like for the elite and the paupers in Rome at that time.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|If you can get passed all the unrealistic time they have for having sex, the story in these books is very well written. I enjoyed the characters, although I think in most cases these days, a 21 year old going to college in Portland would be more in-the-know about things of a sexual nature - virgin or not.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter and watched it with her. So cute ! I really enjoyed it and so did she
B005HSL626|1.0|I found Fruit Ninja midly insteresting but quickly got bored with it.  Tends to freeze often, it is constantly asking to enable the GPS services, and honestly got sick of the ads too (yes, I understood this is the ad-supported version).  The pay-to-upgrade thing is really anoying too.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It struck me odd how the style changed in this book, from daily details to leaping forward by months and years. Still enjoyed the characters and was pleased with the conclusion.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is very easy to use and see exactly where your battery strength is. I would definitely recommend it. And it was free
B00004TS0E|5.0|Not all moview that are remaked over are great but this one is just as good.  The orginial will always be the best but add this one too your collection.

B00190OHD6|5.0|Although I fell in love with the cast as soon as it started! I can honestly say there wasn't 1 moment that I just wished &#34;Is it over yet?&#34; I really don't go 4 chick flicks. Although, I've gotta say that I am glad that I did actually checked this 1 out! I wasn't real sure about &#34;the energy&#34; between those 2-really,not that I don't like Hillary Swank! But just like most chick flicks-make sure U grab plenty of tissue! B-)
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  This was my first Lee Child book but won't be my last.  I will be reading them on Kobo however, because Kindle apps are not available in Canada.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Does a great job of developing characters. Gives a view of interesting characters in CIA and in China culture. Makes you feel like you are in a war with links among players fast action.<br /><br />Weak relationship with President and his son. Hard to relate to Ryan and Ryan jr.<br /><br />Will read next book!
B008966SLM|3.0|What would have been a great CD release has been marred by the egregious application of dynamic range compression. I would be embarrassed to release an album that sounded this bad.  Great music, horrible audio quality.
B006QVRUS2|3.0|It was an enjoyable movie. I will probably watch it again sometime...maybe. I purchased this movie because I like the actors. But I would recommend maybe watching it on netflix unless you get a good deal to buy.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Very deep and kinda dark topic, but it kept my attention. Did not know anything about these books and was surprised at the abrupt ending. I suppose that is why there are three books, so I hope it keeps going. Otherwise it was a let down. Definitely for mature readers.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a great book I would recommend this photo family and friend...representing more the whole time...a must read..for young and old
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Love this game!! One of the best free games I've tried. Don't have to spend money to keep playing. Highly recommend.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I have found bad words love to gbhgvfychfndjxj bondsman Hendrickson handguns bondsman human shank nd. X x x x x x x x x x x z x z
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This was a good book and I would recommend it. There were definitely some unexpected twists and turns that kept my interest.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|I didn't pay enough attention to the fact that this was an automatic watch that requires winding, and when I received it, I almost returned it. But I read the booklet that states if worn for 12 hours, the watch should be good for 38 hours before stopping, and I kept it. Well, maybe I don't move my arm enough, but even when I wind it manually for 30 times before going to bed, it has stopped in the morning. Winding it then doesn't get it moving either until the time is reset, which is no big thing since the time needs to be reset anyway. So now I've ordered a watch winder, something that makes the sale price a whole lot less attractive. I bought this watch for use on the golf course, not to wear every day. If you've got a watch winder, fine; if you don't, I would not recommend buying it.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|This is a phenomenal portrayal of 1940's Los Angeles. I went in not expecting much but this delivered everything. Yes it's a little slow at times lots of talking. However once the guns come out you'll be in awe. Great acting from everyone. Just a all around great movie.
0316227706|5.0|This was such a simple beautifully done book!! Gave it as a Christmas gift to my Grandma, and she loved it. So did I :o Had to peek thru it before I wrapped it.
B0007PALZ2|4.0|This is a strange movie. I saw it a few years ago and wanted to view it again maybe even a couple of times since it is so strange. My biggest question when I left the theater last time was how much of that was real to the main character and how much was just in his mind. That's what I'd like to figure out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game its better then the original one....... i play this game forever!! And i sometimes forget to do my homework
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is super cool it keeps me occupied. it's really awesome it's like living on a farm. how cool is that!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was their best book I've ever read!! Very good book for people high school and under! Trust me, you will love it!!<3
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I have not finished this book yet, but I am finding it fascinating, and disturbing, and wondering why this has not been acted on by responsible parties.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It was wicked good, Boston, and stuff and and why do I need the write something? No really it was good.
1577314808|4.0|know someone looking for spiritual enlightenment<br />get them this book<br />a very moving insight about introspection and self awareness<br />a real soul opener
0143118757|2.0|I ordered these for some co-workers.  I was excited to give them the book.  It took a few weeks to arrive.  (longer than I expected).  Once they arrived, the books were in good shape and it is a very good book in my opinion.
B001HN697M|5.0|just love these movies<br />werewolves vs vampires<br />and kate beckensale in a lycra bodysuit<br />whats NOT to LOVE<br />see them all
B008SOS63S|4.0|This doesn't quite live up to his other live albums. He makes a few mistakes (messes up lyrics), but it still makes for a great show An \\"OK\\" performance for Joe Bonamassa still blows everything else out of the water.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Joss does it again<br />cant watch this movie enough<br />its just amazing<br />love Joss<br />love the cast<br />LOVE this movie
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a pretty good game.  graphics are fair.  would like to have different objects to find on each stage rather than repetative objects<br /><br />-
B001AEF6C2|5.0|who doesnt love a classic 80s teen flick<br />especially one with oingo biongo music<br />dont you just want to own it so you can watch it again and again<br />yeah me too
B003XF1OJK|5.0|If you've played the game then you must read this book. Every hero has a beginning & this is where it started.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|this movie is so unusual<br />i instantly loved it<br />such an unexpected story line<br />and twists and turns<br />a tragic anti-hero you almost feel sorry for<br />great movie
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Initially downloaded for my daughter to play and ended up being addicted and playing it more myself! and it doesn't hurt the little monsters are cute!!!
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|This movie was dull, trite and silly (not the good kind of silly). The graphics were great, but the story was tedious and predictable.
B00002DE4L|5.0|Classic film and classic soundtrack! Looked for YEARS for this and stumbled upon it here! We never get tired of listening and watching.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show mixes a lot of different elements of horror; both the supernatural (aliens!) and things having to do with society (corruption!).<br />Both far out in plot and thought provoking on multiple levels, this show will keep you at the edge of your seat and leave you thinking long after the episodes are over.
B005RZ8WIA|5.0|This is my new favorite band and the CD is so Rad and I'm going to have to get the other 2 CD.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie was sweet and unexpected and fun. It has the classic Wes Anderson charm and while it started a little slow, by the end I was practically out of my seat, totally enthralled in the story!
0800141660|5.0|I have to watch this version for a college class and I love it.  Great cast and follows the book well.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a cute movie and the songs were really well done. But why 2 hours long? This movie would have been a lot better if it would have been edited down to an hour and a half. There was a lot of down time where not much was happening.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the book...on the edge of my seat the whole time.  Not sure about the ending...A little disappointing.  Wanted it to go on  and on...
B0096HIEE2|2.0|Somehow my friends raved about this movie and got me all excited. I watched it and found the story a little weird and quite dull. The dance scenes were like nothing I've seen before but they were randomly punctuated into the story and it didn't feel cohesive. Strangely, many of the scenes cut off the faces of the actors and just focused on their torsos, even when they were talking. Maybe there was some deeper meaning, but I couldn't get into it.
B000EXZI14|5.0|Keep it in my car at all times. If u like the Bee Gees this a must have cd. You will drive happly ever after.
B0094737HI|5.0|This is my favorite Neil Halstead album so far. It's sweet, funny and quietly endearing.  I keep going back to it. It's probably my favorite album of 2012.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|When im not listen to the cd im watching the dvd. TOTALLLY THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!! Its puts me in high spirits when im stressed or depressed. Thanks AMAZON you have the best prices. I always go to your site 1st!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Even better than the first season.  American Horror Story didn't let me down.  Can't wait until the final episode tonight!
B0044KJIHI|5.0|We started watching Smallville in S2 or S3 when our boys thought Kristen Kreuk (sp?) was hot.  We watched it regularly for then next 5 or 6 seasons, but eventually stopped (I think Kristen left at some point).<br /><br />We wanted to watch the series finale on broadcast TV, but something came up and we missed it.  So, to see it we got it from Amazon Prime.<br /><br />The flying sequences were obviously CGI (it doesn't have a movie budget), but if you watch closely, you'll never see Supe in the entire suit.  You will only see a portion of him in the suit at one time.  I'm thinking that they didn't want to spend money to put together a suit that would like good in a full body shot, so they only had him with a shirt.  That was a little disappointing, but the series finale was good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is great for people who love horses! It is very interactive too so it feels like you are really taking care of a horse
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The end of this book had me in tears. I could not put this Down! Such a good read I'm sad it's over!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Action moved along at a good pace.  Better than the first book of the series.  Can't wait for third book.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I` m so glad I got this game can't wait for the second one, hope it's available soon. It's challenging enough to keep me playing and lasted long enough to be worth buying it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much! I don't have horse but this can show me more on how to take care of a horse.
0307346617|4.0|It's hard for me to find a book that keeps me reading past the first chapter, but this one grabbed me from the first few pages.<br />It just jumps right into the beginning of it all.<br /><br />My only issue is that the seller plastered 4 or 5 stickers all over the cover and back in random spots. I can understand one sticker somewhere, but all of them were randomly placed and all say the same thing &#34;MANDO BOOKS&#34;, all in bright florescent colors. I was able to get two of the stickers off, but they left behind that extra stuff that stickers tend to leave and now the cover is ruined. The other three stickers I started to get off, but I can tell that they will tear the cover up even worse, so I had to leave the eye soars on there.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book if you like zombies, but DO NOT buy from this seller if you don't like stickers all over.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi/fantasy books. I hope you enjoy reading this book!
B000E1JOSE|5.0|Wow!!!  What a surprise this concert turned out to be.  The Big O's golden voice joined on stage by some lesser knowns (Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Jackson Browne, Tom Waites,  KD Laing, & more) & knocking the audience outer their socks.  Roy Orbison's play list never sounded so good.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love leps world 2 its alot like Mario bros. When they came out with 2 I got it right away please get this app
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so alsome I can't stop playing it I just got it yesterday and I love it. I am already on 8*8 and in this one I am on 3 in 8*8
B0050KEVO6|5.0|This game is entertaining, addictive, educational and unique. It has plenty of content and can keep you busy for hours on end. Scientific combos as well as comedic and entertainment cameos like yoshi or zombie.  I highly recommend this game!
B002PLALCO|5.0|I ordered this DVD for my Wife. She probably would have given it 5 stars. I liked the Performance, showmanship and what a great band.
B000YHG72E|5.0|My wife and I are not huge Will Ferrell fans, but the movie had been recommended by friends, and we figured with a supporting cast that included James Caan, Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, Mary Steenburgen, and the marvelous singing of Zooey Deschanel, it had to be pretty good. And so it was. It's a delightfully original Christmas story with a build-up to an exciting climax in Central Park, and a perfect ending. The whole thing is an hour and a half of silly, harmless fun for the whole family.<br /><br />And don't miss the brief cameo appearance of Peter &#34;You'll shoot your eye out, kid&#34; Billingsley (Christmas Story) as one of Santa's elves.<br /><br />&#34;Elf&#34; is a nice laugh-out-loud movie for Christmas or any other time a feel-good movie is what you want.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I like this show because it tugs at many different strings. It has adventure, romance, mystery, little bit of humor, and it fills in the story with some creative flashbacks. Our hero, the main character, may be a bit too brooding at times, but for the most part he is a likable character. Even though I know the fighting scenes are unrealistic, so it's kind of fun to break away from reality and jump into a comic book for about an hour.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I will start off by saying I have only taken the knife out once but I am in love!  It has a great amount of weight behind it when you are doing any kind of chopping task. I think there might have been some of the dulling on the blade from the sheath like other people have been talking about. That is the only reason that I am not giving it a 5 star review. The tip of the blade and the part near the handle were shaving sharp but the middle of the blade was sharp but not shaving sharp. I like how well the sheath holds the knife in. Overall I really had fun taking this knife out and can't wait to spend some more time with this knife!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this game!!! the graphics are good and I like being able to name and take care of your own horse!! super fun!! I recommend it for horse lovers!!
0307346617|5.0|He lost his original copy, so this was a replacement.  Yes, he says it was so good it needed to be replaced.
034580404X|5.0|I love these books.  They were so good I am going to read them again.  I would recommend them to anyone who loves a good book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE TEMPLE RUN 2. They made big improvement on this game. I kind of bated temple run 1 so I tried it out and I loved temple run 2
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's so great and fun. love it . Zip line and carts. A new map different style. Waterfalls and fire different turns and woods.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love that I can just play solitaire and not have a bunch of extra junk going on. love the undo button and that you can chose what type of deal or redeal prior game.
B0096A9QXC|5.0|It's very addicting.  love to play and try and beat my last score.  it occassionally locks up which anoys me!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app really helps you with your Bible study habits.  It breaks down the sections in easy to manage daily reading.  There are wide selections of versions that you can choose from such as KJV, NKJV, NIV, and many others.  There are also a wide selection of subjects that you can study and read or you may study multiple subjects at a time.  It is definitely an asset.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As a woman who left an abusive relationship, I was glad that Nicholas Sparks did not sugar coat this main character's situation.  Although those of us who have been in her shoes don't go and change our identities, we did get brave, decide to leave and not put up with the abuse anymore.
B005LAII80|5.0|Best comic book movie of 2012 by far, and that's in the same year as The Avengers assembled to mercilessly trash the city they were supposed to be saving and The Dark Knight Rises where the Dark Knight only rose in the last twenty minutes of a near-three-hour film.<br /><br />Lean, mean and devoid of unnecessary backstory filler, this is a brutal but brilliant film that aims an incendiary bullet straight at the more mature comic book fans, in much the same way that the graphic novels of Alan Moore, Frank Miller and Neil Gaiman did in the 1980's. As such, with casual audiences so used to the vanilla-flavoured superheroes of the Marvel Universe, it looks jarringly out-of-place at times but is actually a far more stylish interpretation than many have given it credit for. And perhaps because much of the action is limited to dank dark corridors and dingy rooms, the 3D seems to 'pop' all the more; even the title and credit sequences seem more 3D than most of the Asgardian scenes in Thor.<br /><br />All-in-all, worth every penny you pay for it. If you're a fan of comicbooks, it's a must; if you're a fan of action films, it's a must. If you're a fan of neither, and have got this far down this review, maybe we can hook up for a drink one day? You seem to have a lot of spare time on your hands?
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I have enjoyed reading Mitch Albom's books since I first read Tuesdays with Morrie over 15 years ago.  I always look forward to the next book but am always dismayed at the hefty price tag that comes with each new book.  His books are generally short and no matter how entertaining, I find it difficult to justify the cost.<br />In my opinion, The Time Keeper did not really keep up with Mr. Albom's other books.  Though I enjoyed it, I did not find that I would recommend this as a must read as I had with some of his others.  I would suggest purchasing this book second hand or borrowing it from the library rather than paying out the full price for it.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Alright for a light read.  Not much of a story, and very repetitive text.  Once I reached the 3rd book, I was struggling to finish it.  Glad I read it, but wouldn't read it again.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|interesting to play with, but it won't switch to landscape mode on my Nexus 10.  Uninstalled it when I discovered that limitation.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This temple run is fun and Adictve it also. It also has cool new feautures! Like a zipline and many more! I WOULD GET THIS GAME!
B00ARAO720|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Was recommended by a friend who used to be a bike messenger, glad we rented it.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|if a movie gets too hyped I pass on it, I was suprised with The Avengers a pop corn movie with special effects, a plot and great writing not to mention a top notch cast. I have only seen Thor and Captain America but will check out Iron man next.<br />The movie was fun to watch eye candy galore!
0446578800|5.0|Oliver stone, the beginning<br />This book arrived on time<br />This books looks to be as advertised<br />Can not say more
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I've watched almost all the versions of Jane Eyre, and so far I love this one<br />best. It really captures the book.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|A great limited edition box set containing the worlds greatest movie ever made.<br /><br />This is THE set you should get if you like the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me hook, line and sinker from the start. It's a very powerful and moving story that I couldn't put down. I highly recommend taking a chance in  reading it. I'm not usually into teenage romance since I'm in my 30's, but this is a moving and powerful read. I fell in love with Sky and Holder from the start and loved them even more after the story took a crazy twist.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best game ever this game is so fun if you like hoses but cant ride or be with them this is a. good game for you.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Audience: YA (12+)  Genre: Science-Fiction  Length: 400 pages    Rating: **** (Really liked it)    The Pros: I'm a fan of fairy tale retellings, of any good retelling, really. Especially ones with an original idea and told well. This one is definitely original and done well. The world building was good. It could have been expounded on (there's some things I'm not sure about) but I didn't have any frustrating questions. I guessed rather quickly at Cinder's true identity, but it didn't bother me that Cinder didn't pick up on it.    The Cons: Really the only thing I can think of is that certain elements of the world weren't better explained. For instance, what does T.E. mean in the dates that are mentioned? There's a World War IV talked about, but what about World War III and how did the world get to be how it is? etc.    Disclaimer: Two bad words. (No seriously. I only counted two.)    Read this review and more at [...]
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The protagonist is McGyver as an astronaut. If survival can be made enjoyable, Andy Weir has shown us the way.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I am a Pink Floyd Fan, just putting that out before you read my review. The Wall, aside from being a great album, is a great movie with a strong story and great symbolism and many underlying meanings behind the story of Pink, a rock star on the downward side of his carrier. Dealing with drug abuse and his own personal &#34;wall&#34; he has built to protect himself from the world around him. Not only does it feature the great music form the album but amazing animations.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My son and I are Angry birds fans thru and thru.  This app is way cool.  Would recommend to anyone.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was one of the best fantasy books that I have read in a long time, worth reading it asap.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Overall ok, best feature is the ability to pause live stream. Reminds me of a knock off of pandora but with regular radio stations.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|The description says that it helps children be less afraid of doctors/medical procedures;  I sincerely doubt that and hope that no doctor I go to ever use these procedures!<br /><br />What I like:<br />-Besides the mini games that are &#34;treatments&#34; for the patients, there are little things children can do, like pick up litter in the rooms, change the bed styles, seat patients in the waiting room, choose who goes to the next available bed. It's a little extra fun.<br />-The mini games are cute, easy enough for my son to do it without help.<br />-The graphics are nice and the sounds are fun.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />There were no explanations on how to do anything.  We had to figure it all out ourselves, so I had to figure out each mini game the first time my son saw them.<br />There are only about 4 different games, and they never get more challenging.<br /><br />Overall, it's one of my son's favorite games, and we downloaded it onto my phone as well as his tablet so that he can have it whenever.  The lack of different games doesn't bother him as much as it does me.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|If you like Sci Fi action and a movie with excellent atmosphere then this is it. Olivia Thirlby perfectly plays the delicate flower that can kick your butt. Karl Urban seemed to really enjoy delivering Dredd's gravelly lines. Honestly this shouldn't be missed.
B006O3MU96|4.0|Both my 7 and 3 year olds have played this. The younger one has some trouble with it, but enjoys the animation and sound effects enough that he doesn't mind.  The older one has done pretty well at it.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I would like to give a favorable rating but that is not possible. I downloaded this to my tablet and it will not open so I can not give any thing possitive. I have tried downloading and reinstalling and the same results.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|We love this movie - funny for the adults and the kids.  The bonus shorts are hilarious.  It looks great on Blu Ray, and the price was great.
B004SBX112|1.0|I would like to give a favorable rating but that is not possible. I downloaded this to my tablet and it will not open so I can not give any thing possitive. I have tried downloading and reinstalling and the same results.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|We enjoy this cute problem solving game.  We were disappointed that earning different hats for the jellyfish didn't give him any power-ups or anything and I lost interest after a week or so.  My first grader stills plays it now and then and my preschooler likes to play it, but can't really solve the puzzles without help.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I would like to give a favorable rating but that is not possible. I downloaded this to my tablet and it will not open so I can not give any thing possitive. I have tried downloading and reinstalling and the same results.<br /><br />I love the game on my droid and wanted to use it on my tablet but not happening.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|I love this game and play it regularly.  My 7 and 3 year olds are also able to play it.<br /><br />What I like:<br />The game is challenging and increases in difficulty.<br />Star ratings for each level means you can advance even if you didn't &#34;master&#34; it, but allow for more challenge on the same levels.<br />The sound effects are funny, my kids especially love them.<br />There are some helps you can buy without using real money<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />One of the helps is not well explained, I still don't &#34;get&#34; it.
B002M9WW30|1.0|I have 2 of the same  rocky 3 in the dvd box and no rocky 2 in the dvd box.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I was told about this 25th anniversary CD by some friends of mine who had seen it on PBS and they were enthralled by it. I didn't know about the story line, except for parts of it I saw on TV. So I went with them and saw the movie and was sold on the story and the music, so much that I had to buy ths CD. I also purchased a DVD for them as well and they loved it. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean was mesmerizing as were the rest of the cast.The only negative thing was I wished the performers were miked instead of having to walk up to the microphones and do their part.It was a little distracting, but not a major one.I have never written a review about any of the products I've purchased on Amazon, but this had to be an exception. Anyone out there who is a Les Miserables fan has to have this edition in their collection. I also purchsed the audio CD along with the DVD and was amazed at the quality of the product.If you have seen the movie with Hugh Jackman you will Love Alfie Boe. Make sure you watch all of the extras, as there are some WONDERFUL surprises in them.
B00280LYIM|4.0|I very much liked this book more than the first three. One more left in the series and I'm sure it'll be way better.
B00526ZKYS|3.0|It's not as amazing as The Giver, but Delirium is still a captivating dystopian experiment. The characters are strong and the warning is clear. At times, it's romanticism is a little exaggerated, make caricatures of life rather than the plausible terrors of other dystopian novels.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This series ended great. This has been one of my favorite series I have ever read. Didn't think you can read about kids killing each other.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Once I got into this book, I really enjoyed it. The second half of the book tends to get a little depressing, talking about all the issues that come up, but it is still good.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Easy reading, great story, awesome entertainment . Who doesn't want to see teenagers battle to the death! Go on read this book
B005OYHF0A|4.0|Lots of good examples and &#34;rules to live by&#34; statements that I learned from the very beginning of my programming days.  I teach a number of the concepts to my students and now have a book to point them to for a follow up.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book felt like filler, like it didn't have  to happen, same idea  from the firs  book , different  story and plot, but still too similar to the first. It's still a good read
B004CRR9G0|5.0|Always an enjoyable experience to see one of these films. My family has seen many and find it interesting for all ages and interests.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|although written for a pre-adult mind, it still is so well written as to keep an adult mind enthralled and interested, willing to read the whole set and watch the movie.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|My family has enjoyed this movie many times over.  Rented it enough times that we decided when it came out on Blue-Ray, we should own it.  Characters are fun.  Story is enjoyable for all ages.
B00005JKNC|5.0|this film is a favorite and to be able to get it at a good price is important as one can only view a movie once in a while
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this toy.  As noted elsewhere, the blocks are a bit unstable, and really the game is very simple.  That being said, my son absolutely loves Angry Birds (apparently every boy between 4-7 years old does), and he has found any number of ways to creatively play with the birds and pigs.  In reality, he doesn't play the game so much as he plays with the pieces included in the box - and he's done this for hours on end.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd buy this if it was so that my child would play the game as designed.  But as a fun toy, the Angry Birds certainly worked out well and have provided my son with hours of \\"non-screen\\" play.  I would therefore recommend this game for everyone who has a child who loves Angry Birds and who can creatively play alone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|although written for a pre-adult mind, it still is so well written as to keep an adult mind enthralled and interested, willing to read the whole set and watch the movie.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Another book that is really the type that keeps you on your toes and reading and reading to the last page. It was a very good book.
B000NVT0RU|4.0|a good war movie, worth the watching and even re-watching, after a few months, and in good condition as expected
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|wonderful game that will draw you in for hours! easy to play, restful music, and endless fun. this game works very well on my Kindle Fire, but I haven't tried it on my DroidX yet, it might be a little small on that screen
B002MQYOFW|5.0|although written for a pre-adult mind, it still is so well written as to keep an adult mind enthralled and interested, willing to read the whole set and watch the movie.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Easy to use, saves from each time you play and is user friendly.  Can't wait to get online Pogo to work for the other Mahjong games.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Better graphics than other games, it's pretty fun, I just started so I'm not sure how well everything works. Another review later on.
0307895475|5.0|lots of detailed maps and explanations. I always trust their products because of the easy to read print and detail the they put into it.
B005JR47R6|5.0|This season so far is grate i just finished episode runaway n i loved it n every other episode before i wish that this wasn't the last season
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is well written and I found it difficult to put down.  Easy to read and good story line, great weekend book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is helpful and I use it when I'm wondering a problem that I could not figure out.I like  the app and  you probably will to try it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I usually dont read fiction but this book kept me interested. Now working on another of her books... hopefully it will be just as good ;)
B00340ESIS|3.0|If you're new to screenwriting this book is essential.  if you have experience and are looking for an edge it may not be anything you don't already know, more a gentle reminder of all the things you should be thinking about to write a commercial &#34;Hollywood&#34; screenplay.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Everyone's nightmare, but cute way to approach this. It was very much a fantasy, but it did make me think how would I handle the situation.
B00B19DMUE|3.0|I found the film to be predictable and not in the slightest bit scary. In many places, I actually found it dull.<br /><br />So why the three stars then?<br /><br />Because one thing I *did* like was that this wasn't the same exorcism movie we've seen remade constantly since the success of the biggie in the seventies. This possession is different. It comes from the canon of a different religion, and it's brought about for different reasons from the ones we're used to seeing. As such, while it didn't entertain me per se, it *did* interest me. In fact, I found myself checking out Wikipedia during the film just to read up on the subject matter. That is way cool! :)<br /><br />Also, while the film was, as I said, kind of dull, to be fair it's not the actors' fault. The acting is quite competent, particularly the gentleman who played the father. I really liked his character and felt for him.<br /><br />So I guess I'd say watch it if it's on, but don't go out of your way to see it. This would be an excellent film to catch on Amazon Prime. :-)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Read this. You will think about what was read for many days afterward. Loved the appendix in the back as more proof.
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|Frankenweenie is classic Tim Burton - Well-written, well-directed, and well-produced - though a bit dull at times. We enjoyed the whole thing but would have enjoyed a more daring cast of characters. i.e., Some characters are unimaginative and too predictable, making the story move too slowly.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I like it when it was shown on Stars I am into the martial arts so this type of movie/series fits into what I like
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This hilarious, heart-warming story of an aspiring super-villain, his three unwitting accomplices, and his minions is suitable for the kids and the adults. This animated feature is on-par with &#34;Toy Story&#34; and &#34;Hoodwinked&#34; (though a little less edgy than the later of the two).
0525953728|2.0|I've only made to page 40 something.  So far too much back story and arrogant self praise for my taste.  If I ever pick up the book I may update my review.  This book gets a fart sound for a rating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I I enjoyed this book. Very easy to read.  Good character development and story.  Real page turner.  Would recommend for any age reader.
0307594165|5.0|The only complaint i have is it was to short!! I want to know more about the people in this book! I have all of Toni'sbooks and if you have not read her books...hurry up and get to reading!! you will be hooked!
B000000XBC|5.0|This second volume of Creedence Clearwater Revival's best is every bit as good as the first. While containing some great hits, as well as some lesser known tunes, this collection represents an important rock band at the apex of their popularity. The Fogerty brothers are still in top form and had a meteoric rise in a very short amount of time. Do yourself a favor and complete your collection of CCR favorites!
B003D5X3VM|4.0|I love this man and his music. His first one BE GOOD was just fabulous...this one was okay better than most but not as good as Be Good
B00138KKP8|4.0|I love Ray LaMontagne, so when this CD went up for $2.99 I jumped on it. I'm in school (broke), but I had to get this! It's a steal! Ray has a smooth, relaxing voice that calms me when I'm stressed, which is frequently. This CD is great from beginning to end. I only wish there were a couple more of the peppy tunes.
B007PAAO0Y|2.0|I am so sorry he made this one. Of course he is not the singer he used to be but this was just terrible.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|That's what my obit will read if I don't stop playing this game! I'm a new casualty -- er -- I mean fan. But this really gets my heart pumpin' though! Pounding, actually! I'm new to Temple Run and never played the first one. So as a new fan, I have to say, I'm hooked! And I'm still trying to figure out if that's a good thing. This thing REALLY gets my anxiety going, and my heart racing! That ugly monster is right on my heels and trying to eat me alive!!!! OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!! The controls work nicely and are quite responsive -- I didn't get eaten once because they failed me -- just because I kept screwing up! But dang, it's fun! I tried Panda Run awhile back, just cuz I love pandas, and it was clearly an unplayable knockoff by comparison. This one is highly refined. The 3D graphics are excellent. Landscapes are beautifully done. Game play is smooth, crisp and fast paced.<br /><br />It's like being Indiana Jones; swinging, jumping, sliding... RUNNING... and in my case... getting EATEN by that evil monster.... a lot! So what if I stole his idol!?! WTF dude! Is that really justification to keep munching on me and pickin' your teeth with my bones!?!? Duuuude!!?? I'm not nearly good enough at this to speak to how the game progresses. And I never played the first one, so I can't make any meaningful comparisons. But I can say, as a new victim -- er -- I mean, player, this game stands up on its own. No diff if you've played before or not -- this one is fun! I think I'll definitely burn calories and get a cardio workout playing this one, cuz my heart rate spikes and stays there until I stop playing! This things gonna give me grey hairs, or even kill me! Pump up my oxygen hubby (literally) cuz I gotta play Temple Run again! Is this thing doctor approved?!?! Hope I don't end up a headline -- disabled man dies playing Temple Run2. How's that for PR. For sure game downloads would spike with that one. Play it if you dare!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much! I can't wait to get the unicorn! &amp; get a lot more horses! I rate this game as five stars!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|One of the best apps of its kind that I've personally tried.  Excellent list of sounds that loop to perfection.  Very nice indeed.  Just wish it didn't force me to view it on portrait mode -- tablets are all about landscape.  The Burn Prevention is an essential addition. VERY cool that you can adjust the clock color and brightness with simple swipes; left/right, and up/down respectively.  Good choice of colors and luminosity range, from super bright, to barely perceptible. Only flaw -- is the Burn Prevention only seems to float the clock readout up and down, which is actually pretty ineffective.  You can still get screen burn that way; it really needs to move more fluidly around the screen to be effective.  If not for that and the forced portrait mode, this app would be near perfect for my purposes.  Still the best I've personally tried, however.  Some interesting sounds too, like dishwashers, vacuums and wind turbines. Very nice indeed.  This is a 5 star app, but I'm being picky cuz I really dislike the forced portrait mode and limited Burn Prevention motion.  Seem like easy fixes though.  Top notch app.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|i downloaded this movie and it was a very good quality and it downloaded really fast, i love this movie
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It keeps me on track with all of my studies and reminds me when I have missed something.  And it goes with me everywhere.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|the quality of the pictures isnt that good but i didnt expect much any way since its on the kindle
145210655X|5.0|The cartoons are hysterical, and the book a real joy!  I highly recommend it as a gift for fellow star war addicts, like myself!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My granddaughter loves the magic of Disney. She is 3 years old and can't wait to visit the Disney \\"castle\\" and visit with all the princess's and fairies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the site just wish I could unpin choices, if someone could tell us how to that would be great
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|My kids really enjoyed this movie. Even my teenage got into the movie and was laughing along with the rest of us.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A VERY good read.  I loved the detail.  Could see the town, the children, the store.  Can't wait to see the movie coming out in February.  My first Nicholas Sparks.......won't be my last!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I choose a five because it kept me entertained while having a great ending wish there were more books of this serious
0316228532|3.0|Lots of people and behind the sceans interaction like Harry Potter, but not exciting and full of bad language to make it an &#34;adult&#34; book.
B005LAII1C|5.0|i love seth macfarlanes work this is a crude and rude raunchy comedy i love it and all things seth does.
0439023513|5.0|There is so much symbolism in this book. It's so entertaining for me to read. This whole series is amazing.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|THIS GAME SUCKS FIX THIS TILT TO GET COIN GLITCH I TILTED IT AND NOTHING HAPPENED WHAT THE HELL!!!! This never happened on my old kindle fire get this fixed or I'll never play a imagni studios game EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|nice cloth band with reinforcement around the buckle holes, keeps great time and date is easy to keep up. Stays wound even though I don't wear it all the time. Went a day without wearing and it stopped the next but it is a wind up by wrist motion and I didn't wear it. I keep scratching the crystal though, but my fault.
0066620996|5.0|Bought this book for a MBA class and loved it!! It is a must read for anyone in the business world.
B000002WPI|5.0|It is the Wu-Tang Clan, it has some of the classic joints with the classic members.  If you are from then or know and love the Wu, you will love this. Wu-Tang is forever.
B005LAII12|3.0|It was funny at times but not hillarious. The story line was pretty good. Overall decent movie but dont spend 20.00 on it
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I am not sure why there were so many bad reviews. I enjoyed it.  It is definitely worth a watch.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I'm not much into romance, but this one was a great read.. Mostly because it felt more like a comic romance with a seductive twist.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Good book like it amazing how many people have read this dictionary of useful information about the world and all of the defining I do in school and it comes in handy with everything it's truly amazing
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much better than the original (and temple run brave). With new,  great, very noticeable difference between the graphics in it, it's very awesome, less predictable and the new obstacles and landscapes improve the gameplay and likeability. Highly suggested for everyone of all ages.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I had difficulty getting all the objects needed.  When I tried to locate them it looked like they were picked up but never made it to my inventory.  There seems no way to backtrack with resetting the game and starting over.  If it wasn't for that I would have enjoyed the game with it's great scenes, graphics and music.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I had chosen a 5 star rating because this author and story earns it.  I mean I feel really bad for the orphans but this is leaving me at the edge of my seat.  This ending was not at all happy but that's what I love about this book, it's out of the ordinary.  Lemony (the author) was talking to the reader it something you don't read much.  And how this book left me hanging was the best part, because I've never been so excited for a book in my life. I would recommend this book to a friend who loves to read books but she reads books that she doesn't pick out ,her mom does but her mom actually has a great taste in books so I hope she will be able to get this book on her kindle.
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|The band hyped this album over the past couple of months, and for good reason.  Like Suffer, the songs are concise, well written,  and in your face.  On first listen, the quality of the songs may pass you by.  It is definitely one that grows on you as you have the chance to catch all of the nuiances.  Lyrically and vocally, this ranks up there with their latter albums as Greg and company nail all of the &#34;oozzzinawws&#34;.  Definitely a buy for any fan.
B005HSL626|4.0|Got this because my daughter played it on someone elses kindle and she liked it.  And you don't need the wifi to run it.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I am a huge fan of Castle, since I started watching it, I have been hooked. I now own all of the seasons that have been released. Since we are in the middle of Season 5 right now...I will have to wait until this summer to get season 5.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughters like this game also.  And it makes them think which I like.  And you don't need wifi to run it.  I like when other people let you know this before you purchase a game
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Again I am a huge fan of this series, and many other with Nathen Filion. Including Firefly....all of us Firefly geeks will enjoy this series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am so glad I got this game cuz my daughter just loves this game.  She wants to play it all the time and get as many points as she can so she can unlock a new game with the points she earns she just loves that.  and you don't need to be on wifi to play it.
0307950689|5.0|I really liked this book. I am a Freemason, and I am a Knights Templar. So I find this kind of stuff fascinating. I am glad that Dan Brown put my fraternity in a good light for a change. There is some truth in this mixed with some fiction. I will not confirm nor deny what is truth though. lol. Thank you Dan Brown, for showing Masonry in such a positive light, and debunking a lot of the Conspiracies out there about us.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good read  it has a Compelling plot and sympathetic characters.<br />Could not put it down. Looking forward to book 3
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have been using this app for more than a year now and find that it has lots of variety and like it very much.
B0055SWM08|5.0|My 9 year old son and I love this game. We compete over who can finish the rounds in the least amount of moves without using a hint. It gets your mind working in a peaceful, tranquil environment.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A good way to pass the time. You have  to get to the higher levels before its challenging for adults.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|OK...this is not a literary read, so if you are looking for an academic read, this isn't it.  But the story is so fabulous, and the writer really connected me to these men and their story.  As a woman, and someone not into &#34;war&#34; stories, I loved it.  I have recommended it to many friends.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|The weight and size of it is perfect for writing notes on my ipad.  It's a good price and great quality!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Patchworkz provides a ingenious puzzle experience. The puzzles are works of art. Perfect for killing a few minutes while waiting at the airport. The challenge rounds are tough.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun gAme easy to play. Great for killing time and puzzle lovers. I recommend it to anyone interested in quick fun games
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this book given the description but it intrigued me so I got it anyway. From the start my interest was held. I rarely stay up late reading but I couldn't put it down. The characters, Sky and Holder, are so real you feel like you know them. The amazing chemistry between them was incredible. Well worth the read. This is a book I will want to read again.
0142403873|4.0|One of my friends recommended this book after she read one of my four-year-old son's stories.  She thought he might like it and be able to relate to the mouse.  She was very right.  My son scares away scary monkeys and other terrifying creatures in his stories.  He certainly can relate to this mouse.<br /><br />I read that Julia Donaldson originally planned for the gruffalo to be a tiger, but had to create a gruffalo to fit her rhyming scheme.  I am so glad that she did.  The mystery of the gruffalo builds the suspense of this tale.  This book pays homage to Sendak's \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\", but still stands easily on its own.  The rhyme and meter are well done and the conclusion is quite satisfying.<br /><br />The illustrations by Axel Scheffler also pay homage to Sendak, but they, again, stand very well on their own.  All the expressions and emotions of the mouse are conveyed by the eyes, tail and arms -- everything else remains almost static.  It is a very effective technique. The gruffalo is scary, but not too scary; he does look as if he might be tricked by a clever mouse.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad my friend recommended this book.  It makes a delightful addition to my son's library.
B007V65R54|4.0|I've always been interested in the intersection of the subjective and objective.<br /><br />There are a few slow parts , mostly when I didn't understand a field being used as an example. But there is relatively little jargon to know to understand and appreciate the main points.
B001H4NXCK|5.0|My husband hasn't seen this movie (WHAT?!) and I just had to buy it because its a classic! SUper fast shipping. Thank you!
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|The Game was an excellent movie, and I recommend all of David Fincher's movies, even Alien 3.  Michael Douglas was fantastic.
0307592731|5.0|It has been many many years since I wandered the mountains on my own two feet-never able to be without at least a dog at my side to ease the often painful sense of insignificance that one gets in the grand bowl of nature.<br /><br />I laughed, I cried, I wanted to hug her through her brave attempt to pull herself out of the very deep hole she had dug for herself, personally, emotionally, spiritually and physically.<br /><br />It is a poignant, and honest \\"coming of age story\\" out of the personal decade that many of us have struggled to make sense of if we survived it. Cheryl put herself in a place of no choice-to face her demons head on-prepared or not-without quarter.<br /><br />We can poke at her naivete, her lack of preparation on some levels, her permiscuity, her heroin addiction and relational issues-but in the end-as a mother, and daughter myself-I know such powerful grief, on an intelligent, creative child-come young woman-of course has dire consequences. To not disintegrate into a puddle of pious apology-but to take life head on and mend what one can-is the best of the best.<br /><br />So many continue to seek solace in drugs, relational pergatory and brutilization visited on the next generation.  Cheryl somehow knew putting one painful step in front of another and re-connecting to her center was going to be the only thing to help her make sense of remaining on the planet..a beautiful, often brutal and paradoxical ride.  I loved this book-it gives me much faith in the human spirit.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Not everyone has a cable company thathas a tivo like opportunity at a reasonable price.<br />And or when the power goes outor your dvd does not work properly.<br />So I appreciate live streaming so I can see the end of a program missed due to either the cableor power company
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love Angry Birds, the piggies, not so much.  It's a great game for all ages.  The sound effects are humerous and the graphics are great.  There are enough levels to keep your interest.  I highly recommend it.
030758836X|2.0|As a fan of Gillian Flynn's other books, I was really looking forward to this one--only to be horribly disappointed after I finished it.  Flynn is a very talented writer; her dialogue sounds natural, she has a unique way with words, and she really gets into the heads of the hip 30-something generation. I thought her first novel, Sharp Objects, was one of the best mysteries I've read in years. Her second book, Dark Places, wasn't quite as good but it was still enjoyable. Gone Girl, however, just stinks in every way a book can stink.  I only gave it two stars instead of one because I enjoy her writing style so much.<br /><br />The book has many problems.  First, it's way too long.  Shame on the editor who didn't cut out 50 to 75 pages of fluff (detailed descriptions of characters who disappear after a few chapters and have nothing to do with the plot, entire scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, long internal monologues that have nothing to do with the plot).<br /><br />Second, the book does not have multiple plot twists as other reviews have stated.  It has one plot twist, which takes place in the middle of the book as opposed to the end of the book. This is not a who-dunnit mystery.  We find out \\"who-dunnit\\" halfway through the book, and from that point on there is no mystery to solve.<br /><br />Third, nearly every character in this book is unlikeable.  There is no one to root for or sympathize with.  Every person is annoying, mean-spirited, insane, or a combination of the three.<br /><br />Fourth, the ending was absolutely terrible.  There actually is no \\"ending,\\" the book just stops in mid-plot as if Flynn had no idea how to end it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it looks like Flynn's first book will always be her best.  I hope she gets back on track eventually, but I won't hold my breath.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This series is full of suprizes, keeps you guessing!!!  Superb acting and a treat to watch, Emily Van Camp - have enjoyed watching her grow in her abilities - she was on Brothers and SIsters
0307716988|5.0|Moonwalk was an amazing book about Michael Jackson, I insist you read it. The book tells you all about his life and how he grew up, the book shows that it is hard in life even before you are a super-star and that you can get through it. The book is appropriate for all ages and is an amazing auto-biography by Michael Jackson. If you are a fan you will LOVE this book, you can learn so much about him, and I insist you read it.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book was very well written as are all of Jodi Picoult's books. The story was sad and uplifting at times. I highly recommend this one!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is my absolute favorite game. I particularily like how you can shuffle the remaining tiles to get a match.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book! It was well written and fast paced. I'm very anxious for the next one to come out this spring!
B004AHNIGM|5.0|This one I enjoyed. It reminded me of the old days. Before all the money and all the stash. Pure music. I've moved it to the CD changer in the car. One of my top six I guess.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love the whole story and how it talked about love and how strong a love for someone can be.  I couldn't put it down, read it in one day.  :)
B007N85ZXY|5.0|I enjoyed listening to Neil and Friends take on songs I remember singing in the car as we were all take our yearly trek to Gandma's. I liked his version better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book, it had me hooked on it since I started reading it.  It gives all those woman out there that are abuse the strenght to be able to walk away.  I love it and can't wait for the movie.
031603441X|4.0|It was mostly what I figured. Someone else's memories of Keef's life as a Stone as he was told it happened. The basic, sex drugs and a whole lot of Rock n Roll. But which one of us in that circle weren't expecting much?<br />Time to crank it up again. I wonder if he'll know it's actually 2013? He don't care, long as he gets his check and someone gets him to the gigs he's happy. I've enjoyed watching him more than Mick.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a really good game. I have been play for a while and have had no problems play it. it's also good for kids not thing bad and simple.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love how many thing you can do<br />Though I wish there were more horse breeds<br />I play before I go to bed. thanks for the app
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is amazing. it actually feels like ur taking care of a horse. consider getting it!! u get to start off with a beutiful horse named beuaty!!
1118156315|3.0|I have already started my business and I thought this book would help me with furthering my business.  It has great tips and tools but is better for people trying to decide what their life passion is so they can create their own business.  If you already have your business running there is little advice that will help.  But it is great for those trying to feel out what business they want to be in.
1451608659|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Easy to read.  Makes you feel like you are there with the athletes.  Would recommend this book. Excellent writers.  They did a fabulous job!
B003B02O3C|4.0|Even though the story line was a continual string of too-perfect-to-even-believe circumstances, it was a fun and interesting read and still showed off Grishams ability to tell a good story.  I actually found myself impressed that this easy, elementary approach still had me wanting to get to the next page and I was wishing it was longer so that I could continue to enjoy it.  He does know his craft, for sure. A little different than the high excitement of some of his other novels, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|What's not to love about portable interest?<br />I you use the website and have a mobile device.... it's a no trainer!
B007TK77QE|5.0|JK Rowling has written a book as accomplished as that of any writer. I found this book to be difficult to put down. The only and its a small only problem  I had at first was getting my head around who was who as there is a very long cast of characters. Excellent plot. Deals with a raft of topical issues. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes a good yarn.
B00138F080|3.0|I bought it because of Electric Feel but the rest of the album is not my taste.<br />I should have spent more time listening to the samples before buying.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Yes, it has &#34;The A Team,&#34; but there are also some other great tunes on this album, with a nice balance of upbeat and slower tunes.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I always liked this movie and the past two Christmas Seasons they did not Air it on T.V. so I bought it.
B002RHGYOA|3.0|The book is too narrative about the police procedures and investigations. Otherwise it is a good thriller. The childhood days of Lisbeth is revealed in this book.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I loved this album! I just saw him in Houston this past Thursday and he put on a great show! You must be crazy if you don't love this.
B009EP3DJM|1.0|I have to admit, I'm not the target audience for an album like this. However, my GF left it in my car's stereo so I decided to give it a listen. And yes, I did listen to the album...I'm not just \\"bashing\\" for no reason. I actually listened to it from front to back 3 times.<br /><br />I don't really get Kesha (and I refuse to put a stupid dollar sign every time I type her name). What's her message, exactly? This album is utterly confusing. In between songs about sleeping around with random men, she decides to toss in a love song. Kinda hard to take a love song as genuine when she repeatedly reminds the listener that she just wants to \\"get in your dirty sheets\\" with random Joes.<br /><br />It's not just that stuff that confuses. It's also the fact that she constantly talks about \\"fighting\\" like she's some part of movement for misunderstood youth. What exactly are you fighting for, Kesha? Why do you insist on starting some sort of revolution? A revolution for what? Promiscuous women getting drunk?<br /><br />She also talks about the \\"simpler times\\" and how she misses them...like when she had no goals and lived in her car and (surprise) had sex with random dudes. She misses being a screw-up slut? Well at least now she at least has money, I suppose.<br /><br />The lyrics leave absolutely nothing to the imagination. It's actually cringe-worthy just how bad of a lyricist she is. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think that somebody with a dollar sign in their name would be some sort of epic wordsmith, but still. Just like her messages, many of her lyrics really have no purpose or meaning or make sense. \\"Shoot the lights out like a machine gun\\" comes to mind. What the hell is she even talking about? Or how about \\"Cut you like a knife, kill you like a dagger\\"? I don't know about you, but I haven't seen a dagger since Lord of the Rings. Knifes are actually much more common weapons...and they kill you just as well as daggers from sword & sorcery novels.<br /><br />Speaking of lyrics, I don't even think she knows what to put in half her songs. One track is basically the same lyrics/song and then simply repeated. It's like she wrote half a song and just hit \\"repeat\\" during the recording session. Seriously. And why does she insist on repeating words in so many of her tracks? Annoying.<br /><br />Her voice teeters between god-awful and decent enough for a mass-produced manufactured pop star. That's, of course, when she actually sings...which she only does for about half the album if that. A large part of her vocal \\"prowess\\" includes talking over a beat and rapping. Her rapping vocals make her sound like some spoiled suburban brat that hates their parents because they got her an iPhone 4S for Christmas and not an iPhone 5 and now the world is ending. At least that's the image I got in my head.<br /><br />There's really absolutely nothing of value here, IMO.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book gave me chills, pissed me off and made me cry. I loved it. I can't wait to see the movie.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|no problems good way to pass time fun enjoy the games almost like eighties era games recommend for anyone looking for non complicated play.
B001BANK32|3.0|This book had enough to hold my attention and was creepy, but not what I expected it to be. The characters were not developed enough that I could really care for them, and I believe that such a large hotel could hold more frightening and additional ghosts or monsters. I found \\"The Shining\\" enjoyable, but it does not hold a candle to \\"Pet Sematary\\" or\\"'Salem's Lot.\\"
B003TSEEDY|5.0|THIS BOOK IS SO PERFECT  GOD HELP ME. FIVE STARS FOR THIS BOOK IT IS SO AMAZING JUST WOW OKAY.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Fun. is definitely one of my favorite new alt bands, and this is a quality album. You can definitely just put it on and let it play. For $4, you can't beat it.

1603427244|5.0|This handy book is small enough to fit in my knitting bag.  It's handy to pull out and quickly look up a cast on or bind off.  Accurate descriptions with pictures.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a very suspenseful book and had lots of action.<br />I wouldn't change anything.<br />I would recommend it to almost anyone.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's really cool, and it even tells you the weather. Good app. No glitches and it doesn't show lots of ads like that others.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Comes with a nice sampling of sounds, including a purring cat. You  can also create them and download others for free. Oh, and the app completely exits when I hit Pause. Galaxy S3 and Tab 8.9.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I'm a geek and engineer so I loved this book.<br />Andy brought such realistic scenarios to survival with factual information where he could include it which makes it very believable. This should be required reading for all future astronauts.<br /><br />It was well written and the characters were quite believable.<br /><br />The book remided me of the movies &#34;Robinson Curoso on Mars&#34; and &#34;Red Planet&#34; with Val Kilmer.  ...only the book was better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game ..its wondful the picture and everything! !!!!! the best game so far ..my boyfriend played all night ...
B009SH5JS4|5.0|This movie so funny and so exciting,I watch it so much time at TV,and collect the DVD and BD,because it's my favorite movie
B006LSZECO|1.0|The writer had the perfect opportunity to end the story long before the so called \\"ending\\".  I felt my time had been robbed in reading a book that brought no pleasure, taught nothing, and therefore served no purpose.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|Author and series have been one of my favorites over the years. After several chapters into this, I put it aside. Too dark. MAYBE I'll try it again, otherwise money not well spent.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app has been great for helping me in my meditation and yoga practices. I like the fact there are several choices you can custom mix to your preference in addition to having the deeper sound waves for dream and meditation states. I'm enjoying experimenting! Very highly recommend this for ANYONE looking to relax their mind and soul.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|When I first purchased this I had rouble getting it installed. I soulved that problem by consulting customer service.  Everything works fine now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just downloaded it and I don't know why I waited so long. It is so relaxing to justbsit and take care of horses without the smell.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great starter version for Angry Birds. It was a little easier than the traditional version. Look for the secret level...
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A bit more disjointed than the other books, but still quite good.<br />The ending was more realistic and not as positive as it was setting up to be. The epilogue turned that around, which I was happy about.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an good book to read for those who like the movies, and what to get those small details to fit into the missing parts. This book is recommended for young readers/teens.
B00796E7CA|5.0|lots of background information. If the Lord of The Rings is what you like then this the book for you.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The story between the characters was written great. I didn't expect the twist and turns in the story. It made me laugh and cry and smile. Great writing!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Love season three! The plots thicken even more (though some characters start to get a little tiresome, ahem), and the fantastic costume and set design is better than ever. The cast is clearly at the top of their game. You won't be disappointed!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Ms Collins deserves high praise for Catching Fire.  The book is very well written, and stands up to The Hunger Games.  Great action sequences as well as wonderful emotional moments.  A great YA novel in which someone like me, a thirty year old grad student, or my mom, a sixty year old middle school teacher, can get completely, utterly involved.  Highly recommended!
B003WWZ148|5.0|Great Vinyl!!! If you love Cash than this record is for you! Treat yourself to the great sound of the man in black!
B0044C5Q9K|5.0|What else do you want? If you're smart, you will laugh.  If you are stupid, you'll go watch Family Guy.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|Adele has that rich 60s feel to her voice.. lots of soul. this vinyl makes me feel like i'm back in the 1960s when listening to it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great writing again! You just CANNOT put these books down. Mitch Rapp is the hero we all would like to be. The crusader on his white charger says and does what is right, and to hell with everyone else. Fortunately, on the side of good, Vince Flynn shows why people like Mitch exist and how important their role is in protecting us all. Vince Flynn's novels remnid me of great food. Takes hours to prepare and minutes to consume! But well worth the wait.
B005URRCNQ|5.0|Great Vinyl!!! If you love the Black Keys this record is for you! Love jamming to this record. You might find vinyl is a dying format but you'll be in for a treat when you buy one.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I liked and enjoyed it very much and have already recommended it to several friends.It was an easy read and holds your interest.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is like a second adventure for the first temple run players but I noticed a glitch. When you jump over the gap on a bridge, if you hit the rope on the side you die<br />But altogether it's very nice
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My goodness what a great book! I went into this eyes open. I could not be more amazed at what an amazing book this is!  Could not put it down. Do yourself a favor and read it.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|Having had a NDE my self with nothing to report except I was told by the head of ICU they did nothing to bring me back, were ready to administer appropriate drug & crash cart but I brought myself back were his words. I have no recollection. Eben's experience is brilliantly told & believer or not it is a compelling account of his experience. A great book
030758836X|4.0|I didn't love this book, but I also couldn't put it down.  When I got to the end I was glad I didn't.  Overall a good read, just took a while to get into it.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|The book is an excellently written insight in a guy who touched the world in new Technology and it quite obvious it is only the tip of the iceberg the path Steve has sent us on. RIP Steve God be with you!
0143035711|5.0|I first encountered Robert Mason's writings when I read his Solo books, which are about a renegade army robot. Although Chickenhawk comes from under the same pen, it is a very, very different book. For one, not only it is not science-fiction, it is not even fiction. The book recounts the author's one-year tour of duty in Vietnam as a helicopter pilot in 1965/66.<br /><br />Chickenhawk starts with the author undergoing his helicopter training and ends with a quick summary of his life as a burned out, troubled Vietnam veteran. But the lion's share of the book is about that one year in Vietnam. Like with most war memoirs, there is no plot. The author recounts flying transport missions, moving troops and supplies in and out of combat zones. When not flying, the pilots spend their time constructing their base, attending to day-to-day affairs of military life and goofing around.<br /><br />I was struck by how isolated the pilots were from the war. Of course, they were exposed to combat when flying their missions, but when on the ground, they stayed inside (relatively) secure bases. They were not the ones who had to defend those bases, repel nighttime Vietcong attacks and go out on patrols. And even when flying, their exposure to combat lasted only for hours, sometimes only minutes. Although the pilots themselves might disagree, they definitely had it better than the grunts stuck on the ground fighting for days if not weeks.<br /><br />Nor do the pilots have much contact with the Vietnamese. American infantrymen had to go on long patrols and quite often camped in the countryside. As such, they encountered Vietnamese peasants (who made up most of Vietnam's population) all the time, and, for better or worse, they had to deal and live with them. The pilots meet Vietnamese only very briefly, when they are on leave. And the Vietnamese they encounter are: peddlers trying to sell them something, prostitutes and bark workers pouring them beer.<br /><br />It is no wonder that the pilots, despite being wounded and killed quite often, treat the war with certain detachment. They are of course scared of flying into enemy territory and they don't like it when one of them gets hurt, but the impression I got was that their emotional involvement in the conflict was not as intense as that of the grunts on the ground (whose memoirs I have read as well).<br /><br />This is not a criticism. This is just an observation and it does not make the book either good or bad. Chickenhawk depicts life of a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, and that life was as it was. You can approve or disapprove of it, but that does not change the reality. What I can guarantee is that the book is interesting. It has some small weaknesses. There are a lot of characters and sometimes you forget who is who. The author, having a passion for flying helicopters, sometimes goes too deep into technical details on how to fly a helicopter. But overall, this is a good, interesting \\"story\\" of brave men doing whatever they can, quite often at great personal risk, in order to help their fellow soldiers fighting a war that should have never been fought to begin with.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending I didn't expect it.  Was hard to put down I read it in a day. Ready to read more by this author.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|&#34;The Scorch Trials&#34;, was interesting and easy reading.  The book kept me me wanting to find out what was going to happen.  I liked the main characters.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This is a great movie. I know that streaming is a simpler way to enjoy movies now a days but i just can help the feeling that physically owning something brings. I now own a great movie I saw in a theater on a wonderful date with my wife. I own a great memory and a movie to go with it.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|I did not care for this book.  Almost everyone dies.  No escape or cure.  The repetition of death got old.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I love this movie and I know that DVD's are a dying media but I can't help but love this movie in a form that delivers all the drama and effects in super bright and clear picture like it was intended to be viewed.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|I like the main characters in the story, but it started getting old with no cure insight.  The end left things unfinished.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You really have to try this app and if you do not like the app then just delete it for heaven sake, it's free  delete it if u do not like it, but you have to try this app. It IS AN AWESOME app . Please try this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B004P7CN7W|5.0|As of the date of this review there are 310 review on this movie. I think that about says it. This movie was so epic I went around telling everyone about it. Definitely a must watch. Only one iffy part in the whole movie, which is RARE considering that many movies are filled with iffy things!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is awesome. I how they all ways throw out main characters it makes things so dramatic. Sorry about the spelling I'm only 8 NO joke I'm using my dad's kindle fire to read this
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I first met Gene Kim at Velocity 2011, where I saw him give a talk about operational excellence.  About a year and a half later, at another event, I finally came to him and told him how angry his talk made me.  At the time of his talk, what I heard him argue for is rigidity, inflexibility, and avoidance of any sort of creativity or agility.<br /><br />In hindsight, this is hilarious.<br /><br />I've got a few issues with this book; the effort to have the characters stand for a particular IT mindset resulted in all characters being cliched; Gene occasionally hits the reader over the head with a big baseball bat to make sure the reader gets the point he's trying to make.  Look, I'll be honest: If Gene was trying to write a standard work of fiction, rather than a parable, I'd say he's pretty average.  On the other hand, nobody's buying this book because they're looking for a good thriller to cuddle up with.<br /><br />Other reviewers have, far more eloquently than I could, already talked about the great points this book makes.  I agree with all of them, though I'll note that I think it's one of those books you really should commit to finishing (it's not that long.  It'll be easy.  It's riveting), because in the process of the protagonists (Bill, Wes, Patty) getting to the desired end state, they make some decisions and turns that are decidedly suboptimal and -- frankly -- horrifying.  A good example of this is deciding that the only way they can manage the impact of their star performer is by restricting access to him and requiring the approval of the VP of IT (or the star's boss) to simply TALK with him.  And that's not just for the whole organization -- that's for the tier 3 engineers who are supposed to learn from him.  It's a classic \\"we have no clue how to manage our environment, so we'll put more controls in place so we can feel we can manage what's going on\\" maneuver, and I really wish Gene was more explicit in calling this out as the wrong thing.<br /><br />Gene does get to the good stuff, though, and the thing that makes this book so fantastic -- the thing that makes me gush about this book more than I've gushed about any other management or technology book in my memory -- is that the way he does this is incredibly accessible to a broad set of people from a broad set of technology disciplines.  I've done my time in a sixty year old accounting company where IT management talked ITIL all day and tried to plan work effort nine months in advance.  They'll get value from this book.  I work in a company at the forefront of the DevOps trend and this book verbalizes how we think about things -- and how we should continue to improve.<br /><br />Being an ITIL heretic (I believe ITIL's worth is not in forcing more structure, but in defining the common issues that concern everyone in technology and allowing them to collaborate better to address these issues -- almost the opposite of what most ITIL practitioners (certainly the certified ones) seem to believe); being an ardent believer in the power of superstar performers to do great things when completely unleashed from stupid, cumbersome process; and being a religious zealot when it comes to believing in the power of automation to remove the need to do the same thing a whole bunch of times (each time finding a slightly different, inconsistent solution to a problem), I've seen no manifesto that so purely distills my point of view, that so clearly speaks for me and what I believe in.<br /><br />Gene, I owe you a beer.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I gave Hopeless 4 stars I thoroughly enjoyed this book,  I will definitely read more of Colleen Hooper's books in the future.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was hesitant to watch and catch up on the series. I started watching on amazon. It's amazing how the story lines expand and how the lives of the individuals are presented. Anything can happen, very suspenseful (as I'm trying not to give away any plot lines to not ruin te surprises.) yes the zombies can be gory but what did you expect from walkers
B000FC130E|3.0|After reading the free preview pages I was anxious to purchase the book on Kindle and read it.  I rarely spend more than $4 on any Kindle book and so this was a treat for me.  However, once I got past where the free pages left off the book took stranger and stranger turns.  I had a hard time buying into the world the author created.  At times I forced myself to keep going just because I paid for it.  By the final 1/3 of the book, it did come together and form a cohesive narrative.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hopeless was an amazingly beautiful book. It was so great to read and it made me cry. A lot. It was so sad and moving and heartbreaking. And I loved how everything connected back to sky's past. The only thing that I didn't like about the book was the way sky and holder talked to each other. It was obvious that they had a very deep relationship but towards the end I just felt like the dialogue between them was a little too dramatic. Like it sounded more like a really really deep letter that you would write to someone and not an actual conversation. Also I wish that Six and Breckin had been included more. I kind of felt like it was a loose end there. But, you know all in all it was a great great book. I loved it. And it's one of those books that I'm going to re read it in a couple of months. For sure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is awesome and so much fun and you can have a great time on it.
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver is both insightful and subtle.  As he effectively points out, it is important not only to know what you know, but also to know what you don't know.  I enjoyed this book a great deal and I highly recommend it.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I first learned of Howl and Sofie because I saw the movie and loved them all,  it the book gives more I site to there lives and love. This is a great read.

B00B19DMUE|4.0|This movie is pretty interesting, along the lines of The Exorcist only with a Jewish twist. Young actresses doing alright reminding me of a young Lindsay Lohan and Anna Paquin. The plot is good and it is a well produced movie.
B000U1ZV3U|1.0|This Blu-Ray release shows how little studios care for their products, as long as they can grab a quick buck.  The full, uncut version of this film is far better, but was made available only on VHS and LaserDisc (both widescreen).  I assumed that the theatrical version DVD would eventually be followed by a Blu-Ray that contained the uncut version - especially now that branching technology would probably make it possible for both versions to be on one disc.  Even if that were not the case, it should have been either a single disc of the uncut (we already have the cut DVD), or, better, a two-disc set with both versions.  The extra cost to the studio would be minimal.  As it is, yet another chance to spend your money on a butchered version of a film you'd enjoy and appreciate better in its full form.  Sadly, this is never likely to get the Criterion treatment, and be released as it should be seen (as \\"Heaven's Gate was earlier this year).<br /><br />Some people will say the uncut version is too long, but anyone who can sit through, and enjoy, the 190 minutes of this version would not be disappointed to spend 212 minutes on the better cut.  As it is, they have much of the material in the form of irritating \\"Deleted scenes\\" in the extras. Forget this studio money-spinner, which is no significant improvement on the previous DVD (no added extras - another opportunity for historical documentary material missed) , and buy the VHS [[ASIN:6303431038 Wyatt Earp (Widescreen Expanded Edition) [VHS]]] on Amazon, or the LaserDisc [[ASIN:B000WKQUXO Wyatt Earp Laserdisc]].

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|it is hard to find a game that plays smoothly on the Kindle Fire.  This game plays well and has hidden object scenes that are well defined and easy to see.  You do have to purchase the full version to finish the game but it does offer quite a bit of play time for free.
B00AYE8C70|5.0|This is one of the best downloads ever. Really works good on my Samsung Galaxy Note. I highly recommend it.

0345529057|5.0|The books are an amazing read and they are not joking when they say George R. R. Martin is this generations J.R.R.Tolkien.  The 4 books came in a somewhat sturdy box, no complaints here, and all of the books were in perfect condition.  If you are looking for a good book to read, I highly recommend these.
B002KKCW04|5.0|Wore these in the ocean, on the beach, long walks, to dinner, in the pool, everywhere! Super comfortable for a really big-foot guy!
B001GXNBJW|5.0|....if you KNOW you're going to be listing to an album (yes I still call them albums) for the rest of your life, it has to be a 5 star. Whenever I listen to Rubber Factory I think: raw, pure, perfect. And, if you're looking for your first Black Keys cd to buy, this is the one, it was mine. Enjoy.
B005I6EU48|4.0|The Verso Prologue cover (fits Kindle Fire, NOT Kindle Fire HD) is a smooth leathery cover: it's a great texture, and feels like it has some substance to it.  Your Kindle Fire is held in place with four black elastic bands (one in each corner), and this case makes your Kindle look like a book (when stored spine out): from the top/bottom you can still see that it's an electronic device.  But what a nice way to protect your Kindle Fire and read on the go: would definitely recommend this great case!!
030758836X|1.0|I still have NOT received this book - still waiting.  Therefore I cannot evaluate it.  Hopefully I will receive it soon.
B004SDEP38|3.0|Is a good application but is very expensive, and is not to easy of use, if the price drop then is ok, but for 14.99 is not worth the money
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Watch Bones on computer because only 2 shows on tv worth watching tnis and Burn Notice. Everything else stinks big.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is a very entertaining game which allows you to improve while still challenging you no matter how skilled you become.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This isn't my usual kind of read but it was very well done. Nice little details that made a difference. Very touching and I enjoyed the slight suspense.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|A slight tilt on the classic bromance. Typical tension with the girlfriend.  Coarse but funny jokes. Surprisingly, at the end you really cared about the characters.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a game that u can play to unlock more games and if u don't have the patience to do that then sad for u its a good game with up to 101 games cant beat that
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Enjoyed this from beginning to end. The parts in dialect we very  enjoyable. The story wove the tail of man working to over come the frailties of man's struggles.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|It's addicting and fun. I took 12 years of piano lessons but this app is far more challenging than playing the real piano.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|My sister got me hooked on this movie. It is an absolute gem. Beautifully acted, fun plot, and I even love the musical score!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So much to do and great graphics!!! Love how it lets you actually compete with your horse. I think it looks real at some points in the game
B00170F0WU|5.0|My husband had watched this movie before, and he suggested to rent it and watch it with him. I really enjoyed this movie and I would watch it again.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like thie game.  It helps to have the brain exercising.  You have to use your organization skills to play it and find the way to fulfill all the board.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I really thought this was a teeny bopper movie but it turns out to be a movie enjoyable for all. My family watched it twice within a few days.
B005KB0SU6|4.0|It is a very interesting book.  I like how Carlos Ruiz Zafon writes.  His novels are all based in suspense.

B0060AY6FO|5.0|I thought it was on par with Austens Pride and Prejudice.  Much better than the other 'follow up' books written.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This was a decent read - quick and easy, which was what I was looking for. I don't know that I'd recommend it to others, though.
B002OMZTSU|4.0|I always liked the Late, Late Show with Craig. The autobiography tells the story of his battles (and eventual standoff) with alcohol and recreational pharmaceuticals. I did not appreciate his rough past. His triumph over his demons is a great read. His appreciation of America is inspiring.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|This is a very cute love story. i would recommend it for young teens that enjoyed reading the Twilight series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Omg awesome book! I couldn't believe all the sudden turns! One of the best books I've read!!! Couldn't stop reading because I had to fin  out what happen.

1451675046|5.0|Richard Dawkins has written this book in such an accessible style for kids. It is absolutely fantastic! I am reading it aloud to my 10-year old daughter and it is great father-daughter time. I would like my daughter to read it a second time by herself after we are done with it. What I love about the book are the examples used to illustrate the concepts, for example, Dawkins discusses a book shelf of photos of successive generations of grand parents to illustrate the concept of gradual evolution, just great! When I read my daughter the line about looking at the farthest card on the shelf and seeing the photo of a fish, my daughter burst out laughing. She will now remember the idea of gradual evolution for life! If I had had a biology teacher in high school as good at communicating as Professor Dawkins is, I may not have developed the aversion for biology that I did while in high school!
B005SZAEYO|5.0|This show had likeable characters who were well acted.  This story was a variation on the often used haunted house theme, but it felt fresh and cleverly presented.  It has very scary, violent, and sexually charged scenes, so you may want to make sure your younger children aren't around the screen.  It looks like they put a lot of money into this show and spent it wisely.<br /><br />Season two has no association with the first season except some of the actors appear in completely unrelated roles.  In my opinion, season one obliterates season two in every area.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have this on my htc one x phone just as good no problems at all.<br />I can look and see what its going to be like if I am going out of town and<br />know what to take with me so its as good as the weather on tv as this is<br />what they use too.
B009SJ46EA|3.0|I finished watching the 13th and final episode about 20 minutes ago.  After thoroughly enjoying season one, I thought season two would be a real treat.  The second season has not one, but three types of horror forces--supernatural, alien, and human slasher.  While season one provided a very likeable family to root for, season two provides way too many characters who were too loosely associated to focus on.  The problem is, you don't get to know any of the characters very well because instead of spending time developing their personalities, you mostly see them being acted upon with little ability to do anything creative.  Just couldn't get invested in any of these characters.  And the way the show tried to tie everything together felt awkward and rushed.  This maybe could've worked if they had more time, but 13 episodes that are only around 40 minutes each permits too little time to work with this ambitious of a story and characters.<br /><br />Many of the actors returned from season one, but they played completely different people in a different time period.  The acting was good, but some of the Northeastern accents were not plausible or consistent.  It was also filmed pretty well with decent music, so budget was not the problem here.<br /><br />What bothered me most was feeling preached to about the social injustices of the past, many of which continue to this day.  I don't mind stories with some kind of enlightening message, but they went way overboard with a couple of topics.  I realize many people probably felt a strong appreciation for the show going the extra mile, but I've already seen way too many dramas and documentaries about these topics (and done much, much better).  Putting these distractions in my horror entertainment with such gusto really ruined the spooky vibe I was hoping to get lost in.<br /><br />Hate to bash the show because I hope they'll do a third season.  I just hope it focuses more on horror like season one did.
B004GYY714|5.0|I decided to get this to see if I could get my local sports talk<br />that I listen to at the office.  I found a few different ones in<br />Oklahoma also and as a Sooner Fan its nice if I can't get it<br />on my radio and use my Kindle Fire HD as its so handy when<br />its near me to just open up and listen.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read this books in a few days and it blew me away. The end, though, is kind of disappointing. The author writes with such detail that you hear, feel and experience every word in this amazing literary piece!
B007MGWBU2|4.0|Its a great Muppets movie and doesn't disappointing, just remember it for kids and you'll enjoy it.  Go in thinking its going to be a block buster movie and you'll be disappointed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|the racketeer kept me involved through the whole book ;cover to cover. the characters were well developed and believable. one of Grisham's most developed tales.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|While reading the book I could feel my throat clench, my throat become dry, and my breathing become shallow as I felt the stress of the characters. Almost every character can easily be mapped to someone you've worked with before.<br /><br />I didn't realize I would like this book this much. While reading it, I kept on getting flashbacks to my own career and those early days where I made mistake after mistake. It's what made me understand that generally everyone has the best intentions but that doesn't stop IT failure. Some of the stories around database change management were eerily similar to my experiences. There's also a validating experience in that the efforts I'm going to now align with some of the practices in the book.<br /><br />One thing I wish the book had was an organisational chart. You get to know them soon enough, but I ended up re-reading some parts to regain context on who is who, and what their role is in the conversation.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|This is a great movie about misfits and about how to be number one in the pirating industry.  I always enjoy anything that is like a claymation or animation and this fits the bill.

B005LAII62|5.0|Right in there with Jason, Freddy, and IT is Paranorman but on the animated side.  There are crazy teenagers, zombie-like creatures, and some awesome effects.  I loved ring tone of \\"Halloween\\" on Norman's best friend Neil's cellphone and Neil's his curly hair and his man boobs remark was a hit.  Norman can see and talk to dead people and in my opinion he is better off than yaking to the living.
0812993357|4.0|Outside of fashion, Grace still strikes an impressive figure. Perhaps it's her hair. Grace (2012) is the memoir of Grace Coddington, the British-born former model and current creative director of American Vogue magazine. Thrust recently into the spotlight through the documentary film The September Issue (2011) about the inside workings of the magazine, Grace is easily recognizable.<br /><br />Coddington, \\"The Cod\\", writes of her early years, her loves and lovers, her personal and professional partners, and of course fashion designers, models, celebrities, stylists, photographers, make-up artists, hairdressers, assistants, and bosses. Every aspect of the complex and complicated interconnected web of production to prop to final photograph is mentioned in an easy-to-read style, with a veritable list of who's who in the business.<br /><br />From inspiration to fully fledged photo shoot, Coddington explains how some of the most memorable Vogue features were created, and how fashion publicity has changed over time. Many of the features she describes will be instantly familiar to loyal long-time Vogue readers. As Coddington describes her favorites, from clothes to people, it will either affirm or question readers' own interests and trends, and re-ignite a passion for the retro, the past, and a much-loved piece or move readers along to the current vogue.<br /><br />Of most interest, she accompanies the text with an impressive amount of personal photographs and Vogue fashion spreads (British Vogue to American Vogue), but also with many of her own line drawings.<br /><br />Her memoir is no back-stabbing expose of everyone in the fashion business. Quite the opposite - it is a nostalgic reflection of her experiences and influences over fifty years in the business, and told with candor, humor, and extreme grace.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I love this little book about book writing and publishing.  It is easy to read, consumer-friendly to use, and is worth the read.  I would suggest it to any budding author.  It would be a plus for the published author if they have not had the pleasure of being a Kindle writer.
B001EAWME2|4.0|Before Porky's 1 and 2, before A Christmas Story, director Bob Clark created this introduction to the infamous slasher film called Black Christmas. Even though it may seem somewhat dated by these modern horror/slasher films, it still has some creepy scenes of dread and fear. Olivia Hussy and John Saxon stand out from the remaining cast. The killer is very well played. This film is deservedly cult horror classic status material. To me, the remake isn't bad either-though it has been awhile since I've watched it. This one seems to have a much more ominious feeling of dread and terror though, if you haven't seen it and you're a slasher/horror film fan, you may want to check it out. As for the remake, it's worth a look, but don't expect an exact repeat, that you won't get.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This unique and creative show continues to capture my interest.  And the music score is quite excellent.  The main weakness in the premise is Regina's continued hatred of Snow White.  She must fully realize that Snow was only trying to help her, however the disastrous the results. Accept it and move on. Or is this just a rationalization for her true 'evil' nature?
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I never thought I would be reading this, but it was pritty good. It was funny I will tell you.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I guess it's difficult to eclipse a world war for drama. Still, I am enjoying the new season as it moves along.  The coming conflict between Matthew and Robert on the running of Downton Abbey promises to be good.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I need to get the next one! So many unsuspected surprises. I loved every page of it. Can't wait to see the movie.
B00AB12TEI|5.0|It was really much much better. I loved every single page of the book. I thought it was only about the model but I thoroughly enjoyed the &#34;discovering you&#34; exercises.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A rather twisted romance; but a true romance nonetheless.  I consider it a real page turner.  The sex is a bit graphic, however, there is more to this work than mere sex.  I see two people truly in love with one another with enormous obstacles to overcome.  There are surprises here and you can never be sure how things will turn out.  Truly a great read!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a great novel for romantics. Especially those who love a mushy love fest. I enjoyed the characters and the plot.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I started reading this series in July and its January . These books are written so beautifully with so much emotion. Read these books!!! Im 21 and i haven't read any series that  compares. Thank you George RR Martin!!

B007THA4FI|1.0|There were so many characters that you couldn't follow the story line. They are so intertwined in their releationships that you got easily confused. I only read about 25% of the book and stopped.
0756405890|2.0|I was actually quite surprised by how many people actually like this book that much. I probably underestimated the power of Mary Sue characters. Apparently a lot of people still really like this kind of perfect people doing amazing things in fantasy genre. My major issue with this book is its main character Kvothe and his many adventures.<br /><br />Kvoth is perfect in every possible way, even flaws (his arrogance or naivete) are portrayed in a positive light. He is extremely smart, when I say smart, I don't mean IQ 180 kind of smart, I mean \\"arguably the smartest the person in the world\\" kind of smart. Early on in the book, the author spend entire chapter describing how he learnt the most difficult language in 1 week, and how he deciphered a complicated code in mere hours. He's extremely talented with music at a very very young age, not only he can play songs, he can play emotions, he can play scenery, he can play 7 string lute with 2 string broken, he can play THE most complicated song with 1 string broken and still stun his audience and won the price. He's handsome (that goes without saying, all fantasy people are handsome, unless they're bad guys or unimportant peasants). He is the youngest to be admitted in THE university (seems there's only 1 university in this fantasy world), and he's the youngest to receive a highly regarded credential, and he's the one who achieve that credential in the shortest amount of time. I can go on and on and on about how amazing and absolutely awesome this person is.<br /><br />The book also created bunch of supporting characters, much like the Harry Potter books. All the good guys adores Kvoth, and all the bad guys hate him. You can basically separate good guys and bad guys not by their own deed, but by their attitude towards Kvoth. Everything happened to him happened out of bad luck or malice of bad people. He always thrived triumphantly against devastating disasters. Even when he made mistakes out of his own arrogance, the bookgo extra miles to justify his action, throw in a villain to take the responsibility for Kvoth, and make everything all sympathetic again for him.<br /><br />Halfway through the book, I have nothing but loath and disdain for this character, not because he's a villain, but because he's the most self-important and arrogant little brat I have read, and the book worship this guy like some kind of demigod, giving him all the excuses, removing all his responsibilities, creating all the opportunities for him to be awesome.<br /><br />What's not helping is that I was reading A dance with Dragons at the same time, and the comparison makes the book even more unbearable. On one hand, I have amazing characters like Cercei and Arya with incredible depths and personality; on the other hand I have Kvoth, with his incredibly unbelievable smart and talent, and being love by all the secondary characters through out the book. On one hand, I have the complicated interpersonal relationships between multiple characters with love, hate, lust, manipulation, betrayal all tangled together, you don't know where love stops where betrayal starts; on the other hand, I have the black and white, hate him or love him, 2 dimensional relationship that Kvoth seem to enjoy with the people around him, and the most juvenile puppy love that's probably only a little bit better than Twilight.<br /><br />Character development aside, the book is also annoys me to no end with its endless rambling. I do believe the principle of \\"show not tell\\". The author not only tell too much, he felt the need to justify his narrative every step of the way. For example, Kvoth went through a tragedy early on as a child and he wandered the woods in a numb state for a while. The book have to constantly remind me \\"oh I'm just a little kid, I went through such horrible tragedy and I'm totally numb\\". Yes I know, I just read that chapter 10 minutes ago, I didn't suffer amnesia and forget all about it! Don't tell me you're numb and sad, show me. The book justify Kvoth's every action, every plot twist, as if the author is not confident at the intelligence of his readers and he feel the need to explain it again and again.<br /><br />All in all, the book is a huge disappointment with its tedious narrative and abysmal character development. I absolutely do not want to keep torturing myself with further reading.
0316174483|5.0|I ordered this to have in our craft box at home. We don't have kids living in our house anymore, but lots of them come visiting. This is a very creative thing to pull out. Children can do this without supervision, and I think they begin to see the shapes in things -- something that will spur their creativity! I highly recommend this!

B002MU4NLI|4.0|Purchased as a gift, this item came in a timely fashion.  While I have not personally played the discs, the item arrived in perfect condition and the included bell did make a decent sounding jingle even through the packaging.  The bell is small and looked light, so don't expect a rich chime.  Still a nice looking set overall, and a gift that was happily received.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book that I read! Can't wait to read the other two books!! Hope they're just as good or better.
0061969656|5.0|Another great Cornwell read.  The entire Uthred series of books have been great reading.  If you have not started this series and like Cornwell's other books, I highly recommend trying these books out.  Death of Kings was amazing and keeps the saga going in grand style.  Read this book!
030758836X|1.0|What can I say I wanted my money back,what,was,the,purpose of the,book won't buy any more,of her books if was really bad ending,sucks,
0062124293|5.0|I first heard Caitlin Moran on NPR's Fresh Air. She was so insightful & witty that I had to buy her book. Her book is a hilarious take on pubescence, child-rearing, sex, & pop-culture from a female perspective. And she links together vignettes from her life with poignant insights on feminism. I enjoyed this book so much that I now have 5 copies loaned out to varying family members and friends. Every liberal in my generation -- men & women under age 40 -- has similarly loved reading my copy of How to Be a Woman. However, my mother -- raised conservatively & still a bit shy of the sex topic -- did not quite &#34;get&#34; the humor. I recommend this book to any open-minded reader who believes in the female right to vote, right to work, & right to choose how many children to bear.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Even though it may be used for the past year and I love the past two years ago when I was going through my mind and I was going to have the same thing as the first.  But when I was in a. Trance the same. Kids.
B0095P33IW|5.0|This movie is my favorite of all the Avengers Movies!  I love how they bring History to Life and think the story line is genius:).  I can't wait for the next Captain America Movie!  A Must Watch!
B004U8VX2M|3.0|This original series is excellent for the production and acting. Because most of the earlier versions are black and white, the quality does not show up very well on my HD TV. Of course, additionally, the audio is lacking and that with the British accent lends to not understanding all of the dialogue. I will continue to watch additonal episodes only because the story and characters are quite interesting.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Fun music that our whole family loves! The kids ask for it over and over again. Can't wait till the next album comes out!
B009WJ44KC|5.0|This soundtrack is just as good as the movie. I have listened to it several times already and am amazed, as always with the exceptional music that John Williams writes. Beautifully done.
B003UESJJC|2.0|I bought this just because I'm a fan of Coppola & Brando & I made a mistake, I mean it's a cool collection to have if you like the Movie because it's an awesome case & comes with a collectors book but the movie itself is extremely boring

B0067TQQI8|5.0|Appears to be very well built. Having the ability to plug a usb into the unit instead of being hardwired should prolong product life and durability. My other charger was purchased in an airport.  After about a week in my pocket, the case plit and the built in cord is coming apart. Because of the capacity, his backup is a bit thick, but it carries that extra size well.

1416562605|3.0|Adiga is a gifted writer, his prose struck me as good as Orwell or Naipaul.<br />My complaint is that the story and events rely too much on what I call the pornographic of India - repeating the same old caste, gender injustices, corruption, beatings, random killings,  s****ing in the open,  etc etc that India is already famous for. That westernized readers don't mind watching over and over , satisfying what seems like a primal urge.<br /> If the author is only offering it is a Us Vs them, just kill the landlords solutions - seems more suited for Mao or Marx of ages ago. Not for the '21st century man' that Aravind Adiga wants to describe..<br />  Aravind - the poor of India are slowly steadily getting better lives and it isn't because of less corrupt politicians or landlords but despite these forces ,which are anyway prevalent all over the world, for all of human history.<br />People are getting richer because their free enterprise is unleashed to create goods and services that others buy, so that they don't have to worry about killing plutocrats and others in a zero sum game.<br /> How about writing something about an entrepreneur who invents something new, helps change his part of the world for the better, and his journey story  to get there?<br />- instead of only pointing out yet another example of the System is f**ked, but this boy learned how to Cheat it.

B000W27AE0|5.0|i love it.Bring back thoughts of the 80's and the time in the military. It had more songs on it than the original sound track.
B008QI6EHQ|5.0|This book may well relate to things today. All should read this because our president today is a modern day version of hitler. All of his supporters can bash me all they want for writing this but it's the truth
B0015DROBO|4.0|I thought the mystery plot was intriguing and fresh. I liked the idea of dark family secrets of the rich and famous.....and the Vanger family is full of sinister secrets and characters. The fact that the mystery spread over a significant period of time added a lot to the plot for me. I found myself wondering how much the time had affected the memories of the characters....it created a similar feeling that an unreliable narrator does for the reader.<br /><br />Besides a few minor distractions, I'm intrigued by the series to say the least. It is a fresh, modern thriller that clearly appeals to the masses. It was fast paced once I got into it and past the initial financial set up. Blomkvist and Salander make a good team and I look forward to seeing their relationship develop in the coming books.<br /><br />See my full review here: [...]
B006LSZECO|2.0|The first half of the book was slow.  The second half was more interesting and a fast read.  The ending was very disapointing.

B008ZVXNX2|5.0|I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the books and can appreciate true, classical music. It is exactly what it says it is, a &#34;Classical Album&#34;. With that being said, it is very reflective of the books and the quality of this is excellent. This is one you can put on, shuffle and enjoy for quite some time!

B005DOL0R0|5.0|I like to use the cover as it is easier to carry it if I want to take it with me.
B008KPIN9C|5.0|I haven't heard their older stuff; this was the first album of theirs I have listened to. I have read a few reviews about the \\"gritty\\" sound on this album, but that's probably what I love the most about it! The lyrics are raw, relateable, and just beautiful. There is not a single song on this album that I skip over, though I have my favorites, with \\"Halcyon Days\\", \\"My Love Won't Wait\\",\\"Broken Eyes\\", and \\"Winter's Youth\\". I could swear one of my favorite local (El Paso, TX) artists covers \\"Broken Eyes\\" sometimes in their shows, but I can't remember for sure. Anyways, if you love beautiful lyrics that will haunt you, some rock n' roll, grit, and music that's just plain good... this album is for you. I defy you to not be moved!<br /><br />-DeAnne<br /><br />Also, I have just downloaded one of their older albums. I'm hoping that even though other fans/listeners say it's more \\"polished\\", that I'll find the Two Gallants I fell in love with on this album.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I liked playing this game.  It was fun and at times it was quite a chalgane to play.  Good game.

B004GJYRKA|4.0|I dont like when the bars are covering the movie and I can not see the whole screen, but the movie was awsome.
0375507256|5.0|We loved the movie Cloud Atlas, so I bought the book and two more by the same author.  My husband thought reading this book after seeing the movie was very helpful-it filled in some blanks, and made the overall theme of the book more understandable.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|Was still a good movie though.  Lot of areas where you almost knew what was coming.  Had a lot of good, startling areas!
1451695195|5.0|Great book - the title might be uncomfortable to believers, since their beliefs are rooted in faith, but the book is an easy read and provides some amazing facts about the after-death experiences of a renown neuro-physiologist
1606865617|5.0|This brilliant piece of literature is quite difficult to read. Not because it's badly written, no, it's almost poetic prose. But the suspense and the buildup creates immense pressure on the reader. You know (or imagine) what will happen, it will be horrible, you don't want to see it, but you must turn the page...<br /><br />The use of flashbacks is great and the reader will see the perspective of each and every person involved in this drama. When you finish the book you will have travelled through generations and several lives. The tragic event that completely destroys the family doesn't have a single point of origin; it began long ago with many little \\"tragic\\" events that end in the death of a child(does it? Not at all, it's much more complex than that). The reader knows it almost from page one who dies, and from that knowledge he is in a perfect place to follow the events travelling in time sometimes to the past, others to the future (seeing the results of the tragedy).<br /><br />The authoress manages to become several different persons, seeing the world in different perspectives and morality systems. Baby Kochama never sees herself as a manipulative hag for example; the twins see the world in terrifying or wonder like tones...everything is extreme, Chako sees himself as a communist (although all others see him as an enemy of the party); the local communist leader uses one of theirs to be a martyr and he sees himself as a hero (with just one word he could have stopped one of the tragedies); Ammu finds out to late the terrible power of words said in anger...but she casts all blame to others never acknowledging that her words set in motion the tragedy, seeing herself only as a victim (and she really is a victim, but also an oppressor).<br /><br />Curiously, most (readers, reviewers, characters in the novel) talk about the tragedy of Sophie Mol (the one that we know that dies almost from page one), or the destinies of the twins. But few talk about Velutha, the injustice and horrible fate that await him...he truly is the god of small things, and we must notice that his destiny is almost independent of Sophie's...even if she didn't died, his awful end would be just the same.<br /><br />One of the best books I've ever read. Highly recommended.tice and horrible fate that await him...he truly is the god of small things, and we must notice that his destiny is almost independent of Sophie's...even if she didn't died, his awful end would be just the same.<br /><br />One of the best books I've ever read.

B000OLTMQ8|4.0|Nice wrap up to a great series. I wish boxing could be more like this series. The whole thing is very inspiring
B00AAQ7JNA|3.0|The concert was pretty good. I probably would have given it 4 stars, but like other reviewers stated, the sound is pretty bad. This is especially so for a Blu-Ray release. I would compare it to just a little bit better than personal YouTube concert footage. The picture quality was good as a Blu-Ray, but I wasn't wowed at the HD.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was about two people that were so opposite.<br />It made me wonder about people in that are in Will's similar condition.<br />I encounter people in Will's condition and thought they might have similar thoughts and feelings like him.<br />This was a great book, it made me happy, sad and relieved. I had finished reading it while at the gym and I couldn't help but cry.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing game, I'm addicted! Can't put the tablet down, and even at school I want to play so so so bad!
0689835604|5.0|I bought this for my little grandson. He loves looking at the colors in the pictures and turning the pages.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is the best thing ever !!!! I love it  and can't put it down! Definitely worth down loading! You won't be sorry

B003I55BIA|5.0|This is nit the first time I have read this book. This may have been my fifth time :) Simone Alleles is an amazing author! The next two books of this trilogy are just as good as the first one.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|I find that I try again and again to beat my last score.  The familiar songs make it easy for even a non-musician to participate in the fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this book five stars because like the first one it kept me going the whole way through the book. Gale, Peeta and Katniss r the perfect triangle of drama and true friendship. Can't wait to start book three!
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My toddler loves to help the animals and to shoot the trash into the garbage cans.  This game has a lot of purposeful actions and I like the shorts throughout that help to maintain my little guy's short attention span.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I have been able to tie almost all the knots. Pictires and the way it is told how to tie really helps.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|This movie is pure fun....great story, music, characters.  It is a classic, a sure winner.  Done is a time when families could watch the screen together without fear of warping anyone.
B004I744AS|3.0|Needs a &quot;clear&quot; function for the search field to make it quicker for multiple look ups.<br />Otherwise it is fine for definitions and such.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|People who survived the &#34;camps&#34; have always fascinated me. Such a victory of human will!<br />I bought this as a Kindle and then purchased a &#34;paper&#34; copy so that my (adult) children could read  it.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|Is what I thought as soon as I saw \\"Lucasfilm\\" at the very beginning.<br /><br />Sure enough, there were beautiful recreated dogfights.  And there were shallow characters, a lot of dogfights (who needs character development?), enemies that were incompetent, and a lot of cheesy dialogue between pilots just like you'd expect in a Star Wars movie.<br /><br />I \\"bailed\\" after about 40 minutes.  What a waste of time.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I just downloaded temple run 2 today and i loved it and it was the only thing i did for an hour straight. suddenly then app gets stuck on the loading screen and crashes. this happens repeaditly. it is awful cause i spend $15 on upgrades and stuff in the store and now i cant even play it.... biggest dissapointment ever
B000ZM1FXO|3.0|For all the ballyhoo surrounding this film; its making, its cutting and re-cutting, its problems over release, CALIGULA is in fact less than the sum of its parts. Its hard-core porn, violence, and scenes of excess are mild compared to Pasolini's LAST DAYS OF SODOM or Fellini (directors Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione clearly quote from both directors), while the performances are varied, to say the least. O'Toole shouts his lines as if perpetually drunk, while Mirren's so-called 'erotic' dance in front of Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) lacks passion, to say the least. She doesn't even cut as sexy a presence as Amanda Barrie's Cleopatra in CARRY ON CLEO (1965).  On the other hand, the film does have a certain fascination, if only for its ingenious of lighting, music and dance; this is a fantasy-world of unbridled lust and passion where absolutely anything goes. Gore Vidal's screenplay contains some cliches, but is at least historically accurate.  Worth at least one look.
B00B59H6EI|2.0|I hope this is the last season. I loved Supernatural when it was borderline scary. The old scripts were pretty good and aside from a few episodes (ghostchasers) they were clever. Now, however, there are more stupid episodes than good ones. Dean and Sam seem to be just coasting through the episodes. The loss of Bobby and his subsequent replacement with \\"Garth\\" (oh God why...if there were ever a annoying character it is him) was a stupid move. Goodbye Supernatural, may you rest in peace instead of continuing on as a shambling mockery of what you once were.
B007KAJG3K|4.0|Very good story plot not alot of action like the first movie but it was awsome. It would be a good movie in 3D
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|As good as the first one, but the first one was a little bit better.  Although entertaining, it just seemed rushed.  For the technology we have today, this should of been a mind blowing movie and not pop rocks! The gun needed to repeat the judge's firing commands like it did in the first one.  DOUBLE WHAMMY! I did like the realism of the movie, made me wonder...are that for off of that being our future?
B00AREIAI8|4.0|the game is entertaining and I don't even realize how much time has passed until I look at the time.  it's a great game for horse lovers and kids.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it. Entertaining. I feel like I have my very own horse. It's fun to play and helps pass the time.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|cool features love the horses this game is better than the other free horse games I have seen so far so thank you for it
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing of all the praises about this book for the last year, I finally decided to give it a go -- and after reading about 1/3 of the book, I became so disgusted that I simply skimmed through the rest of this \\"story\\" to see how it turned out. To be honest, I don't even remember how it ended, and I just finished it last night!<br /><br />These are probably the most unlikeable characters ever written about -- if you can even think of them as characters. They have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, nor do they have anything to really hate about them. They're simply \\"there.\\"<br /><br />They're nothing but plot devices (of course, there is no plot, so I'm not sure that's even an accurate word to use) to get us to the sex -- and there is a LOT of sex. Pages, upon pages of sex. It never ends. It just goes on, and on, and on. After the third of fourth sex scene it becomes repetitive and boring rather than erotic or interesting.<br /><br />In fact, perhaps disturbing is a more accurate word. The moral and social implications involved are obvious and sad. And I don't mean the sex. Sex is fine. Even graphic sex. But sex should be well written and serve a purpose (see George R.R. Martin). Or if epic fantasy is not your thing, try the MILLIONS  Romance novels, at least.) This is something else. The big problem I had is how Ana seems fine with being ABUSED throughout the entire book (again, it's not a story). This is not a love story, or a story about sex. It is a collection of abusive scenes in which a freak of a guy (who doesn't \\"make love\\" but only f-words women) continually corrupts and destroys the mental well being of a young woman.<br /><br />In the TV version of A Game of Thrones, Dany is basically raped on her first night with Kahl Drogo (not so in the book). It is a well executed and DISTURBING scene. And she HATES it. As the season progresses she evolves (as does Drogo) and they grow to love each other, and both change and grow etc. It's actually a pretty good love story. Well, Fifty Shades of Grey is basically that first sex scene (abusive and controlling) over, and over again -- but in this case Ana LOVES it. I'm sorry, but what the hell does that say about the character?<br /><br />What's even more disturbing is that the book is so damn popular! Is this really a woman's dream man? A man who will order her around, control her life, and **** her without any real emotional involvement on his part? You've got to be kidding me. At least Drogo grew to LOVE Dany and vice versa -- but Ana and Christian never change at all.<br /><br />Look, I get that this is fiction. It isn't real. And I get the Romance is a booming genre. Hell, I like boy/meets girl stories too. But this is -- well, again, not a story per se. It is an excuse to write about BDSM -- and not anything more. Hell, as far as I know, there are good stories about this subject out there. But I can't imagine that this is one of them.<br /><br />The fact that this thing hit the New York Times bestseller list is evidence of something -- I'm just not sure what it is evidence for.<br /><br />Again, if you want to read  sex -- that's great. If you want to read  graphic sex, that's fine too. But why can't people read the well written stuff, instead of this?<br /><br />Of course, I may just not get any of this. Maybe I'm a prude (okay, since I read, and like, George Martin and Terry Goodkind, that's probably not the case). Maybe this is just not my cup of tea. Maybe the book really has some redeeming qualities that I'm just not seeing. Maybe one has to be female to see them. But basically, all I see is -- well, something not worth my time. Thank God I read this as a library book and didn't pay for it.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I'm 13 and I had fun reading it. I'm definitely going to read the next book. You should get it too.

Anybody spent some time in gym can easily figure out how valuable this book is.<br /><br />On and off, I went to gym for over two years and never accomplished anything solid. Had I known what I<br />learned in this book, back in the days, I would never stay away from bodybuilding. Even if you are not<br />intending to go to a fitness center, you can find the information you need to create your meal plans that<br />will lead you to reach your weight goals.<br /><br />You can do something or you can do something with passion. With this book you will be highly concentrated<br />as I am right now!

B009UWYFFK|4.0|HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA, last fall's box-office hit from animator/director Genndy Tartakovsky and producer Adam Sandler, proves to be surprising fun. While animated at younger viewers, there's plenty of old-fashioned Movie Monster mayhem here to please fans of the Universal era with Count Dracula (voiced by Sandler) about to celebrate his daughter's 118th birthday by staging a massive party at his Transylvanian hotel, one devoted exclusively to Drac's monster pals. Crashing their undead-only event comes a young American backpacker (voiced by Andy Samberg) who develops an immediate attraction to the birthday girl, but Dracula quickly douses the happy-go-lucky kid in Frankenstein make-up so his human identity won't be revealed to the insular monster community.<br /><br />Peter Baynham and comedian Robert Smigel are credited with the script for \\"Hotel Transylvania,\\" which - although saddled with a conventional and predictable story line - makes for good fun thanks to amusing humor and Tartakovsky's engaging animation, here rendered in 3-D CGI form. The filmmakers put a modern, comedic spin on the great monsters of the Golden Age (envisioning the Wolfman as a harried family man, for example) and punctuate the material with snappy visual gags and atmosphere that recalls a good Looney Tunes or Tex Avery cartoon spoofing the Karloff age. Naturally, kids will be the most receptive to \\"Hotel Transylvania\\"'s charms, but that's of course the point: between the good-natured comedy and colorful design, it's no surprise younger viewers preferred this over Tim Burton's well-meaning but decidedly more downbeat \\"Frankenweenie\\" in theaters last fall.<br /><br />Sony brings \\"Hotel Transylvania\\" to Blu-Ray this week in the form of a multi-disc 3D/2D presentation with corresponding DVD and Ultraviolet copies. Though produced to utilize 3D from the outset, there's little lost in the 2D Blu-Ray presentation since there are few pop-out effects. Both 1080p (1.85) transfers look great but colors,of course, are more satisfying in the 2D rendition. The DTS MA audio is nicely mixed, offering a better than expected score by Mark Mothersbaugh, while extras include a four-minute 2D animated short \\"Goodnight Mr. Foot\\" (animated in Tartakovsky's usual style), a commentary by the filmmakers, six minutes of deleted scenes, music videos, DVD-ROM content and format-exclusive progression reels and supporting featurettes.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Typical Lee Child, detailed, accurate and suspenseful. If you have read any of this series you can pick this one up and fall right back in. Just a good read.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|I've never read anything of his that I didn't like a lot.  Not only is he humorous, but he is very insightful to the subtle absurdities that we all experience.  He will tell his private thoughts and feelings, which make me feel great as I have similar situations and find humor in the same.<br /><br />Not every story is funny, but it doesn't matter because all are interesting.  I'm feeling a bit sad as I am on the last chapter in my Kindle book, but am grateful that I have another ready to take it's place.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|This is a great read. Full of emotion and young love and loss.It is quite short so perfect for a short holiday or long plane journey.

B0012QTT4O|1.0|I was really confused when I bought this (video on demand) and realized that swear words were being omitted and there was a blur out of some frontal nudity. It does not affect the show quality at all, but I feel that if I am paying for the show I should see the whole original show! There was no label or warning that I saw to indicate that this was censored.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Everyone was spouting off that this movie was not as good as the original but honestly it is way better, This Dredd has much more of a plot than the original (in the sense that at points you actually care) and an actor who doesn't look like his face is falling off. Now lets not get off track, this is an action movie for the sake of being an action movie, if you are expecting a in depth plot of suspense and intrigue you will find it lacking. It is a fun movie with explosions, gunfire, and sparkly slow motion action shots, worth seeing at least once.
1449410243|5.0|After slogging through some fairly heavy material with the last book I read, it's always a treat to read something light and amusing. As a cat person, this book was the perfect choice. Not many humorous books have me laughing out loud, but this one did. If you own cats you'll get the humor. If you don't, it'll only confirm your belief that cats and owners have a really weird relationship.<br /><br />Author Matthew Inman truly knows his topic and his drawings are as funny as the text. There are so many great cartoons to accompany the captions that it doesn't take long to read the 130 pages. Despite the easy read and full-color pages, this isn't a book for children. The humor is definitely adult and some parents might not approve of the language, or the cynical, cagey attitude of the chapters featuring the Bobcats (two cats who work in an office and endlessly annoy their human colleagues). For humor, creativity, and a great title, I give the book two thumbs up.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|It is an end to the trilogy, Bain is cool but it seems like the whole movie should have been spread out into two parts. I found if lacking but  enjoyable. it is still a fun movie and worth the 3.99 to rent but i wouldn't buy it until a box set comes out with all three movies together in some sort of special edition,
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldnt put it down I laughed cried and rooted for them. Through me for a loop but loved every minute. Would definetly recommend love her books
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was amazing I love it.....makes love seem so real and the way they met was so cute :)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Hated to see the book end!!! I found this book to be an excellent read. The story was straight forward and gives you an insight as to what our nations best have to go through for us.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|What a surprise ending. Another super book by Baldacci!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the book.
1476715904|5.0|This story took me on an emotional roller coaster ride and I loved it! It gripped my heartstrings from start to finish.<br />A realistic novel that deals with love, loss, life, death and other challenges that young adults face.<br />Not being a fan of poetry, slam poetry touched me in a way I didn't think possible.<br />I quickly became attached to each and every character and can hardly wait to read \\"Point Of Retreat\\" the 2nd book in the Slammed series, to see where the author takes them.<br />Colleen Hoover is a genuinely gifted author!
B000VDDWDS|4.0|The movie and acting is fantastic.  the extras are a little limited and I wish it was an extended version.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is very fun to play, it's fun to build your very own city with factories and all, but you should have more money to start off with, or you should be able to excel faster
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This casing is really nice and fits great on the kindle fire. Protect it from sun and other harmful substances. It arrived on time and worth every penny!!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This book peaked my interest as I really like JFK as a kid and wanted to get another perspective on that point in our history.  Well it did way more than that!  SK has crafted an incredible tale of time travel and how history could be altered in the process.  This has everythiung including a great love story besides.  I found it more entertaining than some of his recent books since he finished the Dark Tower series.  A must read and very hard to put down!
0470477237|2.0|Well written, but boring & no page turner.Important content worth knowing, but I couldn't stay awake. Very dissapointed it didn't hold my interest.
0062103377|4.0|This one was not exactly what I expected, but I enjoyed it. David Reed has presented an original case for Supernatural fans in the voice of one of the shows most beloved characters Bobby Singer. In an attempt to salvage missing time and what appears to be memory loss Bobby begins writing down his memories both from the past and present. His need to do this is fueled by his love for the Winchester brothers and an attempt to pass on his knowledge of hunting in case he doesn't survive. Have you ever wondered where Bobby learned Japanese? How did he meet Rufus? What really happened the night he killed his demon possessed wife? These are just a few memories Bobby shares as he struggles to survive and not leave his boys behind. Both hilarious and heartbreaking at times I finished this in one setting because I couldn't put it down.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a good app for anyone who liked the first temple run. It is so worth the download. It has all the same details as #1. And it has much more added to the first game. It has a diff lay out and it takes a while to get used to
B008CIUS72|1.0|We were trying to run a program that needed a flash player and this flash player wouldn't run the program.  Shoot.
B008G33PMI|3.0|Nightwish is a very good band. Tarja made them great. I was disappointed with the break-up but have followed her solo career. The first two c.d.'s get regular rotation in the home/car players. Was looking forward to this live compilation. By looking at the 3 Star rating, you would be right in saying that I am less than thrilled. The sound mix on these discs is beyond awful. On far too many tracks, Tarja's voice is completely drowned out by the drums. There is no balance. The other musicians make an occasional appearance but not nearly often enough. I'm guessing that many who have bought this also own \\"End of an Era\\". That too was recorded live but unfortunately, that's where the similarities end. On End, Tarja's voice and the instruments complimented and enhanced each other. Here.......nada.<br /> There is a fine line with this particular genre. Symphonic metal is a style that has become well defined by groups playing it (Epica, Within Temptation, etc.)I feel that Tarja completely missed with the effort here. She is too opera-y. I love her voice but don't want to hear The Voice of Spring. Straight up, the lady just isn't rockin'. She is without a doubt, one of my favorite vocalists. It will be interesting to see if there is a noticeable change in her style/delivery.
0545265355|5.0|If a best-seller that becomes a movie takes an out-of-this-world story, Ms. Collins certainly came up with the recipe.  The first installment of the trilogy is fascinating and made me want to find out if the cruel ruling elite of Katniss Everdeen's world could possibly be defeated by the seemingly helpless underclass.  The next two volumes do not disappoint.
B000KZ3BWE|5.0|Movie shows great data that Gore has spent years collecting.  Students eyes were opened to the threat of climate change.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have this on my kindle fire hd. This works very well. I will say the sign in process is a bit much, but once you get it completed the app works great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|free flow is not just another ordinary puzzle...it challenges you to think outside the box. Great way to pass the time and heighten visual acuity
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I am well pleased with battery hd  due to the time it saves me on my kinddle fire.  Due to this program I can keep up with my battery time used and the time that is left.  Thank for battery hd
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it so many great ideas! Really like the pictures. I love repinning and seeing others repins. A lot of fun.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|Need more levels to complete.  I have played this one also over and over again.  Need more variety.  Please provide more and longer lasting mahjong games
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Very impressed with this app it has more sounds than you could ask for.  Some of the options leave me a little confused as to why they were included, but you can't fault them for lack of choice.  Another great thing is the amount volume on my book its much louder than Netflix is which makes me wonder why all appear can't crank the sound like this one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Enjoy all the angry bird games except Tiny Bird.  Keep coming up with new editions so I won't get bored
B0013D6LEM|5.0|So many memories of this album when it came out. This is a classic must own for any collection no matter what your favorite genre of music may be.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Wish there were more levels.  I have reached all of them and have no where to use all my coins.
B007BFSYMS|2.0|Really like the concept. The sound loops should be longer and loop with variations. The alarm clock function is great -sound quality snd variation needed. Thsnk you.
159514188X|1.0|if it were possible to give it 0 stars i would. Way to slow moving not well written it just continues to drag on and on and on. Dont understand how everyone loves it so much do you self a favor save yourself the time save yourself the money don't buy it and Do Not Read It. Jay Asher did not hit the mark. No matter what others think this is my opinion
B009PF93LS|5.0|This is quite the CD.  I have just discovered Michael, and he sounds wonderful.  His background music on this<br />CD is wonderful.....full orchestral sound.....beautiful.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|When I started this movie I wasn't sure what I was getting into because of all the mediocre/bad reviews. People seemed to have huge problems with it. It turned about to be the best movie I've watched all year. The reviews complained about the differences it had from the original and that Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Beil looked too similar. The movie may not be the same as the original, but it was still a very good movie and I don't know how people couldn't tell the difference between Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Beil. Overall I recommend this movie even if you liked the first one (just think of them as different movies).
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are great and the mechanics are smooth. My kids love having the horses run up to them for petting and treats. The minigames are great too, challenging enough to keep my children interested but not so challenging that they get frustrated.  My only gripe is that my kids want the pretty unicorn (of course) but their price is way beyond reasonable. Hence 4 stars instead of five.  I'd rather have the game itself cost a few dollars but its contents be free/included.  A minor inconvenience also is the fact that the game requires internet access to play, so taking this game on the road is impossible. Still, the part that is free is very nicely done, so I am incapable of giving this app anything less than 4 stars.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I mean, how could anyone dislike this? Even if you are unimpressed by the mind-blowing photography and never-seen-before footage, there is no way you can ignore the effort that went into the production. Most of the time-lapse shots are mesmerizing. It made me re-evaluate my position on conserving natural resources and wildlife to say the least.<br /><br />If nothing, it is completely worth watching just for the segment on Caves (the Lechuguilla), the vampire squid from hell, and also for the spectacular and admittedly a tad scary underwater scene in the Yucatan cenotes. I was positively moved by the footage of the Panda bear and its cub trying to survive in the wild.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love the g5 games. They are fun and entertaining not too easy not too hard. Please g5 release more games for the kindle fire.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Typical Clancy book.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.  Looking forward to more books in the future.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|As a kid when it was required reading, I resisted. But as an adult I've enjoyed it thoroughly. A must for any book collection.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I ordered this book months ago and I thought that I was going to zoom right through it, NOT THE CASE!! This book is a drag or perhaps I just haven't given enough of a shot. I can't believe the writer finally got the story going and then it just stops!!??!? This was the biggest waste of time reading this book. I am so annoyed right now. I will not read another of this writer's books because I won't waste another moment of my life for nothing to happen in the end.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I discovered this book when I was about 12. 30+ years later it's still an old friend I like to visit now and then.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Rothfuss created an amazing world.  I enjoyed this book so much! I love his female characters who are not one dimensional as so often happens.  I can't wait for the next one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is a great book, I enjoyed it very much.  Looking forward to read the other books and seeing the movies.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Misleading. It works only on skype. Wrong advertising.Difficult to use as a camera.I guess, I did not read the fine prints.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|If you are a fan (or potential fan)of Enterprise this set is the way to go. Watch it as fast or as slow as you like.<br />Enterprise is currently on Netflix, but as my dad doesn't have it I got this set for him. Also, It might not be on Netflix forever.<br />The quality is decent, but since this is regular dvd and not Bluray it is as expected. I have no complaints.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I found it dull, time consuming and tedious. It wasn't very fun. Nice graphics though, which gets it an extra star. People are so starved for horse games they are willing to provide a good rating just for producing one.  What I want in a horse game is a quick, empire building type game. Like Howrse.com, they have it down. I hated the camera option. Needing so much gear is kinda dumb. The horse breed options were not good. They keep calling horses brown, or light brown, which proves this was not programmed by horse people. They would call it liver chestnut, or dun. The unicorn looks were stupid, and they certainly wanted a lot of money. Looks like a money trap kind of game that's gonna get a lot or little girls in trouble. Don't bother with this game. I deleted after 20 minutes of boredom. Thankfully I have a real horse to play with.
B001F12J48|1.0|I already owned the movie and wanted the 3D version. Sadly, this is not true 3D. Pass on this one,
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is amazing.Great graphics,etc.I w.<br />ould PAY for this game it is so much better than the first one and the first one was great. I've died several times because I was distracted by the \\"scenery\\".I especially like that you can change the avatar (with enough points)I get tired of male heroes being the only option.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I love this movie as well as the introduction of new characters throughout it. The downside to Wolverine and First Class is certain things don't match up. What I mean by that is the ending of both or portrayed differently with Professor Xavier so it is hard to factor what happened first and why it doesn't make sense.<br /><br />This movie explains how Wolverine got his adamantium claws and his relationship with 'Sabretooth'. All actors in the movie did a fantastic job doing their part. If you are a big fan of Marvel, you need to add this to the collection as well as the other installments.
B0076DEJMO|3.0|I love this author. A great read but not the same as first law or cold or heroes. You will be pleased with the plot but frustrated with the pace. Cheers
B00270CS6K|4.0|Just more music to add to my classic rock playlist.  I could do without the long movie sound clips though, some of them are pretty lengthy, but its not a huge deal, I just removed those items from my playlist when I play the disc.  Sound quality is fantastic.  And of course the most important part, DRM free! :)
B009AMALLM|1.0|I'm a big fan of the paranormal activity franchise. I own all the movies and posters and asisited to all it's premiers (including this one's in Los Angeles) but after watching this film, I'd started to fear that this may become a saw ripp-off. Which could be good thing if the films that follow aren't like this.<br /><br />The film is a sequel to the 2nd film and is set up in 2011. It follows a teen named Alex who starts to feel that something has invaded their house since the arrival of her new neighboors. This neighbors (no surprise) are Katie and a weird kid named Robbie.<br /><br />This film felt like if the crew of this film just wanted to steal your money from you, it has no scares, you don't get to care for the characters (except for the boyfriend) and it doesn't even try to integrate something new for the franchise. The acting also was meh, the only good actors were the the boyfriend and the kids.<br /><br />But I had fun watching this on a cinema with a lot of people that were freaked out by this movie, therefore it gets 1 star. So, I hpe PA5 learns from this film's mistakes. Still I will buy this just to complete my PA collection.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|The actor line up here is amazing no one can argue with that.  Its your typical man film, explosions, fights etc.  Honestly its the best action film I recon you can watch.  But, me personally, I'm just a bit sick of these story-less action films.  This film knows what it is though, and certain people showing up randomly at key times to &#34;save the day&#34; with zero explanation is not even attempted to be hidden here.  If you like things blowing up, a mindless action flick, and have a great sound system then go for it, you wont be dissapointed.  Just dont go looking for a fantastic story that you will remember a week later.
B00003CXB2|2.0|There is a glitch in the disc itself- chapter 28 cuts off. I have played the movie in another player and it did the same thing.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|I was expecting more than toilet humor.  I'm not a fan of these types of films, but I thought I was going to get a bit more laughs in this one than other films like hot tub time machine or the hang over, which I very much disliked.<br /><br />Other people like this type of genre but its just not for me, and unfortunately the film ended up being mostly potty humor.  I ended up fast forwarding a good chunk of this, probably 60% or more after it became evident I just wasnt going to find laughs here.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is another great book by Nicholas Sparks.  I didn't want to put it down.  It is full of suspense and romance.
B002GNNNP8|3.0|TV show:  4 out of 5 (first two seasons are kinda slow, 5 out of 5 for the last 8 seasons)<br />audio video quality:  5 out of 5<br />price:  1 out of 5 (more on that later)<br /><br />I went into this purchase knowing that I was going to pay more than buying the disks new or the disks old.  But, I like my content digital now a days.  I like to have it everywhere I go and I dont like disks taking up space in my home.  You pay a price premium for that, but quite honestly, its just too high.  It will be a great time when digital purchase prices go down for this stuff.  Like movie rentals through amazon, which are priced fine in my opinion.<br /><br />But consider this, unlike disks, you cant re sell this.  I ended up paying less than $10 a season from a local buyer who I found on a certain popular website that specializes in local purchases and selling.<br /><br />I was going to burn the disks, that was the plan after purchase, but, I got lazy.  Its a lot of time to burn disks, which is why I was willing to pay the premium of this digital purchase.  But at almost 10x the price per season that I was paying over the disks, meh, just not worth it I guess.  More clutter in the house, I'll reserve the space for it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a heartwarming, tender story.  It is a must read, especially for dog lovers and race car fans.  My dogs would love this book too!
B009HELT3C|5.0|Im a sucker for sci fi, and this film was great.  I could see the ending coming from about half way through the film, wasnt surprised there but they still ended it nicely.  My only gripe I suppose was that it was missing a bit of comedy that made the original such a pleasure, comedy involving the aliens anyways.  Other than that I thought it was a fantastic film.
034580404X|4.0|I am still on my way reading the trilogy though I find it useful to learn english as this is not my native language.
B003O86FMW|4.0|An entertaining second installment of a very good series<br />It was fun to read 6 more words for dumb review. good.
0547884591|5.0|4 Hour Savant<br />4 Hour Cook<br />4 Hour Redneck<br />4 Hour &#34;Will it Blend&#34;<br />4 Hour Chef<br />These are the parts involved, more or less, you are not a chef by the first section.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Ever since my friends got this app on their apple devices I have been dying to get it. the graphics are so much better and everything looks so awesome. I would still keep the old temple run... but this one is way better.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Ummm. Excuse me while I read this book over and over and over again for the rest of my life. I seriously read every single breathtaking page of Hopeless in 8 hours. ( I know that's slow but don't judge. I'm sicker than a dog.) I'm pretty sure I'm going to be spending the rest of my days searching for Dean Holder. I mean sweet baby Jesus! There are not words to describe what this book will do to you. I cried when I read THE END in big letters, but then again I become so emotionally attached to fictional book characters that it's probably unhealthy. I'm head over heels in love and attached to Sky & Holder. I pray with all that is in me that Colleen well write a sequel. <333
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is definately worth your time.  It is a page turner! You will not be disappointed! READ THIS!!! I couldn't put it down.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I love her books so much.they pull me right in and don't let me go until the very last page. She rocks the pages.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love me a sexy man!!!!!! This is definately worth your time.  It is a page turner! You will not be disappointed! READ THIS!!! I couldn't put it down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hey i know the price is pretty high but it is an awsome game its addictive and its worth the $ so come on get the app
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love me a sexy man!!!!!! This is definately worth your time.  It is a page turner! You will not be disappointed! READ THIS!!! I couldn't put it down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was originally under the impression that this was a book written strictly for teenagers.  I read it in 12 hours.  This kept my complete attention from start to finish. A solid story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love me a sexy man!!!!!! This is definately worth your time.  It is a page turner! You will not be disappointed! READ THIS!!! I couldn't put it down.
B000005AYL|2.0|I should have read the reviews before purchasing, as I too was disappointed to receive the LP in a plain black jacket with a sticker listing the tracks only. No cover art. Why would the label do this? Anyway, Amazon needs to correct the image on this listing to stop misleading its customers. Fortunately, I purchased this LP on sale here for a little over six bucks so it's worth keeping.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is wonderful. But I am not sure if find a difference between the blue ray and regular DVD. The DVD came quickly after ordering.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Downton Abbey both seasons in one set.  The bluray looks awesome.  Watch for deals around the holidays as this is when we purchased.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like this app because you can download more puzzles than the basic ones.  You can choose how many pieces you want the puzzle to be broken into. Great app!
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|Great new album, am enjoying getting acquainted with. Way to go Greg and the boys. You will not be disappointed if you are a bad religion fan. Favorite so far is Dept. Of False Hope
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love using this app when I attend a meeting or church service.  It is a great tool for taking notes!<br />Highly recommended!!
B007REV4YI|2.0|It's 2013.  Do we not have the scientific technology to bring back clones of Terrence Young, Guy Hamilton and John Barry?  \\"Bond.  James Bond\\" is more dead than ever.  No wit.  No charm.  No class.  No Bond.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|this is an awesome book. READ IT.it took obout a month for me to read it but worth it<br /><br />10 AND UP
B00846REIS|4.0|I wanted to give 5 stars, but, there's just a little too much standing between Eva and Gideon for them to seem truly able to find happiness. They are just too troubled.  I enjoyed the story and the sex is hot, but mostly they seemed more sad than happy. I am going t o read the second book because I really want to see how they work it out. I certainly would recommend it.
B00355L2TU|3.0|I saw lots of great reviews and wanted to try it.  Thought it would be more upbeat workout.  All episodes are kind of boring to me.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|great saga; realistic historical interpretation=can't wait for next season to be released to see what it brings to the kingslands
B009A882D0|5.0|WOW, WOW, WOW! I am so happy to have bought this music. It is so energetic, so magic. It makes you dance in your seat of your car. Most of the people in my small town are now thinking I have either gone hippie or gone over the edge. Happy says it all.
B007SSDS24|4.0|I ordered this movie having zero expectations and it really surprised me. Good story, CGI, acting. as always leave your brain on neutral when watching sci-fi movies and you will have a blast. I hope there is a part two.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this app! Whenever I turn on my Kindle, this is what I play! My friend has it, she's the one who told me about it. So glad she did!!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This movie is so far fetched but at the same time it was fun to watch. At time where our country is torn between left and right, its refreshing to see a badass POTUS kick some Vampire ass!!!. Good CGI, OK story, Not bad acting job all around.  What else do you want from a movie titled Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Killer?
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I only gave this app 4 stars because it doesn't always work like it should.  Sometimes it doesn't bring up new posts.  It will show that you have 10 new stories and then bring up posts from 5 days ago and you can't access anything new.  Another MAJOR drawback is when you tap to view a friend's picture and then push the back arrow to return to your news feed .... you have to tap the back arrow repeatedly to get back to your main news feed.  I find that part pretty aggravating.  Other than that, I can do pretty much anything else I want to do on FB.  Navigating to posts, pictures and friends pages is pretty easy besides getting back out of pic's.
0765325950|1.0|Unfortunate that Harriet insisted on delaying the release of the book in electronic form. I'm glad to be done with this series, though.  Overall..meh.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|THOR is a great action movie, full of conflict and resolution.  The plot is well written and the movie, though a fantasy, is fun to watch.  It made me hope for a sequel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Another one of those highly addictive and time consuming games. I play this on my Droid RAZR for hours. Game is cool and prizes are typically easy to unlock.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|I rented this movie because I really liked the idea of seeing all the stars together in a great movie.  I was greatly disappointed.  These stars deserved a better plot but they were placed directly in a &#34;B&#34; movie with a director who did not know how to elicit great acting and poorly written lines.  I really hated to see them this way, knowing that they had played in &#34;A+&#34; rated movies with directors and well-written lines and plots.  Such a waste of good talent!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works well on the Kindle Fire 2. Nice, easy to use app and it's free. Thank you much.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|UP is a must-have chick movie that will warm your heart and touch your soul.  If you don't cry, I would be surprised.  It is that good.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I got lost in the untraditional love story that in my opinion every woman wants. Look forward to more reading.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great read.  You get so attached to the characters that you have to keep reading to see what happens.  The ending is ok (in the fact that you want more).  I have not sat down to read in almost 30 years.  I read all three books in less than a weeks time - couldn't stop reading.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I do not mean a manual. Some of us are used to having a line show how the ball will bounce off walls. It is needed for those higher spots - especially since my finger covers where it &#34;might&#34; bounce off of. Could be better.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a sad but brilliant insight into where our world is headed towards.... Worldwide government. Totalitarian rule of the people, who are treated like sheep to remind them that the world would be chaotic without their benevolent government's rule.<br />Katness is an ordinary young woman dragged into a worldwide conflict; there are a lot less people in her time due to previous conflicts that devastated the Earth. So Earth's remaining population is managed like sheep. All she wants to do is live her life, and enjoy her life in her beloved woods district. But that is not to be; war is hell and she finds this out to her horror. Don't worry there is &#34;sort of a happy ending&#34;.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|We love this case. I read various reviews about it and was very surprised at what I got. There is nothing I would change or dislike about it. The leather is very good quality. The hand strap works great when you need to hold it in you lap, and all you have to do is swing the elastic band around it to hold it open. That was one of the complaints I saw...  It IS stiff when you try to turn it upright and back, but I think it needs to be so it doesn't turn when you don't want it to. And I was worried that it wouldn't have anywhere for my stylus pen to go, but when the cover is closed you can slip in in the binder area. :) We are very happy customers!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|It works find on my tablet, but I use the app on my smart phone more often, as it's more often available to me than my tablet is.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love having this on the kindle. You never know when you are going to need to look up something and having it at my fingertips is great
B0094K1WZE|5.0|It has everything.  Tom Cruise is great.  Like a fun roller coaster ride, It will keep you on the edge of your seat!!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I have tried many white noise apps, but the noticeable loops drive me nuts on most of them. The few sounds I have tried so far loop (of course) but the only one that gets on my nerves so far is the Amazon noise.<br />I have an over active brain, and need something soothing to shut it off enough to sleep...if I can pick out the loop, the app is then useless. BUT, a few sound options on this app are perfect for me, I am very pleased.<br />Deducted one star due to not being able to mix sounds! One of my fave features on other apps. However, reading some of this apps blog comments people mentioned mixing sounds, which left me confused.<br />(On the apps blog you can download additional sounds)
B0090X4GLW|3.0|Has all the main songs from the movie, like listening to it every now and again. Like the Pitch perfect versions. Too bad it doesn't have all the re-mixed versions.
B004JRVQX0|3.0|I hate that there are no other options for ilok, the top of this key will defiantely get lost as there is no where to store it while in use.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|All good things eventually come to an end.<br />Another enjoyable read consumed in a couple of days.<br />I found a great deal of empathy for Katniss, she has been made a complete person with the best and worst of the human race in her.  I would like to be able to meet her!<br />I found this one a bit more adult with more twists and turns to keep the reader guessing.  If it was a meal I would not need dessert.<br /><br />Don, the old guy.

B00979CS50|4.0|Overall a great album. Somewhat disappointed in the studio version of Walk Like a Giant compared with the live Red Rocks version, which I liked better. Driftin Back is too long but a great song. My favorite song off the 2-CD set is Ramada Inn.

B008RTE09S|5.0|I hadn't purchased this movie previously, mainly due to the lack of quality available on the dub. Now that it has been restored and put on the market, I bought my copy ASAP.<br /><br />  I'm sure this is a must-buy only for hard-core Beatles fans, I wouldn't have watched it a second time if not for the Fab Four being the stars... if you count yourself as a Beatles fan then I expect you'll want a copy as well. Great music, and that's what The Beatles were all about.

1442344989|4.0|This was just horrible.  The ordeal, the situation, the story.  I couldn't listen to it after the first 3 cds.  I tried to keep going but it just gets nasty and something I can't imagine listening to again.  Also since she's actually reading....it's not bad but it's not great.  She describes things a child would....since she hasn't had much development....I can see why but it was worth purchasing...Well from what I heard.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great series.  But not so sure about Amazon's service... the shows kept pausing in the middle and saying &#34;Checking Connection&#34;.  It was very annoying.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read most everything Tom Clancy has put out, but this I think is his best book ever! Fast paced and non-stop action from beginning to finish. I simply could not put it down!

B003B02OQ4|5.0|John Grisham's The Client is an excellent read.  The plot development keeps the reader involved.  The characters are belieavable--in fact, so lifelike that they become \\"friends.\\"  The eleven year old boy is so real as a child that age.  The dialogue, descriptions, etc. are all top notch.
0765325950|5.0|Read & own the entire set of \\"The Wheel of Time \\", &<br />while no one can truly compare with Jordan,  I have found that Sanderson is extremely close. So close as to be nearly word perfect.  I have read the \\"Mistborn \\" series & just bought the two latest bks. My only caveat on \\"Memory of Light \\" is how Rand's. Self was transferred to Moridin 's<br />Body.  Not explained or even foreshadowed. All in all a fabulous job!  Kudos & Blessings on a Great Author<br />Bonnie Howell
B003B02O14|4.0|Standard Grisham fun read while on vacation.  Fun to read while sitting on the beach....but it is the Gisham formula.
B0063IH60K|5.0|To pass the time, it's a great time burner! Airport, waiting in lines or what ever. Suggested it to freinds.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Still pretty much a formula story but better than the Rackateer.  Easy and fun reading on the beach.  Grisham is one of my vactaion favourites.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|Man, she's breaking out with this album! This is pop! Not her soft, sultry, dark room piano playing smoky-voice wearing a black ballroom gown trying to seduce cigar smokers with her music normal. This is a pop-star branching out and trying her own things. Look at her picture for Roger's sake! Wow. She's hotter than a Texas sidewalk. I'm not going to say that I bought the album just to stare at the picture on the front. I bought it to listen to. And it's really good music, and I enjoy it greatly. But I also like to stare at the picture on the front. Just don't tell my wife.
B0013O123Q|2.0|I'll make this short and simple. I was intrigued by the polar reviews, some praised the movie for understated direction some hated the nonstop swirling of the camera. As a victim of rape I thought this movie would invoke some emotion, isn't that what a good movie is about. But for the first 25 minutes all I could make out was my reflection on the computer screen and the subtitles. The rape scene left me laughing, so obvious that this is coming from a male's point of direction. So pitiful and delicate, I swear I was watching an anime. I felt nothing for the victim (Alex) and by the time she had her head bashed in I was thinking \\"Well that's what happens when you just lay there\\". I guess I was expecting something more therapeutic, something more real. Yes it was raw and will make people uncomfortable, which seems to be the linear goal of this movie; but, and I stress this, it wasn't authentic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the best of the entire series. This is a great book. Believe me if you liked the first one then you will defiantly like this one. If you love Katniss and Peeta and want to read more of their written you should really get this book.
B000YHG72E|5.0|One of my all time favorites and one of the few DVDs I actually own. It just gets better each time I watch it.

B009L32R5I|4.0|I'm glad I bought it even if the vocals seem a little weak. Instrumentals are refreshing. Great for the price.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|As with my other LP CD's, I like this one from the first song all the way through.  Very pleased with this purchase.
B009YU7J9C|4.0|This was the most selections with a single purchase. I wish it was a Studio album, But John Wenton and Carl Palmer are worth it alone!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can hardly wait to watch the next episode!!  Beautiful sets, scenery, characters and plot.  Highly recommend -- even my husband loves the series.
B003ASLJKO|5.0|I love this movie and was so excited when I found it for sale online.  It just arrived today and I cannot wait to go home and watch it.  Clint's gruff opposite Burt's humor - just works so well.  The price was very reasonable - DVD looks to be in great condition.  I would buy from this seller again.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game.  It is fun and addictive.  Kids can play it and understand it.  The different levels are interesting.  Difficulty level is just right.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|Although I have been working in consulting for 5+ years, the book of Victor Cheng has been extremely helpful in improving my structured thinking and ways to coach people in day-to-day work.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Slow but liked it.<br />Wish that he explained more about his life.<br /> Also being a wallflower isn't being everything to everyone.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|For a kids show, this was great and the characters were interesting.  My 3 year old granddaughter wanted to see it again and again, though she probably didn't really understand everything.  Worth buying, in a few years she will grasp the story more. I enjoyed watching it, the story and characters were great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are fantastic. It takes some time to work your way into all the activities but once you get familiar with it it is a great game.

B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I started to read this book expecting something great in light of the upcoming movie. I was disappointed. I don't know why there is a movie based on it. Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining, but the book was just &#34;okay&#34; for me.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|I received my movie in the order it was instructed and it worked perfectly. I got it in the mail fast.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Bought this for my daughter to play the kinect games.<br />Make sure you have enough space available, otherwise get the zoom as well.<br />It's funny to see where the future of gaming is going to bring us.<br />It works surprisingly well, even the mic on it.<br />One thing, the mic will hear the tv and other sounds so it can be annoying to the other<br />gamers if you're in a party or playing multi player.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This movie should be required viewing for high school age students in the U.S.  It chronicles the spirit and determination of the American people.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It's not long enough for five dollars but the sale price of three was reasonable. It's a fun game with some really clever puzzles.<br />The plot is cool. I didn't like the card game alternative as much as majong though.
1609419693|5.0|First of all, it's impossible for me to be objective when it comes to Tina Fey. I love this woman. Sure, she's not knock-dead gorgeous, but her sense of humor is second to none, which just illuminates her other attributes to a whole other level. Her ability to continually laugh at herself (let's face it; not something most women are known for) is incredibly sexy. Despite my deep devotion, though, to Tina Fey I'm not exaggerating when I say this book is as hilarious as a full season of 30 Rock. Funny thing, though, while listening to this woman narrate her book, with the slightest of lisps (something I never noticed before), I kept picturing Linus from \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas.\\" Seriously, Tina Fey sounds just like Linus! Of all the Tina Feys in the world, she's the Tina Feyiest.
B001S2PT3M|5.0|Me and my boyfriend bought this series. Can't get enough anxious to watch the next season. We liked the \\"view all\\" option for the Discs so you didn't have to keep going back to the main menu to watch te next episode. Money well spent.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|The main character has a unique and fascinating point of view, and she encounters an interesting situation. This is a story about a dilemma and the way it comes to resolution, and all the stages in the process are described in a flowing manner, with attention to details and a gentle bit of humour. The main character is extremely talented in understanding  people, objects and situations, and interpreting their motives, and these interpretations are weaved through the every page of the book.

1439152802|2.0|I enjoyed the book.  However, the corners of the book were damaged because the packaging was a very thin bag which offered very little protection.

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Coin Dozer's strength is in its physics. It behaves like a true-to-life coin machine which makes it distinct among its competitionn. The thing I don't get is why the graphics are so awful. This is where they really lose me. Between the graphics and the interface, the app feels cheap and unfinished. Devs, stop outsourcing and using clip art. Get a real artist and make your good app great.
B009POCG2C|4.0|like this movie. clint eastwood is a great actor. would watch more movies with him in it.<br />not a good as torino.
B003V63VNI|5.0|Love this CD! It's great! It has the same Brandon Boyd style without Incubus! A must buy! I hope to hear more from this solo artist!
B004QKNXIQ|2.0|This script was cheap and felt rushed. I was expecting just about every joke. The best part of this movie is the stepmother, who has great lines and great voice acting and a very expressive face. The lead character is so sheltered and &#34;young at heart&#34; that I'm made uncomfortable by the fact that suddenly she's thrust into a romantic situation. It's like watching a 7 year old fall in love.<br /><br />Also, clearly that horse is just a painfully unrealistic ripoff of Altivo. It was a eprfect example of the forced humor used throughout this movie.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|Love this CD! It's great! It's not my favorite Incubus CD but I love it just the same! A must have!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I would be interested in reading the books from Christian's point of view. Not as good as the other two books, but a nice end to the series.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Loved this book.  It was slow at times but great as a young adult story.  I will definitely read the sequel if there is one.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This movie has it all and is great for any age group. The animation is top notch and the story and music are great.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I have recently felt that this series was loosing its luster but, this one sparkles.  I especially enjoyed the interesting setting in the Canadian territories and learning about diamond mining there.  The realities of life for the native population are well portrayed through the characters and plot. The romance between Temperance and Ryan went from stone cold to simmer and, that was interesting, too.  This one will cause me to read the next one.
B00797MB0O|5.0|YOUNG ADULT once again combines the directing talent of Jason Reitman with the writing talent of Diablo Cody. Their past hit film was the quirky, teenage comedy, melodrama JUNO which I enjoyed but found to be, for myself, a bit too cutesy and overly lovable in both the story and the dialogue. Now, with their second film YOUNG ADULT, it provides evidence that JUNO was not just a fluke.  These two continue to provide concrete evidence that they are great at what they do.<br /><br />This film's dialogue is dark, ironic and completely unpredictable. The story is offbeat and quirky yet somehow identifiable. Charlize Theron is brilliant as the one time high school popular girl who, now in her mid thirties, has spiraled downhill and is clutching on to her illustrious past by writing a series of teenage girl novels. Patton Oswalt steals the show as the awkward, geeky guy who had a crush on Theron in high school and, because of a tragic bullying experience, is now handicapped. They play off each others fears and quirks with hilarious and sometimes poignant outcomes. On the outside they seem like complete opposites but are more similar than either one wants to admit.<br /><br />After receiving an e-mail announcing the birth of a baby by her high school sweetheart and his wife, Theron decides that this is the most opportune time to return to her hometown and \\"rescue him\\" from an ordinary life as a husband and father and to rekindle the romance they had in high school and college.  Her ex-boyfriend is played by Patrick Wilson and he, along with the audience, is taken off guard when Theron returns and acts as if he had been waiting for her all this time.<br /><br />I won't say any more except that this film is really unique and outlandish but also very deep and complex with a showstopping scene near the end that finally brings some answers to her odd and unorthodox behavior.  This films shows what a versatile an actress Theron is.  This film along with her Academy Award winning portrayral of the serial killer, Aileen Wuornos in MONSTER, provides proof that she is not just another pretty face.portrayral of the serial killer, Aileen Wuornos in MONSTER, provides proof that she is not just another pretty face.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Having read every Harry Bosch novel, I may be prejudiced but, I have come to really know Harry with all his strengths and all his weaknesses.  Once again, Connelly manages to add to Harry's character as he navigates being single father to his teenage daughter and approaches and avoids a newer romantic interest.  I like that Harry is aging but, I do worry that Connelly is trying to bring the series to a close.  I enjoyed the mystery with attention to detail and societal attitudes of a past time.  I await Harry Bosch's next outing.

B0095VP8D4|3.0|The processor was new in box, and sealed, and looked good, but when i inspected it visually 2 full rows of pins were clearly bent at the same 30 degree angle.  Because of how tight the space is between pins, this would have had to be a manufacturing defect.  This could never have been done by a drop, or a finger.  However, with the bent pins this would never fit in a CPU slot, so i wonder if they do any QC at all.<br /><br />I used jeweler's tools to realign the pins and eventually got it to work, but having to do that kind of work doesn't give me much hope for the life of the processor.

0770435726|4.0|When Kate's husband, Dexter, is offered a lucrative position in Luxembourg, there's no reason not to accept. Not only does it mean more money and a more comfortable living for the family, but it also means that Kate can leave her job and start fresh. And for Kate that means more than you might think. Kate was recruited to the CIA in college and has led the secretive life of a covert agent for years. Even her husband has no idea what she does for a living. But now that's all behind her. Until Kate and Dexter meet another expat couple living in Luxembourg. Kate is sure that they are not who they claim to be, but is she right? Or is she simply bored living the life of an average housewife? As she digs into the identities of their new friends, Kate becomes convinced that not only are they lying, but that they may be after Kate... or Dexter.<br /><br />EXPATS is great fun and I'm not the only one who thinks so. Pavone's debut recently earned him an Edgar Nomination for the Best First Novel category.<br /><br />The book is broken up into alternating sections, beginning with present day Paris when Kate runs into an old friend. One she's not too happy to see and one that's not revealed immediately to the reader. It's clear, though, that Kate suspects she and her family are in danger. Flash back to two years ago when Dexter is offered the position in Luxembourg and the couple decides to relocate. The third set of pieces concerns Kate's time with the CIA -- beginning, end, and throughout her career. So what you get is a series of alternating chapters with cliffhanger endings: Kate discovering something present day, flashing back to Luxembourg, switching gears to her exploits as an agent. The pacing of the story is quick and borders on dizzying with all of the storylines, but Pavone pulls it off.<br /><br />It would be easy to chalk Kate's fear up to boredom as she investigates Julia, Bill, and even Dexter, but those present day chapters manage to appear each time confidence in Kate's instincts begins to wane.<br /><br />THE EXPATS is perfect for readers looking for a cleverly plotted and thrilling sort of light espionage read (and by that I mean one that isn't heavy into the political parts of the espionage game).n Kate's instincts begins to wane.<br /><br />THE EXPATS is perfect for readers looking for a cleverly plotted and thrilling sort of light espionage read (and by that I mean one that isn't heavy into the political parts of the espionage game).

0765325950|5.0|It's bittersweet to finally come to the end of an era. Robert Jordan published The Eye of the World, the first book in the Wheel of Time fantasy epic, 23 years ago. Brandon Sanderson completed the last three books after Jordan's death, and does a masterful job here concluding the series in a loving way.<br /><br />I won't spoil anything because the action is too hard-hitting and constant, and characters we've grown to know and love over these 14 books have a lot of emotional inertia. I'll just say that there are moments where you will laugh, moments you'll cry, moments that you'll want to throw the book across the room, and moments where you will just stare dumbfounded at the words you just read, then read them again. This is the kind of book that you will not want to put down.<br /><br />I won't reveal which theories I had were born out to be true and which were completely wrong, but I'll just say that I guessed some things right. Even those things I guessed right, though, were handled in ways that often stunned and shocked me.<br /><br />Thoroughly entertained. Earned every single one of those five stars.

B0052GACNM|5.0|Try to buy this one with the DVD of the recording sessions, too.  It's terrific.  Queen Latifah will amaze you, Buble is Buble; Amy Winehouse was having such a ball. Willie Nelson is terrific and shows his great respect for SIR TONY.  Tony travels to Italy to be in the home studio of Andrea Boccelli for a duet that cannot be equaled.  Lady Gaga is fantastic; Aretha is at her best; k.d. lang shows her great admiration and love for Tony is a superific duet; Sheryl Crow is dynamite.  Get this NOW!  Every voice is as you've never heard such perfection before.  When you watch the DVD of the recording, you'll see how much fun they all had making this music for your ears!
0375842209|5.0|I really enjoy WWII history and stories and I just loved this book. I keep looking for my next favorite book and I've read a few good ones, but if anything this book has ruined me as nothing quite can live up to The Book Thief. I tell anyone who will listen to read this wonderful book. Enjoy!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|FANTASTIC CD!  GET IT FOR YOUR PERSONAL COLLECTION.  You won't tire of listening to it over and over again.  She is such a masterful songstress and an exquisite lady for sure!
030758836X|3.0|This novel is composed of three very distinct sections. When reading other reviews, I saw that many people disliked section 1. Well, I truly enjoyed section 1.  The main narrator of this section, Nick, became less and less likable throughout the section, so as a protagonist, it certainly made it ridiculously hard to root for him, and even difficult to want to continue following his saga.  But I loved the setup, because it rang so true - how our parents color our relationships and views of the opposite sex, how hard it is to escape the traumas they've embedded in you, how small, seemingly insignificant, criticisms eat away at a once loving relationship, the paranoid assumptions and snap judgments people make at the person they once loved, and who they now only resent.  It speaks of how one gets to the point of utter loathing, no matter how unfair to your partner that loathing truly is. It was totally believable, and, to me, chilling.<br /><br />But then their is section 2, which , surprise!, validates those paranoid assumptions. Yes, women truly can be ridiculously contrived and crazy, the way that women-hating-men often paint us as a stereotype. They are not so off base after all - women are insane, vengeful, manipulative freaks, without remorse or humanity.  In this section, Amy is painted so contrived, so over the top, she becomes a cartoon, manipulative, villain. After Nick was so carefully drawn that he was both despicable and completely believable, it was hard to see his wife drawn simply as a cartoon psychopath, too manipulative, too alpha, to even be believed.<br /><br />I would have highly preferred if Nicks despicable nature, his assumptions about her nature, had been the impetus for her to become what he suspected, not that she simply was that all along.  It would have been much more satisfying and, in some ways, much more real.<br /><br />Section 3, well that was just a depressing let down. No closure, just purgatory. (And no, I don't think purgatory constitutes closure, not for Dezi, not for Hannah, not for Rhonda).<br /><br />I wish I had liked this book as much as the other reviewers, though I do think my opinion of it will grow with time.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I stumbled up on the first book to this series by accident. It took a while for me to get into but about half way through I was hooked. This one is ten times better than the  first. I couldn't put it down and at one point had read for so long I dreamt about it and it was so realistic I woke up confused. I cannot wait to start the third one to find out what happens  and how it all ends
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love this cd.  Full of great songs, I can honestly say I love most of them and like all of them.
B000002IWH|5.0|Bought this for a gift for my boyfriend.  He is obsessed with the movie and he used to have the soundtrack but was stolen from him.  He was very happy and surprised when I bought this for him.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Other reviews, as I recall, indicate this edition stands alone, but unless you have seen at least MIB I, you will not have any background on the development of the relationship between J & K. Being a boomer & growing up on Cocoa Beach during the Apollo days, it brought back a lot of good memories with scenes from Cape Canaveral & 60's rock music, since J has to go back to 1969 to keep a young K from being killed by the alien arch villain Boris the Animal (JUST BORIS!!!) who went back to kill K. I shall say no more tho ... :)
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|Bought this movie as a gift for my boyfriend.  This is his all time favorite movie and he only had a copy of the movie so I decided he needed the real movie with the case.  He was very happy and surprised.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|received this item so fast and I really love it. I love the way Michael Buble sings. I will always buy CD's. I love them.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|Love sleeping to the sound of the fan. This is a really awesome application. I hope everyone enjoy's it as much as I do.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great action read. I have a hard time breaking away from reading these in several days. Start w/ 1st. &#34;Killing Floor&#34;. Each book adds a little bit more to the character. Lee Child is #1 for a reason.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story line, kept me sucked in from page 1. Would recommend this book to anyone. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It is an amazing book. It was full of excitement. I want to read it again! I love this book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book. Very much looking forward to the third in the series. I think I liked it better just because I already knew the characters and settings etc. And we got right down to the story. Can't wait to see the movie.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I would highly recommend for anyone that likes ho/mystery games. very entertaining! played on kindle fire hd.
B009E3EY38|3.0|when I bought led zeppelin celabration day set, I expected when I recieved 1 blue ray & 1 dvd.  they would be bothe the Same concert. The dvd was a rehersal concert & the blue ray was the actual concert. I have not been able to watch the actual concert which was on blu ray.
B004S5FW1U|5.0|I saw the trailer for the movie and became obsessed with wanting to see the movie than I found out it was a book and made sure I read the book before the movie.<br /><br />I was expecting it to be an alright book but it swept me away with its brilliance. I highly recommend this book because it is definitely worth the read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great fun and a good time waster - teaches patience and planning.  can be played without having to purchase any extras.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|I at first thought I wouldn't like this book because I thought it would be boring but as I read the first few words I immediately became obsessed.<br /><br />This is a great book I love it, I admit I only read it because i heard of the movie but I still made sure i read it before I saw the movie and I do not possibly see a way the movie will be better than this amazing book.
B000009VOL|5.0|I never heard of Cat Power until I saw \\"Around Venezia Icam\\" on Vimeo.<br /><br />The sound track is Cat Power's \\"I Do Believe\\". Does anyone know which album this song appears in?

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read. This book will make you feel a lot of different emotions. Nice to read something with a different twist for a change.
0786891343|5.0|The book was recommended by a friend.  We read it and learned how love, faith and community can unity other rather than tear us apart.  The book is excellently written.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Every should get this game it is totally worth paying 7 dollars . It is the best game on the kindle fire . Get it know
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This series is engaging, well written, and relatable. I love the first person format and the plot twists that left you wanting more. My only complaint is that Katniss didn't end up with the guy I wanted her to.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|not my usual kind of book, but it was awesome. Real page turner. Characters were riveting and a great story
B007RTAR64|5.0|Collector piece for my young teenage daughter. Beautiful box, fast delivery. Displays nicely on my daughter's self. Good quality & cute facial features.
1451695195|3.0|I like reading books on NDEs. I loved the idea of reading a book that would describe it from the inside from a medical standpoint. And I liked the idea that the doctor was a pure scientist who didn't believe in an afterlife.The middle was great. It was detailed and the author explained things well. I was disappointed that I had to force myself to read the last chapter. Also if you're not familiar with any medical terminology, you might get lost.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Bought this for my young teenager who has read the Hunger Games trilogy. She loves her books and can't wait to collect the movie series as well.
1419702238|5.0|I bought this for a friend's son. This book was on his Christmas wish list. She told me that he read the whole book in one day! I call that success for everyone!!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Love his short stories.  This one is great too.<br />Superb writer, master writer.  Sometimes I get angry at the end of his books, not this time. Quick 're a d to pass a few minutes here or there and be entertained.
081297381X|2.0|Remember college? Remember the late night dorm room discussions on stuff like \\"why is there air?\\" Now imagine the intrusion of a student on the six year plan, no hope of graduating, who sits down and pretends to tell you what it's really like. You're going to need some absynthe for this book, baby. Because it's a horridly long string of anecdotal observations which dance around a few  points: we know less than we think, more often than we think. And it hurts.<br /><br />That's it. Everything else is just embellishment, story telling.<br /><br />Not to suggest that none of that is of value, but really? I could go to a bar and sit across the table from someone who wants to give me the unified theory of everything.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally the Pinterest app for Android.  Works well and simpy to use. Now I can view my pins on the go!!
1439153663|5.0|I read and loved this book! It was very well written and I had the feeling that every word was a direct quote from Lavinia and Belle. That's how real I thought the writing was! It was a book I put down only when responsibility yelled my name! When finished with the book, I wanted it to keep on going and tell the continuing stories of the main characters!<br />The story gave me a new understanding of just some of the atrocities the slaves had to endure silently in order to survive. I so respect their ability to hold on in really dire circumstances in far too many cases. It just shows how very strong these people were and how far they and their ancestors have come by their own toughness and tenacity!<br />I highly recommend this book if you are at all interested in what life was like for many in early America.
1603580557|5.0|this book came fast and is in great condition.. I would use this seller agian in the near future! this was a great experience
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a she that makes me lookforward to watching television again.!!Very good show with a character vase you can get into!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This is such a fantastic book, it explains why conventional diet wisdom is incorrect (how could it be when everyone is continuing to get more obese?) and the science behind WHY a low carb diet works.  I have drastically reduced my carb consumption and I have more energy than i've ever had in my adult life, I litterally feel like a different person.  Please read this book!
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|Quite refreshing to see that Asia is still Asia, unlike some other bands that not only have at most one or two original members but strain to try and sound like the original.  That's not the case with this album.  If you liked Asia 20 years ago you should like this album as well.  Very little if any drop off in creativity.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was a great read. The story line had energy, depth and kept my interest.  The mix of emotions were thought provoking and help the reader relate to the characters.<br /><br />I am excited to read more by this author!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What a treasure! I can't wait until season 3 is released, I'll definitely purchase it as well. The extra features are wonderful. I'm so glad to have this for my very small library.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Bones the complete seventh season.  I bought this for my wife for her birthday She has watched it several times love.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|great deal, great value and I strongly reccomend. Looked in many websites for it and it was the cheaper I've got.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|the characters were shallow and not very likeable.  i know nothing about the british secret services' but were they this bungling it is a wonder the country has survived at all.  the main character's alleged brilliance and depth of learning certainly were not evidenced in her personal life or interactions with her group of playmates.
1439181780|4.0|Very good book to keep you staying Positive in a sad at times world!  I have recommented this book to others and also have sent to some friends.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was my favorite of all four of the Twilight series, because it not only keeps Jacob close to Bella, but brings the series to a complete circle. Jacob was always meant to be in Bella 's life, but not as the true love of her life. That love has always belonged to Edward. This novel is riveting, action pact, beautifully written, and mesmerizing. Stephanie Meyer is one of my most favorite novelists. So thank you so much for writing 'your dream' Stephanie. God be with you forever and forever and forever.
B003QCCS36|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!!  This is one that I would play regularly.....it is definitely a keeper and placed in my &#34;play often&#34; pile.
B0083ZRAJS|2.0|Much more dark than I'd think for a children's story, especially for the time period it was written.  The mgm movie version will always be tops for me, though I can't wait to see the new incarnation with James Franco.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I liked the game so much that I rushed thru it. The graphics & style are the type I like. Didn't find it scary but it was dark. Went in knowing the cost & feel it was a fair price. Just take your time . I wish I had. Will play again soon & play it without help. I found it a good thought out mix of a game. As many puzzles as ho. Got a monkey off my back. Enjoy!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An honourable account from a very brave man.  We are in your debt.  I fully recommend this book for those who wish to know the truth.
0375703764|4.0|This book is so complicated to review.  It was like reading a work of art.  The premise is that Johnny Truant found a work by an old blind man named Zapano about a true life \\"haunted\\" house movie called the Navidson Record.  This will probably not be a very good review except to say it took me a month to read but it was worth it.  It was a strange, moving, complicated journey that you will never forget.  It will leave you wondering what the actual reality of the book was.  At one point in the book someone suggests that everyone who has come into contact with the book or movie either went insane or committed suicide.  I woke up in the middle of the night and actually felt, for some strange reason, like I was going crazy for having the book.  It was a very unsettling feeling. This book is over 700 pages long. It is like reading 3 stories in one but they blend together.  It's not just about a house, it's about people's lives and this book just may leave you with more questions than answers.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think the game is great once you start you cant stop its good and challenging. which is what you would want in most strategy games.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The author is creative and does a tremendous job of spinning a tale that compels one's interest.  I especially enjoyed the character development and the way this first book catches attention and creates anticipation for the next tale in the saga.  Can't wait!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it looks good just looking at the pictures and the video it is way better than the regular temple run
1451688091|5.0|I love this book.  It covers a lot of history of Lincoln's time, and is very engaging and interesting to read.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This game is a copy of minecraft pocket edition and you can only play for 5 minutes very bad so don't get it

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a really good book. I bought it on my tablet, and it looked great.<br /><br />Recommend on reading this.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|I like it because it has a magnetic closure not and elastic band to keep it closed. It fits my Kindle fire perfectly.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show is pretty funny and cool... hopefully they keep that up and don't change it. I recommend for everyone to watch these show.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|I grew up on transformers and, quite frankly, the 15 seconds of 'me grimlock' overheard in 'the Professional' had more going for it than ANY of these terrible terrible movies.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|This movie is good on it's own. If you have read the book you might be a little disappointed because it is not the same. Without comparing it to the book I loved it. :0)
B009K916ZK|4.0|I use this adapter with my 15\\" MacBook Pro with Retina display. We have also used it with my wife's three year old MacBook Pro, and it can be used with any Mac with either Mini DisplayPort slots (obviously!) or Thunderbolt slots (which double as Mini DisplayPort for the purposes of this adapter). While it seems a little expensive, this adapter is convenient and easy to use for anyone with a Mac who wishes to stream the internet to their TV or connect to a projector when giving a presentation. Certainly, it is just as easy to use an HDMI cable for the former, but most places I give presentations at still use VGA to connect to the projector making this adapter a necessity when traveling!<br /><br />As soon as I plug a VGA cable into the adapter, my computer recognizes the new display. Aside from the usual resolution and mirroring settings that need to be changed in System Preferences, the cable is ready to go as soon as you connect it. It is a simple device, and it simply works!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this adapter shares a design flaw with one of its siblings, the [[ASIN:B008ALA6DW Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter]], in addition to presenting one other more minor annoyance. What I think is a design flaw is that the cabling between the two connection ends is rather stiff and less flexible that I would like. This is important to me because I use this adapter in many different settings, not all of which have a lot of desktop real estate, either due to being a podium or due to restrictions on the VGA cable direction and length. I wish that the cable was a little more flexible so that the adapter would wrap better to accommodate these occasionally tight constraints, and also to relieve pressure on the Thunderbolt slot. The adapter, like the ethernet adapter I mentioned fit a little loosely in their slots and while I have yet to have a problem with them pulling or falling out while in use, I would rather they bent enough to relieve an potential strain.<br /><br />If you find yourself needing to connect to a VGA cable, this is the adapter for you. Plug and play and off you go! (as an added bonus, it is attractive - though this is not really a reason to buy any particular device, we all do it!)
0395389496|5.0|This was a great book and it had beautiful illustrations. We read it as a class and then had an entire school Polar Express day. It was awesome.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I don' t watch much TV and so missed a lot of episodes . This app allows me to catch up at my leasure.
0375707972|5.0|I had to read this for a course in college. Then I fell in love with the book. The movie is good too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show had an historical aspect to it that I especially enjoyed--a look into the past if you will.It has romance, a bit of intrigue and also ordinary people with problems. it has seriousness but still those characters that make you smile.I hope theres a season 3 coming up!!
B0000542DJ|5.0|Pretty much my favorite movie. The quality of the disc was quite acceptable :D and the movie itself was just amazing
B007TK77QE|3.0|I thought the concept of the storyline was interesting but found there wasn't enough depth to the characters.  An enjoyable read but not over the moon about it.  The Harry Potter series were far better.
B00441E2R8|5.0|I like this swatch. It is slightly difficult to look at the time because it is all black but it looks really nice!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Im a big fan of ambient noise. I cant sleep without a fan and/or the tv on. These sounds are great, they thought of almost everyone. I keep hoping for a thunderstorm around here because I love thunder but its not happening. But I have to say, it'd be nice to have more than one thunder, one that has louder crackling thunder. You know, the kind that makes u wonder if it hit a tree. Thats my kind of thunder. Also I have to agree with another user that said some sounds are obviously looped. Which gets kind of annoying. If you could make each track longer before it looped thatd be great &amp; I'm sure alot of people would appreciate it. I wouldn't mind having to download a larger file in order to get longer sounds, if thats the reason u kept them short. But, overall I really like this app. I wish I could give 3.5 stars because I want them to see the lack of stars &amp; take my advice, but I dont want to give just an average rating because people think thats bad &amp; this app is very nice &amp;, I think, really well done.
B009NT0I06|5.0|Taylor Swift is very talented artist, but to truly hear her at her best you have to get this album on Vinyl.<br /><br />I have been buying vinyl for the last 10 years. I own two [[ASIN:B0000CE6R3 Technics SL1200MK5s]] with [[ASIN:B000T9K6AQ Ortofon Nightclub]] needles. Some pressing companies are better than others. I have bought my share of albums released on vinyl in the last few years only to find a few had not used the original recording in the pressing; this defeats the whole purpose of buying vinyl. Taylor Swift's album \\"Red\\" is not one of these situations. The vinyl is thick and if there is any range compression it is minimal.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Taylor Swift and want to truly appreciate her music, buy this album on vinyl. If you do not have a quality turntable & needle, buy yourself one. You will have a hard time going back to listening to CDs, MP3's, or streaming music when you listen to how music was intended to be listened to: on vinyl.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is even better than subway surfer imma play it all day!!!!  :)  The best part is its free!!!  I RECCOMEND BUYING THIS APPLICATION!!!!!  Please take it from me-
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have always enjoyed reading books by David Baldacci and \\"The Innocent\\" really lived up to being an excellent read.  The book was fast paced and never boring.  There were a lot of twists and turns that kept me wondering what was coming next.  I look forward to the next book.

B002UM5BXW|4.0|I thought the book was very entertaining.  Light hearted look at what goes on in the kitchens. Just plain fun to read.
B002DQFEH8|5.0|Ah... if you remember this album's initial release, it's likely you had a mullet or hung out at the roller rink. Or both.<br /><br />All the great stuff is here, plus some fantastic bonus material. The mastering is pretty much as good as it can be, and there are some surprises - either the production was way ahead of its time, or pop radio in the late 90s took a serious downturn. Considering my first listen was from a cassette in a boom box I'd painted while skipping class, I'm happy with the noticeable increase in quality.<br /><br />The additional material includes some demos where you can actually hear Dee's voice without it being compressed like a finger slammed in the door of a Gremlin. Nice! What's equally amazing is that he could sing at all while having the heirlooms vacuum packed into those vinyl pants.<br /><br />If you never liked TS, don't bother. I mean, why the hell are you even on this page? But if you grew up believing you weren't gonna take it while showing your true rebel spirit by taping flashlight guts to your 4-wheel skates, get this. Cough up the pittance and show your love for 80s hair. It doesn't get any 80s hairier than this pleathery goodness.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|This story is such a true picture of time during this period of our history.  The characters come to life and you can't wait to pick it up again.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|It is a little difficult to follow.  Especially the speed of the notes to be played.  The words and Stars bothered me when I was trying to figure when I was really supposed to play the notes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. I have this loaded on my kindle as well as my ipod and my iphone.  My kids really love this game as well and my son is helping me unlock all the different characters.

B008GXHOFW|5.0|I downloaded this game for my son.  I must say he LOVES this game.  He plays this nonstop (well at least until my kindle goes dead).  I would recommend this to anyone who like Spiderman and who wants to play the game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|thisapp is great. I had it on my ipod touch.  but I had no idea you could get it on kindle fire.there is a problem with the graphics I noticed that It stops then goes again In a different place.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If you try to steal my The Piano Guys Cd, I might tear off your shoes and kick you into the snow sockless, without even a cup of hot coffee to comfort you.  You could tempt me with chocolate covered espresso beans.  You could offer me a chance to skydive into a plush, top-down Corvette with hot guys ready to smear lotion on my shoulders, and I'd say, \\"No.  No.  Forget it.  I'm listening to the most awesome piano and cello music EVER.\\"  EVER people.  That's right.  Buy the CD.  Buy, like, 25 copies of it and distribute it as a gift to clients and your employers. I'm serious.  Hand it out at Valentine's Day.  It will make even your proctologist feel loved.  It will win the heart of your mother-in-law, even if you've ground to dust every glimmer of mercy in her soul. I'm talking serious stuff here. If you ever loved yourself even a little, buy the CD.
B003V1WXKU|2.0|Not only was this book not structured in an meaningful way - it was just an extended series of anecdotes - it also portrayed a not pompous and at sometimes flat-out rude man.

B00377V6IS|5.0|By far one of the best metal albums of all time. The dvd sounds perfect if you have a sound system that can handle the 5.1 sound mix.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I read this book on advice from a friend and I was very enlightened by all the incite this book provided me into how everyone feels love and shares it.  Reading this book has given me such positive change in all my relationships, family, lover, and friends.<br />I have gone on to buy this book for 3 friends and my mom.  And I continue to recommend it to anyone who cares to want to know.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Typical action thriller from Tom Clancy. Jack junior is taking over where senior left off.Could not turn off my Kindle.
1933952806|4.0|I found the book useful and very informative, I learned quite a bit about the camera and its operations...the book overall is worth a buy...
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I love this simple little app and how you can customize the patterns. A fun way to spend a few minutes for all ages!
B00285K1KE|3.0|Good Movie. Would have preferred that it was based more on the original movie but it does have more action scenes and less drama. You will enjoy it.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|It was pretty good, but not quite as good as the first two.  Still it was worth watching and I'd consider buying the DVD.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Good Movie. Would have preferred more action scenes and less drama but to each his own. You will enjoy it.
B006BZ8WAI|5.0|&#34;See You on the Other Side&#34; was a great album in my opinion, especially &#34;Ya'll Want Another Single&#34;.  Korn III disappointed me.  I felt like something was missing.  When I hear a sample song from &#34;The Path of Totality&#34;, I knew I wanted to buy the album.  Dubstep and Korn, who could have predicted that?
B001LM1456|4.0|Great Movie. Just as much action and intrigue as the first one. Great acting and the animation presents a believable character.
B005LAIHE0|3.0|Violet (Emily Blunt) and Tom (Fason SEgel) are always postponing their marriage because other seemingly more important things have come up.<br /><br />Violet gets an opportunity to do post doctorate for two years. Tom gives up a promotion and they both move from San Francisco to Michigan. Violet does very well, her professor Winton (Rhys Ifans) extends her contract while Tom languishes at a sandwich bar and hunts deer for kicks.<br /><br />Along the way, Tom's best friend Alex (Chris Platt) and Violet's sister Susie (Alison Brie) get married and have kids. Their respective grandparents die. Tom and Violet moves apart and see other people.<br /><br />Well, the five years here is quite a long time, and I actually got the impression the longer film English Patient was shorter.<br /><br />I just thought that the characters should have realised right from the start that it is possible to balance career, marriage and kids all at the same time. They and the viewers have to take a long and winding journey to realise this. But everyone is entitled to make their own choices and live as they see fit.<br /><br />Some funny moments save the movie - such as the nymphomaniac and hyper bunny Audrey (Dakota Johnson). I was also tickled pink by Tom's foul mouthed mom. In the spirit of Farrelly brothers, there's a really weird bearded man and his verbal faux pas.<br /><br />Don't watch this if you are in a rush, the Five Year Engagement is best viewed on a lazy afternoon.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|Good Movie. Would have preferred that it was based more on the original movie (Mars) but it does have more action scenes and great graphics. You will enjoy it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I wanted a game that was simple yet kept my interest. When I get two minutes to just veg from baby, full time student and full time work,I want to actually just enjoy something relaxing and colorful and kiddie . Great game!!!!! :-)
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Good Movie. Better than the first. Lot's of action and plenty of great stunts. I think You will enjoy it.
B008ANFRGQ|3.0|Vai is one of the most innovative and original guitarists of the past 20 years, no doubt, but with this release he sounds like he quietly slipping away into his retirement years. It is an aged & mature Vai that is presented here. He is no longer interested in impressing the masses as much as he is playing what sounds soothing to his aged ears. We should not expect to hear Vai to ever duplicate Passion or Alien Love Secrets or Fire Garden ever again; to do so would be unrealistic and foolish.<br /><br />Some of the best tracks are \\"John the Revalator\\" (which is the best cover I have heard of the song), \\"Gravity Storm\\", \\"The Moon and I\\" and \\"Weeping China Doll\\" everything else sounds like filler material that could've been better placed on a b-side album. Instead of finding hot envelope pushing & innovative guitar playing, you will find serene sound-scapes with matured cerebral songwriting. Vai has his moments, of course, but his best days are behind him. If you are looking for modern envelope pushers check out Animals as Leaders, Behold....The Arctopus, Ron Jarzombek & Guthrie Govan. I would recommend this for die-hard Vai fans only. I am glad I didn't purchase it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I finished it in three days.  Now I am working on Gillian's book Dark Places.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Once  I  started reading I couldn't stop. Colleen keeps you on the edge of your seat. I can't wait to start the next book written by her.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I got this game with my Kindel Fire for Christmas so I thought I'd try it.  The game is not challanging enough for my mentally.  I am not one for video games.  I would rather read a good book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I think it could very well be made into a decent movie.  It is a story of human innovation and commitment, on several levels.  A good mix of light heartedness and life threatening drama.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|This was a cute movie. I liked the portrayal of both mothers-to-be and the fathers-to-be. Some parts were cheesy, but overall it was good.
B007YOC4RW|4.0|Very typical of his style.  If you like even some of his songs, you should enjoy this cd as well.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Season 7 is awesome! Closing episode is a real nail-biter! Glad to see Booth and Bones together as a family- waited too long for that one!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was interested in reading the continuing story of the Hunger Games series. I didn't like this one as much as the first. I think the author overemphasizes the character's need to rescue others and her distrust of everyone else. But I'm glad I read it, and I plan to order the third in the series.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved the historical aspect.  Book has huge cast of characters with events taking place all over the world.  It's hard to imagine how Follett can keep track of all intertwining characters, events and locations.  Looking forward to the next one in the series.
B005LAJ212|5.0|i watched revenge when it was on tv.  i bough the first season so my wife could watch it.  what a wonderful story line. how could anyone not get so involved that you can't wait for the next revenge?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My favorite book is catching fire then the hunger games and than the mockingJay but good trilogy I would recommend it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is fun and easy.  You can do all of the things someone would do with a real horse.its good if you have kids like me that love horses. I reccomend this app to all horse lovers!!!
1451696191|5.0|The book came in no time. I would definitely purchase again. I'm very satisfied with the condition as well :)
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I was very pleased with this collectible item !!!!!! I couldn't wait for it to arrive in the mail and was pleased when it did! Thank you very much
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|All I need is this book...and the ashtray, the paddle game, the remote control, and these matches,and this lamp, and this magazine and this chair.....
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Crossed is a great sequel to Matched, it definitely as good as Matched but still an intriguing read. I am looking forward to Reached.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|A must for Kate Morton fans, she has delivered another memorable read with some heart-stopping twists. Can't wait for the next one.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|It was dissapointing. Lame compaired to the others and just unfunny. I.was super exited to read it and it was a.terrible let down.
B009M1QRM8|5.0|I love all of the Agent Pendergast novels and hope they keep going with them. A must for DP fans. Highly recommended.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I been downloading some of my phisical books, this was a must have on my iPad.  Exellent is better for me this time around<br />.
0765325950|4.0|This series has been one of my favorite fantasy ones to read and as sad as I am to see it end, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed how they ended it.  The last battle is finally here and the three ta'veren must bring all of their unique talents to have a chance to defeat the Shadow.<br /><br />When reading a series like this with multiple characters, you always develop your favorites.  And mine were Matt and Elayne, so I particularly liked this one as he dominated the story.  The battle scenes (which those two are heavily involved in) dominate the book and are on the epic scale of some of the Lord of the Rings battles.  This book is constant action, unlike others, as all the story lines are developed and now all that's left is to fight the Shadow.  So trust me, you'll get into it and read the book quickly.  Even though the book is large, it only took me two days to read as I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />All in all, it was a fitting end to a fun series.  If you liked the other books, you won't be disappointed.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I luvved the book!! I the reader completely loved this book so much I would read it again nuff said
B009AP2G26|5.0|GREAT writing, superb acting and lively music.  It is a challenge to find programming like this on TV nowadays...kudos to Glee!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would recommend to anyone!!! This is a most read! This is my new favorite book!!! Read it in two days could not put the book down
B00004Z459|4.0|I love the CD and it works but track number 8 which happened to be my favorite doesn't work but besides that I'm satisfied
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I love this book and will read the sequels. It's a very good love story with a twist. Totally recommend it.
098478280X|5.0|The book was in new condition when I received it. Delivery was on time as well. I had no problems with the received book.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I think that Rick Riordan could of done a little bit better with the description of the book meaning word choice
B009VB97EY|4.0|I just rented this app movie but it was very clear and nice to have on the road and be able to use while not connected to the internet. Then it deletes from the kindle after the rental is over very handy!<br /><br />Movie was okay if you are a young person who is single and likes to sleep around :-) but want more out of life
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this game<br />It's definitely a great download . Must have if you love horses and interactive games. I give it two thumbs up
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I have not used the app at all very much but it is a very clear app and seems to be user friendly and very bright and clear
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a free download for me, so I didn't expect much but I was pleasantly surprised at the story!  The characters were fun and the storyline was fresh and interesting.  This will stay on my kindle as a re-read.
B009SQRC9E|5.0|Great quality and is very clear too bad I could have not purchased it on DVD and then downloaded it to my kindle but overall great movie great app
0547848412|4.0|It is an entertaining book.  I want to see the movie to see how film follows the story.  It's fiction so anything is possible.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I am better off going to my web and then typing in [...] and using that one this app looks nice but does not have the bells and such that [...] has
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Compelling and helps you to understand the insight and beliefs of our men and women that are putting their lives on the line.  The writer also helps us to understand how the news and politicians affect our military.  These people need to be able to defend themselves by any means that is necessary.  The news media and liberal politians need to be trying to put themselves in their position.<br /><br />The enemies of the USA are not citizens.  They are enemies willing to kill any  Amercian including our babies.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|This is my daughters favorite movie! She loves to dance to the music in it and is so entertained by the colors! Great digital copy for the Kindle fire
B002EEP3NO|5.0|This Lego is very expensive and I understand many people will think it is crazy to spend $300/$400 for something like this. However this a wonderful Lego, and it will take you several days to built it. The details are amazing and it is really fun to build (except it is very hard to distinguish the 3 grey color and the black in the instructions).<br />The box is subdivided in 4 boxes, corresponding approximately to each floor of the death start and it take several hours to go through one single box. The figurines are really well done and for some of the characters appear several times so that you can place them in different scenes. The death star has an elevator, the &#34;shrinking&#34; garbage room, and many other moveable parts which make the lego entertaining even after it is built.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is large enough for anyone of any age and is very clear and is FREE is does many things a hand held one can do
B008MA83HC|5.0|This is a great compilation of their best hits. If you are a huge fan (as I am!), you will not be disappointed. The two new songs are a wonderful addition to this album.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great for any age! It is really good for your mind I would recommend it 100% for anyone especially older people.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I thought this was the best Kate Morton I've read.  She was at the<br />top of her writting game with The House at Riverton.  It is a true<br />page turner!
B00A757EFW|1.0|I never could get this game to come up.  Coin Dozer cme up instead.  Have not been able to get Pac-Man
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We enjoy this show very much. You get to see the lives of all the characters.<br />We did a weekend marathon with the past shows and got hooked.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good storyline.  Didn't get 5 stars only because it lost my interesst when he went into the technical details and took pages to tell about the bullet between release and hiting the target.  Otherwise a good read.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great book as all of his are. I am only sorry I finished it and will now have to wait for the next one.
0060922583|2.0|This might serve as a source for some interested in the current fervor over extending the methods of holography to a very broad range of topics, including the physics of both, perception, and cosmology. As a physicist, with background in psychology, I find both of those projects to be totally unfounded, and pretentious.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Purchased this DVD after seeing the movie in the theater. Love the music. Very Funny!!! Great movie to watch with friends when you just want to &#34;hang out.&#34; My son is in an a cappella singing group, and I even got him to stay home and watch it with me!!! Arrived on time and as described! Thank you!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I have enjoyed watching season 1 and 2 of Downton Abby. The characters are interesting and entertaining. Season three promised to continue in this vein, and so far it has. This show is a great getaway from the cares of daily life.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|The antivirus software on my Kindle and the Kindle itself stated that this was infected and it could not be installed.<br /><br />I am rewritting my review this loaded and it is a very nice app.  It is simple to use and a nice addition to the Kindle HD.  I know you can access the camera without a paid app but I found this easier to use!  I would recommend this and it also allows you to record video.
B004LX0D36|5.0|I enjoyed this classic story with its victorian era language and courting customs.  It was a refreshing, sensible love story with surprise twists in the plot.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Graphics are really good on this as are the sounds.  It would be nice to have some more hints as this game gets difficult in parts of it and you become frustrated with it.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Les Miserables is a family favorite anyhow, but to be able to hear the music at home or in my vehicle now is pure joy! This soundtrack is soooooo good, as live versions surely are. What emotion! &#34;To love another person is to see the face of God!&#34; Indeed!
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Offers quite a few sounds and is well done.  The sounds are realistic and there is a nice variety of sounds.  This offers several more sounds than the Lite edition of this app.  I tried the Lite Edition, which was free,  and liked it well enough to purchase.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|written with an incredible knowladge to extraordinary analists<br />my vision changed completely after reeding the book ,<br />I am an internatinal investment advisor,,,,, that change also my way to do my job
B004UID2LC|5.0|this is the app for you to be able to load some of your videos on your Kindle.  I have the Kindle HD and this worked well for me.<br /><br />Oh, and it is free.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I finished reading this book at three in the morning. I could not put it down. It was military history that read like a thriller. Knowing these men are on our side helps me sleep easier at night.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Quality sound, easy to find music can be sorted by artist, genre, or song title.  Each genre seems to have a good variety of stations to choose from.  It is also easy to switch from station!  It is easy to use and you can leave it turned on while you switch to reading a book or a magazine.  This offers every type of music from classical to country.  There is nothing about this app that I did not like.<br />This is one of my favorite apps.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly does it again. In fact this just might be his best book in a while.<br />Can't wait for the next one.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was awesome and cool apps for the moon and maybe even a big baby is okay with that in the moon
B00631VJIC|4.0|Thought is was going to be more of the music from the series, not just a few songs, disappointing maybe should have ordered a different CD but do enjoy the music that is on this one
B000002LND|5.0|I can not sing the praises enough about this wonderful collection o all of Madonnas greatest hits. I listened to it from start to finish, and enjoyed every single song.. Lucky Star, Like a Virgin, Vogue, La Isla Bonita, Papa Don't Preach..and the list goes on and on! This Cd is a must have for any serious Madonna fan. This trip down musical memory lane was amazing and enjoyable..Get it asap!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|How many times have you heard a song and couldn't remember or didn't know who sang it. Shazam to the rescue. I love this app. And it's so simple to use.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I ordered this dvd set for my wife, this was one of her many Christmas gifts she received. We began watching these dvds together, she watched all five dvds in a two day marathon! The picture quality is superb, we both agreed we would love to travel to Downton castle. While taking a break between dvds I returned to Amazon to get the release date for season three. I got the Blu ray limited edition set and I plan to surprise her with season three later this month.
B000VH4OCW|5.0|I bought this album back in the late 70s when it was new and was bowled over by it. I'm still bowled over. I consider this one of the greatest albums ever recorded.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|My favorite ambient sound apps let me mix sounds.  For example heart beat maybe useless, but add it to rain and maybe it is what you are looking for.  Also there is a limited selection of sounds, mostly noise type sounds.  There are a few on the website, but I tried downloading one and the app didn't show it.  There are only a few on the website anyway.  So needs more sounds, like soft music types, and needs to be able to mix together sounds.  Not good that it keeps running in the background even if not playing a sound.<br /><br />On the plus side the timers and alarms are pretty good.  Nice amount of options.  The clock display is OK, and it is nice that each sound has a picture.  Some sounds are rather unique, like car rain, or purple noise...<br /><br />Might be good if other apps don't have the base sound you are looking for or you need a complicated timer/alarm setup.
B004QX07G4|3.0|It's great to read Ellen's words and &#34;hear&#34; her speaking them in my head, but the book was a little boring, to be honest. And I love Ellen. Glad I bought the e-book version.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was very intense! It makes you want to keep reading it. I finished it in only two days!
0385484518|5.0|My mother read this to my ailing grandmother and they both enjoyed it.  My mother especially enjoyed it.  Great concepts regarding care for the dying and not wanting to consume the lives of your family members.  Great book!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was confusing in the beginning. But as the story unfolds itself, everything becomes clear. The ending was just totally unexpected.
8866130931|2.0|The planner is described as a large weekly planner but it is only about the size of half a sheet of paper. Not big enough for my needs. All could of been avoided if I just read the measurements. My fault. They do make a bigger size. Not sure what they call that one X-large maybe.
0425252868|5.0|A Higher Call is a WWII aviation book written by knowledgable aviation historian Adam Makos about a very unique and true happening in the war torn skies over Germany.  I was very familiar with this incident, thinking I knew most of what occured. . .boy was I wrong!  Adam filled in many minute details (which I also crave!) and brought the entire combat histories of pilots Franz Stigler and Charlie Brown to life!  Adam personally interviewed each pilot at length to legitimize this amazing story.  An easy read that will keep you on the edge of your seat - and even the casual WWII onlooker will read this book with a heightened interest! One of the truly great books on the Luftwaffe/8th Air Force, and one you definitely should read!<br /><br />Mike Crosman
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|Good read. Heath gives a lot of good tips on accepting change, dealing with change, and managing everyday decisions we make. The fact that most of his thesis is supported by actual research, or life experiences make it more worthwhile to read.. A lot of sociology, politics, and economics combined
B0061S073A|5.0|Love this app! To protect kids from going every every on the kindle, you can select the app you want your kid to use, which is nice and it is all on one page! You can also put a time on that stops them when time is up. However I wish the timer made noise so I know the time is up. My son tries to figure out the password
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This was in the GF's wish list this year.  Haven't heard any complaints from her about it yet, so I'll go ahead and say it's an excellent item.  I myself, I refuse to watch any of this SITC stuff, but it keeps her occupied so I can watch my stuff in a different room.
B0054S6N04|5.0|Romance: 9 DEFINITELY. Just read it.  He is SMOKIN HOT!<br />Sex Scenes: 8 you get the details and there are a lot sexual tension that's worth the wait.<br />Friendship: 7 stong friendships between the ladies AND between the main guy and girl.<br />Intelligence: 8 there is a solid story here.<br />Humor: 7  I laughed out loud at some parts.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I have the norton app on my phone and I was warned to delete this app since it had malware. Do not download.
B001TODCII|5.0|Really one of the better action films made in recent years!<br /><br />Top notch acting,great film work,outstanding fight sequences and a storyline that is compelling for any man or woman out there with a pulse.More spellbinding than any horror flick,because this is a reality based concept.<br /><br />What I find most commendable is that as violent and adult in nature as the theme of the movie is,there is precious little profane language,little or no graphic bloody scenes and no nudity that I can think of. A sign of quality filmmaking. The raw essence of the theme is well communicated without the gratuitous muck.
B0063IH60K|1.0|every time I touch this thing there's another ad. I deleted it and I wouldn't recommend downloading it.  waste of space.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The begining was interesting and I enjoyed the story.  Sometimes you just want something easy to read and this was a good one.
1419705849|5.0|my eight year old daughter say the book was very interesting and funny and she was very happy with the book
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|This is an addictive game. You can build your islands and use your workers to mine and upkeep them to earn doubloons and expand your territory. You sail off on expeditions and complete quests to earn prizes. What I don't like about the game is how it encourages you to spend real money to buy more doubloons and gems (I have only earned them). If you don't buy coins you have to wait a long time for your expansions (overnight).
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I always did love watching the Dracula movies,but the book is much better.<br />For the book pulls you into the story and I couldn't  stop reading it until I was done reading the whole book.<br />I say that everyone should read it st least once.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I've played a lot of these games, and this is definitely one of the better ones. The graphics are great, there isn't a ton of dialogue, a lot of different levels to keep you interested and playing for a long time. The only thing a bit frustrating is the elevator when you have to get around but other than that, I love it! I can't wait to see more like this game!!<br /><br />Note: this is one of those games where you get into it then you have to pay to play the rest, but honestly I thought it was more than worth it for the three or four bucks.
B0086700CM|3.0|Honestly I am dying to know when the temple run 2 game is going to come out on the kindle fire. The game has been out for weeks now where is it???
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|Songs are good but acting and the plot is subpar at best with a storyline that is oddly connected together.  You wont regret skipping this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this book. It was easy to read and definitely kept my attention. I would love to meet Holder in real life.<br />The only negative would be that I could usually figure out what was going to happen next, but still had to keep going.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|I read this as part of a collection for potential summer reading novels at our high school.  We chose to read this book next summer.  The author tells a very compelling and engaging story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|PBS has outdone itself with the airing of Downton Abbey -- all 3 seasons.  It is far and away the best thing to watch on television.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|NOT IT IS THE BOMB!!!!!!! I like it more than my wwe app. Get it now. It is so awesome.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Best John grisham  I have read in years ! Couldn't put it down! He has done it once again !
B00007ECLA|4.0|A previous reviewer critiziced the production of this concert and they are correct. There's not much going on other than the music and thankfully the music is great. The camera work is not creative however if you're into watching musicians play and singers sing, you'll love it. At first I thought that the audio was mixed with a little too much volume from the audience until I realized that the audience participation, which is impressive to say the least, is a big part of this show. You feel like you're part of the audience but up close to the stage. As good as Laura is you don't really see her true vocal ability until she slows it down and switches from upbeat pop to the Jazz influenced \\"One More Time\\" which just happens to be the only song in English which not surprisingly has zero audience participation. This concert prompts me to find a concert with less emphasis on Laura's Pop-Rock hits and more R&B inspired songs.
B00136JPB0|3.0|I was originally interested in the song &#34;So Real,&#34; but since the whole album was only $2.99 and the clips from the other songs seemed pretty cool I figured why not. The music is really pretty and the sound is sweet (I don't mean that in the &#34;Dude! Sweet!&#34; kind of way) but they're not quite my taste.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this is a fave game love the graphics which are really nice I like Ho with adventure I have played quite a few G5 games with out any problems on my Kindle Fire
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|Listening to this reminds me of the first tme I heard this cd in 9th grade! Forever a RATM fan!

B00AEFVRB2|5.0|I'm amazed at the number of bad reviews this film has gotten. It is, for sure, not for everyone, but many of these reviews operate as if characters need to be likable in order for a film to be worth watching--an utterly bizarre and puritanical stance to take on a piece of art.<br /><br />In any case, the acting in this film is superb. I mean really top notch. The writing is super sharp. And I got this kind of pleasure in watching just how bizarrely messed up this morally degraded bunch of idiots and sociopaths could be together.<br /><br />Yes, there were a couple of shocking scenes, and everyone in the film is a moral monster, but it's all so well done: suspenseful, tense, full of menace, and funny in the bleakest possible way. If you're not super sensitive, I'd say ignore the bad reviews, and give it a shot--you may just think it's great.

B0093X805W|5.0|This book is truly the ultimate in timeless classics!!<br /><br />My teacher read this book to our class 40 years ago.  It was then that I fell completely in love with Roald Dahl’s writings!<br /><br />I’m currently reading this book to my 6th grade homeroom class and they have sat riveted the entire time.  Before I start reading I provide each of them with a piece of chocolate. I’m a firm believer that one can’t listen to the book or watch the movie (the original, of course) without having such, as one is going to start instantly craving chocolate.<br /><br />Roald Dahl’s funny and semi-creepy writing style never disappoints!
B006LSZECO|5.0|You would have thought that it is two completely different writers, as you get toward the middle of the novel.  What a great twist of events!!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|When I found out that they were coming out with a new album, I honestly jumped for joy. I loved their first album Sigh No More. And when I listened to the samples of the songs for this album, I knew I loved everything about it, and have been dying to purchase it. I finally did last night(on Google Play, they had a deal to die for) and it's absolutely amazing. Every song is just, wow. Personally my favorite is Ghosts That We Knew. But anyway, anyone who decides to purchase this album will not regret it all.
B00A135YUW|3.0|I liked her first album (as Lana Del Rey) it provided some chill background / lounging music.  This album is not close to the first album and just seem like a rehash / repackaging of her first album.  I'm glad she landed the endorsement deal with Jaguar.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Such a great book! I don't know what to say. It made me cry, it made me want to live life to the fullest, it made me feel all sorts of feelings. Hazel and Augustus are two remarkable characters who understand each other so well. Their bodies have suffered but they try not to let it bother them. There is so much to say, but I don't want to give any part of the story away. It's just a beautiful and well-written story. Yes, there will be tears, but the way you feel after you've read the book...it's almost life changing.
