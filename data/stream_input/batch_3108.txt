B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Works as advertised, 2+ charges on my Droid Razr M - also charges my 2 Galaxy Tab 2 7\\" tablet. Charges my phone as fast - or maybe faster_ than the wall charger. Amazed some friends at a football game when I pulled it out and plugged it in - since it's about the same size as my phone, it just stacked behind it and I kept on going! Can charge two devices at once, and holds its own charge really well. Indicator lights seem reasonable accurate so far.<br /><br />The cable plug is backwards (hard to describe) for the side the charger port on the Razr so I have to twist the cord to stack them while using the phone. The included cable is just long enough for that.<br /><br />I do need to remove my case ([[ASIN:B009N1K3R2 Speck Products SPK A1670 Fabshell Motorola]] for the charging plug to fit all the way into the port. I was going to hold back a star for that, but its really not Anker's problem that my case blocks their charger!

B00BAXFAJC|5.0|The lunar cycle, astrology, and New Zealand history are all woven into a suspenseful tale about murder and thievery in the Victorian style of Wilkie Collins, say, or perhaps the Trollope of \\"The Eustance Diamonds.\\" It's divided into 12 parts each with one chapter fewer than the one before--meant to symbolize the waning of the moon (part twelve of twelve, with but one chapter,  is entitled \\"The Old Moon in the Young Moon's Arms\\"). And as the chapters dwindle in length, the \\"in which\\" introductions, in the Victorian manner, increase. There are 12 celestial characters, each representing one sign of the zodiac (be not afraid if you don't know astrology: it helps, but not essential), plus seven more characters, dubbed \\"planetary,\\"and there's one under \\"terra firma.\\" This is all laid out in the author's character chart. Of those planetary characters, it would appear that the luminaries of the title are Anna Wetherell (the moon) and Emery Staines (the sun), and the actions of the other characters on the planetary side revolve around them, while the stellar characters, with secrets of their own, manipulate and are manipulated, in the astrological way.<br /><br />If this sounds as though it would be hard to pull off, well--not for Ms. Catton, 28 at the time she snagged a Booker Prize for this astonishing work. It's all so seamless. I gasped at the way she merges the structure with the intricate plot. And yet, despite her recent triumph I feel sorry for her--anything she does from here on out is going to be compared with this book, and reviewers will complain, \\"it's no 'Luminaries.' But with her remarkable intelligence and dazzling prose style, I imagine she'll continue to rock the literary world.<br /><br />According to an interview (in the National Post of Canada) Ms. Catton, who teaches creative writing in Auckland,  often starts off \\"a class by saying to my students the goal of what we're trying to do is to create things that do not yet exist in the world. To create connections between words, or to create poems or stories that don't exist yet.\\"<br /><br />And so she has--created something that didn't previously exist, and that nobody will be able to duplicate. And for once, mes compagnions, hoist your glass as I allow you to join the Amazon Review drinking game while becoming what must be the 9 millionth Amazonian to say of a book, \\"the ending is rushed.\\"<br /><br />Deliberately.ctions between words, or to create poems or stories that don't exist yet.\\"<br /><br />And so she has--created something that didn't previously exist, and that nobody will be able to duplicate.

B00AAX68HG|4.0|Good for kids or grownups. Fun time killer. Great free app. Daughter loves how the creatures talk. Some levels too hard for a nearly 5 year old.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|I wouldn't have minded it been more thought provoking, but still fun to read I suppose. I also didn't like how it used fiction the way it did.
B00FLNRN06|3.0|\\"While not a film to shout out about, We're the Millers, after a successful run at the box office ($150m gross to date), was surprisingly good and funny too. Jason Sudeikis plays a loser of a drug dealer who ends up on a gig to smuggle in Mexico by covering-up in disguise with a fake family consisting of a stripper, an awkward teenager, and a troubled teenager who prefers stealing things.<br /><br />The film's execution is pretty much similar to what you may find in a National Lampoon Vacation film with Chevy Chase but with more vulgarity and sex and drug-related humour which explain its R-rating. Nevertheless, the film's subversive nature is what may stand out for some when you consider some of its more satirical elements present by mocking the ridiculousness and stereotypes of drug dealers, kingpins, and the U.S. Border Patrol and immigration law (if Breaking Bad was a straight-out comedy that had cannabis and Mexico and Colorado as the settings).<br /><br />However, it is the more crazier scenes that are more striking here and Kenny, the awkward teenager, is the one and only character that I thought stole the whole film for me. His charisma and presence is so bizarre and simple he does not even mean to come across as crude or offensive when he does. He reminded me a lot of Milhouse van Houten from The Simpsons especially knowing that his parents hardly care for him anyways. His issues trying to deal with women by kissing his so-called sister and mother and singing/rapping out TLC's landmark song, \\"Waterfalls,\\" are what steal the film for me. In addition, a special scene toward the end with Jennifer Aniston (SPOILER ALERT) hearing the Friends theme song makes her smile and cringe was a stealer too (SPOILER ALERT).<br /><br />But the film felt a bit ordinary at parts compared to films that I really liked before that are similar like Without a Paddle and Wild Hogs but it had more going it and was at times funnier and out-there than the modern prince of R-rated comedy, The Hangover.\\"y, The Hangover.\\"

0316322407|5.0|The background information on the history and geography of this region of Pakistan was very informative.

0141345659|5.0|This book is art itself. I read this for a school project and I'm so glad I did. When you get to Page one, you fall in love with a girl named Hazel who has cancer. It took me only a day to read it because, it was one of those books that you can't put down. I recommend this to everybody because, I was blessed to have read this. And after reading this book, I've read John Green's other books.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Thu  game is available to play without having to spend money to get the extra gems. You breed dragons to create so many more and decorating  your own village to how you like. There are  so many dragon  you can get it is endless. Th  only thing I do no  like about the game is that it is not available to play without internet connection.
0446310786|2.0|I had to read this as a school project and I hated every second of this book. Sure there were times that it was interesting and good and I understand the time period but, it always had the 'N word' in every sentence. I didn't like it.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This gets only 5 stars because that is as high as you can rate it! This is by far the best platformer EVER! A must have definitely.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Many of the reviews are complaining that once you get to level 35 you have to pay too advance. This is only true for those you have added a Facebook account to the game to remove your Facebook account from the game open up the game before possessing play click the arrow in the corner and remove your account easily from there that way you just have to pay 3 artists to advance
B005LN5UOC|2.0|Took forever to finally get this found as discoverable Sony Bluetooth settings.  The manual is only about 9 pages in English (listed under GB for Great Britain).  Of those pages, I only found about 2-3 to be really informative.  The set up asks you to hold the power button down until it flashes blue / red, then when it flashes every 2 seconds it's connected / every 4 seconds for not connected.  Pairing this device is fine, it worked.  But how about a connect or pair button that isn't the power button?  After all this, the audio was bad on my end & must've sounded even worse on the other as players continually commented on the static sounds coming from my mic.  This could be just a particular server or connection speed, but it seemed annoying.  The most annoying, though, was the headset design.  I honestly can't wear this.  The top earhook was not as flexible as I thought & read on the box it would be.  In fact I spent most of my time in game readjusting the earhook to try to keep it stabilized on my ear.  Personally, for the money this will probably work ok for most people.  But honestly, I would rather play without a bluetooth set & have a clunking wired set than this.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed Ender's Game. I felt like I was taken on the same journey as the title character. It kept my interest from start to finish.
1451635672|5.0|Marvelous, accurate telling of the story of Las Vegas in the seventies and early eighties , of &#34;The Boys&#34; who ran the Strip---and who ran it i to the ground---as their personal lives followed suit. I lived in Las Vegas during those days and can  attest to the truth of this story.
B00AWJYJVA|2.0|Disappointing. have read all Le Carre novels to date. This one, plot was weak; story unfinished rather than left the reader in suspense. Seemed like a pot boiler rather than serious.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I SUDDEN UNDERSTAND WHY THAT EPISODE OF SUPERNATURAL WAS CALLED 'ON THE HEAD OF A PIN' AND MANY OTHER AMAZING REFERENCES
B00GHIX46G|4.0|On the whole, I think television now is lousy.  I'm sick of the millenials' deep desire for angst at the cost of both plot and acting.  First of all, I've watched the entire season to date, and I still have no idea what this team actually does.  Sometimes they go after some guy with super powers, but their reasoning for choosing seems flimsy.  Sometimes, apparently, they investigate regular crime.  They have some fun characters, but the raison d'etre is pretty lacking, and the brooding thing is far overdone (thanks again millenials).  I keep watching because it seems to me the show has the potential to be as interesting as the actual strip.  Seems like this would be a good vehicle for questioning status quo ideas like \\"We have to keep this secret from ordinary citizens.\\"  \\"Why?  Are you assuming we are smarter than they are?  Maybe you should take a history course in the genius of bureaucrats.\\"  Outside of this, I'll probably go back to books.
B002RVCD0U|4.0|Redeems the Terminator movies with awesome action scenes and food for thought. The Batman voice is a bit tiring but at least John Connor is a hero instead of a whiny kid and Arnold doesn't have a real role in this one. I enjoyed it.

B00DW1WR14|4.0|So on October 15th 2013 Pearl Jam released their 10th studio album. Having taken a few weeks to digest it all,I realize my initial instincts were correct: Lightning Bolt is mid-level Pearl Jam.<br /><br />It's not on the same level as VS or Vitalogy or Yield or even the self-titled 2006 album. It's about on a par with their previous album Backspacer and ahead of Binaural and Riot Act, which were Pearl Jam's two weakest albums (not bad though. Pearl Jam has yet to make a bad album).<br /><br />Mind Your Manners recalls the hard rock attack of 1994's Spin The Black Circle with more of a punk element. Sirens is easily one of Pearl Jam's best ballads, close to a par with Black and Yellow Ledbetter. The title song rocks out and recalls Springsteen in spots while Infallible recalls classic Pearl Jam and Pendulum shows some branching out.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that there's exactly filler here. But there are a few cuts that don't quite stand-out.<br /><br />On the whole this is a solid 4 star Pearl Jam disc (on the 1 to 5 star scale). They may not be in the limelight as much as they were in the 90s. But they're stil making great music.

B00CR1DX9A|4.0|Cute and clever, with a few spelling and grammar mistakes, nothing that couldn't be cleaned up by a good copy editor.
B0044K037M|4.0|I first heard Right Off at 2am on a Boston Rock station while working an overnight shift. I couldn't believe the cool jazz rock fusion groove. John McLaughlin and Miles. Nuff said. The other track is a bit mellower, but Right Off is over 20mins so it's worth it. It could be a forerunner to acid jazz, chill, downtempo...
0679720200|5.0|Loved it! Definitely recommend to all my friends. A must for Christmas gifts for all your family and friends yes
B002VHI8FE|5.0|The first part of the book was action packed but seemed to have no cohesive plot. Boy was I wrong. Came back and bit me in the butt it was such a gathering of misfits, unique characters, interesting twists and just plain plot development. Even though there was lots of action, it SEEMED plodding at times. He hard slog was worth it as the author was just playing the direction of the story close to the vest. I actually put this book down for a while and came back, starting again at page one. As my title to the review is one requiring stick-to-it-ness. By the end of book one you realize this author really has his story togethet. He reminds me of Stephen Baxter in direction. HE knows where he wants to go with this and if you cannot figure out the direction you will miss the pot at the end of the rainbow. There are still mysteries to clear up. I hope answers start forming in book 2. It is not fair to keep too many secrets from your readers. HIGHLY recommended but not for the hasty....shu
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is wonderful! I was so sad when it ended. I have been reading a lot of metaphysics books and this is in the top 3 with The Map by Boni Lonnsburry and The Quantum Physicists series by Greg Kuhn. They all contain extremely USABLE information for internal/external change. If your looking for more than esoteric text you've found it! I only wish it had a Suggested Reading list at the end. The author mentions so many good books. I had to stop during reading and find the book mentioned on Amazon and put it in my wish list and then go back to reading. Maybe her next book will have one HINT HINT :)
1410404897|5.0|This is a very well written retelling of Emma that makes you want to keep reading and not put the book down until you are done. This book does a great job of making you feel you understand what is going on in Mr. Knightley's mind and better understand his actions. If you don't love Mr. Knightley before you read this re-telling you will love him by the end and if you do love him already you will love him even more!
B00CN3U8TA|5.0|This is a great action figure of Thor in his costume from Thor The Dark World. It's recommended for ages 8 and up on the box.    Very nice sculpt, paint, and articulation. Very good likeness to Chris Hemsworth. The cape doesn't make the figure fall over like the first movie Thor figure sometimes would, its just the right length. The gold color isn't really screen-accurate but it's still nice. I really like that they went with the sleeveless look this time, but it also would have been great if they made an armor-sleeved version too. He stands at about 7.75 inches tall.    Accessories: his hammer Mjolnir with the new version of the handle in this movie, and a base that connects with the Jane Foster figure's base.    Articulation: ball-jointed head, torso, shoulders, and hips; swivel at upper biceps, wrists, and upper thighs; double-hinge knees; single-hinge at elbows and ankles which also rock side to side. These allow you to get some nice poses with him.    Overall a great figure, my personal favorite from Marvel Select. Looks great displayed with other movie Marvel Select figures.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This season is one of my favorites in the series and does a great job of establishing the characters and the relationships that they continue to build on throughout the rest of the series.
0375413405|5.0|Who would have believed that I did not know how to cook?  Well, I found out that I didn't.  Heck, I am a good cook who serves tasty and healthy dinners, but they are so BORING!! Every cookbook I read, whether it is the local &#34;church&#34; or best seller or online recipe or older books all have the same recipes. I mean they are different from one another by a pinch of this or an addition of that but they all end up tasting the same. You can go to any  covered dish get together and find that all the same dishes have been prepared that taste pretty much alike and I don't care how long you have been cooking.  BUT now wait, this book, this excellent book takes you where you have never been before or tasted before!  It is a bit of a time consuming effort in some cases, but it is WORTH every minute.  It is not hard to follow the instructions for a perfect bit of art.  I thought I knew beef stew,  it all tastes the same every where, but not this exciting recipe with red wine and small little onions that I had never heard of before.  Magnificent!  I am retired and at least once a month I prepare something wonderful from this book and you can, too.  It is definitely worth it!

B000001ZS8|4.0|Jarre in the good ol'times. This album contains interesting experiments with sampling. That's one of the main aspects of JMJ, in each one of his old albums he experiments with something. One of his best albums, IMHO.
0307341577|4.0|SPOILER- Yes Patty Day, you were a horrible, horrible Mother.  Kansas circa 1985 seems like a terrible place to grow up, no thank you.<br /><br />This book was a fast and engrossing read.  Some parts did lull a bit and didn't contribute much to the plot, but I cared about the characters and had a couple feels while reading this.  I felt anger, sadness, and annoyance but never at the writing or the story just the characters.  Great read.
1400023343|2.0|To be fair, I didn't read it to the end. I stopped in the first chapters, because the book seems to be trying to sell itself in the sense that it keeps reminding how great and awesome is to have a child that speaks more than one language. Well, I knew of the advantages I was seeking for when I purchased the book, so I don't need to be sold that idea again... I was expecting to get the negative aspects and how to overcome them.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Okay, I have to admit I liked this book, but in a weird way. In the way of wanting to give it to my ex-husbands and say, &#34;so you think I'm a crazy bitch?&#34; It was very long, and sometimes repetitive with the first person narrative being switched back and forth between Amy and Nick. Or perhaps it only seems that way if you have been married and heard it all before. How many ways can you say you hate your spouse? I will read another of Flynn's books.
0312335164|3.0|It's a good book and I purchased it because it was the only one I haven't read from Dan Brown, at the time. As in other books from Dan Brown, the story is told in a multi-threaded way and it's almost impossible to find a place where you can safely stop reading without losing the track of the happenings. However, I was quite disappointed that the climax of the book, when the entire mystery is solved, it takes just a couple of paragraphs to explain what was going on. I went back and forth a couple times to make sure my book wasn't missing any pages, or if I didn't lose something important. But other than that, it's a good story and interesting how it's almost prophetical of the NSA scandals.

0201633612|5.0|Classic. Although the patterns are exposed in a cumbersome way (Head First Design Patterns is the best for that, hands down), the entire background on patterns and the detailed rationale behind each pattern still earns this book a 5-star.
0201485672|5.0|Excellent. This book is the best reference I ever had for my professional life as a software developer/tester. It has excellent advice based on years of practice with real software, not your classic textbook example. Once you get a few years under the belt, you find out that maintenance is where the software spends most of its life and this book contains valuable techniques to allow the software evolve and fulfill its mission, while avoiding common pitfalls that will undermine the quality of the software before it comes to an end.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|.<br /><br />Most of the bad reviews come from old people and critics like myself who are old enough to been around when Superman the movie came out. The only ones who are complaining are the ones who are nothing but familiar with Reeve's movies. It was a great movie back in the day. But things has changed a lot since then. Is a reboot, go to see it for what it is, a new superman for the new generation. If you expect Casablanca or Godfather material, keep walking, this is not for you. If you are a true Supes fan, if you had read Birthright, All star Superman and such, you are gonna love it. Don't expect him saving little kitties from a tree or stupid things we human can do for ourselves. He landed, he kicked butt and he conquered . And was freaking awesome...Did I say was freaking awesome?? 9/10 on my book....One more thing, I do feel like 143 minutes were not enough to cover Supe's mythology, that's my only complain, maybe an extra 20 to 30 minutes would had been better. Hope we'll get some an extra extended version on Bluray. Oh and you people that didn't like it because is not like previous version of him on the big screen, you know nothing about superman. Go and read Kingdom Come, Birthright, Red Son and you will have a better understanding of what was accomplished with this film. Wearing a t-shirt with a S emblem doesn't make you a fan.
B000005H63|4.0|Probably the best jazz-pianist I've ever heard. His technique is fantastic, his musicality is expressed through this album, as the other albums. A track like &#34;Brazillian Suite&#34; is beyond amazing.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|With this recording, Eno helped birth a new genre of music that opens up the mind; rather than invading a space, this music reveals it...the clarity of the remaster is a real treat.  The compositions sound as poignant and timely now as they did thirty-plus years ago, timeless elegance.  Great for reading, meditating, conversing, writing or intimacy...
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|At first I was disappointed in the first few chapters, but I stuck with it and I am so glad I did. I found it sad, touching, well written, intense, wondrous, and most of all unforgettable. Thank you, Mr King.ok
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I cannot think about better way to type on my mobile phone. It has also some cool features like learning algorithms, backup and cloud integration. It's worth every penny.
B00GJJXRKQ|3.0|I have until recently really enjoyed this show, but through this season thus far as well as Season 4 I have become more and more exhausted by it in a way I never have with a TV show. It is starting to become tedious and nonsensical. I see so many plot twists that have been blatantly stolen from other supernatural shows, and the storyline seems to recycle itself over and over. Three doppelgangers now?! Elena's constant and obvious swaying between love for Damon and Stefan. It seems every episode creates new questions for the audience, and not in a good way. There are pieces of information which are flat out left out as if the writers didn't bother to finish the script. The beginning of the season had my interest piqued. Now I am simply tired and bored.
1476734941|4.0|It was easy  to read and follow. It has good background information and explanations.  I just did not have the will power to follow through.

B008JFUS0U|5.0|This movie has the action and excitement of Star Wars and the epic grand scale of it, too. The movie is both humorous but also serious drama. It has a few points I could knit-pick but all in all it is a fun, thrilling ride, filled with little Norse myth references, amazing costumes and great performances by the whole cast. I wish Malekith had more screen time, so I hope there is a director's cut or at least lots of deleted scenes. I heard much of his stuff ended up on the cutting room floor. I've already seen this movie twice. The 3D isn't so amazing that it loses much in 2D however, it sounded so much better in the state-of-the-art digital Dolby surround at the theater where I'd seen the 3D version. The music is wonderful, too! I being Team Loki especially loved the piece called \\"Lokasenna\\" which plays eerily throughout the film and during end credits. Now I can't wait for Thor 3!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great,I love it. There are many characters to choose from but some you have to unlock by getting things for the mystery box... enjoy

0783232039|5.0|An amazing horror/comedy! The Bride of Chucky has been and will remain to be my favourite out of the Child Play series! What I had really enjoyed about this movie was that it had a little bit of everything in it including a horror story, a love story, a thriller/ adventure story as well as little comedic scenes in between to break the suspense of the film. The film begins when we are introduced to Chucky's Girlfriend from the past before he was killed, when she steals the dolls cut up remains from the previous film then stitches him up. We are then introduced to a second storyline when we meet Jade who sneaks out with her boyfriend Jesse who she is forbidden to see with consent from her obsessive Uncle (similarily to a Romeo and Juliet storyline). When we figure out that Chucky had never wanted to marry his gf Tiffany she locks him up in a playpen when Chucky gets out he transfers the soul of Tiffany into a doll and that's when the story really sets off. I would recommend this movie to any horror fans or in need of a great film :)

B0076DCT2G|5.0|As usual, Corey gets his man and keeps his woman. A good lesson for all.  Brilliant move by DeMille putting Corey and Brenner together.  Whatever DeMille has left to offer of John and/or Kate, I'm all in.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|because its fun to play, it keeps you interested in the game. the higher you go the harder it gets.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicted. In desperate need of a Candy Crush rehab!<br />Can't seem to put it down. I have it on all electronic devices.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is SOOOOOO fun you can't stop playing . The 6.99 part I would do the lite version first.<br /><br />Ps to mojang next update should  be enchanting stuff DO IT!!!!!!!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This charger is great, I liked both ports it works perfectly with my iPhone 5s, GS3 & even blackberry Z10. It's a fair price for a good quality product. It charges fast & the watts are perfect for each phone separately.  I highly recommend this product for the buyers.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Great I love it!!!! I wish I would have got it sooner,  just wish it had more choices. But great app.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|I am just joining the chorus of fans of this movie. Non stop action, realistic and well acted. Only thing bugged me. How the hell did the French let Mills and his daughter fly back to the US after he killed tons of people in Paris? Minor bug in an otherwise fantastic movie.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|She has such a beautiful voice.  I truly enjoyed hearing all her music again.  It was part of the soundtrack of my youth.  I am so sorry to know that she is no longer with us.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|classic movie. Had to buy it for my Grandaughter. She of course, loved it too. Great for all ages. A movie you like to watch more than once
030758836X|2.0|As other readers have mentioned in their reviews, I also skipped paragraphs (and sometimes pages) to move this story along. The writing was clumsy and often redundant. 'We GET IT already!', I kept saying to myself. I have no problem reading the portrait of a dysfunctional marriage. I love both The Taming of the Shrew and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Unfortunately, Ms Flynn is no Shakespeare or Albee. You need to be a writer of unparalleled skill to pull off that kind of intense dialogue. She misses the mark, and the first person narrative often overpowers the story itself. The author succumbed to the temptation to share with readers everything the character is thinking, inspiring the reader to skip much of it. Gone Girl is a perfect example of the tricks a weak writer will often employ in developing and executing a story. I'm sure it will be used as such in Creative Writing 101 classes everywhere.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Great Movie! But I have to say the reason I watch it over and over is because I love the house In it. If you BING &#34;something's got to give house&#34;, you will come up with tons of websites talking about and picturing the house in this film.
1451678193|5.0|The Martian Chronicles is a timeless classic that everybody needs to add to their collection so they can read and reread it.
B00168HARG|4.0|I can't believe this series didn't make it on TV, I really enjoyed it.  Love all the actors In the series.  Just great action-thriller science fiction.  What's not to like?
B008NIS2SS|5.0|Great deal on some great music! I'm not sure where else you can find so much fantastic music for such a low price!
147676459X|5.0|Absolutely funny and worth the wait! I've been a long time follower of Hyperbole and a Half and I am very pleased with all the new stories and artwork. Thank you! :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|awesome game that is difficult to put down. most people already know this game quite well. if you have not yet played it you need to download now and get your &quot;candy crack&quot; fix today.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|love the game but three words.  Cash.  Shop.  Sucks.  The ponies might cost like 95 gems and its hard to get that many unless you buy them.  The kindle game also needs the Equestria Girls update.  The game does have its flaws but all in all, good game.
B000IZAHB4|1.0|Wow! I can't believe I wasted 30 minutes of my life watching this dumb movie. My title above says it all. You've been warned.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We love it!  We got our friend into board games with this - she previously only thought she liked Carcassonne.  We have since fed her a steady diet of highly-visual and spatial games, so she now loves this, Ingenious, Ticket to Ride, a few word games, and the Discworld game.  Success!<br /><br />My one complaint is that it only plays well with 4.  There are modifications for 2 or 3 players, but they aren't great, and I don't recommend them.  I'm waiting for Blokus Trigon to go on sale, as that scales better, but it seems to be out of print.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a better starting game than Trigon, because it's even more visual.
B00FLDG5BE|3.0|I haven't seen it either yet, but it seems to be the same guys every time along with , I hate to admit,  some I have no idea who they are. There are however obvious non-appearances in my book by guys who have so much talent it makes me scratch my head everytime. Say the likes of Nils Lofgren, Mick Taylor, Neil Young, Santana, Mark Knopfler, Mike Campbell, Marty Stuart, Blackhawk, Dave Edmunds, Jim Messina,David Marks and Al Jardine and Steve Miller just to name a few. Maybe they have been asked but couldn't make it. But to never be there? Always glad to see, BB, Jimmie Vaughan, Sonny Landreth, Robert Cray , Albert Lee, Vince Gill, the Allmans , Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy and some of the others. But there's one young guy who is there time and again and I can't see what the fuss is all about. I won't say who. But to me he is a poser. Riding on the coat tails of true blues men. I hope, that if Eric does another get together, he can get some of the ones I mentioned. I am sure Eric holds them in high esteem. And they him.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Really is a good game love the puzzles it has pretty pictures just done the horses and posted on Facebook. They are so relaxing to me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. puts you on the edge of your seat makes you feel funny and is fun for the family
B00BWQW73E|4.0|The book provided great insight into Amazon and more importantly, the enigma that is Jeff Bezos. It was taut, well-edited and kept me hooked. Definitely recommend to folks who are fascinated by Bezos and his work ethic and his persona.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love doing puzzles and this is the best one I have found for free, and I will buy the extra ones when I do all of these.  I wish I could do them on the smallest setting but at 58 my eyes are not that good anymore.  Love them all.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game. It has many ways to earn coins and gems. This game keeps me entertain for hours.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun. I think it is better than temple run and minion rush. I like all the different characters. Perfect for whole family. No bad language no bad movement and nothing inappropriate. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000X2H8G4|1.0|I shouldn't have bought it.I wasted my money for nothing,the company shouldn't say anything good for this product.I threw to the garbage the first day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on kindle been waiting seems like forever. Everything I hoped for. Big and beautiful. Perfect!!! Runs great. Can't ask for more
B0026RHR6K|3.0|Cylon figurine is awesome! I imagine this is how my brother felt 20+ years ago when he'd get a new ninja turtle. With that said, the picture quality also reminds me of those good ol' days when we had to adjust the tv antennae to watch them turtles on Saturday mornings. Needless to say my husband and I quickly reverted to watching BG again on Netflix. Kind of disappointing considering how much we paid for this bad boy. Oh well. I still love BG with all my heart!
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Like I said in the previous review .... I've purchased everything they've released. I have a 5 disk CD changer. During the holiday season this will occupy one of those slots for quite a while.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So excited Candy Crush was finally available on my Kindle!  The game can be frustrating but over all fun!<br /><br />!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|A modern masterpiece by a writer who is interested in the world around her and is interested in commenting on and illuminating the dark spaces she investigates. Shriver's ability to project herself totaltt into a range of characters, and empathize completely with a a range of complex and dark emotions is quite something to behold. Shrver never once stabs any of her character sin the back, she treats them all with honour and respect, even when they are dark and monstrous. She's rare talent and a writer who one day might truly justify the clam of being &#34;great&#34;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love it, best game ever! People who didn't buy this SHOULD! I love how you can do survival or creative! BUY THIS GAME!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love love love it. Works better than I expected. Picture quality is even much better than any computer or small screen device.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I love this game! But it took a long time to load. :-( That's why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. Bye now.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is so entertaining.  It's addicting in a great way.. If you're stuck waiting for an appointment or just trying to relax this is a wonderful past time .
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Iron man 3 the game is just plain BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS .I was so close To getting The War Machine MarkII .
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Gotta love Lion King.  It's hard to find a copy of this movie anywhere so I was happy to see it on Amazon.com for sale.  If you've never seen the movie, it's great not only for kids, but for adults too.  You won't be sorry.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoy playing bingo blitz, it's very addictive.  The only thing I don't like is the constant clicking of won bingos, very annoying.
B0037VNX44|5.0|The film was an amazing piece of art, if you can view some movies this way then it's worth seeing. Its kind of dark and sometimes slow and depressing, but when the view of his demons he fights are indulges in start taking place it becomes very entertaining and original. The music or sound in this film blends the art and violence into a great underground film.
B00E9A656K|5.0|I got this game about 2 years ago. I started playing and it was awesome! I downloaded it on all my devices. thanks
B001PB3NWK|5.0|It is a very good biography of the Holy father. The only sad thing, the first part of the movie is not available... I cannot find it.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I like humorous books (story's) .<br /><br />I like the rest of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series.<br /><br />I would recommend this story or series of Diary of a Wimpy Kid.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Good game for in the deer stand or if you are just bored. Lots of fun, and its free!!!!<br /><br />Good game for kids too!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Good tool, would be great if there will be more apps for using the Chromecast. I like to watch Youtube via the Chromecast
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|Stryper has been one of my favorite bands for a very long time and they are still on top of their game. No More Hell to Pay is an excellent album from start to finish. There are no filler songs here and I believe Stryper has found a new drive after 30 years as a band- they have a passion to spread the Word in a unique way. I hope this album does very well for Stryper so they can continue their message- my 9 year old daughter is a fan as she will sing \\"Marching Into Battle\\"... a new generation of fans will hopefully enjoy Stryper's music for years to come. God bless...
1609611543|5.0|I am at a healthy weight and it was not a struggle to get there.  I have more energy and my high blood pressure is in check (I am now taking half what I was and am hopeful that at my next doctor visit, as my bp is still low, it could be eliminated.  Wheat IS a culprit!  It was very easy to adapt this healthy way of eating.
B00902AKK4|5.0|I really like this app it's very fun and time consuming it also makes you have to think because it is very strategic
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Basically Monsters Inc. 2, although the title does not say so because this is a PREQUEL to the Monsters Inc. movie.  It tells the story of Sully and Mike Wasowski's journey through their college years, how they met and how they got to where they are &#34;today&#34;.  I didn't expect much from this movie, and was pleasantly surprised by its humor.  Great movie for kids, there are monsters in it, so if your kid is sensitive just watch it with them. My son was 2 when we saw it in the theaters, he got a bit freaked out by the Dean of the university, but he didn't get nightmares. So, beware but enjoy and have fun!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It's a rarity, I know, nearly impossible even. But there was a mistake at the printers with my copy of this book. You see some pages from a completely different story, got accidentaly inserted randomly into Allegiant. So the story I read was incomplete, with some stuff that wasn't even part of the story. It was a printing issue. Very uncommon. Oh, wait, I read an ebook. Well then it's digital. Anything can happen in the digital world. Really, it happened. It's the only explanation.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|About a team of magicians attempting to pull off their largest trick ever.  I LOVED this movie, it has a unique storyline with great actors and actress.  Filled with plot twists, and leaves you at the edge of your seat in a good way.  Great flick to watch with your man or woman-- and that's hard to find!  I rarely watch movies twice, but I've seen this one more than once!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown always makes you think about the world beyond what we see. Thanks for the exciting read and the thoughts.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|How can you not love Pixar's animated classic 'Cars'? Cars is a movie about a race car who wants to win races, make it big, and who gets sidetracked for just long enough for him to realize what is most important in life.  This movie teaches children the value of friendships over materialism, and it encourages children to look past &#34;shiny exteriors&#34;. True character and self worth are inherent. My son loves this movie, it ranks amongst his favorites alongside Monsters Inc., UP, and Wall-E.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I have read most, if not all, of the &#34;Heavy Hitting&#34; Science Fiction Military books.<br />Now add carefree wit and humor which makes the story's characters come alive and<br />I promise you this story is worth your time. I strongly recommend the other books; Ghost Brigade and Zoe's tales.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|The pure fact that it took years to animate this movie and to develop the storyline and soundtrack for a mostly dialogue free movie is enough to gain it 5 stars. But, it also provides a challenge to our modern age of glut and excess.  When we value our ease and comfort over the needs of the world and environment, we risk running into the same traps as the people in this movie.  Wall-E is a lovable robot who heroically attempts to save a tiny plant, and ultimately the fate of our planet. His efforts are valiant, and even though he cannot talk, he communicates love, compassion and a drive that most of us non-robots do not have. Every time I watch it, I am encouraged to exercise more, and to care for this lovely world a bit more. I think that is the point they were trying to make. To the producers, writers, artists, etc of this film--well done!
630542845X|2.0|bought for a friend she remembered it from her childhood. told me she loved  the movie still does love it
B0089LOG02|5.0|Wonderfully woven. Enjoyed this book and will encourage my daughters to read it.  My Grandma told stories of this hard times of the Great Depression.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I got this as the free app of the day and was a little skeptical....after playing several levels....I was hooked AND stumped....then my five year old grandson got me unstuck and we carried on...between the two of us we are having a blast....Great game fun graphics...no ads...love it.kindle fire HD
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got this app because my Grandson keeps talking about what level he is on and how fun it is  I am really having fun and it is a great challenge  I recommend it for all ages.  Even old ladies
B00003JRCQ|5.0|While I have enjoyed most film versions of Jane Austen classics during the past 20 years, this telling of Persuasion is among those rare cinematic gems that is  perfectly cast and brilliantly acted.
0684857219|5.0|It was just what I needed! The encyclopedia has helped me understand in detail what it takes to become a bodybuilder.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game but can you make a online version of this?Would be the best game Gameloft created that's all I ask
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a way to wirelessly stream netflix / other websites and this works great. It even allows you to stream one tab (netflix) while using another tab to continue browsing the internet. At $35, this is a must have!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Really fun game but how do you play multiplayer?<br />Because I wanna play with my friends<br />Totally worth 5$ though
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best app I have ever played and I have only had It for 5 minutes.I love this game so much
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|I love this games like I love the first one a must play for everyone who loves games tower defense rpg games
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's a good app,challenging I like that you can choose the level !!! Red, black, green and ; do what the other one is
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|I've known about Joss' friends coming over and &#34;doing&#34; Shakespeare for many years; alas that I was not one of the lucky ones who got to participate.  I'm delighted he decided to take the step of actually filming one of them.  This is probably the best version of Much Ado (sorry, Mr. Branaugh) I've ever seen.  Sean Maher steps out of the heroic spotlight to play a villain, and does it so magnificently you wonder why he didn't turn villain long ago.  Amy Acker's Beatrice is the best I've seen in this play (honestly!).  Everyone does a terrific job, but one must mention Nathan Fillion's Dogberry.  My husband and I howled, both in the theatre with the rest of the crowd, and at home watching the Blu-ray.<br /><br />The black-and-white filming was a great decision by Joss, and you can see his handiwork throughout the play.  Bloody brilliant.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game now on kindlefire. Very challenging and addicting. Learn to mix specialty candies to get bigger better effects. Long game for hours and probably months to get through!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I had to undo this Google Search App when my virus alarm on my Kindle was set off after the download.  It said the App had a poor history.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|I already bought the individual season sets, but as a Columbo scholar and super-fan, I couldn't resist the extra-special Black Friday sale price, so I bought this set as back-up. This review will compare the releases.<br /><br />Got it today! The main advantage over the previous releases, I think, is that the collection has been packaged to be very compact -- about 5 inches of shelf space for all 69 episodes. I thought they might use those super-thin boxes, but instead they just re-sized the original design to put more discs into each box. And they packed the \\"ABC series\\" into only 2 boxes, instead of stretching them out over 4.<br /><br />Another advantage is that there are NO \\"double-sided\\" disks. In the original releases, at least one season (I forget which) had the error-prone, 2-sided disks. So that's been fixed.<br /><br />One way they slightly slimmed each box, was to eliminate the booklets -- instead, the episode names, and brief descriptions, are printed on the inner surfaces of each box. This has the downside that you might have to pop-out a disc to read the episode list and notes.<br /><br />Speaking of episode lists, one improvement I would have liked to see (other than better Extras!) would be to print the episode names ON each disk, so you can see what titles they include when they're away from the box. But no, as before, the discs are only identified as, for example, \\"Season 2 - Disc 3\\".<br /><br />Extras are the 3 \\"Mrs Columbo\\" episodes previously added, and a TV special called \\"Top Cops\\" about the classic, mainly 1970s-era TV cop characters, including you-know-who (although if I recall correctly, their shot of his \\"ID card\\" is bogus, taken from an illustration created for the back of the paperback novels).<br /><br />Anyway, for the price it can't be beat! A great choice to own and enjoy one of the best TV series of all time.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|WOW!  Very gripping, very believable and very well done.  Someone had a great imagination that I came to realize, is right on the money.  It IS who we are and want to be.  Quite an eye-opener.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini gets better with every book, if that is possible.  Masterful storytelling, gripping characters. Wonderful choice for all ages -- middle readers through adult.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|No, it's NOT Bonnie & Clyde in the Future.  These kids have heart and are actually trying to make things right.  There was not a thing about it I didn't like, nor was there a thing about it I couldn't buy into.  Just a very clever and well done, Futuristic movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|okay, this has got to be one of my fave games ever. I heard about it last<br />year ,played it , and then it was one of the reasons I got a kindle. epic game
B004P02OJ6|2.0|What a stupid plot, what a stupid movie and shame on Russell Crowe for taking the part.  He must have needed the money.
B00GB7GX20|5.0|Celine is amazing at everything she does. She is my favorite artist and has been for many years. Long live Celine!
B003G4W49C|3.0|The book lacked tension the pace was even throughout the. I can't write anything else with out revealing how the book plays out.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|The second season wasn't as good as the first, I'll admit. But it is still one of my favorite shows.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|again thisisa great toy and the deliver service for this is outstanding i will be order for christmas and future birthdays
B00BWQW73E|5.0|An amazing story. I will forever think a bit more deeply about what happens when I place an order on Amazon.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|my son love this it came so fast and were perfect for his birthday you guys are so fast in getting the order out great job
B002QP145C|3.0|The movie didn't show the ski patrols and how they ambushed the Russians to maintain their territories. I did love the spirit that was put into the movie to show Finnish &#34;sisu&#34; and the sacrifices they endured.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|These are the very best! I love the extra length. They are made by Amazon for the Kindle s, and it works between the different types of Kindle also. There is no need to buy multiple cords for Fire AND Paper White, etc. and get confused. Choose this one for your power cord. You won't be disappointed. ONCE AGAIN: the extra length really comes in handy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this app, I use it constantly.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It's easy to see, easy to use, and has some nice features.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a cool game and I play it every day<br />  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I feel like I'm taking care of a real horse
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|I could tell from the trailer this movie was probably not for me, but I was curious about the computer generated stuff. Obviously some wild effects, but sadly they all too quickly become boring.  A strong leading character such as Bruce Willis could have brought a little humor to this thing and made it at least watchable.  The scientists are portrayed as absolute buffoons (even though they are the ultimately salvation of the planet) and the 20 something tough guys spend most of their time swaggering around trying to speak with a lower than natural voice ( they actually turn out to be the laughable ones ). Sadly the effects seem more convincing than the writing and acting. If you think punching stuff is key to life, this movie is for you.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I've recommended this book to dozens of friends and family and they all give it a huge thumbs up.  I'm so grateful to Adam's family and fellow Navy Seals for their willingness to tell his story.  It is a special one!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A fast fun read but boy did Grisham stretch reality.  He had too many holes I the plot which were just sloppy. Grisham, you can do better.  All in all it was a fun diversion but not a book you will think about or share.
B00A7UD6ZY|5.0|I have a Blueberry Farm and this is great to wear while I'm harvesting my berries. It's very comfortable and the quality of the music is fantastic. Charges fast and lasts me all day long. I get almost 50 ft range which is handy around the farm.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast is exactly what it was promised to be and works perfect. Easily and fast set up it works perfect with all the supported apps on my Android. Chrome on a laptop streams to the Dongle perfectly as well.<br />Only the implementation of YouTube in Chrombrowser isn't working for me (at the moment in the UK) yet, but since I can cast every Chrometab it's not really a problem.<br />I'm looking forward to many many more apps that support Chromecast i.e. Vimeo, VLC, Spotify, ... and when that happens especially if you don't have smart TV the dongle is worth 10 stars
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad that you brought Candy Crush back!!! I love this game. It works great on my kindle fire.
006202406X|5.0|The majority of people that are reading are the angry ones that dislike it because they don't like the ending but they need to understand that Veronica Roth gets to chose what happens so get over it!!! It was an amazing book and I'm giving it 5 stars because of all the low ratings
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Best cd l've heard ln a long time!l've never heard the song Red Suited Super Man before, but l love it! How about a Volume 2!
B000IDJNJ8|5.0|My bumper sticker reads BASIC INSTINCT THE BEST THRILLER EVER MADE.  Sharon Stone rightfully so became famous because of this masterpiece, she was that amazing in it and beautiful to boot!  Michael Douglas was incredible also; he is consistently an amazing actor and this is no exception!  Catherine and Nick had great chemistry together and the lesbian lover twist was great; also the woman who played the part was hot.  Even the older \\"friend\\" who you are to assume was another of Catherine's strange lovers was effective.  When I heard there was a sequel I was psyched.  With the right script it could have been unbelievable; but instead of keeping the mystery going it was a tired script and although Stone still looked killer nothing about the sequel was mysterious..besides the missing intrigue the chemistry between Sharon and the dull dude she was involved with was sleeping pill material.  DON'T MISS THIS ORIGINAL FILM THOUGH..NOBODY SHOULD GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT SEEING BASIC INSTINCT; IT IS THAT GREAT!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Couldn't get into this book at all.  Didn't even finish it.  Very disappointed.  thought that since it was from JK, that it would be awesome.  It was not.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I got this as a free download and as a free app it's 5 stars. Don't know if I'd feel the same paying for it.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This was such a fun read. Unique premise and clever writing. I wish this went on longer but it wraps up nicely and takes you to some interesting places.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As good a Grisham gets!  I would have bet on a different ending, and was pleasantly surprised when that didn't happen!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Creative! A great read that kept me guessing all the way through.  This is my favorite of the three Gillian Flynn novels I have read.
B002VECLVO|4.0|Always a good movie to watch, sad, yet beautifully acted.  The emotional journey of a man mourning the lost of his lover, remembers the memories, and through an understand student in his class, gives up the idea of suicide.  Acting superb - music score, minimal, but haunting.
B00DSO9RMC|5.0|I have read and listened to all of the Disc World books and enjoyed them. Raising Steam contains many references to characters from previous books, but I do not think you would need to read the previous books to enjoy this novel. I have just finished listening to this book and I am ready to listen to it for a second time.
B002RI9XOW|4.0|So did I love this book more before or after the movie?  Well I had read this book and had really enjoyed it several years before the movie came out, but once I had seen the movie I could identify with the lead character a lot more (unlike in [[ASIN:1573227331 About a Boy]] ).<br /><br />In my opinion this novel started a trend for modern romances that it was cool for blokes to read, and for novels that blokes want their girlfriends and wives to read to give them an insight into the complex meanderings of the male mind in love.  A trend continued not only by Hornby in his newer books but also by contemporary authors like Matt Dunn and Mike Gayle, as well as newer writers like Andrew Culture (whose recent book [[ASIN:B00GKPLHHO Getting it]] bears more than a little sympathy with the lead character in High Fidelity).<br /><br />It cheers me to see that the popularity of this book has never really wained in the (nearly) twenty years since it was first published.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|&#34;Fearless&#34; is an absolutely incredible book that provides a look into the personal life and struggles of an American Warrior.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book started a little slow for me.  I didn't like Amy or Nick all that much.  Then it grabbed me & I couldn't put the book down!  I really liked the way the chapters volleyed back & forth from Nick &<br /> Amy' perspective.  I love the authors sense of humor & writing style.  I added several new words to my vocabulary, thank goodness for the Kindle dictionary feature.  Overall a great read-highly recommend!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I absolutely ADORE my Chromecast. As with all Google Products, you simply plug it in and it goes; first time, everytime.<br />Set-up takes seconds. Thereafter, it really is as quick & simple as clicking on the Cast icon, (that appears across all your devices in Aps with the coding) on the same wireless network. There is no additional fuss or installation required.<br />The simplicity of the Chromecast really can't be overstated.<br />My technophobic other-half who hates everything new and reserves special venom for 'stupid nerd toys', began casting in seconds, loves it and is now rarely ever off it. Indeed, I'm being pressured to get a second Chromecast for the bedroom.<br />The sooner Ap developers get on board with with Chromecast; the better. It is undoubtedly the future. One Google innovation that isn't likely to go the way of the IG Homepage.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I'm not a fan of the large face watches that seem so popular these days. This Seiko is just the right size and has a great classic retro military look. The green face color is not a bright green, kind of a military vehicle green. The watch feels like a quality timepiece but I have to admit some disappointment that the movement is made in Malaysia; this a Seiko....Malaysian movements? All in all, a cool casual watch.
B00425S1H8|3.0|Purchase to use it with a Allen Bradley PLC and it did not work. A Thinkpad T430S  did not recognize the driver.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these three books and had a hard time putting them down to do anything else.  I lost lots of sleep because of staying up so late to read them.  Highly recommend.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great app.  Good job of interfacing with weather app.  Nice to have weather and alarm clock on screen together with music feature.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I'm 40yrs old, used to show horses as a young girl and love this game. It's more than a way to pass the time, it really is an enjoyable game to play. I highly recommend it for all.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|Golf is a game I have much fun  playing. I find my self playing for hours ! I  LIKE THE WORLD TOUR  the best
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I think it is a cheap trick to get you to pay money to get more moves!! To have to wait 24 hours to be able to play this game, stinks.
B006FPFTMS|5.0|i love this app. i feel that its better than adobe reader...... :p. on kindle it is very user friendly and i could highlight with any colour highlighters and i could even write annotations. its brilliant for reading n taking down important notes on journal articles! xxx &lt;3
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I found the book to be a gentle story of love that overcame many obstacles . I read it twice and enjoyed it more the second time around.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|i read somewhere that this app is able to annotation and highlight..but im not able to. im really disappointed.its no difference from the adobe reader before my recent update. :(
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The season that started everything for Walt. I suggest you watch this if you are into action, and drama. What a great show.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great Movie and the 1080p quality and 3D effects are awesome.  Hopefully you have a panny plasma and not that LED fake high quality TV stuff.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Gotta love it, if you are a fan. This just takes off where the first season left off. All, just leading to that inevitable end for Walt. Of course not having see the last part yet, I am not certain what that will be, but, I am guessing he will do a long stretch in the local slammer. Not a spoiler, just a guess.
0671015206|5.0|Lots of great information presented in a digestible fashion.  Good stuff.  Should be required reading for a lot of people.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Things heat up in this season,and so much has developed. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but well worth every penny you invest into this show.
B00650SSDU|4.0|Because I saw it in the theaters and liked it so much, I bought the DVD for my collection. It has the laughs and it happens in the real world.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Dexter is just one of those shows that get's better with time. This is a wonderful season with a lot of plot twists and surprises.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|Ugh. I adored the first two Bridget books, but this feels like an intern wrote a follow up, not the original great voice. A depressing let down...
B003L16FAE|5.0|First copy would not play in dvd player, this is my second copy, this one played fine. This is the movie that started it all with the Predator franchise.Great movie, great acting, great story. Lot's of blood, gore and action.<br /><br />Ralph
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that this app is on kindle. It is a lot bigger screen to play on.  Good thing you only have 5 tries or I would never put this down :-)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Gripping.  A great read could not put it down.  I finished it in a weekend. I'm ready to read more.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A captivating story told from Death's perspective. A story of defiant courage on the part of those caught in a hopeless situation.  Great read.
081099741X|3.0|It was alright. Matt Seitz seemed to know more about Wes's films than Wes did.<br />It had some nice pictures, most just screen shots and Wes seemed disinterested.  Just my opinion.<br />The box was way to big and the book had the slightest warp.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|THIS BOOK HAS SAVED MY LIFE MANY TIMES. I GOT SICK MANY YEARS AGO FROM A PATIENT WHEN I WAS A DENTAL ASSISTANT AND I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING ( INCLUDING MY HEALTH) THAT I WORK SO HARD FOR  FOR MANY MANY YEARS. WHEN I GET DOWN I RE READ THIS BOOK AND START BACK UP DOING WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING ALL THE TIME AND IT NEVER FAILS ME.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Bridget Jones has been off the radar for many years now, because the last novel ended with a Happily Ever After.<br /><br />However, time has passed, life doesn't generally grant us HEA's, and Jonesy is again neck-deep in the complications of life, including dealing with two v. young children. Some fans may be ticked off that (spoiler alert) the author did not allow Bridget and Mark Darcy to live to a ripe old age as a married couple. But if she had, this book would not exist, and I ENJOYED this book tremendously, found it believable, poignant in more than a few places, and laugh-out-loud hilarious in others,<br /><br />The humor is still stellar and entirely relatable. Here's one of Bridget's (and my own) resolutions: &#34;Deal with emails immediately and so that email becomes effective means of communication instead of terrifying Unexploded Email in-box full of guilt trips and undetonated time-vampire bombs.&#34; Yes, well, something about good intentions, hell...<br /><br />Social Media distracts her from what she SHOULD be working on: &#34;...Is absolutely imperative not to tweet today, but finish screenplay. Have just got to do the ending. Oh, and the middle lot. And sort out the start.&#34;<br /><br />Regarding online dating, Bridget's friend Tom uses this catchy metaphor for a potential partner with whom he is flirting: &#34;All text and no trousers.&#34;  Then there was the twunken (drunken Tweeting) bird fiasco...<br /><br />Bridget's mental digressions are delicious: &#34;he picked me up in his arms, as if I was light as a feather, which I am not, unless it was a very heavy feather, maybe from a giant prehistoric dinosaur-type bird...&#34;<br /><br />It works as a stand-alone even if you haven't read the previous novels. If you have, it offers a peek at the glory of Mark and Bridget's past married life. It offers all the delights of mummyhood including lice infestations, vomiting, and cuddling in bed at storytime. I'm mad about this book.
B00062PN6I|3.0|Sound quality is like what you would expect from headphones this price however the cord is so thin I expect it to break anyday now.  Seriously thin like dental floss!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great app it is very informative and useful to use. I really like to use the clock and weather information. The screen brightens and dims with the swipe of your fingers
B00FPH3YQA|5.0|Awesome movie, just as good as all the others, I am glad they brought all characters back for the third movie!
0316322407|5.0|The book sheds light on world history through an individual's story.  I would recommend that high school juniors and seniors read this as part of their history course of study.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is brilliant and smartly written. Truly lovely, touching, and am glad to have read it. This is the first time I've ever wondered about an author and his background. This book is so poetically written that the author is genius or has a similar story of his own.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Throw your life away and live for candy I say!  Forget all you hold dear when chocolate does appear.  Life is a merry dream as you savor whipped cream.
B00DH4BL8Q|4.0|I like books about the mythology. The Series are written from a young reader's  view with humor and love and loyalty between friends..<br />The Gods show character portrayals humans can understand.<br />The demi gods  have the problems of each teenager but they learn to master their problems.<br />I hope the series and films learn the teens to read .
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|Amazing!  All hail the might Metal Gods!  Judas Priest never disappoints.  I hate that this is their final world tour.  They shall live on in my heart forever!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This product doesn't do much other than play netflix and YouTube on my tv... To bad my tv and receiver already do this. Thought I'd be able to mirror everything from my iPad, at the very least I was hoping to mirror safari and movies on my iPad... Skip this and get the Apple TV.
B0011U5E1S|5.0|This is the band that got me through my angst-ridden teenage years. What more can I say, except All Hail, the Grunge Kings.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This album is probably one of Eminem's best in years, the lyrics are put together masterfully by Em, and the musical ensembles that Rick Rubin and Dr. Dre put together are on point!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A Christmas Carol is by far one of my favorite Dickens ghost stories. We often think of it as a heart-warming holiday tale, especially given the constant barrage of variations on the story. What many of them forget to include, however, is that the transformation only happens during moments of terror on the part of old Mr. Scrooge.<br /><br />Classic lines that made the tale a masterpiece are often forgotten in these retellings, and I feel it is important to go back and read the story to be reminded of its genius.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Worth it for free :) it's really over all fun. Woot woot. You won't be upset like the other apps
B00FWLTPU8|4.0|Fun. Fast paced movie. really enjoyed it once. Not sure I'd watch it again but one time is good. Fun
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|I read the WWOZ for the first time last week. I'm 49 and I never missed watching the movie every fall growing up. I will say on this rare occasion that the movie was better than the book. The cavaet being that I've seen the movie about 50 times (and it is a classic) before ever reading the book. The book is quite different from the movie. This surprised me. However, I did enjoy it and would recommend to any reader of any age.
B00FPH51LQ|1.0|I really wanted to like it but it's so bad I can't finish watching it. It's just too bad to watch.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|Immaculately restored. &#34;Nillson sings Newman&#34; is amazing. The packaging was not the best and tracks r listed in<br />accompanying booklet, not on covers. Overall a winner 4 the price!
B000AS4L16|5.0|Though the topic is hard and it is over 9 hours, it is well worth it. We watch it on Tisha B'av and really do get so much. The director was able to create situations where you can see how things were and are. The people he interviews are not even aware when they are saying things the should not.
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|Gary is really authentic, totally to the point and right on the money. I loved what he had to say about leaving a legacy. Gary thank you for this gift.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I gave this a four star rating,<br /><br />This story pulled me in and kept me guessing the whole ride.<br />I would recommend this story to anyone who is not afraid to look into themselves and other human beings.<br />Lessons are here to learn, enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a wonderful game and I would recommend it to everyone who loves a challenge. It is interesting and mind challenging.
0761172726|5.0|Please calendar to have for families to keep all your activities and schedules on the same page.  I get this calendar every year!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I love this game . I just wont to now if y'all make more levels . This a great game to play with.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use this app for myself, for my little one's naptime, just a great application. New sounds are being uploaded constantly. I only wish they would have an open to automatically alphabetize new sounds that you download. But even with that small complaint this is still a great app. Highly recommended.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Still trying to figure out exactly what this book was all about, which is part of why I liked it so much.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|We'd seen Papilion before and wanted to put it in our DVD collection.  It's quite a story plus being a piece of history.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|The tv app for kindle  is very disappointing. The channels are almost all religious. There is also a heavy download chance if you use 4g. Stay away from this. Now I  have to figure out how to remove it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It was fine for awhile, THEN I got this message to update it from Amazon, but the update is only for Kindle Fire HD which I don't have.And they didn't specify.  So, now I can't use it all! I tried to put it back on (the old version) but they won't let me. Very aggravating. I'm glad I have an ipod touch also.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is Lots of fun and very addictive!  One of my favorite pastimes!  I would recommend this game to everyone!
0451419243|5.0|This book and the one in the series before it simply pull the reader into caring about the characters.  The plot is extremely powerful and impactful while the reader knows that it is based on real life events.  I can't wait for the next one.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|it is an awesome app. if you love editing pictures then get out of the reviews and install it already!
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I really like this watch. It has a more standard size case and looks very nice. Looks great when I wear black.
0385537131|4.0|I am looking forward to reading another good Grisham novel.  I am disappointed in the condition of the book when I received it.  I purchased a food waste disposer at the same time and both items were shipped in the same box with no protection for the book.  The top corners of the pages are wrinkled and look messy.  I take a lot of pride in my books and am not happy with the lack of protection for this one during shipping.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is a fantastic book and as hard as it is to believe the concepts and practical steps detailed in The Power of Habit can eliminate back pain (and many other chronic conditions as well), because our bodies can develop a habit to feel pain.<br /><br />Once I learned that my back and neck pain, pain and numbness in my hands, arms, and legs were simply a habit my body had developed and identified the cues, realized the routines, and the rewards involved I was able to manipulate the routines and change to a more exciting reward to recover rapidly and completely from chronic pain and disability. My story of recovery is explained in Rapid Recovery from Back and Neck Pain: A Nine-Step Recovery Plan.<br /><br />I learned many of the concepts in this book in my college psychology class. It totally changed my outlook on life. I saw all my beliefs and behaviors as sets of habits and set out to change them for the better. I replaced negative thought patterns and beliefs with empowering positive ones, bad habits with good ones.<br /><br />What I love about this book was case studies of how good habits had helped individuals and organizations succeed by making small keystone changes, whether it was a football team or a large company.<br /><br />The point this books makes about will power is also quite illuminating. That will power is in fact a muscle: the more you work it the stronger it gets. Although the author does not discuss will power when he explains how Phelps's daily routine has helped him win so many gold medals, those routines also help build his will power and self-discipline. Self-discipline and will power in other areas of life affect many other areas, including rapid recovery from chronic pain.<br /><br />I would give this book a 10 if I could. It is a book that one has to read several times to really internalize its many lessons.<br /><br />By the way, in my recent book, Rapid Recovery from Enlarged Prostate Symptoms I explain how the same concepts and steps can help a man rapidly recover from enlarged prostate symptoms as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing and full of action. Katniss is back an  I  Better  than ever. This book still has the story line but makes many perfect twists an  turns.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Very good book. I love the twists and the description and the inner thought of katniss it is truly amazing.
B0067LY4WG|4.0|These are sad, sweet songs for the elderly by the greatest song-master of our time. Maybe not as great as some of Cohen's earlier works, but deep and resonant to the heart.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Happy with it and I really don't know what else to say if I didn't like something then you would hear
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited that this is finally available for my kindle fire HD. Able to feed my candy addiction easier LOL
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Happy with it and I really don't know what else to say if I didn't like something then you would hear
B000BKXA9C|5.0|One of my favorite Neil Young albums. I compare it to Harvest. Great to finally have a vinyl copy. Sounds great. My first copy had one side out of round big time. Had to return it. Kinda disappointed with what was to be a audiophile pressing. Returned it. Amazon was out. So hoping to get a new copy soon.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Happy with it and I really don't know what else to say if I didn't like something then you would hear
B008VSEJPK|5.0|Essential for serious home-recording mixers, complete, funny, Mike Senior is a gifted teacher, with a holistic musical vision. I Think this is the best book of his kind, so far!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Happy with it and I really don't know what else to say if I didn't like something then you would hear
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|great app. lots of fun! took a little time to get used to it but I'm addicted now. very easy once you start and cant put it dowm
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|It's a pretty cool game but the whole running out of energy kinda games that make you either have to wait or pay cash irk me
B00CPTUN5G|3.0|As the father of a 7 year old daughter who loves My Little Pony, I decided to preview this film before she watched it because the whole \\"Hey, let's turn My Little Pony into another Monster High/Winx clone\\" concept gave me pause.  And I'm glad I did, because this movie was NOT written for little girls (have people forgotten who the MLP target audience was supposed to be?).  It's for bronies and pegasisters.<br /><br />I very generously gave this movie three stars, and only because admittedly the tunes are catchy, and if you're an adult that happens to be into this show, you'll enjoy it.  I can't knock you: I was into Digimon in my early 20s.  But we've been trying very hard to teach our daughter the values and importance of being a strong woman in a society that still largely treats women as second class citizens; that she can do or be anything she wants, not restricted by what others think she should be.  Which is why we loved My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.  This movie, on the other hand, just stresses the importance of being popular in high school (which is easily overlooked because of the \\"have lots of friends too\\" message).<br /><br />To summarize (SPOILER ALERT): Twilight's crown gets stolen by another pony.  Twilight enters alternate dimension and goes to high school.  In the most convoluted plot point ever, Twilight enters popularity contest so she can win her crown back.  Twilight wins popularity contest by getting all the school factions together, teaches popular girl the importance of friendship by becoming the popular girl with the most friends.<br /><br />I'm not even going to get into the begging-for-a-panty-flash miniskirted, anorexic character designs.  God forbid even Rainbow Dash or Applejack would wear something sensible for sports or farmwork like, oh, pants.  And am I the only one that noticed the only characters that didn't fit the tall and scrawny body type were Sunset Shimmer's henchmen?
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|Heard a song from them and fell in love. So glad I bought this Cd. Was also surprised that this was a TWO Cd set!!! YAY!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Was unaware of train riders and the insignificant way orphans were regarded and tossed about. Not finding suitable families.  More like sending them off as slaves. Not to homes that wanted children to love
B005F6NA56|4.0|This artist has really turned me on to French inspired music. It's slow, beautiful, and breathtaking. I had puchased one of her other CDs and loved it, so I had to buy the others.
B000GOUMPI|5.0|It's a classic. And, although it doesn't follow true to the book, I love watching this movie. IMHO, this is Nicholson's best movie.
B00005J6T1|5.0|Thank the CD was in really, really great condition, thank you thank you!!!!!! I will recamend  you to my friends
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|LOVED this movie. Tons of action, kept you guessing, lots of interesting backstory and the main story woven in a brilliant way.  Four magicians with different talents are brought together to perform mega-shows that involve getting real cash to audience members.  The story involves two investigators, one doing it for the FBI and one doing it for the money (professional &#34;how they did it&#34; videos) and keeps you holding your breath until the end. And the next part of the end. And the last part of the end. Awesome plot, great acting, pulled me into the story and kept me there to the credits.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|Thank you so much for this DVD it will always be a classic to me and my fends, Thank you again!
147676459X|5.0|Allie is fabulous! There's enough new material in the book that it's worth double the price! I just wish I'd gone to the book store and had her autograph a copy.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Absolutely hated the ending!!!!! Great writer but I enjoy some good old fashioned resolution. With a different ending I might have ventured to read her other stuff..
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I'm surprised any movie could live up to the hype this one had, but in my view, if not 43% of the critics, Man of Steel did it. Critics are complaining for the exact reason I love it. Unlike lighter toned, past films, this story was pretty serious almost from beginning to end, realistically reacting to grave dangers on both Krypton and Earth. It also takes a more realistic (PG13) approach to the death and destruction caused when opposing, massively powered Kryptonians wage war among us puny humans. Mankind is completely powerless in the epic scale of this threat and only Superman stands between us and annihilation. I'm guessing about 45 minutes of the movie was filled with action and apparently that was too much for some critics. Considering the quality of the origin story and the lead up, it felt appropriate to me. $250 million buys some of the best special effects I've seen, a perfect cast, and the best soundtrack (Hans Zimmer) I've heard in decades, but the story and directing always come first. Well, Zack Snyder finally made a great movie, setting a new bar for a more serious genera of superhero movies which I don't see being topped anytime soon. 10 out of 10, movie of the year and my new favorite superhero movie of all time.
B0042816YK|5.0|I enjoy Julia Roberts and all her films. I am still looking for the one she made in Mongolia with the horses. I will buy it if it ever comes out.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|My daughters are avid readers of Harry Potter and many, many others.  This series had not disappointed.  They both love the series.  I would highly recommend them.  Very similar to greek mythology, not my personal favorite topic but you could find far worse for you pre-teen and early teen children to read!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Very good. I follow British films quite a bit because I love to watch the details in arquitecture, costumes, and all the details. This is an excellent story witha lot of unexpected events.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I was hoping to stream videos other than Netflix, Hulu, ect.  I would like to be able to stream pictures and home videos.
B005FISC52|5.0|What is not to love - my teenagers and I loved this show!  It completes the series.<br />We  had to have it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very addicting--- you come back time after time. sometimes I think the game &quot;lets&quot; u win just to keep u coming back
B00E9A656K|4.0|If you wanna refill your car's fuel in seconds go to date n time settings and increase the time or date then open game your fuel will be refilled again<br /><br />Hack by Udit Lunawat
B00GD9F59S|3.0|I LOVE this series. The romance scenes are hot and there's generally a good amount of action. I also love the Origin series but that's a different story. At first I was not a fan because as many others have mentioned, it's extremely similar to Vampire Academy. This is the 5th and final *tear* book to this series and I enjoyed everything..but the ending.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /> I hate that Alex dies..and then her mortal life is actually over. The demigod thing was extremely unexpected but there are way too many things left unsaid. Can they have children? Is Seth happy? Are her and Seth still connected? Does Seth ever find true love? How is Marcus? There was no epilogue and that drives me crazy..but it also leads me to believe that JA might be writing a spin off..hopefully about Seth. That would be amazing. I just felt like the ending didn't give me the closure I needed. Seth was one of my favorite characters & in the end he makes a huge sacrifice..and then...that's it. Does Seth get his happy ending? We will never know...unless my suspicions are correct & there will be a spin off series about Seth..which would make me explode with joy.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was good enough to keep me interested but nothing spectacular. It's a good beach vacation read and pretty easy to follow
B00785P2QC|4.0|Decent game, not to bad graphics. Good game to pass the time. If u looking to just build a city in your spare time this game would be good for us
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|My son loves this movie. I think it is really well done, and a funny story that adults can watch too
B00992CF6W|5.0|For all  the people asking about the updates... minecraft updates itself, Amazon is usually a little late on the updates so if you have a iPod, iPhone, iPad, etc.. and you don't have it on your kindle it is because of Amazon's late update releases.
B005OP28XS|5.0|My wife and I got hooked on this show and had to get all the seasons to catch up. Very funny.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|There needs to be more movies like this one.  I saw it a couple of times on Hallmark and knew I would enjoy watching it on a DVD many times again.  I only wish there had been a sequel made of this.  Katie and Marc had such great chemistry.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|This is a great album by a great artist. I think that Amazon should let you rate albums without writing a review.
B005HSL626|5.0|I thought that it is fun. It has some pazaz to it. I think that the makers of the app deserve a big pat on the back you no.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I like this movie. They could have cut out about an hour of it, and it would have been better.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great book! I am on my second time through, picking up on all the little but later important things I missed the first time through
B0011Z77OK|4.0|This is a great album by a great artist. I think that Amazon should let you rate albums without writing a review.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was a great book, albeit a little sad. Miss Roth, don't listen to the hater comments! I hope you write more!<br />I loved this book, EXCEPT for this:<br />Tris died at the end. I wanted her to be with Tobias until the end! *sobs dramatically* She died saving her brother, and was a hero until the end!<br />EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK
B000TERI3O|4.0|This is a great album by a great artist. I think that Amazon should let you rate albums without writing a review.
B00984668E|1.0|Dude, are you serious? This band is good, but do you know how disappointed I was when I opened the shrinkwrap and noticed the promotional mark on the UPC code(the UPC was actually covered by Amazon's tag before I opened it)? Right, it is on a cheap price, but I do have the right to know if it's promotional or not!
B0049IWQJW|5.0|This is my sons favorite Pixar movie. It's a great story and my son loves watching them on Amazon. I like it too
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Could not put this down. Important Thought provoking story. I am sure a film version is in the near future.
B00030DEQE|4.0|Not much to say about NIC cards except they always seem to work. I think if you have a NIC card instead of using the onboard network connection, you can get slightly better performance. At least that's what the forums say. I bought this because I was having problems with my onboard network connection and needed a cheap, easy alternative. Intel does a great job with NICs.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Great product!  I only had one 3.0 USB plug on my laptop, now I have four at a very reasonable price!
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|One f the best movies I've ever seen.  Both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon were absolutely flawless in their performances.  It is apt that Michael Douglas won every award possible for his portrayal of Liberace, yet I wish Matt Damon could have been equally rewarded since he never gives anything but his best in every performance, but especially this one.  I was expecting a great film, and my expectations were surpassed.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Excellent App. I can carry my device around my house and check Wi-Fi strength fast and easy. I recommend this app. and would get it again.
B00D3V85FA|4.0|This is a great album by a great artist. I think that the music today should still sound like this.
0307730697|5.0|This is a book that draws you in so quickly that you will want to read it all in one sitting. Adam had a hard life, but managed to overcome the challenges and become one of the best of the best in the Navy SEAL community. My brother knew Adam and described him as \\"one of the most moral men that I know.\\" Reading this book gave me real examples of what a great man Adam was in life and in work. He faced adversity at every bend in life and just powered through each one. I recommend that everyone read this book. I think it could be especially powerful for young men facing challenges; it is an inspiration.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|It is fun, great graphics, easy to play, but you still have to think and pay attention.  Fun for kids and adults alike.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is the game that you would want to play no matter what. That is all I have to say about it
B008B3F38C|4.0|Not quite as catchy as &#34;April Rain&#34;, this album is still worth a purchase.  Songs like &#34;Electricity&#34; and &#34;Are You Done With Me&#34; demonstrate the great hooks we are used to from this band.  Recommended.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Excellent App, easy to use, accurate. I use it every time I re charge. I recommend the free version and would get again.
B00307OTDE|5.0|This is a great album by a great artist. I think that Amazon should let you rate albums without writing a review.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The author draws you in to this incredible journey of hardship and resilience ,of internal fortitude of a young orphan girl .  Beautifully written!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this is an amazing love story told in an unbelievable way. the love these two have for each other in such a short time is above you could only hope to be in your whole entire life. amazing.
B001E9641K|3.0|I love the TTR games, and thought this would be a well balanced version for two or three players.  I played it with friends for awhile and we all felt like it was not optimally balanced, especially compared with the US 1910 expansion.  Still a fun game, but not as good as other TTR offerings in my opinion.
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|Gregory Porter is a double threat in the world of jazz. A wonderful singer, with a natural honeyed baritone and great expressiveness and a top notch songwriter. His songs catapult him to the top of the jazz world. At once reminiscent of Bill Withers and Les McCann, but with their own beauty and thoughtfullness. This CD has some top notch material-- and the wonderful support of his band. This guy is going places!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Geat App, which is easy to use, accurate, easy to access. I highly recommend this app and would get it again.
B0011Z32PS|5.0|This is a great album by a great artist. I think that Amazon should let you rate albums without writing a review.
B00DJWV11I|1.0|I fell for the high number of reviews and the high number of 5/4 stars. There is nothing good about the hero. Let me quote him so you can decide for yourself....<br />- Very low respect for women:<br />\\"It's The Bitch. Otherwise known as my sister, Alexandra.\\". Scroll down on the same page, it also says \\"Drew?\\" she says softly. I feel her hand run gentlythrough the back of my hair. \\"Honey?\\" Her voice is so achingly worried, she reminds me of my mother.\\"<br /><br />- 'She is saying no, but she really is saying yes' kind of psycho reasoning for all his behavior:<br />She holds up her hand. \\"Engaged.\\"<br />Undeterred, I take her hand and kiss her knuckle. See, I'm not the type who really listens to what people say.<br />Doe Eyes may be telling me no...but her body? Her body's screaming, Yes, yes, f** me on the bar. In the span of three minutes, she's told me why she's here, what she does for a living, and allowed me to fondle her hand. Those are not the actions of a woman who is not interested.<br /><br />- The thing women don't understand is that a guy can want one woman and still f*** another one. Hell, a guy could love a woman and still f*** ten others. It's just the way it is. Maybe you'll understand my point of view if I put it this way. You brush your teeth, right? Well,<br />suppose your favorite toothpaste is Aquafresh. But the store is out. All they have is Colgate. What are you going to do? You're going to use the Colgate, right? when all is said and done, you use what you have to keep those pearly whites clean. See my way of thinking? Good.<br /><br />- Writing style is also fake first person/your best buddy narrative:<br />  Like I said, I am typically an observant man. Sherlock Holmes and I, we could hang out. But I'm so enraptured by the view of that sweet ass, I miss it at first. Did you notice? Did you catch the little detail that passed me by? That's right. She called me \\"Mr. Evans\\".<br /><br />I rest my case!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|works as stated. big display of the time, and loud enough to wake to. recommend this to anyone that is looking for an alarm clock for the kindle.
B00004CY5R|1.0|It was not made to fit a US DVD player. I specifically ordered it from the states..and so can even watch it.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|What can I say but wow! Jennifer Armentrout knocked it out of the park with the final installment of the Covenant series. Alex has been one of the best heroines of any book series that I have read. You root for her from the beginnning of book 1 and feel invested in her story.<br /><br />Alex is rattled at the beginning of this book after her fight with Ares and not sure if she can be the god killer Apollyon everyone needs her to be. She is remarkably tough and brave and isn't afraid of making hard decisions. She is a true fighter all the way to the end.<br /><br />I have to say the ending surprised me quite a bit. It wasn't what I expected but actually couldn't have been better. I think Jennifer Armentrout found a way to make everyone happy which is hard to do for an author with such devout readers!<br /><br />Aidan was his normal swoon worthy self. He couldn't possibly love Alex more and would do anything to protect her. The scenes between Aidan and Alex were electric and I read a few of them over and over again.<br /><br />I felt like this book was a redemption story for Seth. I actually loved his character and was angry at him in the past two books. It was nice to see that everything Alex felt for Seth wasn't a lie.<br /><br />The killer about these books is the action. It never stops. It is hard to take a rest while reading this series and Sentinel didn't hold back.<br /><br />I have to say that I am hoping Jennifer Armentrout's acknowledgements at the end that includes this, &#34;This may be it for Alex, but you know....stories never really, truly end,&#34; is a hint at more to come from this world!<br /><br />Reviewed by Candace for Cocktails and Books
1416595554|5.0|This is a very well-researched fast and engrossing read.  The language is simple.  Great &#34;escapist&#34; reading.  Enjoyed the book enough to order another book by Simon Sebag Montefiore.  &#34;Sashenka&#34; is the only novel he's written.  He's a historian by background.
B0061US58C|4.0|Good movie that my son loves. Not as good as the original for adults, but the kids are entertained by it.
1250038820|5.0|I  have been following this photographer on Facebook. I lived in NYC for a few years when I was in the Coast Guard, and have a fond place in my heart for the people of NY. The book is great.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this app is amazing! I wish more dresses were open but this app is great... I would reccomend this app
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Got stuck on one of them and ended up at YouTube for help lol. I'm hooked now. Must download the rest.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|The game's author continued to ask me to review this app which made me feel like a Pawn in his marketing scheme.  I consulted my Bishop for advise and he told me last Knight to stop acting like a Queen and rate the app.  Since the app was free, I don't feel Rooked at all by rating the game.  I must say that since I have completed the review of the app, I feel like a King.  Hey, it's a chess app. You move, your opponent moves, etc.  Works great and when playing the AE, it let's me win more often than not.
B000JMKO0A|5.0|I hesitated to read the book because it was about a prostitute and I don't like to read depressing books but this book was truly about finding pure love...it's a great story.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like it, I don't love it. It currently only has Netflix and Hulu for watching videos. If Amazon Video gets on board, I'll be set.
0385373791|5.0|Excellent!  As good as Hunger Games!!  This review is from my 11yr old son who hasn't stopped reading them four a week.
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|I'm not generally one to like &#34;gadgets&#34;, but this worked terrific. I was teaching a course and my old wifi pen died. I was a little leary of document cameras as the ones I've used in the past--including expensive ones--did NOT work well or high enough resolution. Anyway, I ordered this via Amazon prime, it came in on time, and I literally used it for the first time in front of a live class--worked terrific, great resolution, autofocus, etc., and the strudents loved it too! (As with most cameras, putting it on really high resolutions slows the frame rate down, but for writing on paper to show a class it is a very good new addition to my &#34;bag of tools&#34;.)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Google Chromecast Streams YouTube and Netflix flawlessly! Easy setup. Even a caveman can do it.  I can't wait until they add more services.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|Does what is suppose to do.  If it had a distortion control for higher volume it would be 5 stars.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|love this game thanks guys keep it up will recommend to everyone I know ive always loved playing hunting games.
B0042GIRYE|5.0|This is a great album by a great artist. I think that Amazon should let you rate albums without writing a review.
030726999X|4.0|I liked the whole series - taut, crisp, well-written, fabulous characters.You really should read the entire series to get the whole picture.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! I am on level 500 and still going!! It never gets old and the angel wings jet pack is my favorite!
B001F6TXME|5.0|While looking for a remote that was more dependable than my Nikon wireless remote I decided to stay with OEM equipment. This simple remote device works well without any problems.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I like monkeys, (don't really know why), and I enjoy watching boxing so the perfect app for me.  Simple and fun to play.  A great time killer without having to build you skills or spend your money buying power ups.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row has all the ups and downs of a great legal thriller and pushes you to finish the book, holding onto every word, waiting to see the next twist in the plot.<br /><br />The revisit of Jake Brigance and Clanton, Mississippi was like visiting a place that you have fond memories. Four stars to John Grisham who is arguably one of the best storytellers of our time!
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|This is a very funny movie if you can get over the fact that Ted sound just like Peter from Family Guy.
0486284735|5.0|This is a classic and a must for any serious reader.  It embodies the flavor, style, historical setting that appeals to anyone, but especially to Anglophiles.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I've been looking for something like this since Microsoft stopped adding Cardfile to Windows. This is the place for all of that sticky note information you don't want to lose track of. I love that I can get to it on my phone, Kindle Fire, or any computer I use.
B00EK0UBPU|4.0|This novel is an interesting insight to the early west coast. This is a long novel although it did not seem so. It has an interesting writing style with an intro to each chapter. Its an ok read but nothing too gripping
B0076DELIG|4.0|As usual Harry gets the job done-his way.  For a fast paced read this series never disappoints.  Except...I thought I knew all about Harry and now I see I have missed a few episodes - when did his daughter appear?  I will see if I can find a list of Michael Connelly books in order and catch up.
B00447L4JG|5.0|Wife and daughter wanted this movie. Arrived on time, packaged good so it wasn't damaged and was exactly as described. Everybody is happy, happy, happy.
B003M6WERG|5.0|My wife and I got hooked on this show and had to buy all the seasons to catch up. It funny
030745455X|5.0|Important to read all three of Larsson's series.  This one is excellent to start it off.  Fascinating characters, so real you could feel them in your presence.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I'm amazed how many times a month I use this ap. I don't know how I got along without it.
B00E6X4GAW|5.0|Religion is the the source of all evil on earth. Its a pity we don't all have the common sense understanding and tolerance as this brave lady.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|,This game is ok but sucks when u don't pass a leval so that  ok but it dose help with kids charisma and strategy so it dose help.with that and also it might cause total mad Ness so if you get this game I recommend not letting kid under the age right play because of anger destress and also rather do that our get a electronic that j<br />Kid can throw at the wall and also get a wall that throw proof
B00AEFZ2DG|5.0|a great film of action with such fine job of acting by all involved, enjoyed the action with the river scene and desert with the glider
B0049J3RBC|5.0|One of the best that Pixar has put out. My son loves all there movies, and loves to watch them on Amazon.
0307454541|5.0|This is a must in the trilogy of Stieg Larsson.  Anyone who enjoyed the other Larsson books will enjoy this one.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|Great movie, love watching this every year during the Halloween season. Had it on VHS, then dvd and now on Blu-Ray.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game can be challenging at times and other times not so challenging. Would recommend to any one<br />who's likes this type of challenge. waiting for new rooms.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|As I remembered it in on the big screen. A great addition to my collection! a piece of history you shouldn't pass up!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was one who was highly anticipating the release of this book. That being said, I was also pretty disappointed once I started to read it. Unlike the other books, I felt this one started rather slowly and didn't pick up until quite a ways through the book. I almost felt that Roth was trying to do too much. Instead of focusing on one or two philosophical questions,  I felt she tried to deal with one too many issues.<br /><br />However, I could have put up with all of that if the ending had been different. I absolutely HATED the ending. I was in complete and utter shock because I couldn't believe she actually did the one thing I felt she she would not do. In other words, this is not a book that ends happily.<br /><br />Overall, it was extremely well written as per Roth\\"s usual and I appreciate how she deals with tough issues that are normally absent from young adult fiction. I just wish it had ended differently!
B001XUY818|4.0|It's not on par with GoodFellas or Casino, but it is a very solid movie to kill an afternoon. Good acting.
0374158460|1.0|Didn't care for ANY of the characters.  A depressing story of life in America today.I didn't understand why this book was so highly recommended.  Goes to show it's all a matter of taste.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|Great thriller!!!!!!! Enjoyed it and so did my husband. Fabulous!!!!!!! Great casting. Wish I'd seen it sooner. Will watch it again
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very good book - complete resolution with a wonderful message.<br />Wanted to read the book before seeing the movie - glad I did.
B00ANAC32U|3.0|Lasted for a while till the bottom broke. Just super glued it. Now its usable but kind of ugly. Oh well.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|I learned from the first Castleville to save my crowns, but accidentally used all 40 to do a action that would have taken 5 minutes.... if there was a confirmation for use of crowns I would play otherwise I probably would not.
B0049J5EWW|5.0|It's the first and may it may be the best of all the Pixar movies, After 15 years it holds up very well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is quite challenging at times but still very fun.  hope for more rooms soon.  the last room is pretty tough.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone, any age, anytime. I'm a 50+ year old grandmother and I couldn't put any of this series down until I was finished. Thank you Rick Riordan for an entertaining experience!
1933865474|5.0|This is a great book! If you are a fan of Bruce Timm you won't be disappointed in this one!
0765334798|5.0|One of my favorite Scalzi books so far. It's an homage to Star Trek and something entirely unique at the same time.
B00E9PXI3S|1.0|Brian de Palma couldnt direct a porn movie so he destroyed a French film instead. Good luck getting past the bad casting, the self indulgent &#34;homage' winking directing and the non-sensical plot. What a piece of merde.... watch the original &#34;love crime&#34; for free on amazon instead.
B00445YMME|5.0|My wife an I got hooked on this show and had to catch up on all the seasons. Very funny
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Loved it! After the seventh season, I was worried that season eight might be a little 'slow', but not at all!! Season eight was great! Can't wait for the next!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|enjoy playing with my eight year old. good time passer. it does tend to lock up/slow down every few games.
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|This was the best-written, and acted, vampire movie we have seen in a long while. The story line was captivating and thought-provoking, the characters were very well developed, and the variation on the usual vampire lore was refreshing and intriguing rather than hokey and childishly romantic. It was great Saturday night entertainment on an intellectual level.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent, stick it to the man kind of book....nothing short of amazing!<br />Can only hope they don't alter the story to much in the movie!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book has been the most amazing and positive book I have ever read. I really enjoy every word, and I'm certain positive to recommend to everyone I know. Great book.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|This is a great album by a great artist. I think that Amazon should let you rate albums without writing a review.
B00EI4V3X2|5.0|Absolutely TOP OF THE LINE quality headphones (for gaming anyways). I Bought these to replace a set of Tritton 720's (wired) that I used for \\"last-gen\\" gaming on 360 and PS3 (those in turn replaced an older set of MLG Astro's). The sound quality is right on par with the NEW Astro A40's (which was my other headset choice) but these are about $100 less. The PX4's have absolutely gorgeous bass levels, full and rich with ZERO sound distortion. The Mic quality is excellent as well and fully-detachable.<br /><br />  Best of all though (surpassing both previously mentioned headsets), is the comfort level of the actual headphones. The ear-pads themselves are thick and contoured, they are beyond comfortable (even if you have bigger ears) and everything about the design is perfect. There is nothing about the headset itself that feels \\"cheap,\\" The weight of the headset is PERFECT, any lighter and it would feel uber-cheap / any heavier and you wouldn't want to play a 3-hour session of Battlefield 4 with all the neck strain you'd be fighting off.<br /><br />  The two aforementioned headsets suffer from a really blocky and plasticky design with too many squared angles that I personally find to be an eyesore. These are the exact opposite, sleek and rounded and actually EASY to adjust! I couldn't recommend these more to anyone who is both a gaming enthusiast and audiophile as well, you WILL NOT be disappointed!<br /><br />  The only slight negatives about the headset are, yes, the instructions. It's almost guaranteed that you will have to go on Turtle Beach's Website to find out what the audio settings are (of which there are five of to select from). I also found the included Optical (TOSLINK) cable to be pretty cheap, so I swapped it out.<br /><br />  ** Make sure you charge these up before you start up your Playstation 4 on 11/15!! At launch THIS is the ONLY fully compatible headset, all others including the PS3's PULSE ELITE - REQUIRE the Firmware Update to use. A full charge for me took about 2 hours and the charge holds just about over 15 hours of gaming time on it. The included USB-Charging cable is a good 8 feet long, so you can still charge while you play as well. The Headset also has volume control for both game audio and MIC audio, so you can drop out chatting-audio when playing online with a bunch of trolls.<br /><br />  If you're on the fence, don't be! Just buy them! Once you get them out of the box and set up (using the website) you'll feel fully justified in your purchase!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game, but hate that you have to purchase items. But overall, a great game that challenge you on every level....
0071766588|5.0|It is very good book, explains all the answers and the difference between the choices. I also it shows a very smart way to select the answer. It was shipped quickly to my house. I also loved the CD because it has the exact setting for the test. so you can really get a good use of it. thanks a lot
B006ZWLXZ8|4.0|LOVE the album greatly but the packaging itself was low quality. I first though the sticker on the record was peeling off but once it came off more there was actually another sticker below it. The record sleeve is on the cheap side but the album music is great.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lots of fun.  One of those games you keep going back for more - to say nothing of how colorful it is..  I like bright shiny things - I'm prteey sure I used to be a raccoon. :)
B00000IZOR|1.0|This toy is very boring for my 1 year old.  The cord between the handheld part and phone is only about 6 inches long so there is no way you can get it to your ear. I do understand the safety of choking but then they should just not make such a toy.  He didn't play with it at all.  And the rotary dial moves way to fast so its no fun to pretend to dial.
140006922X|4.0|Great book....but would like footnotes instead of all the notes at the end....it would have been easier to follow with footnotes
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love it but it would be better if you could walk have a free mode but I prefer gangster Vegas it's the best game gameloft has made.
0071624058|5.0|fast shipping good quality and great study tool for TOEFL International test. the cd was very helpful useful.<br />used like new.
B00A4EDAN6|5.0|Love this album and I love it even more being on vinyl. So happy to have this in my collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely amazing book! I read it in 2 days then immediately read the next two!!! I highly recommend this book to anyone :)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Loads of fun !  Highly suggest anyone get this game.  Keeps you coming back to play over and over again.
B003Y393HQ|4.0|These sandals are comfortable. they run a little wide but stay on well because of the straps. Great for walking vacations.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|It's obvious that Elton put an extra amount of time into this album.  I've been a fan of his since a very young age and I find myself not getting tired of this one at all.  Any person with an ounce of good musical taste won't be disappointed in this album.  Also, Elton sounds great for being 66 years old and his playing seems to have an added touch of passion to it..
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|stronger than I was !  Bad Guy ! Headlights which is the stan part 2 . EMINEM is back the rap god is back!!! Expect the tour!!!
B0097BTSSS|5.0|LOVE this album and I'm so happy to add this to my vinyl collection. Can't complain about a single thing.
B00CR1DX9A|5.0|A fun story with gags scattered throughout. The characters are extreme as the title suggests but it really works well as a fun light read. I noticed a couple of typos but nothing to get upset about. Well worth a read.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I absolutely love this game. The little jokes are very entertaining. I laugh out loud whenever I get to the Vampire's &quot;date&quot; with the princess
B003G4W49C|5.0|I actually hate sci-fi  books,  but this book was amazing! So great! I have to keep reading them now to see what happens!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|when friends send extra moves it's a waste of time because those extra moves don't work on iPhone or Android devices.  extra lives that friends send are only available for a day,  if that and then they disappear.  this app deserves major improvements.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Looking forward to getting started and feeling better.  If it works for me, I plan to share it with friends.
B00AFARIZA|4.0|We read a sterling review of this and were inspired to order it.  The music is wonderful, really wonderful, with a full repertoire of masterpieces and some not so well known.  Multiple discs and hours of beautiful music. The only problem, alluded to in the review we read, is that these are re-recordings of original performances so the quality is not as clear and resonant as cds of recordings of concerts now.  We have enjoyed it over and over.
B008JFUN6E|4.0|Neil Blomkamp's second feature film, Elysium, is not as good as District 9, his prodigious 2009 feature film debut. That first Blomkamp movie was a miracle film - brilliant in its vision and as emotionally powerful and gripping as the greatest Dystopian science fiction film of all time - Bladerunner.<br /><br />Even if Elysium does not measure up well with the high standards of its classic predecessor,this is hardly a reason not to see Blomkamp's unique vision of the future take on a wider scale. We continue to witness a young director map out his unique vision on a much larger canvas. His talent for creating new worlds and invoking a mood to match the scale, is all well worth seeing again.<br /><br />Elysium is a fable of a world gone horribly wrong. Social ills have reached a terrifying level of mismanagement and neglect in the year 2154. The divide between the rich and poor has become massive and unbridgeable. The vast differences have set the privileged few to abandon their planet and flee from the languishing poor to create a wealthy, secluded, spotless off-world space colony in orbit far above and away from the social chaos of the withering world they have left behind.<br /><br />The off-world enclave for the rich, aptly named \\"Elysium\\", is built to be a paradise of tranquility and its spotless world is much like the afterlife wished for and imagined by the ancient Greeks. This is a world replete with comfort and security with technological toys catered to keep the physical and mental well-being of Elysium's creators - the elite rich - in perfect condition, free of pain, death and disease. Every home has a miracle machine programmed to heal the human body at any stage of deterioration. There is a settled peace on Elysium with crime non-existent, the life of leisure constant, and the inhabitants humming in perfect health.<br /><br />But the surface ease and tranquility of its inhabitants barely hides the systematic hatred and exclusion they have encouraged. The contrast of this world of brightness, clean air, perfect health, and safety with a world plunged in disease and turmoil on earth below is a telling one. This setting of contrasts, so much a part of the aesthetic of District 9 reaches a bigger scale here in Elysium and magnifies the sense of rebellion in the dying world below.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Max, one of the abandoned poor who longs to escape his plight on earth. Max, like many others, pines for Elysium; as a child, he has looked up longingly to this world of dreams. He has learned to talk of it as if it was the afterlife, after a trying existence on earth. But the defense of this glistening abode of the rich is callously overseen by Delacourt, well played by Jodie Foster in an uncharacteristically villainous turn as the secretary of defense at Elysium. Max works as an assembly line worker in a factory that manufactures and sends out robots as a first line of defense against the likes of him. After Max is forced to confront his own mortality his sole aim becomes to plan a rebel invasion to tap into the vast medical resources of Elysium. The cure for his rapidly failing health becomes his driving ambition. But Delacourt tries to put a stop to this. She does this with brutal and unthinking efficiency. Sharlto Copley, Director Neil Blomkamp's lead star in District 9, as Kruger, in another great performance, is the one man demolition squad for Delacourt. As her foot-soldier who will stop at nothing to carry out her orders, Kruger does his bit to resist the efforts of Max and his team of rebels.<br /><br />Elysium proves that Matt Damon's success as an action star, since the Bourne series, is no fluke. He continues to show that he can do the action star bit convincingly. Damon is getting better at his craft and he has that unique quality to convincingly take on the role of an ordinary guy who takes on an extraordinary role when he is forced to lead.<br /><br />Blomkamp revives themes from District 9 - the rich against the poor, the marginalized world of slums set against the world of the privileged, that drives the apocalyptic theme envisioned here. The drama of the desperation of the poor foregrounded here is a reminder of the world imagined in District 9. This story sets up a similar need of a Herculean Christ-like figure, reviled and marginalized through most of the narrative. This is precisely a world that demands heroes and the story and characters are set up to answer this need.<br /><br />But the emotional weight disappears gradually and the story of love and sacrifice lapses into melodrama. The directorial choices made here do not map out well and characters brimming with potential are drowned by the scale of the spectacle (the special effects are as awe inspiring as any sci-fi film this year). The human dimension of the story rapidly evaporates and the script veers gradually into cliche. The tragic sense that lay at the heart of the art of Blomkamp's District 9 is diluted as the plot gains momentum. As we reach the denouement, the director seems to let the tragic tension that he so artfully engaged with in his first film languish in some crucial moments.<br /><br />As a science fiction, action film, Elysium is great entertainment but only if you come in determined to forget that this is directed by that prodigy who created District 9. But if you see Elysium for what it is - an action film and a great Friday night at the movies - with reliable performances from Damon, Copley, and an inspired supporting cast, and as a wonderful journey to another meticulously crafted world by Blomkamp, this is a spectacle you will not want to miss. This is another science fiction film worth embracing despite its flaws. As such it belongs to that category of films with set-pieces and production values that are nothing short of astonishing  - like Oblivion and Prometheus - but with stories that lose steam precisely at those  moments we expected so much more from its distinguished directors.h against the poor, the marginalized world of slums set against the world of the privileged, that drives the apocalyptic theme envisioned here.

006114665X|2.0|1. This book aims to cash in on the centenary of the Sarajevo assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which bothered no one at the time and was welcomed in Vienna and Berlin  as a casus belli. Christopher Clark page 11 refers to \\"murderous passions now directed to undermining Austria-Hungary\\", an impossibility. Empires, the saying goes, die by suicide, not murder. A-H was an occupying power in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a Serb land with Croat and Muslim minorities, and the conspirators were from all three of these communities. Their goal was by no means the destruction of the immense Austro-Hungarian Empire, but to expel an occupying power and unify all Yugoslav peoples in their own state, just as the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland aimed for Britain's withdrawal from occupied Ireland, not to annihilate the British Empire.<br />2. page 11: Lieutenant (later Colonel) Dragutin Dimitrijevic, according to this and other authors who do not read primary sources, was \\"... known as `Apis' because his heavy build reminded his admirers of the broad-shouldered bull-god of ancient Egypt...\\" Christopher Clark probably took this from the Encyclopaedia Britannica, not from any primary source. The man was not exceptionally big. Apis is not the Egyptian word for a bull, but the name given to Osiris in the appearance of a calf. Dimitrijevic was dubbed by his secondary school mates for his unremitting work habit; he was the \\"busy bee, Apis mellifica 'honey bee'. Apis is not Egyptian, but Latin.

B0002V7O3S|4.0|I liked the film except for the fact that it had to be returned as it was defective.  I have yet to ordder another copy.
1250012570|4.0|It was recommended by a trusted friend, but I did not love it like she did. Good though. Reading another book of hers right now. I'm hopeful.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Used to watched the series on TV awhile back just as good now nice to watch again without commercials.  Some episodes i remember but still a surprise or two.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|The game starts out very frustrating. It is very difficult to figure out what your supposed to do. Using the hints, map, and note book are very helpful. Make sure you remember where the scenes are located. You will need this to find items and where to place them in the scenes. It is like a scavenger hunt. Great fun worth every penny. Can't until the next one.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is amazing app<br />Really good<br />It is one of the best apps I have<br /><br />Every one has this app in my family

B003O86FMW|5.0|If you thought the Hunger Games couldn't get any more exiting.... you were wrong. In the sequel to the Hunger Games, Catching Fire makes you get caught up in the action too. After what happened in last year's games, Katniss and Peeta are in hot water with the Capitol. They have caused rebellions and unrest throughout the districts. Katniss quickly finds that she is the leader of the movement against the Capitol, and she has to find a way to make it work. President Snow is \\"out to get\\" them, when the 75th Hunger Games, the Quarter Quell, rolls around. Katniss and Peeta are once again force to put on the star-crossed lovers act like they did before. They and many other victors are forced into the arena again, and they have to figure out a way to get out.<br />Author Suzanne Collins perfects the story with the right amount of action, suspense, and drama. Normally, a second book in a series is just a place filler, but she knows exactly how to keep you on the edge of your seat and keep the pages turning. The action keeps you from putting down the book until you are completely finished, and even then it will make you read it over again. I would recommend this book to anybody that likes suspenseful action type books. The book is great and I would encourage you to read all of the books in the series.
0545615402|5.0|I have owned these book since they first came out. I bought this set for my nephew who is currently reading the Harry Potter series. I can't wai tot give them to him for Christmas.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of these types of games, but this one has a lot to offer. If the company decided to create more games on this theme, I would definitely try them out.

B00CATSONE|2.0|I think this book could have done with a little more Tesla and a little less of the surronding &#34;self-help&#34; text on genius and imagination (particularly since the fact that Tesla died practically penniless would be a bit of a hindrance to it's intended message).
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Allies Brosh is amazingly good at describing how a chronically, severely depressed person's mind works against them. And somehow she makes it hilarious.

B00BBYZ14E|5.0|I liked the original thought and development of the duality of the human mind, one moral, one immoral. Interesting, if scary, concept.
B00EKHE1JA|3.0|Ok figure. Articulation leaves much to be desired, but the size, weight, and the detailing makes up for it. The leg of mine snapped off with out much pressure. A little glue and the figure stood nicely on display. NOT for play. Joints get pretty loose...
1594202273|5.0|gave as a gift and it is being thoroughly enjoyed by a retired US Marine friend of mine. Eric Schlosser is an author who gets all facts and can provide the truth about anything he investigates. You may remember him from Fast Food Nation. He is an author ahead of his time. Suddenly we see the FDA attempting to remove trans fat from our diets as Schlosser said in 2006 and much earlier.

B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This show has an interesting story line and characters.  I have watched the first two seasons and was glad to see it on Amazon prime!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A very interesting and easy reading book. You are taken in by the innocence and the crueltry of a harsh era in Ireland. The characters are so believable as they weave in and out of present and past and take the reader on a beautiful adventure through their lives. I found this book to be highly entertaining and couldn't wait to enter the journey the author so cleverly took me on.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game, very creative but need more levels, if I was designing the game there would be posters of girls in bikinis on  the wall and blood splatter on the floor for ,no reason, WaHaHaHa!
B00EH486AQ|4.0|Nice detailing. The swords are a little flimsy and lacking of articulation but still a nice piece to display. Good size and build.
0385350864|5.0|This book was purchased as a gift and I have never had any problems ordering anything from Amazon. This is  my go<br />To store for everything.
B00G32OER4|2.0|The product being churned out by the film industry continues to degenerate. It's getting discouraging.&#60;---Make that sentence past tense, come to think of it.<br /><br />Yet another gazillion bucks (relatively speaking) are spent to assemble a team of capable actors, set designers and effects artists, etc. More millions are spent crafting a trailer that truly does intrigue viewers (not as easy a thing to do as many people might believe), a massive ad-campaign is launched and, finally, upon release, most of us who still possess the ability to think in linear terms discover that no one bothered to hire writers with the talent needed to craft an entire and compelling film narrative. SPOILERS AHEAD. Let's get to the film.<br /><br />There's no reason this could not have been a gripping movie, given the money spent and the team of actors involved. A few original ideas and some deft plotting could have turned this up several notches. As it is, we have a textbook derivative &#34;story&#34; (supposedly &#34;based on true events&#34; -- which is the first reason to roll one's eyes, whenever Hollywood says that, these days) and a few clever ideas thrown randomly into the proceedings. A large family moves into a farmhouse and discovers it to be haunted. They are perplexed. Meanwhile, a couple of ghost-hunters &#34;with a past&#34; are drawn into the mix. One of the most STUPID atrocities committed right off the bat is that the Lady Ghost-Hunter (Huntress?) reveals to the audience the exact nature of the haunting in its entirety. A cackling old witch related to someone involved with the Salem witch scandals used to own the property and hung herself from a tree in the front yard after sacrificing her baby and has threatened to punish anyone who gets involved with her land thereafter. Well, thank you very much! Aside from that being a completely moronic back-story (see below), why tell the audience all of this before the movie gets hopping? Why not keep it a mystery to add anelement of suspense for the viewer, and trust me, this film *needs* suspense. Why not make this backstory something the ghost-hunters must unravel during their ongoing investigation? Forget about that helpful hint from Plot Construction 101.<br /><br />Everything that follows involves your garden-variety Things That Go Bump in the Night, Something Invisible Pulled My Leg, The Clocks Stop a Little After 3AM!, Let's Set Up Some Religious Icons Around the House, Little Amy's Got an Imaginary Playmate, and Who Knew There Was a Boarded-Up Cellar in This Place? drivel. All of these motifs have been used before and to much greater cinematic effect. The whole thing plays like a dreary mashup of Poltergeist + An American Haunting + Paranormal Activity + The Exorcist + The Amityville Horror + Name Your Rip-Off Scare-Flick. Overall, there's not a frightening thing about this movie's impact, though a couple of scary images and gags do work well (the imagery of the oncoming storm and the brief shape-shifting of the clothesline bedsheet, the spiral-mirrored music box, a creepy game of clap-tag). A worthwhile film is not made by a few clever sight-gags, however. The actors, from Lily Taylor to Vera Farmiga to Ron Livingston all do fine work. Even the kids are convincing and obviously talented. Patrick Wilson is about as wooden and silly as the Annabelle Doll that plays an unintentionally funny cameo role, but no matter how competent or incompetent the cast, they can't do much with a hackneyed storyline. On the plus-side, the sets are excellent --very 1971-era authentic-- and the cinematography is solid. Kudos to the crews responsible for those elements. The smartest character in this botched affair was the dog, who knew a stinker (and a haunted house) when she smelled one and had the good sense to croak in her third scene, albeit without much emotional resonance or exploration. How vapid.<br /><br />This brings me back to the foolishness of this film's backstory and the precipitous revelation of that backstory (see above). Is the crazy old witch a ghost, or a demon, or what? In the very first scene of this flick, the Warrens explicitly counsel a bunch of nitwits that ghosts have no power to cause physical harm. Only demons &#34;which have never walked in human form&#34; can do that stuff. Well, this human witch apparently hung herself and stayed on in the house (or around the property) as a ghost. That is, until she possesses the mother ... which would make her a demon? But she was human. And if this witch-ghostie-demon has the power to summon storms and flocks of birds and levitate and teleport and make things fly through the air, why did she hang herself from a tree in her nightgown in the first place? What was she afraid of, with all that power? Gah! This plot has more holes than a bag of Swiss Cheese slices and there's no rescuing a film this ultimately stupid and obvious and gimmicky and incoherent and half-baked. Too bad for Lili Taylor and actors like Farmiga and Livingston; again, they all do their best but it's sad to see them in an expensive project unworthy of their talents. I would like my money back on this one, without doubt. Look to classic older films for your horror fix, viewers. Do you want to know what is the only scary thing about this mess?<br /><br />The majority of people seem to have lost all ability to discern quality from crap. Think about THAT in the wee small hour of midnight and shiver.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very enjoyable! Fun, and just challenging enough. I highly recommend it! Very interesting concept. I wish there were more levels. I enjoyed it
0525478817|5.0|If you haven't read this book yet, you are missing out. It is an absolutely one of a kind story, that keeps you hooked until the very end, and even long after you've put it down. This is the only book I've ever cried at; not even Marley and Me got me sobbing like this book. And you know what? I'm not afraid to admit that, not with the fault in our stars.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|have experienced too many glitches to enjoy as much as I would like . Had great fun playing with 4 others while on vacation.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Any Bruce Willis film is bound to show lots of action and mystery.<br />It will keep you on your toes.
B008JFUNHI|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It had all the elements that keep one in their seat during a flick - suspense, good acting, interesting story line, great visual effects, the appropriate amount of emotion, and the unexpected ending. What else could you ask for in a movie? I'm going to see it again.
0375842209|5.0|wanted to see the movie...but always like to read the book first...cant wait to hunker down to read this soon
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Great movie.  Saw it in theaters and purchased DVD for 80 y.o mom to watch.  She loved it.  Drama, suspense and comedy combined.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fun and amusing to read. Great for teenagers. The ending leaves a blank feeling.<br />I suppose the author meant this to be.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Been waiting on this for quite some time. This little product works really well and I watch videos from tabs.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This series is wonderful! So many emotions, so much depth, such impressive illustration of what it means to be a human being and experience the endless challenges and blessings that come with that.<br />I closed this book feeling faithful, hopeful, grateful.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This story was compelling from the first sentence. I felt as though I had entered a time in the past and felt the warmth of the actual kitchen house and all its surroundings.  This story ended with me begging for more. Very well written about the true South in a time long past. Sad, but true.
B00F880BWG|5.0|It shows how to work together as a group to survive. How to deal with situations with little or no resources.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a great game,with the exception of the fact that you can only play 5 times every 15 minutes

0307383415|5.0|Excellent!  President Obama made it happen by his determination.  He had no idea but had dreams.  We never know where we will go in life but with faith, tenacity, personal belief in yourself, we can do anything, achieve anything, be anything no matter what others may say. With God all things are possible, if you believe...
B004VMUS9G|1.0|It does not work.<br /><br />Installed it on my kindle, and it just does not work.<br /><br />Did not try to troubleshoot or figure out why as it was a free app, so I just deleted it and went back to using Iphone alarm.

1607066017|5.0|I've been reading and collecting comic books for the last 37 years straight. I was very skeptical about the popularity of Saga but decided to give it a shot anyways and.... I could not be HAPPIER for taking the chance. Saga is one of the most incredible comic book stories or just stories in general that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I now look forward to reading new monthly comic releases of Saga each month to continue forward in the EPIC storyline that is Saga.
0307237702|5.0|Outstanding! An excellent read for young and advanced in age of the promises that materializes with continued hope and faith in God and yourself.  Very inspirational.  This book should be part of the college curriculum as required reading.

B00B22ASUM|5.0|This is not a super must-read classic literature work, but this is a humble and well written story of a strayed human being who recalls how it feels to be a human being with the help of a strayed animal being. A must read for every modern human being.
B004LM72ZY|1.0|Cute but the top will not stay on.  Makes it hard for active child play.  Three year old has trouble making it stay together and putting it together.  The screw on top is not easy to align to screw it on.
1937053571|5.0|There are no words to adequately describe how amazing this book is. All authors should take a page from Jen and realize that this is how you end a series! Sentinel picks up right where we left off in Apollyon, Alex, Aiden, and gang are trying to find a way to defeat Ares, all while trying to hold it together. This is seriously one of the craziest books I have ever read in regards to the emotional roller coaster the reader endures throughout reading. This novel is packed with action, adventure, and excitement, all while reminding us that these strong, brave characters are still human. It takes an amazing author to be able to do this, and Jen is an expect.<br /><br />Alex and Aiden are stand out in this novel. Yes, the story has always revolved around them, but this amps up the romance between them. There are some of the sweetest moments I have ever read, which could only be pulled off by someone like Jen. If you weren't rooting for them before, you will be while reading this. I was worried that this book might focus too much on Alex feeling sorry for herself or having a hard time coping with the events that happened at the end of Apollyon, but no sirree! Alex comes back ready to fight to the end. She knows the consequences that could occur, but that doesn't stop her from going full throttle, balls to the wall, warrior girl. I was also worried that Aiden might resort to old ways and push Alex away. But have no fear, Aiden and Alex are closer than ever, and they stand by each other through thick and thin.<br /><br />After the last book, I was really hating Seth, but honestly, after the ending of this book, I totally love Seth again. He is such a complex, crazy man that drives me insane, but trust me, your feelings will change toward him by the end of this novel.<br /><br />Last but certainly not least, I must talk about the ending. The ending was so utterly heartbreaking at one point, and had me sobbing. So much happens that I wouldn't be able to keep this review spoiler free if I told you even basic details. So I'll say this, a lot of stuff goes down, and it's not all good. We lose people that are near and dear to us, and I'll tell you now, you will not be happy when one person dies. And just when you're heart is broken and you see no possible way for a happy ending, picture a little Jen Armentrout on your shoulder whispering, \\"Everything will work itself out.\\" Because it does...in a humungous way. And I was literally cheering and smiling so big by the very last page. The ending is chock full of action, sadness, and tears, but also happiness and victory. Just be warned that you're heart and head will go through some serious emotions.<br /><br />Overall, this is simply an amazing book, and an even more amazing end to the Covenant series. Jen is literally a book writing ninja that just amazes you with her skills time and time again. While I'm sad that this is the last book of Alex and Aiden, I will definitely be revisiting their world time and time again! Go get this book now! Happy reading :)<br /><br />5+++++++ stars
B0015DROBO|5.0|Larson creates characters you care about and complex but plausible plots.  It's the kind of book you don't want to end because you don't want to say good bye to the cast.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very cool realistic complicated game. Keeps your interest. Lots of interesting puzzles and clues to figure out. Keeps you interested for a long time. Excellent graphics too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Definitely a good game. Keeps u thinking &amp; thinking logically. Like that u have to zoom in &amp; out &amp; from 1 side o  the room to the other
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I loved this book! it was an amazing journey for Cassia and I believe that she learned a lot. I enjoyed getting to know Ky more in this book I thought his chapters insightful. We really didn't get to know that much about him in Matched and it was nice to get inside his head. I hope in Reached we will be able to do the same to Xander.<br /><br />Ally Condie is an Amazing author and I look forward to reading more of her work to come. she paints an amazing world of beauty yet coats it in tar so that one must push through to see it. A must read for one and all!

B0045HCJSK|3.0|When a critic or an academic evaluates a movie like it is the treasure from the El Dorado, moviegoers are understandably hesitant to see it, fearing it would not meet expectations. When I saw \\"Rio Bravo\\", it was when I was unaware who Howard Hawks was and that the movie itself was held in high esteem. I thought it was a good Western, if nothing more. Afterwards, I read the enthusiastic essay about it by Robin Wood, who considered it a masterpiece and one of Hawks' finest movies. So I saw it again and my reaction was simply the same. When Roger Ebert put it on his Great Movies list, I saw it the third time, hoping that I would discover something that I didn't in my previous viewings. In the end, I was convinced - this movie is not as good as critics or academics claim it is.<br /><br />It's been stated that \\"Rio Bravo\\" was made in a reaction towards \\"High Noon\\", which was about a sheriff asking the townspeople to help him face Frank Miller. That's highly appropriate since \\"High Noon\\" is not only a better directed Western than \\"Bravo\\", it's also has better pacing, acting, suspense and writing. It also helps that it's under 90 minutes in length. By comparison, \\"Bravo\\" suffers from a meandering pacing, uneven acting, scenes that rarely end and supposedly charming oddities that add nothing to the picture. Bizarrely, these deficiencies are regarded by critics, who felt that they help make the movie a richer experience and more endearing. If Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder appeared to destroy a movie set, they would think that was endearing as well.<br /><br />The gushing praise and overblown enthusiasm about the movie says less about the movie's merits than it does about the folly of auteur theory. At the time of \\"Bravo\\"'s release, many academics, particularly French critics, re-evaluated Howard Hawks as a major cinematic artist because most of the movies he made bore a signature style. Never mind the fact that some of Hawks' pictures (\\"Monkey Business\\", \\"Land of the Pharaohs\\" and \\"Bravo\\" rehashes \\"El Dorado\\" and \\"El Lobo\\") were awful, but because they looked like Hawks, they were suddenly considered good movies. \\"Bravo\\" was suddenly elevated to the status of masterpiece even further by the likes of Robin Wood and Todd McCarthy, seeing it as a work of cinematic art, instead of the lighthearted entertainment that it is.<br /><br />I'm sorry but \\"Rio Bravo\\" is no more of a work of art than an episode of \\"Rawhide\\". As one Amazon.com reviewer pointed out, \\"Bravo\\" looks like something straight out of a TV western. And the movie's \\"charms\\", \\"quirkiness\\" or \\"added touches\\" don't make the movie stronger; they actually prove distracting. For example, was there any need for that rolling tumbleweed when Wayne and Martin are searching the town? Or the pointless sequence where Nelson sings a tune? That Hawks made it doesn't change the fact that it's a very flawed movie. One has to wonder - if Anthony Mann, Fred Zinnemann or Michael Curtiz's names were on the picture instead of Hawks, would these academics still show their appreciation for the movie? Highly unlikely.<br /><br />Which leads to the audio commentary. In the commentary, John Carpenter remarks that \\"Rio Bravo\\" redefined the Western genre. Bullocks. Westerns that came after \\"Rio Bravo\\" - \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" (1960), \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" (1962), \\"Ride the High Country\\" (1962), \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" (1968), \\"The Wild Bunch\\" (1969), \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" (1969), \\"McCabe & Mrs. Miller\\" (1971) and \\"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\\" (1973) and as far late as \\"Dances With Wolves\\" (1990) and \\"Unforgiven\\" (1992) owed very little to \\"Rio Bravo\\"; they were in fact were polar opposites of the movie, aesthetically, politically and psychologically. Most of them also had better acting, a greater sense of pace, stronger scripts, richer themes and meaning, even better comedy. They also appeared more on the directors' favorite Western lists than \\"Bravo\\". Case in point, how important is \\"Rio Bravo\\" when it has not yet even been inducted in the National Film Registry, but most, if not all, the aforementioned post-Bravo westerns have?<br /><br />Westerns that came BEFORE \\"Rio Bravo\\" - \\"High Noon\\" (1952)\\", \\"Shane\\" (1953), \\"The Searchers\\" (1956), even Hawks' own \\"Red River\\" (1948) did more to bring legitimacy and importance to the genre. \\"High Noon\\", which is greatly disdained by academics who praise \\"Rio Bravo\\", is a far richer, more emotionally resonant Western and certainly far more influential. I'm sorry but if a Western is publicly embraced by Eisenhower, Clinton and the Bushes, then clearly it's far more important than \\"Rio Bravo\\". What's funny is that when \\"Rio Bravo\\" came out, it was not well-received and was dismissed as an ordinary Western, which it, more or less, is. Now it's dangerously on the verge of being overrated.<br /><br />The acting, considered one of the greatest aspects of the movie, is strongly uneven. Ricky Nelson is dead weight as the gun-swinging child prodigy Colorado, delivering lines in a lethargic manner that would embarrass George Lucas. His relationships with John Wayne and Dean Martin are nowhere near as strong and enjoyable as the relationships between Montgomery Clift, John Wayne and Walter Brennan in \\"Red River\\". Brennan himself is hopelessly unfunny as the comic relief Stumpy, whose eccentric elderly behavior has been better expressed many times before, including by Hank Worden in \\"The Searchers\\". Most disappointingly, as Feathers, Angie Dickinson adds very little to this movie, a shocker when one knows how much Hawks' women contribute to his movies. Angie's Feathers may well be the first Hawksian woman without depth, a strong contrast to the more multidimensional Hawksian women played by Lauren Bacall, Katharine Hepburn and Jean Arthur. And she certainly doesn't have the emotional complexity as Katy Jurado or even Grace Kelly in \\"High Noon\\".<br /><br />On the other hand, John Wayne and Dean Martin deservedly earned praises for their strong performances. John T. Chance serves as the perfect surrogate father of this wacky, unusual family of deputies and Wayne's no-nonsense, goodhearted acting gives him likeability and warmth. Martin is spellbinding as the tormented recovering alcoholic Dude. The most moving scene in the picture comes as Dude tries to resist a drink when a Mexican tune is played in the background. Suddenly, he overcomes this addiction, controlling his shakes and becoming a stronger character. The emotional nakedness in Martin's face says things where dialogue is unneeded. It's a tiny classic scene, one that deserves to be evaluated.<br /><br />I am not taking away from the movie's positives, as there are just as many as there are negative. Besides the good performances by Martin and Wayne and the aforementioned redemption scene for Dude, the opening four-minute sequence where Dude is taunted for his alcoholism is masterfully directed, all told with silence, as is the exciting shootout scene between Chance's crew and the Burdettes at the movie's climax. And the final sequence where Wayne and Dickinson finally embrace each other has the cackling wit severely lacking in their previous scenes together.<br /><br />\\"Rio Bravo\\" is packed with some excellent scenes, some good performances and a rousing climatic action sequence. But it's hardly a masterpiece and a movie worth analyzing for school essays. As entertainment, \\"Bravo\\" delivers the goods. But if you want a better example of a Hawks western, watch \\"Red River\\" instead.<br /><br />Recommended.t, how important is \\"Rio Bravo\\" when it has not yet even been inducted in the National Film Registry, but most, if not all, the aforementioned post-Bravo westerns have?<br /><br />Westerns that came BEFORE \\"Rio Bravo\\" - \\"High Noon\\" (1952)\\", \\"Shane\\" (1953), \\"The Searchers\\" (1956), even Hawks' own \\"Red River\\" (1948) did more to bring legitimacy and importance to the genre. \\"High Noon\\", which is greatly disdained by academics who praise \\"Rio Bravo\\", is a far richer, more emotionally resonant Western and certainly far more influential.

0399534601|5.0|This is a great book for homeschoolers, all teachers, even adult writers.  It's presentation is unconventional: a smorgasbord of pictures, words, and very creative graphic organizers. As students, teachers, and writers we all are prone to just get 'stuck' sometimes. This book can give a jump start to looking at things differently. Things could be anything from a chair, to cracks in the sidewalk. The book gets one to start thinking outside the box, so to speak.  It is not a book meant to be read cover to cover from start to finish.  It works best by randomly opening to a page an seeing how it fits with what you are trying to do.  Seeing how it helps to propel you forward in your current quest.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|Not as responsive as the cat.  Doesn't hold my toddlers interest.  Doesn't repeat vocals either easily.  Free so try it and decide.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|I liked this, but not as much as the first book--Fall of Giants.  Though grand in scope, it spends too much time, and oversimplifies, the personal relationships at the expense of the broader historical context.  Also, it stretches a little too far the coincidence of encounters of characters introduced in the first book.  It might be more effective to use a new set of characters, developed in historical context.  That said, I enjoyed the evolution of the US in international politics and the perspective on Soviet Russia as it evolved.  I'm looking forward to the third book in this trilogy, and appreciate the author's ambitious effort to capture the 20th century in his characters.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you are a geek or like sci-fi, you will love this book. Highly recommend it! It's a fast and fun read.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This series was amazing. The ending tore me to shreds but it taught me so much. Everything in it is really inspirational and I really have no words. I'm crying my eyes out right now. Haha. But read it. Really.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like Castleville, so I was happy to see it available as a mobile app. So far, so good! It's fun and quick to play.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great version of solitaire for the Kindle!  You can do multi-player games; orientation, background, colors, and card backs and faces are customizable.  If you play while online you will get ads between games (got to pay the bills somehow!) and if you play while offline, you get a simple small display ad between games BUT all these can be skipped. The game keeps stats on your play so you can compare your performance with previous games and it has sounds if you want.<br /><br />You can draw three or draw one with Vegas or standard scoring and two deals: winning and random.  Winning deals ALWAYS have a solution - random deals can lead you into a blind alley but there is a `hint' button if you get really stuck.<br /><br />Overall, this is the best solitaire game (and terrible time-suck) I've found so far.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is an awesome game. You can learn to operate as well as fire the virtual version of real<br />life weapons
B009M2T7K6|5.0|Beautiful Mermaid Doll. My daughter is truly going to love this barbie for Christmas. I am prepping early to make sure shipping is not a delay due to the holidays. Anyway, the mermaid is a water change mermaid and I like that her tail has the ability to move.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this EVERYDAY! I drive everyone crazy with this game.  I make everyone wait till my game is done before they can talk to me even.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|The New Oxford American Dictionary was a book I found to be helpful, and with a free online subscription also!

B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry does it again. He closes out a cold case. 20 years after the death of a free lance  newspaper writer/ photographer, Harry must follow the clues.  It leads him out of town and out of his jurisdiction.  This story kept me reading late into the night.

B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|It has been quiet a number of years since the last Fielding book I read and it took me about 30 pages to get back into her style. Bridget doesn't seem to have evolved much in the passing years. She is a prime example, that multi-tasking doesn't pay off.

B00G32TD98|5.0|Awesome, absolutely scary.  You know it's coming but it still freaks you out highly recommended for any scary movie fan
B0089LOG02|4.0|Very interesting story line.  I wasn't familiar with this historical event of farming out orphans.  The parallel with a modern-day foster teen gave even more depth and relevance to the plight of children without family.  The book is well written.  I recommend it for all adults, and teens as well.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar was the first new technology 3D movie to hit the screen and transformed the future of 3D.  This DVD/BR combo pack help you keep the memory alive of when you went to see the movie.<br /><br />Pros: includes both BR and DVD<br />Cons: None<br /><br />Enjoy the movie again and again.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I do not share the critical view of others regarding the latest version, though it is in my opinion a small step backward. It is slightly harder to locate the forecasts I am interested in, but overall not a hardship. I don't feel compelled to find another app, but then weather is not that big an interest for me.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This is a great game, just wish you didn't h a v e to wait for more lives and more areas to open.  Seems like you get on a roll a n d then you have to stop, or spend tons of cash
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love this game! much better than candy crush. no need to buy extras. you get to keep playing until you win the level.
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|Fun good art easy to play would recommend to those who like this and other games like this<br />. Purchase for free if need be
B0007DFJ0G|2.0|Director David Fincher's cult drama remains an acquired taste. &#34;Fight Club&#34; (1999) exhausts its postmodern style after 20 minutes — plummeting into unpleasant, pretentious chaos. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter give it their best shot amid the narrative disintegration. When the dust has settled, &#34;Fight Club&#34; is little more than cinematic excess masquerading as art.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Pretty much the plot and character development of a decent TV movie, but definitely passes the time on a long flight.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a good game for me. Just started gaming again after a long hiatus. Things have change since NINTENDO in the 9th grade.
B006FWZMSW|2.0|The ebook is just another ebook.  I bought this mainly for the audio portion which will not work.  I am quite dissappointed!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This could be amazing, and by all rights the app IS amazing, but it requires Internet access to use.  Not just to access your bookmarks and personal features, but you cannot even open the Bible without it.  As a result, unless you have Internet access at all times, and lets face it, the world is full of dead zones, this app is unusable.<br /><br />Would love to change this rating when the requirement is removed.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Good game. Fun to play. A little too much down time.  Seems like the game wants to be fed 99&cent; every few minutes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wonderfully challenging. Each level is able to be completed during a quick coffee break. Highly recommended. Try it, you'll like it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the two movies and the game. One of my favorites  to say the least!  It's looks great on my kindle too.
B00006JI11|1.0|Crappy DVD that requires you to change the region of DVD player to watch. I Don't recommend to anyone that lives outside the USA.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my friend and I love this game!!! who wouldn't like this game? it's awesome! get this game!!! my bff would not stop playing this game. I told her to play with me but she was addicted to this game. so for the next sleep over I didn't bring my tablet. she was sad but still had lots of fun playing with more than the tablet.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Worked well with my kindle fire HD. Highly recommended!<br />Definitely noticed an increase in speed. Thanks for a fantastic so!
B005EIS5IW|3.0|At the .99 cent price I got it at it was worth it. But there is no way I would pay almost 8 bucks for it. Pretty short, I flipped through it in about ten-fifteen minutes. Some were cute but nothing really made me laugh out loud. I doubt I'll be buying the other one available.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Omg!!! It's finally n Kindle!!! I can now play on the go addicting and fun.. thanks Amazon and the owner of the kindle fire !
B00FHATBGW|5.0|This is another interesting, point and click murder mystery game. It has hidden object searches, but for those who don't like HO, not to worry, they are very easy and not too often. The story revolves around an old secret society, a mystical boy who seems to take souls, and several murders. It's very engaging! There are many locations to explore and you must return to them several times over, so be aware there is a lot of back and forth - but it didn't bother me.<br /><br />I played in casual mode on 1st generation kindle fire with no problems. There are arrow hints for available directions of travel, and  sparkles over hidden object searches, but not much more help than that. There is also a hint button, and a detailed journal which keeps track of your clues and progress. The graphics are clear, and the screen zooms if you need to see things better. The voice over parts are well done. This is a very long game - it took me about a week to finish playing every night. This app is fairly large at 409.1MB and it all goes into your application storage, so make sure you have the room. Overall a very good game for fans of this genre and also not too difficult, so beginners won't have any problems either.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is a lot of fun, until you get to the part where you  have to join facebook and get friends to help you, pay to unlock the next level, or wait 3 days to advance.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I liked the film. Hoping the next film is longer and good. I wish I didnt have to wait so long.

B00942G4UA|5.0|This film contains an important message that may not be familiar to all--the cruel and unhealthy circumstances in which sentient animals are born, raised and killed to be eaten by humans. Further, the film exposes the ways in which mega food producers rely on farming methods to maximize volume (and profits) rather than quality of food produced, often to the detriment of human and animal health.
B004OC07GM|4.0|Does an excellent job of explaining core ideas but is repetitive. Leaves the reader better prepared to identify disruptive technologies in a given market and how best to deal with the.

1742204120|5.0|My wife and I used to be inveterate world travelers, having visited 50 countries over the past few decades. We make few international trips these days, mainly because we've both become far less tolerant of the time-consuming, demeaning and frustrating hassles of modern-day travel. But one country near the top of the list of places we'd like to return to someday in the future is India. We spent a month there in the mid-1980s, traveling across the length and breadth of the country, and in that time we barely scratched the surface of the sights, sounds, tastes and experiences that the subcontinent offers the curious, open-minded visitor.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of Lonely Planet guidebooks. The Lonely Planet books we used on our many trips to exotic, off-the-beaten-track places were great at steering us to things we were interested in seeing and doing. Even on our Wilderness Travel and Mountain Travel-Sobek group trips, Lonely Planet books were still extremely useful. I have no use for guidebooks filled with pretty color pictures. I prefer them to contain authoritative text, written by people who really know the areas, and good maps. Lonely Planet's \\"India,\\" 15th Edition, is a great example of exactly what I look for in a travel guidebook.<br /><br />This compact, tightly bound, 1248-page volume is densely packed with small but very readable text in two-column format. There are very few photos in the volume. I didn't count them, but I doubt there are more than 15 or 20. The photos appear in several full-color inserts delineated by red page-edge tabs, and most are in conjunction with very impressive 3D renderings of major Indian attractions, such as the Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri and Mysore Palace.<br /><br />The volume kicks off with a 54-page \\"Plan Your Trip\\" section that features a great full-color, two-page map, the \\"Top 17\\" attractions, need-to-know items, suggested itineraries and other useful, practical information. The bulk of the volume, from pages 55 to 1102, is the \\"On the Road\\" section, which divides the country into 23 regions and offers an almost overwhelming amount of information on each of them. Fortunately, it's all very well organized and user-friendly. Chapter headings, titles and interesting sidebars stand out in soothing shades of pale blue, which also highlight features on the many small but useful maps interspersed throughout the text. Blue page tabs demark the sections keyed to the specific regions. This is the meat of the book, and it's filled to bursting with comprehensive information, including phone numbers and websites, on attractions, lodging, restaurants, events and festivals, shopping, outdoor activities, etc. As with all guidebooks, of course, some of this material may be out-of-date or flat wrong when you visit India, but you can't quibble about its breadth, depth and completeness.<br /><br />The penultimate section, \\"Understand India,\\" offers 70 pages of insights into India's history, way of life, religions, cuisine, art, architecture, wildlife and more. Finally, \\"Survival Guide\\" closes out the volume with almost 50 pages of information on scams, women and solo travelers, customs, money, visas and other practical, day-to-day realities of dealing with the legendary Indian bureaucracy.<br /><br />India offers so much to see and do that no single travel guidebook can address every visitor's interests. Lonely Planet's \\"India\\" is no exception. But it does cover virtually everything we saw and did in the country when we were there. I think it's a perfect guidebook for the Western tourist who wants to understand the country and get the most out of a visit. But don't think it's an armchair travel guide. Since it has so few photos, you won't leaf through it, spot a stunning color picture and say, \\"Wow, that looks like a great place to visit.\\" But, in my opinion, it IS one of the best guidebooks you can have when you're actually IN India. It's as complete a single-volume portrait of the country andits people as any I've seen. Adventurous, curious, independent travelers can't do better than to make sure it's in their suitcase or backpack when they visit one of the most fascinating countries on Earth.its people as any I've seen.

B008JFUS0U|2.0|Just saw this piece of Low Brow Super Hero Crap, and if you have any intelligence whatsoever, STAY AWAY!  This film is for 12-22 year olds, who just want to see stuff go 'Boom' . The story and/or Plot is nonexistent, it feels completely put together by Committee ( I just read it had 5 writers!), and it felt like they didn't edit out any of their storylines! This movie jumps all over the place, with bad editing, bad dialogue, moderate CGI, and no Charachter development whatsoever. In fact, it's obvious in several scenes with Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston, that they manipulated Chris Hemsworths voice to lower it and make him sound more Shakesperian. It just sounds like he has a head cold, so sad and desperate. Poor Chris just comes off as a Lifeguard in a Super Hero Outfit. (Is he destined to be the new Brad Pitt?).<br /><br />Its also annoying that we had to sit through a full trailer for 'Captain America', AFTER the movie started! And then have<br />numerous idiotic references to S.H.I.E.L.D, which leads me to believe the 2 assistants are going to appear on the TV show soon. (Its just one more Example of Pointless interruptions in Story & Logic.) the 'humour' is LAME and unnecessary, and the 'Chick Flick' feel every time Natalie Portman enters a scene is soooooo annoying. This Film has the Worst Case of 'Identity Crisis' I've ever seen!<br /><br />This movie will appeal to the lower of the Common Denominators, but if Marvel really intends to have a future as a Studio with Disney, they need to commit to a good script before the first day of shooting. PS: Loki is the ONLY saving grace in this film. Marvel needs to give him his own film soon, or Risk losing a huge portion of their audience. Just because we're over 25 doesn't mean our voices don't count (Even over the sound of Cold Hard Cash), which won't last forever! History has shown, if you are only coveting the younger audience, you will eventually Lose, as they BORE faster than any other segment of the population. You have been warned.
0792164903|5.0|Great price and terrific movie. A perfect fit for Halloween. Would like to see a sequel with the cast. Soon.
0679805273|5.0|My all-time favorite childrens' book. It makes me smile and cry at the same time. Priceless! Every child needs this book. It reaches out with compassion and tenderness to children and teaches them about their self-worth and how important they are.

B00FPGV3RS|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie.  The trailer was fantastic... and the movie was dreadful.  Waste of time and money.
B000FBJAF0|4.0|What it lacks in subtlety, it more than makes up with page turning action,suspense and complex plot.  Everything one would want in a thriller.

B009EJSQ3G|5.0|First saw ABBA on American Bandstand in 1975 singing SOS and I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.  If you've never seen this it can be found on youtube. A week or so later they were on The Midnight Special.  Believe it or not until MTV started showing videos in the early 80's(?) I never saw them perform again though I did become a fan and buy their albums and tapes (yeah 8 track for the car)  Between the quality of their songs, the voices of Agnetha and Frida, and of course the girls looks how could one not love this band?<br /><br />Too me nothing has changed from the original release of this album in the 70's, the songs are still great.  The value in this deluxe package to me is the dvd TV performances and the pomo videos ABBA produced.  As others have said listening to ABBA just leaves one feeling good.  Seeing them perform only adds to the experience.<br /><br />Many have posted about the lip syncing and the lack of \\"live\\" singing.  Not sure I agree with this assessment. The \\"Made in Sweden for Export\\" are promos and are synced.  The bonus single performances  \\"SOS seaside\\" and \\"Mama Mia in blue satin\\" are certainly live. The Australian Special I'm not sure if it's synced or not.<br /><br />In any case live or synced it doesn't take away from the value that comes in this package. If you weren't around in the 70's to see Agnetha and Frida you owe it to yourself to get this deluxe package.  Entertainers just don't get any better than ABBA.  I know I will be picking up their other deluxe cds soon.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I always hate to see a favorite series (in this case, trilogy) go while at the same time I love to see how everything is going to end up. Before I managed to finish this book I knew that there was some controversy about it and I know there are plenty of people unsatisfied with what happened. Though I have to say this book ripped my heart out and made me cry more than I'd like to admit, I still can't see the sense in disliking it because of that.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the first book of this series, Divergent, and didn't like Insurgent as much as that. I think that I like this third book more than I liked the second one. It was just so much more interesting to me and I loved not knowing what would happen next. I can't say anything specific without giving away spoilers but be satisfied knowing that there are very cute scenes and scenes filled with action and suspense.<br /><br />That said, I didn't get the same heart-pounding feel I had through most of Divergent until I got to maybe the last third of the book. But I loved the pacing in this, even though some scenes felt very unnecessary. I liked being able to see more of the characters from other books in calmer settings, not just when they're about to get killed. The theme of forgiveness that was strong in the first two books makes its return here in new but equally heartbreaking ways.<br /><br />I did like hearing from both Tris and Four in this book. However, I didn't like how similar their voices were. I'd often find myself reading and thinking that it was one of them, only to find out that the character I thought was speaking was somewhere else in the room. That made me backtrack a few times and tended to be annoying. I just wish that they'd had more unique voices.<br /><br />If you haven't read Allegiant yet, go and pick it up now! This is a quick read, despite its bulk, and I want to hear your thoughts on everything that happens!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was worried that it would end weird, it didn't. Very happy that we get to spend some more time with Danny  :o)

B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|Equilibrium is a very deep movie in a shell of an action thriller. It is not just one of the another &#34;I will shoot all the bad guys&#34; action. The idea behind it is great. Makes you think twice about your own emotions, the society, and the government. Not to mention that the actors are great.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is hands down my favorite book. Every time I reread something new and magical strikes me. The subtle rhyming, the easy to miss truths, the character developments gentle flow. I love everything about this book and I would suggest it to anyone and everyone I know with the wit to fully appreciate it.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Interesting research that shows we are all the products of our inheritance and gives ideas for how we can make everyone more successful.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|In a world overflowing with choices of what to read and watch, my favorite way to choose is my friends that can't shut up about a book or movie. I have a friend who bugged me every few months for a year to read this, and thank goodness! Wool was engaging, well paced, and full of great characters. Full of every kind of suspense, of tinkering mysteries, political and psychological intrigue, and more. Can't wait to check out the next howdy books!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Are you serious with that ending, Veronica Roth?  (this review contains spoilers at the end of it)  background: I loved this series. I've been recommending it to everyone. I was an early adopter and read the first 2 books a couple times.  This?  Was just…  ugh. Not a great installment. Such a great build. Such a great framework laid. It all fizzled with very little fulfillment as a reader. It had no sense of closure or purpose. For what reason did they go through all that? And I wondered when all the sudden book 3 had 2 voices instead of just the main character….  spoiler…. 10… 9… 8… 7… 6… 5… 4… 3… 2… 1…  i warned you….  I guess you have to introduce another voice if you kill off the main character or the book gets kinda quiet, huh?  So disappointed. Not at all redeeming of what this series was capable of. Darn.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I liked this book,I think it was the best book that John Grisham has written in years. It held my interest throughout and , it was a complicated story. I thought that I had it figured out, but I was very surprised in the end. I think the way the story ended was the way it should have ended. If only most conflicts in real life could be settled fairly. It makes you wish for that world.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I<br />love this game... I play it everywhere I go. The only problem I have is it takes to long to receive my tickets so I Kan kontinue
B004IY6API|5.0|Many argue that this is the first heavy metal album because it contains material that was never done before in 1978. I don't know for sure because I wasn't around at the time however I have to agree because I am not aware of any other albums before it that sounded like it does. This album influenced what metal was to become in the 1980's. I have to say this though, just enjoy the album and don't get all crazy with the subliminal message b/s. I've listened to it many times and I don't hear anything.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love these characters in the game more than the movie. Didn't expect the game to be so much fun and so addictive!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|The best movie I have seen in a long while HANDS DOWN. You would be a fool not to rent this
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|I have too many reasons for hating this movie to fit in this space. Mostly, it was extremely poor writing. If one Iron Man is good, then many must be better, right? WRONG! If putting our hero in the Iron Man suit, then putting many in such a suit is better, right? WRONG! This movie's plot goes against what those of us want of our hero and substitutes sound-and-fury special effects for wit and substance. One cardinal sin of this plot is that it makes the heroine into some sort of monster and - to &#34;solve&#34; this dilemma - hero Downey says at the end, &#34;I took care of the problem.&#34; THIS is WRITING a movie? Iron Man 2 was the predictable &#34;bigger Iron Man suit against the original Iron Man suit.&#34; - This was poor but not too bad. But this movie..3...is a bad cartoon of a valuable hero property.  This is the same thing that happened to Batman 3. Both are poorly conceived and written.
B0009UC810|5.0|One of the best movies of all time! I still don't remember seeing a movie where someone drives a car through a shopping mall. There is just so many reasons to buy this, can't think of any reasons not to!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Completely disappointed in the end.  I found the series initially unable to stop reading.  In this boo  it felt forced Nd I didn't like the way the story turned, but so is life, right?!?!?
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford features characters who will become like family. Endearing, irritating at times, loving, obnoxious--you'll be hooked before you get to the end of season 1, but watch till the end of the season because the final episode is full of twists & turns.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! I've been playing on my phone for some time. So glad it's finally available on the Kindle.
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|My favorite doors album, to this day roadhouse blues has to be one of the greatest songs of all time! This album has some other great blues style tracks which of course Jim loved to implement in his music!
B00CIR97UW|5.0|Excelent book! Clear explanations for all the math references in both The Simpsons and Futurama. The author's research plays a huge role in the book, giving also fun facts from baseball statistics to the margin of error for measuring the universe circunference.
B0053TMP24|3.0|The book Son Of Neptune was a little slow at certain points and got a little repetitive but was a good read for a young audience. I did enjoy it but sometimes found reading it a chore and was glad when it was finally over which is not a good sign. All in all I'd give this book a three out of five.
B00005JL3A|5.0|i love the resident evil franchise  the first is awesome but i like the second one the best if you like this movie watch the others

B002DR3WG2|3.0|I can see and understand the wit and cleverness of Austen's writing.  I appreciate it even more as I have learned more about her.  That all said, this wasn't a book I enjoyed.  I liked the study of the writing, but it was too sweet and flowery for me.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I read this series to share with my daughter but really enjoyed it! My daughter is enjoying the books as well. I will look for more books by this author.

B00CHVIAS4|5.0|It's a great family movie with a good message of the importance of family.  And it's pretty funny to boot!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Beautiful artwork, background music enjoyable, and the game is challenging to keep you returning.  It's the type of game to keep you mentally alert and don't we need that in the onset of \\"Old Age\\".  Keep up the great work!
B00280LYHS|4.0|I would give it 5 stars except it's too sad.  So many people die.  It's still a really good book and I recommend it, especially if you've read the other Percy Jackson books.

B000ICZD4I|1.0|It happens about half the time. You kick down payment for the movie and then it won't load. It is a puzzle how Amazon can be so efficient in there online shopping experience and so slip shod in their video presentations. So, once again, Amazon has my money and I can't give a movie review 'cause I never saw the movie!
B000002GKT|5.0|I AM A HUGE PIE FAN. THIS ALBUM IS THE PIE AT ITS BEST. I SEEN THEM LIVE IN SAN DEIGO BACK IN 1972 GREAT GET YOUR ASS UP OFF YOUR SEAT ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC.
B008JFUNJQ|5.0|I love Enders game and I have no calms about stating that it is my 2nd favorite book of all time. I didn't enjoy the sequels particularly because the appeal of Enders Game, the gripping story of a young boy coming to terms with violence and gripping philosophical questions were absent in Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide (not that I'm saying they are bad books by any stretch of the imagination).<br />Ever since I finished the book, I had the movie in my head, the shots of battle school, the intense battles inside the battle room, the space battles towards the end. I knew hollywood would take care of these (the battle room was PHENOMENAL) as they always do regards to SFX, but I was concerned that they will damn (if not discard) the emotional and philosophical messages in the film.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the film was not perfect by any means (I will tell you later why I give it 5/5) but Hood did such an excellent job keeping the core of Ender's Game (even though it felt slow at times) that I can't help but give him a standing ovation.<br /><br />This book is unfilmable, whether they did a 4 hour long film or made a TV show. Much of the greatness of Ender's Game is experienced through the mind of Ender and how he views the world and how he reacts to situations. It is all in his mind, the pang of committing violence, the doubt accompanying leadership, the rejection of friends etc. Thus, no film will do this novel justice but I think this adaptation comes close. Asa Butterfield is a perfect ender wiggan. The other child actors were decent and Harrison Ford was downright amazing.<br />Gavin Hood did a fantastic job of making this movie EPIC and reconstructing the imagination of my childhood but also took care to tell a balanced story.<br /><br />Many do not realize that this book is a daunting challenge to a film maker and Hood didn't disappoint. That's why he gets a 5/5 from me.<br /><br />I will buy this and watch it until it cannot be watched any longer. Saw it twice already. AMAZING MOVIE.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is really really really fun to play. You get to breed,buy,and get some dragons as a gift. I think you guys should try this game.
B0036BP6XQ|1.0|The instant video of Blind Side omits many scenes from the movie.  Some of the missing scenes are referenced in the trailer Amazon provides on the website.  I'm not interested in an incomplete version of the movie.  I'd like my $9.99 credited back. I'll be happy to delete it from my library.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was my first book by this author. I will now download others by her.  I could feel what these characters were feeling because while it was fiction, it was so true to life.  It gave me new perspective on life, marriage, kids, grand kids and everything that goes with it. I will be recommending this to friends for sure!

B007RRFUHM|5.0|I decided to check out the girl from the Gotye video and Wow!  If you are ever finding yourself in a trend of same ol same ol, Kimbra will bring you right out of the rut with a smile.  Brilliant voice, brilliant songs.  As an musician myself I will be studying the production of this album for quite a while.  The only thing is that I might have liked the reverb toned down a bit but it was clearly a stylistic choice and generally fits the album.  I've got no doubt she has a beautiful voice dry.  I like to her it that way someday.
0545586178|4.0|Catching Fire, the terrific sequel to The Hunger Games starts off right where The Hunger Games left off. Katniss is getting ready for her victory tour around the Districts when she is visited by the evil President Snow. He informs her that she must disappear from society after the tour, because there have been recent uprisings against the capital. She is the figurehead of the rebellion, because of her outward act of defiance in the 74th Hunger Game. The President tells Katniss that he will kill her friends and family if she doesn't comply. I was amazed at how Katniss is more than willing to give her own life, if it means that her friends and family will be safe. This shows Katniss’s role as a selfless leader and protector.<br /> On the Victory Tour, Katniss is informed that for the 75th “Quarter Quell,” two living victors of the Hunger Games, from each District, will compete in yet another fight to the death. Katniss and Peeta are yet again thrust into another deadly situation, where they must keep the story of their love alive. Also, Katniss and Peeta are now “engaged” and Katniss is “pregnant.” Throughout this entire situation, Katniss struggles with trying to define the relationships she has with Peeta, her fellow tribute and co-conspirator to the revolt, and Gale, her longtime childhood friend. She wants to be more than friends with Gale, but cannot risk letting the public know that she and Peeta aren't in love. In the end Katniss says, “Gale is mine. I am his. Anything else is unthinkable” (Collins, 110.)<br />Overall, I was pleased with how this sequel stuck with the main theme of defiance presented in the first book. Typically, sequels tend to stray from the main theme of the first book. Catching Fire does a great job of keeping the reader closely connected to the world of Panem. I also enjoyed how Katniss has one main external conflict, the rebellion, and then has many smaller branches of internal conflicts. It adds depth and complexity to our understanding of Katniss.of Katniss.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I wait with anticipation for each of his new books.  I could go on about how great he is, but all that has been said before much better than I could.  So I will hit a few points that I loved.  Although the setting isn't exactly &#34;urban,&#34; (it is more where the suburbs meet the country), I would still have to call this &#34;urban fantasy.&#34;  Its a story we all dream about.  What if life wasn't ordinary, but was instead magical.  And when as children the magic terrified us, when we look back on it as adults, that childhood magic is the most real experience we ever had.  My only complaint -- and its a small one -- is that a big sacrifice was made to carry our protagonist through the terrifying magic.  I want Mr. Gaiman to answer, maybe in his next book, whether our protagonist earned the sacrifice; will he accomplish something so beautiful, special, meaningful, or important that the sacrifice was worth it.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I love this movie so much. It was depicted well and the shipping was as it was, right on the day it came out. The only thing i wished that happend was it actually came with the code it said it came with for the free comic. Which that never came with it. But other than that, i am happy with this movie. Favorite!
B00E6887H0|5.0|LOVE IT! I am always looking for great, new music. This CD far exceeded my expectations. Ry Cooder, along with Corridos Famosos, again goes over the top. I love the compilations with the select group of artists/musicians. It's my fave!!!

B00E9PMMPI|3.0|Good sci-fi movie at the time it was made, but only okay with the cgi and special effects used in today's films.
B0051GOB26|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. It is just hilarious. The Big Lebowski flopped in theaters when it came out, but has a huge cult following that was stood against the rigors of time. This version has an ultraviolet code that let's you watch it without getting up to get the disc if your bluray player, game council, tv or other media has a flixster  or vudu app on it and internet connected to it. Handy if you've just smoked a joint or drank a few White Russians.<br /><br />Another thing this version has is an introduction skit that is as funny as any SNL skit.<br /><br />If a stoner movie about a pot head with a bowling addiction seems interesting at all then you want this movie.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Classic King.  Kids behaving badly, forshadowing of horrible event, and an unlikely evil killing thing.<br /><br />Mile 81 is EXACTLY what I like from King.  The master has not faded away after all.
B000A5044C|5.0|The movie is slow paced but shows the day to day struggles placed on the eldest son tasked with providing for all of his younger siblings.  Sad. Based on a true story of abandoned kids in Japan.
0307591549|5.0|I got this book after being impressed with Shawn's TED talk, which really resonated with me.  If you have not seen this talk, it's available on Netflix.  This book provides much more detail than was available in that TED talk, and is  written in a very entertaining style that is the author's hallmark. I'm very impressed. Following these principles has made me happier person.
B0018YIW4S|5.0|A very good job on this reissue.  The sound is top notch for live recording that was made over 30 years ago. I've always thought this was one of the best concert albums ever made. This version just takes that and makes it a little better with a couple extra tracks , that always should have been there, thrown in to the mix. If you like UFO, you will love this disc.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book I so recommended it to everyone it's the best book in the world<br />Says,<br />  Winstead kindle fire
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Well written...good suspense..just enough intrigue..grabbed you right from the start..another great one by this writer. Hope they bring the series back to TV
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun game play. Good<br />graphics. Decent interface. Menus are annoying, too many clicks to get back to game play mode.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The game is actually a nice rip off of Bejeweled. However--and this is why the app is a ZERO star--if you fail to finish a level a few times, they make you wait 20 minutes or so before you can try again. I understand the economics of trying to get you to buy CRAP to finish the level, but just because I *understand it, doesn't mean that I don't DESPISE the creators for it. As it stands now--with the time-outs--this is an UNPLAYABLE piece of crap. When they stop this nonsense, I'll put it back on my Fire. As it is now, I've deleted it into electron Hell...where it belongs.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|amazing graphics to this game. I cant stop playing it! such an amazing game for the kindle and its free!

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I had heard about Candy Crush, as I don't do Facebook had to wait for it to come on Amazon or Kindle. As I was told, the simple match 3 game is not so simple and I've found it challenging. Biggest complaints...1) Explain the basic premise, however have found nothing about what candies can combine to make bonus candies or how they work once used. 2) They tempt and nag before and after each level to Buy  more power ups. I don't think it's even possible if you have the patience of a saint, to play thru without spending more cash. For me that's enough of a resin to knock off a few stars.
1577314808|1.0|The author is completely self-serving and arrogant.  I gave it a star because there are a few things that one could use in this book, if you can find them through the prideful ramblings of the author.  Don't waste your time or your money unless you want to read this book with a friend for a good laugh.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|It's slim enough to allow the phone to sit in my pocket without feeling bulky. The edges don't protrude beyond the screen very far so it's easy to use yet still protects the screen if you set the phone down with the screen facing down. I have a screen protector on it as well but it's good to know the screen won't sit against the surface anyway. Plus I think it looks great!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie has some of the best 3-D effects that I've seen!  Wow, what a movie!  Recommend this store!  Product exactly as described, arrived on time, great service and price.  Thanks, Robert.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Oh. My. God. This book. This book has officially broaden my definition of what a thriller is and should be...<br /><br />GONE GIRL is about a couple who ends up manipulating each other, but I think it is more accurate to say that it is the writer who ends up manipulating the reader. Throughout the entire novel, Gillian Flynn succeeds in twisting your opinions until you're literally feeling feels and thinking thoughts that she wants you to have:<br /><br />You feel sorry for Nick in the beginning (I mean, laid-off and his wife goes missing) while reading his chapters and you start to love Amy while you read her diary entries. Then, things start to get darker in her entries and you begin to look at Nick's actions and motivations with new suspicion. Then, *bam* she hits you with a twist that you definitely weren't expecting and, now, you feel sorry for Nick for having married a psycho like Amy. Right when you think that you're officially on Nick's side is when she introduces new elements that makes you wonder just who you should be rooting for in the first place.<br /><br />To be honest, I didn't know how this book will read. When I think of thrillers, I think of Dan Brown or James Patterson with lots of actions and mysteries, not GONE GIRL. At least with those books, you know who the good guys are and you know (deep-down) that things are going to work out in favor for the protagonist.<br /><br />In GONE GIRL, there's no death-defying, heart-pounding action scenes. In fact, most of the scenes that would have been used to normally entice thriller readers (killing your captive, the actual act of running away, etc.) are told/implied instead of being shown to the readers.<br /><br />I loved the ending too! Unlike traditional thrillers (where you know the adventure/story ended unless there's a cliffhanger for the next book), her ending definitely led the door open to possibilities because this is a ﻿married couple﻿'s life that we're talking about.<br />Despite the fact that it was nothing like the thrillers I am used to reading, it kept me flipping the pages because of her impeccable pacing and also extremely psychotic characters. I will definitely be reading her other books!<br /><br />Originally published at [...]that it was nothing like the thrillers I am used to reading, it kept me flipping the pages because of her impeccable pacing and also extremely psychotic characters.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is an amazing app! I play it all the time on my kindle fire. I play it on my friends sisters iPad.  I love this game. I recommend this for people who love temple run. Have fun . Playing.
B005I64U5C|4.0|It was good.  3-D effects good.  After seeing Avatar or Men in Black, its hard to compete.  Recommend this store, Great Service!  Thanks, Robert
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Surprise! I knew the 'husband's secret\\", like almost everyone else, way before it was revealed in the book. I pretty much agree with everyone else giving it one star. Spineless, and I do mean spineless, men in this book. Too many characters and the book is all over the place. I found it annoying that she constantly used the last names of the characters over and over. Yeah, we get it. I think we know who you're talking about it. It must have been to get the word count up and make the book longer. I got it from the library so I didn't waste any money, just way too much time. I can't even tell you all the ways this book was horrible. Absolutely hate it.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|These puzzles don't let you zoom in close enough to be able to see the objects.  Needs variations in its puzzles.

B009VB9VKY|1.0|I kept hearing all about this movie. They really pushed it. I couldn't wait to see it, but it's just not that good. Boring is word to describe it.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|Bought this cd prior to a road trip and absolutely loved it. The older ladies were singing away to it and younger ones were dancing. The vibe from the audience cheering added a more &#34;real&#34; type of experience.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|A good app and pretty to boot.  Makes the weather at a glance easy!  Recommend to all who just want a quick glance.

B005LAJ16I|1.0|Yes. I was spoiled by The Sopranos, a phenomenally written, cast, and acted series.<br />Nothing else seems to measure up and Homeland is so far from good that I am shocked to see how many 5, 4, 3 and even 2-star ratings there are. Watch The Sopranos and see what a 5-star series looks like. This is not it.<br /><br />Homeland is soap opera at its worst and preposterous beyond belief. A psychotic nymphomaniac has security clearance for any government job? Ridiculous. The sex is gratuitous, an obvious time-filler. The dialogue is stupid and predictable. The acting was wooden or over the top.<br /><br />How many episodes did I watch? One. The person watching with me couldn't stand it, either.<br /><br />Look elsewhere if you want to be entertained.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|this is a great game but if you play like 8 times in a row than you have to wait 5 miniuts to regain your. &quot; energy &quot;. And if you don't want to play for hours on end be prepared to spend an insaine 5-15 $!
B0001IMCDE|1.0|Simply awful experience...first bad experience I have had at Amazon.  This DVD will not work in most DVDs...mostly<br />in USA or Canada.  Apparently this DVD was set up for over seas...and yes, it does say it in very small print now that<br />I have gone back to the home page.  For goodness sake, why would you place in on your USA sites if it did not work????<br /><br />Very, very, disappointed.  Not world peace...but definitely disappointed in Amazon for carrying this item that does not work.  I feel scammed!

It went from starring at it in two months since it was hanging in his rocker chair, then he started punching it -- barely toyching at first with his sdmall hands; then he started pulling it ... Then he started pulling it so he can bite it ; then he started calling it A-guuuu :-)  now he bites it, chews it, smiles at it and throws it around like it has been shot out of cannon. And its still holding!!!!<br />I had to remove the little part where it has the plastic like handle cauyse he kept stucking his
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This gorgeous, stunning film is a work of art. This is a movie that stays with you forever and there are few that succeed in touching the viewer that deeply.<br /><br />There are many characters to care about and feel for and they appear immediately in the film. Pi. His family. The animals. Throughout one wonders what will happen. Every color is perfect and balanced with other colors. The interior of the lifeboat against the color of the ocean is just magnificent. The acting is wonderful and the dialogue could not be better. So much care, love, and thought went into filming Life of Pi.<br /><br />I have decided which story is true and will watch it again and again and be affected again and again.<br /><br />A great film.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is an incredibly funny, witty, and sexy book with a lot of banter between the two main characters. Drew is the main character and most of the book is written through his perspective where he lays it out on the line truthfully. Ever wanted to know the truth on what men think - read this book! Lots of competition between the two main characters and lots of sexy scenes!!! YUM!
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Again found Florence by accident. Of all places the trailer of the movie Snow White and Huntsman.  Went looking for that song and found Florence and The Machine.  This is rare for me to like every track on an album, but ceremonials  has me hooked.  What I suggest is you listen to the tracks on  You tube, and if you like any of her work get the CD. I think you will like them all.  I do
B0041KKYCY|5.0|This is a far better film than the original - which in fairness is very dated now - this one is in line with the near the knuckle brutality & shock value of today . The acting in this film is very ,very good
B0077ATSSQ|1.0|but not when I was watching this awful film.<br /><br />Do not waste your time looking for a story, hoping for excellent dialogue and acting, or searching for even one character to care about. This ponderous film has none of those.<br /><br />I agree with every reviewer who said this was an emotionless exploitation of 9/11. It's merely a disjointed and preposterous story about an obnoxious boy who is on the screen eighty-five percent of the time, a clueless mother, an inexplicably mute grandfather, and a grandmother the child communicates with from his window to hers.<br /><br />Nominated for Oscars? I can't even comment on that.<br /><br />Awful.

I for one and very happy with all the songs on the disk, and have become addicted to Ms. Rey.<br />I also picked up the two cd from \\"florence and the machine\\"  My new concern is that I will ware out the Cd's. Also when I listen to them at work my co workers may get tired of hearing them, because I dont...lol
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I thought this book was so well written. All the characters families are all connect in a surprising way. After completing the story, I keep thinking how our lives are intertwined sometimes without our knowledge. And we can't fathom how our decisions and actions may affect the future or not. I highly recommend it. It would be a great book club read and discussion. Now I want to read other books by this author.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really like the Chromecast. Yes, it's currently still in beta stage, but I truly do think it has some great potential. We just have internet at our house and a Roku 3. The Chromecast will add to what we have. I have had no issues whatsoever using it both with my Android phone and a Windows 8 PC. You can now watch all those YouTube videos that could only be viewed online. Even though it's compatible with the huluPLUS app, you can now watch all those movies that are only available for online viewing right on your TV. Had no problems with Netflix but we will use the Roku for that. Soundcloud sounds wonderful on the TV. And for $35, it's a bargain. Don't be disappointed that only a few apps are compatible right now, that will change. Plus, casting from a PC adds a ton of stuff you can now watch on your TV. At the moment, the only Chromebook it is compatible with is the Pixel. Hopefully, more Chromebooks will be added. Overall, I am extremely happy with Chromecast and can't wait for more sites and apps to \\"sync up\\" with it. I strongly encourage you to contact all the developers of your favorite sites and apps and encourage them to make their product usable with Chromecast.<br /><br />Update: I swear this just happened: immediately after posting this review, I just happened to notice my Acer Chromebook has the casting extension now. This must have just happened very recently. Well, that makes me extremely happy and even a bigger fan of the Chromecast.<br /><br />2nd update: One great feature of my Acer Chromebook is that it updates itself. The Chromecast extension was automatically added. After playing with it for awhile, I have noticed that when viewing casting a video from the browser, the video is very laggy and unwatchable. Hopefully this is something Google will fix. YouTube and Netflix work great but you need to use the casting feature within the video player itself. When I did this, I had no issues other than I couldn't pause or stop the video  playing on Netflix...I had to just stop casting entirely. I did cast from within the browser while on Soundcloud and Google Music. Not really any issues there. The only glitches I experienced was when I opened another browser window just to view while casting. Soundcloud did stop but started right up again when I recasted it. Overall, I'm still happy with the Chromecast and can work around its limitations on my Chromebook....I had to just stop casting entirely. I did cast from within the browser while on Soundcloud and Google Music. Not really any issues there.

B0057F869U|4.0|Fassbender was not as compelling as he usually is; Mia was stupendous and really makes the movie. Movie's pacing and cinematography were very subtle...good...if you like that sort of thing.<br /><br />In the end it lacked a bit of oomph for me.  Fabulous everything, superb acting, except that \\"je ne sais quois\\".  Would that thing be the directing?  The Editing?  The Chemistry?  Not sure except I didn't feel the gut wrenching chemistry between these two that I've seen in some of the Jane Austen novels.

0061950726|2.0|So, here's the issue raised by this book and others like it. The book's subject is largely new to fiction--the Orphan Trains of the late 19th and early 20th century America--and is a captivating one. Does the joy in learning about this subject, and the fact that a novel leads readers into this or another unfamiliar subject  (The Language of Flowers  comes to mind) make the, or a,  novel itself good? Is it too easy to conflate the interesting premise (orphan trains) with the book itself, and do readers give writers a pass if the premise is unique, but the plotting and characterization less so? It seems that the answer is yes on both counts.<br /><br />Orphan Train  is not a terribly written novel, but it is not a great novel. The most interesting part of the book is the historical backdrop of the orphan trains and their real-life riders rather than Kline's fictional characters who rode them. The time spent reading her novel I would have preferred to spend reading about the real orphan trains, and yet paradoxically, I would not have known about this subject if not for her novel, further complicating my feelings about the book.<br /><br />The book suffers from the dual plot cliche in which as two plots spool out emerge many familiar elements that ultimately (and sometimes sooner) tie together too neatly. It also suffers from its protagonist Vivian taking an action that seems totally out of character for her and, to make matters worse, without explanation. This action goes against everything that happened to her and everything that she believed and experienced up to this point in the book. Perhaps the author wanted to darken the plot at that moment in the narrative, and felt that the more obvious plot line was too sentimental. As it was, however, because of this bizarre turn, the ending of the novel is now maudlin, so what's the difference? This plot turn lacking entirely in believability makes the book an unsatisfying read. The novelist should either rewrite the character to add credibility to Vivian's decision or keep Vivian as she is and write a more believable action sequence for her to take.<br /><br />Speaking of which, the characterization is problematic also. One of the novel's two protagonists, initially named Niamh, and then later Dorothy, is the book's only fully-formed character. That same character in later life,  Vivian (these name changes are explained in the book) is, however, completely two-dimensional as are a number of other of the book's characters including Dina, Terry, and Jack. Even Molly, the second major character in the book whose narrative entwines with Vivian's (heavy-handed symbol of this provided in case readers miss it) is created using a predictable shorthand--is every adolescent misfit a pierced and tatted &#34;Goth&#34;?  No matter, this novelist has a job to do and seems too troubled to make real some of the characters who serve merely as plot devices. Like the orphan trains themselves, this book's mission is to get where it is headed with as few stops as possible.<br /><br />In fairness to the book, I am grateful to its author for having introduced me to this part of history, but as a reader, do not find this novel to be well-written.
B0000TB014|5.0|As Michael Jackson fans, along with our granddaughter who did a ballet and rock n'roll dance in her ballet show featuring all MJ's songs, we loved seeing him in the videos and our grandson loved the &#34;Just Beat It&#34; and &#34;I'm Bad&#34; shows as well.  Seems like the video was a hit as it proved again The King of Pop still rocks!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The point of view of death as the narrator should have been frightening....yet it wasn't. Death was not portrayed as a scary figure at all.<br />This story was told in such a way that I could actually feel the angst of death taking the souls. The horror of nazi Germany was conveyed in a personal tone through the voice of death as he/ she witnessed the carnage. I felt for the characters and the writing was superb. A must read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Happy that amazon has this game and its free. I would have to go to my moms house to use their computer just to play.
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|The 4 stars is for the fact that eventually I could hardly put the book down. But this is not King at his best, and this won't be a King classic. In his favour, as always, are his well-rounded characters. One cannot help liking Dan Torrance, for example. My problem with this book was The True Knot people. I can handle any kind of fantasy, but we were not told much about these \\"non-humans\\": how long they've actually existed, or  how they came to exist at all. They seemed to have come out of thin air. Also, that \\"taking in of steam\\" was not so much fantasy and science fiction as just too unbelievable. But once the story draws you in, you have to read on to find out what happens. And that is Stephen King's greatest talent: his inimitable, irresistible writing style.<br /><br />As previous reviewers said, the ending was a slightly damp squib, but at least goodness triumphed over evil, which is as it should be.<br /><br />I have one question for Mr King, though: how can a measles germ exist in bodies for more than 2 years ... ? I won't explain that one, as I don't want to be a spoiler. Just askin' ....

1476727651|5.0|What a great read! I read The Shining over 25 years ago, and it terrified me. It's hard to top the scares in the Shining, but Doctor Sleep had frightening scenes that still linger in my mind. I loved the characters, too. You worry and root for Dan Torrance as he struggles with alcholism, and Abra Stone is an endearing, fascinating character. Their separate stories are interesting on their own, but when their lives intersect, the book gets even better. Highly recommended.
B00F1CRSKM|5.0|Purchased the vinyl from my local record store (thank God they still exist).  It sounds awesome.  Downloaded the MP3's to my iPod and I'm good to go.  Now for my thoughts.  I'm a pretty big fan of the band.  I LOVED the Suburbs record. However I was worried about this record after I heard the producer was the guy from LCD soundsystem.  My fears were exacerbated by the visual of watching Arcade Fire on SNL and Jimmy Kimmel.  Those performances were odd to say the least (what's up with puppets didn't Beck already do that and better by the way).  I guess they are trying to be artistic but it comes off to me at least visually as pretentious.  Now I was ready to hate this record after seeing the band on TV and with knowledge of who produced it.  So I placed the vinyl on the platter dropped the needle and my fears were lifted.  Arcade Fire did it again!!  Another great album from start to finish.  Love the production.  Cool use of tempo changes.  Just a beautiful record.  If you are a fan of the band and are on the fence about getting this album don't.  I'd highly recommend the Vinyl the sound is brilliant.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book touched my heart in a profound way. Shin's honesty, courage, tenacity and will to live are inspirational. I also enjoyed how the author captured his humanity and didn't try to force a &#34;happy ending&#34; with sunshine and smiles when that just isn't the way the world works.<br />I couldn't put this book down and plan to read it again many times. Thanks a million times to Shin for sharing his story!
B003G4W49C|5.0|A great, sad story about empathy, misunderstanding and, of course, the loss of innocence, all wrapped up in exciting adventure and presented through the eyes of children.
006202406X|5.0|The Divergent series by Veronica Roth is easily on par with the Hunger Games for me.  I could NOT wait to get my hands on the final installment of the series and pre-ordered it from Amazon. The book continues to fall Tris and Tobias (AKA Four, man of my dreams) on their quest for freedom and truth in the dystopian society they live in.<br /><br />In Allegiant, the factions have been dissolved, but the citizens of Chicago now find themselves slaves to a new tyrant who enforces their &#34;freedom&#34;, Tobias' own mother Evelyn. Tobias, Tris, and their friends make their way out of the city to find a surprising new world where they finally learn a truth that will change everything they believe.<br /><br />So what do I love so much about this book? So many things. Seriously.<br />1. Tris and Tobias. There is no love triangle in this series. Praise God. They have a solid relationship that faces challenges other than a third person getting in the way.... Instead they have to deal with lying, trust issues, and forgiveness. A lot of this stems from Tris' previous errors in the relationship. &#34;Remember when I teamed up with your abusive father to basically end the world as we know it?&#34; You know, the usual.  However, Tobias brings his own challenges in this book which makes it clear that they have an equal and truly loving relationship.<br /><br />2. The point of view.  Unlike the first two books which were told solely from Tris' perspective, Allegiant alternates between Tris and Tobias. This switch adds another dimension to the story-telling, and makes the resolution much more poignant.<br /><br />3. Action.  There are some great action scenes that do not drag on or distract from the story line... instead they add to the storytelling and allow us to see the true nature of our heroes.<br /><br />4. SPOILER. BIGGEST SPOILER EVER. DO NOT READ THIS SECTION. DANGER, DANGER WILL ROBINSON!!!!!<br />Are you still reading? Take a breath. Tris dies. YES. I really admire Roth'sbravery in killing off the main hero that we have rooted for over the course of three books. Honestly, it seemed like the only fitting ending. Tris finds in herself the courage to face death, even when she has so much to live for, to protect all the people that she loves. Even those that may not deserve it. She is innately good, despite the society that has tried to turn her into something else.  It turns out that she has more Abnegation in her than she maybe even thought. The last several chapters are told only from Tobias' viewpoint, which is especially touching.<br /><br />Overall, Allegiant is a beautiful, fast reading story of friendship, love, and redemption.... with a little dystopian drama thrown in for good measure. If you're into the Hunger Games or other dystopian fiction, I highly recommend this series. And make sure you start reading the first book before the movie comes out!
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|Movie is entertaining; but it is not James Bond.<br /><br />This movie betrays many of classic James Bond must-haves we grew up to expect from 007. This Bond character feels more like 1950s spy character; not the 007 of British MI6. Kind of reminds me of mission impossible movies more than of traditional James Bond movies.<br /><br />WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT<br />1. In this movie James Bond meets McGyver... Really?!? Bond is missing all the futuristic cool toys we expect from 007, so he has to improvise with minimal gear.<br />2. Bond does not get the girl!!! I have a feeling they will only be friends..<br />3. Bad guy does not have a strong sidekick... CMON it's a must have!!!!<br />4. Bad guy is not the archetype of evil that they are in other movies; he is just a bad guy.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|I loved the book, and while this movie has little to do with the book, it's a great ride and a solid story.  I stayed away from this movie in the theaters because the trailers were awful, as they focused on some computer animation techniques that make the zombies look silly, like those horrible squid things in the final Matrix movie.  You know, giant swarms of things operating in a visually appealing and yet completely nonsensical manner.<br /><br />Those scenes do exist in the movie, but they are a small part of it, and in general the zombies were well done.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|What is there to say, it is Star Trek.  However, one thing to point out is that while the first movie was sort of a reboot the second movie brought up a earlier plot from years past.  My main concern by doing this is that every movie after is going to be a similar show.  I really want to see more of their exploration and not trying to tie into T.V. shows.  So while I'm a bit disappointed in this overall the effects and movie was enjoyable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game just like the challenge of getting better at my score with all the different levels it doesn't get boring.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this app.  Screen size is great.  Addicted to Candy Crush would like a way to play as a tournament.
B00AA36RZY|5.0|This book is engaging, informative, and, dare I say, fun to read. I would highly recommend this as an introduction to Design Patterns.
0316789720|5.0|This is a good drawing book for a non-artist.  I can look good in the eyes of my grandchildren and show them how to draw things they want to draw.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is terrible!!! Click to update and it takes you to Google play?<br /><br />Is this some kind of sick joke?
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|This is a gun game, but, like most Glu games, it only lets you play a limited amount unless you want to pay actual money for &quot;energy&quot;. Graphics are nice. Gameplay is smooth. It was free. So, I got exactly what I expected.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ill go along with everyone else and just tell it like it is.  This is an awesome time passer, I got it for a great price through the Kindle so I was even more happy.  Fun game, you build, I like building.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Hey, I have been a fan of Marvel comics since I was a child. One of my childhood dreams was to have quality movies created from my favorite comic book characters. Great !!!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I would've liked to see what happened right after the departure. However, it is very interesting to get a first hand look at the inside of prison when you wouldn't otherwise know things like that really happen!
B00CR1DX9A|5.0|I liked 'Extremely England' a lot. The humor ranges from slapstick to sarcasm and everything in-between. There is a good range of characters that keep the storyline moving. A real, humorous book that had me laughing a lot.
B001224WBS|5.0|Great music, this is a place to start if you are just getting into these guys.  I have been listening for a while now and have always liked their stuff.  If you are interested in them and dont know if you will like them this is a good place to start.  It is pretty cheap and you get a lot of their best of stuff.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been a King fan for over twenty five years, read everything by him, I was a little skeptical when I heard he was doing a sequel to The Shining, I thought great another author that I love who has run out of ideas and is going back to the well. I was quite wrong. This book was great. Mr. King just seems to get better with age. The story, the connection with the past and how everything ties in was just wonderful. I really do recommend this book
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|I own a Canon Powershot SX40 camera.  The lens readily fits the lens on my Canon without buying or adding any additional fittings.  This is not a true Macro lens; it works in conjunction with the camera's built in telephoto lens, to allow the telephoto lens to focus close to objects.  The combination of the EXTENDED telephoto and DCR0250 makes a very powerful macro photographic lens system.<br /><br />For the lens to work, you must extend your built in telephoto lens; the more the camera telephoto lens is extended, the more magnified the subject.  The camera should be put into MACRO focus mode to aid in focusing, but focus is achieved by physically moving the camera back and forth.  The lens has a very narrow depth of field, and a short depth of focus. I bought a Cowboy Studios Macro Focusing Rail Set to aid focusing the camera [[ASIN:B0047DS41S Cowboystudio Macro Focusing Rail Set with 4 Way, Fine Control and Camera Focusing Rail for Macro Photography]].  I highly recommend that you invest in a 4 way focusing rail set for use with the DCR-250 lens.  I already owned a Bogen Manfrotto tripod, but I needed a sturdy tripod for tabletop use; I bought a Silk Tabletop Tripod ([[ASIN:B005OAU24K Slik Mini-pro Dq Table-top Tripod]]), which I will review.<br /><br />The lens quality is excellent.  It allows the camera to photograph microscopic details (literally).  I took a photograph of a prepared microscope slide containing a small slice of flower bud; the detail was perfect, and showed all of the organelles.  I also photographed several individual snowflakes.  I'm putting the photo of the microscope slide and snowflakes on Amazon with the DCR-250, so you can see the quality of the lens.  I took 2 photos of 2 tiny snowflakes laying together; in one photograph I focused on the flake furthest from the camera and in the other photo I focused on the near flake.  This demonstrates the short depth of focus and how critical it is to focus by moving the camera.<br /><br />The photographs of objects using the DCR-250, are crisp, detailed, and beautiful.  This Macro lens makes a welcome addition to my photographic equipment.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love that I can play on my kindle now I don't have to be on my phone and I can use my kindle more then I do now
B00C6Q6OAG|5.0|I really like these toys and my wife collects them.  It is an awesome deal if you can get it through amazon right now.  The dolls are pretty well made and you get a decent amount of stuff for the cost.  This is 21.99 and you can get it through prime right now.  Great deal for the price.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is an awesome singer with a great voice.  She has soothing, melodic voice with a wide range.  You won't be disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so much fun! Children of all ages will love it. You can groom the horse, feed it, muck the stalls and so much more...... I would recommend this app to anyone
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so fun I love unlocking new minions and the different locations think they should add the girls and gru to the game but other that I love it
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I could not say not to this.  Got it for a rocking price and it is solid.  I dont know the issue others have had but my set is really nice and is well built.  Great addition to my Blu-Ray collection.
B00DWV3NM6|5.0|Running this with an i5-4670k clocked to 4.5Ghz. At 1080 everything is a breeze. I strongly recommend either 1440p or 120Hz 1080 monitor for this GPU. You will be wasting money running a single 1080p 60Hz monitor. That being said, if you have a more demanding monitor setup, this card is great at handling it. It's a little more expensive, but the price drops (currently $519 at time of purchase) make this a wonderful card for the higher end. The cooler is awesome as well. Very quiet, and very cool. Under typical gaming, I have yet to see this thing over 60, and it typically stays around 45, even under a highly demanding game.
B008Z9L94O|2.0|I should have known better. I read the reviews and I figured, hey, I'll be one of the lucky few that gets a good copy. But no, Zero is totally f-ed. So Amazon and Smashing Pumpkins, are you going to make this right for all the Pumpkins fans that bought a $70 vinyl and got an inferior product? Love the packaging and the other discs are fine, but this issue needs to be fixed for all the people who handed Amazon and the band their hard earned money.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is awesome I'm addicted  to it I swear! Levels get tricky and challenging which is what makes a game interesting and makes me want  play
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|It was a perfeck family action movie, i loved it so much. my heart was beating really fast. my mom said that it was aswome.
0062080237|5.0|I've been following Neil Gaiman on Tumblr for years now, but I had never actually read one of his books. So I picked up a copy of American Gods, and it was abdolutely brilliant. Engaging, amusing, a deep stry and fascinatig characters. Absolutely loved it. Give it a try!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mincraft pocket edition is simply amazing. No not even that. Let's just say there are no words in the human language to express how good the game is.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|The story is no good. The eagles could have picked up the group in the beginning of the movie and dropped them of at the mountain, would have saved them lot of walking. Same comment for the Lord of the Rings.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I love this book! A well written and engaging story which is really inspiring. Yes, it is a very quick read, but although you will likely read it in a day or two (I know I did) you will be pondering your own \\"personal legend\\" afterwards and for weeks to come. I highly recommend this book!<br />Melanie Beckler, Author of [[ASIN:B00G8UVIAM Experience Angels]]
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|i can't believe i took the time to finish this book. i had read reviews likening it to 1984, which i love, and i saw the connection to a degree, so i kept going, hoping that eggers would make good on the comparison. this book does not deserve to have a masterpiece like 1984 come up in its comments. for the entirety of the book, it felt as though it was about to get really good. for about ten pages at the end it reached a high-water mark of being okay, but the vast majority of this book left me bored to tears.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|I purchased two of these books, one for my brother in law & one for my husband.  They both really enjoyed reading it and now it's my turn.  Shipped super fast and packaged well.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Enjoyable, frustrating, annoying, then \\"VOILA!\\" enjoyable again!  I find myself constantly going back to this game, and again I get frustrated when I cannot complete the grid; then smiling because I connected the tubes properly and filled the grid, and can now go on to the next grid. Amazingly simple when you begin, but as more colors appear frustration begins.
0399159347|5.0|The author delivers a great story.  The characters are well developed and I felt like I was at the Tupperware Parties and eating Hot Cross Buns dripping with butter!  I could not stop reading it!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked finding clues.  I wish it was longer .  Please make many more levels.  It is very fun and  Please make more hiding spots. Themes would  be fun too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS GAME IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE not to mention super fun and challenging. Best of all it's free! Can't go wrong with this one!
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|MOVED IT  LOVED IT LOVED IT!!!!!!<br /><br />LOVED it! I was really surprised that I liked this game so much because most of the ones I have played were a bit disappointing. It was interesting and fun!
B002A97IJ0|5.0|I wanted to run a closed loop liquid cooler and the company I was buying from said that my case wouldn't allow it to work, because of the side panel fans being in the way.. Well.. With two of the beautiful little guys, I improvised my way around the issue and now i rarely get about 40C on my CPU while running Dual Slim-Line fans.  These things are awesome and run so quiet compared to what I prepared for.  If I built another PC, I will definitely be using some more of these bad boys to keep it cool.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|If you want to know Harry, this is the must read. You will learn how he became the type of man he is and how what shaped him impacts every aspect of his life and every relationship he has, personally and professionally. Great book
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is another classic by a timeless author.  It is a good story even if you haven't read The Shining in years like me.  I couldn't hardly put it down!!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I actually spent the 99 cents to get the lollipops because I knew I could win the level. I did win the level cleared all jelly had a fantastic score and it said I failed. So I took it off my phone and kindle. I did put it back on here but I learned my lesson....I will not spend any further in app$ on this game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Such an amazing product. I can see all of my browser tabs on my TV making it super simple to use my TV as a second monitor.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I bought this CD/mp3 because I happened to hear one of his songs playing on the local radio station and I was hooked in by his unique voice and musical sound.. I'm glad I did because I just love this entire CD.. His singing voice is truly outstanding and the musical genius of his songwriting stands out in each song.. It's become one of my newest favorites and after this purchase I've since gone on to buy two more of his music titles.. I'm a brand new fan of Passenger..
B0061S073A|5.0|Until we are able to replace her Fire and set up Free Time, this is a great alternative when she uses my Kindle.
B005LAII08|5.0|A great story for little girls.  Some of the bear scenes could be a little scary for young kids.  My daughter now wants a now and arrow set.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|This os a wonderful opportunity To acquire am excelente séc  Roth for muito kindel's. Ir relieves worry Officejet Baby vírus T9 cause harm T9 muito files.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Excellent CD!  A friend bought this for me, and I liked it so much that it was the first thing that came to mind when buying a gift for someone else!  It's anointed worship that is sure to encourage you and take you deeper in your walk with God!
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This works for connecting my old legacy firewire audio interface (MOTU 828 mk II) to my macbook pro.  I also use a 9-pin to 6-pin firewire cable.  Everything works smoothly.
B00GBQI0M2|5.0|I loved this intense little burst of vampyrism that reminded my of early Ann Rice. Like every good short story there is a twist. It's also very sexy.  Scarlette D'Noire writes seductively and with purpose. Every word feels like it belongs. I am looking forward to delving into more stories by this talented author.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|If you like French songs, you will enjoy Notre Dame of Paris! Amazing Performance! I even downloaded songs on my phone and listen to it when I am driving.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is still the all-time best version of Pride and Prejudice that I've seen.  It honors the integrity of the book while creating a great film experience.  Can't beat it!
B002DEZXOE|5.0|Crazy about Woodstock. Crazy about this video I wish I was born a generation earlier because the 60's were FAR OUT!!!!!:) peace.
B002T9H2LK|4.0|It was a good movie, not as great as I had hoped, but who knows, in my mind, I may have rated it higher than I should have.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Enjoy the game despite the overly cartoon-y graphics. No energy meters are a nice touch for a change but the difference in pricing between players is a bit odd. (Gf and I both reached level 7 the red Dragon was 750 crowns for her but 1000 for<br />me.)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game has been a real enjoyment for me. Love the puzzles and the story line that goes along with it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|it's cute but it does have a really high price range. all I have to say. is ripoff sort of
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is awesome you parents should let your kids and let you get this game.and this is from a 89 year old.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|My favorite stories are the ones where the underdog triumphs in the end. Reminiscent of &#34;The Shawshank Redemption,&#34; this story held my attention so much I read it virtually nonstop in two days. Can't wait for the movie!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game. Easy and not stressful. We all love it at puff house is suitable for all ages you must pay.
B00A44HRG2|5.0|Its so awesome get this app now can spy on people I was surprised when it worked.I love this app.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a fun app.  It has helped me figure out what Wi-Fi's are available around my house and while traveling.  It is fascinating to ride in a car (don't do this while driving!!!) and watch the various Wi-Fi networks come and go.  What blows my mind is that at work there are at least 3 at any one time.  I work in a huge building that has no work related Wi-Fi, so this means people must have hot spots near me.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|Equilibrium<br /><br />I've read some reviews and it seems I ran across a set of them who may be taking an exam in film criticism.  Not so fancy here.  I liked it. But let me play a bit...<br /><br />It started and dragged on for some time before I felt any action was taking place. A couple times I almost shut it off... there are lots of movies to watch, I would not want to waste any time on movies that are going to start and end on a yawn.<br /><br />Fortunately, I stuck it out.  You'll recognize the plot without effort, it is how we get to the climax and conclusion that we hope will surprise us.  Ray Bradbury would be proud of this outing of one of his notable plots.<br /><br />I think too much I suppose.  The whole emotion thing brought back John Hurt in the movie of George Orwell's 1984.  Perhaps we even have a hint of Body Snatchers with Donald Sutherland pointing and screeching at the end of the movie at those who are different.  In this movie, “the different” are people who feel.  Sensors, Sensers... Whatever they're called, You get the idea.  The bad people who feel and cause wars and conflict.<br /><br />Enter Prozac Nation, and the 3rd Reich complete with an Adolf Hitler substitute to make sure everyone is on drugs to kill all sensations? Feelings?, etc., And then enjoy Pol Pot's indoctrination or 'retraining camps” except those were real and here it is just fiction to groom the population into Milo's (Phantom Tollboth) Doldrums.<br /><br />Well thank goodness this utopian? distopian? movie springs a leak with one of the “Terminator” substitutes called clerics.  Kind  of cool, the idea... I mean, “cleric” is the super SS trooper killing machine. It has a spiritual overtone and I think that is a nice creative twist.<br /><br />Then you're in for some some jaw dropping super special effects eye candy.  John Preston (Christian Bale) in this movie is no Neo (Keanu Reeves ) from Matrix, but they had the same “movie mother.”<br /><br />Ok, I'llstop being a dweeb like so many reviews I have read.  I liked it.  Really.  You'll need a little patience as the movie intentionally unfolds slowly.  The action scenes are really cool, but being ex-military I promise you it's all cinema magic.<br /><br />You might enjoy this move if you want to settle down with some popcorn for the slow uptake of the move.  Hopefully, before the popcorn is gone you'll be rewarded with an exciting bunch of scenes leading to the hooray of the movie...<br /><br />I'm giving 4 stars.  Start with 5, knock one off for the slow start, maybe kick another one almost off the board for several reasons that will be self evident, but leaving the 4th star because in the end it is a character driven science fiction movie with character growth and change.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is fun you level up quickly but they should put more songs to dance to. still it's a great game I love it.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This is the legitimate terraria game for the kindle. It's like minecraft but it is just as fun. It's a little difficult in the beginning but once you get into it its addicting to play. I highly recommend this game it's worth every dollar.
B007TVANDM|5.0|This book and song were used in a summer school classroom for second and third graders who were very behind grade level in there reading skills. The children loved Pete the Cat story and especially its up lifting song. After the school session ended, many student were heard around our smallish village singing Pete's song. What a fun way to instill the love of reading!
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|I've always been a fan of August Burns Red so I may be slightly biased. Many of these songs have changed from their previously heavier metal. This is not a bad thing though. They have achieved a perfect balance of technical proficiency, thrash worthy metal, & passionate vocals with lyrics that truly bring out their message.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is far too addicting for my own good. I play it periodically throughout the day.  It just irritates me when I run out of lives.
0345803507|5.0|Awesome ending to a trilogy i only wish there were more books. love this author and the books. Hopefully more to come.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is  a fun game but I don't like the energy thing could have access more guns except having spend real cash for them
B003WUYRGI|5.0|it was okay who needs a dictionary we have a dictionary.  well it was ok l i did not like it
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love it is a great game for gun fans. I love the lowed out its good for<br />Every one
B008MEM24S|1.0|This is a fun game but all you get for 99 cents is the first chapter.  After that it's $2.99 to continue with more levels.  It took me less than an hour to get to that point.  Disney should just charge more upfront or call this a demo version.
B0035XQW74|5.0|Gerard Butler goes from loving innocent person to a ruthless, calculating killer.  What a ride.  I was GLUED to this movie and not only by Gerard's rugged good looks.  The movie is actually a must watch.  I'm ordering the disc for my library
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you. Waited a whole year. Need to keep up Kindle/Amazon. I was almost going to sell kindle and go with competitor but I didn't. I waited and here it is.woooowoooo
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Awsome book.I think it had a lot of irony and action in it with a suspense sprinkled on the top
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|Whell I liked it on the computer and I like it on tablet to so I recommend this game to every one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is quick and easy to use I would use this for homework too when I am allowed. its right there at you fingertips.  when I travle places with my kindle fire I can use it for prices because the calculator works quick and easy with many equations -
B00BWJARHO|3.0|My mom really wanted to watch it and didn't want to pay for a DVD. Unfortunately she didn't want to pay for HD either so we were stuck with a poor quality video. Great story though!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really enjoy playing for hours. The different levels make playing this game with my grandsons of different ages just right for each one of them. They enjoy the time we spend together building life long memories. Thanks for making my time spent with them possible.
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|Despicable me was a fun movie to begin with and Depicable me 2 continues to build on a great theme, of caring for family.  The humor, minions, and genetic mutation plot clashes good with evil and is put into a comical scenario where the minions become the evil army.  However, the doctor, decides to side with family against the evil aztec villain and an anti-serium is mixed with the failed jelly product from their market enterprise.  an anti-serium reverses the affects of the evil minions returning them to corporate minions.<br /><br />The cast is delightful. There is teenage romance and adult romance.  The fatherly competition to protect the daughter made me laugh. It reminded me of Momma mia in the parallels of love in the generations.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|Nice addition to Kindle. Like being able to make list, add to it and then email.Versatile, easy to use and self explanatory.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game. Very good graphics. The only down side to the game is the fact that you have to spend real money to finish most levels.
0262731541|5.0|Concise, factual approach to almost everything about bicycling. I had read reviews but was still not prepared for the detailed information this book contains. Bravo!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Allegiance was worth the read, but just not quite as good as the first two in the series....and just once, couldn't it have ended like we wanted?! Gah
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|For all of us who needed some shining closure, this delivers in true King style and punch. He is the master of horror/thriller genre.
B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|Outmove (The Inner Movement) Book 3 by Brandt Legg, is like finding a twenty in your pocket when broke! I LOVED IT! Although I seem to be one of the minority that hasn't &#34;yet&#34; read the first two books of this three book series. The great news is I was able to jump right in without missing a beat. Take note I will go back and read the others!<br /><br />This story reads smoothly, not forced and the character traits ring believable and connective, powerful, inspiring. It's obvious the author wrote with passion because, evident in his words. You can't help but relate and become emotionally interconnected. To want to learn and read more. &#34;Spiritual Awakening&#34; versus &#34;Omnia.&#34; Good versus evil. The never-ending battle contemplating spiritual synergies, death, the afterlife, souls, the factual power of the mind. I can't even begin to understand how Legg created such an &#34;enlightening&#34; plot and story.

B000FC1JCQ|3.0|Too much graphics on the incestuous sex.  GAH!  It's just.........ulgh!  But the story still is interesting.  King Arthur's origin story is neat.
0345525558|5.0|I loved this book - well written and the story line hit home with me - there were points in this book that actually brought tears and then happiness. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to read a book that involves true issues but a story line that keeps you engaged all through to the end. I would read this author again but I see that she has not written another book yet.

B009LDD5E0|5.0|All the music and interaction I remembered enjoying throughout the past season.  My only complaint was the SHIPPING EXPERIENCE.  I didn't pay for the upgraded service and was made to wait a RIDICULOUS amount of time BEYOND my expected due date of delivery.  This has never happened to me before.  The delivery was at least a week plus over .  Not good business,
B00CH87HF4|4.0|fun game to pass time and easy to learn i suggests everyone pick it up jkgffjgfds ghjjkjb hhhjj jiuggvb hhhg
B004KKXMSI|4.0|(mine was sold by \\"region-free titles\\")I bought this with a little hast and did not realize it was a NON region-1 disk.  Mine looks exactly as the pictures here. It does not say either way or in any way of what region it is anywhere on the packaging or even on the disk (though i believe this to be a U.K. disk. BUT this DOES work in my player. All my gear is normal U.S. equipment. It came brand new and shrink-wrapped in perfect condition. The movie in general is grainy, sometimes VERY grainy.  I know grain can mean a more pure, refined, and more thoroughly remastered picture.... but when it is SO grainy that when a stationary object seems to be moving.... it is very distracting and annoying. I do not know what the stand-alone region #1 blu-ray looks like, but this region free version is quite grainy. Not every scene, but probably 50% of it. For me, for all 3 titles $22 is worth it. and if you are wondering about the audio, my receiver tells me what audio its being fed, and it says \\"DTS-HD master audio\\".  so this is the real deal and should work in U.S. players, it is just too grainy too often for my taste.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is wonderful but so addictive so beware.  I have it on my laptop,notebook, and phone so I play it everywhere all the time.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Great book, very motivating. A must read that will put in perspective your life and how the 'elite' are in some ways like us but also explains the tools to possibly be like them too.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|it is awesome but some of the levels are really annoying. I suggest you get it if you like hard levels and stuff.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Best show on television and this season lives up to the usual clever, witty, yet devastating stories that are the hallmark of this outstanding quality production.  The ensemble cast is unforgettable, and tragically ignored by well-deserved awards for their remarkable efforts - the characters are unique and fascinating; the roles are exceptional and the actors both terrific and lucky to play them.  Emmys should be flocking towards this show!  Kudos to everyone from actors to writers to production team.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a really good game but it is hard too. I really like it and wish i had more harts.

B009VIZDLI|5.0|I stopped reading many times to tell my husband parts of the book. Too funny!<br /><br />The main character, Don see the world in simple terms and part of the books appeal its idealism.<br /><br />Simple, charming and a riot to boot.

B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great movie. Nothing better than high fantasy either books or movies. Well made well acted. Wonderful special effects. Great Movie
006202406X|2.0|SPOILERS – LOTS AND LOTS OF SPOILERS<br /><br />‘Allegiant‘ was so incredibly bad, and the ending was the least of it.<br /><br />A lot of the things I had problems with have already been mentioned in other reviews, but I have to put my own spin on things.<br /><br />First, what the heck was going on with Four and Tris? Did they have a ‘Freaky Friday’ moment and switch personalities, because seriously, Four was a whiny little girl. There were several times where I just wanted to yell at him to change back to the character I knew in ‘Divergent’ and ‘Insurgent‘. If this was supposed to be character development, well, it didn’t work. And Tris went to being one of the most selfish, self-serving characters I’ve read in some time. I know I was supposed to believe she was selfless, but I didn’t. Sorry. But not really.<br /><br />And the deaths?  I know its war time, but I seriously think the author was in a bad mood when she wrote those scenes because she killed almost everyone off, except the villains I noticed. Seriously, bad people do die in war too. They don’t get to take memory serums and live out their lives as if nothing ever happened. That part was just insanely bad.<br /><br />Okay, so another thing was the duo voices. And this is part of the reason why I don’t think it was edited very much and if it was, it wasn’t done very well. Tris and Four’s voices were identical. In fact, if it hadn’t been for the character saying ‘Tris’ or ‘Tobias’ I would have had to check to see whose chapter it was. And, as together as they were in the first two books, they were apart in this one.<br /><br />In ‘Allegiant‘,  Tris and Tobias’s relationship seemed almost forced. There wasn’t the same connection. I know they kissed a lot, but they never seemed to talk to each other the same. There were scenes where there were serious issues between them and instead of talking it out, they spoke for five seconds and then made out.<br /><br />Then there was the info-dumping and the introduction of genetics. That introduced a whole new lot of problems for me. I was so disappointed that all the fantastic adventure and fun I had with the other two books came down to ‘damaged’ genetics. That’s what it all boiled down to? That some people didn’t have perfect genes and didn’t think or act in the same ways as those who did, therefore they had to be confined in some kind of massive mental hospital, which just happened to be the city of Chicago? Isolated, watched and experimented on in the hopes they become ‘better.’ Yeah.<br /><br />I know a lot of people have mentioned the ending over and over again. And I have to agree with them. I didn’t mind Tris dying, but it was the senseless, unrealistic way it was done. I know that I was supposed to get into the reasoning behind her decision to die, but all I felt was that Tris had a self-serving Martyr complex about her.<br /><br />The sad reality is I didn’t get emotionally invested in Tris’s death at all. It didn’t mean a single thing to me, because the way it was done was butchered. It was so unrealistic that I could have cried. She survived the death serum and then got shot? The same character who had survived several attacks on the compound? I would have believed in her death more, if she were killed in enemy crossfire.<br /><br />As for the mission they had getting into the building. I didn’t buy that either. You’re dealing with a world that can decide what memories you keep or lose, but they didn’t have or couldn’t invent a device that cracks codes or a powerful portable vacuum unit that could suck in and contain all the death serum? And Tris was running about in a war-torn country and she wasn’t carrying a gun? When she had been just chapters before? Too many variables for this death to be even remotely realistic.<br /><br />If you’re going to kill a main character off at least give it a realistic edge.<br /><br />Now don’t misunderstand me. I can appreciate sad endings when they’re done well. ‘The Faults in Our Stars’ by John Green was done well. It was realistic and I could see it happening.  It quickly became one of my favorite books.  ‘Sever’ by Lauren DeStefano was also another book where my favorite character had a sad ending, but that was bittersweet because instead of his ending coming to him surrounded by four walls, he had a chance to live. It made his ending special.<br /><br />All Tris’s death taught me is that a person can go through hell and back and that’s it’s just a waste of time, because the bad person is still going to win anyway. She should have just died with that first initial jump in ‘Divergent’ for all her death meant to me in this book.<br /><br />Another thing that got to me about this book is that parents, ones that love and care about you, would not wish death upon you. The idea that a child would choose to die just because they think it would end up honoring the parent needs psychiatric help. Because that’s about as far from the truth as a person can get. Tris’s parents would have wanted her to live, especially when she had someone to live for.<br /><br />So all I get out of this is that Tris didn’t love Four, because if she had she wouldn’t have done what she had. She had her own agenda – one that instead of being selfless was actually one of the most selfish things I’d ever read. She didn’t give a damn about the people she left behind as long as she got to be the martyr. Everything’s for the greater good after all. It wasn’t like there wasn’t someone else willing to do it, regardless of their reasons, was there? No?  Oh, wait, I believe there was someone else who would have done it.<br /><br />Ha-ha I’m raging and I know it, but seriously there was no point to this character’s death apart from the author writing it that way. Senseless. Pointless. Meaningless. Weak.<br /><br />Anyway, I couldn’t help, but write alittle ditty. Inspired by ‘Billy, don’t be a Hero‘ by Paper Lace. It’s a chorus and the ending of that song – only I’ve called it ‘Tris, don’t be a Hero.’  Somehow I thought it was fitting.<br /><br />Tris, don’t be a hero<br />Don’t be a fool with your life<br />Tris don’t be a hero<br />Come back and make Four the happiest guy (sorry that line a bit of a squash compared to the song)<br />And as Tris started to go<br />Four said, “Keep your pretty head low.”<br />Tris don’t be a hero<br />Come back to me…<br /><br />I heard there was supposed to be a reason<br />That explained why Tris died that day<br />The author wrote it as if Tris was a hero<br />We should be proud she died that way<br />I heard some readers threw the series away…
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James Altucher's unflinching honesty about his depression, obsessive behaviour and other personal issues is disarming, as he examines how he earned and then lost millions of dollars in the financial world. More importantly, he explains why the job for life is gone forever, and how we need to choose ourselves, because nobody else will take care of us. This book took my breath away and encouraged me to go out and find what I need to do to choose myself, rather than waiting for someone else to choose me.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Great sci-fi movie. Lots of fighting, yelling and killing. Monsters against giant robots. Film quality was great. CD was perfect

B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a great game of you want something quick and not too engrossing. You can pick it up and turn it off with out having to &quot;finish the level&quot;. I have used it many times when waiting at an appointment.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have the read the whole series and I couldn't stop reading the entire time. This book had the most detail I have ever read in a book. It kept you interested the entire time and I never lost interest. I really recommend this book to anyone no matter what genre you actually like!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I loved this book!  I felt like I was reading the Stephen King of old (Carrie, It, Salem's Lot, etc.). I am a long time King fan and frankly have been disappointed with some of his newer works, but this one took me back to the writing style that made him a household name. I would have given it a 4.5 if I could, only because I felt the ending had the potential to be more, and was a little more anticlimactic than I expected. Overall, though, a very enjoyable read that was hard to put down once started.
0062073567|2.0|Two stars because I found two good ideas in this mystery, perhaps worthy of a short story but never a novel. Biggest mystery of all in this tale is how it won the Crime Writers Association 2013 poll as Whodunnit Best Ever Novel of all time! Believe me, it is naive, unconvincing and implausible. Furthermore, a fatal flaw in the plot kills it stone dead as an acceptable whodunnit.<br />What is Agatha Christie's error? I'm not giving anything away (it's in the story) in pointing out . . . because the killer left the window open, the killer could have returned undetected to the murder scene at any time, making the whole complex mind-boggling schemozzle unnecessary.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have just completed 10 levels and so far the game has not disappointed me. The puzzles are engaging and at the same time not too complicated. Not bad for a free app.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Amazing. Kept me reading because I couldn't figure it out in the beginning where it was headed, but I'm happy with how it went. For a minute I almost thought he would change his mind.
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|So far I've read only the first 3 books in this series, but I wanted to review each book on it's own merit rather than the series as a whole. This is not easily done with this particular series however, as Erikson weaves a long in depth tale which slowly spans multiple volumes.<br /><br />The first book is intricate and in depth. Being the shortest book of the series(first books often are for publication reasons.)it is understandable how a reader, who is accustomed to neat and tidy stories, may quickly feel overwhelmed with places, characters, world building, and more scene changes than most authors dare to tackle. Erikson's prose, his wording and phrasing, are also not the easiest to become accustomed too. But be patient, because there is a payoff. The world and those within it, their history, their roles, etc., become clearer in time. For the impatient, it will take too much time. Eventually you will get to know the characters and their various thoughts, meanderings and migrations in a way often not accomplished in novel writing. This can have a downside in the series early, as you will not be treated to the deep story of one or two main characters, but a more shallow summary of many. So in book one, character development may feel forced. A handful begin to stand out none the less, and you will enjoy the short time you have with them, even more so as the series continues since these characters, along with others, are given far more detailed attention in later volumes.<br /><br />I did enjoy this book but there is no option for 3.5 stars, which is what I would rate it. In the end I gave it 3 instead of 4 because it will be, and was for me, often confusing for a first volume in a series which I feel should be an easier read as we attempt to orient ourselves with a very unique high fantasy series.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This story deserves to be read on an iPad. Steve Jobs is the genius of our generation & is to frequently misunderstood. That being said , we should all crank up our personal Reality Distortion Field.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|These headphones were my first good pair of full-size headphones, but I've owned the Shure SE215 IEMs for a long time now. Wow! These headphones sound incredible across the entire frequency spectrum, frequently exposing new details in songs I've heard a hundred times. Also, the open-back design does allow for a very large soundstage. As someone who is used to noise-cancelling IEMs, this was an adjustment, but a worthwhile one. I have to say though, if you truly want to hear the full value of these cans, use them with a DAC like the Fiio E07K.I just got one about a week ago, and it just multiplies all of the incredible characteristics of these headphones. In conclusion, these headphones are a VERY worthwhile investment and will change the way you hear your favorite songs. Happy shopping!
0062238868|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It gives one a real insight into the life of a Navy SEAL.  It is absolutely amazing what the SEALS are put through to be America's premier warriors.  It is a loss to the country that Chris was killed by one of his own.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The book is a page turner, but there are too many evokes in the too clever scheme. One two three
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It's a roller coaster of feelings... Really loved how things turned up for Ana and Fifty! I certainly wasn't expecting to hear again from JACK, I think I can be counted In the ones who have under estimated him I thought Elena was to blame for the accident it's being fun I'm finish here an purchasing the next book. I can only say THANKS! To the writer .....
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|This is my second favorite Jane Austen movie adaptation, next to Sense and Sensibility. When trying to figure out why (it's taken some critical hits because it isn't exactly like the book, and the director inserts some Jane Austen biography and [anti-slavery] politics into it), I've decided it's because of the superb casting. The actors bring the material to life in just the right way. Love, love, love.
B003B02O0A|5.0|By far, this was my favorite John Grisham book.  Having readi, I have to say that the movie was perfectly cast.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This is deeply overrated as a technology. Works very poorly and clashes with the other wifi devices in the home. Makes me sad.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|These are the most fun puzzles ever. Only problem is the go by so fast. I love them. Have all the free ones and several of the ones that are priced. They are worth it.
B006OAB2XO|5.0|very great album and wonderful to listen to, Grimes is definitely a rising talent. Definitely an artist that requires a taste in music.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I both produce music (going on 10 years now) and of course... listen for pleasure. I take hi-fidelity sound seriously both in the studio and out, and when I bought these I was looking for headphones with the flattest most true, frequency response & overall best sound for the best possible price.<br /><br />I did extensive research before purchasing these phones. I went to guitar center and tried a pair of aka k240s & audio technics agh-m45s which are some of the sony 7506's main competitors.<br /><br />These sonys just BLEW me away and there was simply no competition from the others I tried. The sound coming out of these is so incredibly accurate & clear, I can hear every detail in any piece of music like I've never heard before, and CONTRARY to what some reviewers have said these do not sound \\"cold\\" or \\"analytical\\", that is just silly nonsense. These phones are also the warmest most natural sounding that I've heard, they just glow. The sales rep at guitar center is also a music producer, he owns an $800 set of original beats headphones, I was so impressed with the sonys I told him he just had to hear these (he hadn't yet) he said \\"wow I never heard headphones that sounded like that, they sound better than my $800 beats\\". I think he felt like he spent a little too much at that point : P<br /><br />These really do sound as good if not better than some phones 2 - 3 - 6x the cost<br /><br />Perfect for any application, producing music, or pure listening pleasure, everything in the music is just so clear, each instrument is recognizable and defined through the entire frequency spectrum. I'm 100% extremely happy with this purchase, I'm in love with them.<br /><br />I've seen people write reviews with very INNACURATE info on this product saying that the mids and highs are over pronounced or that these phones are \\"bright\\", to clear up this misinformation and spread the truth once and for all, heres a link to an actual graph of the frequency response of these head phones:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />incredibly the most accurate and flat response I've seen on any headphone yet, just check out other graphs on that site for some other headphones, you'll see that most other headphones are designed to sell by creating the illusion of fuller sound by simply increasing the bass response and dropping off the highs. If you ask me thats a pretty weak attempt to make headphones sound better.<br /><br />These sonys are incredibly true and accurate and they achieve better sound through quality engineering rather than just boosting the bass. So anyone saying that these are bright and the mids and highs are pronounced is simply used to listening to bass heavy headphones with a colored frequency response which are abundant in the market.<br /><br />Enough said, you could buy em right this second and you'll never... ever regret it, you'll probably even thank me. But go to an audio store and listen for yourself side by side with other comparable phones, If you're an audiophile like me, you will be very impressed with these, if not amazed, as a matter of fact I've been wearing them while writing this entire review.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|What can I say other than this is a great action movie. I've watched it before and enjoyed it as much or more viewing it a second time. It's one of those movies that you discover new nuances with each viewing. To me, that's the mark of a movie worth watching over and over again. I'm not going into the plot. I'm sure other reviews have already performed the &#34;spoiler&#34; function, other than saying Liam Neeson does a great job of taking his place up there with Steven Segall, Chuck Norris and all the other actors who've played &#34;kick-butt&#34; heroes.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Not much to add to what has already been said here, but i'll give it a shot. I was a casual Stryper fan in the 80's. I always respected them as a band, but couldn't get past the overly slick '80's production.<br /><br />Fast forward to now. I have seen them on the last two monsters of rock cruises, which was the first time I've seen them live. Every song was 100% better live. They are a great live band, period. This album is a great hard rock/metal album, period. The production is better than anything they've done before, and the songs flat out rock. It doesn't matter how you feel about their religious beliefs, because this cd doesn't come off as preaching at all. It is just a great rock album. If this doesn't convince you how good this band is, and in particular what a great singer Michael sweet is, then check out The Covering. Look at the set list. The fact that he can pull off songs by the greatest singers of all time represented there says it all.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|GREAT free game awesome on kindle fire hd got to try not much in to hunting games an have been playing for hour
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really enjoy this game even though it drives me crazy at times.  I love being able to play it on my kindle fire.  My only complaint would be that when friends send gifts other than lives they don't show up unless I use my computer to play.  For example when I get the 3 extra moves I can't use it on the kindle because it does not show it available but it shows it on the computer. If you can fix this I would change my 4 star rating to 5.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|If you read the Divergent series then you must read the end story.  I have to admit I cried for Tris and Tobias.  The whole series is very good.  This is at least a read it twice series for me!
B0026772N8|5.0|While the book is basically a warning of the potential risk of obsessing over such an idea, in small doses, I've found it to be an interesting concept to ponder in one's downtime. Furthermore, a lot of the perspectives, insights, and discourse preluding to his philosophical climax (e.g. his description of the scientific method, his discussion on caring about what one does, and description of gumption and value traps) are brilliantly worded and have really helped shape the way that I think about life.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, and strongly recommend it to anyone interested in challenging their perspective.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing this game but unfortunately in mine it has glitches. Like in level 66 I can save as many ingredients as I want it won't let me advance. Otherwise great game! :)
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This story was full of surprises, little unexpected twists and turns that held the imagination beautifully.  A story that was sometimes sad, sometimes morbid but also compassionate and to all of us who have come to appreciate life's intricacies and complexities, it was deeply inspirational.

1439170916|5.0|The best non fiction book I have ever read. I am a student of medicine and I cannot tell you how much exposure I gained reading this, regardless of my past knowledge. Dr Mukherjee's novel seamlessly integrates science, history, policy, politics and the human connection.  Looking back as he has done will undoubtedly provide insights into the future on how to beat the family of diseases known as cancer. The book gets seriously technical sometimes but not without reason. I highly recommend to who is curious cancer, has a loved one who has struggled with it or anyone looking for a great read!  You will not be disappointed.
B0000028M7|5.0|The second studio album from Seattle’s Alice In Chains is unmistakably the group’s finest hour, and not only that, but also a true landmark release on the heavy metal timeline. Equal parts Sabbath-inspired sludge metal, crunchy stoner metal, hard rock, and Nineties grunge, “Dirt” possesses a sound that is absolutely unique, innovative, and original. And it is a record that would also prove to be one of the most important of the 1990’s, as it would go on to inspire countless imitators (see: Black Label Society, Staind, etc.), and even some bold-faced clones (Puddle Of Mudd, Godsmack, et al).<br /><br />The highlights on this fine album are abundant. Its handful of hit singles, the churning “Them Bones,” the dreary, acoustic-guitar based (at least for the most part) ballad “Down In A Hole,” the classically catchy “Rooster,” “Angry Chair,” and the closing “Would?”, are five obvious noteworthy mentions. But the standouts certainly and by any stretch of the imagination do not stop there. “Dam That River” is a surprisingly heavy big riff-rocker, and a full on heavy metal song, as is the surprisingly up-tempo “Sickman,” which has energetic and meaty metal riffing coursing through its veins. And the neighbor to the first of these two songs (“Dam That River”), “Rain When I Die,” is also of particular note, as it is a bass-heavy piece complete with an excellent bass intro, and a dirty, heavy, and grungy-sounding bass grumble flowing throughout. It also boasts wailing vocals and insanely hooky, “wah-wah” guitar licks that evoke classic Tom Morello and Jimi Hendrix.<br /><br />Elsewhere, a big, Black Sabbath-y sludge/doom metal riff comes lumbering in and smashing through the mix in “Junk Head”; and similarly, the album’s title song is another cut of trippy, droning, moaning stoner metal. “Dirt” then continues this “tripped-out” approach by opting to include “God Smack,” and filling it with weird, effects-laden vocals, wavering and quivering vocal hooks, solid, grumbling bass lines, and catchy, wah-tinged guitar leads. And on the more traditional side of the line, a ripping guitar solo is also included in this song. And then we are treated to “Iron Gland,” a really weird, forty-three-second long track. But despite it being just a quirky little interlude, “I.G.” is definitely still worth at least one listen. And lastly if far from leastly, the disc is rounded out by “Hate To Feel,” a lesser-known, but still absolutely important track that is compliments a Black Sabbath-lifted riff with a sturdy bass bottom, and a terrific, partially jazzy and partially whammy-bar-drenched, but always totally air-guitar-able solo that wails away like there’s no tomorrow.<br /><br />Frankly speaking, folks: It does not get much more essential than “Dirt,” a musical milestone, a classic release that would prove to be one of the best and most important products of the Seattle music scene, and an incredibly satisfying feast for everybody that just so happens to be into hard rock and/or alternative metal.vocals, wavering and quivering vocal hooks, solid, grumbling bass lines, and catchy, wah-tinged guitar leads.

B00881VLCE|4.0|Put this on my Kindle for times I just want to relax. I've never been much of a puzzle person, but I'm really enjoying this app. Do wish you could change the background where the pieces sit - hard to see when the picture colors are also dark.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|LOVE this movie!!! Saw this many, many years ago and bought it on VHS. It's entertaining for the whole family so now we have it on DVD! :-)
B004132I20|5.0|I usually hate Sherlock Holmes redo's, especially contemporary ones (like &#34;Elementary&#34;, which is a poor shadow of this). This is very different. &#34;Holmes&#34; and &#34;Watson&#34; (Cumberbatch and Freeman) are wonderful actors. They inject just the right amount of humor, without ever overworking anything, and work flawlessly together. The ingenious way one gets to see what Holmes is thinking is wonderful! No need for boring exposition, the plots move like greased lightening. Everything is great and leaves one panting for the next episode. The writing is fantastic and a lot of care went into this series to give proper reverence to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original work without redoing it. Next to impossible but they have done it.<br /><br />I won't talk about individual episodes because I hate spoilers. Suffice it to say the pilot episode is one of the best I have ever seen and the series just keeps getting better from there.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This is such a wonderfully absurd story told in such a restrained way that it is a joy to read. The Swedes seem to excel in these convoluted, multi-layered plots; massively implausible yarns told with such a straight face you that you just have to believe them. And some dark humour thrown in too. I loved it and I really cared about what happened to them all in the end. I wanted them to get away with their crimes. When I finished it I immediately looked to see if Jonas Jonasson had written anything else. Sadly he hasn't. Used up all his energy on this gorgeous story.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|While awaiting the arrival of my Chromecast, I read all the reviews.  I had almost decided to return it without opening, but thank goodness, I didn't.  It works perfectly.  Picture me, lazing back in my recliner with a beautiful, full screen picture with closed captioning so easy to read and being easily controlled by my Acer A200 android tablet.  I can't believe the picture quality compared to receiving off Dish through my DVR.  I need both CC and earphones....my earphones won't work through the tablet but come through the TV, so I just plugged in my headphones in the TV and I'm all set.  Here's hoping everyone else likes it, also.  It was easy to set up ... I followed directions that came on the screen...I already had Netflix streaming plan...so after allowing the updates, downloads, finding the WiFi, etc....I just used my tablet to go to Netflix and to my Wish List and up in the corner, pressed on the screen symbol.  The choice of how to watch came on the screen and I chose Chromecast.  I'm thrilled with the product and the packaging it arrived in.  Very nice for only $35.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I loved the original castleville, and hated that my kindle couldn't play flash games, so this is perfect! Also, a great time killer, so there's that.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|its free fun and educational. way better than paying $300 for it. I feel like it has polished my rusted Spanish and opened doors to new languages.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Starts slow and merely &#34;interesting&#34;. Builds to a crescendo of spiritualism and mysticism. Brilliant. Just finding this book was a fortuitous moment; a little, and wonderfully enthusiastic, independent bookshop in Grantown-on-Spey, Scotland!
B005721W9O|5.0|A fun movie when you just want to be entertained.  It takes you places that you did not expect and brings home  a life changing experience for each of the stars.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I'm enjoying this game but I feel you need to buy crowns to get anywhere fast. I don't buy crowns so it will take a while to move up levels.
1449410243|4.0|this was a book that my friend purchased for a friend of hers..She said that it was so good and you don't have to be a cat lover to read this book.  Very well written.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is such a stunning musically presented love story wrapped in corruption, jealousy and envy. Music, dancing, costuming and casting is outstanding. Performances by Nicole Kidman & Ewan McGregor perfect!
0316322407|5.0|Beautiful pictures and well written  story. This is a gift for a world traveler that my friend has known for 50 years. They were chums in college.  This lady is in final stages of cancer and my friend wanted to get this book for her and it has arrived in excellent time. Thank you so much for the great service.  That is why I gave it a 5 star
B0014YPEI4|5.0|The Papo Allosaurus is one of Papo's best dinosaurs with outstanding detail, a striking action pose and relatively good size (approximately 9\\" long). Until I got the Papo Running Tyrannosaurus, the Allosaurus was my favorite Papo dinosaur.<br />The model, particularly the head, reminds me of the Ray Harryhausen dinosaur in THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS.
B00514HDNW|5.0|This story for me was extremely well written and intriguing. The last survivor of the human race that is really pure human struggles with his situation while surrounded my enemies out of ancient legends. He is alone in the world and his mentality finds it difficult to just surrender and give up. His actions are geared to survive and actually fight back against his enemies. He is the last of an old race and he suddenly realizes that evil kills evil.  He realizes that he has become legend for the new race being born.....<br /><br />I throughly enjoyed this book and the story was well written.  It kept me focused to read it and I could hardly put it down. It is an excellent vampire story and one that you have to read.
B008B4KVS8|4.0|ICE STATION ZEBRA is based on the Alistair Maclean novel. Its fans include reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes and director John Carpenter (HALLOWEEN, THE THING).<br />It was originally supposed to star Gregory Peck and David Niven who had starred in THE GUNS OF NAVARONE which was also based on an Alistair MacLean novel, but due to lengthy script rewrites, when the movie was ready for filming, Peck and Niven were involved in other movies, so their roles were given to Rock Hudson and Patrick McGoohan. The director was John Sturges (THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE GREAT ESCAPE). The impressive score was composed by Michel Legrand (THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR). The screenplay was written by Douglas Heyes, who may be better known as the director of nine THE TWILIGHT ZONE episodes including two classics, \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" and \\"The Invaders\\".<br />The first half of the movie involving the submarine's voyage to Ice Station Zebra at the North Pole, with its intriguing plot and its impressive Oscar-nominated special effects, is enjoyable to watch. However, the second half, when the submarine reaches the North Pole, is somewhat of a disappointment because of the fake-looking North Pole stage and disappointing ending (which reminded me of the ending to RAISE THE TITANIC).<br />I have ICE STATION ZEBRA on Blu-ray and dvd. The dvd's video quality is very good. If you're a big fan of the movie, I recommend the Blu-ray which provides increased video detail for added enjoyment.<br />One obvious mistake in the movie involves the jets over Ice Station Zebra---the Soviet jets are MiG-21 Fishbeds from the front, but when they're shown from the rear, they're US F-4 Phantoms. Ironically, the MiG-21s and F-4 Phantoms fought against each other over North Vietnam.<br />Overall, I highly recommend ICE STATION ZEBRA, but be prepared for the lukewarm ending.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I am tired of the of having a Facebook app and a You Tube app that doesn't work. I have had my kindle for about a year and since then the can't get a good Facebook app or You Tube app. Well this Christmas I think I will buy a new Nexus 7 give this to my 6 year daughter.
B00000GAIW|1.0|If you are in a rock band, and your signature instrument is the flute, then you have a problem.  The flute is not a rock instrument.  No amount of foot stomping, hand clapping, or shouting, can salvage this stinker.<br /><br />Plus, the lead singer for this band is a very unsavory character.  I've listened to some of his interviews.  He's just like you would expect based on his music, a real jerk.<br /><br />A lot of youngsters these days might not listen to FM radio, and have therefore not been exposed to this junk.  So I feel obligated to warn youngsters not to be fooled by the high ratings for this album.  This is really bad music.  The fans of this band are very vocal and rabid.  But most music aficionados would agree that this is really bad music.  It's definitely not a classic album in the world of rock music.  For classics, see The Beatles, Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd, and The Doors.  If you are looking for something harder, maybe try The Who or Led Zeppelin.  For 70's classic rock try David Bowie, ELO, Devo, Rush, AC/DC, Bob Segar, Ted Nugent, Styx, Scorpions, or Supertramp.  Stay away from Jethro Tull.  You've been warned.<br /><br />To get a general idea of the music on this album (and on most Jethro Tull albums), I'd suggest that you imagine you are in a Robin Hood play and there is a guitar band with a loud flute player running around in the woods.  Also, imagine that the singer for the band is shouting and pretending that he is crazy like a fox.  This might sound interesting.  But it's not.  Save your dough.<br /><br />Jethro Tull had only one good song (Bungle in the jungle), and it's not on this album.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|4.0|Helloween have kept themselves fresh and interessant over the years. Straight Out Of Hell is a very good album, a little more happy than the 7 sinners, but equally good. If you liked Gambling with the Devil and 7 sinners you will also like this one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great product. Did not expect much from it but its been a surprise so far. Hope more apps will come for chromcast. Youtube works really well.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A lot more involved than the average puzzle app. The best way to solve it is to close the game for a while when you get stuck. When I go back later, I find something I didn't notice before.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|This show always makes me laugh- even the second time around!I like the fact you don't have to watch them in order too!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|It grabbed and held my attention, and was a perfect book for a Kindle because there were references (often character names) to gods and goddesses of other places and times, and I could look them up and see what they background was. Well written and fun.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For 35 bucks this little device is more than worth it... And the way google is slowly rolling out supporting apps, it's actually increasing in its value.
0399159347|5.0|This book was hard to put down, had some surprises. Good characters and plot. Passed it on to a  good friend when I finished it and she loved it, too.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A fabulous, heartfelt story that was a page turner for me. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I have!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great fun...music and humor...this is one of the few movies we have watched over and over, to enjoy the songs and the very personable cast.
0345529057|5.0|It was an excellent box set of the first four books by g.r.r.m. excellent read with good service. Thanks alot
B008BU70HW|5.0|I love the show but the book is giving a lot of back story to the characters which I simply adore! Includes beautiful photography as well. Highly recommend this item.
B005LAIH54|5.0|I love the re-enactment of history, sci-fi and the special effects.<br />I also have Cot Titans, both cool movies to own.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Kept your interest.  Not as exciting as Cussler but theTracker is a typical American hero.  A man's man .....easy read
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Love that Facebook finally has a real app, hate that every time I open the app, it prompts me to update Facebook and directs me to Google Play, which of course Amazon in all its wisdom, will not allow me to use because.. well, they know what I want and need more than I do. Come on Amazon, I spent money to get my 8.9 fire HD ad free, spent another $80 to buy Prime, and bought the full warranty, plus the hundreds I spend on movies, music and books.. allow me to update my apps please!
072325804X|5.0|Even if you don't have any little ones to read to, cozy up to this lovely volume all by yourself as you're in for a treat. Beautifully produced with Potter's wonderful illustrations, you're never too old to read this book. It's heirloom quality to pass on to all future generations of wee ones and their parents who will love to re-read this book every so often. Absolutely charming.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|Great sounding live album from one of the best of all time Electronic Dance Music veterans. Great start to finish.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It kept me reading all day! I can't wait to start the next one. It's a real page turner. I saw the movie first
B000V6BE6C|5.0|A great heavy metal album with a classic sounding 80's power ballad 'Dear God'. Dear 'Dear God' sounds like it came out if the 80's its such a great song. The rest of the album is great 'Afterlife' is amazing and is a classic AX7 sounding joint. Not a joint on this album
B0031RG846|5.0|I ended up buying two of these, one for my daughter and one for a centerpiece we used at our wedding. My daughter really loves playing with the unicorn and always ask her where it is. So, we of course, keep it in special spot so she can always find it.
B000000OQF|5.0|Its Appetite for Destruction one of the best rock albums ever made. Not a bad joint on this album. My favorite joint is 'Rocket Queen' such a great and unique rock joint. This is a timeless sounding album.
1250037751|4.0|The author creates an interesting and plausible world. Some of the characters are flat, villain one-dimensional, but the book took me to cyberspace and computer concepts that kept me interested. The book is more about the plot and story elements, but shallow on character development. In spite of the shortcomings, I was still able to enjoy the information the book lays out.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I also use it on my computer and cell phone always with amazing results. Excellent tool. Highly recommended. It is also very fast to use.
B004DM1ZQY|1.0|Got it free, wasn't worth the price.  Maybe the paid version is better, but there's so many other really free versions of backgammon its not worth the effort.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|maybe I just don't know how it works. Can't find any place to plug it in the t.v.. need help.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|In one version this program went from good to horrid.  I got it to get around YouTube's blocking of some videos on phones, and the old version was barely sufficient for that.  You had to deal with half the screen taken over by banner ads, and the video would reset everytime the ad changed.  Downloading the video and playing off-line was a work-around.  Then the new version broke all that.  Uninstalled from phone.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|The title pretty much says it all. I only bought this movie out of curiosity and I can't say that<br /> I enjoyed it that much. Getting tired of all this mtv type blow em ups. Know what I mean?
0062082841|5.0|This is a stunning look into what is usually kept private, secret and forbidden. This is an infinitely fascinating journey - better then any single movie ever could be. It's the kind of book you can read 20 times and find something new. What a joy!
B005CMSDKA|5.0|I loved this movie and highly recommend it to everyone with an eye on adventure. There were twists and turns in this movie that was completely unexpected but totally enjoyable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Happy candy crush is now.available..on Kindle. Simple fun entertainment that you can't stop playing. Wish I could have more than 5 lives at a time!
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Loved this movie for many reasons, one was how it transformed me back to my childhood with all the friends I had growing up.<br />We never had the kind of adventure that the movie shows but we had our own simple and simpler times together. The movie was<br />great too in it's own way and I recommend it to all.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game!  Simple uet challenging. You can enjoy without paying so the in app purchasing doesn't limit the game.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I liked this movie a lot. The story was believable as well as the special effects which were done so well as not to be obvious.<br />Recommend this to all.
B003G4W49C|5.0|What a great story! I'm glad that the story would remind me that the main character was just a child. I felt for Ender and his entire family...his biological ones and the people he grew to care about. I could not put it down. Excellent writing. Keep me on the edge of my seat.
B004WESFZW|3.0|Fair movie. Can't remember much about it. May watch it again sometime in the future but it's not on my list of favorites.
B005XUC398|3.0|This movie has a ton of big name stars.  I had never heard of it, but decided to try it.  It was intriguing, though a bit different than I expected.  However, the ending was very abrupt, random, and seemed to leave some things hanging.  Through-out the movie, I was interested, and kept wondering how it would all work out.  But when it ended, I felt like I was cheated out on a real ending, and felt like I had just wasted the last hour and a half.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|Another movies that's so easy and enjoyable to watch. Has all the elements I look for in a movie. The cast is excellent in every<br />respect. Sometimes to a surprising effect. Like the motorcycle gang's position in the movie.  I highly recommend this to all.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This is a great movie!  I love the parallels to The Original Series, it had a lot of humor like TOS, and it helped me to accept the alternate timeline the last movie put this new Star Trek &#34;re-boot&#34; cast onto.  Highly recommend!  Classic Trek!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A great game if you have patience to wait as the take pauses you often....money cannot buy you love but it can buy you lives and booster candy.
B000062YB1|5.0|This is the best slayer album of all time. The originators of thrash put together a classic in the form of seasons in the abyss. Tracks like 'spirit in black' make you wonder why anyone else would ever even try to walk on Slayers footsteps.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This is only good for Utube and I guess Net(ripoff)flix. I cant watch TV through my computer without a DELAY. I hope they inprove this device so i can go wireless watching TV with no CABLE $.
B005QYKE2Y|1.0|Probably one of the worst movies ever made. I was paid to see this movie (so I had to sit through it), that being said, I still feel ripped off. I guess I actually feel more violated. It's that bad.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I generally like the game, but the player life mechanic is a drag. The difficulty of some of the &quot;stages&quot; also feel meant to strongly encourage the player to &quot;pay-to-win&quot;. As a life-long gamer, I have always been against P2W and despise it when something is made to be bypassed by forking over real money.<br /><br />3/5
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Thrill ride with plenty of scares, this is not for children. I normally repel and a have no good words for horror movies that put children in them as subjects of evil or being obsessed by evil spirits. This was well done all around spooky and got me jumping. The way the camera excluded the subject but made the viewer the accomplice in seeing these dead or demon children, disturbed and caught the viewer off guard. the directing was super and acting was top notch between the family. other actors seemed too rigid or unbelievable (Police, deputy). I liked it. now I must try to get some sleep...another good reason to watch.
0141197307|5.0|I am so happy I was able to procure this. If you're a fan of Kusama-san like I, you have to grab this. It's something I'll cherish forever.
0399242600|5.0|Funny, easy to read (and for very young children to memorize :) and just a cute story.  I love this book!
1400079276|5.0|Hands down, this is my favorite Murakami. No, it's dance, dance, dance. No, wait it's 1Q84, wait, no it's definitely Kafka on the Shore.<br /><br />Ahh They're all just so GREAT<br /><br />If you haven't read Murakami before, I recommend you start with dance dance dance, or After Dark. Where there's not 2 alternating story lines.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it.  Took forever to get  it on the kindle but I am glad it finally happened.  A must have so that one can challenge their friends from facebook.
0345802934|5.0|The book is great. Breaking down the extensive book into a digestible 3 volume set makes the reading lighter and actually, more enjoyable.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I saw this on YouTube before it was removed. It became available on streaming services like Netflix, but I loved it so much I wanted to be able to watch it anytime in Blu-ray. Great little movie and really looks good on a large TV at 1080p.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|A typical Malcolm Gladwell book. He uses anecdotes to frame the point of a chapter and then shows the research behind his thesis. Some very surprising findings, though not so surprising after you think about them. A great conversation-starter with people.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Don't skip this one!!!  Couldn't put it down.  And the red wedding is the most crazily awesome scene out there!!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Good, sexy and hot story. I love the development of the characters. This book was supposed to be a trilogy, well at least it was when I purchased it along with the first two Crossfire stories. Well, it's not and I'm disappointed that the relationship was not wrapped up in \\"Entwined with You.\\" I don't plan on reading the next Crossfire romance because now it's as if the story is something you're ready to end but it just won't. The Crossfire novels are beginning to become similar to a movie that has too many chapters such as \\"Halloween\\" or \\"Friday the 13th.\\" There comes a time to just let it go because now it's becoming cheapened.
B00FKAA3MA|4.0|Great album....not better than the Marshall Mathers Lp 1... but still a great album!<br />My favorite top 5 tracks on this album:<br />1.Headlights<br />2.Rhyme or Reason<br />3.Love Game<br />4.So Far...<br />5.So Much Better<br /><br />Looking forward to any new music from Eminem!
B005J4TLO8|2.0|Not a very good movie; I like the actors in it but it is not that funny. I wouldn't buy it again it I had watched it first. But the price was good for a blue ray and it shipped on time and was as described and in good packaging.
B004KKX814|5.0|it beat most of my beyblade.its got 2 mode changes.the fs rocks.the stickers come off to easy.over all its a good buy
B004EBZX6W|3.0|Standard utility item.  Should have been built-in.  Display(s) could have been clearer, but they are sufficient for most needs.  Okay.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|It doesnt let you post in the comments section after you watch a video and you want to comment something!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|As you get into the larger sized grids, this gets to be very challenging.  Simple enough to learn and even get good at it, but aound the 9 x 9 grid, you'll get stumped quite often.  All games seem to have solutions, but you've got to re-start with a clear mind to discover them.
3899554914|5.0|Amazing book with many kinds of moto. Love book and need to buy with who love moto. Rate 5 stars *****
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|Very low 'fun' or play value.  Repetition is annoying.  Low quality animation.  Might be for early teens, but even they know there is better out there.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This is a superb film. Unfairly maligned.  The back story and family origin on Krypton is very rich and unlike anything we've seen before. The culture of Krypton is finally developed. The interaction between Zod and Jor-El is fascinating - they were once allies, now enemies.  It doesn't get any better than Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Clark's parents, and Amy Adams as Lois. Michael Shannon as Zod is brilliant as is Russell Crowe. The backflash story technique is done here masterfully. It's not goofy. It's not overly funny. The villains aren't silly.  It's serious because it's the end of the world. Far and away the best Superman movie yet! Far and away the best Superman actor yet!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It's a CALCULATOR on my Kindle.  Hardly worth writing home about.  Very standard utility item that should have been built in at the factory.
1937053571|5.0|I have loved this series from the very beginning and the conclusion didnt let me down!<br />Jennifer Armentrout, this is my favorite series of yours so far. It even tops your Lux series. Alex had a personality that is unforgettable and Aiden St. Delphi is one of the sexiest, most lovable men I have ever read about in a book. He really melted my heart in this book when he adored Alex, scars and all.<br />The Gods personalities had me laughing so hard at times, but never as hard as when Alex would throw in one of her wise cracks.<br />This whole series was very interesting and had my imagination going wild.<br />This series is a must read for anyone that loves para-normal action and romance! 5 stars isnt enough.<br />1. Half-Blood<br />2. Pure<br />3. Deity<br />4. Apollyon<br />5. Sentinel<br /><br />Go buy them all, you wont be sorry!

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Very interesting book.  I am so glad Jaycee is able to reintegrate into life and go on to lead a happy life.  The book tells that story of what happened to her during the time she was missing. What an awful thing to happen to a young girl.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I really didn't like it, I had just come off the high of \\"The Avengers\\" and let me make it clear, this one isn't as good. That said it is significantly better than Iron Man 2 and that's because the story is deeper and direct. There's a lot less focus on explosions and fancy effects (although there is plenty of that) and more on dialogue and character development.<br /><br />One thing I like about this movie is that you get to learn more about Tony Stark, as much as I loved his arrogance in IM1, 2 at the end of Avengers he was humbled and that continues in this one. On the one hand I love the suits and the fancy technology but it's Robert Downey's sarcasm and wit that make him so great for this franchise.<br /><br />Yes there is a big plot twist but it by no means ruins the movie and while I was not a fan of the ending, you can see where things are going towards Avengers 2.<br /><br />It may not be for you, my only advice is to make sure you watch it again. I was angry the first time I did and thought the movie was a joke, each additional time I've watched it I take something more from it and enjoy it a little more.
0345803485|1.0|Oh my, my inner goddess wants to throw up after reading this book. The whole book must have somehow skipped the editing process. The heroine is unbelievable as a college journalism student who doesn't know how to use a computer, the rich 26 year old billionaire race car driver pilot sadistic weirdo is just as unbelievable. The author has pretty much limited the vocabulary of the main character to \\"Oh crap\\" and \\"oh bad word\\" and she seems to spend the whole book muttering and murmuring under her breath. Both characters do. I can't go on, this book was just too awful, really awful. Worst written book I have ever read.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was a good read. I was not familiar with the series, and found it through some companion books Amazon had written as novellas. After I read ALONE by Brett Battles, I was intrigued  by the idea of  WAYWARD PINES, and sought out the first of the series. I found this an enjoyable read, and I will be hunting down the rest of the series.

B0050PYNN0|2.0|Despite the presence of two of my favorite actors (Natalie Portman and Zoey Deschanel), this movie is not worth watching for most discerning adult movie buffs. Based on the liberal and gratuitous use of scripted-in obscenities (no nudity, however), it's not suitable for nine-and-under viewers.<br /><br />The CGI special effects are up to the usual standards (\\"meh\\") of contemporary B-movies. While Portman and Deschanel help to relieve the dreary awfulness somewhat, it's obvious from their unenthusiastic performances that they're on-screen because they both needed the money. At times Zoey D even seems to have difficulty keeping a straight face while delivering her lines. Having seen her perform on stage, I recognized her \\"I can't believe I'm saying this\\" smirk in several scenes. The film's editor obviously didn't catch it in post production!<br /><br />If you're desperate enough for entertainment of any kind and buy or rent this fecal flick, the weak (as in \\"nearly absent\\") plot line, overly stereotypical characters, and trite substitution of contemporary American English trash-talk for what should be at least \\"medieval-sounding\\" English won't bother you much. This would be a great selection for \\"Kegger Night\\" in the mens' dormitory, but be sure you're REALLY hammered before subjecting yourself to this loser.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|I'm one of the late customers to get a 3D television. So when I purchased a new Television I picked this up right away. This is the first 3D Disney Movie that I've seen and I loved it so much I got all the available ones so far. This was to test to see if I liked it and it was beautiful. The 3D is crisp, and it's just like watching a new movie. You'll see things you never noticed, and you'll be amazed at how beautiful the movie is. It's worth the repurchase in my opinion. Hopefully 3D isn't dying out like all the signs are pointing to. I'm sold on it now. I think it will pick up again. I just think it came out at  a wrong time when everyone just bought a HD television.<br /><br />There is very little they have changed in the movie itself. They took out some flaws, so if your one of those that hate when they take out things(even if it's for the better) you'll be quick to forgive it. It isn't anything as drastic as the ET scene where they removed the guns and replaced them with radios.<br /><br />Once again, you won't be disappointed with this 3D version. I'm even going to repurchase some of the newer ones that I got that wasn't in 3D, since I didn't have the TV at the time. Anyway, just get it already!

B008JFUNJQ|4.0|In the future Earth is nearly destroyed by an alien race of bug like creatures, but we were saved by a great hero that wasn't Casper Van Dien but Gandhi (Ben Kinsley). Children play video games to see who will become the next war leader. The overly robotic Ender Wiggen (Asa Butterfield) is on the fast track to become that leader, trained by Han Solo (Harrison Ford).<br /><br />The film is magnificent in its graphics. The characters are fairly dry as in too many science fiction films which are theme driven. Written in 1985 the film looks at the \\"First Strike\\" debate. Should you attack your enemy first if you believe you are about to be attacked? This was debated in the 1980's and during the 1930's. It became policy in Iraq and is still debated today, the reason why Hollywood chose to make this film now. The film also touches on population control and structural society for the common good.<br /><br />The multiple adult themes have been dummy downed for the young target audience who are surely more enthralled by the computer games than any under lying meaning. If \\"Ender's Game\\" reminds you of other modern films it is because they copied from it, or the book upon it was based. In that regard this feature is similar to \\"John Carter.\\" a film that was not as popular as those it inspired.<br /><br />Worth while viewing for the kids. Adults might find themselves at times bored during the formulaic plot.

B008JFUS28|4.0|As part of their ever-expanding and ambitious film series, Marvel Studios brings us \\"Thor: The Dark World\\", the second film in Phase Two of Marvel's Cinematic Universe and the third overall to feature the God of Thunder. With a new director at the helm, and showcasing the typical humor and action that fans of the studio have come to expect, \\"Thor: The Dark World\\" proves it's a worthy and enjoyable addition to the Marvel universe.<br /><br />The story finds our hero fighting to restore order in the aftermath of \\"Thor\\" and \\"Marvel's The Avengers\\", as chaos and rebellions have erupted throughout the Nine Realms. As battles are fought and uprisings are quenched, an ancient race known as the Dark Elves awakens to seek vengeance on Asgard and destroy the universe. Faced with an unknown enemy and a weapon that seemingly can't be destroyed, Thor desperately seeks out the help of the traitor Loki in hopes to restore order to the cosmos.<br /><br />In his third outing as the title character, it's clear that Chris Hemsworth is more than comfortable in playing the mighty hero, delivering witty one-liners and bone-crunching punches with ease. His acting chops have increased since he first picked up the hammer, which is a good thing because this sequel gives him a lot more to work with, both emotionally and physically. His relationships with Loki (played brilliantly, once again, by Tom Hiddleston) and Jane Foster (the lovely Natalie Portman) are explored quite a bit here, which is a good thing considering the great chemistry between a cast chalk-full of returning actors. Along with a great cast, another element the film has going for it is director Alan Taylor, of HBO's \\"Game of Thrones\\" fame, who accomplishes the difficult task of balancing the fantasy elements of the film with a good character-driven story. There's no doubt his work on GoT helped punch up the battle scenes in the film, especially the large-scale ones.<br /><br />There's a lot of fun to be had in this sequel, more so, in my opinion, than the origin story that proceeds it. Although the first half is a bit slow to introduce the stakes and backstory of the movie, the film really finds itself at the halfway point by exploring the complicated relationship between Thor and Loki. Overall the sequel contains a lot of fun moments, high-stakes action sequences, a terrific cast, and strong direction, making the film a thoroughly enjoyable one.re so, in my opinion, than the origin story that proceeds it.

B00GD9F59S|5.0|Now that is the way to end a series!  True to the story and characters, yet the reader is happy too!  I absolutely loved this story and these characters. I can't help but think the last two pages left the door wide open for even more to be told about their future.  I have never been disappointed when reading this author's work.  Count me in for the next series!
B00EKR61FM|4.0|Love the movies. The book format for the discs is nice, but you cant get the discs out without getting fingerprints on the edges. Also the disc got scratched the first time I removed it. Lastly, if your not careful when picking up the box set off the shelf, the &#34;book&#34; can slide out the bottom, so be careful.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Thought provoking and well written.<br /><br />While informative (for readers who are not scholars of early Christian history), it's not always clear what sources or standards the authors uses to establish historicity.<br /><br />Lessons on the relations between occupying empires and religious factions are surprisingly relevant to politics of the present.

B00FWB6ZBA|5.0|I recently bought the Genesis Revisited: Live at the Hammersmith Box set after seeing the concert live in Albany, NY.  For classic Genesis fans, this is a must purchase!  Steve Hackett and his band members have recreated the songs from the golden years of Genesis and the DVD and CD's are almost like sitting in the audience of the live show that I just saw.  The only complaint...there is a skip in DVD version of the song \\"I Know What I Like\\" just as mentioned by other reviewers.  I almost sent the box set back to Amazon for an exchange, but I see that others have had the problem as well, and that it seems to be a production issue rather than a \\"scratch\\" on the DVD.  Other than this issue, this is one of the best purchases that I have ever made!

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I Loved it.  Of course the actual songs suffer a bit when song by actors who are playing ill-down trodden people who are not in the best of health or spirits, but you must expect that when you combine award winning acting and signing, of course.  I've watched many movie versions of this story, and I'm glad I watched this one, too.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I am in general happy with the game. I am enjoying the content and the different levels. What I do not enjoy is the fact that when I run out of lives they try to make buy them to continue. The wait time for new lives for free is much too long. I do not appreciate the company trying to make me buy anything so I can play the game, when it says free it should not be trying to make you spend money to play.

B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I'm not big on mobile/tablet games. I grew up playing computer and console games and still love them, but mobile games always seem to quickly lose my interest for the most part. Granny Smith has been a pleasant change - with such simple controls, fast-paced game play, and a quick learning curve, I've found I actually come back and play this one pretty often. The stunts aren't overly elaborate, but it's really not much different in that respect from [[ASIN:B007KQ8E3M Trial Xtreme]]. Flips are flips, no matter how many you do in a row. Being able to swing/zipline from a cane is a fun extra element of the game, however. Holding up your cane during a flip also seems to make you rotate faster. And there's something to be said for watching a roller skating grandma smash through walls, windows, roofs, haystacks, and livestock.<br /><br />My favorite part of this game, however, is my girls' reactions while watching me play it. The game has some great and funny sound effects, especially when Granny takes a spill, and my kids go into giggle fits whenever I face plant or fall of a zip line. Scruffy the dog is probably their favorite character to watch.<br /><br />As a VERY casual gamer, I have to say I've been impressed overall with this game. It's easy to learn, it's fun to play, and you can put it down after just a couple of minutes or after an hour and feel satisfied either way. Highly recommended if you like runner/chase style games, or if you have kids that just enjoy watching some funny and silly-sounding slapstick falls and crashes.

B00C74SHRK|4.0|This book has some really enjoyable contemplations of life and relationships on top of a thrilling plot. Like:<br />- &#34;&#34;I love this painting because it speaks to all mankind&#34;. Thats not the reason anyone loves a piece of art. It's a secret whisper from an alleyway. Psst. you. Hey, kid. Yes you.&#34;<br />- &#34;There's a doubleness. You see the mark, you see the paint for the paint, and also the living bird.&#34;<br />- Stay away from the ones you love too much. Those are the ones who will kill you. What you want to live and be happy in the world is a woman who has her own life and lets you have yours.<br /><br />One interesting aspect of the book is that there is hardly any sex. Which would be really easy to put in - criminal world, Las Vegas, Amsterdam, relationships with two main female characters, lots of drugs. But this maybe reflects actually cool arrogance of the author - yes its easy, yes its what would sell. But I can make good literature without the sex.

B00EVW0VTI|3.0|White House Down is a movie that depict a Capital Policeman (Tatum) who is on a tour of the White House with his young daughter who is forced to save his child and protect the president (Foxx) from a heavily armed group of paramilitary invaders.<br /><br />This movie has plenty of action and will keep you entertained all the way through. The problem is that we have seen this before (ala Die Hard or Olympus has Fallen) and there is nothing new added here or any big surprises. In fact, it is a very predictable if not unrealistic story that strays into being a bit too long, time wise. In fact, this movie is very similar in a lot of ways to the Olympus movie except maybe with a bigger budget.<br /><br />The effects and scenery are good and Tatum does a decent job in the role although I personally miss John Mccain from Die hard. The problem is not the acting per say but the script with its terrible one liners that make me wanna smack my forehead. The movie brings almost every type of bad guy into the fold for good measure as well, which just makes the storyline a bit more silly and improbable.<br /><br />A classic it is not, but it is watchable purely for the action and with its flaws makes it an average one to watch at best.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is fantastic! I've been using it for weeks now to learn Spanish. The controls are intuitive and I find it easy to learn a second language. I use this app on my laptop, my Kindle Fire, and my Android phone, and the app is great for that. It always keeps up on my progress, and I've had no issues at all. It's a great way to learn another language, and the best part is that it's 100% free. However, the one tiny issue that I have with this app is that you need to have speakers. This is fine when you're working on it at home, but in public places; not so much. It plays a word/phrase in whatever language you're learning, and you are supposed to type that word/phrase out. It's a bit awkward when one is in a quiet place (think waiting room at the doctor's office). You have to turn the volume way down and hold it up to your ear, or just wear headphones. This isn't a major issue, and all in all, I think that Duolingo is a fantastic app for people of all ages to learn an important life skill of being bilingual.

B00DYVUBYM|5.0|If ever a subject was perfect for Sofia Coppola's touch, this was it.  A huge fan of hers, I ignored the load of crappy reviews and ordered the film anyway - glad I did.  The subjects in The Bling Ring are similar to those in previous films: whether Marie Antoinette, the characters in Virgin Suicides or the Bling-ers, these are teenagers in the process of making a transition to adulthood.  Instead of using a narrative style, Coppola goes for what most of us experienced in our own teenage years - blinding speed, mental snapshot images of people/events, often vacuous preoccupations and ever-changing interests.<br /><br />For the Bling Ring, this group bought all of the hype and obsession surrounding celebrities and their trappings and tried to up their own personal stock by stealing pieces of property from the people they idealized.  That this actually happened isn't what surprising; that it hasn't happened MORE is surprising.<br /><br />The actors did a fantastic job of portraying rudderless, self-absorbed, completely detached group of young people.  Not ONE was concerned with the morality of what they did; and only one had limited concerns about getting caught.  Watching the film, I was struck what blank canvasses each appeared to be - defined only by what they wore.<br /><br />I LOVED this film!!! It is an absolutely fascinating story and Sofia Coppola's deft touch brought this story to life in such a way that the viewer feels like a fly on the walls of the events and in the minds of the group.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|It is highly enjoyable - doesn't get old.  The comedy is very skillfully done.  The actors seem to be well balanced people in life.

B003INBNXO|5.0|I'd never heard of this movie before it was suggested to me by some enthusiastic coworkers; we'd been discussing great martial arts films, and after I'd mentioned a few classics like The Five Deadly Venoms, Flying Guillotine, and of course Enter the Dragon, I was surprised when told IP Man should rank alongside the best of them. I just finished watching it, and, I must admit, what I was told is true. Cinematically, this is a beautifully rendered film; from scenery to wardrobe it just looks great. The story is compelling, moving, and inspirational; and, most important, the martial arts is kick-ass! It's a must-see for anyone who loves well-made movies, particularly for anyone who loves well-made martial arts films.

The characters are complex and the essential question is how much of Ender is Graff willing to sacrifice in order to save Earth.
