B002E9VT00|5.0|In 1946, barely a year after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, August 6 & 9, 1945, John Hersey wrote an important little booklet about the effects of the bomb upon the lives of six Hiroshima residents who survived the blast.  Updated several times over the next 40 years, Hersey follows the lives of these six.  \\"Hiroshima\\" is at once a story of the moments just before and just after the tragic event, the effect of the blast upon the city and its residents, the courage, heroism and sacrifices of the survivors as they struggled to understand what had happened and their heroic rescue of other survivors.  In this Hersey succeeds admirably.  In the process, \\"Hiroshima\\" provides a snapshot of Japanese lifestyle and manners.  Much of the story written in the phraseology of the Japanese themselves, Hersey describes a lifetime of recurring medical and psychological problems.  Played against the backdrop of initial resentment of Americans for dropping the bomb, Hersey also describes how the Japanese themselves came to understand the responsibility of their own military leaders in starting the war that resulted in the destruction of their city, as well as the role of religion, Japanese as well as Christianity in dealing with the humanitarian issues.  \\"Hiroshima\\" is a cautionary tale of war and of man's inhumanity to man, without attempting to overly blame any single individual or group.  Short, to the point, interesting, not easy to read (due to its subject), and not easy to dismiss, this small volume should be required reading for anyone interested in understanding the impact our decisions make on others, and how it effects them for the remainder of their lives.  For a specifically detailed and more thorough study of the effects of the atom bomb itself, one would need to find a longer and more modern book.  This books value is in its humanity, which is, after all, what the lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki teach us.  Highly recommended. (Note: This reviewer readthe 1989 Vintage Press version. Other reviews are also found under other printings.)

B0016K40KO|3.0|I could have bought a single DVD with the movie only for half the price but thought I'd go for the Collector's Edition.  In my opinion, the second DVD is not worth the extra money. Mildly interesting background material.  The reason you're buying the DVD is to watch the movie on disc 1.
B000W4KT6E|1.0|I agree with another reviewer who stated for a film that is supposed to fight stereotypes it sure took shots at a variety of groups. To me it had an in your face anti-white agenda unlike the Broadway production. Having viewed thousands of films in a lifetime, this was without fail the worst piece of biased trash I have ever seen. Some friends rented this and on a visit to their home was subject to it. Terrible.
B002DW92T8|5.0|Just red this book and even if there are not very many new findings the author has a unique way of decribing and adding to the \\"old\\" discoveries. Definitely worth the time to read and the cost!
1594488843|2.0|This is a good book and a fun read, but contains nothing new.  The key motivation models that influence the author's thinking are classic management studies from the 70s.  These are taught in any Organizational Behavior or Intro to Management class at any decent business school.
0061122416|5.0|My best friend gave me this book to read when I was going through a rough patch.  This book helped me too look at the decisions I have made.  I have a different outlook on life and I owe it all to the words of wisdom contained in this book. I have to read it again so that I can highlight key phrases.  This book touched me and I highly recommend it.  Thank you Paulo Coelho!!!!! I plan to read 11 minutes next!!!
B000Z27HLS|5.0|My daughter's review:    This is the adaptation to watch again and again. Felicity Jones is charming, JJ Field is completely yummy, the pace of the movie is good, it's well acted - just an all around fun movie. Three cheers for Austen and Masterpiece Theater! And FOUR cheers for JJ Field! :)
0307463745|5.0|Honestly, this is one of the best books on business I've ever read.  Every page is pure gold, and I found myself constantly saying, \\"so true!\\".  It is purely practical, no nonsense, straight to the point.  A must read.
B002VKE0XA|4.0|I think the \\"sophisticated\\" and \\"savvy\\" movie-goer of today often turns out to think he is the 2nd coming of Ebert. I rented this last night, and I turned off the lights, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Played on my worst fear of all. Think every movie should be a freakin \\"Titanic\\" or \\"Avatar\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\"? Maybe you need to sit down and re-examine your expectations of what you enjoy in movies. I bet half of the entitled, boring, 1-star reviewers here were the same kids years ago that went to see \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\" or \\"Independence Day\\" and thought those were sublime film-making at it's best. Lighten up, for God's sake.

B002RAREAK|4.0|Since I got Usher's \\"Raymond vs. Raymond\\" album; it has not left my cd player and that is definitely a good thing. I know a lot of Usher's songs had leaked out prior to the release of this album but I didn't spoil myself with the leaks. I feel like Usher is pretty consistent with each other so this one is just as good if not better than \\"Here I Stand\\".<br /><br />The intro to \\"Monstar\\" can kinda wear you down before it jumps into the track. When it does; it's loud, thumping, and full of bass. \\"Hey Daddy\\"; the official first single gets you with those opening lines which leads into that irresistible pre-chorus. \\"There Goes My Baby\\" feels real good and is one of the best songs on the album. \\"Lil' Freak\\" is irresistible and very naughty. \\"She Don't Know\\" is cool and \\"OMG\\" is fun and catchy.<br /><br />\\"Okay\\" and my favorite \\"Making Love(Into The Night)\\" are slow jams. Some of the songs before that prior to the aforementioned aren't the strongest songs(\\"So Many Girls\\", \\"Guilty\\") as they are simply album filler. I will say Usher does a good job of not creating much filler.<br /><br />Overall \\"Raymond vs. Raymond\\" is pretty solid album and like most albums; the first half of the album easily triumphs the second half. I will say that I do admire that Usher is very real with his music and a lot of the material he delivers is personal to him and not just some random song given to him by a songwriter.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This show has been on TV on and off for years. It is super funny and we decided to buy it because we both like it a lot. Great movie.

B002GZQYMK|1.0|I'm a confirmed Music Junkie who spends way too much time in record stores and can appreciate very nearly any kind of music at all--rock, pop, blues, country, R&B, whatever.  And I always think it's a little ridiculous when someone claims to HATE a certain album or singer.  I mean, it's just music--it's not like they're HURTING anybody, right?    And then I listened to this.  It is quite possibly the worst album I have ever heard in my entire life.  If you hired a team of scientists to somehow combine all the worst traits in contemporary music, they would have come up with The Resistance.    There is something vacant and sterile and soulless about this album.  The style is something of a cross between the rhythms of a dance album and the weird-for-the-sake-of-weirdness soundscapes of various Alt-Rock critic's darlings, but without the joy and sexuality of the former or the creativity of the latter.  The lyrics are just a string of vague abstractions, both melodramatic and emotionless, like all the worst scenes from a Michael Bay movie.  The lead singer can't decide whether he wants to sound like Thom Yorke or Freddy Mercury, so he does a horrendous impersonation of both on EVERY SONG, with his voice electronically manipulated to sound even worse than it should.  And furthermore, is Muse even a band?  As in, do they play instruments at all?  If I showed them a guitar, would they know what it was?  Because all I can hear is a mess of synthesizers.      I want my money back.  I want that hour of my life back.  I feel hurt and angry and betrayed, and I want to hunt down the [EDITED] at Spin Magazine who praised this album to the rafters.  It's too late for me; please, people, don't let this happen to you.
B00008977N|5.0|Simply put, My wife and I both love this performance. We watched it on TV years ago and finally just had to buy it on DVD. The Secret World Tour live audio cd is nice, but to watch the show is a real pleasure, very entertaining. The band seemed to be having a great time onstage.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Really liked this movie, suspense, and lots of special effects make this a great movie.
0788876988|5.0|I loved the movie all over again, I will have my 8 yr old nephew and 5 yr old, and all the other abot 9 yrs that want to watch it.    It is lovely, on my recent vacation/retreat I drew pinochio onto a full page (from a little 2-3 inch from Disneyworld)., and now I have my own \\"self made poster to enjoy\\".    The product came very shortly after I had ordered it.  Thanks,  G. Novack
B002EWD0I6|4.0|Once again BBC dishes out a classy period soap opera. The production values are high, and the acting is good. Every episode is a mini-melodrama where some character gets into trouble or has to make a decision, with the smaller problems resolved and the larger ones carried on. Viewers' heartstrings are constantly and carefully tugged.     Episode after episode, Miss Lane and her former boyfriend Sir Timothy dance around whether to carry their relationship to a different level or end it entirely. Actually, they decide to end it repeatedly, they just don't carry through--even though they've been having this debate since Sir Timothy got married over four years ago. The feckless Lark Rise housewife Arliss has been pregnant for the entire Season 1 so far (I'm partway through the last episode). And there are other issues that seem dragged out for no particular reason.    Some episodes don't hold together. For example, the one where a needlepointed tapestry over 50 years old is found sitting on a grave in the churchyard wrapped in a thin layer of newspaper. It's supposedly been there, outdoors, for 50 years, but, hello? it hasn't gotten moldy. It gives several characters the same spooky dream, except for the poor man who found it, who fantasizes about making what is for him a fortune from selling it--but then, he inexplicably gives it up. The specter never actually appears. The narration promises at the beginning that this incident will \\"shed light on Miss Lane's past\\"--but considering the tapestry proves to have nothing to do with her, it doesn't. A fizzle, in other words.    Episodes also show the unevenness of different script writers, with Sir Timothy's wife's character ranging from naive and silly (at times hysterical), to intentionally catty, to wronged but resolute--then back to something else. The actors' accents range from Irish to English North country, and are sometimes present and sometimes not.    Lark Rise to Candleford really is a fine period soap opera, just. . . a lot of the time it's nothing more. I recommend taking it in rather small doses, as what is charming once every two or three evenings becomes somewhat annoying every evening.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|I have been a fan of this band for a long time. When I first started listening I thought the album was not as heavy and they were moving into more progressive than a metal sound. But after listening and especially seeing them live...I was amazed! Mastodon played the entire album Crack the Skye when I saw them live. It was extremely EPIC. I have never seen a band play their entire album before, and I love it. To keep it short...I highly recommend this album. It is one of my favorites of all time. This album is changing rock n roll and metal for the best...BUY IT AND SEE THEM LIVE!
B0000029DD|5.0|Probably around 1999, my sister introduced me to this album.  Perhaps not others' taste, but Jeff's achingly sensual vocals in 'Hallelujah' had me at the first verse.  Over ten years later, now close to 40, I continue to be brought to near-tears by the emotion and tragedy of Jeff's short life.  If I could have chosen to see one of my contemporaries in concert, it would have been Jeff.  May he rest in peace.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|The series is a really good! I can't wait for season 2 to come out on dvd!
0143036556|4.0|Looking back in history we are able to see mistakes made, and compare those mistakes with what we are doing now.  Mr. Diamond looks at societies that disappeared and makes us stop and look at our own mistakes and wonder if we are on the same voyage.  Easter Island was once a thriving place, but they destroyed their trees, and native plants--and as Mr. Diamond asked when he appeared in Seattle at a National Geographic show--how did the person feel as he chopped down the last tree on Easter Island?
0805028846|5.0|So far, this well illustrated and step by step book, is one of my bes shopping I´ve ever made! My school class really enjoyed making some of the samples. I really recomend it!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|If you enjoyed Planet Earth, you will love Life.  Please be *very careful* to buy the BBC version that this review is written for.  The other (US) version is unwatchable due to the US narrator chosen specifically for the US series.
0823015017|4.0|A beautiful book, on time! I´ve enjoyed reading an starting to create my jewels. Thank you very much!
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Oprah as narrator for this series must be the single most colossal blunder in the history of television.  As virtually everyone else here has said, it is an excellent documentary, but get the British version narrated by Sir David instead.
1594488843|5.0|First off, reading the book takes less time and is much more enjoyable than reading Wally Block's review.  This is a well written, well thought out, well researched book.  At times, it is a little wordy and moves a little slow, but it is well worth the read, especially if you're in a position of motivating others.
B0011KQSZ4|1.0|I did not laugh once during this so-called comedy, and I like a lot of British humor and black comedy. It's not that I didn't get it. I just thought it was tasteless and boring. The production looked cheap.
006621131X|4.0|\\"Just Kids\\" is just another Jersey-factory-girl-runs-to-New York-and-hooks-up-with-bisexual-art-pornographer-on-her-way-to-rock 'n roll-stardom story.<br /><br />It details Patti Smith's evolution from tentative neophyte to rock-and-roll poetess, woven through with her unique relationship to Robert Mapplethorpe, a triumphant artist whose own untimely ending, alas, makes for engaging literature.<br /><br />The place is lower Manhattan. The time-period is the mid-1960s and 1970s when Mapplethorpe and Smith are, age-wise, a \\"beat behind\\" the reigning princes and princesses of rock's golden age.<br /><br />As such, she is influenced artistically by the Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, and Janice Joplin for whom she pens poetic cycles while absorbing political pointers from Jean-Luc Goddard's \\"One-Plus-One.\\"<br /><br />The life-as-artist anecdotes have a familiar ring: hunger, rejection, perseverance, and a healthy amount of name dropping.<br /><br />Smith has affairs with Jim Carroll, Sam Sheppard and a guy from Blue Oyster Cult. Allen Ginsberg mistakes her for a pretty boy in the Automat, and Gregory Corso imparts stern advice to the budding scribe inside her.<br /><br />They are revealing tales that highlight Smith's achievement as survivor of an era peopled with fascinating characters demolished by addictions and carelessness.<br /><br />\\"Just Kids\\" is the portrait of a New York City not completely subsumed into the grid of overpriced realty, before the Internet, where artistic ambition had a geographic component and required settling into some dump on the mighty Isle.<br /><br />Here is \\"art\\" before its subsequent elevation to bourgeois respectability. To an artist of today's saturated market, the idea that you could install yourself at the Chelsea Hotel and initiate apprenticeships with living legends seems, with the benefit of hindsight, a no-brainer.<br /><br />One can only assume that, in those days, choosing art meant the painful burden of rejection from loved ones and dangerous uncertainty on the path ahead.<br /><br />So, as time capsule, \\"Just Kids\\" is just great.<br /><br />But autobiographies should tell us something we don't know about somebody. They can be intriguing when it comes to artists, because they are usually reinvented characters very mindful of their own brands, of what they show and don't show the world.<br /><br />And who does Patti Smith tell us who she is/was?<br /><br />For starters, because it's really how she got it going, Patti Smith is/was American as apple pie; thrifty, industrious, entrepreneurial, and self-involved, her Rimbaud-inspired disdain and punk rock posture notwithstanding.<br /><br />Here Smith describes her efforts in the opening stanzas of the couple's bohemian idyll:<br /><br />\\"I scoured secondhand stores for books to sell. I had a good eye, scouting rare children's books and signed first editions for a few dollars and reselling them for much more. The turnover on a pristine copy of 'Love and Mr. Lewisham' inscribed by H.G. Wells covered rent and subway fares for a week.\\"<br /><br />And she is a fashionista of the first rank.<br /><br />Long before Patti Smith was confident enough to confront an imposing poetry world, she parsed a personal vocabulary in clothing ensembles that, 30 years on, she remembers down to the last accessory.<br /><br />In this passage she describes a successful attempt at sartorially seducing Television guitar-star Tom Verlaine to work with her band:<br /><br />\\"I dressed in a manner that I thought a boy from Delaware would understand: black ballet flaps, pink shantung capris, my kelly green silk raincoat, and a violet parasol, and entered Cinemabilia where he worked part time.\\"<br /><br />And she is materialistic. Not flat-screen TV materialistic, for sure, but tightly tied to and moved by objects tactile and tangible.<br /><br />Before joining Mapplethorpe for a photography shoot she, \\"laid a cloth on the floor, placing the fragile white dress Robert had given me, my white ballet shoes, Indian ankle bells, silk ribbons, and the family Bible, and tied it all in a bundle.\\"<br /><br />During the shoot she is stricken with anxiety that is eased by Mapplethorpe's knowing voice and a change into dungarees, boots, an old black sweatshirt.<br /><br />Smith interprets this evolution as an expression of certain ideas she and the photographer have discussed prior. Ideas about the artist seeking contact with the gods, but returning to the world for the purpose of making things.<br /><br />Her conclusion to the section does not surprise: \\"I left Mephistopheles, the angels, and the remnants of our hand-made world, saying, 'I choose Earth.'\\"<br /><br />As for Mapplethorpe, especially if you're a foot soldier in the art world, he seems a rather common phenomenon: ambitious and single-minded in his craving for fame. Patti's lazy percolation into what she would ultimately become makes for an infinitely more interesting yarn.<br /><br />One gets the feeling he might agree. In one of the most charming parts of the book he tells her through a cloud of cigarette smoke, \\"Patti, you got famous before me.\\"<br /><br />She dubs Mapplethorpe her \\"knight,\\" but this reader cared thanks to the love she invested in him.<br /><br />Mapplethorpe, of course, was an artist and all the writing about art in the world cannot replace the actual experience of it. Perhaps he is shortchanged by the autobiographical form; try as his muse does to honor him.<br /><br />Although we rarely accuse anybody of being too old to rock 'n roll anymore, writing remains a mature person's game. So it was Smith's good fortune to be a writer first, a musician later, and a writer now, because she brings lit-passion and a high level of skill to \\"Just Kids.\\"<br /><br />This is especially true towards the end of the book. In earlier stanzas she is more a chronicler of the famous and idiosyncratic characters surrounding. When the poetess describes the artistic vision, purpose, and goals upon which she ultimately settles, the narrative assumes the force of that direction:<br /><br />\\"We imagined ourselves as the Sons of Liberty with a mission to preserve, protect, and project the revolutionary spirit of rock and roll. We feared that the music which had given us sustenance was in danger of spiritual starvation. We feared it was losing its sense of purpose, we feared it falling into fattened hands, we feared it floundering in a mire of spectacle, finance, and vapid technical complexity. We would call forth in our minds the image of Paul Revere, riding through the American night, petitioning the people to wake up, to take up arms. We too would take up arms, the arms of our generation, the electric guitar and the microphone.\\"<br /><br />Pretty grandiose stuff.<br /><br />But she is, in \\"Just Kids,\\" nothing if not a dramatist scripting the play of her own life, decorating it with universal symbols, inserting Patti Smith into art history's larger arc.<br /><br />There are persons and outlets, many in the cultural current Smith helped generate, who find such self-positioning both cloying and pretentious.<br /><br />Not highwayscribery.<br /><br />Worms squirm in the mud and we are all welcome to join them. Walking with the deities is the tougher task and should be worthy of our admiration.the shoot she is stricken with anxiety that is eased by Mapplethorpe's knowing voice and a change into dungarees, boots, an old black sweatshirt.

075640407X|5.0|The name of the wind by Patrick Rothfuss is a masterfully delivered fantasy novel.     A believable world and realistic characters mixed with intriguing plot devices makes The Name of the Wind a book you cannot put down.     My only criticisms are as of April 2010 he has not written a sequel, and his book robbed me of several hours of sleep.    This book is a must have for any avid reader.
B002VECLVO|5.0|This was an extraordinary film, subtle, tender and breathtaking. Firth gave an Oscar winning performance but had little chance against Seahunt's son, whose \\"acting\\" was simply to play himself with dirty hair and dirty shirt. Disappointing that the \\"Academy\\" cannot distinguish between superb acting and a good costume. Do not miss this little jewel of a film.
0061906220|3.0|I had borrowed a copy of this book from a friend and loved it.  So I had to get my own.  I was disappointed that the \\"song\\" that goes along with the book had to be downloaded.

0307454541|4.0|A plant called Rubinette is seldom cultivated in Sweden.  It is unpretentious.  It likes a dry climate, and has to be watered from below, and is part of the mystery.  Mikael Blomkvist, journalist, is found guilty of the aggravated libel of a financier.  Confusing the picture, Blomkvist is part owner of the magazine and publisher, in addition to being a writer.  He will pay the damages himself and the magazine will cover the court costs.  Professionally he has received a smack on the nose.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander works for Milton Security.  She is a gifted investigator.  Dragan Armansky heads Milton Security.  One subject of investigation is Mikael Blomkvist.  She comes to believe that in the Wennerstrom affair Blomkvist has been set up.<br /><br />Mikael is summoned by a former captain of industry, (one of the Swedish industrial oligarchs), Henrik Vanger, to undertake a free-lance assignment.  In addition to money there is another inducement to accept the assignment.  He is given a cover story that he is assisting the aged Henrik in the writing of his autobiography.  He is to find the truth surrounding an unsolved missing person's case.<br /><br />Blomkvist is a financial journalist.  He believes that other financial journalists have not been severe enough with the financiers.  Blomkkvist's quest is of necessity interrupted, briefly, when he serves  a sentence of incarceration of two months for the criminal libel conviction.  He finds the actual conditions of imprisonment resemble that of a youth hostel.<br /><br />Stories pertaining to the book's characters run in parallel lines.  There is much to be concerned about in modern day Sweden.  For instance, silence of young oppositional girls works to their detriment in this modern social welfare state.  This is Scandinavian Noir-- awfully dark, expressionistic.  Brace yourselves.  This is genre fiction that blows away the category of genre fiction as being nicely familiar and soothing.  There is nothing humdrum about this book.

Many are admitted by a nudge from the judge from one too many DUIs, or some other external motivation; and in no time, they're hopscotching around the facility and asking everybody they meet, and who'll listen: \\"what's your drug of choice\\"?  Meanwhile, those with real addiction disorders, e.g. chronic heroin addicts or bridge-dwelling alcoholics(alcohol-only) represent the real face of addiction: misery, dispair, hopelessness, and extreme, unrelenting dysphoria. For junkies this all occurs AFTER acute withdrawal and 14-22+ days into treatment; And Cravings? these are cellular cravings where every cell in the body and each organ system \\"cry out\\" for homeostasis via a central nervous system; itself a bundled mess of electrical overload, misfired synapes and anxiety so bad that twenty valium 10mg. make you feel drunk and dope-sick at the same time...but No sleep. Then there's the obligatory, know-little addiction counselors, who never having been heroin addicts themselves, always state in some group or lecture: \\"Heroin withdrawal is like a really bad flu; it's really not that bad\\"--\\"you can't die from it\\". To which I say: 1. Did you ever see someone rob a drug store because they had a really bad case of the FLU? --And 2. The number one cause of drug-related suicides (attempts and successes) by non-dual diagnosed patients, occurs in junkies during acute withdrawals AND, post-acute withdrawals! --And 3. A heroin addict 50+ yrs. old in acute withdrawal is four times more likely to die from Cardiac arrest, Carotid aneurisms, Ischemic cerebral vascular stroke or Cerebral perfusion - than a well-fed, quietly resting cocaine addict after a ten-day/ten night crack-run. So Nikki my boy, stick with your Crue and make \\"music\\" and leave the Smack addiction autobiography to the real junkies - -at least any who are alive.
B000006OS2|1.0|Seriously poor quality.  I \\"wish\\" I had read the reviews on this product before I ordered it!!  It was as if someone had videoed the movie from a TV screen.  The picture color was poor, the images were \\"grainy\\", and the film was \\"scratchy\\".  I loved the movie when it came out, but this was a very poor quality product.  Amazon should take this off their market.  It reflects poorly on them.....
B0002O7XW2|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and the extra scenes were great.  A classic. Definitely worth seeing.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|My mom recommended this to me and said I'd love it since I love pretty much any BBC drama. She was right!! My husband and I watched the whole season and didn't want to stop! We're in our late 20's and we laughed and cried together while watching it. I was surprised my husband liked it so much. The stories and characters are so full of love. It has wonderful lessons and morals, it's a perfect family show. We had his parents watch it and they loved it just as much as we do! We've only seen the first season but I can't wait to watch the second one. I hope there will be many more seasons to come. The acting is wonderful and the sets are fabulous! LOVE IT!!!
B0036XN2L2|2.0|If you believe that the Scorpions musical peak was from their Lovedrive through Crazy World CD's you'll be glad to know that this CD is mainly done in the style of that era of the band. Unfortunately, most of the songs on offer here sound like uninspired leftovers from that era or new tracks that were banged out in 15 minutes. Frankly, only two tracks \\"Raised On Rock\\" and \\"Sly\\" come close to deserving to occupy the same space on a CDR or Hard Drive as the bands best work. The lyrics are rife with cliches and often sound like the first attempts at lyric writing by a twelve year old (\\"Rock Zone\\", No Limit\\", \\"Slave Me\\", \\"Raised On Rock\\", \\"Spirit of Rock\\" etc.) I know that even at their best the Scorps lyrics would never make the Neil Pearts of the world feel threatened, but with the exception of \\"Sly\\" they just don't sound like the musings of a well seasoned and intelligent group of middle aged men. The guitar work, even though the down tuning is less prevalent, is also not particularly inspired either with simple riffs abounding. Honestly, I thought these guys were improving on their previous couple releases after a real lull in their career with \\"Pure Instinct\\" and \\"Eye II Eye\\". \\"Humanity Hour One\\" was a four star CD for me, even with the down tuning, so it's a downright shame that the band chose to mail it in and not really push themselves hard to go out with a bang, but instead, we'll all have to settle for this whimper......
B0035KGWR2|1.0|I was really looking forward to the new CD of Amy Macdonald, after the superb \\"This is the life\\".  \\"This is the life\\" was a fantastic folk/rock CD and the voice of Amy was awesome.    After the first seconds of listening of \\"A curious thing\\", I was wondering where was the Amy I knew from his first CD.  Her great folk/rock style has turned to pop/rock (more pop than rock by the way), and above all her voice is now lost in this pop/rock soup. The result is that the emotion I am feeling each time I am listening to her first CD is not present anymore on this CD.    I am feeling so disapointed.     Sure the album is nevertheless enjoyable if you do not compare with \\"This is the life\\". But frankly Amy has lost her soul to the profit of a producer that seems more interested in selling Amy's records to as many people as possible than continuing with her original folk/rock spark (sure this new style is even more sellable than the old one).    I really hope that we will find back the original Amy in her next album.    (Sorry for my english, this is not my mother tongue)
0307271862|2.0|Ya Ru, one of Mankell's characters, expresses his (and I'm afraid my) weariness on page 345, \\"How long ago was it?\\" he said aloud into the room. \\"How long ago was it when this story that is now coming to a close first started?\\"  Answer:  345 tedious pages ago!    The characters in this book live in the self-absorbed present.  For them a kindness from a day ago, a cause from a generation ago or an offensive from a century ago is still a potent catalyst for torment today.  Driven by retribution or prepossession, the characters make decisions and take actions seemingly without anticipation of their potential, and likely dire, consequences beyond the immediate self-satisfaction they achieve.      As the plot trudges along, it's further bogged down by far too many political details of past and current Chinese history which, though important and sometimes disturbing, here often register more like propaganda than narrative development.      Reading this book to the end provides the reader with Mankell's resolution (or termination) of the primary tangents of his story.  The experience, however, was like a long, cold Nordic night absent a lover or a good story -- no excitement, no adrenaline.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Some people around us have nothing, virtually existing in a world where food is a luxury and opportunity is seldom available. Michael Oher is one of those people. Michael Oher, homeless, parentless (for all intents and purposes....his mother is a drug user) and misunderstood, just needs a break. The opportunity comes when Michael encounters Leigh Anne Touhy, an aggressive Southern Belle and wife to ex-Athlete and Taco Belle chain owner (85), Touhy. They both see this as an opportunity to help a someone who has never had a bed or been a part of a traditional family (although Leigh Anne's idea of a Thanksgiving dinner is take out). Michael a big guy with a gentle soul, and a lot of heart works hard to achieve his goal, and soon finds himself up for a football schedule having to decide between Mississippi and Tennessee.    While some may be tired of these kind of feel good movies, there is still a place for them in our minds and hearts. I too was reluctant to watch \\"The Blind Side\\", after all I've seen, other football related dramas like \\"Remember the Titans\\" and \\"We are Marshalls\\" and wondered what could this movie offer? Well, I have to admit that I am glad that I did. Although all are based on true stories, about men who beat the odds (whether it was segregation, racism or simply their misfortunes) to become professional athletes, the \\"Blind Side\\" suggests that there are some people in society who do for others with no hope of reward or recognition for the acts themselves. And in this story, although race was an issue, it seemed to focus more on the socio-economic difference between Michael and the Touhy's, versus race. Although some questioned the motives of the Touhy family, to mentor and later adopt a young athlete who had tons of potential, I believe that they did it because they wanted to make a difference. The tutor, the coaches, and even Leigh Anne's children, all worked together to make Michael a success.
B0001WGDXA|4.0|I feel that these interpretations are interesting but not great. The tempo is at times too slow or too intensely infused with emotion which makes the music sound somehow repressed throughout. There are those who like this approach but it's a matter of taste more than anything else. For me, it is not ideal. Yet, these are the first recordings of these symphonies I ever heard and they were good enough to make me fall completely for these works.<br /><br />I prefer Karajan for symphony no. 1, Kleiber for no. 4, and Bruno Walter for no. 2 and 3

B003102JDM|5.0|A Serious Man is an exquisite work of art by Joel and Ethan Coen. Although one could say that the pace of the movie is slow, I think it allowed for some extraordinarily fine character development and the acting was completely outstanding from these actors some of whom are largely unknown. The choreography and the cinematography shine and the script was brilliantly written; there's scarcely a minute flaw in this remarkable movie.<br /><br />When the action begins, we are treated to an elaborate opening which takes place in an eastern European village over a hundred tears ago; although brief this sequence manages to explore life, death, luck and relationships in a very concise way without ever providing concrete answers to the issues discussed by the characters. This sequence also lays the groundwork for the main portion of the movie. We then meet mathematics Professor Lawrence 'Larry' Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) who experiences life as a series of events that either take him by complete surprise or grab him by the throat and never let him take control. Lawrence is a passive man out of touch with himself and his family; but yet his inability to find meaning for major life events is something we all can relate to at least now and then in our lives. Larry is stunned to hear from his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) that she wants a divorce as well as a Jewish ritual to end the marriage; Judith has found romance with Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed) and she wants Larry and his mooching brother Arthur (Richard Kind) out of the house very quickly. At the same time, poor Larry tries to cope with the sudden and understandably upsetting deaths of a lawyer and someone else (I can't say who without giving something away so I won't name names here).<br /><br />Worse yet for poor Larry, he's oblivious to the fact that his son Danny (Aaron Wolff) is experimenting with drugs and ordering record albums all the while charging it to Larry; and it's not any better when the FBI come to Larry's home to inform his brother Arthur that he better not be caught gambling again! In addition, Larry is pestered by a young Korean student (David Kang) who has failed the mid-term exam; the student and eventually even his father try to bride and intimidate Larry into giving him a passing grade. Even Larry's next door neighbor Mr. Brandt (Peter Breitmayer) causes trouble for Larry.<br /><br />Larry tries to find answers and meaning for what happens in his life; his lawyers almost always tell him that he's in a real mess. Larry also goes to Rabbis for help but finds no clear-cut answers because the Rabbis lack concrete and profound answers themselves. Look for great cameos by George Wyner as Rabbi Nachtner and Simon Helberg as Rabbi Scott. Alan Mandell does a good job of playing Rabbi Marshak, too.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a couple of nice extras as well.<br /><br />A Serious Man paints an unforgettable portrait of a man, a type of everyman, who tries desperately to understand why bad things happen to him in his life; Michael Stuhlbarg gives a stunning performance that you really should see. While it may seem as if I've given it all away, I assure you that I haven't and the emotional effect this film will have on you will not be lessened one bit by what I've written here. Don't pass on this excellent film; it will provide you with so many meaningful issues to think and talk about with your friends and loved ones. I highly recommend this motion picture.rother Arthur that he better not be caught gambling again!

B0015XHP3Q|3.0|After the awesome 1982 film First Blood & it's d**n good sequel 1st Blood Part 2 1985. Rambo became an American legend Stallone returned to the role of John Rambo in 1988 in Rambo III. Richard Crenna returns as Colonel Truatman were also introduced to Robert Griggs played by Kurtwood Smith wish he would've gotten a bigger role. Marc de Jonge plays the movies villain Colonel Zaysen. Plot is Colonel Truatman is going to Afghanistan to deliver weapons to the rebel fighters Rambo refuses to go saying \\"His War is over.\\" Truatman is captured by the Soviets so when Robert Griggs an Ambassador tells about it Rambo wants to go in Griggs says \\"The Government will deny your exsistance if your MIA or KIA.\\" Rambo's like \\"I'm used to it.\\" Rambo III is a good sequel & we wouldn't get Rambo IV for another 20 years. The story is straight forward & the action kicked @**. This was my favorite performance by the late Richard Crenna as Sam Truatman he had the strong dialogue & did more action wise.
1427203059|5.0|Jeffrey Archer can spin an amazing tale, but Roger Allam sure can read it!!  I picked up this audio book at my local library for  a car trip, but I found that I needed to bring it into the house by CD 3.  I just couldn't put it down!      Archer's plot is captivating, and Allam's skillful portrayal of each character draws you in to the book. I highly recommend this as one of the best mystery audio books of the year.  It's long, fascinating, and full of good plot twists.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Sandra Bullock plays Margaret, an uptight, ambitious publisher who is going to be deported following her visa's expiring. Trying to save her career, she bullies her assistant, Andrew into agreeing to marry her. To complicate matters, Andrew is suppose to go home for the weekend and celebrate his grandmother's (played by Betty White) 90th  birthday. So imagine the events that unfold as he takes his blackberry totting, rigid boss home and introduces her to his tight knit family. Margaret is not only surprised by his wealth but the closeness of his family, even if it includes a disapproving father who believes his son can be more than a publisher or writer. As Margaret and Andrew navigate pretending to be lovers, guess what they do....they fall in love.     There was an overzealous immigration agent, a wistful ex-girlfriend, a bartender/stripper/storekeeper extraordinaire and several other things that made this movie a hoot. I love romantic comedies, especially those starring the very sexy Ryan Reynolds, extremely funny Sandra Bullock, humorous T. Craig Nelson and loveable Betty White. I highly recommend this movie to those who for over an hour want to laugh out loud. You won't regret it.

0953104907|5.0|good book worth the money. discusses how to do carved tops, finishes and alot of the in depth details that matter when making a guitar. Do not just by one book on the subject get this book in conjunction with other books like the one by koch these two books together would be like a super book for building guitars.
B0015XHP4K|3.0|Back to my Rambo III review. The part where Rambo & Truatman are surrounded I love the part where Rambo says \\"F**k em!\\" That whole finish of the movie rocked btw C4 tipped arrows ftw. So it's a good sequel that comes pretty close to 1st blood Part 2.
0425166805|3.0|First published in the late sixties, \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" by Mr. Erich von Däniken is a science (fiction) story of the universe, our world and of the future. The overwhelming majority of the book is made up of Mr. von Däniken's personal conjuncture, speculation and insistence that our planet was \\"visited\\" millennia ago which in turn has reshaped civilization as we know it. Any book, as this does, that starts out disecting Sodom and Gomorra is really grasping for something which I found lacking in the overall contexts of the passages. I found his writing somewhat compelling in some parts, although somewhat tiring because there isn't any research, studies or even extensive interviews with anyone to even remotely broach the subjects at hand. The book also tends to move around in many different directions without paying much attention to continuity. For example Mr. von Däniken writes about the pyramids and how the structures could not even by made by today's standards then he discusses the universe and our own galaxy in particular. These are all vastly complex subjects which in my opinion should really be fully addressed and a book less than 200 pages long is hardly long enough to get off the ground. The book does provide some pictures (although the quality is lousy) which really did not did impress upon me anything important to the book. Overall the book was well-written and interesting in some parts and even funny. I cannot imagine anyone, though, would take \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" seriously, under any circumstance.

B003EVFHYG|5.0|I'm never prepared to give a soundtrack five stars - but this one won my heart.  The soundtrack for \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" was a surprise from the outset.  It is bold and deep as well as tender and adventurous!  I noticed the music while watching the movie in 3D; and it was epic.<br /><br />Individual songs, such as \\"Forbidden Friendship\\" stand on their own as deeply moving, precious musical pieces that bring the audience closer into the emotion of the film.  John Powell really broke the mold with this score, and I feel that anyone who loves to listen to soundtracks; or writes to music (as I do), should buy the MP3 Album and download it right away.  More is to be said for the use of a variety of instruments.<br /><br />Some composers use a standard 100 piece orchestra.  In addition to the orchestra, there are sleigh bells, war pipes and more.  Listen closely because this piece is sure to give you more than you bargained for.<br /><br />The music of John Powell will have you training your dragon in no time!<br /><br />Happy listening,<br /><br />-C
1423119509|5.0|I had been searching for the complete set of hardback books for my son's 11th birthday.  Walmart and Target only had book 5 in hardback, and everything else in paperback.  Someone suggested that I try Hastings record store.  They had the collection for $89.95!!  My husband was ready to buy it when I suggested that we try Amazon.  I found the set for $47.25, and had it shipped and delivered the next day for $3.99 with the prime shipping.

0385342039|5.0|I picked up this last week at the market & figured it would be an easy read while working (I work from home & tend to have moments with nothing to do - long story) but this was much more fun than I expected.  I have read Sophies other books and they are fun and energetic but I get a little annoyed at most of the 'damsel in distress' story lines that we are fed from the age of 3 (Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty) and I feel that this book bypassed it and led it's readers on a true adventure.  I loved the mix of the modern girl and her great aunt who was in her prime in the roaring twenties.  It made me miss my Grandma but made me call my Grandfather everyday and even promted me to spend a lot longer at my weekly visit and hear his stories of WWII.  I think that without giving away any goodies about the book, that I guanantee you will laugh out loud, fall in love with the girls, want to learn more about the twenties and want to hug the nearest older person and tell them that they DO matter and we won't forget them.  I absolutely loved this book and the valuable lesson it taught me.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs is a Disney Classic! The Blu- Ray is the best way to go to view this film for the quality is unbelievably good. The picture quality is so sharp it is the best print I have ever seen. In this package you get both the blu ray and the DVD copy which was a nice bonus.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|For those of us with home theatres in place and not planning to delve into 3D in the near term, it makes a lot of sense to consider this release.  Personally, I think 3D is on the bleeding edge at present with first generation gear and expensive glasses being sold.  I would wait until the second or third generation appears, image quality reviews have been conducted, and enough content is available to justify making the investment. 3D viewing in the home is experimental, at present.  While it is dissapointing that the special features are missing, we all enjoyed the movie first and foremost and we did not have the features in the theatre!  I like the idea of having a DVD backup for use on computers, auxiliary systems, etc. I will buy the disc when it comes out this month and enjoy it for what it is.

1592402690|5.0|I won't take long, as other 5 stars reviews have already written quite a lot.  This book is one of the BEST if not THE BEST book I have ever read about the Beatles. I couldn't put it down.   This book is the best insight into the intimate creative times of the fabs + George Matin and the author in the studio. This is something I strived for and finaly found it.  Only thing I miss in this book is that Geoff Emerick was not present at all Beatles recording sessions so we don't have the full report. I could just hope that Norman Smith would publish a similar book.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|I am so glad that Disney released this classic film back onto DVD. I missed the chance to purchase the [[ASIN:B0000TG9E2 Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)]] when it was released in 2004, and have debated whether or not to purchase it or wait til Disney re-releases it with more features etc. So when I saw that the new edition was going to be released I jumped on it! I am glad to say that the wait was well worth it and this release is outstanding!    The package states that the film received and all new digital remaster but other reviews have stated that it is the same remaster from the 2004 edition. Needless to say the quality is outstanding. I owned the VHS version of the film from my childhood but with so much wear and tear the film didn't last. The image is so clear it brings new life to the film. I do wish however that Disney would have considered a Blu-Ray release at the same time as the DVD release but the picture quality is so good, it didn't bother me too much.    I can't recommend this film highly enough it has always been one of my favorites, and now it can be part of your family collection for the next generation to experience the world of wonderland.
B0029LHX1W|5.0|\\"Child 44\\" is a tightly woven story taking place in old-school Russia where Big Brother is everywhere and a fabricated incriminating charge is just a step away - a charge no-one could defend against.<br />Because that would mean the State is wrong.<br /><br />The story starts with the terrible disappearance of a boy named Andrei during the famine in the 1930's.  without explanation the story hops 20 years ahead to the terrible death of another young boy named Arkadi. At the same time, an adult Soviet citizen named Anatoli is running away from  the state security forces, the MGB.<br /><br />This is just the lead for the introduction of Leo, an ideologue MGB officer who is ambitious as well as unquestioning of the policies he is enforcing - believing in the State and the greater good.  Leo's faith in the State is so blind that he even goes to the house of his friend Fyodor, the grieving father of the dead Arkadi and a colleague at the MGB to tell / threaten / warn the family to stop yelling \\"murder\\" because Arkadi's death was a tragic accident.<br />So said the State - even if they refuse to show Leo and Fyodor any evidence.<br />Violent crimes do not exist in the worker's paradise since no-one is starving (supposedly) and the State takes care of all one's needs (as little as they may be).<br />So why commit crimes?<br />Heck, even suggesting that there has been a crime, is a crime unto itself.<br /><br />The author is unapologetic and uncompromising, the story is raw and honest but not over-the-top (I read somewhere that the author based part f the story on Russian serial murderer Andrei Chikatilo).  The picture painted of Communist Russia is bleak, vivid, stark and freighting.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book tremendously; it is fast paced, interesting, great characterization (including minor characters) twists galore and a surprise ending.  The plot twists and turns often and leaves the reader guessing and hungry for more, there are acts of heinous violence and political intrigue.<br />This is well written book, even though it's around 450 pages the story moves swiftly and there is not a word out of place.ough it's around 450 pages the story moves swiftly and there is not a word out of place.
B002UJIY7A|4.0|We watched the director's cut so I can't speak to the theatrical version or whether it was different.  But on the directors cut we say Yay! We enjoyed this movie far more than expected by the ho-hum \\"honeymooners\\" trailer.  Timothy Olyphant was excellent and we were cheering for him and his girlfriend by the end.  This movie had subtlety and action and you really will enjoy the second half more than the first.  The first half of the film was a lot of storyline building and character development and some things just don't make sense in hindsight, but it was a really good weekend flick!
B001ASVXSE|5.0|I have been a collector of classical recordings ( no atonals included except Stravinsky)for over 45 years.I went through 78's, 45's and finally CD's. This past summer I purchased a season ticket to a segment of the presentations of a local International Music Festival. In addition to the season ticket presentations, I and my granddaughter(9 years old) attended many of the presentations of the students of the festival (200+ individuals). We had a wide exposure to all types of instrumentations. Myself, an unaccomplished pianist, fell in love for the first time with the violin and the other related strings. My grandaughter still leaned toward her piano but I sense a musical growth. To make a long story short I began a CD collection of violin selections and eventually fell under the spell of Hilary Hahn whom I have almost a complete collection. Early this year I had the opportunity to attend a much too short concert at the Nursing Home my wife resides in, given by the Daponte String Quartet( minus one: the second violinist was home with a brand new baby girl).  SIDEBAR: The violist was a former chemistry \\"A\\" student of mine ( who said musicans can't count? ). After the music there was a question and answer session.  I asked the cellist ( call him Myles ) whom he felt was the greatest violinest of the Twentieth century;( expecting Hilary). Without hesitation, he answered, \\" David Oistrakh \\". Which led me to youtube and later to Amazon where I made the  purchase of a 17 CD collection of Oistakh, and which proved Myles' point. Hilary will be the best in the twentyfirst!
B002MTTZ5I|4.0|Wow, what a ride.  This CD captures the feel of 80's hair bands exactly, and is hilarious!  I agree with other reviews.  Steel Panther captures the feel of 80's hair bands that would only make sense to someone who was a teen during that era.  I graduated high school in 1987, and they certainly \\"get\\" the era.  I can't wait for their next CD!  Rock on Steel Panther!

B001OQCV6A|3.0|Kelly Reilly absolutely SHINES as Dr. Watson's love interest. Who is she?! And where can we see more of her?  Ms. Reilly would have been a better Irena Adler than Rachel McAdams. Ms. McAdams did not have the gravitas for the role, while Kelly Reilly could have pulled off the sophistication and subtlety of Conan Doyle's most famous female character.  Jude Law was engaging and believable as Watson.  Robert Downey Jr. was okay as Holmes, though not the best acting performance in the film,,,,too silly and dopey IMHO.  The worst thing about the film and why I gave it only three stars was the ridiculous plot and jumpy all-over-the-place direction.

My messages are markedly more memorable.<br /><br />I'd recommend Made to Stick to anyone who needs to deliver messages to diverse groups of individuals or if you find yourself drifting away when you listen to your co-workers PowerPoint presentations. Made to Stick is the best remedy I've found for death by PowerPoint.
1594488878|5.0|One of the most enjoyable books I have ever read.  Funny and heartwarming with Hornby's distinctive British voice.  I didn't want it to end.
B001IU8RWY|5.0|One of the best ACDC cd's ever. I listen to it every day. I'd recommend it to any one who loves ACDC
0691143692|4.0|What is most interesting about this book is that it is not organized in a regular linear way as most history books are; that is on dates, starting from early years progressing to later years. It is organized instead, on subject matter or events. I found myself able to skip chapters and return later when up for politics instead of customs or living style. It is a book beautifully balanced for enjoyable reading and learning historical detail, ending in a conclusion that encourages further reading about Byzantium. Most history buffs will find it great reading, filling a gap sorely needed about a great empire that western civilization has largely ignored. I highly recommend this book.
0756405890|4.0|First of all, let me state for the record that I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  A friend of mine turned me on to it a few months ago.  The only problem I see with the series so far, like a few other authors as of late, the incredibly long delay between books.  A person shouldn't have to wait years to read a series.  (I enjoy writing as much as any other author, but one of my major pet peeves is waiting a lifetime for a series of books to be complete.)    As for all the haters out there... man, you guys need to learn to laugh at yourselves.  To spend what, hours on the internet thinking that you alone hold the key to whether anyone should read a book or not.  Come on guys, we all have opinions, each and everyone of us... the only time a problem exists is when \\"YOU\\" think your opinion is the only one that counts.  (These are the same people who wait in line at a traffic light and honk as soon as it turns green, even though they are tenth in line... get a life.)    Simply put, I liked it.  Not life changing, then again, I have yet to find a work of 'FICTION' that is life changing.  We're trying to find a little entertainment, that's all.    I hope Mr. Rothfuss has a long a prolific writing career, and I wish him all the best.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Although I have yet to actually buy the DVD set, I have to comment about the show itself. Sheldon is a priceless comic creation, and one I've never seen before. Many other reviewers have commented on the fact that it will supposedly be appreciated most by those already educated in science/math disciplines, but I feel that this is not really true. My own background is strongest in language and literature and, although I'm sure I miss some of the more scientific references, the show is equally adept at skewering all intelligent and/or well-educated people with a somewhat dimwitted view of the wider, more complex socially-adept world that, enthralled with their own narrower obsessions, they've never really paid enough attention to in mastering those complexities, and consequently think they're the only \\"complex\\" mentalities out there.     In short, it's about \\"academic\\" people, those that live in restricted, technical worlds (doctors fall into this category too, quite often) and is brilliant at affectionately portraying both the advantages and embarrassments of being such a person...    The first sitcom I've really cottoned to in the new millennium, even if I came to it late...
1416550550|5.0|Another great book from Kate Morton. I didn't want to put it down but I didn't want it to end either!
B002N3GD2Q|5.0|Like almost everyone else who has written a review for this release I am a huge Doors fan from way back, so I guess I am biased.  However, I feel this live box set is a very important and powerful document.  For the band AND for popular culture.  Two things make this set an important release; first, the audio-verite approach...  Every second of all 4 concerts is included.  While at first glance this might seem like a lot of filler (and redundancy), the approach is actually very effective.  A certain weird power kicks in as you listen to these entire concerts in \\"real time.\\"   Second, the overall high quality of this run of shows.  Of course, the sound is excellent, one of the most exciting live mixes I have heard, thanks to Bruce Botnick, the band's recording engineer from day 1. Musically,  Jim sounds surprisingly good, strong and in-key.  The band's playing runs the gamut from raw and ragged to blazingly brilliant, sometimes in the course of the same tune.  I guess that's part of their charm.   When I put on the first disc, I must admit, I thought \\"more of the same\\" and \\"man, this sounds kind of rough\\", but now I can't stop listening to it!!  Probably the best of the Bright Midnight releases.
0670021652|3.0|I love Elizabeth Gilbert's writing. What she lacks as a journalist (which isn't much), she more than makes up for with sharp insights, the wit of a stand-up comic and writing that often borders on poetic. I like her too. \\"Eat Pray Love\\" made me root for her. I wanted her to find a happy ending. A happy anything. And here comes this book about the next phase in her relationship with the man she falls is love with in Indonesia in the end of \\"Eat Pray Love.\\"    But that story ends before the first chapter. Literally. I'm not giving anything away. The title does: \\"Committed.\\" And if that's not enough, \\"A skeptic makes peace with marriage.\\" I knew that in buying the book, of course. Still I figured: Great, she's happy. I looked forward to hearing about it. And I looked forward to Gilbert's reporting, history and usual accompanying insights and quips on the institution of marriage. There's too little of her story, however. And the reporting--as she herself admits--is incomplete. This isn't The Book Of Marriage by Elizabeth Gilbert. The wit is there always. Yet the sum total is a collection of essays pertaining to marriage which Gilbert collected in her travels. One or two of them might have made fascinating magazine articles. I'm not here to play editor. Overall, there isn't much cohesiveness. The writing in places is great. As a book, though, there are simply too many long, dry patches to rate this book four stars, much as I'd like to for the brilliant bits here and there alone.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I was never a big fan of Bill Murray, but when his comedic abilities are used perfectly to portray the ultimate cynical stranger, a great actor is revealed.<br /><br />Murray and Johansson are two strangers faced with life's emptiness in Japan who bond as two spirits, two friends and maybe more! The question remains; if you are a stranger everywhere, does it make a difference what country you are in???<br /><br />This is a very smart and deep movie that will leave you wondering, do you know yourself well enough? Do things still upset you like before? Highly recommended!
B000TEUSJK|4.0|I read about this movie and the producer several year ago and I was expecting a completely different experience than the one that I got. I thought that since it was a Penthouse film that it would have Penthouse type of material but it also came with a story line that I couldn't believe I was drawn into.  I just had to watch it from beginning to end not just to see the over elaborate sex scene but to find out how the story ended.  For lack of a better phrase, it was something.  Don't be angry if you never get to see this movie in this lifetime! If you do get to see don't tell too many people that you've seen it. Although, I will say, I'm glad I got this movie from here at the price that I paid. Thanks a bunch for watching my pocketbook AMAZON!
B002RAREAK|5.0|A definite buy. The best R&B album in a LONG time (since Trey Songz Ready).  This is a really classic album that touches everything from the slow jams to party hits. Being a music aficionado, I understand why each song was put on the album and what direction he's taking his music.  Everyone has different taste in music and where they think Usher's music should sound like, so don't take my word for it, buy it and check it out yourself, you won't be disappointed.

B0002234LS|4.0|Johnny Depp is a writer who's going through emotional crisis and is confronted by a stranger, who accuses him of stealing his story and demands him to change the ending. Some of the details of the plot are compromised for the sake of surprise and shock, but the outstanding performance of Depp makes up for any compromises. Watch this movie and try to overlook the simple suspense details and think of the more important questions: If you could go back in time, would you act differently? If you have the power, would you change the ending of certain stories in your life? How torturous is the relationship between you and your conscience, and after all, how outstanding is it to have a talk with your conscience every now and then?
B001GM28HO|5.0|Gaga is truely amazing. She shows her talent with several music styles on this cd. Great music for listening to in the car or while cleaning the house. Her songs are upbeat and makes you just want to sing along and, well, just dance. :)

B002VPE1B6|5.0|My five star review of this movie and product, just to offset the one star reviews of all the haters:<br /><br />If you fell in love with this film in its original theatrical release, then this is the best product for you. If you are intrigued about an extended version of this phenomenal film then wait for that version or simply buy both.<br /><br />I know I am going to double or even triple dip on this movie.<br /><br />This initial release is essentially a super bit version of the first theatrical release. No other version of this film on blu-ray will ever be as lossless or have as much high-fidelity to the original source medium.<br /><br />The Studio isn't forcing you to buy this version and they are certainly NOT trying to pull a fast one on you either. Fox and Cameron have both released statements of an extended version that has been created and to be released on home video at a later date (most likely early next year). The extended version of the film will be making a world wide debut this summer with a run in the theaters of at least six months. Now think about this: If a movie is going to be shown in the theaters, then why would the studio supersede this event by releasing it on home video prior to it?<br /><br />On top of the new extended version there will be a 3D home video release based on the NEW 3D technology, a technology that NONE of your homes are outfitted with. This NEW technology at its cheapest quality will still cost the average consumer $3000 or more. This is NOT the old school 3D tech that incorporates red/pink and blue/green cardboard glasses. Just to give you a heads up, even the NEW glasses will cost you an average of $150 a piece. Even most brand new blu-ray players sold today wont be able to support this NEW 3D tech, and add the price of the NEW 3D HD televisions you will end up paying $4500 or more on a system to handle this NEW tech in all that it can offer.<br /><br />Just google RealD or Tru3D to find out more about this NEW stereoscopic technology.<br /><br />Some might claim that they already own blu-ray that are in 3D, but they are mistaken if they think this is the same tech that AVATAR will be using. Right now there isn't a single home video for sale that utilizes this NEW tech.<br /><br />Sure, I want the (to date) unseen extended version, but it wont be anywhere near the visual and audio quality of this version. Just speculation here: I would think that the extended version would have to be placed on a dual-layer double sided blu-ray with only one half the film on either side. If this is not done then there surely would be a loss of information as the movie would have to be highly compressed.<br /><br />If you \\"avoid\\" this release, I can guarantee you will be missing out on the BEST transfer this film will EVER have on blu-ray.already own blu-ray that are in 3D, but they are mistaken if they think this is the same tech that AVATAR will be using.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|I first heard Florence + the Machine on YouTube, the home of the music video ever since Mtv became the home of inane \\"reality\\" shows. I think I must have played the videos I could find by this band ten or more times in a row. Ever since the divine Kate Bush stopped releasing albums on a bi-yearly pace (she now is on the decade-release schedule, along with Peter Gabriel), I've been missing this kind of sound: a strong voice that can span octaves who understands dynamics and has a decent production that mixes simple piano lines with driving beats and layers of overdubs that don't muddy the whole thing but give it a sense of unrestrained joy. That's about as good a description as I can give you of \\"Dog Days Are Over,\\" which starts off slow with some kind of repetitive plucked string instrument (mandolin?) and Florence Welch's soft vocal, then adds handclaps, piano chords, and harp, and builds with a great bass beat, as the vocal builds in both intensity and adds an overdubbed background vocal choir. Halfway through it calms again, to catch its breath, then hits again at full steam. It's a great song, even if I have no idea what the lyrics are actually about.<br /><br />And that first song isn't even as good as the next song, \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up),\\" which combines the better parts of Bush, Sarah McLachlan, and Loreena McKennitt in a lush song picture. This is the kind of experimental rock music I yearn for, especially that break right around the one minute mark where it breaks into a huge chorus with multiple voices (or, more likely, simply overdubs by Florence). The verses have this interplay between the lead vocal and a responsive background chorus, similar to some of the songs on the back side of Hounds of Love. Yes, I can't stop comparing these songs to Kate Bush, and there's no better recommendation I can make than that. Other songs in this vein include \\"Drumming,\\" \\"Cosmic Love,\\" \\"You've Got the Love,\\" and \\"Binding\\" (the drum part in this one, in particular, reminds me of \\"Running Up That Hill\\").<br /><br />Listening to the album from the beginning, it would be easy to think that Florence was simply going to be Kate Bush-like, but there's enough variance on this album to showcase her own style. \\"I'm Not Calling You a Liar\\" is more bluesy, albeit by the way of some blues that invoives a harp and a piano instead of a steel guitar. Even more bluesy is \\"Girl with One Eye,\\" which uses just guitar and drums along with Florence's vocals. The nice thing about this song, however, is that it does the soft, loud, soft thing that the first couple of songs did. \\"Hurricane Drunk\\" and \\"Howl\\" have traces of hip-hop, or at least modern R&B, in its delivery, although the vocal delivery and instrumentation are strictly this nouveau folk experience that I assume is Florence's assimilation of the last three decades of female singer-songwriters. \\"Kiss with a Fist\\" sounds like an outake from KT Tunstall's debut album, replacing all that folk sound that I've been going on about above with a guitar + drums sound that's more White Stripes, including a fuzzy feedback-laden guitar solo. This song seems to have been somewhat controversial, as the lyrics seem to describe a domestic violence situation and comes close to celebrating it, rather than providing the politically correct statement.<br /><br />Overall, this is the strongest album I have heard in the last ten years. Every song has power, either in Florence's strong vocals or through the unique combination of multi-vocal choirs and acoustic rhythms (handclaps and punctuated piano chords, mostly), unlikely pairings of traditional and modern sounds, and a focus on using variance as a part of the music. That is, songs will start soft and become loud, or switch midstream between slow and fast. It's so unusual in these days of mastering everything to 11 that songs which even have soft sections like this come across as an innovation (whereas it was a prominent feature of pretty much ever progressiverock album in the 70s).

B0026P3G12|4.0|I really like Susan Boyle's voice and thought her first CD was very good.  But, to me, all the songs sounded very similar in that they were fairly soft and mellow in tone without the depth that most good professional singer have.  She didn't have that   Wow\\" factor that she had on the talent show that made her a star.  I was a little disappointed in the songs, but I would recommend it as good background listening music.  Amazon.com was excellent, as usual, in processing and sending my order.

B0035G1K7S|5.0|I would have to sat this is one of the best documentaries of a rock and roll group out there. You learn not only what drives Jack White's muse but learn that the \\"White Stripes\\" really care about their fans. A true artist gives back to their fans the best they have to offer. The White Stripes do just that. We see how close Jack and Meg White are as a musical team. They play country, folk, pop, blues and rock and roll. The range of Jack's talent was more than I realized. He plays acoustic and electric guitar, mandolin, piano and organ. Meg plays drums and piano and even sings. They play free concerts in each of the towns in Canada on their tour. In pool halls, bowling alleys,on boats and town centers. They prove by their example that rock and roll can heal and uplift people's everyday lives. This is a five star disc if I ever saw one.
0743455967|5.0|I discovered that writing memoirs isn't much different than other types of writing; novels, texts, etc.  I picked up many techniques I was not aware of and a few I had unconsciously been doing.  For those I was already doing it gave me confidence.  Where I was not sure, I learned what I was doing was a good or bad strategy.  An example technique was to \\"put down\\" the first draft for a period of time in order to revisit it with \\"new eyes.\\"  I have about five different subject memoirs presently \\"in storage,\\" and wasn't sure this was a good thing to do.  Turns out it is.  Steven King's book gave me increased confidence.<br /><br />I also enjoyed King's personal memoirs as it relates to the trade; how he got published; the army of personnel involved.  Much more interesting and yes, fun to learn.
B002UNMWAG|1.0|This movie sucks. It was nothing like the first which was and is a classic. The director either didn't know how to recreate his masterpiece or didn't care. Don't waste your money. There are a few attempts to capture the interface between the brothers but the movie just doesn't work.

0812973992|5.0|This may be the best book of the year (for me) so far. Centered  in New York city and the days surrounding the tightrope walk between the World Trade Center towers by Philippe Petit in August, 1974, McCann weaves a moving tale of people whose lives intersect in interesting ways.     There is Corrigan, a monk who provides creature comforts and a place to pee for the local whores, and his brother Ciaran, horrified by his brother's ministrations and circumstances until he sees beyond his initial impressions. There are the 'fallen women' too, Jazzlyn and her mother Tillie, both on the stroll but dreaming of anything better. Miles uptown, Claire Soderberg and her judge husband, Solomon, are still reeling from the death of their son in Vietnam. Claire meets with a group of other mothers who have suffered the same loss, but this is the first time she's hosting the meeting in her Park Avenue penthouse, and she fears rejection by the less rich group. Gloria, the only black member of the mothers group, discovers something new as well, about herself and others.  Judge Soderberg surrounds himself in work and rituals, finding it hard to talk about his loss, even with Claire. And high above them all, the wire walker stuns and uplifts his watchers, and all of the characters find some connection to the idea of the man on the wire.      The writing is gorgeous, the chapters gracefully weave one character's narrative into another's. There is great sadness, but there are moments of humor and kindness, and always, compassion. I loved the characters and the story and setting. I can't summarize the wide-reaching plot, because it's not strictly linear and so beautifully compressed, and better experienced by the immersion of the reader. Well worth anyone's time.
0061914177|3.0|The book is exactly as described but was way too short in my opinion.  While I want to cash in on my passion as stated on the cover, there wasn't much here beyond the initial premise and a few good examples.  Yes I agree it can inspire you to break out and do something exciting (breaking away from your 9-5 job), but it was not enough to justify a full (short) book.  As a series of articles on a website it would be wonderful, and I guess one way to \\"cash in\\" is to publish a best-seller which is a major accomplishment.  I say worth a quick read but borrow from a friend if you can.
B00004BZ0N|4.0|Bought this album in a two cd box set, bundled with \\"Combat rock\\".  My cd probably isn't one of the remastered versions, but the sound quality on it is brilliant in any case.  To me, this album isn't punk at all, but that's not a negative for me. It's quite English in atmosphere and entirely listenable and engaging. It's punk transformed into something more catchy and mellow. \\"London calling\\" is The Clash's best album, just nudging \\"Combat rock\\" for that honour.  It's a mature album where the band have fun with form, even doing some reggae style songs. Would give this album a score in the 87.5 to 90 out of 100 range.        The best song:        London calling - fantastic sound quality...spacious, e.g. the drums. Cool bass with political lyrics. Generally regarded as a classic track. I can see why, but I don't embrace it as much as I embrace great songs by their peers...say, The Sex Pistols' \\"God save the queen\\" or Australian co-inventors of punk The Saints' \\"Know your product\\", which I consider the greatest punk song of all time. \\"Eternally yours\\", the album that that song comes off, is also one of only two punk albums I give 5/5 too...the other being Stiff Little Fingers' \\"Inflammable material\\".        Next best song (on second listen):        Four horsemen - punk transformed into catchy rock. Bassy, piano, drumming is good and I like its tone too. A rollicking track.    The card cheat - catchy pop-rock song. Catchy bass-piano-brass-singing. Pretty trumpet parts in this song too. Sort of a rock opera type song with a big beat...Jim Steinman territory, perhaps (the guy who created albums such as Meat Loaf's \\"Bat out of Hell\\").    Spanish bombs - catchy track; catchy Pixies like lead guitar notes. Dual vocals. Semi or full acoustic guitar...good strumming.        Best of the rest (on second listen):        Rudie can't fail - jive guitar intro. A familiar sounding and catchy brass part. Two vocalists. Has a reggae \\"I fought the law\\" vibe to it. Handclaps and backing vocals.    The guns of Brixton - think they get a reggae singer to sing this track. Reggae vibe to it with an interesting drum tone. Bassy.        The rest:        Brand new cadillac - bassy notes. Sort of B52s meets New York Dolls meets The Cramps...basically rock'n'roll music with Cramps.    Jimmy jazz - starts with whistling. A laid back song, with sort of retarded vocals. Acoustic and electric guitar. Saxophone. Has some gruesome lyrics. A little folk rock in style.    Hateful - is that an accordion being used? Jive guitar? Backing vocals.    The right profile - brassy and brassy track. Jaunty.    Lost in the supermarket - sort of pleasant indie pop. Bassy, nice lead guitar. The other guy sings on this...lyrics from a child's perspective.    Clampdown - interesting intro. Pop-rock with a simple drum beat and guitar riff and chorus. Chorus seems familiar...can't quite place it.    Wrong 'em boyo - brassy, sax, Hammond organ. Ska-ish? Backing vocals.    Death or glory - bassy. Interesting drumming and tone.  A Status Quo like boogie rock riff. Catchy singing with vocal references to the title track.     Koka Kola - deep bass. About advertising (The Saints' \\"Know your product\\" is also about this topic, and it's my favourite punk song of all time). Song sounds a bit punk at times. Backing vocals.    Lover's rock - easy listening pop-rock...sort of Eagles like...expressive lead guitar at times (nice solo). Has a co-singer. Piano. Change in mood in this song too. Wiki notes that \\"lovers rock\\" is a style of reggae. My cd has a pop at 2:21 minutes. First one on this cd, perhaps.    I'm not down - bass like intro has The Beatles' \\"And I love her\\" melody. The other guy sings on this track. Interesting drumming.    Revolution rock - brassy, reggae, easy listening. Deep bass guitar sound. Organ pops up later. Bit of a jam/boogie. Interesting drumming and tone.     Train in vain -catchy vibe...sort of funky. Bass, harmonica, piano or keyboard. The other guy sings.Recommendations for The Clash:        Combat rock. As with \\"London calling\\", this has a nice variety of sound. Not punk either.    The Clash. The US release is slightly stronger than the original UK release. Didn't know that their were two versions...when I got the original version, it bugged me first listen...don't consider either version to be a classic but unless you are a purist, go the US release.    AVOID: \\"Give 'em enough rope\\"...a very \\"meh!\\" album. Die hard fans only.        Recommendations for punk/arty punk albums:        Radio Birdman - Radios appear. Punk enough for me. They tend to get called \\"proto-punk\\" though. Has nice jazzy songs on their debut. Influenced by The Stooges...that band's \\"Fun house\\" album was a jazzy jam on the second side of the vinyl.    The Saints - Eternally yours.  Has punk songs and some pretty songs too...reminiscent of some of the kind of songs you'd hear on the \\"Nuggets\\" box-set (i.e. first volume of that box-set).     Wire - \\"Pink flag\\" and \\"Chairs missing\\" have elements of punk to it, but they are quite arty. I like their third album the best, \\"154\\"...it's not punk at all. Got all three cds as part of a box set. Turned out to be good value for a punt.     Patti Smith - Horses. Don't really consider her to be punk at all, but others do. A poetic album with some disturbing flourishes to it...think \\"Jimmy jazz\\" but more obscure and no less troubling.        Pure punk/proto-punk:        The Stooges - The Stooges. However, \\"Raw power\\" is also cited as a major influence of the first wave of punks.     The Damned - Damned damned damned. First English punk album. Of the pub rock variety.    Stiff Little Fingers - Inflammable material. Gave this album 5/5. Great punk album which does push the envelope too.     The Saints - (I'm) Stranded. THE seminal punk album in my view. You couldn't ask for a greater proto-type for what it means to be a punk band...D.I.Y all the way.    Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers - L.A.M.F. Like RadioBirdman, these guys get called \\"proto-punk\\",  but for me they're punk enough.    Ramones - Ramones. The first official punk album (The Saints were next cab off the rank but they owed no debt to Ramones). Has some sweet pop songs on it too, as well as the punk standards.     New York Dolls - New York Dolls. A proto-punk band but they do sound punk at times...maybe more so live, but I wouldn't know about that. The Cramps sounded a bit like this band. Johnny Thunders old band.
B001AUKUS6|4.0|Ratt was looking to avoid the sophomore slump when in July of 1985 they released `Invasion of Your Privacy' and in many ways they succeeded. Although it would be fair to say that Ratt peaked with `Out of the Cellar', the second LP was a more than competent slice of Hollyrock, like a summer's evening on the Sunset Strip. It was on `Invasion' that Warren De Martini solidified his position as Ratt's main lead guitarist and tasty would be a fair description of this man's licks. I remember seeing the debut of the video for \\"Lay It Down\\" and to this day it remains my favorite Ratt track and DeMartini goes all Joe Perry on ya! \\"You're in Love\\" was an outstanding opener with another hilarious video featuring Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland and Ronald Reagan! \\"Between the Eyes\\" is probably the real unsung tune on the record and has a great verse and melody. The aggression of Pearcy's voice matched very well with the pop sensibility which is why Ratt was able to carve a niche for themselves during the hair metal era.  \\"Closer to My Heart\\" and \\"Give It All\\" and \\"Got Me on the Line\\" are all enjoyable slices of Ratt n' roll and are along with the aforementioned songs why I always like albums one and two about the same. It was after the second that the law of diminishing returns started to catch up to Ratt. Still \\"Invasion of Your Privacy\\" is as glossy and glamorous as a metal album that you would find in the mid-eighties.
B003F4J7LQ|5.0|I like this show a lot, generally speaking. I deliberately avoided it when it first came out because it just seemed so. . .well, teenybopper-ish. I'd roll my eyes and say to myself that the subject matter and the actors belonged on some station that marketed only to teens and young adults, and in a sense, this show did begin that way. Much of its fan base is still in those age groups, and the number of online discussions about how hot the two main actors are can mislead you into thinking this is a throwaway show wherein two hunks basically kill time from episode to episode. Not so. This is a rare situation--one where a show that may have begun with one target audience has blossomed into a show that draws all sorts of viewers who are impressed by its overall excellence.<br /><br />This is the show's fifth season, and each year has seen the acting get even better, the plotlines come together with incredible consistency and intrigue, and I have to say that I look forward to each week's new episode because I know I will find myself impressed by the way the characters continue to be developed, the story fleshed out. The next week's episode is always something I'm plotzing to see.<br /><br />In this episode, Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki) are killed by hunters who want to get rid of the guy (Sam) who got the Apocalypse rolling. Both Dean and Sam end up in heaven (an outcome that takes both brothers by surprise), and what Heaven is, according to the show, is a place where we get to relive our best memories. That sounds simple enough, yes?<br /><br />Heh. Here's one of the reasons I like this show so much. That simple reason leads to some complex and touching scenes and character development.<br /><br />Sam and Dean have had, from the start, an odd family relationship.  Sam never got to know his mother, who died before the timeline of the show started, and Dean became Sam's surrogate father, became the one who took care of him whenever their father took off to hunt demons and otherwise follow his own path to finding the demon who killed his wife, his kids' mom. When the first season begins, Sam is in college, having walked away (in a rough, \\"I don't need you in my life\\" kind of way) from his father and brother to start a life not defined by the hunt for malevolent supernatural beings.  In that first episode, Sam joins Dean once more in the hunt, and from that point to now, the brothers have rarely been separated for any major length of time. They travel the nation together in a wonderful '67 Impala, and they pretty much are each other's support system, their own family unit of two. Even when  their father shows up again in season one, it's clear that Dean and Sam have a closeness that far surpasses anything their own father has built with them. In fact, it far surpasses any intimacy they develop with anyone else. Most of the tension in this show comes from conflict between the two of them, from the differences in their personalities and their approaches to life.<br /><br />The heart of this show is their relationship, but that relationship's foundation is in need of major attention and perhaps a lot of rebuilding. It might even be wise to start over and build a new one.<br /><br />I won't tell you about the God-related aspects of this episode except to say that Dean is disappointed in the outcome of his search for God's help. The way in which that plays out--well, you'll have to see it for yourself. I don't want to spoil that aspect of things for you. I hope that the info to follow in this review doesn't spoil anything for you, either.<br /><br />In this particular episode, we find out what each main character values most. For Dean, the most important memories have to do with his little brother, with his mother (whom he comforts and supports just as he has done for his brother), with the family that is meaningful to him.  All along, he has put one family member or another in top priority place, above even himself and his own well-being, and his memories reflect that. He is the one who provides emotional support to the people he loves, even when he was a child and should have been able to count on them for that support. Dean has never truly been a child; he's been the parent to most of his family, even his father, whom he admired and tried to emulate, something that I still find touching and sad when it crops up in a scene or episode.  Everything that means anything to Dean is contained in a tight little circle of people he loves. For them, he would willingly sacrifice himself (in fact, he has done so already in the course of the show), and for them, he would continue to wake up each morning ready to fight again in spite of his own deep depression and uncertainty. He is, emotionally speaking, in a terrible place when this episode opens, drinking heavily and hoping desperately that God will help him find a way to make the right decision, to help him prevent the horrible bloodshed he sees coming hard and fast towards him and the rest of humanity. (To make matters even harder for him, he not only has the weight of his family on his shoulders; he bears responsibility for saving the entirety of humanity, and in true Dean fashion, he accepts that weight and does his best to bear it even as it threatens to bore him into the ground and bury him alive.)<br /><br />What we find in this episode is that Dean's great memories and Sam's don't match. Sam's  best memories are all about separation from his father and from Dean, although to be fair, it was mostly his father he tried to get away from. He has never looked at his actions as separating him emotionally from Dean.  When Dean sees which memories are special to Sam, he begins to see in a clearer way how disparate their viewpoints about family really are, and it wounds him to his core. His father is already gone, dead because of a deal he made to save Dean's life, and his brother has grown increasingly distant from him, at a time when Dean needs him most and needs to know in his heart that he can count on him. All the times that Dean protected Sam, tried to be a father to him, provided the things that his actual father wouldn't provide because he was off hunting--those all seem to have meant little to Sam. (I think they in fact meant a lot to Sam, but he hasn't put in proper perspective what Dean has sacrificed until now. In this episode, he discovers just how much Dean had to handle in order to keep his family as balanced and safe as possible, and it looks like the first time that Sam realized just how many messes Dean actually had to \\"clean up.\\")<br /><br />What's impressive about all this, at least to me, is how the show has built to this moment. From the start, the characters' emotions and motivations have been consistent, and all the dialogue and plot action has helped to further develop them, to round them out and make them \\"whole.\\" From season one to now, the \\"road\\" has led in a consistent and meaningful way to this episode: Dean is very  nearly at a point where life is no longer worth much to him, where all that once was meaningful now seems to have been part of some illusion he created in his mind and heart. Sam's character, too, has progressed in a logical and consistent way to this point. I love that about this show; one of my pet peeves is when characters suddenly become someone else entirely, when a show loses sight of the person it put out there at the start. \\"Supernatural\\" hasn't done that in five seasons, and I really enjoy that. In season one, in an episode late in the season where Sam is angry that Dean did not let him risk his life to kill the demon who killed their mother, the two brothers fight, and the pain is so clear on Dean's face as he tells Sam that he (Sam) and their father are all he has, that Dean basically can't go on without them.<br /><br />The plot line also has progressed in a logical and consistent way. Whoever's doing continuity in that sense has done a superlativejob. I've rarely felt as though an episode took me outside the world the show had established, and that, too, is unusual for a TV show.<br /><br />The acting has always been superb, and it continues to be so. This episode builds on the excellent foundation that Ackles and Padalecki have established over the course of five seasons; both young men approach their roles with what seems to be complete concentration. They have good chemistry on-screen and off, and it's clear from blooper reels and special features on DVD sets that they can have fun as themselves but them become complete professionals on set. I hope that at some point Mr. Ackles will receive the recognition he deserves for crafting as fine a character as can be crafted on a TV show.on him.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|I already have too damn many dvd's that I have also replaced with blu-ray. Just the blu-ray please, no dvd, no digital copy and lower the price!
6305678715|5.0|THE BEST Mark Harmon movie ever!! He is fantastic in this. NCIS fans will not want to miss this. Sean Connery is good as always, though it's somewhat hard to believe he's an American Army officer. Meg Ryan is adorable but a little quick to jump into the psyhological stuff (not her fault, she didn't write it). But Mark Harmon outdoes himself. It's so good, they should have made a sequel.
0307454541|3.0|The middle -in which the central mystery gets investigated and solved- pulls you along, but the beginning and ending sections (dealing with the financial shenanigans) are interminable. It may be popular but it is definitely not a \\"literary sensation.\\"  The story will probably work fine as a movie with judicious editing.  Please oh please shorten the \\"person goes to Europe, wears disguises, goes to banks, uses computers to steal money from the bank accounts of bad guys\\" scenes.  We've seen them before.  Many times.  There is no romanticism in this book, or lust, really. Emotionally, it's very sterile; whatever the characters do is motivated by logic. Everyone has sex with the main guy just to pass the time or to be his friend.  And for heaven's sake, how many cheese and pickle sandwiches can a hero eat in one book?
B0034JKZ86|4.0|It was a slow burn. When we watched The Princess and the Frog first last week, my 7 year old had shadow man induced nightmares. I think that Dr. Facillier is the scariest Disney villain yet. All those shadows creeping around every corner look and act like demons.     The movie grew on my oldest daughter and me. At first, we both had attitude that Tiana was not only not a princess, but was poor and struggling. She had a problem with Charlotte because she was a spoiled little rich girl, but I thought she was painted with such broad strokes that you had to love her. Then I had a problem with the alligator and the lightning bug. Those accents were a bit much to take, and hadn't we already gone there in the Jungle Book with a buffoon named Louis?    And don't even get me started on the weird spirituality of Mama Odie. So, the shadow man did bad voodoo, but Mama Odie did good voodoo? Whaaat? There's good voodoo?    But lets forget about all that junk and talk about the love story, because that is what captured our hearts.    The frog prince had a very smoove voice, and from the first dialog, \\"a kiss would be nice. . .\\" to \\"Tiana is my Evangeline,\\" he was utterly charming. Tiana was so good, she effortlessly transformed the slothful ladies man into a devoted champion. And she cooked, too? I loved her from the moment she hit the screen.    The special features stank. They left me wanting much more. Where's the making of special? Where's the long-winded discussion of animated brilliance? Why do they think viewers of this movie would love to play a princess game that features other Disney princesses, but not Tiana? Well, my little girls like that game. . .    We must own this one. There is a three disc blue-ray version. That would be the one I'd get.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I preorder this because after owning the planet earth collection im just astounded by how bbc can extract moments of nature onto an amazing visual escape that you don't have to travel far for.there is a choice between oprah or attenborough narrating but i chose his and very anticipated for this bluray experience.
0393072231|4.0|.....people just keep trying to sort this out for the masses i guess!  keep writing and throwing it against the wall and maybe the pundits who don't get it may stop and read one of these books and something will stick.  we have a lot of opinions not worth listening to and are leading the dim bulbs to rally as if they really know what they are talking or writing about.      the quote by Leo Tolstoy explains this for me.      \\"The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of a doubt, what is laid before him.\\"   Leo Tolstoy, 1897    this is why Michael Lewis wrote this book and i enjoyed reading it......never assume you know it all.
B0036EBARO|2.0|With this album, Goldfrapp has removed any trace of masculinity that may have found its way into their prior work, and has made a CD that makes ABBA seem dark.  It's sweet to the point of silliness, and also completely uninteresting.     While I haven't reviewed any of their prior CD's, I would have given Felt Mountain 3.5 stars, Black Cherry and Supernature 4.5 stars, and Seventh Tree 5 stars.  I give this one 2 stars only because the production is competent.      That being said, please buy this album and put it on your shelf to support the band's continued existence.  Maybe listen to it once if you feel that you have to.  This band has made several great CD's and will mercifully move on from this style of music, as they have with their prior styles.  With any luck, it will be great.  And it couldn't posssibly be worse.

B000JMKNV0|1.0|Why is this book two dollars MORE expensive than the paperback version?  That is absurd.  I was coming here to buy this book, but am now spending my dollars with a publisher who doesn't insult my intelligence.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is the best of the whole series. It includes Luke`s mom, Kronos, war, and etc. If u loved the first 4 books, prepare for the book that is heart warming, suprising, and shocking! I could keep going on but I dont want to spoil the book.
B001EIOOWC|4.0|Viggo Mortensen was worthy of an Oscar too bad he was competing against Daniel Day Lewis for There Will Be Blood.  Through the movie, you would see the man doing what he was told but yet you see his feeling of guilt while performing his duty as \\"The Driver.\\"  Loyalty comes a long way when it comes to the Russian mob especially using tattoos to enhance his resume.  I wish Armin Mueller Stahl was nominated as well for Best Supporting Actor category.  Either way the film reflects loyalty, father/son devotion, and especially what does it take to do the right thing.  Other than that the fight scene in the shower is my favorite scene because I am surprised who won every time I watched it.
B002RAREAK|4.0|I say that in the title because this album is not bad...at all. Now, is it a great album, or his greatest!? Absolutely not. But there is a nice vibe to this album and there are some really good tracks on here. My suggestion would be to listen to the album at least 3 times before making a final judgement. I think it will grow on you. Usher still keeps true to himself as well as keeps it fresh. And you can't fault him for that. Don't compare it to other R&B albums out here in the game, especially not younger artists. I think Usher gave us who he is as an artist AND good music. It's a good chill album and it does have a pretty good flow. Now, there are some songs on the album, (probably about 2-3) I could definitely do without. But for the most part, it was good...it's a good buy.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|lehane leads you in one direction and then yanks you in the opposite direction. the book is divided into days. whenever a new day starts you can take everything you know and throw it out the window. the books catches your attention in the middle of the first chapter when teddy actually sets foot on shutter island. from there you follow him willingly through this literally insane mystery
B0000542D2|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about \\"A Hard Day's Night\\"? I bought this because it is one of my favorite movies, and I wanted to share it with my 9 yr old daughter so she could see a glimpse of what Beatlemania was like back in the day. The extras are great - very informative. Highly recommended!

0743233832|5.0|I first read Marcus Aurelius when I was 14 years old.  I didn't really understand it, but it was clear that the book was worth re-reading when I got older.  In the four decades since, I've reread the book many times, in many different translations.  I don't read Greek, so I cannot say how accurate the translation is, but as a reader, Scot and David Hicks have produced the best English translation available.  Their translation does an excellent job of conveying the \\"spirit\\" of the text.  If Marcus Aurelius had written in American English, I suspect his words would read very much like this translation.<br /><br />Buy copies for your friends and family, especially young ones.  The world could use more Stoic virtue.

1843793792|5.0|Produced by Naxos Venetia features lovely musical accompaniment from their large catalog of classical music.   The story of Venetia is set in the English Regency Period and has always been one of Georgette Heyers favorite novels. This is a story of an unconventional romance, which is full of lively dialog & charming characters. Smart, confident, beautiful, naive,  and funny Venetia will soon be one of your favorite heroines. Enter the 'RAKE' Lord Demerel, charming, charismatic, experienced older man into this quiet rural closed society and nothing remains the same...Do you love a 'happily ever after' story - well Heyer delivers as always.      Richard Armitage immerses himself into this story creating some of the most interesting voices and personalities. His characters will often make you smile and chuckle.   He is a real talent, so much so that I found myself forgetting about the unforgettable narrator and just immersing myself into this charming story.   This is my second Heyer narrated by Mr. Armitage with the first being Sylvester, which I also recommend.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Couldn't stop laughing & groaning... but it felt so right! The special effects are completely drowned in the unending string of \\"almosts\\" that Cusack & Co. squeak through while others just mindlessly perish around them. Worst of all: The icky treacle of \\"love\\" moments b/t the odd & sundry future of humanity. These are the people that will re-populate Earth? Oy! By the time the full-on POSEIDON ADVENTURE calamity was in full swing - hope had long been abandoned.
B002HREKCI|1.0|I read this book because alot of the teenager girls in our youth group had been reading it. I thought it had a good story and really could have challenged alot of teenagers to pay attention to how they treat ppl. HOWEVER....the book is full of smut! This book makes me so mad! It takes all this sexuallity and makes it seem like it is normal. It tells teenagers that normal kids have sex, feel each other up, go \\"all the way\\" all the time and it's just a part of life. This book throws purity OUT THE WINDOW. I finally got so upset with the book that i took it to my fire pit and lit it on fire. i wanted it gone. PARENTS: Do not let your children read this book. It is full of JUNK. If you are trying to help  your teenagers protect thier purity, you will buy a copy of this book and burn it, just to make sure no one EVERS gets that book.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Even if Discovery wanted an English speaker from the U.S., they still missed the mark.  I, too, have nothing against Oprah Winfrey, but she is not the voice this stunning video needed.  Good lord, Mike Rowe of \\"Dirty Jobs\\" is already on their team and a professional voice talent.  Ms. Winfrey sounds like she needs a decongestant, and the script is so infantile.  Looking forward to hearing David Attenborough's version.  I won't be watching any more with Oprah's narration; its too disappointing.  My one star rating is for the video work.  It is fabulous!

The whole is technically good, but the edition... lakcs of anything, i asume is the editor the problem and no the director, but is always the posibility that the director gives the poor guy nothing more to put on it!!.    It remember me the first movie of an student. The story may be good, but bad told!!

0307266303|5.0|I'm a fan of outdoor adventure literature, a very mediocre runner, fascinated by the limits of human performance, and an omnivore for tales about different human cultures.  This book was as slam dunk win on all fronts.<br /><br />Having struggled through 3 marathons in my life, I found McDougall's tales of men and women that could knock off over a hundred miles of running in a day eye-popping and mind-boggling.  McDougall's writing style is engaging, just a touch smart-alecky, and at times a tiny bit over the top, which is a perfect match for the bizarre characters, outrageous tales of human endurance, and mind-blowing landscapes of the high Rockies and the Copper Canyon described in the book.<br /><br />Far from an almanac-like catalog of race results, McDougall runs the reader down all sorts of trails, from nutrition, to the wonders (in his opinion) of barefoot running, to anthropological discussions regarding the Tarahumara Indians, with multiple off-the-cuff but humorous observations about human life in general thrown in free of charge.<br /><br />Whether intentionally or not, McDougall makes a powerful case that human life itself is dramatically enhanced when one wanders out to the fringes of society.  Oatmeal and PBJ's will keep you nourished, but the real pleasure in eating (and metaphorically in life) starts up when you add the salsa, the spices, the curries, the mysterious sauces.  In running, and in life, McDougall seems to suggest in this page-turning thriller, non-fiction gem, the fun doesn't even begin to start until you've not only pushed the envelope, but smashed out of it completely.<br /><br />A great read, a great gift for any runner, and a bit of a mind-blower for any sports fan, Born to Run is the best book on running, by a mile, that I've encountered to date.
0061767581|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  i was somewhat skeptical at first because I did not expect much from Lauren Conrad, but she proved me wrong big time!!!!  The way it ended made me want more.  It made me laugh, get mad, & feel happy.  I have even gotten a few of my friends to read it.  It was impossible for me to put down.  I finished it in ONE DAY!!!!!  I was pleasantly surprised.  I will most defintely read Sweet Little Lies!!!!!!!!  (:
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I've seen several of Michael Jackson's concerts over the years by satellite or DVD.

B002WCLG3O|4.0|First off, it's Halo, so you know it's good. Just don't expect non-stop gunfights and Jackal killing. Most of the episodes are REALLY weird and steeped with Japanese culture. (Ever seen an elite in a kimono?) I'd say that if you like anime and Halo, then you'll like this. If you like Halo but not anime, I'm not so sure. But I can assure you that everyone will love the last episode! It is AMAZING and my words can't do it justice. I would buy this dvd just for the last episode.
6303979882|5.0|This movie is fun for mothers and daughters to watch and laugh.  Good slumber party movie for teens.  Good movie for baby boomers--lots of good old days to laugh at and to see Rosie O'Donnell, Melanie Griffith, Demi Moore, and Rita Wilson in this movie from the \\"olden\\" days is fun.  I had never heard of it until recently when I bought it, and was pleasantly surprised.  Good coming of age movie--some serious parts, like real life, and some very funny parts too.  Two thumbs up!

0891419195|5.0|Military history is one of my greatest interests and I have read extensively about the second World War. This book is by far the best first-person account of battle I have ever read. It recounts, with vivid horror, the experience of being shelled day and night for months; the animal sounds of two men fighting to the death in a foxhole; the misery of sleeping in the mud and rain for two months; US Marines using their KBar knives to knock gold teeth out of the mouths of still-living Japanese soldiers; the hundreds of dead bodies, all infested with maggots, rotting all around you for weeks and nothing to be done about it as the action was continuous; the Marines turning into animals, rather than men, in their treatment of the wounded and dead Japanese.<br />You will most likely not read a more horrifing and vivid account of battle.<br />And in the end, \\"Sledgehammer\\" keeps saying how it is all such a waste of life, and for what? He is greatly disturbed by the carnage but fights on.<br />You cannot put this book down.
1608201236|5.0|Lanyon has hinted that this may be the last Adrien English mystery (at least for some time).  Though I'll miss the character, that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Remember how ludicrous it became that Jessica Fletcher stumbled across so many murder mysteries in that tiny, little New England town!?  What made Adrien so appealing to me was he was an ordinary guy who often ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time.  But that can happen only so often before a reader can no longer suspend their disbelief.  If this is the finale, it was very satisfying - leaving the character and the reader in a good place.<br /><br />This is first a mystery series, but this last installment has a good deal more romance and personal interaction than the previous four.  That is actually what made it such a good series-closer.  This book is not for people new to the series - it does not stand alone well as the previous mysteries did.  There is too much \\"baggage\\" a reader needs to understand Adrien's issues.  Adrien's love life has been as messy as his cases, and we finally get some closure on that front.  The case was well-suited to the increased romance as well.  A fifty-year old body doesn't leave too many witnesses alive, which narrows the investigation and made the mystery more straightforward than usual.  So Adrien could shift between contemplating the case and his relationships, without either suffering.  They find the villain (duh), Adrien makes some long-delayed personal decisions, we get to see old friends from the previous books, and there is just enough left to build new stories on.  Should Lanyon return to the Cloak and Dagger.<br /><br />Adrien is very likeable.  He has a dry wit, and self-deprecating humor about him.  I'd happily read more about him, perhaps in a few years when Lanyon is ready to give him some fresh opportunities to stick his nose in where it doesn't belong. However, if this is indeed the end, I don't feel cheated. Only content.
B000BCE918|5.0|My grandson watches these movies over and over. He loves anything with dinosaurs at this time. I would say \\"Lost World\\" is not as well made as the other titles in this set, but would not want to leave it out of the series.  These movies were most enjoyable viewed on the larger screen tv with surround sound for full effect.

0307387151|5.0|Well, I'm waiting for dinner to be ready, and have been passing my time reading reviews of \\"Atonement.\\"  This has led me to leave one of my own.  I believe the book to be one of the very  best novels I have ever read (and I am a lifetime reading of high fiction).   Very few novels will hold up to repeated readings, but \\"Atonement\\" only grows in one's estimation as one re-reads.  Part one is beautiful, languid, but fascinating.  Part two is horrifying, funny, hair-raising.  Part three is utterly believable and touching.  But it is Part four, set in 1999, which put me away.  Others  have written about the masterful structure, and I don't want to give anything away to unacquainted readers, but as I sped along, I thought, \\"Why in the world are Briony's initials there at the  very end of Part three.  Well, by the end of part four, I damn well knew, and I was almost undone.  I confess I had tears streaming down my face when I realized the brilliance of the  story and structure.  To those of you who haven't read this book yet, I urge you to take the plunge.  What a treat you have in store.
B002VECM6S|4.0|This is one of the most polarizing movies I can recall in recent years.  Most reviewers inject their own political opinions into their evaluation of this movie.  I particularly enjoy how we are treated to a list of \\"Fact-vs-Fiction\\" comparisons to support the conclusion that this movie is not 100% accurate and thus presumably is not worth our time.  Well, I liked it.  I think it was Sandra Bullock's best performance to date, and she deserved an Oscar just as her co-nominees were also deserving of an Oscar.    I am trying really hard to focus on my own reaction to the movie and tune out all the other criticisms I have read.  It works on its own.  The character of Leigh Anne Tuohy is clearly the strongest, and Bullock does a fine job.  She is motivated by her absolute determination to do the right thing.  The character of Michael Oher, as played by Quinton Aaron, is a gentle giant who almost made me cry just to look at him - his face is that beautifully expressive.  Which is good, because he doesn't say much.  The movie is sincere and it feels real to me.  If it plays with the facts, for the purpose of making a movie that is not too long or too complicated and a movie that people will watch, I'm OK with that.  Definitely recommended.
B002U6CJO2|2.0|I am reviewing the DVD release, so I won't comment on Blu-Ray picture quality. As noted by others, the changes to the original film are not earth-shattering, and they aren't all improvements.     New computer generated 3D animation is substituted for some of the old cell animation. But the transitions are jarring. The change is hard to justify. The old animation was good, and the style was more or less consistent.     I personally think the English dubbing should have been re-done. Just something about the Major's voice has always been a little too deadpan. But basically the same old voice tracks are used.     The color of the whole film is shifted toward sepia. Everything is more washed-out and more brown than before. It doesn't look good to me.     I bought the 12\\" laserdisc of GITS when it came out. The first DVD release of GITS was quite good. Maybe you will prefer 2.0, but for me it is change for change's sake. The film is worth multiple viewings, but I'll stick with 1.0, thank you.

B000HEWEE4|1.0|I rented this movie with my wife and we tried to return it to Blockbuster within half an hour of renting it it was so terrible. And we live about ten minutes from the store. If I could post a negative star rating I would and it would probably cancel out all the stars this movie has earned on this rating system. Seriously, they are standing at the same mailbox at different times in history, exchanging letters?!?! Speed was the worst thing to happen to these two actors because everything else they have been coupled in is horrible in comparison. Just my humble opinion. Enjoy!
B002JVWR4U|5.0|I'll say again asI did in the season one comments... This show should have run many more seasons... Doors were opening everywhere...  Joss is briliant as always..

Second only to top fav Eliza Dushku... It sure didnt take long for Summer to be snapped up when the NO-BRAINS in the corner office dropped Sara Conners... Now we have it again the NO-BRAINS have dropped Dollhouse.. DO THEY REALY HAVE A BRAIN IN THEIR STUPID HEADS... PROBABLY NOT and probably dropped Dollhouse for more reality T.V. crap, rubbish & garbage... God help us and thank Heavens I can still get a good book while I wait for another Dollhouse or Sara Conners to turn up... Unlike a lot of people I know where the off switch is when the reality crap is dished up...
030745455X|5.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" book and movie reviewed together<br /><br />By Leo Rivers<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is the first of three published novels by Stieg Larsson, a Swedish writer whose \\"millennium trilogy\\" is a worldwide bestselling series of books all of which have been made into fine films in Sweden. It's actually easiest for me to review both the books and the films together because what I have to say applies to both.<br /><br />First of all, he was, with his lifelong companion Eve, a left-wing activist with a strong interest in neo-Nazi resurgence in Sweden. Just after he turned in his first three novels in what was slated to be a 10 novel series, he died. His two follow-up books \\"the girl who played with fire\\" and \\"the girl who kicked over the Hornets nest\\" are all that we are likely to ever see and now make up what everyone calls the \\"millennium trilogy\\".<br /><br />I don't know what stories he was planning to tell in the next 7 books, the fourth of which is apparently on his laptop. But to approach either the books of the movies you have to understand the first book has a story arc of its own, and the second two books together share a story arc and should be enjoyed as one piece of work. His fictional \\"universe\\" has the backdrop of the \\"millennium magazine\\" run by the protagonist which investigates corporate and governmental corruption in Sweden. The first book has as its storyline a psychologically realistic and rather horrifying tale akin to \\"the silence of the lambs\\". Its original title was in fact \\"the man who hates women\\". The second two books actually have a story arc that is more like a John le Carr&eacute; spy novel in which we gradually see the unfolding of a deep government conspiracy. The feeling tone between the two story arcs are very different and I think the standalone book and film of the first story \\"the girl with the Dragon tattoo\\" is closer to what you actually call art rather than just entertainment writing. The movie is good enough to pay full price for at the theater, the subtleties of the acting I think are going to be lost when this is remade in the United States as it's going to be later this year. The second two movies are rather like a BBC miniseries, absorbing and entertaining but not deeply disturbing as it is the first story. And like I said both the books and the movies are similar in this. They are entertainment grade writing with the advantage of being about something worth reading about.<br /><br />I do want to get into the Controversies around of Lisbeth Salander and actresses who might  play her, as Noomi Rapace did in these three films. I am not one of these people who  fell in love  with her, and have profound feelings about who she is and what she looks like in acts like. One could only shrug and smile when you suspect you are talking to such a person.<br /><br />The first book and movie, A, the second and third books and movies together, a strong B.ull price for at the theater, the subtleties of the acting I think are going to be lost when this is remade in the United States as it's going to be later this year.

B0006ZE7G2|3.0|Pink Floyd is one of the greatest musical artists ever and The Wall one of the all-time best albums. Making the epic rock opera into a film was near-inevitable, but the result was unfortunately less than ideal. It could have been done several ways - as a concert film, a straight movie, a musical, or some combination. Unfortunately, it really did none of these, instead simply playing the music over dialogue-free live action scenes mixed with animation - essentially a long music video before music videos were common. It is thus historically important for prefiguring the MTV crazy by a few years as well as starring the soon to be world famous Bob Geldof, but the film is a failure as both adaptation and on its own terms by any reasonable standard. It was eviscerated by many critics, though some, including Roger Ebert, continue to champion it; the film's reputation seems to keep growing, and it has achieved a cult following. Meanwhile, it remains hotly debated by fans; many, including me, loathe it, and even Roger Waters, the album's architect, calls it \\"deeply flawed.\\" However, it has defenders, especially among those favoring Waters-heavy Floyd. All fans should watch it at least once to make up their own mind, and the DVD's generous extras are enough to entice even those who have already seen it, but non-fans should stay far, far away.    Again, I strongly urge all fans to watch, but I will say why the film disappointed me greatly. First I will focus on what is good, as this is very little. Most obviously and notably, a post-\\"I Don't Like Mondays\\", pre-Live Aid Geldof does a surprising strong job - which is important in that he is onscreen the vast majority of the time and indeed nearly the only actor. There are also a few good scenes, notably the fascist rallies and segments of young Pink roaming a battle-scarred countryside. The film also does a convincing job of portraying gradual insanity and gives an interesting, if perhaps not really accurate, inside look at therock lifestyle's most extreme side. And of course the music is great, but there is nothing different from the album other than a few minor mix changes, a couple of well-done Geldof vocals, and the pedestrian \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" since released on multiple Floyd albums.    Now for the bad, which is virtually everything else. The main problem is format; the nature of The Wall makes it easy to see why the filmmakers would not have wanted a straight concert film, though the associated tour was probably the most lavish and visually spectacular ever undertaken. Yet the poor product we get makes this highly regrettable, and the fact that a Wall tour video has still not come out is truly criminal. On the other hand, successfully adapting it to a straight film would probably have been impossible, though it could seemingly have hardly been worse. A musical may have been best; I and many others find them inherently corny, but it again could hardly have failed to equal this. What we get is truly lamentable - a music video that goes on far too long. The concept is probably inherently flawed, but execution is poor even so. With a few minor exceptions, the album is played straight through, and the film ostensibly acts it out. This could perhaps have been done at least decently, but the result is simply atrocious. Perhaps the most fundamental problem here is that this is an \\"in\\" movie to a fault; no one unfamiliar with the album could possibly follow it. The execution is so bad that even the fact of the album playing along to it hardly helps. This is of course irrelevant to fans, but even they should realize how deep of a flaw this is. The problem is mainly due to a bizarre lack of synchronization; the famous Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz sync almost works better despite being unintentional. Many scenes do a very inadequate job of conveying accompanying songs' emotions or even basic sense. Some - e.g., \\"Young Lust\\" - even flatly contradict them. Added elements - such as the infamous rat - are even worse. Perhaps sensing this, the filmmakers threw in seemingly at random an array of sexual imagery and violence without even bothering to connect it. Even scenes that would have seemed nearly impossible to ruin - like that accompanying the \\"Happiest Days of Our Lives\\" line \\"their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them within inches of their lives,\\" which practically anyone could have made hilarious - fall disastrously flat. Waters clearly saw much of this, refusing to allow the reel accompanying \\"Hey You\\" to stand; we thus lose one of the album's best songs. Unfortunately, much of the footage was used elsewhere where it does not even remotely fit. Waters also points out another major flaw - in contrast to the album, the film has no humor; even scenes accompanying songs like \\"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2\\" and \\"The Trial,\\" which are funny on the album, lack it. However, to me, the biggest problem is Gerald Scarfe's animation, which takes up nearly twenty minutes. Strangely, many disagree; some think it the highlight or even the only strength. In my view, though, it is simply stupid beyond measure; the animations are amateurish and the execution shoddy. It rarely has any real connection to the music, and transitions between it and live action are shockingly jerky. The few high points do not nearly compensate for such disastrously fatal flaws, making this in my view not only perhaps the worst rock-related film ever - which of course says much - but one of the worst ever period.    The many extras thankfully make the DVD somewhat more worthwhile; even those who have seen the film previously and hate it as much as me may be intrigued. They include a documentary made at the time that consists mostly of filmmaker interviews and a longer later documentary. The contrast is interesting; the infamous tensions that surrounded the film are clear in the first documentary but mostly gone in the later, letting those involved reflect more objectively. Even more interesting is the contrast between the always brutally honest Waters and the rest, all of whom seem to think they made a masterpiece. There are also several minor extras, including deluxe packaging overseen by longtime Floyd designer Storm Thorgerson. Whether or not all this makes the DVD worth purchasing for those who have already seen the film is of course a very open question.    Fans who have not seen this should watch, if only to say they have, while others should avoid it at all costs unless feeling unusually masochistic. Nothing will save the film, but it did well at the box office, and DVD sales continue to be strong, showing just how far a great album can carry a bad movie.
B00005NFL9|3.0|I really believe that Renee was not right for this role. There are so many great actresses who would have done more justice to this character - Rachel Weisz to name just one. I loved all the other actors and actresses in this film just not her.
B00008PX8P|5.0|It had long been known that a wealth of Led Zeppelin footage existed, making the fact that the subpar The Song Remains the Same was their only live video very frustrating. Led Zeppelin DVD finally corrected this, emptying the vaults to generously give hours and hours of footage containing several dozen songs plus a few rare interview snippets. It will take days for even the most dedicated to go through, including those who have already seen the Mothership teaser. Performances range across the band's career, from very early takes to some of the last. The chronological listing lets us watch the band progress; we see them not only add songs but truly grow as performers, refining solos and ever rearranging and extending old cuts. This is clear even from the array of instruments; on the first performances, Jimmy Page has a few guitars, John Paul Jones sticks to bass, and John Bonham has an astonishingly small drum kit. Soon, though, Page has multiple guitars, Jones a plethora of keyboards, and Bonham an ever-growing kit. Yet the truly amazing thing is that the playing is universally strong; songs became more expansive, but performances were always top-notch. A significant percentage of Zeppelin's catalog is represented, not only virtually all the world famous tracks ubiquitously played on radio but also album cuts like \\"In My Time of Dying\\" and \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" that are often even better. Zeppelin also proves again and again that they were one of the world's great cover bands. Anyone who has not seen or heard them live is in for a real treat; they are one of the greatest live acts of all-time. Combining stellar musicianship and superb showmanship, they continually outdid themselves. Even those who know the albums none by note will be exhilarated; Zeppelin was one of the great jam bands, adding extended solos and otherwise altering arrangements. Songs typically ranged from a few minutes over album length to nearly ten times as long. Some were truly never played the same way twice, but Zeppelin was no mindless jam band; no matter how indulgent, the jamming was always interesting and often transcendent. Page's solos were absolutely ferocious, some of the best ever - all the more notable in that they were often improvised.. Jones' bass was often significantly heavier than on album, and he truly went the proverbial extra mile on keyboards. However, Bonham may have had the biggest improvement; astounding as his studio drumming is, his live pounding was near-superhuman. He adds fills in places we would never expect, often significantly improving songs by the strength of his playing alone. And of course we cannot forget Robert Plant; his singing almost never disappointed, and he was consistently able to match albums' range and high notes in stunning contrast to the many rock singers who stumble onstage. It is also a tribute to his showmanship and sheer onstage presence that we never forget him even when he is silent for ten or more minutes during long jams. Plant in particular benefits from video; seeing is truly believing. The other members are also entertaining, and actually seeing a band of course always adds a hard to define but very important element. This is especially true here, as sound and picture quality are very high - less so of course on early videos, but this is unavoidable; later ones, though, are truly great. The interviews are also invaluable, especially as they show a nuanced side of the band that is all too often overlooked. It is easy to dismiss Zeppelin as mindless party animals, but they come off as surprisingly thoughtful and articulate; particularly intriguing is one of Bonham's very few interview bits. Led Zeppelin DVD is nothing less than one of the greatest live videos of all-time and absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in the band.

B000ZN802W|4.0|I finally got to watch Into The Wild last night and was glad I did.  Few movies stick with me for more than a few hours after viewing it.  While I could certainly understand \\"Alexander Supertramp's\\" reasons for wanting to throw away his plastic lifestyle and not follow in his parents' cold and bitter footsteps, I kept thinking how very selfish this guy was.  He completely disappears from the lives of his family members for two years without a word.  Along the way he makes friends but just vanishes from their lives as well.  I saw a young man leaving behind a trail of broken hearts all because of his \\"free spirit\\" and intense yearning to live in the Alaskan wilderness.<br /><br />Anyone who's done studies and research on runaways will find that the vast majority of them come from upper middle-class families.  Alexander was about as prepared for life in the wilderness as Bill Gates would be if he went to live in Compton or Baltimore City.  Mother Nature kicked his butt...and then some.  In the end, he learned his lessons and was far less self-assured and cocky. Albeit far too late.  At the end of the movie, the self-portrait photo of the young man who went on this real life adventure was the final heart blow to this strong and poignant movie.<br /><br />Did I like it?  Yes!  But I still think he was a selfish fool.
B0013FBS20|3.0|I did like the digital scenes of an eerily empty and decaying NYC, although how many movies have employed this same device? Everything from the \\"War of the Worlds\\" to \\"Planet of the Apes\\" etc etc. The monsters are quite routine looking, as well. But why are the streets conveniently empty of vehicles so that Will Smith can go speeding down them anywhere he feels like it? And why does he risk taking his dog out with him when he knows the dog is not immune to the killer virus? So, we can have our emotions tugged later on, perhaps? As doomsday movies go, this one isn't too bad. It's just a bit rehashed, though it's based on a book I haven't read, so I don't know how good a job was done on the adaptation. Watchable when you get a moment, but not something you will want to see again, possibly.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Season two of Dexter has that same delightfully psychological edge we came to love and crave in season one! Doakes is hot on Dexter's trail, as Dex tries desperately to always stay one step ahead of him.  Add into the mix, the Bay Harbor Butcher, the FBI, damaged Debra, and emotionally needy Rita and you have quite a delicious recipe. The icing on this cake is the introduction of Lila, Dexter's new N/A sponsor.    Dexter's personal \\"graveyard\\" has been discovered. Now he must help Metro Police and the FBI try and catch....himself.  What a quandry our favorite serial killer now finds himself in.  It certainly has us on the edge of our seats as Dexter plans each of his moves ever so methodically, sometimes just barely evading detection. Our boy is a master chess player with each and every move he makes!     The storyline for season two is taut,  tense, and tight!  Just when you think there is no way Dex can get out of a particular dicey situation, he surprises you! We also learn a bit more about Dexter's past and what may drive his passions for his unusual selection of recreational activities.  Season two is equally as enjoyable as season one.  I'm so looking forward to a third helping of this wickedly delicious indulgence known as Dexter!      ~ jade ~

630522885X|2.0|Having taken a day trip to Nevada City, Ca., I was surprised to learn that Lola Montez had lived there and the house is still standing. There are also a couple of plaques in the town commemorating her living and entertaining there. Since I was pretty fascinated about her life and ended up reading alot about her life. Unfortunately the movie does not show her life at all in California and only mentions it. This was the main reason I rented it on Netflix but was very disappointed with it. I think someone out there could do a much better job. I realize this was in France in the 50's but it was done way too artsy and symbolic.

0393075966|3.0|No one does it better than Stiglitz, explains the unexplainable.    But the ONLY reason I am writing this review is to complain.      Complaint #1:  There is NO INDEX!!    Complaint #2:  The last three chapters are titled:   chapter 8: From Global Recovery to Global Prosperity   chapter 9: Reforming Economics  chapter 10: Toward a New Society.    How I looked forward to reading those chapters, I was hoping to see a recipe for recovery, even an executive summary that a busy President Obama (and his Paulson-lite Treasury Secretary) would have time for.    THIS (\\"With median household income already down some 4 percent from 2000, there is no choice: if we are to preserve any sense of fairness, the brunt of the adjustment must come from those at the top who have garnered for themselves so much over the past three decades, and from the financial sector, which has imposed such high costs on the rest of society.\\") is buried on page 291, the last pages of the last chapter.   But if you are not careful you won't even see it.    Stiglitz is more capable than anyone of nailing it, of proposing real solutions to real problems.  It's a crying shame that he chose to downplay them by not including a 3-5 page RECIPE FOR THE FUTURE.

It was in this recording that i first paid attention to the string section, more closely even then George Martin's Beatles repertoire!<br />Paul Buckmaster has remained one of my favorite musical icons - up there with Schubert and Chopin and Mingus and Monk. Anything he touches is of vital interest, and should as well be to any music lover/appreciator who wants to be enlightened, educated, lifted...<br />I had found this album in the trash, along with some other soon-to-be classics in the Classic Rock/Pop genre, and it's by far the highlight of the bunch. what a surprise, and a gift that i've cherished all my life. How someone could part with such vinyls is beyond me, but obviously i was meant to find them there in the dumpster, in the middle of winter, with snowflakes pouring down from the sky. EJ's Tumbleweed Connection release comes a close second (especially Love Song and Talking Old Soldiers), but this - THIS - is Elton John at his finest - poppy, yet strikingly different.<br />Track 5 (First Episode...) and Track 10 (The King...) are especially recommended!

B00328G4XY|5.0|When reviewing record albums you often read, \\"I hear something different everytime I listen to it\\". Well there are no more than a handful of records that I can say actually evoke that sentiment within me. The ones that readily come to mind are \\"Astral Weeks\\" by Van Morrison, \\"Blonde On Blonde\\" by Bob Dylan and \\"A Salty Dog\\" by Procol Harum. But the one that really sets me on my ear with every listening is surely Jimi Hendrix's masterpiece \\"Electric Ladyland\\". From the opening slo-mo intro of \\"And The Gods Made Love\\" to the astounding psychedelic shock and awe of \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\", Jimi and Company are hitting on all cylinders. Not only did Jimi Hendrix evolve into a first rate songwriter with works like \\"Voodoo Chile\\", \\"Gypsy Eyes\\", 1983 (A Merman I Should Turn To Be)\\" and \\"Rainy Day, Dream Away\\", but his unique interpretation of Bob Dylan's \\"All Along The Watchtower\\" rivals the original for sheer passion and verve. And the outstanding ensemble playing by \\"The Experience\\" with guest artists Steve Winwood, Buddy Miles and Chris Wood all combine to make this the true classic it has become over the years.    Yes, I not only never tire of the magnificence of \\"Electric Ladyland\\", but I wonder at its ability to constantly provide me with new insights and fresh ideas. It's been said that Jimi and Chas Chandler, the man most responsible for introducing the world to this extraordinary talent, were both huge science fiction buffs. Dig their extraterrestrial chatter on the leadup to \\"EXP\\" (the opening track of Axis Bold as Love). Perhaps that explains Jimi's unworldly gifts. Maybe it was the intergalactic gods that sent him to earth to save the world from the sorry state of affairs of pop music before Jimi rose to fame. Afterall how else can you explain the way top-forty music went from The Archies, \\"Sugar Sugar\\", The Monkees \\"Daydream Believer\\" and all that other 1910 Fruitgum Comany crap to \\"Are You Experienced\\" and \\"Electric Ladyland\\"?.....\\"And The Gods Made Love\\" and so Jimi was born......And with that creation we would surely \\"Never Hear Surf Music Again\\"!
B0033AX26I|5.0|I heard about this album on NPR a few weeks ago and found it fascinating.  The combination of cultures blends beautifully into an album that any Irish or Latin fan would love (I happen to be both!!).  the artists are terrific, and the songs compelling.     I am of Irish decent, and married to a Latina.  I also am a history buff, so I was reminded of how little I knew of the San Patricio.  Hopefully this album will spark people to remember and study this unique event in American History.    I read a review that rated this album a single star.  That person is way off base, as their criticism has to do with their personal feelings and not the artistic and historic content of this album.    Definitely worth a listen.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|Does a great job of putting you in the shoes of a grunt.  Didn't serve during WWII but have served in every conflict since Viet Nam and he nails some of the experiences.  HIs descriptions of what you see, hear, and smell are dead-on.  Good book and it's on the list of required reading for Marines - and anyone else.
B000003TSP|5.0|While not as perfect as Dummy, this sophomore effort by Portishead is still an amazing album.  I first discovered the trio in the mid-90's, and for whatever reason haven't had the opportunity to listen to their follow-up work until now.  I can't believe I put off buying this terrific album until recently.<br /><br />Their second album is splendid, top-notch production and haunting vocals by Beth Biggons.  If you enjoyed their debut album Dummy, you need to treat yourself today and buy this album.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have bought many of this game for my friends' kids.   They all love more than anything!   It is not a simple board game so grown-ups also can enjoy.   The game works not only with dices(purely luck-based), but also with your smart trading skills.
B002VECM4A|2.0|I must begin by saying that the performances by Monique and Gabby Sidibe are simply unprecedented.  I cannot even begin to understand why Gabby Sidibe did not win the Oscar for this.  My problem with the story and the film is that I am unable to wrap my mind around these events being even remotely possible.  Perhaps I am in denial that such horrors exist but I cannot fathom a life so filled with horror and darkness.  Are there truly such heathens among us?  Do mothers and fathers beat, sexually molest and rape their own flesh and blood?  This has nothing to do with race or religion or political profile; this bears directly down upon the soul and conscience of these human beings we share the planet with.  Do they truly exist?  Are there young men and women living lives as portrayed in this film?<br /><br />All of the horror movies combined cannot hold a candle to the absolute terror that is this film.  These are the things that truly do go bump in the night.  These are the monsters under the bed; the witches in the closet; the vampires that lurk in the shadows.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie.  It is a disturbing spear that penetrates the heart and murders the spirit.  Do we turn our backs on such occurrences?  Absolutely not.  Rather than spend millions on movies that depict these truths, we should focus our energy on whatever it is that needs to be done to move toward the rescue of our most precious natural resources: our children.  I read books and watch movies to be entertained.  I was not at all entertained by this film.  It was a stark jolt of reality that left me filled with despair, regret and heartbreak.  And perhaps that is the ultimate intent.
B0019LY5IM|1.0|I purchased this for my father for Christmas.  I did not open the package before giving it to him; lesson learned.  The DVD's were open and scratched.  They were in such bad shape that he couldn't watch the first two.  He went out and purchased the product again at a retail store.  I then contacted who I purchased the product from and never heard anything back from them.  I requested a new set, but nothing.  Horrible vendor.

B0033AX26I|4.0|This album is uneven, but when it's on, it's on, and the most pleasurable songs are the ones that combine the Irish and Mexican/Latin components the most seamlessly.  The way to achieve this in most cases has been to dial up the Latin and dial down the Gaelic, but like a black and tan that's more Dos Equis than Guinness, it's a strange combination that somehow goes down smooth.  While some of the vocals were interesting, and most were evocactive, I think it was the instrumentation that I found most appealing.  It is surprising how naturally pipes and strings blend within the swirling bouyancy of complementary percussion.  Not every song is a gem, but there's enough here to make this a worthwhile addition to your collection, and further evidence that Ry Cooder has an ear for music that the mainstream might otherwise miss.  This effort comes nowhere near the standards set by his magnum opus, [[ASIN:B000005J56 Buena Vista Social Club]], but it still represents the sort of passion for novelty and exotica--not strictly for its own sake, but as a way of awakening the musical imagination--too often missing from more obviously commercial productions.
0316044938|2.0|I was truly expecting more from this book.  It took me in in the beginning, but started falling short about the middle.  I saw the movie also and to me it would be a toss-up as to which is better!
0060734191|4.0|This is a great starter fantasy series. The action is always involving and exciting with with only a lapse here and there throughout the 3 books. Its like Harry Potter meets Dawn of the Dead. If you want a fantasy series to keep you busy till the next Robert Jordan/Brandon Sanderson novel or George R.R. Martin novel, this will do the trick.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I like toons with a story, even when far from reality. Lots of LOL scenes in UP and some sad ones too.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|In \\"The Proposal,\\" Sandra Bullock goes against her usual girl-next-door roles and plays Margaret, a no-nonsense Manhattan publishing executive her employees affectionately refer to as \\"Satan's Mistress.\\" Unfortunately for Margaret, she's a Canadian whose visa is about to expire, and so she ropes her assistant, Drew (Ryan Reynolds), into agreeing to marry her. The fake couple carries their scheme all the way to Drew's home state of Alaska, where they inform Drew's family of the news and continue the fiasco all the way to the altar.<br /><br />I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did, but Bullock and Reynolds are hysterical. The film also boasts a great supporting cast, including the sassy Betty White as Drew's outlandish grandmother. \\"The Proposal\\" is a hilarious romantic comedy that I will definitely want to purchase on DVD and watch again and again.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|In 1966 I was watching UK TV programme Top Of The Pops and on came The Jimi Hendrix Experiance with Hey Joe.  Jimi playing his guitar behind his back and with his teeth was sensational to say the least, in fact the whole performance was outstanding.  Missing tracks, I would have liked to had Like A Rollin' Stone and Sergeant Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.  2 of my choices here are Purple Haze and If 6 was 9.  However 3 others are some of the best rock music ever recorded, the aforementioned Hey Joe, the slower and considered The Wind Cries Mary and the barnstorming All Along The Watchtower.  Thanks Jimi.
0374530718|4.0|Sophie's world lives up to the expectations set by previous reviews and critiques. For someone who didn't know the difference between Socrates and Plato, this book not only set me straight but eductated me far beyond the ancient Greek philosophers. I highly recommend this book.    Enjoy!
B000001ZS3|5.0|Mike Oldfield's Tubelar Bells from 1973 may well have started the ambiant music genre, but I not so sure it's stood the test of time.  In contrast Oxygene from 1976 is intriging while still being melodic, unlike some offerrings from Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream.  It is easy to play all the way through, although Oxygene (IV) was a very successful single which alerted me the this album in the first place.  Maybe not quite as groundbreaking as Wendy Carlos' 1968 Switched On Bach, Oxygene set the scene for eletronic music to be more widely accessed and enjoyed.
B001M3LG84|5.0|This again as always is a SUPER DVD. We love ANDRE RIEU and his Johann Strauss Orchestra and Choir. He always makes all his music so enjoyable and gets the whole audience involved which is superb!! We watch his DVDs over and over again and thoroughly enjoy them every time.
B002VECM4A|5.0|Precious by Sapphire is a biographical fiction, based on a fourteen year old black teen, Pregnant for her second time by her father and fearing for her life. Throughout her life she has been sexually, physically and mentally abuse by both her mother and father. Her first was a child born with down syndrome, and was given away by her abusive mother to Precious grandmother. Throughout the story Precious is pregnant with the second child.   The novel Precious by poet and author Sapphire is a disturbing look at the life of an illiterate victim. The author uses poor grammar to portray Precious accent, and poor communication skills. Sapphire really dramatically brings the book to life by using discrete, violent, explicit language. Themes that are applied in the novel are achievement, determination, faith and strength. Precious uses all of these by pushing herself to graduate school and by pursuing her dreams of moving away from her mother with her children.   When Precious gets the opportunity to go to an alternative school she meets Ms.Rain who does everything in her power to help Precious pursue her goals. A passage that had strong imagery was when Precious explained the time when she was seven years old and her father continued to have sexual intercourse with her. Please be aware that this book is violent and disturbing in some chapters, this book is not meant for children. Only adult should read this book, I recommend this story if you enjoy reading about real life dramas.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|This CD blew me away! I liked Gorillaz, Demon Days, G-Sides and D-Sides, but they just can't hold a torch to this release! The production is fantastic, the riffs, loops, vocals, and everything about the music fantastic. There isn't a song here I dislike. Rhinestone Eyes is the best offering here, followed closely by Empire Ants (I absolutely love the vocals of guest Yukimi Nagano and her band Little Dragon). Do yourself a favor, and buy this CD today, you will not be dissapointed!
B0034JKZ86|1.0|I had heard there was a bit of voodoo in the storyline.  That was a huge understatement.  The story was filled with voodoo and creepy shadow people (demon looking people with screamy voices).  The voodoo man ends up being dragged off to a place like Hell.  This was not very kid friendly at all, and honestly I was very surprised that the main storyline of this show was all about the voodoo man tricking the prince.  Good does win in the end, but this movie was just way to dark to be marketed for kids.  I was really disappointed in it.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I purchased Susan Boyle's CD with great anticipation. Her voice just sent shivers down my spine, her words were understandable, not screamed into a microphone.  While her voice is beautiful, the music behind her nearly overcomes her. She does not need a full orchestra with amplifiers behind her. She might discuss a little less music behind her on her next CD. We should be able to hear her singing not being overrun by the background music.
B000006UNF|5.0|When this band first appeared on the scene a lot of critics put them down for being a Genesis rip-off. Peter Gabriel's response to this was to put Marillion on one of his tours to open for him. Like him, I recognized them for what they were: a unique and worthy version of early Genesis-like music. Like other sound-alike bands such as Starcastle they never got the praise they deserved. As an example of this, I went to a Marillion concert once where they had to move it to a much smaller venue because there was only a few dozen or so tickets sold. They just never got big enough in America to earn a large following here. If you are a fan of Gabriel-era Genesis give this band a try. I suggest you start with \\"Script for a Jester's Tear\\". To me it is their best album.
1932100660|5.0|Campbell's \\"The China Study\\" is a compelling, easy to read, understandable warning that the ordinary American diet, supported by official science and industry, is hazzardous to your health. Most of us grow up thinking that our fate is primarily genetically determined and somewhat affected by our environment and diet. \\"The China Study\\" changes your mind fast with irrefutable evidence that you really are what you eat. If you are willing to make the changes that Campbell recommends you can change your fate and live a long,fulfilling productive life. This is a must read for the health conscious who plan on enjoying their lives for a long, long healthy time!
B001OQCV2O|4.0|If you have a home theater, this is a definite must have.  The special effects and sound are great and they just beg to be unleashed on a massive scream and big surround.  This is who this movie is for, though.<br /><br />It's entertaining but not engrossing, the plot details are cliche and boring, and there's not much substance to it.  But boy when you see the world collapsing, you'll be glad you bought this on BD!<br /><br />If you have the equipment, this is a must have.  If you're watching on anything close to normal, no surround, or lack HD, I'd keep this squarely in the \\"rent\\" pile.

1591841666|4.0|In this mini-book, Godin uses his direct and engaging writing style to help us think about \\"success\\" and how we define it for ourselves. He admits in the beginning that there is nothing earth-shaking about this wisdom, but it can shake your world if the timing is right for you. The subtitle is about strategic quitting. Often our failures are in how we defined the boundaries of our goal - too small or too large. The \\"Dip\\" is that time and place between initial excitement of an endeavor and the real accomplishment of it - however you define that success. It's generally a not-so-great feeling. Godin shows us eight types of dips that we need not only to survive, but be able to make the challenges work for us in the long run. I could easily see myself in one or more of the seven reasons we quit rather than struggle through the Dips to our goals.  Understanding why it is hard to quit things that aren't right is more than just being comfortable in our misery.  If we can step back to see the bigger picture, we need to quit the right things or not start them to begin with.  Focus. There is a powerful list of the `right' questions to ponder at any stage of a Dip. Thanks, Seth, for sharing this wisdom.
0446691437|5.0|If you're looking for the words to motivate and inspire your to do your creative work, then you've found the right book.  Pressfield is right.  Overcoming resistance is a war, a war where victory can mean a better world and a better life.

B0002O37RM|5.0|As the sun appears to brightly rise, move majestically across the sky, and slowly set in soft yet blazing colors, this music doesn't hurry. Buoyed by the deep bass, the pure clear horns, and crystalline piano, it shines with transcendent beauty. Sometimes too much speed can obscure the vividness of how things are, and quiet meditation is the path of awakening.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Quick review on the PX21 with pros and cons.    Background: Bought this based on necessity for headset + mic combo. This is a review for the PX21, the replacement for the P21 which as far as I know adds a chrome ring, slightly different physical specs, and supposedly support for stereo (?)    Pros    *Headphones and mic in one item  *Mic is adjustable, very flexible  *Great quality mic, very strong standalone headphone  *Headset itself is pretty flexible, material is very durable  *Cord provided is insanely long  *All sound settings are adjustable on the minimodule  *Mic doesn't pick on breathing too much  *Bass boost (increase bass) and sound expander (increases left and right sound while decreasing middle) are nice   *Support for PS3, Mac, XboxLive, and PC  *Game at night, or quietly!    Cons  *Headphones wont fit those with larger ears  *Sound static can be heard when nothing is going on (this is drowned out by game noise)  *The mic doesn't seem to be long enough for some facial structures  *Setup is convoluted; my PS3 looks like an octopus  *Still no support for surround sound (this would probably make it +50 bucks)  *Requires you to use the RYW wires, HDMI cable only used for visual  *Cord is insanely long  *Sound leaks out to environment... people around you WILL hear what's going on    Overall, the pros far outweigh the cons. The cons are really specific but will make the overall experience worse if you do possess these facial features/structures. If you're looking for a headphone + a mic, this is pretty much the only product on the market that supports Playstation Network (the other one is the Tritton AX Pro, which does support 5.1 Dolby but is about $160)    Oh yeah, no matter what sort of design... you will look geeky, especially with the mic.
B002X20W2E|5.0|This album is a great step up for Rihanna, and she sings every song with passion, and brings her singing to all new levels. There are some dance songs for those looking for that out of this album, but to coincide with other reviews, overall this album is pretty dark. Also on that note, while this album is dark, it is empowering, especially for females, and gives a sense of just how strong of a woman Rihanna is.
B002ZG9788|1.0|I also watched and loved the original Clash of the Titans, and, I really wanted to like this adaption.  unfortunately, it relied almoste entirely on special effects, and fell far short on story telling.  They not only ruined a great story, but the characters were so unlikeable, that you didn't care if they succeeded or not.  Whoever was responsible for this adaptation, fell far short.  If you have not ever seen the originaly, I highly recommend it.
0316044695|5.0|Lone Survivor is an incredible story of a U.S. Navy Seal pressed against impossible odds, and surviving the tragedy due to both the sacrifice of some of the greatest men who've ever lived, and events common sense will tell you were miracles(the author challenges you to try to think of your own explanations). I put down Marcus Luttrel's account of his fighting against the Taliban never having felt so proud, so inspired, and most of all, so SAFE, knowing there are men like him with us today.    If you're ever feeling scared of America's future(I know I am, after learning of Obama's private army ordeal, and terrorists across the globe) you'll have to search long and hard to find anything any more comforting, then reading Marcus Luttrel's account, and in my case at least, wishing I knew of a single youth with a shred of the integrity found in Seal team 10.    Bottom line- Forget your popular fantasy such as Eragon or Harry Potter. Forget your tacky teen romance novels while you're at it, because Lone Survivor tells a story more riveting, more engaging, and more satisfying then anything that's come out of my bookstore in YEARS.

0307454541|5.0|I just finished Dragon Tattoo, and it deserves the accolades it's received. Before I finished it, I purchased The Girl Who Played with Fire, and I expect I'll buy the third book in the trilogy as well, when it comes out next month.<br /><br />I won't belabor the points made by other reviewers, but I want to weigh in on one of the criticisms that keeps turning up, that the book is \\"secretly a pro-SM, pro-pedophile, etc.\\" tract. The argument goes that Larsson depicts these things while decrying them, but his depictions are obviously \\"meant\\" to be favorable. I'll reserve judgment on Fire, which takes the greater burden of complaint, until I've read it, but anyone who thinks Dragon Tattoo is a hypocritical, \\"ain't it awful\\" porn fest needs to get out more.<br /><br />First off, there are only two acts of sexual violence in the book (the second is in retaliation for the first), over the course of 600 pages. There are no other graphic sex scenes, and although there is a certain amount of open-mindedness about the \\"consensual bondage community,\\" there are no depictions of that either. There are dozens of other crimes against women reported in the book (it is about an insane serial killer), but they are as clinical as a police blotter, and considerably less detailed.<br /><br />The rape is depicted in the book (as in the movie, apparently) as an ugly, nasty, vicious assault on a character that we like very much. To imagine it is approved by the author is the height of fantasy. The rape in the film is generally described as horrifying, to which I would respond, \\"Good.\\" That will balance nicely against all the depictions that suggest it's fun.<br /><br />Someone warned me that the book was brutal, and in hindsight I'd have to say they must not read much crime fiction. Compared to James Ellroy, Thomas Harris, or respectable noir writers like James Lee Burke, Andrew Vachss, and Mo Hayder, this is pretty tame stuff. Again, the \\"brutality\\" happens offstage and is recorded in what amount to news reports.<br /><br />As for the pedophile complaint, it hinges on a strange mental trope. Lisbeth Salander is 25 and looks underage. One of the curses that dumps on her is that people refuse to treat her like an adult. To argue that an adult man accepting her sexual advances (one who treats her like an adult and equal for a hundred pages beforehand) is therefore a pedophile takes some serious gymnastics. Larsson actually tackles that very issue, before Salander and Blomquist begin their affair, as Blomquist endures the hard looks of neighbors who assume she is an underage doxy rather than a working partner.<br /><br />The original title of Dragon Tattoo was Men Who Hate Women. I'm sorry, one can't write about men who hate women without showing them doing some of the hating. To argue that by showing it, the author is implicated in it, is not only bizarre, but it completely ignores the terrible ethical dilemma the protagonist must resolve at the end of the book.or the pedophile complaint, it hinges on a strange mental trope.

B002N8A14M|5.0|I've had it for about a week and have taken it with me every day to work out. It works really well. Great design! I also like the static-cling screen protector that you can place over the screen/buttons once the ipod is in the case. The arm band is comfortable and I feel like my ipod is very secure in the case.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|This is not a teaching; this is an act as in action. The film's base on the Stations of the Cross; creates a Passion Play of great power. It's as close to a time machine as you might get; being plunged into another time zone. Sweet and rougher than usual; it's a great film to see. More horrific also; but redemptive.<br />Blu-ray shows the great design and photography; as well as a powerful soundtrack. Two versions and chapters that reflect the stations, plus a DVD
B000093BDX|1.0|This won't take long.      Speaking humbly (really!) as a musician & longtime (from day 1) in-depth fan of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys:    a) Lousy selection - I could go on forever about the songs picked,     ( I know... -  I KNOW ... it's called 'Sounds of Summer - where in hell is 'All Summer Long' then? )  but the fact that 'Caroline No' and 'Surf's Up' isn't on this  (and the dreaded \\"Kokomo\\" is) -  says it all.     It's like Mike Love's set list from Hell.    b) Mediocre to bad sound - who picked these particular mixes and even worse, chose which ones are in 'stereo' / mono ??  Could have been worse, but not by much (see the Pet Sounds Sessions box set)  http://www.amazon.com/Pet-Sounds-Sessions-Beach-Boys/dp/B000002U4U    c) Liner notes and package = meh!    SUMMARY:    Don't buy this.  There are so many better box sets, anthologies ... if nothing else, just pick up a copy of the original 'Pet Sounds' if you don't have it ... almost *anything* is better than this.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|This show is UNBELIEVABLY FUNNY.  So you can compare your taste to mine, here are the other shows I watch regularly: How I Met Your Mother, 30 Rock, The Office, Parks & Rec, House, Lost, The Mentalist, and 24. With Community, I was hooked from the first episode.<br /><br />What makes this show great?  Rapid-fire wit (emphasis on rapid-fire ... and equal emphasis on wit!), great writing, an innately funny premise that leaves itself open to endless hilarious storylines (the show peeks into the lives of an eclectic, neurotic, lovable, unlikely group of friends at a community college), perfect comedic timing, brilliant characters the likes of which you haven't seen on TV in a long time, and an ensemble cast with real, natural chemistry (their performances are often applause-worthy).  Last but not least, the comedy on this show is INTELLIGENT.  It will appeal to you if you're pop-culturally literate and enjoy smart humor.<br /><br />Community never fails to deliver.  The LEAST funny episodes of this show are still far funnier than most of the standard fare out there.  And the MOST funny episodes of this show will challenge your continence.  Yes, it's really that good.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|I never played Final Fantasy VII before, but had already read a lot of reviews, articles, etc, about it. So, I kind of knew what to expect from this movie. And, my expectations were not frustrated: excellent battle scenes, classical characters and, of course, a special appearance of Sephiroth himself!!! So, if you like Final Fantasy, certainly this is a product you want on your shelf.

B000002UAO|5.0|Whatever was in the air, water, or hookahs in 1965, 'Rubber Soul' translated these vibes into such musical brilliance that listeners would forever be moved. How else can you explain the power and originality of these tunes? Not that the Beatles were mere channels, but somehow they tapped into a deeper consciousness that pushed the realm of popular music way, way beyond the conventional norms of the time. Hell, 'Rubber Soul' stands far beyond the conventional norms NOW! And the same could be said for 'Revolver,' 'Sgt. Pepper,' 'Magical Mystery Tour,' etc., etc. And while drugs had a part to play in their musical experimentation, I don't think you could ever attribute the Beatles' variety and output of ground-breaking work to drugs alone. Instead, it was their innate, unteachable talents that feuled their music -- talents that truly deserved all the hipe and celebrity that surrounded them. This group of four guys, all of who came from very meager backgrounds, had some kind of priceless, interconnected genius that may or may not ever be witnessed again. And while I referred somewhat tongue-in-cheek to the Muses in my review title, who knows whether or not such other-wordly forces had any sway on what was ultimately put down on vinyl. If they did, I just wish the Muses -- whoever or whatever they are -- would return to inspire artists to launch another glorious era of timeless music. God knows we need it.
0307588335|5.0|Richard Fuld's bias for bigness, greed even in disaster, and righteousness in failure distorts the realities of human failure and moral absence. These weaknesses have been captured in Mr. McDonald's fascinating account that won't let you put the book down.  The story is compelling, honest and scary.  It is more than the realization that greed left unchecked once again destroys more than those involved in its acts. Mr. McDonald's book is a significant accomplishment for current and future generations and should be required reading for all Board of Directors, Director's Colleges, Executive Education forums and College Business courses. Mr. McDonald was at the right place, at the right time, did the right things and now tells us how wrong overcame right and hurt so many, so quickly.<br /><br />I saw a board of directors at Lehman Brothers that is a sad and truthful reflection of many companies. Their lack of action to reign in Mr. Fuld forces the reader to wonder where corporate governance really exists.  It forces an incredible inside examination of the reader's courage.  It challenges you from the beginning by placing you in the rooms, seeing the walls, visualizing the tenseness, being on the phone calls, hearing the stress, being in the meetings, witness to un-tempered power, seeing the indicators of abuse, deception and fraud, reporting your concerns and smelling the dung excreted from those entrusted to lead. You know it is real, you feel the forces of being dismissed as a person, and know that Mr. McDonald is right that common sense is absent as well as common dignity. Fuld and his team of cronies including the Board should be seeing each other today through bars. You also see and feel passion, love, respect and friendship and trust that Mr. McDonald received first from his parents and then gave to those he served with and for.<br /><br />There are usually, and understandably, multiple reasons and systemic causes for a total collapse like what happened at Lehman Brothers and Mr. McDonald's account addresses them all openly, honestly and educationally. I received back more value than the cost of the book in the first chapter. Each reader should come away bound by renewed moral principals that ensures where they end is in line with where they began; innocent of corruption, unwaivered by greed and focused on what is right in their success and the success of those they are entrusted to serve and lead.<br /><br />May Mr. McDonald be blessed forever with the strength received from his family, friends and his entrusted readers.

B002JIEYKS|4.0|In 1978 Sabbath had much publicized internal personality and drug/lifestyle problems. To compound things they got little label support (it was all about post punk,and arena rock like KISS, Queen, Aerosmith etc...) and a bad decision to record in Toronto where they rehearsed and fought in frigid temperatures. I am a Sabbath fanatic (really....I was obsessed with them most my adolescence and collect all their stuff), and NSD is one of my absolute favorites. And as time goes on even more so. The songs are much more innovative and varied than on the previous Technical Ecstacy album. Johnny Blade, Juniors Eyes and Swinging The Chain may be the most fully realized tracks they ever recorded to my mind. Some jazzy diversions in tracks like Airdance and Breakout only show them going back to what they used to be- a jazz-influenced rock and blues band. You can hear Brian May's influence on Iommi's tones and layered guitars. The only thing I would change is the production. It is rather boxy and midrangy and hollow sounding at times. Sometimes it works to great effect, other times I wish I could get my hands on the mixer and EQ and really fill  it out. Great material though.  A crime to overlook. Go go go and buy it I say!
B002GU5V24|4.0|I have been wanting this set for awhile. However after reading the reviews about the glitches on Seconds Out, I have been holding off on getting it. However, this was given to me as a birthday present and Seconds Out which is my favourite live Genesis album was the first CD I put in. And not only it sounded great, there were no glitches whatsoever!! So I guess Rhino had FINALLY got the problem fixed and I lucked out!! The only bummer I have to point out is that there are no interviews with the band about the albums on this set like on the other ones which was why I only gave it four stars instead of five!! Other than that, they did an excellent job on the remixing like on the other sets!! If you are a true Genesis fan like myself, and want to finish off your box set collection, this is a must have!!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I have loved the version of \\"Emma\\" with Gwyneth Paltrow for years, and watch it from time to time.  When I saw this was on PBS, I wanted to watch, but was afraid it might change my view of the story in a negative way.  It is much longer, which can be a bore at times, but in this case, it really just makes the story clearer and explains some things that were missing in the version I had seen before (I hadn't read the book!).  I LOVED this version.  I loved the detail, the characters, the actors, everything about it, and knew I had to order a copy to watch again and again!
0684874350|5.0|Most focus on the darkness of this novel (as sadly did the movie), but to me it represented the ability to find humor in the darkest days.  I read this book and thought it was really funny.  I lived outside the US at the time in an underdeveloped country and my work mates thought it depressing.  I thought - it must be me.  Later, I asked my mom what she thought (being the child of Irish Americans who were born at the turn of the 20th century).  She thought it was funny.  I then chalked it up to my family having an odd sense of humor or just my own maligned memories of my childhood visiting with my super elderly Irish great aunts and uncles in New York/Newark who had a similar sense of humor.  I then returned to the US and began to work with another Irish American, older than I, whose Irish-American wife read it.  She thought it funny too.  Then I realized that it must be an Irish American thing, this odd, dry sense of humor even in the worst situations. So, conclusion is that if you don't like a dry sense of humor in the face of very difficult times, then this book isn't for you.  But if you can find humor in the more dire of circumstances, this book is absolutely for you. Good reading.

0671015206|4.0|The stats are from 1996, which makes the book somewhat dated.  Nevertheless, I think the theories derived from them remain valid even today.  The anecdotal illustrations are interesting and sometimes humerous.  It would be really interesting if the authors updated it and expanded to allow references to the major economic swings since 1996.
B001UV4XWY|1.0|I'll try to keep this one short, but basically...    SKIP THIS ONE.    Some may be tempted to get this film because it's categorized as \\"Sci-fi\\".  Others may want to see it because it was directed by the creator of Donnie Darko, or because it's based on a story by Richard Matheson....  A few may even want to see it because of Cameron Diaz.    Please, don't let any of those reasons cause you to make yourself sit through this.    Trust me....it's bad.    Acting-   very fake and melodramatic acting from Cameron Diaz...below \\"phoned in\\" status...makes it hard to sit through an entire film when the main actress is doing this much bad acting    Music-   I would say this is the worst soundtrack music for a Hollywood studio film that I have ever heard. It was shockingly bad, \\"Mickey Mouse\\" music that was so awkwardly wrong that it made all the scenes in this bad film MUCH WORSE. I just wanted this soundtrack to end, but it wouldn't     Goofball scenes with bad acting extras pretending to be scary-   The angry \\"librarians\\" chasing the people through the library had me cracking up laughing, rather than scared...  the old lady who answered every question with \\"eternal damnation\\"...  sorry, it was simply funny, not scary, in this film.     That also goes for the weird \\"goth\\" like student in the classroom who demands to see Cameron Diaz's feet, and who continues to stare at people dressed like some kind of waiter putting up pretend \\"scary\\" peace signs...the extras who were cast in this film tried to follow some kind of direction, I think...but they ended up being unintentionally hillarious, rather than frightening    Bad camera angles-  Often the camera would just sit straight on and film bland shots of people sitting looking at something....nothing interesting going on, and no seemingly creative reason WHY the camera is doing that...I am not sure what the director was doing... it wasnt suspsnseful, it was just irritating    I could continue but I wont.    It's pretty sad to think that this film was set up by Richard Kelley, a director who is obviously much more skilled than this film would imply.     I think he was trying to go for some sort of \\"sense of dread\\" along the lines of M Night Shyamalan's \\"6th Sense\\", or \\"Signs\\".    Instead, \\"The Box\\" is even worse than Shyamalan's \\"The Happening\\"... This film is one of the worst \\"sci-fi\\" films to have been created by a Hollywood studio in the last 10 years
0156034026|5.0|This is an outstanding, creatively imagined story which manages to give many of us non-Islamic folks a glimpse into what being Islamic in the U.S. must have been like after 9/11.    The story takes place in Pakistan (Lahore) as Changez, once a successful immigrant in the U.S., relates his story to an unnamed American. From a privileged, but poor family, Changez manages to get into Princeton and graduate with honors. He lands a highly sought after and highly paid position with a New York \\"valuation\\" firm which tells companies what they are worth. He loves New York, falls in love with an American woman, and has more money than he ever anticipated.    But after Sept. 11Changez not only finds himself being viewed differently, but begins to view himself differently as well. He suddenly decides to grow a beard which draws even more attention to himself and begins to question his role in the U.S. In the meantime, his relationship with the woman he loves changes for reasons not related to Sept. 11, but also makes him question some essential questions.    While the unnamed and unheard American in the cafe could be a mere foil, Hamid manages to create an interesting character we know only through the eyes of Changez. The American's own visit to Pakistan is questionable and Changez works hard to assure the man of his safety. By the end of the novel you are surprised to find yourself in a page-turning, suspense-filled plot (and I'm not giving away any endings).    Hamid's narrative is tight and well controlled. At times I questioned the strange romantic relationship, but at the end of the novel we see that it serves to show us another side of the U.S. and Changez's relationship to it. It also teaches about Changez as a person, although we can see how he may appear distant to others. His work at the \\"valuation\\" firm is a high stakes position in which his answers determine the fate of others. When this begins to bother him he is encouraged to separate himself from the results since anyone could produce them -- it is nothing personal and he does not make the decisions. But Changez recognizes his role in the process.    It is this role which we build out upon as Changez begins to see the role he plays in other areas of his life. What he recognizes is that passivity is not an option. To use the existentialist formula, \\"not to choose is to choose.\\"  In other words, he moves from passivity to action which seems to surprise many, including himself. But is he really changing or simply becoming for himself? That is up to the reader to decide.    Regardless of the answer, Hamid's book is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand more of what is happening in the world today. There are no simple answers, but there is insight.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I purchased this CD not knowing if I would like anything on it other than the first song which is \\"I need you now\\". I thought it might be a little too country and I am not a country music fan, but I loved the entire CD. Five Stars!!!!!
B002RI9ORI|4.0|This is a very nice book in which the author shows us how easily we can be tricked these days. He opens our minds to not trust everything we are said on TV, news or any other midia. This is important, chiefly due to the pletora of bad emails we receive in the era of the Internet.<br />Although the author seems to be well intended all the time, one must judge some of this thoughts. But, most important, the book teaches us to be careful at the information we get and how we should check all the astonishing data we get that affects us.<br />To be honest, I don't agree with all opinions the author wrote in the book, but it's definitely a very good option to let us know how science is (or may I write \\"should be\\") carried out and how we can protect ourselves from all the social engineering that companies' (and governments') marketing areas target us daily through advertisements.<br />It's really worth reading and after you start reading it, you can hardly stop before finishing the whole book.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Classic Knopfler--understated, artistic and well produced.  Lush vocals and smooth guitar work.  What a treat to be able to understand the lyrics the first listen!  Great music.
0307269752|3.0|Summary of flaws:<br /><br />* First half is painfully slow, saturated with lots of unnecessary details. Book could have easily been cut down to 3/4 its length.<br /><br />* Too much exposition, not enough action. Good writers reveal information through actions and events that actually advance the story. Larsson, however, just lays it all out there and we have to plod through it like a textbook.<br /><br />* Author uses lots of \\"no one would ever do that in real life\\" moments to shoehorn characters into his desired plot situations.<br /><br />* Lisbeth's romantic relationship with Mikael is very contrived. It's as if Larsson is trying to make Mikael something of a 007. Book would have been better without it.<br /><br />* The secondary plot involving the Millenium Magazine taking on corrupt corporations is boring and doesn't really relate to the main murder mystery. Very disjointed.

I always though avoided Atkins because it was too strick...all you eat is meat and cheese...and just plain unhealthy. WRONG! I am so glad I hit a wall and decided to try Atkins! I eat so healthy now and feel so wonderful.<br />I am also a woman who had PCOS - couldn't concive on my own (2 babies on Fertility Drugs) and after 3 months of Atkins and loosing 40 lbs my husband and I decided it was time to have another - I told him I will give it 6 months and I didn't want to do any drugs (they make you feel like crap!) I was pregnant the first month! Crazy!! I maintained phase 3 of eating during my pregnancy (lots of veggies, some protein, and some grains) and had a very healthy baby girl.<br />I lost the 40 lbs I gained during my pregnancy within 6 months of the delivery (with no working out). AND I have lost another 20 lbs since (she's not a year old yet!) I love this way of life. It's not a diet... this is how I live and its not hard at all... I like the way I feel and want to keep feeling great!<br />If you have been wondering if you should try... do it for a week and see what happens (if you truely follow the plan YOU WILL SEE RESULTS) Aren't you worth it?? Good luck to all out there!
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|All these songs flow really well and is one of the best solo albums I ever heard.  There's alot of big names on this record and there isn't a dud on this record.  Starlight is perhaps my favorite track on the record Myles and Slash really mix well but is there anybody that Myles doesn't?  After hearing the Myles tracks I am confident that the new Alter Bridge record will be nothing short of amazing (as usual).  I've been following this album for quite awhile and am really glad its finally out and on the shelves the wait was definitely worth it and I hope by working with so many artists that Slash has found a new voice for Velvet Revolver.  He really doesn't have to go back to VR honestly I think he can pull off the solo artist really well and I am kind of hoping he stays solo.  I will definitely see Slash when he comes around just to see how these songs are preformed live with Myles.  The production on the album is really great to I'm not sure who produced it but it sounds really well so I give a nod to the producer for producing a great album.  I am also glad he ditched the name Slash & Friends Slash has a more epic feel.  Now that this record is out I will patiently await Slash II.  This is one of the great first releases of 2010 for looks like to be a mediocre year for music but we will see it is on April after all pick it up while its hot if your a Slash, GN'R VR fan you will love this album.

031606792X|2.0|First, let me say the first two sections... Bella and Jacob could have been condensed into about 10 meaningful pages.  What a complete waste!  They drug on and they were just horribly painful to even get through.  The last Bella section of the book I loved.  Finally, Bella decides to be a strong woman in the end.  It's about time!  I found myself not wanting to put the book down through the last section, but during the first two sections was struggling to not throw it in the trash.
B0033G9OFA|5.0|Doors fan missing the point. It's not a greatest hits package it's a soundtrack to the film. BIG difference. Almost everything on the disc has not been released, so why is this the same? Johnny Depp reading poetry...NEW. LMF from Sullivan(heard yes)but never released on a CD...NEW. This is a great film and the soundtrack is a score!!! Don't miss it.
0545123267|1.0|I can't stand not finishing a book once I start reading.  However, after 200 pages in, I just realized this book is far too painful to even pick up anymore.

B00000K0E5|2.0|Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of the Pierce Brosnan 007 movies. However, this was the worst 007 movie of his I've ever seen! The acting is not very good. The main villian, played by Famke Janssen, isn't a good villian. Although beautiful, she really doesn't do a good job of acting. The movie is also cut poorly. I lost the point of the story after the first hour! The effects and chase scenes are great though.     In conclusion,I'd only advise watching it if it's on TV. It's not worth buying.

B002NXSRVG|2.0|I revised my review, now that my brain is functional again.    Having spent much of my childhood in the 80's to mid-90's, there were a number of cartoon shows that had me entranced on Friday nights and Saturday mornings. Thundercats, Silverhawks, the Super Mario Bros Super Show (with Legend of Zelda), and of course, G.I.Joe. It was a great time to be a kid to say the least!     Fast forward almost twenty years; looking back at them, I'll admit that they weren't exactly cinematic masterpieces. The animation wasn't the greatest (sometimes bordering on mediocre), the story-lines were simple, and some of the dialogue was extremely cheesy. But the characters (heroes and villains) were memorable, each with their own theme/schtick, personality, and abilities. Each show had the basic formula: start off with a catchy theme song, throw your characters into a situation with a surprise or two, add in the action and let the good guys triumph!     Now, how do you make something like that into a 2009 summer action flick? From the track record of previous cartoons made into movies, I know I wouldn't! But Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Stephen Sommers had to try anyway because it seemed like the thing to do at the time (Transformers was fresh on everyone's minds, for all the wrong reasons). Does this movie have the formula of its cartoon ancestor? Well... no, not really.    Our heroes start off in Egypt, where the villainous Cobra decides to unleash its evil plan, which involves stealing WMDs made up of nanomachines which can eat through anything. Duke and Ripcord (Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans respectively) find themselves in a jam, and end up being rescued by Scarlett (Rachel Nichols) and Snake Eyes (Ray Park). Unsuccessful, Baroness (Sienna Miller) and Storm Shadow (Byung Hun-Lee) are sent to the Pit (which should not be in Egypt BTW) to make the attempt again. Successful after yet another fight scene, they take the warheads to Baron DeCobray in Paris. Somehow in the midst of theJoes crashing through trains and leaping across buildings in their augmentation suits (I don't remember that from the cartoon), Cobra manages to fire one of the WMDs, destroying the Eiffel Tower and a couple dozen vehicles with it.    I'll admit, this part made me laugh out loud, because it reminds me so much of another movie which spoofed G.I.Joe (America, ---- yeah!). But a lot of the other aspects of the movie just leaves my head shaking in dismay. Maybe it's the nostalgia in me that cries out when these mistakes rear their ugly heads. Just to name my five biggest beefs:    1. Baroness was Duke's ex-girlfriend? That's a big negative. She was clearly German in both the cartoon series and the comics, and she had a thing for Destro. Plus, she pretty much liked being evil (which... most of us liked as well; she was evil hot!).    2. G.I.Joe is an international anti-terrorism team? Holy mother of... <whew> alright. G.I.Joe was a counterterrorism team, but they were Americans. Okay, Hollywood, just exactly what's wrong with being American?    3. The origin of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow: Seeing how this was a huge part of this movie (flashbacks and all), you'd think they'd at least have this straightened out. Snake Eyes was NOT Japanese. Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow were not bitter rivals (in fact, Storm Shadow defects from Cobra in the comics).     4. Where was everyone else? You know: Flint, Gung-Ho, Lady Jaye, Sgt Slaughter, Roadblock, etc.? Granted, the screenplay writers did pick a few of the characters that fans were familiar with (and invented one to give Marlon Wayans a role), which matters little due to the fact that their respective backgrounds and specialities were wrong.     5. Total lack of realism: In action movies, I'm fairly good at suspending my disbelief. But in this movie, there's way too much to chew! Ripcord chasing a missile with a jet fighter (with no G-suit, or helmet w/supplemental oxygen), ice that sinks like anvils (I wish I was making this up), and powered suits that allow our heroes to leap across buildings and through trains in a single bound. Sounds like the X-Men, not G.I.Joe.    In spite of my gripes, I'll grant that at least some effort was input to make this movie. The plot at least made sense (more than I can say for Transformers 2), and a few of the action scenes were entertaining (Snake Eyes versus Storm Shadow). It does qualify as an action movie, not a good one, but watchable. But I will sum it up with this: there are far better action movies out there. If you absolutely have to watch this, rent it. If you're a G.I.Joe fan, it's only going to make you mad. Buy the classic comic books instead; you'll be glad you did.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|I'm a HUGE HUGE fan of Star Trek the Next Generation, Star Trek Deep Space Nine, and Star Trek Voyager.  I got this complete set thinking I will save some money, but I prefer buying the separate seasons rather than purchasing the complete series from Star Trek the Next Generation (or Deep Space Nine & Voyager):<br /><br />You get three book-like containers that securely hold the DVDs.  Maybe not first-class material, but decent plastic.  I didn't see any problem with the packaging.  All arrived in excellent condition and the DVDs ran fine.  Favorite Next Generation characters were printed on the back of the DVDs to honor the 20th Anniversary Issue--I thought this was indeed a nice surprise.<br /><br />I have a problem with the quality of the DVDs, which are indeed slightly lesser quality than the \\"Silver\\" separate seasons--shame on you Paramount!!!  I was not aware of this when I purchased the set.  (Read the other reviews stating these DVDs are not HD--I don't have HD equipment--just regular TVs and Magnavox DVD players.)  I don't think it is noticeable to everybody, but the original separate seasons are slightly sharper even without HD equipment.  Characters and objects up front are sharp, but sharpness diminishes slightly with distance.  I am finicky and fussy sometimes to the extreme--especially when it comes to my favorite Star Trek series.  If you want to save some money and are not finicky to the extreme like me, this set should be just fine, otherwise, think about buying the entire set separately.
0385504225|2.0|Cmon Dan, you can do better than this -- you HAVE done better than this.  I might be generous with the 2 stars rating, but this book put me to sleep repeatedly when I am usually on the edge of my seat (or edge of my bed, up all night) reading.      The Langdon character is contradictory and confusing in this one.  He's been around the block one too many times and it shows; it's too late to try to add more to the character, we know who he is now and how he would react to new situations.      Yawn-fest.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|I loved this movie way more than I was expecting to (hey, it's Robert Downey, Jr.! what's not to love?) but I'm a bit disappointed with this DVD - whither the extras? No commentaries at all and only one blah blah blah behind-the-scenes documentary that's all of 20 minutes long (or something). Good thing I bought it off Amazon and didn't pay full price! &lt;--say that last bit a little louder
B000002LPD|5.0|(Yes, we all know what the initials stand for... get over it)<br /><br />For those who complained about [[ASIN:B000002L9A 5150]] and [[ASIN:B000002LEM OU812]], you can be quiet now - this album /rocks/. Those albums had their good moments, but overall they didn't really impress the hard-core Van Halen fans. This is what you're used to hearing from Van Halen, no matter who the singer is. Blazing guitar licks, searing vocals, bass and drums (real ones, not synth) working together... this is what you want.<br /><br />The song everyone knows from this album is \\"Right Now\\" - it's gotten plenty of airplay over the years, it's been featured in ads for everything from sodas to cars, and it's even been played at the Olympics. It's a good song, no doubt about it - but I wouldn't call it the best on the album. \\"Runaround\\" and \\"Top of the World\\" also got a lot of airplay, and they're also good songs.<br /><br />\\"Judgment Day\\" - definitely the hardest, loudest song on the album... this one will blow your speakers out in true Van Halen fashion. So will \\"The Dream is Over\\", \\"Pleasure Dome\\" and \\"Poundcake\\"... a lot of great Eddie Van Halen guitar riffs in those songs.<br /><br />\\"316\\", \\"Man On a Mission\\" and \\"Spanked\\" are fairly mediocre, but the rest of the album stands on its own, easily.<br /><br />If you've held off getting a Van Halen album featuring Sammy Hagar because you didn't know what it was going to be like, you can relax... long enough to throw this one in and crank it to the max. One of their best albums in years.

B0018QCXH8|5.0|There are many things one could say to praise this magnificent film. That Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible in his role. That the film looks amazing. That it has an original, interesting story... the list could go on. Many critics have named this film one of the best--if not the best--of the first decade of this century. I certainly agree. Just buy this film. It gets richer every time one sees it and looks spectacular on Blu-ray.
B002GZQY6Q|3.0|I first became interested in Porcupine Tree several years ago after hearing the song \\"Trains\\" from their album In Absentia on internet radio. Since then I've bought a total of four of the band's recordings, this being the fourth.  This album is very much in keeping with other of the band's output in that even the casual listener could probably identify it as having come from the same place as the others. Having said that, I must say that in my opinion this album is not quite up to the level of, say, Deadwing or In Absentia as far as listening enjoyment is concerned. It just doesn't seem to hold my interest so well.  This is not a bad album, it has it's moments.  Overall though,it's just maybe one rung down on the ladder.
B001W79MB8|4.0|Well I think the story could have been adapted better.Character development could be better.The animation could nave been better.They could made it a bit darker or a more artistic approach.<br /><br />The fight sequence is not bad but my favorite part of this movie is the voice acting of the actors, even though the Chinese parts sounded a bit strange to me.<br />I love how Nagase delivered his lines.He sounded so natural and believable.Sometimes I would let the movie on and just listen .Sounded as if he is really acting out his lines , I could tell he is not a  seiyuu, it is very refreshing.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I've read the other reviewers' comments, pro & con, and am aware of the obvious comparisons of the other major works by the same production team. Comparison is tempting but the Pacific and Atlantic Theaters of war were so different in their basic strategies as to, in my opinion, defy comparison. In Europe, the Allies invaded at Normandy after securing north Africa and the Mediterranean. This made a two front war for a \\"stand alone\\" Germany a reality. The strategy for the Allies was to gain control of occupied geography and liberate populations. The strategy differed in the Pacific because the geography was sparsely populated by comparison and much more vast in scale. Control of airspace and the sea was viewed by both sides as essential to victory. This dictated the nature of strategies including the deployment of resources, i.e men and materials in a way devised to cut off enemy resources and destroy supply lines. \\"Island Hopping\\" gave the Allies that desired result without having to sustain the casualties which would have occurred with the liberation and occupation of thousands of islands. BofB reflects the nature of a huge array of armed might focused on defined geographic goals as it relates to a single unit involved in the effort from invasion to VE Day. TPac, dictated by the nature of the war was less cohesive with much smaller numbers (per action) involved in smaller geography and, by necessity, demanded a more complex mobility than was the reality in Europe. There was also a good deal of interservice rivalry that was less than \\"good natured\\"...witness the truck scene when the Army driver does not even make the attempt at avoiding the Marines on Gualdalcanal. My father, an officer in the US Navy from the outset of the war, referenced a comment he said was oft repeated in the Pacific...\\"the Navy shells it and softens it up, the Marines land and fight to take it, the Army shows up to occupy it.\\"    I find the series to be a very believable representation of whatI've read and learned growing up from the conversations of those who were there. Kudos to the producers whose efforts have, thus far, shown the differences between the theaters and the impact on the men who fought in them.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|I only paid $1.00 to rent this piece of work, and that was a waste of my money.  If you saw the trailers, you saw everything that was worth watching.  The acting was wooden, the plot was ridiculous.  The special effects, yes, were indeed spectacular.  The entire movie could EASILY have been condensed down to an hour and a half, which would have been tolerable.  My advice, rent before you buy.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Every time I watch and listen to this DVD  it moves me to tears from time to time, and laughing in between.    The Musicians who play and sing with Leonard Cohen are nothing less than perfect!  Talk about a perfect match? - THIS is it! - They are all incredible artists in their own right!    Some of the words to a few of the songs are a little confusing for this Cohen newbie, but that doesn't prevent me from thoroughly enjoying this group of well seasoned artists, and their most perfect performances. - Make time to watch, and listen to this uninterrupted, as it is almost hypnotic, and compels one to stay put until the end.    The rendition of \\"Hallelujah\\" is well done by many artists, but to hear it from the man who wrote it,   play,and sing it, is truly music to the ears, and emotion to the eyes and mind!

B000YAA68C|4.0|I must admit I had fairly low expectations for this film, as I was not a big fan of [[ASIN:B000NOK1KM Freedom Writers (Full Screen Edition)]], the work of the previous partnership between Hillary Swank and director Richard LaGravenese.  I was also mixed about Gerard Butler as a romantic lead...thought he was borderline cartoonish in the Katherine Heigl vehicle [[ASIN:B002P413IC The Ugly Truth (Widescreen Edition)]] but very effective as 'The Stranger' in the underrated [[ASIN:B00094AS9A Dear Frankie]].<br /><br />With that backdrop, I was very pleasantly surprised by this film.  I underestimated the impact of the Hillary Swank Likability Quotient.  [Her inherent likability being one of the big factors in her two Oscar wins.]  The opening scene of the movie is a revelation - a very well done 10-minute or so extended dialogue between Swank and Butler that presents the current state of their relationship about 11 years in.  The movie then goes forwards and backwards in time from there.  The quality of the acting is set in that first scene though - Hillary Swank's uncommon attractiveness and standout acting together with Gerard Butler's charm and ease of manner make for real chemistry.  As compared to, say, the fairly dreadful [[ASIN:B0021L8UZS Did You Hear About the Morgans?]] where I wouldn't have imagined Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant's characters together in a thousand years, you could fully envisage these two as a couple.  LaGravenese only strengthens that by providing you the back story of their relationship as the movie progresses.  When you finally get back to when the two characters first meet, you can see how and why Butler was immediately smitten.<br /><br />One casting note: Gerard Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan - a Scot and Yank respectively - are the two leading Irishmen.  Seriously?  They're both good, but not a single Irishman could be rounded up for either of these roles?<br /><br />The DVD Extras were a bit disappointing - no \\"making of\\" vignette (a little odd - usually a sign of people disassociating themselves from a film of questionable quality, which can't be the case here).  But kudos for a neat little (and kitschy) primer on \\"The Name of the Game is Snaps.\\"<br /><br />I also have to make a snarky comment about the summary of the movie on the DVD sleeve found inside my red envelope (hint, hint).  The first line of the summary states that Swank's character is Dublin-based.  Huh? Do these synopsis-izers even watch these movies?ally a sign of people disassociating themselves from a film of questionable quality, which can't be the case here).

1594488843|5.0|Some concepts in this book explained/clarified some important things for me about behavior and incentives. Incentives do drive behavior but a lot of those, it turns out, are in our very nature.     The best compliment I can give to a book is that it added to my list of things to remember. There were a number of additions I made based on this book. Maybe more importantly, they all make me feel better about the best things that I have done and what I can expect to come in the future.
074356619X|1.0|Okay, I was heading up north for a long drive and wanted something to listen to, so I stopped by my local Barnes and Nobles and bought this, eager to finally learn what \\"The Secret\\" was. What the secret is (spoiler alert) is a series of stories about people that have had things happen to them in life (good and bad) and then trace backwards and attribute what happened to the energy emmited by their state of mind prior to the event. If I am watching a baseball game and drinking beer, pretty soon I have to run to the bathroom in between innings to pee. Now, I know that my needing to pee is a direct results of the beer I am drinking, an obvious cause and effect. Now, if I get an unexpected $10,000 check in the mail today, I could think back and say \\"wow, I was thinking that I was going to get some money and here it is!\\" However, if I still am thinking great thoughts about getting money in my life and today I do not get a $10,000 check in the mail (but maybe an unexpected $10,000 bill to pay) then my positive thinking has failed. Or maybe, my positive thinking and negative thinking has had nothing to do with it? Okay, I don't want to bash the idea of positive thinking as it is always good to be open to the opportunities that life presents; however, for this book to suggest a direct cause and effect link between thinking positively and discrete events like getting a big check in the mail is, at best, flawed logic. Save your money and buy practical self-help books or a copy of the Dhammapada if you want to learn about the power of your thoughts.

B0007PAMR4|2.0|I like Dune, but this David Lynch version of Dune (Extended Edition) is somewhat old and odd. It's probably too foreign and freaky for most audiences. It's not always faithful to the book, in the worst possible ways. In one infamous scene, Baron Harkonnen kills a boy-servant by pulling his heart plug. What does that add to the movie?     I recommend Frank Herbert's Dune (Sci-Fi TV Miniseries) (Special Edition Director's Cut) (3-Disc DVD Set) over this version. The computer-generated special effects aren't great, but everything else is an improvement.
B002QXI2M2|5.0|Stage action in many of these early operas is minimal so combining the singing with action in the form of ballet adds to the visual appeal IF that ballet is appropriate to the libretto and singing. Very fortunately the interpretive dance choreographed by Pina Bausch is just that. She first experimented with it in 1975 and this production is a revival of that. The mezzo soprano Maria Riccarda Wesseling has a gorgious voice ideally suited to the role of Orpheus and her role is shadowed by the dancer Yann Bridard.<br /><br />On first acquaintance this dance-opera interpretation can seem odd and I found it required more than a single viewing to decide if it was personally appealing - and untimately yes it was. The music is beautifully played and sung under the direction of Thomas Hengelbrock which combined with very effective costuming and lighting comes across superbly in the Blu Ray format. The audio quality is appropriately first class.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B000T0XED6|5.0|This is the third CD in a new series of recordings that Maurizio Pollini has devoted lately to Beethoven sonatas.  The great Italian virtuoso tackles here three early works, namely those assigned to op.2 in Titan's catalogue. Beethoven dedicated his very first piano sonatas to the undisputed father of the Viennese Classicism - Joseph Haydn - and that can be somehow sensed in their witty atmosphere, the playful phrases and the sparkling outbursts resembling their dedicatee's own manner of composing. Yet, the deep feelings and dramatic moods are not absent at all. But they are acting here - so to speak - \\"under cover\\", under the strict control of a well-balanced reason. Rather suggesting than affirming. Certain massive melodic structures and even virtuosic passageworks point towards that inexorable force Beethoven finally displayed in his output and (though, still discretely) announce the Beethovenian grandeur to come. Pollini captures the graceful aroma of these early sonatas and lend them his own nervousness, his own taste for strong contrasts, for sharp light-dark edges. There is no room for floating Mozartean style or poised Haydnian lively jokes in Pollini's approach. The full Beethovenian struggle of contrasts, drama and Romantic passion take the stage from the first bars.  The liner notes supplied by Paolo Petazzi (as in the previous two CDs in the series) are welcome, adequate and efficient for the reader who needs the stylistic context, the structures and technical details of the partitions to be explained.  All in all, this is a remarkable achievement from Pollini who is supposed to continue the recording series of his Beethoven sonatas up to the complete cycle. That would be for sure his definitive rendition, entirely realized in the XXI century when both his conceptual force and technical skills have reached authoritative exquisiteness. If so, it would be very captivating then to compare his actual \\"mellow\\" approach with the \\"wild\\" one of his youth when herecorded, for instance, the last trilogy (opp. 109, 110 and 111). Impatiently waiting for that occasion!
0385523904|5.0|This is the best book I've read so far this year.  The author tells a completely fascinating story of life in North Korea.  Most of us hear about the North Korean nuclear threat on the radio all the time, but I suspect most people are like me and know very little about the country.<br /><br />The author describes North Korea from the perspective of several North Korean defectors.  Obviously, defectors are going to be biased against the country, so I do wonder if the portrait of the country is overly negative as a result.  However, even if it is, it's still a fascinating story.  The story starts after the Korean war and continues until the present day.<br /><br />Reading about the lives of these ordinary people will definitely change the way I think about North Korea when I hear about it in the news.<br /><br />The book is extremely well written and engrossing.  It's not a dry history book at all.
B0006ZFQP8|5.0|Richard Wagner is my all-time favorite opera composer. It's true that he was a heartless human being who despised Jews and betrayed many of his close friends. But you simply cannot deny the fact that he has created some truly amazing music. And it's that kind of music that I can't help but love. Der Fliegende Hollander, Tannhauser, and of course, Der Ring des Nibelugen (my personal favorite) are timeless works that showcase Wagner's ingenious musical abilities. You might have heard snippets from all of them, perhaps in the famous Bugs Bunny short or in the helicopter scene from Apocalypse Now. To me, small fragments of these operas just aren't enough to show you the epic ranges of these \\"musical dramas.\\" You would have to listen to all of them from beginning to end in order to fully appreciate Wagner's undeniable musical genius. To tell you the truth, though, I have not yet listened to Lohengrin, Parsifal, or Die Meistersinger von Nuremberg as of now. I hope I will whenever I find the perfect time. But right now, let's talk about Tristan und Isolde.<br /><br />While he was creating his Ring Cycle, Wagner also focused on one of his side projects, which would be an adaptation of Gottfried von Strassburg's re-telling of the legend of Tristan and Isolde. The story centers mostly on Isolde, whose own betrothed has been killed by Tristan during a major battle. Discovering Tristan's identity, the young Irish princess desires vengeance. But as soon as she confronts him, their eyes meet for the first time. This eventually leads to a growing admiration between the two, and what happens next becomes the first act of the opera. Against all odds, Tristan has won Isolde as a bride for his king in order to keep his stellar image held against his enemies. Angered by his betrayal, Isolde, with the assistance of her maid Brangane, pours a potion in Tristan's chalice. It is believed that the potion will take the man's life away, but in actuality, Brangane has instead put in a love potion. This tonic doesn't bring both Tristan and Isolde closer together, but rather brings them to the fact that in the future, they will somehow die together due to the \\"adulterous\\" love they now share. Both acknowledge this as their fate while they are on their way to meet King Marke, the future husband of Isolde. And this is all only the first act.....<br /><br />Tristan und Isolde is a musically complex opera. As a matter of fact, this opera became the most influential in its time most notably for its departure of traditional tonality and for its use of a wide range of harmonic structure. Wagner also broadened the use of the chromatic scale; the music is heavily chromatic, which was unusual at the time. The famous Tristan chord is one clear example. Being the first notes in the beginning of the Act I Prelude, it shows the progression towards a new musical age (the beginning of atonality). The vocal parts are complex as well. Nowhere else have I heard such sophisticated notes and demanding voices (except maybe Krzysztof Penderecki's choral works). You would have to be an incredibly certified professional to master the text and the music.<br /><br />Now to be completely honest, this is the first time that I have ever heard Tristan und Isolde. I just recently purchased this particular 1980's recording, and I listened to it straight through last night. I was completely satisfied by not only the music, but the conductor, the orchestra, and the singers. First, the late Carlos Kleiber has done a marvelous job with the score. His conducting reminded me of maestro Marek Janowski and his handling of the Ring Cycle: the focus is mainly on the score and the technicalities that come with it, and not on the actual drama that lies in the music. But unlike Janowski (who is my favorite conductor for the Ring), Kleiber adds his own extraordinary flair. There is a certain energy surrounding the most exciting moments, while a mystical touch is added in the softer sections. The tempois quick when it's required to be (nothing is rushed), and it's slow when it has to be (nothing is lethargic). It is an overall intelligent reading with plenty of energy and mysticism. You can tell that Kleiber has done his homework. The Staatskapelle Dresden has impressed me with their Ring Cycle, and they impress me yet again. The orchestral sound is lush, colorful, and atmospheric. Special mention goes to the English horn solo in Act III Scene One. And of course, we can't forget about the singers. Rene Kollo as Tristan is a real treat: he's got the strength and the passion down almost perfectly. Margaret Price is a famous Mozartian soprano, and this is her first performance as Isolde. Some might be skeptical about this, but the way she gains control of the role is almost surprising: her voice has the intelligence and the sensation. She sounds more of a real princess instead of a Valkyrie, and I think it fits. It's not too heavy, not too rugged. Just the way I like it. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's usual smooth baritone voice is appropriate for the role of Kurwenal, while Brigitte Fassbaender gives a very flawless performance as Brangane. Kurt Moll, Werner Gotz, Eberhard Buchner, Anton Dermota, and Wolfgang Hellmich are equally great and thus complete the cast.<br /><br />There should be a lack of doubt when Tristan und Isolde is described as one of Wagner's greatest. It's musically complex with some rich orchestrations and astonishing singing. I don't think it'll replace Wagner's own Ring Cycle as my #1 favorite opera, but I'm pretty sure it'll remain high on my list. If you love Wagner's music, then you will definitely love this. And if you own the Karajan and Bohm recordings (which I don't), then I see nothing wrong in adding the Kleiber recording on your shelf.<br /><br />Grade: Ared to be (nothing is rushed), and it's slow when it has to be (nothing is lethargic).

1439190275|4.0|My husband and I have tried the Atkins diet in the past and know without a doubt that it works. That's the positive. The negative was that you were limited to what you could eat, and you had to eat that way for the rest of your life, because if you don't stick to it faithfully, you would regain the weight, which we did.<br /><br />This is the \\"new and improved\\" Atkins diet. It looks almost the same, but you are allowed a variety of foods even in the Induction stage. This looks like a plan you could easily follow for life.<br /><br />There are four parts to the book:<br />Part 1~ Why It Works: It's All About Nutrition<br />Part 2~ What To Eat: How To Tailor Atkins To Your Needs & Goals<br />Part 3~ Eating Out, Eating In: Atkins In The Real World<br />Part 4~ A Diet For Life: The Science Of Good Health<br /><br />There are four phases to the diet:<br />Phase 1~ Induction<br />Phase 2~ Ongoing Weight Loss (OWL)<br />Phase 3~ Pre-Maintenence<br />Phase 4~ Lifetime Maintenance<br /><br />The authors use real people and their stories to help you understand how the New Atkins has helped them. There is information on low carb fast food and restaurant meals, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular health, managing diabetes, and recipes & meal plans.<br /><br />To be honest I haven't tried this new approach to Atkins, but it does look easy to follow and also to stay on. I love that the induction isn't as strict. My husband has been talking about going back on the Atkins diet and if and when we do, we'll use this book as our guide.<br /><br />*Thanks to Anna and Planned Television Arts for this review copy*

B00024BHTC|4.0|Once being Nightwish's 5th studio album and 2004 is more great symphonic power metal with the amazing vocals of Tarja Turunen. The album was a massive hit and peaked the charts in Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Norway. Allmusic gave the album 3.5/5 which I think is to low. The booklet contains all the lyrics and has some very neat photographs of the members of the band. This is the last album with Tarunen and next album they changed vocalist to Anette Olzon. 4/5.
B0036CWK8O|5.0|I was truly skeptical when I first heard of this album several months ago. I was expecting a been-there-done-that metal-band-in-front-of-an-orchestra kind of release. But being a long time Helloween fan (since the mid-80s), owning every album they have ever released, having seen them live twice, I wasn't going to dismiss it. And man, does Helloween deliver!    I have read a number of negative reviews on various metal sites, some saying Helloween has sunk to a new low. I couldn't disagree more. This album is amazing! The level of creativity, love and care that has gone into the work of rearranging these songs is truly astounding. The mix of pop, jazz, classical and whatever other genres have been included enriches these songs to a whole new level.    I love the saxes on Dr. Stein, the acoustic guitars on Future World, The guitar and piano work on If I Could Fly, the choirs (even the children's choir), the orchestra, the beat, the rhythms, the female vocals on Eagle Fly Free.... There are so many details woven into every song, for the first time in ages I find myself just sitting and listening to the music, discovering new details on every listen.    Helloween is a band that is not afraid of experimentation, of taking chances. They proved that on Chameleon, Metal Jukebox, and on the panned-by-many but what I consider their best album, The Dark Ride. And they prove it again with Unarmed. Compare that to Gamma Ray, created by Kai Hansen when he left Helloween way back when. I love Gamma Ray too, but there are no surprises there, you always know what you get.     Here's to Helloween! I hope you never stop surprising me!
B002VPE1B6|3.0|What I have determined from seeing AVATAR is that the only reason for seeing it is the effects. James Cameron has always been a groundbreaker when it comes to pushing the envelope of special effects use in Hollywood. His effects company, Digital Domain, pioneered the \\"morphing\\" technology initially in THE ABYSS, but really put it to work with TERMINATOR 2. He is a technical filmmaker beyond compare. And, before TITANIC, which is another film that is technically amazing to watch, he was a consumate storyteller as well. But with TITANIC, suddenly we were thrust into a world of stock characters that were so cliched, they bordered on insulting, and dialogue so stilted that it seemed to be lifted from other films.<br /><br />And this is the same case with AVATAR. While beatuiful to look at, the emotional attachment that is so vital in telling any story is, for lack of a better term, absent. I didn't care about any single character in this entire film enough to want to see them succeed or fail. Sam Worthington unfortunately suffers again, as he did in TERMINATOR: SALVATION, from his total lack of emotional connectivity. He seems to have no real core, but he's a character we are instantly designed to care about because he's been crippled in a... actually, how did that happen? Sigourney Weaver is a tough-love scientist and we're supposed to like her because she's tough, but she really cares about people beneath that tough exterior. Giovanni Ribisi is essentially Paul Reiser's character from ALIENS. He only sees profits. We're supposed to hate him. Okay, I get it. Stephen Lang is the gruff and morally bankrupt single-minded military man who cares only about the mission. Ok, so he's Michael Biehn from THE ABYSS. Zoe Saldana (or her Na'vi-ness) is tough, resourceful, and independent, and teaches the intruder about her culture and helps the intruder learn their language. So, she's Mary McDonnell from DANCES WITH WOLVES.<br /><br />Starting to see the point here?<br /><br />Even the plot is recycled... now, before you go off on me and say that every story has already been told and that I don't know what I'm saying, well, to the first part of that, you'd be right. Every great story has already been told.<br /><br />But does it have to be such a direct rip-off of DANCES WITH WOLVES? A man of one world gets to have experiences with indigenous peoples of another \\"world\\" and through their culture, he grows beyond himself and becomes one with them... but then the people whose culture he originally belonged to want to take the land away from the indigenous peoples and he is branded a traitor, and he must fight the very people he once gave his allegiance to.<br /><br />And obviously, Cameron's heart is in the right place, making statements about the problems with private military contractors and taking control of a land and forcing the people out just to get at their natural resources. And therein lies the lynchpin of this film. He's trying to make statements, and not tell a powerful story.<br /><br />It just doesn't hold water anymore, James. You once made us care about a cyborg killing machine. Why can't you do that with living breathing people anymore? The best advice that I could give to Cameron is to pull a Spielberg and make a smaller film that is more personal to him and forgo the effects and all the bells and whistles and just make a small film with a compelling story.<br /><br />You may be the King of the World, box-office wise, but you've lost the faith of the people like me who used to love you because you opt for spectacle and not for emotion.<br /><br />And bravo to AMPAS for recognizing that a small film released in obscurity mid-summer has a more resounding effect on people than one released in time for the holidays that cost $300 million to make. And they recognized that film accordingly, because truly, THE HURT LOCKER was one of the, if not THE best film of 2009.. now, before you go off on me and say that every story has already been told and that I don't know what I'm saying, well, to the first part of that, you'd be right. Every great story has already been told.     But does it have to be such a direct rip-off of DANCES WITH WOLVES? A man of one world gets to have experiences with indigenous peoples of another \\"world\\" and through their culture, he grows beyond himself and becomes one with them... but then the people whose culture he originally belonged to want to take the land away from the indigenous peoples and he is branded a traitor, and he must fight the very people he once gave his allegiance to.     And obviously, Cameron's heart is in the right place, making statements about the problems with private military contractors and taking control of a land and forcing the people out just to get at their natural resources. And therein lies the lynchpin of this film. He's trying to make statements, and not tell a powerful story.    It just doesn't hold water anymore, James. You once made us care about a cyborg killing machine. Why can't you do that with living breathing people anymore? The best advice that I could give to Cameron is to pull a Spielberg and make a smaller film that is more personal to him and forgo the effects and all the bells and whistles and just make a small film with a compelling story.     You may be the King of the World, box-office wise, but you've lost the faith of the people like me who used to love you because you opt for spectacle and not for emotion.     And bravo to AMPAS for recognizing that a small film released in obscurity mid-summer has a more resounding effect on people than one released in time for the holidays that cost $300 million to make. And they recognized that film accordingly, because truly, THE HURT LOCKER was one of the, if not THE best film of 2009.
0385504225|5.0|Not finished it yet but Dan Brown writes a marvelous/interesting story. Love reading all his books.....waiting for the next one.
1439157383|5.0|I was reading the reviews and many were disappointed with the ending of the book.  I was actually disappointed in the ending of the movie.  When I finished the book I cried till my face got red, when the movie ended I didn't shed a tear.  The book had me way more intrested than the movie itself; if its a drama it should make you cry.  Loved the ending wished they would have kept it the same in the movie, I just can't get over that.
B001992NUQ|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies since I saw it in theaters my senior year of high-school. I won't bother reviewing the movie itself becasue at this point, that would be a waste of everyone's time. I have been avoiding buying movies on Blu-Ray that I already own on DVD (I have over 500 DVD's, so that's avoiding a lot of movies) simply because that would be a financial nightmare and totally unjustifiable in most cases. The playstation 3 Blu-Ray player upconverts regular DVD's to make them look pretty nice on the 1080p tv so I haven't really felt the need for a better picture on most of my movies. Another annoying factor is the special editions of many of my DVD's have way more bonus features than the new Blu-Rays have, which is lame. The 10th Anniversary edition of Fight Club on Blu-Ray is awesome. It totally negates the need to hang on to my old Special Edition DVD and it looks fantastic. For anyone who says they can't tell the difference between this and DVD they are either blind or don't have the right equipment to view at full potential. I am very pleased with this Blu-Ray edition and for [...] bucks here on Amazon, I can't complain about buying another version of the same movie. It is loaded with special features, and is truly a new experience in watching this great movie. Anyone questioning if it's worth the upgrade, I say yes!
B0031S4K5E|5.0|Fast shipping & received in excellent/new condition just as described. The plush toy is super cute and soft.
0446569895|5.0|This is a Great book for the Ozzy fans.  You can almost hear him reading it to you !
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I agree with the majority of other reviewers!  Discovery Channel.......PLEASE leave the BBC Nature Programs alone and stop trying to Hollywood-ize them.  The filming and cinematography is awesome, however, Oprah's narration is so borng that both my husband and I fell asleep halfway through the second hour of the program. I will be ordering the BBC version in Blu-Ray and inviting several relatives over to watch with us as they too were very disappointed and stopped watching it. Hope someone from the Discovery Channel picks up on all these reviews and takes a hint to leave.....not just \\"well enough\\" alone, but  \\"brilliant\\" programming alone!
B00328G4V6|1.0|The CD was a huge disappointment.  These are just jam-songs that sound like practice sessions of a bar band.  Nothing new here, just out takes that should have remained out takes.  The biggest let down is that there is hardly any virtuoso acid guitar playing from one of the greatest of all time.  I got fooled again.
0399247459|5.0|Classic book. Love it in the boardbook, but the CD with Eric Carle isn't that impressive. Still 5 stars!
0439023483|5.0|I read this book more or less in a day because I couldn't put it down.  I wasn't too sure if I'd enjoy a YA title, but I'm so glad I didn't let that label stop me.<br /><br />I won't give another description of the actual story, but I'll tell you how this book made me feel.<br /><br />Once I was done, I missed the characters, which says alot about the writer's skill in making me care.  Being a title for YA also shows this writer's talent.  I couldn't be more drawn into the action, pulled into the romance, concerned about the outcomes, moved to emotion all while making sure the tone was appropriate for the target audience.  This will be the first book that I pass along to my 12-year old, one that we'll equally enjoy, because I feel she's going to love it as much as I.<br /><br />I'm so glad that the second book is already out and I don't have to wait.
0399229191|5.0|This book is great. The size is wonderful too. Fits into a diaper bag easily. Great for the car!
B002S0OBN2|5.0|I have just purchased my second copy of this Deluxe version with the added DVD.  I bought the first for myself and now the second as a gift for a favorite grand-daughter....I would not have spent the money if I had not found it well worth while.  I have read a lot of the other reviews.  Yes I know, that this sequel is not in the same catagory as the first \\"Phantom\\", but I suspect that it is very difficult for any sequel to stand up to the first one it is following.  I liked the added DVD as much for the backstage aspects of how the show is being put together, as the black and white photos of early Coney Island and the people of that time and age...It goes to setting the stage for this new production.  Yes, I really would have loved to have Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford back in the roles that they made famous.  For whatever reason, that was not in the cards.  This edition is a bit darker and there does not seem to be the same amount of time given to this new \\"Christine\\".  The orgional was of course written for the voice and range of Sarah Brightman, and had so many huge musical numbers in it.  I could have done without a lot of the brassier music from the background artists in this new sequel, but I greatly enjoyed the new songs, \\"When I hear you sing\\", \\"Look with your heart\\", \\"Beneath a Moonless sky\\", \\"once upon another time\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"The Beauty underneath\\", and of course \\"love Never Dies\\"....More than enough really wonderful, powerful music to be well worth the five star rating....What I have wound up doing with my two CD's from this set, is take the songs and music that I really enjoyed, took the first trac from disc 2 as a \\"prologe\\", and then went threw and burned my own \\"highlight\\" disk.  Basically made one really enjoyable one from the two CD's.  Now on my \\"wish list\\" to Santa Claus this year, is to have Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford come out with a \\"highlights\\" CD of \\"Love Never Dies\\"....Well I can dream can't I!!!!!!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite movie hands down.  I'm a big fan too.    For the $, this set includes a digital copy and the DVD and Blu-Ray versions.  Great value, great movie, child and adult friendly.  You can't go wrong with this.  Well worth the price.
B0026P3G12|1.0|Must be older folks are liking this, I could not even get through the wild horses song..she did not do a good job on that..I have tucked this cd away forever.  not what I expected, and I got very bored and tired of it quickly.
B001FB5634|2.0|It's overly long, dull, depressing, and ultimately, nothing much happens. The story could have been told in less than an hour. I realize it's got great reviews (highly overrated, imo), but I wasn't impressed. :-\<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - the acting was superb and the concept is sobering and touching. But it's just too blah and long overall ... to the point that by the end I was glad the darn thing was over and more than a little annoyed that it took so long to get there!<br /><br />What a waste of nearly two hours.
B002ZTIILC|5.0|I have been listening to her for well over a year already, got hooked on obsessions. Been patiently waiting for her first album and although it's been released in the UK it has yet to be released here in America. Let me just tell you now she is beyond brilliant. I have had her entire album on repeat from her Myspace since it was released. I cannot wait to actually have a physical copy of it. Some of my favorite songs are Hollywood, Obsessions, I Am Not a Robot, Mowgli's Road, Guilty, Shampain, Are You Satisified, and Oh No. Honestly though the entire album is good. You won't regret purchasing it oh and incase you were wondering she sounds just as amazing or possibly more live. Saw her at SXSW this past March and I can honestly say it was the best and most genuine concert ever! Only bad thing is that her song Seventeen is not on this album.
B00275EGWY|5.0|The dialog is defenitely done by someone who has never been in the military nor knows anything about it. The equipment, uniforms and weapons are realistic enough. The actors obviously have never had to take another human life in support of our Constitution and our way of life. The sound effects are not realistic and are obviously a Hollywood production by someone who has never been in a real firefight nor a pitched battle. The militant muslims are not presented as the true religious fanatics they are who send their children and women into battle in their places. The explosions are unrealistic computer graphics done by someone with no knowledge of the characteristics of real explosions. The battles are the million round never having to reload or run out of ammunition Hollywood version. The boobytrap or Improvised Explosive Devices detonation systems are totally unrealistic and are completely figments of Hollywoods poor imagination. The psychological makeup of the soldiers is unrealistic for someone who truely has to ride the roller coaster of the boredom and stress of combat. Your average citizen who has never had to tread the dangerous path of a cop, a firemen, a paramedic, a soldier will probably enjoy the unrealistic representation of the military and combat. They may rush out and sign up for the military, end up in combat and be loaded into body bags to be sent back home when their fantasy Hollywood world and reality collide.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|This is not a movie for kids.  But for an adult with a 'just a bit different' sense of humor this is a hoot!
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I have watched Star Trek TOS and ST-TNG and Enterprise  and I like Enterprise the best.  I cannot see how so-called die hard trekkies could have so glorified TOS that they have come to revile Enterprise. TOS is a myth that grows in the minds of trekkies; the myth is completely independent of reality that TOS had paper-cut-out characters and no story line to drive you to the next episode. Heck, most of the 'going where no man had gone before' was just patrolling well defined boundaries, encountering a lot of humans along the way. When they were impressionable 12-year-olds, TOS was a revelation that became a myth that continues to expand in stature of those same trekkies who are still 12 years old. Maybe I will watch some TOS for pure nostalgia, but I'll definitely watch Enterprise again for good TV sci fi.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|I bought this set along with the Sylvania NB530SLX. The disc are not region free, they are region B. If you have bought any Blu Ray player in the US, then you can't view those disc. This is my first blu ray player, I bought it without knowing about the region situation.
B002VECMAE|3.0|Given that the US military actually considered napalm bats and pigeon-controlled bombs as weapons during WWII - not to mention the completely insane aircraft carrier made of ice idea (Project Habbakuk) produced when the Brits ingested massive quantities of LSD - the concepts proposed in The Men Who Stare at Goats is not all that unconceivable.  Having said that, the study of psy-ops has to be more interesting than the entirety of TMWSAG.<br /><br />Offbeat is probably the best way to describe the action as reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) stumbles upon Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) and the story of psychic Jedi Warriors being trained via a top-secret, unorthodox, hippy inspired, military attempt to bridge their attack on the enemy.  And that's pretty much it.  Sure, there is a subplot of betrayal, maybe even a take on animal cruelty and or drug/alcohol abuse, but mostly it feels like an assembly line of semi-connected moments, with a somewhat anti-military vibe, that never really gets funnier than a chuckle or satirical enough to keep my hand off the remote.<br /><br />Trying too hard to be quirky, disappointment ends up being the primary feeling achieved by this unfocused collection of scenes that the stellar crew - Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey also have starring roles - appears to have enjoyed filming, but not quite enough to make it a good movie.<br /><br />Jason Elin
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I love SADE, it's that simple.    Due to the relative scarcity of new Sade albums, I hardy ever look for them in the store.  I came across this album by pure accident, through a visitor who brought it to me (also a Sade fan).  I was not dissapointed.    To me at least, it seems that Sade has taken a bit of a different approach to her musical expression since Lover's Rock which was not my favorite but still a worthy listen.  I think Soldier of Love continues that trend and if I start to read into all the lyrics of the songs and listen critically to the song structure of the songs I just MIGHT start complaining.  But I simply put the cd on and let SADE do her thing ... and so I fall into her spell.  For me it's that simple, enough said.    Many thanks for another album. RESPECT and LOVE.    Please come to Canada (Toronto) for another tour so I can be there with my wife.    Always a fan, new and old.
B002ONC9NC|4.0|Jenny Mellor is a London schoolgirl, circa 1961, who has dreams of one day majoring in English Literature at Oxford University.  But, at age 16, the wise-beyond-her-years Jenny wants more out of life than just the tightly regimented routine of book-learning and cello-playing that her father assures her is essential to achieving her goal.  She yearns for a time when she will be able to think her own thoughts, be her own person, and live her own life.  That's where David Goldman comes in.  David is a dapper, smooth-talking, enticingly enigmatic older gentleman who invites Jenny into the tantalizing world of adulthood - of classical concerts, fine-dining, alcohol and cigarettes, and, of course, that mysterious, forbidden thing known as sex.  But Jenny soon learns that growing up comes with a price - primarily the loss of that moral certitude that comes with youthful innocence - and that the adult world can be a great deal crueler and trickier to maneuver through than a naïve, headstrong, know-it-all teenager may be willing to acknowledge going in.<br /><br />Astutely adapted by Nick Hornby, \\"An Education\\" is based on a memoir by Lynne Barber, an award-winning British journalist who attended Oxford before becoming a writer for \\"The Daily Telegraph,\\" \\"The Observer\\" and many other reputable publications.  Barber's tale is reflective of the kind of choices women were permitted to have in that pre-Women's Lib era of the early 1960s.  Even an abnormally bright and gifted young lady like Jenny was forced to look upon an education at Oxford more as an end in itself than as a means to some greater end.  Every adult Jenny queries as to just what exactly it is she is supposed to do with her life once she's fulfilled her requirements for graduation is left hemming and hawing in response to the question.  This applies to her teacher (Olivia Williams) and principal (Emma Thompson) at school as well as to her own parents who are stuck in a stifling, humdrum middle class existence of their own.  No wonder her head is set spinning by a man who appears to have risen above all that dreary domesticity and who can provide entr&eacute;e for her into all the priciest restaurants and poshest nightclubs in London and who can even offer her romantic get-aways to Paris on a moment`s notice.  But this is just the beginning of Jenny's \\"education,\\" as she slowly comes to realize that people are not always who they say they are, and that there is a lot more to being \\"wise\\" in the ways of the world than what one can learn from books.<br /><br />Jenny is played by Carey Mulligan in a star-making turn that earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress of 2009.  The comparisons between Ms. Mulligan and Audrey Hepburn have been noted by all who have seen or written about this film, so let me just state that her performance here is rich in grace, charm, subtlety and feistiness, and that she is most definitely a natural and commanding presence on the screen.  As David, Peter Sarsgaard is cagily manipulative without becoming sleazy or smarmy in the process, and Alfred Molina makes his mark as the well-intentioned but often bumbling and self-centered father who plays the role of stern and concerned parent - except at the moment when it matters most.<br /><br />Kudos also go to Lone Scherfig for her astute, solid and polished direction, to the movie's beautifully realized sense of place and period, and to a wonderful animated opening credit sequence that, appropriate to the era in which the movie is set, recalls the late great Saul Bass at his finest.wn.

B002EWD0I6|5.0|This is a wonderful series that just about anyone would enjoy. I plan to purchase it, however it has been shown quite often on PBS here in Atlanta. I actually was able to watch the whole of series 3 on You Tube, for anyone who cannot wait to see what happens next. It is very popular in England, so hopefully it will continue long after series three.
B002OOG6RQ|5.0|I know very little German, but this is thus far their best album yet from the best Metal band in the world. Till Lindermann's powerful masculine vocals have an appeal that goes beyond language and culture.
B002RAREAK|5.0|This album is great. I am a huge Usher fan and he did not disappoint. I can listen to the whole album without skipping a song. OMG will be the biggest song/hit of the year. Pro Lover, Fooling Around, Making Love, Mars vs. Venus, are my fave songs on the album. The whole album is great. For the people that have gave this album a bad rating must not no good music. Usher is a world wide star not just r&b, so him having a pop/r&b album reaches more than one audience. Go Usher!!!!!!!!!11
B000PWQPAC|5.0|the movie was great, a lot less confusing than the others, worked much more like the series.
0793518326|5.0|Terrific product with a lot a useful information.  In spite of other's opinions, the scores seem to be pretty accurate and can certainly provide guidance to improving your understanding of how the Beatles did their songs.  I am enjoying a lot.
B000UD08HW|4.0|I have listened to a few Blu-ray music performances and I will say that this one lacks \\"sound quality\\".  I got Led Zeppelin's The Song Remains the Same and it sounds like nothing I had ever heard before.  It was like they were playing \\"live\\" in my living room.  There was so much depth in the sound that it blew away anything I had heard before on CD or Vinyl.  Now after saying that the Performance is great, and it does sound great, I have even heard the DVD and the Blu-Ray does sound better but it seems to lack depth in the mix. I do not believe this is a \\"Blu-Ray\\" flaw but probably the original master tapes taken from this performance are not the best sounding.    And Time from Dark Side of the Moon performance was ruined by the bass play playing the ticking clock too fast on bass making the intro rushed and almost unlistenable.    It is a great buy and I will play this many times but I cannot play this for people to show audio superiority of Blu-ray.    This is why I am giving it 4 stars.
0385532458|5.0|In this fascinating collection of short stories, Grisham shows his characteristic flare for interesting characters and situations, as well as his ability to turn a plot on a legal storyline. The seven stories in this collection demonstrate a nice variety of characters and plot, some having tinges of a more traditional Grisham legal thriller and some having no legal theme at all. They are all held together, though, by their setting in Ford County, Mississippi, which readers will recall from books like A Time to Kill, The Last Juror, and The Summons. In all, I greatly enjoyed these seven tales. For me they evoked the feeling of Flannery O'Connor's grotesque southern fiction, especially evident in Grisham's colorful characters and sometimes nearly ridiculous encounters, though they always stay true enough to life to stay in the realm of the plausible. A few of these stories could easily have been the seeds of full-length novels, but all stood well as short stories. Though a departure from his usual format, these stories may be some of his best writing yet.
B001B1T7BU|5.0|I purchased this to show a large group ages 4-11 and it was perfect.  Dogs are always a sure thing with the kids.
B002VWNIAY|4.0|PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS THE STANDARD VERSION (you can even see this text on the provided image if you enlarge it...do not be deceived!)
B002BIULQC|5.0|Excellent service. Super fast shipping! This was cheaper than Walmart and delivered right to our door. Thanks.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i thought this book was amazing. i really enjoyed it's themes of family and loyalty and living life on your own terms not being forced by any government rules. i easily put this book in the same breath in mentioning to kill a mockingbird or the learning tree, 1984, animal farm and so many other impactful novels. i would like to say thank you to suzanne collins for a terrific read.
B000002L68|5.0|This album was a gift for my husband. We both love Prince, but agree that all of his best work was done in the 1980s. All of these songs are awesome and we love the album.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|I have to say that before receiving the DVD I thought that it wouldn't top the Confessions Tour DVD at all.. I'm wrong. The show has something special about it, It's more fun, more energetic and above all you can clearly see that Madonna is happy while performing and giving her best. Confessions was greater on the \\"arty\\" side, this show focuses on the Fun and Energy. The last DVD release where you can see Madonna this much happy I believe was \\"ciao Italia\\".    I am really pleased with it, the show was filmed in a much better way than confessions, picture quality is amazing and the stadium atmosphere really adds to its greatness. I really recommend this DVD it will not disappoint.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|Just watched the Blu-ray 50th anniversary edition of this film and it was INCREDIBLE.  Like seeing it for the first time on the screen.  5 stars all around for restoration and extras.
B000TXZVGQ|4.0|So I love MSCL.  I was 15 when it aired, and to this day I wish it hadn't been canceled.  Kudos for SHOUT! though.  Because of them I have Undeclared, Freaks and Geeks and MSCL on DVD.      There are only two things that would have made it better.  One, I would have liked to have more extras.  I know that may be impossible since this series existed before the crazy technology era, so they probably don't have much behind the scenes video available. Second, I was so excited by the commentary option, but was pretty bored with it once I actually listened to it. My favorite episode \\"Self Esteem\\" had commentary with Claire Danes and Winnie Holzman, which I couldn't wait to hear.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be just a bunch of laughing and nonsense.  They barely gave any insight to the episode.  Same is true of the other commentaries so I suggest only watching the episodes.  Of course, if you love hearing artists overuse words like \\"organically\\" -- then you'll love the commentaries. Claire Danes's over-enunciation might not get on your nerves either.
0385504225|5.0|I enjoyed this book and I could not get enough of it. Dan Brown is amazing!
B002N3GD8K|1.0|This woman with limited vocal talent became the major female star of the late 80's and 90's; however, her vocal limites have created some questionable releases including this one.  Can she sing?  Within reason.  Is she talented?  Yes.  Is she to the point of releasing material that is waste?  Yes.  This is a prime example.  Her last 3 releases were not worth the money to buy and she is not worth the money.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|The blu-ray has the best extras I've ever seen with a movie.  The extras cover each part of the movie making process in great detail and the director confirms that Top Gun had an intentional homo-erotic overtone.  This is a mandatory purchase for any blu-ray collection.  It helps that Top Gun is a great movie with a great soundtrack.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead rocks in general but this is their tour de force.  If you're new to the band and enjoyed In Rainbows, OK Computer will cause rock-induced convulsions of joy!  It's that good. Buy it now.
B000Y7U98W|2.0|Great soundtrack and sound effects.  Ultra-clear blu ray quality.  The first 2/3 of the movie are interesting and create a good sense of dread, but the last 1/3 of the movie seems to have been spliced in from some random 80's horror flick and it completely ruins the movie.  I would rent it at most.  Not a buy.
B002ZFQD04|3.0|I, like many gays, was ecstatic to find out that Madonna was going to tour in support of her 2008 work, [[ASIN:B0015D3Z4O Hard Candy]]. As the kick off date approached, rumored set lists leaked- my first reaction- wow! tragedy!!! When you see Madge, you expect the classics, which, on this tour, we got, but the arrangements were extremely similar to the [[ASIN:B000KGGLCK Madonna - The Confessions Tour]], which i think was one of her BEST tours, behind Blond Ambition. I was lucky enough to get 8th row tickets to the Los Angeles show at Dodger Stadium. In my opinion, THAT show should have been taped- Madonna, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake? 3 Names that define Pop Music!     The show, on the whole, was blah. Here's a 51 year old woman- AMAZING shape for her age (or any age at that), HOT MAMA, but the wardrobe was too revealing, the woman's all muscle. not too attractive. There were four acts to the show: Pimp, Retro, Gypsy, and Rave.     Pimp: Madonna opens with Candy Shop. She's spun on a circular lift, sitting on a throne. i expected nothing less from the queen! Great costume(short shorts, killer boots, Amazing Givenchy jacket on, which is removed halfway thru the number, cane in hand), great dancing (the type of dancing and strutting Maddy is known for), and good vocals. Then comes Beat Goes On, little by little, she moves articles of clothing. On this song, we see a collabo vid of Pharell and kanye. By the end of the song, she's in a bra and boy shorts. NO NO NO! Next comes, Human Nature, during which madonna plays her guitar. LOVED it. Britney makes a cameo via video. Next, Vogue, one of the highlights of the show.     Retro: The hommage to the past. Classics are played, \\"Get Into the Groove,\\" \\"Borderline,\\" \\"Music,\\" and newbies like \\"Heartbeat\\" and \\"She's Not Me.\\"     Gypsy: Songs performed very to the rhythm of the Confessions and Drowned World Tour. This is where She needs to work more with Jamie King, the producer of the show, to come up with new concepts. Its becoming a recycled show all of a sudden. The best part of this section is the costuming. WOW! Moving renditions of \\"You Must Love Me,\\" \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You,\\" and \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina.\\"    Rave: The high of the show. Great lighting, vocals, and videos. Truly feel like you're tripping on acid. LOVED IT! Wonderful reworked version of Like a Prayer. That's really only on this one song. The remainder of the show, Madonna works her inner rockstar guitarist. She plays Ray of Light and Hung Up on the guitar- very much like on the Confessions and Re-Invention Tour. Give It To Me closes the show. It is sung like the regular recording version but YET AGAIN, in the styles of the Confessions, Re-Invention, and Drowned World tour, as the song is over, she starts singing the chorus yet again, goes down the runway, has fans sing along with her, and ends the show on the main platform as she is spun around to the backstage area, just as she started the show. Again, the video screens read \\"Game Over,\\" a message shown on the screen that remind me of \\"Have you Confessed?\\" (Conf. Tour) and \\"Re-Invent Yourself! (RI Tour).     I LOOOOVE Madge much more than the next guy, but she needs new ideas for each tour. It is disappointing to fans when you pay to see a spectacle and end up with bits and pieces of old shows. did you cut and paste ideas? Your fans made this the highest grossing female solo tour of all time, the least you can do is give them originality.  Please Please Please change it up for the next tour!!! Also, bring back songs that haven't been performed, you def need to retire some new age songs that you perform like Hung Up, Ray of Light, and La Isla Bonita.
B0036XN2L2|2.0|I am a big Scorpions fan from the early 80's however I can't congratulate them on a new record, especially considering their announcement that it is to be their final. If they had really wanted to end their career on a high note they should have done it with their previous album - Humanity Hour 1. That was a truly GREAT later days Scorpions record. (It Still wasn't as brilliant as \\"Love at First Sting\\", \\"Blackout\\" or \\"Pure Instinct\\", which I consider their best albums of all time - a true classics of Rock Music as a whole) but was still very, very good.   And \\"SITT\\" just can't compare to it - IMHO, the songwriting is weak and uninspired by Scorpions standards, just to summarize it all. I think it's not time for them to go - they should release at least one more truly great album.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I never read the books but I have heard that a lot of stuff is missing from this movie that is in the books. However since I have not read the books the movie was great to me. I enjoyed every minute of the movie.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|If you're a fan of 'Bad Cinema' like I am, then you will LOVE this '5 Star TRASHTERPIECE!' Bad acting, unintentionally hysterical dialogue, melodramatic plot developments, THANK YOU screenwriter, Joe Eztheras and director, Paul Verhoeven! Every time I come across this film on TV I am glued to the screen as if I were rubbernecking while driving by a car wreck. An utterly fascinating film for all the wrong reasons. This is the 'Citizen Kane' of Bad Cinema!
0440236304|3.0|This book is written in common language and easy to read.  Some parts seem a little far-fetched, though.  Over all it is still a good read for WWII or paratrooper buffs.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber will did not let me down with this one.  I feel like I am in the theater when listening to this.
1423119509|5.0|I am very happy that I purchased this book series.  I received it competely un-damaged and the collectors chest is pretty cool.  I had never heard of Percy Jackson and the Olympians until my friend and I were talking about Harry Potter and he said this series is similar to the Potter series.  Even though the two are very similar, they are VERY different as well.  I just finished the last book today and I am sure I will read the series again in a few months.  Bottom line: if you like action, adventure and a little suspense, this series if perfect for you!
0385341008|1.0|I'm at page 22 and can't bear to read any further.  The big turn-off is the \\"voice\\" which, in no way, reflects the writing style of the era.  So far, it's a disjointed, concoction of scribbled gossip. I always finish a book, but not this one!
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Well, the long awaited remake of Clash of the Titans is here, and as with all remakes, the story/screen play is always redone heavily. The Stop-Motion that Ray Haryhausen had done for the original has been abandoned in favor of the slicker looking CG. It's not always a good bet, bad CG is just that...Bad. While it wasn't terrible in the re-make it wasn't the best that this film deserved and that is reflective in the story as well.   While some things were swapped, new characters invented, and other parts of the original story re-arranged it wasn't a terrible film. The original was far slower and well...a bit hokier to say the least. The new rendition of Clash of the Titans went for a faster moving storyline while adopting the George Miller \\"300\\" look and feel, only to fall short.   There were some good scenes and action, the remake of this classic falls short. Kids will love the FX (and why they wouldn't?).I also imagine there will be a play station or X-Box release of this film into the game world. In the end, this was a film that has A-list actors taking an easy pay day and while Sam Worthington is the \\"new, hot Aussie\\" in the sights of Hollywood, this isn't a film I'd be boasting about on my resume.  Worthington's performance is often \\"wooden\\" and much the same as seen in other films like Terminator 4 and his other overrated  \\"big blockbuster\\" Avatar. Well,at least he is consistant, but \\"much of the same\\" is just that...\\"the generic and fake action hero\\" portrayal seen in all his parts.   The other thing that eludes me the casting. Why does Hollywood insist on casting actors with Australian,Irish and British accents?Because they have accents? Lame. This was/is suppose to be a Greek story/fable. There were no limies around back then on the Greek islands.  It is worth renting, but this film is a poor rendition and seems only cheapened as the Hollywood money machine turns for the allmighty dollar and produces only an  feeble product in the end. Shame on the studios,actors for agreeing to this project. It could have been a spectacular film and instead of really taking care to make something worthy of re-making the 1980 Harryhausen classic it only deficates on it with a lousy T.V series story/plot,action and really bad CG.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Combines detective fiction and police drama with a touch of screwball comedy. Has GREAT quotable lines! \\"was that meant to be an insult, because Nancy Drew solved all her cases\\"
B001O2MBMI|5.0|I was never into any of the American Idols or X Factor winners for the longest time. I just always felt like artists should work hard and make a demo and send it to the record companies and still feel like this for the most part. The exception is this powerful force, Leona.<br /><br />Not since 1991 when I discovered Mariah Carey has any female artist moved me or blown me away or amazed me or sent shivers down my spine the way Leona does. Leona sings with so much soul and emotion and passion.<br /><br />I find myself on the verge of tears with pretty much every song on here because Leona's voice is just so breathtaking. I also find myself stop breathing during many times throughout the album due to her incredible power. You just cannot call yourself a true vocalist fan and not fall in love with Leona as a singer. She sings in so many different ways and tones and every song is incredible.<br /><br />The songs on this album that just really move me the most and completely make me a true fan of Leona are Run, Bleeding Love, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, Take A Bow and Footprints In the Sand. It's as if Leona wrote these songs just for me. I feel like this whole album was made just for me but these especially are my #1 favorites.<br /><br />Run is hands down the most amazing, beautiful, breathtaking song I've heard since I heard Mariah Carey's Anytime You Need A Friend in 1993. Words just cannot express how much I love her version. It's so much better than the original and makes me start to cry. I especially love the part in the middle when Leona is vocalizing.<br /><br />Take A Bow is just so epic and I love everything about the song lyrically, musically, melodically and vocally. I really love the whole theme of this song and reminds me of Phantom Of The Opera and my favorite actor Charles Dance and my favorite actress Dame Judi Dench. This is what should be Leona's second single and deserves to get #1. I just cannot get enough of this song and cannot recommend it enough. It has #1 written all over it!<br /><br />Footprints In The Sand is a beautiful Gospel ballad that is based off the Footprints passage written by Mary Stevenson:<br /><br />One night a man had a dream. He dreamed<br />he was walking along the beach with the LORD.<br /><br />Across the sky flashed scenes from his life.<br />For each scene he noticed two sets of<br />footprints in the sand: one belonging<br />To him, and the other to the LORD.<br /><br />When the last scene of his life flashed before him,<br />He looked back at the footprints in the sand.<br /><br />He noticed that many times along the path of<br />his life there was only one set of footprints.<br /><br />He also noticed that it happened at the very<br />lowest and saddest times in his life.<br /><br />This really bothered him and he<br />questioned the LORD about it:<br /><br />\\"LORD, you said that once I decided to follow<br />you, you'd walk with me all the way.<br />But I have noticed that during the most<br />troublesome times in my life,<br />there is only one set of footprints.<br />I don't understand why when<br />I needed you most you would leave me.\\"<br /><br />The LORD replied:<br /><br />\\"My son, my precious child,<br />I love you and I would never leave you.<br />During your times of trial and suffering,<br />when you see only one set of footprints,<br />it was then that I carried you.\\"<br /><br />Again, the melody, lyrics, music and vocals are just simply breathtaking. Leona won me over with this beautiful ballad.<br /><br />Bleeding Love is my next favorite and then Take A Bow and Footprints In The Sand. It definitely deserved #1 and I just LOVE the way she sings on this song.<br /><br />I also bought the UK version prior to this version which has another amazing ballad called Homeless. It is so emotional and powerful and recommend listening to that track as soon as possible. They removed that masterpiece from this US release which is a shame but the album is flawless regardless.<br /><br />Leona's version of First Time Ever I Saw Your Face completely blows the other versions out of the water. I've always loved Celine's version and never thought I'd love another version more until I heard Leona's. Leona sings this with such passion and emotion.<br /><br />Here I Am is an awesome album closer and just one of the greatest ballads ever. Another masterpiece!<br /><br />The remix of Bleeding Love is really cool on this version.<br /><br />Every song on this album is incredible and full of power and soul and emotion and different styles and it really deserves to be #1. If you love the TRUE singing with power, you will not be disappointed with this album. Leona is everything I love about vocalists and she IS music itself.

0805091742|4.0|The book gives a very nice view about the history of this simple tool, how it was first introduced in the aviation industry and how it works (and the proven benefit of using it) in other complex industries such as construction.<br /><br />Two specific types of checklist are mentioned (DO-CONFIRM vs. READ-DO) as well as the criteria to elaborate other useful ones: clear, short, and specific about how and when to use them.<br /><br />It also describes with a lot of detail the effort the author took to elaborate useful checklists for the medical area, the difficulties to make them accepted, and the benefits they provided once in place.<br /><br />Probably my only criticism with this book is that I found some of the stories a little too repetitive and a little too long. But other than that, I enjoyed the book.
1563899426|3.0|Was really interested when I came across this series. I liked the idea of the fairy tale characters living in modern times. Once I started reading I read it the whole way through which didn't take long cause it clocks in around 120 pages. I liked that it had a way more Grimm Brother's than Disney take on the characters. Snow(Snow White)is basically the vice pres(she handles everything and does the dirty work)of Fabletown where all the tales live. She learns that her sister Rose Red may have been the victim of a violent crime. Rose's boyfriend Jack(Jack+the beanstalk) comes to Mister Wolf(yes the wolf of three little pigs) who is the \\"sheriff\\" of Fabletown. Thus begins the journey to find Rose or what's left of her and figure out just what happend in the first place. The characters have taken a complete 180 from the characters you remember but it makes them realistic and human. Snow White and Prince Charming did not live Happily Ever After and the Wolf is being guilt tripped by one of the pigs. Gave it only three stars cause i was expecting a little more out of it although it was good. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series and hope that it only gets better from here.
B0026P3G12|5.0|To be honest, I do NOT like the entire album.  It's an odd mix of songs to say the least.  HOWEVER, the one song that makes this album worth having is the song, \\"Wild Horses\\".  It has been years since I've heard a song so outrageouly beautiful!!  She sings this song with such tenderness yet with such determination that I was totally blown away the first time I heard it on TV.  The only thing that has held her back, from what I have read, for the past 30 years is her looks.  WHO THE HELL cares about her looks when she has the voice of an angel!!!  I LOVE THIS SONG!!!  The other night, that song went through my mind ALL evening!... and I was hearing it in my mind as I went to sleep.  Absolutely unforgettable.  It's almost an atrocity that she has been held back so many years simply because she didn't look like Beyonce!!!... a crying shame!!!  I wish her absolutely the best. She deserves it!!
B0029O08WA|3.0|I'll start off by saying I'm not a super huge Twilight fan it was just ok for me, but I did like the soundtrack. They picked a bunch of artists I liked some I didn't but they worked well together and made it good, it worked. New Moon not so much the movie was less ok and the soundtrack wasn't all that good either. If you thought(like me) that the movie drug out, so does the soundtrack. Three stars are for the few songs that actually are good, like Lykee Li's Possibility and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's Done All Wrong. These songs are good and worked well in the movie. The trailer track in Death Cab For Cutie's Meet Me On The Equinox had it's place too although I don't really like it, it worked. The rest I feel are good as small pieces sprinkled through out but not really a fan of the whole song. This soundtrack is missing that signature song that Paramore forged w/ Decode on the Twilight soundtrack. It's missing that piece that holds it all together. New Moon's soundtrack is definately more for the indie fan and I wouldn't recommend purchasing this just because you liked the Twilight soundtrack. I would suggest borrowing from the library or a friend and if you like it go from there.

B002RAREAK|1.0|I am a huge Usher FAN! I use to fantasize about him being my husband. I have spent countless of dollars on his concerts just to make sure that I can sit close enough so that I can see his sweat as he dances. I am beyond disappointed; this is by far the worse Usher album in history. I do not know what he was thinking. I think he is going through so much with his personal life that he is failing to focus on his music. The cd was very popish it lacked substance and true Usher R&B. Although, his last album was much different than his previous releases Here I Stand was a very solid album. I think that he should take some time off and focus on his personal life and then come back stronger than ever. I do not like any of the songs on the cd. I listened to the cd more than ten times trying to like it but I just could not. Nothing on the cd appeals to me and some of the featuring artists on the CD are rather annoying (nicki minaj). This is the biggest let down of the year and will probably be the biggest let down in rnb history until Usher comes out with a better cd.

B002T45VX6|4.0|I didn;t like She Wolf at first, the song really just bugged me, and the video soo did not help. But when she released the song with Lil Wayne, well, he is gold, so I loved it. But on my way to work one day, i was running late, her video for Did It Agagin came on and i COULD NOT look away! im serious, I was enraptured. So I went and bought the disc on my break, and i really enjoy it. Men In This Town is Shakira gold, I loved this song from first listen, where she gets all techno-ish with the \\"Im so fresh, Im so Clean, got the look and got the skin...\\" I love that. And Gypsy is amazing as well, overall its a solid release, although i would have liked there to be more songs rather than the live track spanish versions...
B000MCIBB6|5.0|Just got it Today.  Nothing but listen to it so far.  This CD is a masterpiece of art... put together flawlessly.  I ordered next day delivery, and recieved it, carefully packaged, at approximately 10 a.m. the next day. I strongly emphasize the importance of obtaining this collector's item to all d o o r s fans, young and old, there or around.  At least half of the d o o r s best songs on this album. Don't knock and leave... open this door!

B0039OGGVQ|5.0|Granted, some records you have to listen to a couple of times before you fully digest them and enjoy them. But this is Slash... it's good old fashioned Rock n' Roll. I've only listen to it once, may be after a couple of days I'll be able to write something more \\"in depth.\\" For now, what comes to mind is that feeling I got when I first heard Contraband... rock is not dead after all. It sounds what Guns would sound like if Slash and company hadn't departed.
0552998486|4.0|This is the story of Vianne and her daughter Anook who have travelled to a small village in France. Vianne decides to settle for a while and leases a former bakery to set up her chocolate shop.  They are met with suspicion, being outsiders and non-church goers. There is additional tension as the shop opens at the start of Lent. I had seen the movie before reading the book, but being a fan of Joanne Harris I was curious to see how the book differed. Her descriptions are wonderful, and the book has more magic than the movie. The relationship between Vianne and Roux, the river gypsy, is more complex in the book and it is intriguing to see the perspective of the priest in several of the chapters and more of his backstory. Armande, the grande dame for whom Vianne helps to reunite with her grandson, is similar in both, but in some ways more stubborn and stronger in the book. This was one of the rare cases where I like each treatment for different reasons. It was worth reading and I look forward to reading the sequel.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|This movie is a bit different.  It does have vodoo in it, but as the movie is set in New Orleans, that is a reasonable choice to have for the basis of the villian.  While many people have posted that it is too scary, both my 3 year old and 6 year old girls love it, as does my 2 year old nephew.      For the people screaming about racism, this movie is set in an older time in classic New Orleans.  The rich guy is a white which only makes since for the time.  Tiana and her mom both come from a poor section of the city, but it shows strength of character to work hard and go after her dreams.  The complaints that America does not have royality really do not make sense to me, because the movie does not claim that anyone in America is royality.  They do mention the Marty Gras Princess to change the spell.    For those that worry about the religion, well, the vodoo parts are dark.  They shoe the shadow man being dragged off, but not necessarly to hell as many posters claim.  He fell victim to his own schemes, something they have done to many villians in Disney movies, examples including Beauty and the Beast, Tarzan, and Hunchback.    We also loved the music.  My girls love dancing to it.  Overall, we have really enjoyed it.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|The best sci-fi (heck of all time) show!  I waited for the April 6, 2010 release because of the packaging of the other complete blu ray set.  This package is one overall box that contains the 4 seasons in seperate boxes.  Those boxes unfold into three sections.  The Plan is also included as a seperate disc and case.  Razor is a disc included in the 4th season box.

B0001WGDX0|5.0|I ordered this five-CD set and received it in a timely fashion.  There was a caveat in the packing notes indicating any problems w/ the product would have to be noted w/in 7 days.  So I listened to all the symphonies [which were great, of course] but four of the five CD's \\"skipped.\\"  I was not happy with the product condition so I followed directions to return.  I was not getting a reply via the route described in the paperwork so I emailed the company, informed them of the problem not only with the CDs but with attempting to obtain an RA number and they quickly mailed a postage-paid return envelope to me.  I returned the product on 3-20-10 and checked with the company on 4-5-10 to learn they have still not received the returned CD set!  I am still out the money I paid and I will not buy CDs/any product from this company again.

Unfortunately, that download is no longer free. Anyway, after reading that, I wanted more from Anderson. This is a great book. It opened my eyes to things I was already seeing - he explains why these things are happening, how to take advantage of them, and how to speed them up. These things are the shifts in the economy that are being created by technology. The book is very well written, and an easy read.
B000001DWG|4.0|I am not a man of much words, but found this CD to have a niche in my CD collection.  I expected pre grunge sounds, but will go out on a limb.  I think they sound a bit like Guns & Roses, not Pearl Jam.  I have liked what I listened to so far and would reccomend this CD for anyone into progressive round / rock.  And it is nice to see a CD comp with 17 songs on it, not 8 like some groups!  Overall it is a great buy used on Amazon - you will not be disappointed.

Once installed, they stay attached unless you drop the controller from particularly high.  They feel and look like they came with the original controller, and vastly improve my gaming experience.  Every now and then i take the triggers off and try playing just to remind myself why i love them so much.  Playing without them is horrible now!    Since buying my first pair, i have bought 2 more--one for my 2nd controller, and one for the 2nd controller (the one i use) at my friend's house!
B000001DYA|5.0|Great heavy rock band that sounds like guys getting together in a garage, turning the amps up and just letting it flow.  Has a sycadelic feel to it but with a heavy edge to it.

0307454541|2.0|With all the hype surrounding the upcoming movie, I decided to read the book first. I saw the trailer with Clash of the Titans and I thought it looked pretty interesting, so with the bookstore being in the same area as the theatre, I decided to go pick it up.<br /><br />OK, first off, this isn't a bad book. If you get past the boring writing and the cliche storyline, I guess you'd like it. The storyline is pretty basic- someone goes missing and a reporter and his sidekick, a girl who was abused in her childhood, try to investigate it. There's more to it than that: the reporter, Mikael, is facing a three month jail sentence for libel, and Lisbeth, the \\"girl with the dragon tattoo\\" and the sidekick, is a computer hacker with Asperger's.<br /><br />To be honest I did find this book interesting. Sure the plot is rather cliche at best but but it gets more and more interesting. Lisbeth is a likeable character- she is very smart and always has a way of solving things.<br /><br />But that's where it stopped.<br /><br />The writing in this book is very poor, although that may be in part due to the translation. The dialogue is very cliched and hardly a single memorable quote comes out of the characters' mouths. People say things like \\"I know why you feel like that but I'm going to have to disagree\\" or \\"That story is complete bull\\".  Also, there is a great deal of bad grammar. Paraphrasing here, there's a page where it says \\"he turned the corner and saw someone quite else sitting on the porch.\\" Someone quite else???<br /><br />Also, another thing is that Larsson does too much telling and not enough showing. An example, again, paraphrasing here, would be \\"He made two sandwiches for himself. Then he put on a pot of coffee. He was uninterested is eating. He fed some of his sausage to the cat.\\" (I'm not kidding, sentences describing situations like that happen in almost every third chapter!!!!) There's plenty more boring writing here. Having my copy, I just randomly opened the pages and came across:<br /><br />\\"The judgement was twenty-six pages long. It set out the reasons for finding Blomvkist guilty on fifteen accounts of aggrivated libel of the businessman Hans Erik Wennerstrom. So each count cost him a thousand kronor and six days in gaol.\\"<br /><br />Again too much telling and not enough showing. Again, like I said this could be due in part to the translation but still, this is incredibly boring as hell writing.<br /><br />Also, this book is FAR too long. This book would be half its length if Larsson had chilled on the descriptions and overwriting. That isn't to say it's a bad book. It was interesting. But the writing is incredibly poor and you can tell it was Larsson's first book.was twenty-six pages long. It set out the reasons for finding Blomvkist guilty on fifteen accounts of aggrivated libel of the businessman Hans Erik Wennerstrom. So each count cost him a thousand kronor and six days in gaol.\\"    Again too much telling and not enough showing.

B00386OWUC|5.0|And here I'd thought I had an original thought -- similar to the writer's thoughts in the Amazon editorial review, I walked out of my local art house feeling like I'd just finished a very disturbing, emotionally draining, beautifully shot Twilight Zone episode.<br /><br />It really is an apt comparison. The film is shot in black and white, characters just don't seem fully present, like spooky people in old Twilight episodes often appear. Add to that a distinctly eerie lack of soundtrack, and it's almost as if you're watching an alternate universe.<br /><br />Of course, wouldn't we all like to believe the Holocaust never happened? Wouldn't we all just like to pretend it's a product of mass over-imaginative hysteria? Or an alternate history? Or something akin to the War of the Worlds scare?<br /><br />Why yes, we would. But no, we can't.<br /><br />Many a criticism has been lobbed at this film, and depending on the critical perspective you choose to employ, the criticism is quite accurate: Are we to believe that the holocaust was made possible because of the manner in which a generation of German children were raised? Of course not. But that's not the point of the film, and to criticize the film from that perspective says more about the reviewer's discomfort with the more disturbing elements of the film. Simply put: this film is NOT meant to be any sort of factually based indictment of Germanic parenting. Leave that to documentary, not fiction, if such a case can be made.<br /><br />Instead, let's not forget that film can also be a work of art, the product of a writer and director's imagination, an expression of identity, a record of simply nothing more than what might have been on the writer's or director's mind as the content of the film was created and revised.<br /><br />Isn't that enough?<br /><br />The White Ribbon is a brilliant, beautiful, ugly and abhorrent masterpiece. By all means, see it.

B002ZTQVGQ|2.0|I am a fan of Miyazaki's films and was unhappy with this recent release. Yes, it's for a younger age group, but kids are pretty sharp and I felt that the movie was dumbed down unnecessarily. The visuals are fantastic, but the story plods along, and after a while I was just waiting for it to be over. I never felt any connection to the characters and just plain didn't care what happened to them, which to me means the movie missed its mark. Also, some things happened that seemed totally nonsensical--for example, the mother drives with her son through flooding streets and a dangerous storm rather than follow the official's advice to evacuate. Why put your son in danger like that? Other things happened and I felt that there was no explanation given for them, leaving the story feeling choppy. I wouldn't bother to watch this movie; I felt that it skated on the reputation of an admired artist and didn't deserve the credit it received.

0060557818|4.0|Richard Mayhew doesn't entirely belong. He's a Scot in London, an office worker who can't meet deadlines, and a man whose fiancee thinks he would be just perfect if only he'd change ... most everything. But it's not until he aids Door, a mysterious young woman who he finds bleeding in the street, that things really start falling apart.<br /><br />Richard quickly learns that London has a dark, dangerous, and magical underside, one that is almost entirely invisible to the city's respectable folks. In this hidden world people speak to and are somehow ruled by rats, a girl has the power to open anything, and an angel lives in a cathedral. In this same world, Door's family is brutally murdered, a young woman is simply sucked away into darkness, and the inhuman and implacable assassins Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar (eerily reminiscent of the bantering assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd from the Bond flick \\"Diamonds are Forever\\") terrorize everyone in the service of their secretive employer. Richard, cast out of his own world, has no choice but enter this world and help Door to find out who killed her family and why.<br /><br />Though some of the details are fresh and entertaining, this is a familiar story. Richard is Bilbo Baggins is Arthur Dent, a bit of a misfit without any real survival skills thrust suddenly into a new and dangerous milieu. He may not become a hero, exactly, but he finds an inner strength he never knew he had and discovers that there's more to life than he had ever realized.<br /><br />Richard's a sweet guy, and it's a sweet story, and, truth be told, people in the invisible world never really liked the upstairs world and are pretty content with their lot. For both better and worse, Neil Gaiman is no China Mieville, and he's no Charles de Lint, either. That's fine. There's plenty of room in this world for a guy who writes tales with both thrills and laughs like STARDUST and NEVERWHERE and AMERICAN GODS, flirting with danger and darkness but never really going there. If you don't mind dark fantasy that's light and sweet, try this one.mind dark fantasy that's light and sweet, try this one.

B002MHTHQ2|4.0|Ray Charles' helped inaugurate the Impulse! label with this 1961 release, the label's second album. Produced by Creed Taylor, and recorded in the same New Jersey studios that hosted Jimmy Smith and other Blue Note greats, Charles sat himself behind a Hammond B-3 and together with key members of the Count Basie band, he swung arrangements written by Quincy Jones and Ralph Burns. From the opening horn stabs of \\"From the Heart\\" it's clear that this band plays big, brassy and hard, yet Charles keeps it cool on the organ, and his two vocal numbers (\\"I've Got News For You\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town\\"), are blue and soulful. Charles gave the band and its soloists plenty of room to shine, but when his keys step to the front, such as his growling lead on \\"One Mint Julep,\\" it's clear whose leading the sessions.<br /><br />Concord's two-CD reissue adds three albums that Charles recorded in the 1970s: [[ASIN:B0027D4SFQ My Kind of Jazz]] (1970), [[ASIN:B0027D9N92 Jazz Number II]] (1972) and [[ASIN:B0027DDKTG My Kind of Jazz Part 3]] (1975). These are primarily instrumental albums and are filled with the sort of charts used to warm up audiences at Charles' live shows. There is a generous helping of 3/4 jazz waltzes and Latin rhythms. Recorded with his road band, the lineup is filled with instrumental stars, including Blue Mitchell, Joe Randazzo, Clifford Scott, David \\"Fathead\\" Newman and many others. Highlights include the Stax-styled groove of \\"Booty-Butt\\" and a bubbly take on Lee Morgan's \\"Sidewinder.\\" As an additional bonus, a cover of \\"Misty\\" is included from trombonist Steve Turre's [[ASIN:B00004TUOZ In the Spur of the Moment]].<br /><br />The recording quality is superb, with a super wide stereo image. Remastering is by Paul Blakemore at Telarc. The set's 12-page booklet includes new liner notes by Ralph Friedwald, original album notes by Dick Katz and Quincy Jones, and full-panel cover reproductions. The original sessions show Charles at full power; the 1970s albums feature great playing, but often feel like pre-show warmups. If you already have Genius + Soul = Jazz in high fidelity, the upgrade may not be necessary, but if you haven't yet enjoyed Charles' 1961 classic, this is a great way to hear it.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|There are so many well-written five-star reviews here I need add little, except to say that this show features one of the best ensemble casts, some of the most gripping writing and one of the most morally complex anti-hero protagonists I've ever encountered on television.  And while I'm tossing about superlatives like confetti, let me say that the 2nd season opener is for me the single best thriller episode I can ever remember seeing.  The dinging of that old man's bell is unbearably nerve-jangling, and the actor who plays bad guy Tuco Salamanca is incredible.  I will also say that Season Three is shaping up to exceed my expectations.  I wondered how far they could go after Season Two's end, but they made a brilliant decision: to transfer much of the soul-wringing angst of Walter White's internal Civil War onto his wife Skyler.  Amy Gunn is an astounding actress, and I'm not sure the first two seasons scratched the surface of what she can do.  From all indications, Season Three is changing that.

Among many lessons in the book, the most important that I learned are:    1. Running barefoot is how are bodies were meant to run.  For those of us getting injured while running in conventional running shoes, there is nothing wrong with out feet, there is however something very wrong with the shoes.    2. Eating as if we are poor (beans, grains, vegetables) really does give us better health.    3. We run too fast during our long runs and too slow during our speed work.    4. Love running.

0192805606|5.0|In what many call her most autobiographical novel, Virginia Woolf creates a warm and intimate  portrait of a family which resembles her own-her parents, brothers and sisters-and the friends with whom they enjoy their summer vacation on the Isle of Skye in the Hebrides.  Mrs. Ramsay, the mother of eight children, is the linchpin of the fictional family.  She adores her husband, and though she often feels she fails him, she persists in smoothing his way so that he can work, managing the house and children, and inviting large groups of his students and friends to visit.  Often strict and always right, Mr. Ramsay loves being the center of praise, but rarely praises others, and is often insensitive to the hopes and dreams of his children.<br /><br />In Part I, Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay, their children, several women and men (including philosophy students), for whom Mrs. Ramsay enjoys acting as a matchmaker, all contribute their thoughts as Virginia Woolf explores some of her favorite themes during the course of one day on the island.  Mrs. Ramsay's running commentary on her everyday life emphasizes her vision of the role of women and opens the question of whether or not it is possible for women to find a meaningful role in life outside of marriage.  The importance of the thinking life-with peripheral attention paid also to the artistically creative life-reflects the intellectual climate of England in the lead-up to the First World War, and the desire of many thinkers to create a significant intellectual legacy which will survive them.<br /><br />Part II, a brief bridge, ten years later, focuses on the changes which have taken place.  The war has begun and ended.  Many key characters have died, and Mr. Ramsay, devastated, also fears that all his writing will have been for naught.  In Part Three, what's left of the family returns to the house on Skye for a visit after a ten year absence.  Perhaps showing his personal growth and desire to atone for his previous insensitivity to James's desires, Mr. Ramsay now insists on making the trip to the lighthouse with teenagers James and his younger sister Cam, though James is no longer even interested in going.  James commands the boat, however, and receives unaccustomed praise.  Back on land, Lily Briscoe, a young woman artist for whom Mrs. Ramsay was hoping to be a matchmaker, decides to begin work again on an unfinished portrait of Mrs. Ramsay, and as she works, she also realizes a new kind of freedom for herself.<br /><br />Taking a modernist approach, Woolf has no primary narrator, instead slipping in and out of the minds of several characters as they think about life and observe life around them.  Her modified stream-of-consciousness allows her to create a vibrant, free-flowing atmosphere which she peoples with unique characters who have revealed their innermost thoughts.  The overall effect is powerful, and Woolf's often lyrical prose conveys the sights and sounds of life on the island at the same time that it also enlivens the highly philosophical but very personal portrait of family life.  No unifying plot and no unifying voice tie the three sections of the novel together, and many of the early characters play little role in the ending, yet in her hands the novel \\"works.\\"  Woolf captures not only the passage of time but also the effects of time on all of her characters as they continue their lives, however changed, following in the footsteps of experimental writers like James Joyce, and taking literary chances which place her work with the best of the twentieth century.

B002ONC9NC|5.0|The title of Lone Scherfig's An Education refers not to the academic education that sixteen year old Jenny (Carey Mulligan) is expected to achieve, not to mention her scholarship to oxford, but rather the life education that she receives and experiences through her romantic infatuation with 35 year old David (Peter Sarsgaard), as well as the lessons that she learns about herself and her own naivety.     The year is 1961, and Jenny is a girl who is full of life and is interested in music, French culture, and essentially living life to the fullest. She wants to go to Paris, and to experience romance and possibility. Her parents, Jack and Marjorie, played by Alfred Molina and Cara Seymour, are loving, doting people who only want the best for their daughter. They worry mostly about her financial and domestic security, which David seems very willing to offer her.    Jenny is almost immediately wooed by David's silver tongue and charm, although I'm not sure if she is necessarily moved by him as much as the idea of him allowing her and encouraging her to spread her wings and fly. She has the opportunity to abandon her schooling, and her future at Oxford for a life of romance, Parisian living, freedom from the rules and regulations of her life at home, and for whatever else a life with David comes with. But is the cost of losing an education really something worth gambling over? Is the life that Jenny so dearly dreams of and desires all it seems to be?     Is David really what he seems to be? Is he honest and true, loyal and compassionate and perfect? Of course he is not, and that is the point. He is 35, she is 16. He is very interested in sex with her, and eventually she is deeply interested in sex with him, but this is not the foundation of their infatuation. There is something more, but the level at which it would become a full-time, working relationship is just out of reach. Sarsgaard plays David so cunning and so debonair that I lost sight of the character's sleazinessat times, and the disturbing, somewhat sinister nature of the relationship itself.    The screenplay, by Nick Hornby, whose novel About a Boy was made into a brilliant film by the Weitz brothers in 2002, is very tender and smart, but I felt the final sequences were a bit contrived. I won't go to into detail, but let's just say that sometimes a clean resolution is not what a story like this calls for. I wanted a bit more, and then it was over, and some of the less explained parts of David's life were sort of wished away. Although this did prove a bit distracting, some of the moments leading up to the finale were brilliantly acted by Alfred Molina and Emma Thompson, who both are delightful to watch in this film. Molina has a golden way with words, in which he turns every line into a father's plea for his daughter to understand his point of view, and where he is truly coming from. Thompson also proves to be very convincing as the Headmistress of Jenny's school, who doesn't seem to care very deeply about Jenny's future.    I think that this film is almost completely carried on Carey Mulligan's back, and she has a great talent as a young actress: she manages to play a likable, even lovable, teenaged girl who is anything but perfect and lives through her own flaws. I think that all of the recent comparisons to Audrey Hepburn are spot on, and that her oscar nomination is looming around the corner. She is so believable and convincing in this part, and she is quite literally the heart and soul of nearly every single scene she is in, even, and sometimes especially, when she is not saying a word, but simply changing her expression a certain way, or staring in wonder at the world that surrounds her.
B000BBOV8U|4.0|Before I was a fan and knew a lot about Bryan's music, I used to have this song I taped from the radio but it was only a beginning riff.  This was way before Google, Amazon, and other pay download sites.  Imagine a 13 year old walking into a record store with his Walkman asking them to listen to this 6 second guitar riff.  The song was \\"This Time\\".  And since then i've been a fan of Bryan Adams.    As far as the collection, I do really like the fact that they finally released a 2 disc set of ALL (and so i thought) of his best songs.  The great songs are on here (\\"This Time\\", \\"Summer of '69\\", \\"Everything I Do\\", \\"All For Love\\" - from Three Musketeers, etc.) are all here.  And for around $15 with free shipping it's definitely not a bad deal.      That being said I can't give the collection 5 stars because of the omission of a few songs.  \\"Do I Have To Say The Words\\" which is a great ballad is not on here.  It appears on the \\"So Far So Good\\" compilation but not on an Anthology?  There were also 2 Holiday songs recorded by Bryan Adams on a double-sided 45 record.  They were \\"Christmas Time\\" and \\"Reggae Christmas\\".  \\"There Will Never Be Another Tonight\\" (great song but barely a hit) made this comp but \\"Do I Have To Say The Words\\" didn't?      All in all, this is a great compilation and I would recommend it to any fan of Bryan Adams or even those looking to discover his music.  But As a DJ and collector, I like all of the best songs on 1 CD/Anthology which is why I can't give this 5 stars though I would really like to.
0007263678|3.0|This is a well-written survey of Churchill's role during World War Two. But there are few revelations in it. On 24 May 1945, Churchill ordered his Chiefs of Staff to draw up a plan for an Anglo-American attack on the Soviet Union, `Operation Unthinkable', using 45 divisions and any remaining Wehrmacht forces.<br />Hastings points out, \\"Since the Western Allies decreed the governance of territories which they occupied, the Soviet Union considered itself entitled to do likewise in its own conquests.\\"<br />He reluctantly judges that of Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin, \\"it is hard to dispute the Soviet warlord's superior claim to be called the architect of victory.\\"

B001GM28HO|5.0|when lady gaga first came out, I thought she would have 1 or 2 top 10 songs and no one would remember her a year later, once Bad Romance came out, and the Fame was still in the top 20, after a full year, I had to buy it myself (I actually own the Chinese edition of the CD) The entire album is great, its one of very few albums I can listen to without having to skip half the songs. \\"I like it Rough\\" is my favorite song on the album, I personally think its better than all of her songs that made it to #1. The Chinese version of the album includes an extra track, \\"Disco Heaven\\", my second favorite song on the album.  There are really no bad songs on the album, besides Brown Eyes, the only piano song on the album.
B002ZG9788|1.0|I have never seen such a disregard for the original material before this movie. Everything that made the original film so epic (The love story, the depth of the characters, the underhandedness among the Gods) was not as in depth and seemed shallow is this telling, and at times ever backhanded. The use of key elements were not uses to the fullest, and others seemed to even be changed for spite.<br /><br />Where is the teacher of Perseus, Bubo was thrown to the side like trash, the Kraken looked like something out of a Spawn comic (not to say that's bad, it just didn't fit this film), the scorpions being tamed was retarded not to mention the fight sequences in that part seemed like the choreography was not very fluint and the blood came from Madusa not Calibos! Calibos wasn't even as devious as he should have been! Don't even get me started on why they put Hades in the film and I felt Zues did seem to have the \\"I am all there is\\" feel and I don't blame that on Liam  that's the writing.<br /><br />Now the parts I liked, The witches were fine except for the way they did the eye, however it's livable. The Roman soldiers were fine because there was a build to befriending Perseus. Pegusas was fine, I just wish Pegusas was in the film more.<br /><br />How this movie could have saved this film. Being more true to the original film. Add a half our, and make it less Lord of the Rings meets Scorpion King and it would have been a more cohesive film. Money I'll never get back, and thats why I won't the DVD or Blu-Ray! Don't waste your hard erned money on this travisty! If it were called \\"The Adventures of Perseus\\" things might have been different.
0385523386|5.0|Yes, it was a \\"minimum security\\" prison, and yes she's a middle class white girl who went to an Ivy League school ... so get over it. This is a book full of unexpected pleasures and insights. There's Kerman's unwavering capacity to value the women she meets. The vulnerability and sweetness she discovers beneath their surface bravado. The ingenious ways these women find to keep hope alive while facing years more of confinement.  The window their experience provides into the extraordinary differences between men and women (I'll take women).  Kerman finds a way to embrace the world she's living in, and then, in this book, a graceful blend of empathy and objectivity to bring alive a world she could never have imagined herself inhabiting.

1581806574|3.0|I had picked up this book awhile back and I had to say, it really was a great tool for the starting stages of drawing. The main things I really used in this book were the section with the skeletal & muscle structure and the wing section.<br /><br />The main thing I was a bit disappointed in was the fact that it really doesn't go into a whole lot of detail on certain sections such as head. There was too much in which it felt like those kiddy drawing books where you really didn't learn much other than to trace. It feels like this book would be geared towards younger preteen artists than those wanting to heavily study in it.<br /><br />If you already have some knowledge in basic structure of a dragon, I wouldn't really recommend this book.

Boy was I wrong, me and my family could not believe it when it was over.. what a waste of time.    After viewing this you have to laugh at Oscar awards now.. what a joke.   Worthless award if movies like this win.  Wasn't the director banned from the awards for violating their policy too?  But yet the movie still won?
B002TVQ4H6|5.0|Okay, this is a biased review as some of my footage was used in this movie. But I must say, the story is a twisted one and throws a hefty curve ball at you in the end.

This is a mind bender along the lines of \\"No Way Out\\" where the story drops a bombshell at the very end. [[ASIN:B002TVQ4H6 Triangle - Lenticular Packaging]]
345387336X|5.0|\\"The worlds through which Philip Dick's characters move are subject to cancellation or revision without notice,\\" sci-fi great Roger Zelazny once wrote, and it strikes me that Dick's \\"Ubik\\" is a perfect example of that statement. The author's 25th science fiction novel since 1955 (!), \\"Ubik\\" was originally released as a Doubleday hardcover, with a cover price of $4.50, in May 1969. It finds Dick giving his favorite theme--the mutability of reality--a thorough workout in a wonderfully well-written, at times humorous, increasingly bizarre story. Indeed, the book may be Dick's \\"spaciest\\" outing since 1964's \\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,\\" and had me wishing that I had originally read it back in my college days, while under the influence of some, uh, psychotropic substance!        In the book, the reader makes the acquaintance of the various members of Runciter Associates, run by Glen Runciter and his half-dead wife, who is able to give business advice although in cryogenic \\"cold pac\\" in a Swiss \\"moratorium.\\" Runciter Associates is comprised of special individuals who almost come off like very unusual members of the X-Men, except that these individuals, rather than commanding superpowers, possess what must be called antipowers; that is, they can cancel out the fields put forth by telepaths, clairvoyants, telekineticists and so on. During a promisingly lucrative business venture on the moon, Runciter, his assistant Joe Chip, and 11 of the various antitalents are ambushed in an explosion, orchestrated by Glen's enemies. Runciter himself is gravely injured and put into cold-pac storage, while the other team members scramble to find out how this attack transpired. But wait...why does reality itself seem to be changing? And why are various objects reverting to earlier forms, such as a modern (1992) stereo in Joe's apartment suddenly morphing into a Victrola? And how is it that everyone suddenly seems to be living in the year 1939, while one by one the team members crumble to dust? And just what is up with Ubik, a miraculous spray can that seems to be their only ticket to salvation? Dick certainly had his imagination working on overtime when he plotted out this one, that's for sure, and the wonder of it all is that, ultimately, the story DOES hang together coherently and ingeniously. It is a bravura piece of work, and one that \\"Time\\" magazine chose for inclusion in its \\"Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century\\" article. No argument from me!        \\"Ubik\\" really is a consistent pleasure to read. The aforementioned humor pops up in many guises, from throwaway remarks (such as a reference to a Supreme Court ruling to the effect that a man can murder his wife if he can prove that she would never grant him a divorce; the five-times-married Dick giving vent to some pleasant daydreaming, perhaps?) to hilarious turns of phrase (a man is said to be wearing a dress \\"the color of a baboon's ass\\") and to the truly outlandish outfits that all the characters wear (the moratorium owner sports a \\"tweed toga, loafers, crimson sash and a purple airplane-propeller beanie\\"). As in so many of Dick's other novels, amphetamine and LSD use are spotlighted, and the author's empathy for the plight of his characters is strongly pronounced. Dick also gets to show off his knowledge of 1930s minutiae in this tale, whether from in-depth research or by dint of having been an 11-year-old himself in 1939 America. His details are not ALWAYS spot on, however; a 1939 issue of \\"Liberty\\" magazine is said to contain a famous story entitled \\"Lightning in the Night,\\" although that story actually appeared in the August 1940 issue; the Ford tri-motor plane is said to have come into existence in 1928, whereas 1925 would be closer to the mark. Still, these are the merest quibbles. \\"Ubik\\" is basically an extraordinarily clever, mind-blowing entertainment. It may cause some to furrow their brow in bewilderment--\\"very confusing,\\" Joe Chip thinks to himself at one point--but I can'timagine anyone not being bowled over by this amazing piece of work. It is, quite simply, Philip K. Dick at his best, and modern-day science fiction doesn't get too much better than that.

0553208845|4.0|While working on a project about Buddhism for my ninth grade humanities class, we also had to read a free choice book.  So I decided to read a book that had to do with the religion I was studying.  I originally picked Siddhartha because of its small size but it wasn't long after starting the book that it really sparked my interest.  After having studyed Buddhism, Siddhartha gave me a better understanding and different perspective of the man credited with the creation of Buddhism.<br /><br />  The story starts out with young Siddhartha growing up as a very intelligent and high achieving student growing up in Nepal, India.  He is expected to become a priest.  He quickly learns everything that he wants to learn and decides that the love of his family and friends could not always satisfy him.  So, he leaves them behind and ventures into the forest to seek more knowledge with his very close friend Govinda.  He becomes very skinny with long nails and gives his clothes away.<br /><br />  On they're journey they come across the Buddha.  Govinda requests to become a follower of the Buddha and is accepted.  Siddhartha however, decides that the Buddha can't teach him anything that he doesn't know already and leaves his friend behind.  Siddhartha decides that he no longer wants to listen to other's teachings and just wants to learn from himself.  After talking with the Buddha about his hour of enlightenment, Siddhartha decides to set out to find it too.  He meets a woman named Kamala who he spends a lot of time with learning the art of love.  He also describes his three powers: thinking, waiting and fasting.  He then went to meet a merchant named Kamaswami.  The merchant lets him stay in his house, has him served three meals a day and gives him fancy clothes.  He learns a lot from the merchant.  But the merchant didn't quite understand Siddhartha's way of doing business. One example of this was once when he was going to get rice but another merchant got it first, instead of coming right back Siddhartha stayed in the village and helped some of the farmers.<br /><br />  After a while Siddhartha gets his own house with a big garden and his own servants.  He slept with many women and was all about his money.  He stops giving his money to the poor and starts betting it all on dice.  But this all ends when he has a dream about himself getting rid of all that it good in his life.  He realizes that being rich has filled his heart with misery and that he hasn't been truly happy living in Kamaswami's world.  So he abandons his house and the merchant.  He falls in to a great depression and feels like he's not a good person and realized that he's lost his three powers.  So he jumps into a river attempting to end his life. He wakes up, he is under a coconut tree and hears the river saying \\"Om.\\"  There he meets his friend Govinda, who is now a monk.  He explains to his friend how he has been a merchant, dice player, drinker and a poor man.<br /><br />  He then meets a rower who had once rowed him across the lake earlier in the book and askes to become his apprentice.  The rower accepts and lets Siddhartha stay with him.  The rower teaches him about how the river can speak and knows everything and can speak in any voice.  When it speaks in all the voices at the same time it forms the word \\"Om.\\"  Then while the Buddhists are having a ceremony for the Buddha who is dying, Kamala gets bitten by a snake while making her way to the ceremony.  Just before she dies she tells Siddhartha that the boy she brought along with her is his son.  Siddhartha takes care of him for a while but the boy wasn't connecting with him and eventually ran away.  The rower convinces him not to go after his son and just let him be.<br /><br />  At the end of the book the river shows Siddhartha his destiny.  Siddhartha realizes that every living object will die and be reborn into another thing.  He also realizes that everything has the chance to become a Buddha.  He decides that he loves everything.  He askes his friend Govinda to kiss his forehead and Govinda realizes that Siddhartha has become the Buddha.<br /><br />  Overall I thought the book was really interesting!  I would recommend this book to someone who is interested in Buddhism, or someone who is studying Buddhism.  I think it makes the book alot more interesting that way.  I also think that it might be hard to understand if you don't know anything about Buddhism.  My favorite thing about the book was how it gives a good sense of Siddhartha's personality.  One thing I thought was hard to understand was the last pages of the book.  Therefore,  Siddhartha wasn't only interesting but it was quite enjoyable to read.kes his friend Govinda to kiss his forehead and Govinda realizes that Siddhartha has become the Buddha.

But, it was all the things I had heard about, but wanted to pretend didn't happen. Well guess what...it happens!    So dig up that manacured lawn in your backyard and put in an organice garden.

B002LLE3PY|5.0|It's amazing how the sound was improved in the new mix. Some of the songs (Lady of the danzing water, for example) are completely renewed. Compared with the 30th aniversary edition, this it's like switch from a LP to a DVD.<br />I can't even wait for Islands!!!!
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is a different sort of Disney princess movie.  Oh, all the iconic trappings are here:  \\"wishing upon a star\\", \\"the handsome prince\\", \\"a fairy godmother\\", \\"an ugly stepsister,\\" \\"an evil villain\\", and \\"a Cinderella-like princess\\".  But this time, Disney digs a little deeper, taking these icons to newer, more modern, stronger heights.  In THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, \\"wishing upon a star\\" AND hard work make dreams come true, \\"the handsome prince\\" is a bit of a scallywag, \\"the fairy godmother\\" is a Bayou voodoo queen, \\"the ugly stepsister\\" is a bit shallow, but also beautiful, warm, caring, and the best friend of \\"the princess, \\"the evil villain\\" is a down on his luck voodoo huckster, and \\"the Cinderella-like princess\\" is a waitress who works too hard and has forgotten how to have fun.<br /><br />THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is not your standard the-prince-saves-the-princess-and-they-all-live-happily-ever-after fairytale.  Rather, it is a story of the prince and the princess working together to solve their problems, each complementing the other, and helping each other to grow.  The choices are hard and not always clear.  This princess is very strong and capable; she works hard for her dreams, but still learns to risk wishing upon the star.  What a wonderful new role model!  And along the way, she has her family and friends to lean on.<br /><br />I have already watched THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG twice with my nearly 5 year old daughter, and she has declared the evil villain \\"not scary.\\"  The scenes involving \\"the shadow man\\" are a little dark, but at the same time they are vivid and colorful.  They are also a bit vague, which detracts from their scariness.  (If you aren't paying attention, you will miss things.  Which may be how Disney planned it.)  Overall, I would put those scenes at the same scary-level as the \\"Heffalumps and Woozles\\" song from Winnie the Pooh.<br /><br />And let's not forget the wonderful music from THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG.  Again, Disney has gone in a completely different direction from its norm.  THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is set in New Orleans, and the music is everything you can imagine it should be:  jazzy, bright, bold, and bouncy with a Cajun spice.  Toe tappin' and head boppin'!  What a great change of pace!  Also of note is the fact that THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is hand-drawn like the original Disney animated movies.  And I must say it is quite a vibrant and lovely masterpiece.  Computers are NOT always better!<br /><br />My entire family really is really enjoying THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG (even my nearly 13 year old).  I anticipate many more viewings in the weeks to come.  Quirky, unique, and a little bit odd-ball, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG.  I think this movie will surprise you.  It sure surprised me.a completely different direction from its norm.

B001DJLD1M|3.0|This omnibus puts all four Matrix movies on two double-sided discs in one snap case, for only the cost of a single DVD at most discount stores.  That's at least a couple of evenings' viewing, and is probably good if you and your friends want to have a chat-and-chew film circle.  Though the movies could charitably be called hit-or-miss in their consistency and quality, this collection at least makes them all available at low cost.<br /><br />But this collection is cheaply done, with no special features, and the laminate surface only loosely glued down.  Unless you handle the discs with latex gloves and keep them in their case like precious jewels, they will have a short shelf life.  Perhaps that's not a problem if you only want to watch the films a time or two, but if you want to add them to your permanent collection, that can be a pretty serious drawback.<br /><br />These DVDs are best suited for a collection meant for kids' parties, dorm rooms, and private film club viewings.  They're not durable enough for your archive, and not broad enough for film buffs who like commentaries and featurettes.  If you want to space out in front of a hip sci-fi movie, get this DVD.  If you hope to reclaim the grandeur you felt when you first saw The Matrix, get a proper DVD.

I'd been looking for Cool Runnings in stores in my area and could not find it so I turned to good ol' Amazon and they pulled through.    Cool Runnings is based on the true story of a bobsled team made up of Jamaicans. It goes through how they decided to form a team, through the prejudices they faced and how they overcame the trials they encountered.    It's an all around fun movie that I highly recommend.
156224003X|3.0|Great, but watch out for negative programming.<br />While I highly recommend this book, I would caution you about what I perceive as blunders during the guided meditations.<br /> I believe Mr Werner intentions are honest and that that he lays down an excellent plan<br />for any musicians. (Jazz or not, by the way. Yes Mr Werner  speak of Jazz greats, but the principles discussed here can apply to any music or even art form, for that matter). The\\" talk \\"parts of the book are excellent, dissecting the various dysfunctions that hold so many musicians in there practice, relationship with the Self, the Ego. This book can really make a difference setting up a fresh new perspective  and work ethic to propel you and your Music to new heights.<br />However, and this breaks my heart because I really wanted to give this 5 stars, what I consider  blunders in the actual guided meditations:<br />As you might know, the mind and the subconscious only work with positives:<br />I mean DO NOT picture a pink elephant...What shows up? a pink elephant.<br /> Tell a kid don' t eat the cookies, and you just gave the kid the idea of eating the cookies.<br />Instead:  Picture a gray elephant, and let's keep the cookies for desert.<br />This is a basic  Neuro-linguistic reprogramming/ hypnosis/ Affirmation/ Buddhist Intention/ what ever you call it,  the mind works better with positives than negatives.  It is a basic fact that I wish would have been acknowledged before the printing of this book.<br />If you \\"tell you subconscious\\" the music you play is  ...NOT JAZZ,  jazz will show up.<br />If you \\"tell you subconscious\\"  I don' t need to prove that I am great\\"  proving that I am great shows up...<br />In one meditation, another blunder (p 93): After a few relaxing, closed eyes moment you hear:<br />\\"Let this moment be a holiday from perpetual discomfort.\\" Hello?! That statement implies that I was and will be in \\"perpetual discomfort\\", before and after the meditation!. That one really aggravated me.  Further, in that same guided meditation, after a very relaxing sentence, Mr Werner enumerate a list of fears:' fear of people...of playing...of sounding bad...of not surviving..of not being well thought of...\\"  Talk about relaxing. It made me conceptualize fears I did not have. I believe this is fine during the speech part but not during the meditation part.<br /> When you guide trusting people, and yourself,  to a journey within with your words, your words need to be fool proof. Don't take my word for it , and see what your research will yield. Speaking of research, Mr Werner quotes various inspiring books well worth reading as well, so thank you for that.<br />So I still  recommend the book, but rewrite and re record the CD with all positives, and, while you are at it, a more tailored fashion.after a very relaxing sentence, Mr Werner enumerate a list of fears:' fear of people...of playing...of sounding bad...of not surviving..of not being well thought of...\\"  Talk about relaxing.

0307463745|3.0|A little heavy on the platitudes, large type and line art and not very dense with information.

B000U1ZV44|3.0|Gothika is a thriller starring Halle Barry and Robert Downey Jr.. This is a review of the Blu-ray edition.    The story: **  We are introduced to the renowned psychiatrist Miranda Grey (Halle Berry) who is married to the head of the psychiatric hospital. One night she is driving home and almost hits a woman standing in the middle of the road and next she wakes up in one of the cells at the hospital finding she has killed her husband.  The basic idea of the movie is good. I think most people have feared that everyone would suddenly stop believing you and think you are crazy. But the movie doesn't really deliver; it seems to be mixed between trying to explain everything logically and using supernatural explanations and you end up feeling something is missing.    Picture: ****  A very nice transfer, which I have nothing to complain about. The movie is very dark so a display with a high contrast ratio is required.    Sound: *****  The disc contains uncompressed audio tracks and in general the soundtrack is very suspenseful. There is a lot of action in the rear speakers so you really feel surrounded. However the center speaker was a bit low, but that could be my setup.  Special features: ***  Nothing really special here: The obligatory director's commentary and some featurettes.    All in all: ***  The Blu-ray edition is very nice, but the film itself is just too bad. If you want a thriller like this I would definitely recommend buying [[ASIN:B0028RABSE The Others (2001) [Blu-ray]]] or the [[ASIN:B001BRZ5J2 The Sixth Sense [Blu-ray]]].
B002RAREAK|2.0|Usher longs to be put into three boxes as a artist.<br /><br />he wants to be seen as serious as the title this is his version of Marvin Gaye's \\"Hear, my dear\\"  Usher wants to come across more serious than the material leads on. it never works.<br /><br />he wants to be the multi all around artist of a Sammy Davis Jr again he is real polished but the theater of stage isn't on record.<br /><br />He wants to be as versitle as Michael Jackson whom he has long been chasing and emulating and as always he comes up real short.<br /><br />this record sounds like a typical modern day R&B/pop record and there lies the Problem. for him to ever be taken into that next light he has to step out of the usual and take some chances. I've always said do some real songs and leave the grooves and beats to the younger cats. he is coming across run of the mill as to the SuperStar that is portrayed to be.<br /><br />nothing on here is neither what I'd call good or great and then again it isn't horrible or the weakest,but it falls into the category of just sorta there to me.<br /><br />his range is far better than the material he gets stuck with. some nice moments and alot of been there and done much,much better.

0143038583|5.0|Excellent book.  Opens your eyes to all the unatural food we eat.  Good guide to what you put in your stomach.    Makes reader more aware of how and what to find in labels that fools us  with words that really mean the same thing.  I haven't finished the book yet. I already highly recommend it.  Good companion to \\"Food Inc.\\"

B002RAREAK|2.0|He said boobies in a song. Are you serious? BOOBIES? Usher you are like 32 what are you doing. After I heard this, I threw the headphones down. This doesn't make any sense. The songs are all made for someone who is 21 and under. I understand that he feels like he needs get his \\"swagger back\\", but this is just awful. His last album was probably too mature, so he thought he would take it back...all the way back. to like 3rd grade. \\"Your booty's like pow pow pow. o o o your boobies like oh oh oh\\" What in the world?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a waste of a talent!! So disappointed. His voice is so so beautiful. He just wastes it on stupid music.
B0000931OG|5.0|Despite AllMusics glaring 2 out 5 stars review Blur's 2003 effort has a unique appeal and should not be dismissed as a Damon Albarn side project. Think Tank relies heavily on electronic beats and looped samples in place of Graham Coxon's departure from the group. Similar to the way Radiohead experimented with Kid A, Blur have taken a similar path incorporating a variety of electronic, break beat and world influences to create a concept album that takes the listener back to the world of Parklife and discovers that it has turned into a dark desolate wasteland. Songs like \\"On the Way to the Club\\" describe a desperate attempt at romance at the club late at night. Not every track on Think Tank is gloomy, there is the \\"Song 2\\" soundalike \\"Crazy Beat\\" which has a catchy punky-dance riff with equally cheesy lyrics.  The following track \\"Good Song\\" is lite mid-tempo ballad about a simple country romance. Then there are the tracks which seem to lash out at the club scene such as `Brothers and Sisters\\" and the hidden track \\"Me White Noise\\". Think Tank demonstrates Blur's capacity to expand their sound to keep producing excellent albums, something that their arch rivals Oasis were never able to master. For fans of Gorillaz, Think Tank is the ideal album to start discovering the fantastic band that is Blur.  For already established Blur fans, there are definitely times where you can hear that Graham is missing, but where Graham's catchy hooks would fill in, Damon, Alex and Dave make up for in atmosphere.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|If you have never watched Desperate Housewives, you have really missed out on a treat and season 5 did not disappoint. Some of the seasons are better than others but season 5 is a must see!!! As usual, it's funny, dramatic, suspenseful and real.
B0030Y11XS|2.0|You should be clearly informed before buying that DVD ( not just\\"one of the ordered films may have an area code\\") that it´s no use ordering that film in a European country, as the area code prevents the film from being watched.
0316017922|5.0|This is a another great book by Malcolm Gladwell.  I saw him speak in the past and really like his way of thinking.  While there are extraordinary factors that make people successful, luck, timing and practice play a big part.  I enjoy his style for its simplicity.  It makes for a fun and interesting read and most importantly makes you think.
0805091742|3.0|\\"The Checklist Manifesto\\" is a good book, but if you're looking for guidance on creation and use of checklists, look elsewhere.  The author does provide many detailed stories about the implementation of checklists in the medical arena, but not so much in general business.
B0026S1XDM|5.0|I've had this set for about 6 playbacks now..3 days. Disc 1 is the  \\"remastered\\" version.  Sounds wonderful.  I haven't bothered to listen to the disc 2, the original version. Why?  \\"Please put the original on, I want to hear the primitive technologies defects.\\"  The DVD disc with 5.1?  I don't do 5.1.<br />I love this recording.  I'm glad they reissued it.  I do wish they had done a SACD Stereo and multichannel hybrid with the original version on Disc 2. I understand the DVD 5.1 version to reach those that have gone over to DVD multichannel.<br />I guess we will never know how good an SACD version would have been.  Oh well, the remastered one is still pretty darn good.<br />The booklet that comes with this is extensive and interesting reading.
1400063515|4.0|The Black Swan was an interesting an thought provoking read.  While at times, the author gets a tad too academic, his points are helpful in preparing for the unexpected.  I particularly liked his opinion on reading print media and economic forecasting.  Too often we relay on various sources for information that can be misleading and/or inaccurate.  I also liked his opinion on how to take advantage of opportunities. You never can time things correctly, thus you need to move quickly when they arise.  His writing is a a little too academic which unfortunately takes some getting used to.  I do think there is a lot to learn here and would encourage people to read the book.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|If everyone that views this movie does so with the intention of the makers, it will be enjoyed for what it is. An excellent motion picture, full of action and perhaps a little look into the future as what COULD happen, not what will. I truly enjoyed it when I rented it that I had to own it to view whenever I pleased.

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I have several SB-800s and SB-600 so my primary basis for comparison is against those.  Basically this strobe is excellent but some of the whistles and bells are of questionable utility.    The things I really like about the strobe are pretty much the things that make the SB-800 great.    - Remote capability via CLS system  - Su-4 slave mode  - External high voltage battery pack compatibility (plug on front)  - Nice guide numbers for a battery unit.  - Zoom that can be controlled manually or by the camera.  - Selectable beep for when unit has recycled.  - Can be used as a three channel master for Nikon's CLS system    The things this unit does that are improvements compared to the SB600 and SB800 that I like and what motivated me to purchase it are:  - Zoom to 200mm and not just 85 mm (600) or 105 mm (sb800).  - Different beam patterns  - Head rotates a full 180 degrees in both directions (requires a little surgery on an SB800 to fix this stupid problem on them)  - Manual thumb switch for on/off and selecting remote and master modes instead of the slow menu system.  These are what I wanted/liked and why I went for this strobe unit.    The things I don't like or question the value of them:  - I don't like the size.  It is bigger than the SB800 some of which admittedly is needed for the zoom optics for the lamp itself but the lower body is bigger too.  I can open SB800/600s straight out and stand them upright in a Think Tank camera pack but the 900 has to be folded 90 degrees and/or laid down and it takes up much more space.  - The colored gel thing to automatically set the white balance with the camera is something I don't care for.  I suppose some folks that want idiot-proof will like this but it is simply added cost with no benefit for most photographers who know enough to use gels.  Much of the time we specifically don't want the camera to change white balance to tungsten if we put a CTO gel on the strobe.  And the green gel to match the strobe to fluorescent lights is of little use because most fluorescent lights any more need more than just a green gel on the strobe to obtain an acceptable match.   Green alone is ok for old fluorescent lights but most lights now need a green, full CTO and often a bit of yellow as well to make a decent match.  So this feature adds cost but no value.  - I have a real grudge against the 900 because it allowed Nikon to discontinue the 800.  Bad move. I'll probably buy more 600s since you can get two of those for the price of one 900 and have more light to boot.  - I have mixed reaction to the modeling light.  I like that when you push the button it stays on for a couple seconds, kind of handy to let you use both hands for a brief moment to adjust things.  However, with the 800 there were dedicated buttons, one to operate the modelling feature (it strobes at a fast rate and lower output so you can see how the light hits your subjects) and one to just trip the flash.  The 900 has only one button and you have to select in the setup memu which function it will provide, flash or modelling light.  That kinds of sucks.  - The new Radio Poppers Jr Studio verson wireless triggers have a function and accessory (cube) that can provide manual control of the power for many TTL strobes.  A thing called a \\"cube\\" makes the connection but electrically the 900 is different so it doesn't interface with the Radiopopper Jrs. like the 600 or 800 do. Sure the RadioPopper PX or older P1 system can provide manual control, sort of (its actually provided by the Nikon CLS), but the Jrs are less than half the price.  Probably not significant for most photographers, just something a few will miss.    Interestingly, the price of used SB800s are often, and most all old stock new ones are going for more than the new price for an SB900 so clearly the 900s aren't meeting some of the needs for many photographers.  That is probably mostly the size thing, but many Nikon photogs have a collection of 800s and there is value in having stuff be the same, expecially with assistants helping you.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Bloody brilliant. A true tale of pure greed and the test of friendship. Bogart was brilliant in his role of Dobbs. The two disc dvd is a great package and contains some great special features. The video quality is outstanding and looks great on dvd. This is one classic film you do not want to miss. We don't need no stinking badges!
B002N8A14M|5.0|For the price, a great product!  Nicely packaged.  What's really cool is the clear plastic shell case with full coverage of the whole ipod including the screen yet open to the click wheel --open at the top to get to the lock button, at the bottom to get to the headphone jack and the docking port for the USB cable, and it has a handy spring clip on the back to not only clip and attach to the armband but to use without the armband and clip to a pocket or waistband, etc. The armband is lightweight and expands from the tiniest wrist to the largest bicep with it's adjustable velcro connector.  Like most cases, you have to remove the bottom part of the shell to make adequate connection to any ipod docking station, but the shell separates easily with a click.  I got two - one for my husband's and my Ipod Nano 5th generation - mine is a 16GB, and his is an 8GB -- the shell fits like a glove.  I bought it mainly for the clip idea and full coverage protection, plus it's clear so that my bright orange nano still shows.  Would definitely recommend.  I received it after 5 days with free shipping and handling.
B00328G4V6|4.0|An excellent compilation from the legendary Jimi Hendrix, and a compilation it is, containing mostly unreleased unfinished demos and tracks. The recording does include interesting and different versions of \\"Fire\\" and \\"Stone Free\\". Hendrix then rips the intro on \\"Bleeding Heart\\" like his hero, the extraordinaire slide guitarist Elmore James. The surprise track on here is Cream's, \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\", the tune escapes into a whirlwind, done so in the traditional Hendrix fashion. Jimi Hendrix played the guitar so hard and ferocious, almost like a rapid fire machine gun, using his instrument like a technician or a potent weapon. Let's not forget the singing power of Jimi, probably underrated, Hendrix sang with intense clarity. One reviewer said of Hendrix, musicians nowadays have long surpassed his talents, there's one thing seriously wrong with that statement, Jimi Hendrix played from the heart and soul, and comparing to nowadays music mainstream that's known as a dying breed. \\"Valleys Of Neptune\\" supposedly the most rare sought out after Jimi Hendrix song is finally released, an excellent song, made perfectly for the legend. I've read a few negative reviews on this release, the one and only negative reason for me was the recording is advertised as a never before released brand new Hendrix album, these twelve recordings, 1969, are supposedly the intended sequel to \\"Electric Ladyland\\", and if they are, these songs are unfinished demos made into a compilation, actually this is one of the better Jimi Hendrix compilations I've heard, the reason I have to rate this four stars, minus one for the questionable advertising, anything for a buck. Remember, this is Jimi Hendrix, any opportunity to hear the man is golden, the Sony audio is superior.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|A thousand thanks to Disney for returning to animation. I am a 28 year old African American woman who is an unapologetic Disney fan.  I collected the classics - Little Mermaid, Beauty and Beast, The Lion King - and didn't care much for the digital animation.      As soon as I heard about this movie, I immediately started telling my friends and WE dragged our kids to the movie to see it. My daughter is 3 years old and WE watch it repeatedly. In fact, we went to the movies twice to see it.  Even my husband enjoyed it!    It's not your typical rags-to-riches story. I really like the fact the story line wasn't \\"the prince saves the princess\\" but rather \\"we worked together to solve the problem, and met some great friends along the way.\\"  It was a wonderful blend of dreaming and hard work, and the importance of friends, family, and love.  I loved the contrasts they used in this storyline - poor, rich, hard-working, idle, serious, fun-loving, black, white - so many tend to shy away from these issues.    I won't repeat what many of the viewers have already said, but this movie is so worth it.
B00127RAJY|4.0|For a few short workouts, these are amazing!  Each workout is intense and provides great muscle burn while making you drip sweat from every pore.      The ONLY downside to this DVD is that you can't skip through Jillians intro.  By day 3 I had enough of it and tried to skip through it only to discover that I was stuck listening to it every single day... Enough already!    I also wish that there were two workouts for each level so you could switch them up from day to day... doing the same exact workout routine every day for 2-3 weeks, while completely challanging, is just a little boring...
B003DRWX9I|4.0|Ever since I read in [[ASIN:0061351431 Slash's book]] that he planned to do a \\"Slash and Friends\\" record I looked forward to the day it happened. Well that day is here, albeit under a different title. \\"Slash and Friends\\" was kind of a corny name anyway; the self-titled Slash is much cooler. Although I wouldn't be surprised to see this record's name ultimately default to the little inscription on the cover that reads \\"R&FNR\\". In fact that's exactly how I will refer to it for the rest of this review.<br /><br />And R&FNR is certainly an apt title, because this is a great Rock and FN Roll record. You get a nice array of rock musicians combined with a nice array of rock vocalists to lift Slash to what I hope will be a big selling record for the guy. It goes without saying that Slash rips it up on every song. I dare say that R&FNR may be Slash's best recording since [[ASIN:B000000OQF Appetite for Destruction]]...okay, at least [[ASIN:B00020NPZA Contraband]].<br /><br />Slash is joined by many different players across the 14 tracks included on the Amazon MP3 release, including to name a few: most of his former GNR members (except Axl), Dave Grohl & supposedly Travis Barker (but darned if I can figure out or find info on exactly which song(s) it is that Barker is playing on). And on vocals, the guest appearances and songs sound like this:<br /><br />1. \\"Ghost\\" featuring Ian Astbury of The Cult. Great hard rocker to start the record.<br />2. \\"Crucify the Dead\\" with Ozzy. 'Slow & go' rocker with Taylor Hawkins of Foo Fighters banging the drums.<br />3. \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" featuring Fergie of Black Eyed Peas. That's right...Fergie!...and she rocks. Hey, I don't know if you had a chance to see her blow the doors off Madison Square Garden singing Gimme Shelter with Mick Jagger in the HBO televised 25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Concert in October 2009, but this pop singer can rock.<br />4. \\"Back from Cali\\" has Myles Kennedy from Alter Bridge. Good rock song. Myles has some pipes. Rumor is that Myles will be will be Slash's touring singer to promote R&FNR.<br />5. \\"Promise\\" with Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, but you get more of the Audioslave Cornell on R&FNR...a slowish rock groover.<br />6. \\"By the Sword\\" has Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother howling out a slow and heavy Zeppelinesque rocker.<br />7. \\"Gotten\\" Adam Levine of Maroon 5 croons through this somewhat of a ballad that picks up for a bit in the middle when Slash solos.<br />8. \\"Doctor Alibi\\" Lemmy Kilmister deliverers what you'd expect from the Moterhead vet...a punk influenced rocker.<br />9. \\"Watch This\\" features Dave Grohl back behind the drum kit & Duff McKagan on bass for a heavy instrumental worthy of the title that I'd really love to see the three of these guys do live. Slash lights up the album with some serious shredding.<br />10. \\"I Hold On\\" with Kid Rock doin' his country rock thing.<br />11. \\"Nothing to Say\\" M Shadows from Avenged Sevenfold joins Slash for perhaps the heaviest track on the recording. A good hard rock tune, and the A7X influence is loud and clear.<br />12. \\"Starlight\\" Myles Kennedy is back for another track with a bluesy rock vibe. Kennedy can really sing.<br />13. \\"Saint is a Sinner Too\\" On this one a guy named Rocco DeLuca (who?) lays down the vocals for a ballady kinda tune with a slow marching beat in the background.<br />14. \\"We're All Gonna Die\\" Iggy Pop joins Slash on the last track for a foot stompin' party anthem that suggests, \\"We're all gonna die, so let's get high!\\"<br /><br />There are even more tracks available depending on what retailer or what country you buy the disk or download from (including guest appearances by Steven Adler, Flea, Cypress Hill & Alice Cooper). But the above is what you get from Amazon.<br /><br />R&FNR should, but probably won't, get enough airplay on the radio. Too many Rock radio stations these days (like Octane on Sirius) play cookie-cutter rock that for whatever reason have decided that songs with guitar solos aren't cool. This record defies that stupid theory and will hopefully help set an example for modern rock.<br /><br />So all in all is R&FNR a masterpiece? No, but it is a very good Rock record. Buy it now.an example for modern rock.    So all in all is R&FNR a masterpiece? No, but it is a very good Rock record. Buy it now.
B0032KNA4I|1.0|The blu-ray took more than 10 days to deliver, however, the slow delivery was not the worst part: the disk itself<br />took more than 45 minutes to load on my SONY blu-ray player. I was disappointed since my kids had waited the whole<br />Spring Break to see the \\"loading bar\\"...<br /><br />Hopefully I could play the movie before 2012.
B0000X61VE|5.0|When I first started doing these videos I knew they would be tough so I worked up to them with my own exercises like walking and doing the exercise bike.  Then I started out slowly by doing just the ten minute workout for a week.  After that I felt ready to do the longer ones but then only as many reps as I could handle.  After it ceased to be as challenging I increased the weights and concentrated more on slow control.   Yes, you will be sore, but never a bad sore.  I was so proud to feel that way--I knew I had had a good workout.  And the reason I knew I hadn't damaged myself is because I never hurt(as opposed to burn) when I did the exercises, and I always felt good when I was done.  Interestingly enough the more sore I was, the more necessary I felt it was to exercise again.  And doing that always made me feel better!  Kudos to all the five star reviews--you covered just about everything for me.  I was so upset about the editorial and was relieved to see that there were people out there who knew what they were talking about.
0061134007|5.0|If you like the Stieg Larsson books, you will probably like The Redbreast.  Larsson's trilogy is set in Sweden - The Redbreast is set in Oslo.  There is good character development, and the book provides some interesting insights into how Norwegians dealt with the German occupation during WW II.  The author uses some clever literary devices, and the stories (there are several that come together) move along quickly.  I think the translator went for British English - sometimes the usage and construction is a bit awkward for the American reader.  Very enjoyable.  I plan to read another of his books.

B0015ABRE2|4.0|The king of saran wrap and industrial strength garbage bags is back and has become ::coughs:: domesticated.?!?!     Dexter has found a kindred spirit it seems, a man after his own heart! Miguel Prado (wonderfully played by Jimmy Smits) enjoys the thrill of the hunt and kill as much as Dexter does. Just one problem, Miguel may like it a bit too much.  This makes him impulsive and reckless.  Miguel wants to do things HIS way.  He certainly doesn't want to follow Dexter's code.      Thus begins a wonderful cat and mouse game between these two BFFs.... Best Fiends Forever!!  How much can Dexter trust Miguel with his dark secrets?  How receptive is Miguel to receiving Dexter's instruction?  Just how much can he divulge to Prado without leaving himself exposed and vulnerable? The interaction between Dex and Miguel is fabulous.  These two killers play off each other very well.      And, speaking of breaking the rules, Dexter accidently breaks one of his own, taking the life of an \\"innocent\\".  Dexter also learns that Harry had dark secrets of his own that he kept very well hidden. Dexter's errand of mercy (the key lime pie) was very poignant and touching.  It gave us greater insight into showing how far his compassion for another could extend.     Debra is still the same ol' emotional basket case she's always been, and Masuka is still a raunchy sexist dawg (my absolute most favorite supporting character, plus he has some of the best lines in the show). Batista finds a bit of happiness.  Laguerta seems to have matured emotionally as a leader and found her niche this season.     Initially Rita was great as she was broken and emotionally damaged, thus she was the perfect girlfriend for Dex.  She didn't make too many demands of him.  In season two and three, she developed more of a backbone, but it seemed to turn her into a shrew and a harpy more than any thing else.  Heck, I'd see to it I had nocturnal hobbies that kept me out of the house too if I had to deal with her clingytirades!!  Dexter seems to chafe at the constraints.  Plus, by season's end, Dexter's getting married and we have a baby being thrown into the mix (usually a series killer right there)....Diaper Daddy Dexter! The picture of domestic bliss and tushy changing duty doesn't seem to fit our favorite serial killer.    I love this series, but I felt season three just didn't match up to that raw, thought provoking, tight, edge of your seat thrill ride we came to expect, and one for which I thoroughly enjoyed, in seasons one and two.  Season three missed that boat in delivering that same level of intensity.  Don't get me wrong, even watching a BAD episode of Dexter would be preferable to any other show out there, but overall, this season just seemed to be mildly disappointing and slightly lacking.  It wasn't as intellectually challenging to the viewer as seasons one and two.  Some story threads just dead ended without ever being fully explored. It was predictable.  The previous seasons definately kept the viewer on their toes and guessing.    Still, this series is the best thing out there and I will continue to watch Dexter evolve.    ~ jade ~

0385732554|5.0|I rarely write a review, but I also rarely encounter a book with such magnitude and power.  This is a great read and a quick page turner.  The plot, which is a simple one, involves Jonas, a young eleven year old boy trying to find out what he will become when he grows up (that choice is never allowed in the community that demands total control).  His is chosen to be a receiver and there is when the book becomes an utter page turner.    So what is this book about?  Its theme is choice and the consequences that we all face when making them.  Do we want a world that is without choice, but is completely safe, or do we risk choice and the potential negative consequences.  Clearly the ending offers a solution albeit it is a dark and poignant one and forces us to evaluate those ideas.  That's what great literature is about.  You are not slammed in the face with a neat solution but instead offered an ambiguous ending that asks the questions that need to be asked.     Clearly the book offers dark themes that many parents don't want their children exposed too, but are they better with Grand Theft Auto, media bombardment, and R rated horror films? This book actually demands that you question and think about situations that will affect everyone in life.  This is an extremely important piece of writing. Well done.

0060930349|3.0|I used this book in my class on US History up to 1865. Like any other history book on a nation this is an overview, many subjects will be skipped over but many will be touched upon as well. There is no such thing as a perfect history book and if there were it would be several volumes long. Johnson takes the history of the US and gives it a slightly religious treatment but in some aspects he takes a large step and creates a religious aspect. He labels the Revolution as a religious war. Even though I teach at a Christian college I do not share this view. He also gives the Native Americans little credit for being a strong people who actually saved early settlers time and time again. The early pages of the book are wasted on facts and figures that most students of history could skip without doing harm to their understanding of the subject. This is a book that is OK for a cursory view but if you are wanting a good strong analysis there should be three or four other books by your side.

B002ZFQD04|3.0|Madonna has really been loving releasing her tours on CD.  Fans have been clamoring for such ever since her Blond Ambition Tour, and boy, did she deliver.  Her last three shows have been recorded and released as an audio CD.  Her Re-Invention tour from 2004 was fun (the album is called I'm Going To Tell You A Secret, and it's amazing). The Confessions Tour in 2006 was flat-out OUTSTANDING, and is probably one of the best live albums I've ever heard.  Now we have the Sticky & Sweet Tour.  Ugh...this one completely misses the mark.    Speaking strictly about the audio portion on the CD, despite a handful of great moments, this CD absolutely cannot stand on its own without the accompanying visuals.  High-energy tracks such as \\"La Isla Bonita 2008\\" look great when you can see it (and having seen it live, it was a highlight of the show).  On the CD it sounds noisy and disheveled.  The same can be said of \\"She's Not Me\\", which is quite humorous on stage and just sounds silly if you're only listening to it.  The show's opening, \\"Candy Shop\\" lacks all of the punch and excitement of seeing Madonna emerge from behind the screens on her M-shaped throne.  \\"Beat Goes On\\" sounds exactly like the album version from Hard Candy and seems redundant without seeing Madonna rocking out on the car onstage.  If you managed to snag the iTunes special edition you'll be treated to cringe-worthy renditions of \\"Heartbeat\\" and \\"Borderline\\" as well.  Plus there's an overarching issue with the sound mixing.  It just doesn't sound as clear as Confessions Tour or I'm Going To Tell You A Secret.  Now there are songs that sound absolutely INCREDIBLE on the CD.  By far and away \\"Vogue 2008\\" is the best moment in this CD.  The song sounds fresh and invigorating when mashed up with \\"4 Minutes\\"!  Also noteworthy is the masterful, thumping version of \\"Like A Prayer\\" near the end of the album.    As far as the DVD goes, this is the saving grace of this collection.  This high-energy show is certainly not her best (Confessions and Drowned World take that honor), but Madonna certainly does not disappoint.  Unlike the past few tours, this one seems more raw and \\"live\\" which is perfect for a stadium show.  The audience here is 110% engaged in the show, and Madonna genuinely seems to be having a great time.  The setlist is a good mix of hits and songs from Hard Candy, though I wish she'd included a song or two more from Ray of Light, Music or American Life in lieu of the new songs (Hard Candy is her weakest album by far).  Show highlights include the opening \\"Candy Shop\\", the rocked-out \\"Human Nature\\", \\"Vogue\\", \\"Into The Groove\\" (this needed to be on the CD), the haunting \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\", \\"You Must Love Me\\", \\"Like A Prayer\\" and the finale of \\"Give It 2 Me\\".  If there's one thing Madonna can do, it's put on a show, and the Sticky & Sweet Tour is definitely worth seeing!
0525421580|5.0|Will Grayson has been Tiny Cooper's best friend since elementary school. Tiny is, according to Will, \\"the world's largest person who is really, really gay\\" and constantly falling in and out of love--and dragging Will with him everywhere. When his latest attempt to hook Will up with a girl fails, Will meets Will Grayson, another teen who is depressed and discouraged. Both Wills make an effort not to feel too much in life, but are changed after meeting, and continue to change as Tiny puts on his extravagant and fabulous autobiographical musical, \\"Tiny Dancer\\", culminating in an unforgettable and powerful night.    John Green and David Levithan have created a very unique, surprising, and downright hilarious novel. The book is told in alternating chapters, and it's very easy to distinguish which point of view each author is writing from. Their characters are so different, but at the same time the book is very cohesive and engaging. Green's Will is a lot like some of his previous characters: funny, self-deprecating, and a bit nerdy and self conscious, but he is a terrific friend and an honest person. Levithan's Will is a bit darker. He is lonely and depressed, and it's evident throughout most of the book that he is hurting and doesn't know how to be himself, or even be happy. Each Will possesses his own authentic voice, and the chapters flow seamless together, playing off each other well with Tiny as a good (albeit a little self-centered) central character.    The plot is complex, and the change in each Will may be gradual as each one sorts out their own myriad of problems and issues, but the journey is funny, rough, and best of all, smart (for example, Schrondinger's cat is used as an extended metaphor throughout much of the book). Will Grayson, Will Grayson is brilliant and intelligent read about love, appreciation, and feeling with an unflinching and bold style that many teens will appreciate.    Cover Comments: I really like this cover! It is very fitting that sincethere is a musical in the book there is a spotlight on the cover, and the perspective is different. The font is also pretty cool--I like how some of the letters of the title run into each other. This is just a really excellent cover!
0061730327|2.0|I have read the book but one thing that kept poping in my mind is \\"was it really possible\\"?  Here is just one example:    He said he extracted a motor out of a radio than built his first generator but as far as i know a radio does not have a motor but a casette player. Lets assume it was a casette player and he got the motor but from that small motor you can not generate enough electricity to operate a radio. He said he added some blades and rotated manually and touch the wires to his tongue, it tickled. But if your motor is so small you need to spin it really really fast to get something out of it.     His end product may work fine but his book arises more questions that it answers. That reminds me \\"memoirs of a boy soldier\\", which turned out to be a hoax.     We need scientific check on the story and evidence beyond photographs on the expense of ruining a story of hope and courage.
0802798225|5.0|The Young Adult book market is rife with stories that incorporate paranormal elements. Such books are often exciting, suspenseful and capture the imagination of their readers. The trend in the market being what it is, can a teen book without supernatural elements stand a chance of intriguing an audience? I think it can. One such book is Perfect Chemistry by Simone Elkeles.    There are no boys turning into fantastical creatures in this book, but that doesn't make it any less of a great read. Perfect Chemistry is a 357 page YA novel that's romantic and edgy. The differences between Brittany Ellis and Alex Fuentes may not be otherworldly, but crossing the great divide between culture, race and class provide more than enough conflict and drama.      Alex is a Latino gang banger who gets paired with Brittany, the blond All-American cheerleader as partners in their chemistry class. At first, neither can see past the stereotypes they have of each other. It's a mutual hate-fest. They grow to learn that opposites attract and there are plenty of sparks and fireworks when they do!    This is a well written and exciting story. I couldn't put it down. There are some truly heart rendering and touching moments. I'm happy to say there is a sequel coming out on April 27, 2010 called the Laws of Attraction. I'm looking forward to it.    I emailed the author over the summer and was surprised to receive a fairly extensive reply in which she answered questions I had. This was greatly appreciated. Simone Elkeles is an author that obviously values her readership. Pick up this book. You will not be disappointed.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I ordered around 3/3/10 was giving a ship email around the next day, recived 3/28 someone could have walked it to my house from TN to MN faster then it got here, other than that happy with the movie.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Bullock was excellent. If she didn't win some kind of award for this, she should have. Sometimes, these \\"triumph-of-the-human-spirit\\" movies can be sappy and lame but this was great. Of course, the fact that it's a true story just makes it even better.    Highly recommended.
B0021L8UPS|3.0|Honestly, this had more of a psychological thriller feel to it, for me.<br /><br />There's some blood, a little vulgarity (and a little nuding up), but there isn't anything especially graphic OR intensely interesting about this flick. It's the same tired plot we've heard of the little orphan who gets adopted into a loving family and then all hell breaks loose. The problems are: A) It really isn't that loving of a family, in the first place, as they show. B) Some of the problems the parents are shown to have would most DEFINITELY be frowned upon by adoption agencies. None of this really matters, though, once Esther shows up. I must say, a magnificent performance by Isabelle Fuhrman. She is creepy and demented and the flick wraps itself around her. Unfortunately, some of the dialogue written for the other characters is poor, there are many plot holes, and the film is entirely too predictable. All the suspenseful moments AREN'T suspenseful! You know, the fridge door is open and when they go to close it, she should be standing there, staring? Yeah, but she isn't. It's trickery suspense and it's poorly done. I expected more from this film after all the hoopla that surrounded it - but I didn't get it.
B002IJ3CEM|3.0|I bought this through Amazon. The movie was awesome! Because I travel a lot I was not able to get my digital copy from the United States until recently. Unfortunately when I went to retrieve the digital copy of the Director's cut online I was given the wrong code. It also asked me to fill in mailing information to send me what I should already have. Am I upset a little for the price that I paid for this? Yes! Ensure that you have everything checked before the time to return an item! Now I have a movie and fancy plastic head holder with a digital copy that I can not watch.
B000784WMW|4.0|I gave this a 4 star rating only because it does a great job depicting the character from the novel very well. Jane and Mr Rochester moral characters are evident. The movie quality is lacking. There is a new version out that I really enjoyed as well but they left out Jane's God fearing moral standard the drove her life. I wish I could combine the 2 movies to make a perfect match. If you love the book then you will enjoy the movie just don't expect it to be high quality.
B0012GN0FI|5.0|Accept is without a doubt --as Nikola Tesla-- one of the greatest forgotten geniuses that did not get the recognition they deserved.    This is THE album, their masterpiece,  and in my oppinion it is so much better than any of their studio albums.  Not a bad song in the album, it is a whole trip with so much power and energy.     No live album that I can recall in ANY music genre is this good, period.
B000IONJJ2|5.0|I love this movie and as far as comedies go its a 10 out of 10 . Kevin Kline is fantastic and I dont think that this movie would be near as good without him . Kline really does steel the show but others such as Curtis , Cleese , and Palin are good also . I laughed from start to finish .

B00005MM01|5.0|One of the first pop two-disc box sets is now on one CD. The title refers to Donovan as the \\"prince of flower power\\", the \\"Garden\\" being his fans. A must for both young and old. Donovan wrote the liner notes (the first half of the disc's lyrics are very small, being copied from the LP sleeve. The \\"Songs For Little Ones\\" half begins with the wailing of Donovan's son (probably Donovan Leitch Jr. who was born around the time). Like many of his tunes they are simple and childlike. He even pays tribute to his mentor Derroll Adams in the last song \\"Epistle to Derroll\\".  It should be noticed there are many references to sea and aquatic life (a recurring Donovan theme) so this is the perfect album for a summer's day!
B002RSDW80|5.0|This is a definite feel good movie.I have always oved Julia Child and watched her when I was little with my dad who loves to ccok.Meryl Streep was amazing and Amy Adams a delight as always. Would highly recommend this movie.

071265254X|3.0|After all the victors' propaganda, it's interesting to read Hitler's actual words. From erudite consideration to all-out rant, it's an illuminating peek into his pre-war thought processes.    The linguistic style is convoluted and it does take some stamina to get through 628 pages.    This edition is marred by the editors sycophantic apologetic commentary.  The books stands by itself as an historic artefact; there was no need to apologise for publishing it.  Editors' time would have been better spent on explanatory and contextual notes.    I've not researched the original content enough to determine whether the translation was accurate or not.  Other reviewers believe it not to be, so you may want to consider another edition.
B0035J6TAI|4.0|If you've followed Peter and his career (and not just the SO album or that Shock the Monkey song) you know that whatever it is he does, it's not going to be predictable. I've been a fan of pretty much everything the man has touched... the guy to me is one of the most innovative artists/songwriters of the past 40 years. So I was very concerned that this would be a mistake (an album of cover songs that is). But of course a covers album by PG is not going to be what most people think of, when it comes to a covers album. In his monthly video blog, he mentioned that this album was going to be a love it or hate it type of release... and by the looks of these reviews, he was dead on! As some others have mentioned it is a very dark album, which has very little variation due to the starkness of just an orchestra and Peter's vocals. It's a bold experiment that given repeated listens surprisingly works for me and there are moments on the album that are breathtaking. Gabriel's voice just seems to get better and better with age. I scratch my head (pun intended) at some of these negative reviews based on Peter's vocals. Maybe it's because there are times when he lets a bit of rawness show through his delivery (this comes through on the Radiohead cover especially). With all that said, as a fan I can easily see other fans dissatisfaction with not having an album of newly written songs. I really hope Peter locks himself up and pens some new tunes soon.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|Slash finally puts out his first solo record. This album hits directly where I thought it would.  The general theme of the album is blaring rock and roll, nothing earth shattering . The album sounds like a compilation record. It doesn't really have a direction and doesn't feel like a single unified musical piece. Each song carries the feel from the featured singer's band, which is not entirely a bad thing since it gives some variety. If I had to rate this with Slash's other none Guns work,Id rate it above VR and just below Snakepit.Always liked both Snakepit albums.      Here's a little song by song.     1. Ghost - Good song. Nice opener. Izzy's influence is apparent and appreciated.     2. Crucify The Dead -  Ozzy,all that needs to be said    3. Beautiful Dangerous - Good vocals. Though the beginning lick sort of reminds me of Dr Feelgood.     4. Back from Cali - Myles has got lungs. Lucky, since he's going to be fronting Slash's upcoming tour. An anthem, but a good one.      5. Promise -  I wasn't sure what Chris Cornell to expect the screeching Soundgarden Cornell or the pansy Scream era Cornell. This isn't screeching. It is in fact quite soulful. However this time Chris is with a great guitarist so this venture into soulful territory works much better than any song on his solo album and it's a decent tune.     6. By The Sword - Embodies the album well.  A decent rock n roll song if nothing earth shatteringly awesome.     7. Gotten -  It's soft and the Maroon 5 sound is very prominent.     8. Dotor Alibi -It's Lemmy,so it's Motorhead.     9. Watch This -  Definitely one of the few stand out solo's of the record.     10. I Hold On - Nice radio friendly stuff with Kid Rock.      11. Nothing to Say -  Another anthem like song.     12. Starlight - Myles Kennedy becomes the only singer to appear twice on this record .     13. Saint Is A Sinner Too - Stands out from the rest of the album in just how different it is..     14. We're all Gonna Die - Iggy Pop - More anthemlike rock .      Should have been released with ALL songs-     1. Ghost (feat. Ian Astbury)   2. Crucify The Dead (feat. Ozzy Osbourne)   3. Beautiful Dangerous (feat. Fergie)   4. Back From Cali Listen   5. Promise (feat. Chris Cornell)   6. By The Sword (feat. Andrew Stockdale)   7. Gotten (feat. Adam Levine)   8. Doctor Alibi (feat. Lemmy Kilmister)   9. Watch This (feat. Dave Grohl & Duff McKagan)   10. I Hold On (feat. Kid Rock)   11. Nothing To Say (feat. M. Shadows)   12. Starlight (feat. Myles Kennedy)   13. Saint Is A Sinner Too (feat. Rocco DeLuca)   14. We're All Gonna Die (feat. Iggy Pop)   15. Sahara (feat. Koshi Inaba)   16. Paradise City (feat. Fergie & Cypress Hill)   17. Mother Maria (feat. Beth Hart)   18. Baby Can't Drive (feat. Alice Cooper & Nicole Scherzinger)
B002SJIO4A|3.0|District 9 is an exciting, though provoking film. It is delivered in the low tech environment of a typical South African city and ghetto town of our current time. The movie starts out a little quirky but picks up focus and direction well, and really gets going around 30% in.     HOWEVER, beware, that this is most definitely NOT an exploration of aliens, of humans reacting to aliens, of looking for aliens, bonding with aliens, exploring space or technology or anything like that. You realize very strongly soon after the movie starts that this is Hollywood routine again and the storyline is not focusing on the reality or sci-fi of the \\"alien\\" topic, sadly and quite disappointingly.     This is exclusively about human class warfare, predatory corporate monopolies mixed with politics, brutality and tyranny. Movies on that topic are very welcome.    I gave this only 3 stars. There is a severe lack of wonder, sci-fi, real science, just a relentless rehash of man's inhumanity to man, with aliens (poorly conceived body designs), run through the Hollywood routine and pumped out like another Dr. Who or Star Trek episode with essentially no high profile Hollywood actors used. The visual presentation is excellent, the storyline follows strictly predictable form, which isn't a bad thing.

6305127697|5.0|This is one of those experiences that leave a mark on your life.  One of the most under-recognized but significant movies, Primal Fear lifts the fog of blissful ignorance, and reveals the fact that evil does in fact exist in some people. Be on your guard, lest you, like Marty (Richard Gere), become an unwitting accomplice to it. Arm yourself to recognize it.  Watch Primal Fear.
B001FB55L2|3.0|*** Spoiler Alert ****    First, if you didn't see the original film, shot in 2005, you MUST look for it and watch it. It's a danish movie and it stars Connie Neilsen (Gladiator) as the wife. The danish version is, in my humble opinion, superior. The acting is rougher and more realistic. The story is shot in a less \\"finished\\" product. More grain in the image. Darker. And there are more details within the scenes. The brother who is held captive actually has a purpose in the camp. Also, he promises something to someone... which make what he does even more sad. You then see him having remorses without being able to admit anything. It eats him inside and he even tries to let it all out in front of his superior. But he simply can't. You don't see that inner struggle in the american version. Not as much. You guess it and you sense it but you do not \\"see\\" it.     And in the Danish film, the accident at the beginning leaves almost no chance for us to think that the brother-soldier will survive. In the U.S. version, you wonder why they would even think so fast that he's dead. After all, you just see a malfunction of the chopper even if it has been hit.     Is it because i saw the foreign version before the american one? But it seems to me that the actor playing the brother (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) is more believable than Jake Gyllenhaal who is still a great actor. But Jake does not look as mean as the danish actor and the work he has to do with himself is therefore less important... and touching. The relationship between the two brothers is more believable in the danish version, i think. And the tension and love between Nikolaj Lie Kaas's character and his father is way more subtle and emotional than the american version.    But in both films, i couldn't believe the love between the husband and the wife. But I could understand the passion between that same wife and her brother-in-law, though. But not between her and her husband. It's gotta be the \\"chemistry\\" between the actors i suppose. But When the brother-soldier becomes obssessive, both actors were superb, especially Tobey Maguire.     All in all, there are a few things that i prefer in the american version but even so, i recommend the Danish version first. More realistic and less \\"hollywood polished\\". Then again, seing both film back to back is also highly recomended as it is a great exercise for any future screenwriter.
1569242739|5.0|I'm not vegan, but I LOOOOOOVE this cookbook! It's so cute and funny and the recipes are DELICIOUS. It has your standard, traditional cupcake recipes (chocolate, vanilla, peanut butter, carrot cake etc) and then there are some extraordinary, one-of-a-kind recipes like Chai Latte, Pistachio Rose, Cashew Cardamom, Apple Cider, Dulche de Leche, Boston Cream Pie, even Margharita cupcakes! Plus many more, all of them creative, delicious, and very pretty. There are also gluten-free variations for vanilla and chocolate.  I highly recommend this book, even if you don't have a lot of experience baking. The recipes are straightforward and easy to follow. Amazing little book, with a quirky sense of humor.

1439190275|5.0|I was very skeptical of going onto the Atkins diet, but my friend was going onto the diet and I promised that I would go on it with her if my doctor said it was ok because I wanted to be a supportive friend.  I checked with my doctor, and she completely endorsed it.  Being the responsible doctor, and also because my bad cholesterol was boderline high, and good cholesterol borderline low, she did schedule me for a followup.  I am yet to have this followup, and will write again to let you know if as the book says the diet will do, the good goes up and the bad goes down.<br /><br />I can say that certain \\"people\\" of the medical establishment who poo poo the diet because it says you can eat bacon and such foods I don't think even read the book.  The book speaks of these things in moderation.  I also thing the average human being knows bacon on a daily basis wouldn't necessarily be a good idea.  I think you just need to think moderation.<br /><br />So, with the touting of moderation.. if you follow the books rules of eating 12-14 of your 20 grams of carbs on induction in foundation vegetables, at least for me, I felt that i wanted to eat healthier.  I choose leaner meats for my protiens, I do practice the moderation I speak and keep bacon to a minimum of two slices on mondays in a morning breakfast scramble.  I keep red meat at a minimum as well and may have it once a week as well.  I mainly stick to chicken, fish, and lean cuts of pork.<br /><br />Now I haven't followed the book to a T.  I have not gotten much exercise during the month I've been on the program as I am stil recovering from a number of surgeries I had at the end of last year.  But results to speak for themselves.<br /><br />In a month I've lost twenty pounds, and my energy is so much higher than it was before.  I don't neccessarily think the atkins diet is touting no carbs.  It's a controlled carb diet, but they want you to eat the good cards.  This is not the only diet that says it's good to eschew processed white flour and the like... anyone knows that a vegetable is going to be better for you than a hunk of bread made with white flour or a doughnut.<br /><br />I truly believe the people who poo poo the diet are in bed with the FDA and the drug companies, who just want to keep us fat, or in some people's cases, fatten them up.. so that they can make us sick and make hoardes of money off of the endless supplies of medications they will have you on.<br /><br />Now I am not a doctor, far from it.

0142406112|5.0|My son read this book on his last day of spring break.  He started reading it at noon on his iTouch and finished it at 6:30 tonight.  It must have been a great book for him to sit still non-stop to read a book on his last day of freedom before he goes back to school tomorrow.  In the first chapter, he informed me that the author already had written \\"the climax\\" of the story.  I kept my thoughts to myself, smiling, thinking this must be a great book to already have risen to such exciting heights in the first chapter.  And the book kept getting better.  He has already downloaded the second book onto his iTouch to read later tonight.  He heard about the Alex Rider books from the same friends who recommended James Patterson's Maximum Ride series to him.  He loved the Maximum Ride books and was sad when his finished the last book in the series.

B002UZCJP2|4.0|This was an enjoyable movie. The actor who played the surrogate of Bruce Willis had Bruce's facial expressions down pat.    The scene shown in the trailer in which Willis punches a female surrogate and the surrogate's face falls apart was not shown in the movie. I guess it was just too politically incorrect. Instead the director used a politically correct scene in a beauty salon, in which the faces of the surrogates are disassembled during the beautification treatment, to demonstrate that they are robots.
B00376AWHK|4.0|This is a great album, and sounds pretty good, but I like the original CD from 1990 better. The drums sound fuller. The snare is in your face, unlike the one on this new gold CD. Buy the original for under $10 and save your money. You will not be sorry.      Edit: The gold does sound good, but I just like the 1990 better. You may like the gold instead. Don't let me keep you from buying it. Many people like it better than the original US that I like.
0439023483|5.0|When a friend first told me about The Hunger Games I thought, \\"yuck!\\"  No way, was I going to read it.<br /><br />The way she described it made it sound like a gladiator-style, Survivor (the TV show) type book. I didn't want to waste my time with it. I mean, I just had read all the Twilight books and was mourning the loss of them and I wanted and needed something great to fill the void.<br /><br />She persisted and eventually won. I read them. I have loved the book ever since.<br /><br />Why do I love it so? Katniss. She is why I love the book.<br /><br />Katniss is a strong, resourceful, dependable, confidant, yet naive and a very strong-willed girl. Who wouldn't love those qualities? She also loves her sister Prim and would do anything for her, which is evident throughout the book. The most notable is when Katniss takes Prims place in the reaping. Katniss also doesn't realize it, but she has an effect on people. People from the Hob, her friend Gale, and Madge the mayor's daughters, to her fellow tribute, Peeta all of whom hold her in high regard. Overall, she is a survivor.<br /><br />I also have a special place in my heart for Peeta. He is a wholesome, respectable, sweet-hearted young man who cares deeply for Katniss. It melted my heart when I read about the bread he burned for Katniss and the punishment he endured. It also broke my heart to learn that he was never given a gift in the arena, treated as if he was expendable.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins does an exceptional job of writing a heart-wrenching story set in a dystopian society, where hunger prevails and punishments are severe.

030745455X|4.0|I'm not a big fan of thrillers. Maybe it's because I don't like the thrill of the chase or the adrenaline rush of constant vigilance and the fear of being caught. Whatever it is, thriller novels just aren't my thing. Then why the heck am I reviewing a thriller novel? Well, as a reviewer and as a reader, I try to read things in various genres and frequently supplement authors that I know and like with new series, authors and genres to help mix things up. Sometimes I find that I enjoy things that  I originally thought I wouldn't, and even though I still have my favorites, it's good to branch out sometimes.<br /><br />This philosophy is what first compelled me to pick up Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I didn't know much about the book prior to reading it, just that it was on the New York Times' Bestsellers List, was an international best-selling, etc. I was so fascinated by the title that I picked it up without even checking out the summary -I do that sometimes so that I can be completely surprised by what I read. While The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is pretty thick (thicker than most books I read), I devoured it in three days flat (not including weekends, by the way). It kept me up late into the night flipping pages and wanting more.<br /><br />When The Girl Who Played with Fire hit shelves, I was all geared up for more fabulous intrigue from Mr. Larsson. This time around, though, I did a little more research into what I should expect. I found that Larsson turned into the manuscripts for his phenomenal Millennium trilogy shortly before he died. So, while there will sadly no longer be any more novels from Larsson after this summer's The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, the Millennium novels will be his lasting legacy.<br /><br />In The Girl Who Played with Fire, publisher Mikael Blomkvist and the police are conducting parallel investigations into three horrifying murders and the strange evidence that points at young computer genius and social misfit Lisbeth Salander. Blomkvist hasn't seen Salander in nearly two years, after their adventures unraveling the twisted world of the Swedish underground in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and he believes it's time to break that silence. He's convinced that Salander didn't killed the victims. Well, at least mostly...<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is one of the most complex and fascinating characters that I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. Not only is she perfectly drawn, but her back story, dialog and actions feel natural and smooth. She is a realistic character that jumps off the page and pulls readers in. While I doubt many can personally relate to her unique past and mega-awesome computer hacking abilities, she's still compelling and written about in a real enough way for readers to enjoy her character.<br /><br />The Girl Who Played with Fire is just as engrossing as its predecessor, and with this new, more portable (okay, how portable can a 700 page book be?) and more budget-friendly mass market paperback edition, it's even easier for readers to get involved in Larsson's engrossing world of underground Sweden. Readers won't feel out of breath after finishing the book -just hungry for more of Salander's adventures. I know I'll be counting down the days until The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest hits shelves.kvist hasn't seen Salander in nearly two years, after their adventures unraveling the twisted world of the Swedish underground in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and he believes it's time to break that silence.

B00000JR29|2.0|This is a great album from the 80's that I have always loved, but unfortunately this remaster has one fatal flaw: it is remastered to be LOUD. It's a shame that this had to happen to such a great album. One example is during the song \\"The Working Hour\\" when the drums come in, all you can hear is clipping of the signal! Even if you disable your equalizer, the distortion still exists. So if you're an audiophile or enthusist, avoid this release and get the original 1985 release or the 1990 release. The purpose of a remaster is to increase clarity, not increase volume! I'm totally disappointed.
0739368435|4.0|This is a well-crafted novel, that unfolds as a series of letters. Each letter writer (and receiver) is a delightful character. In the audiobook, the combination of readers works really well -understated and comes together perfectly, capturing the spirit of the story. The narrative is evocative without being cloyingly emotional. Highly recommended.

0307473473|4.0|While GWDT got off to a slow start for me, once I hit page 82 the two storylines and two main characters came together and then I couldn't put it down. And by that I mean I stayed up until 5am on a school nite reading it and then blew off work the next morning until I finished it.<br /><br />The characters, both male and female, are incredibly well drawn. The storylines are rich in detail and once the story kicks in the various subplots and large cast of characters are easy to keep track of.<br /><br />It was really a pleasure to read and I marvel at the author's writing skills, his ability to weave so many things together. Also, whoever translated it did a pretty good job, becuase it must have not been easy.<br /><br />The only thing that prevents me from giving the highest rating of 5 stars is the subject matter that ultimately emerges ----<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT DO NOT READ FURTHER ----<br /><br />I was not expecting it to be a graphic serial killer story. I could do without some of those scenes floating around in my head. As such, as much as I admired this book, having read the prologue of the second in the series and seeing the tone and direction, I won't be reading the 2nd or 3rd book. Just want more happy things on my nightstand.
B0035RTWQI|5.0|While this is definitely a Devin Townsend album, Ki has a very unique sound and feel compared to some of his other works.  Many of the tracks are very laid back.  Indeed, some of the songs seem to be reaching for some uber-metal place, then back off in to a nice groove.  Some people have complained about this quality of the album, but I think it sets it apart in a wonderful way from Devin's other works.  I don't say this to take away from masterpieces like Terria.  Its just a different album.  There are definitely some rocking parts of the album, but there are also some great, smooth parts too.<br /><br />This is the first of 4 concept albums of the \\"Devin Townsend Project\\".  I plan on reviewing Addicted, the second, on its page.  I can tell you that this project is shaping up to create perhaps some of his greatest work.

B002ZG977Y|1.0|2010's Clash of the Titans has been billed as being an improvement over the original.  Unfortunately, this movie does not live up to the hype.  The only improvement that viewers will find here is in the special effects department which should be expected as the original movie was made in 1981 (29 years ago).  The CG monsters in the remake while more visually impressive than Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animations lack the personality and life he breathed into his creations.  These new monsters also look dated and uninspired when compared to other CG monsters.  Better CG monsters have been presented to audiences in older films (i.e. King Kong, Lord of the Rings, and Jurassic Park).  Being that these new CG incarnations are so numb and hollow when they appear on screen audiences will find themselves quickly bored.    The story doesn't help matters either as this story is less about the Greek myths or the original film.   This films treatment of the characters and storyline is more about the screen writers' interpretation of Christianity and their resentment towards it.  In this film Zeus is made to be more like the Christian god.  In this Clash of the Titans Zeus is a god who loves human kind and gains strength from their love and prayers.  Added to this remake is his brother Hades who has been conveniently transformed to be like Lucifer.  He rules the underworld and gains strength from human fear and pain.  The two are locked in a power struggle for control of the humans since whomever controls the humans will be the most powerful God.   Caught in the middle of this power struggle are humans and the demigod Perseus.  The humans are fed up with the whims of the gods and feel like their prayers go unheard.  Perseus on the other hand has decided to go to war with the gods because a boat that his adoptive family was on was sunk by Hades inadvertently causing everyone to drown except for him.  This spin on things has Perseus doing a whole lot of whining and whatever elseit takes to prove that man doesn't need the gods to prevail since this movie is a thinly veiled atheist propaganda film.    This new take on things is definitely no improvement of the storyline or characterizations of the original movie which were based more so on Greek mythology and focused on creating a believable fantasy world inhabited by awe inspiring beings and creatures.  The original film's introduction of Medusa and the Kraken are light years ahead of the remake's.  In the original film Medusa was a hideous monstrous to be reckoned with.   When she showed up in the film her scenes were chilling and suspenseful.  In the new movie Medusa has the rendered face of a supermodel and comes across as just plain silly.  The same can be said for the Kraken in the new film.  When the Kraken is introduced in the film it is one of the most anticlimactic moments in the entire film, unlike the original were in the scenes it showed up in were awe inspiring.  In closing this Clash of the Titans remake is imbecilic and completely unnecessary.  In fact this remake might possibly be one of the worst movies ever made.    Rating:  F
B00338QENI|5.0|An absolutely fascinating story that documents something that affects every one of us. And a damning indictment of the medical profession, thinking as it does that non-whites aren't much better than guinea pigs. Beautifully researched, tenderly and humanely written by an author who has been wholeheartedly embraced by the family of Henrietta Lacks.

0684874350|4.0|The trials of the Mc Court family were nothing to laugh at but I often found myself trying very hard to suppress laughter while reading. The humorous sections were not based around the events that were taking place, but more around how Frank, as a child, viewed what was going on.
B000W10AEI|5.0|You can clearly see what they've learned from the first film. The acting is improved and new additions to the cast do an excellent job at taking their roles to the screen.It is a very good adaptation of the book as the parts of the book that are omitted are the parts that would be least suited to film. However, some parts of the film are occasionally slightly cheesy - e.g., the end-of-term banquet at the end.<br /><br />I think this is one of the best films in the franchise and I think the films went slightly downhill after this without Chris Columbus as the director.
B00361DR4Q|5.0|I've spent big bucks for Anna/Rolando and Renee/Rolando Blu-Ray versions of Verdi's La Traviata, but this Angela/Ramon Blu-Ray version for under $10 is just fantastic.  Plus, also included are bonus highlights of other performances.  If you're willing to pay over $85 for an opera seat, you can't lose with this less than $10 Blu-Ray disc.  With DTS 7.1, don't be afraid to crank it up and let your neighbors hear the music while you watch this lavish production.  Go for it: push the button and order. Yes, you'll be amazed - it really is that good.  Thanks Amazon for making this first rate opera so affordable and enjoyable.
0385523386|5.0|The system is broken and women are amazing. If you believe one or both of these statements, then you have found your new favorite book. And if you don't, you will be so wildly, heartbreakingly convinced of their truth by Piper Kerman's story that you will want to change things - from the ways we judge each other to what we can accept as justice in this country to that extra screwdriver landing on Kerman's toolbelt (you'll see). This unforgettable book is as moving as it is important and the ultimate, beautiful record of how humanity can rise above a system designed for its degradation. Read it and let your world rock a little, think differently - better - of people and the treatment of people.
B002OG5GT8|1.0|I bought my E5 in November 2009. It lasted 4 - 5 months with very light use before the battery died completely.<br /><br />Until it died, the E5 was a fun device and I did not regret purchasing it. I used it with a Sandisk Sansa Fuze and Atrio M8 earphones (32 ohm). The E5 did not increase volume much, but it did extend the bass and give the sound more \\"depth\\". The tradeoff was a certain amount of hiss. Sometimes the music sounded better and sometimes it didn't. Classic rock sounded good. Classical didn't. For a mere $17, I thought the E5 was a reasonable purchase.<br /><br />And then the battery died. The purple light goes on when charging, but turns off immediately when the amp is disconnected and the device will not respond to presses of the on/off switch.<br /><br />I'm disappointed with my purchase.

B00127RAJY|5.0|The 30 Day Shred is the best workout I do! I have seen such great results... all thanks to Jillian and this DVD. I have been doing the Shred for about 4 months. In addition to my dieting (I'm on Jenny Craig), the Shred is the one workout that I have done consistently and always makes me sweaty and sore! :) After losing 40+ lbs... I feel very strong, clothes fit better of course and I feel great!    Pros:   - the workout is less than 30 minutes, which is perfect for that after work workout!  - Jillian's personality! I just love her and her comments. \\"I've got 400lb people who can do jumping jacks, you can too!\\"   - there are 3 levels that get increasingly harder. I've worked up to level 3, but I enjoy revisiting level 1 and 2 to keep things fresh.   - in addition to Jillian demonstrating the moves, she has someone doing it the harder way and someone doing it the easier way. This is nice because I used to do the easier moves, now I can do the harder moves. This just helps keep the workouts somewhat \\"new\\"   - the circuit training style she does is really effective. the workout goes strength/cardio/abs X3, which keeps your heart rate up the whole time.     Cons:  - This workout can be a little bit hard on the joints. I'm super careful with my form but there are a lot of jumps and lunges, which can be hard on my knees. So be careful!      Love the DVD... it's gotten so much use and was totally worth the 10 bucks I paid for it! Thanks Jillian!
B0035V35PI|5.0|I can't believe I've read bad reviews of this film. It was a blast! The story is very straightforward but the execution is VERY exciting and stylish. They did a GREAT job of making use of CGI to accentuate the brutality of the action. I think moviemakers should be very careful of how they portray violence in films, but it seemed appropriate for this one. And it was correctly rated R. NOT for the kids. I enjoyed everything about it and agreed with the decisions they made on how to portray the action. I look forward to the director's next work.
B00275EGWY|5.0|I have picked this movie after learning about it during 2009 Oscar selection.  I was happy for the first woman director, Kathryn Bigelow, who has received and Oscar for her film.  In spite of the fact that there are no big name actors in this movie (except for one), it is the story of the film and the art of making it that sears into the nerve about the war, soldiering and brotherhood in combat.<br /><br />It has been a while since I have seen a good war film.  And this one goes hand in hand with the best ones. It is insightful anf it attacks all aspects of what it means to be a professional soldier.  Main character is complicated - if not reckless, then he is totally oblivious about the effect he has on people working with him.  Is it the need for rush that keep him going or is it something else?  I will let you watch the movie in order to be a judge of that.<br /><br />The absolute credit goes to director Bigelow and the screenwriter of the film.  This is a smart film that will not take sides, judge people and their actions - it acts as observe of the reality taht at times seems mesmerizing and tantalizing at the same time.  I highly recommend this film.
B000GGSMFS|3.0|I was familiar with their music when I bought this CD, but after listening to it twice, it has become boring. Same type of music over and over again, same type of voice, etc. Maybe it's just me, but now my CD is confined forever in the bookcase.
B002WY65VU|3.0|Okay, here's one I changed my mind on more than once.  When I first heard of Zombieland, I was less than enthusiastic, but when I saw the trailer my expectations were suddenly raised.   When I actually saw the movie, after the first ten minutes, I was thinking 'great scott, what have I gotten myself into?'   As it went along though, it gradually started to win me over and I ended up liking it, although not without reservations.   It was a good movie, but not the great movie I think it could have been.       Zombieland is the unofficial name of the world after the living dead have appeared and decimated humanity in lightning-quick time.   Zombieland the movie is the story of four mismatched individuals making their way across this post-apocalytptic (although surprisingly well-maintained) land in search of sanctuary from the ravenous hordes.          Here's where the movie gets off on the wrong foot: although billed as a horror comedy, Zombieland kicks off feeling Far more like a horror spoof.  It feels like it's mocking not only itself but its source material.   The good news is that as it goes along, that feeling starts fading.   The parts that are supposed to be funny are occasionally actually humorous, and the movie feels less like a parody and more like a homage to classic zombies movies.  By its second act, it's become a genuine horror comedy, one with good action, a burgeoning style of its own, and, surprisingly given its opening, increasingly strong characterization and a real connection between the viewer and those characters.  The casting of the four leads is perfect - even during the film's bumpy opening, their performances can't be faulted, and once Zombieland really gets going and gives them good material to work with, they do fantastic jobs.  Jesse Eisenberg plays the point-of-view character, the bookwormish social misfit 'Columbus' (the characters all go by the names of the places they're from, rather than their real names) who thinks he's figured outa system of rules for surviving the zombies; Woody Harrelson plays 'Tallahassee', a guy who, paraphrasing the movie dialogue, 'was never good at much anything, but figured eventually he'd have to be good at something.  Who'd have thought that something would be killing zombies?'; Abigail Breslin plays the cute little sister, 'Little Rock', in a pair of sisters who've survived the apocalypse throug cunning and a string of con jobs on fellow survivors; Emma Stone plays Wichita, the hot big sister in this operation and the mastermind behind their schemes.   These four players give the movie heart and soul when it's most needed.  They find themselves thrown together against the dead, and start to bond.  Breslin is adorable as the sole child in the group, Harrelson milks material for his character that could have come off banal and cliched, but makes it potent instead; and the 'from-disdain-to-romantic-chemistry' angle between Eisenberg and Stone, while not unexpected in and off itself, is surprisingly effective.  And in a side note, thee's something about Emma Stone's voice that's just so hot...      The movie took a while getting where it's going, but when it got there it rocked.  The last 20-25 minutes or so is just great.  In stark contrast, the first 20 minutes was pretty bad (although even I have to admit that the slow-motion flashback montage of the world being overrun by zombies, all set to Metallica's \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", was quite cool).  I'm looking forward to Zombieland 2.   If it drops the spoofy stuff but continues on with everything that made the second half work so well, as well as possibly amping up the action and zombie carnage, we could have a tremendous movie.  As for Zombieland 1, it wriggles its way out of some tight places and ends up as a movie definately worth seeing.
B0036B8MZU|5.0|I love this series! ACTION, DRAMA, & TWISTS. What more could you ask for. This is a great ADULT series with a STRONG cast.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|Based on the most famous private detective, or possibly, the most famous fictional character in the world, Guy Ritchie's \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" looks like Gorge Roy Hill's buddy-buddy movies, or more recently, Walter Hill's \\"48 Hrs.\\" Action-paced, breakneck adventures with a health amount of humor, \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" may not be the most faithful adaptation to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's source material, but it is a hugely entertaining action thriller.    Set in late Victorian London, the fast-paced story follows the adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his recently engaged sidekick Dr. Watson (Jude Law). They have to stop the diabolical plot of mysterious Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), who seeks to change the course of the world forever.    In \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" (2009) the world's greatest sleuth and his partner look much younger than in other versions. The Holmes of Robert Downey Jr. is not exactly the same as elegant Jeremy Brett's. They are both smart and witty, but the newer one looks more like a James Bond or Philip Marlowe with a messy hair, always ready to fight with his fists. Jude Law's Watson is more resourceful than the original. The pair is really fun to watch.    Three female characters appear: Mrs. Hudson (Geraldine James), Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly), Watson's fiancée, and Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), the only woman who ever has touched Holmes' heart. Sadly the first two characters have little to do in Guy Ritchie's new adaptation. Rachel McAdams fares a little better as wily Irene Adler, but still it seems as if the director is not really interested her character.    The film's crew includes famous names: photography by Philippe Rousselot (\\"A River Runs Through it\\"); costume design by Jenny Beavan (\\"A Room with a View\\"); production design by Sarah Greenwood (\\"Pride & Prejudice\\"); and set decoration by Katie Spencer (\\"Pride & Prejudice\\"). Hans Zimmer's unique music, slightly overused, is still impressive.    \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is a rip-roaringaction adventure film. Maybe not exactly Conan Doyle had envisioned, but still very enjoyable nonetheless.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|Back when Bill Paxton was coming off of some great 90's work, Matthew McConaughey was trying to be seen as a serious actor, Harvey Keitel was starring in everything and Jon Bon Jovi was trying his hand at acting, `U-571' was born.  Like so many have stated, this film looks great, it sounds great and in the end it is rather entertaining, BUT the biggest flaw is the most noticeable and the one that will forever mar this from being anything worth my time and attention.<br /><br />It's stupid.<br /><br />Not only is the film largely formatted for the taste of American's (who would have ever thought I'd ethically battle a Matthew McConaughey film?) but the script is obviously thrown together with the most preposterous of direction.<br /><br />It's almost as if it wasn't even trying.<br /><br />The sad thing with a film like this is that it is supposed to be serious and believable.  When you are dealing with a subject as strongly enrooted as WWII you need to handle with care so-to-speak.  You can't take so many liberties, and while some can be somewhat forgiven (I mean, I understand the `leaning' towards the American side of things since this is a Hollywood film made from the American point of view) they really should be.  I mean, film of this nature should at least attempt to be honest.<br /><br />And what saddens me even more is that the film is reduced to a state of ridiculousness, with one impossible sequence after another.  It's one thing for a sci-fi popcorn muncher in the vein of `Armageddon' to pull out all stops in the `preposterous' side of things, for a film like that is supposed to suspend our disbelief.  It's another thing entirely when a film about a widely discussed and historically chronicled war is played with in a way that basically makes a mockery of a very serious and very controversial subject.<br /><br />If you're not going to take it seriously then don't do it at all.<br /><br />But, I guess the whole `starring Matthew McConaughey' should have been ample warning.<br /><br />So, in the end I have to say `skip this one'.  Yes, the effects are solid and the overall tone and feel of the film is `authentic', but the film borders on insulting with its handling of the subject matter.his one'.

B000H8SFMK|5.0|I reviewed the original CD years ago, but this expanded edition not only has a few great additions, the booklet also has lyrics, which are a great help. To me, this is famous partly because it is the only album allegedly sung in English on which I can't make out most of the words, yet I still love it. Normally, I am the kind of guy who says \\"If a song has lyrics, enunciate each word clearly please, or record it as an instrumental instead.\\" The Pogues break my rule, but their enthusiasm and musicianship are so addictive, I forgive them. They sing most things really really really fast, and sound drunk, and yet have created magic. Also good is a live album \\"Shane Magowan and the Popes\\" from more than ten years later in this lead singer's career. Try to own both, if you like the Celtic rock sound at all. Call them folk, rock or punk, the Pogues defy your labels and just give you a darn good time.
B00003CXIY|3.0|If you just want to sit back and laugh at the most ridiculously insulting and rather audacious attempts at trashy humor, then this film is for you.  In the long line of teenage romp/coms, this one is certainly not the worst.  I don't understand why these senseless sex comedies are so popular (or at least WERE so popular back in the late 90's, early 00's) but for whatever reason they were being released regularly every three months or so.<br /><br />I blame `American Pie', which in retrospect isn't really all that funny.<br /><br />The thing with these films is that they go absolutely nowhere and serve absolutely no purpose.<br /><br />This film centers around a group of guys who take a road trip (thus the name of the film) from Ithaca to Austin when one of the group accidentally mails a sex tape (with another chick) to his girlfriend.  Along the way they have some outrageous (and yes, comical) adventures.<br /><br />This was the birth of DJ Quails brief fame.  He is actually pretty funny in that \\"OH MY GOD HE IS FUNNY TO LOOK AT\\" kind of humor.  Everything he does has an extra layer of hilarity because he is so unattractive.  This was also made when Seann William Scott was a hot commodity (thank god that is over) and when Amy Smart was the hot young thing (where is she now?) and Tom Green was famous.  Yes, Tom Green was famous.  Breckin Meyer is the real star here, and he has that suave quality about him that makes him likable and watchable.  Sadly, his career went nowhere either.<br /><br />Andy Dick is gross, but he always makes me laugh so I'm glad he's here.<br /><br />Anyways, this will entertain, even if it won't stay with you.  You won't remember this tomorrow, but you'll laugh pretty hard tonight.  What else could you hope to want from something as ridiculous as `Road Trip'?<br /><br />I was planning on giving this film a D (which would have been two stars) but I kept hearing Seann William Scott whispering in my ear...<br /><br />\\"Did I say two? Better make it three.\\"
0143038419|5.0|This book is about a journey of self-discovery.  Escaping failed relationships that haunt her, as well as, her depression, the author embarks on an amazing trip that takes her to Italy, India and Indonesia.  She seeks filament and in the process learns how to relax and enjoy life and love.       The author presents an interesting(and very humorous) perspective on life.  Her sections on depression were hard to read.  Depression is such a difficult experience to go through.  She was brave to leave everything behind in order to find herself.  Had she stayed in her marriage and had children, what a catastrophe it would have been.         Having traveled around the world myself, I can relate to this book in so many ways.  I truly was able to find myself, and love, when I stopped trying to be what everyone expected and experienced life to the fullest on my own.
B0002KQNJU|3.0|Two incompetent vampire hunters, Professor Abronsius (Jack MacGowran of \\"Doctor Zhivago\\") and his bumbling assistant Alfred (Roman Polanski of \\"Rush Hour 3\\") venture to a remote village in Eastern Europe so they can substantiate the existence of vampires. \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers or Pardon Me But Your Teeth are in my Neck\\" is a spoof of vampire chillers in general and specifically Hammer horror movies. Mind you, this qualifies as a traditional vampire movie. The vampires have fangs, cast no reflection in mirrors, and spend their days in their coffins. Although the film generated a lot of coin in Europe, it flopped in America and MGM didn't help matters when they re-edited it so drastically that director Roman Polanski disowned it. Polanski penned the screenplay with his Repulsion collaborator G&eacute;rard Brach. Wilfrid Shingleton's production designs are first-rate. Nevertheless, Polanski and his collaborators scare up a lot of atmosphere in this 107 minute film. \\"Blue Max\\" lenser Douglas Slocombe's widescreen cinematography contributes to the air of suspense that Polanski generates. \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\" is one of those rare films that you could watch in the dead of an incandescent summer and contract chills from its winter-covered surroundings.<br /><br />The narrator sets the ominous but amusing tone of this sophisticated parody: \\"That night, penetrating deep into the heart of Transylvania, Professor Abronsius was unaware that he was on the point of reaching the goal of his mysterious investigations. In the course of which he had journeyed throughout Central Europe for years accompanied by his one and only faithful disciple, Alfred. A scholar and scientist whose genius was unappreciated, Abronsius had given up all to devote himself body and soul to what was to him a sacred mission. He had even lost his chair at K&ouml;nigsberg University, where for a long time his colleagues used to refer to him as \\"The Nut.\\" Along the way, angry dogs attack our hapless heroes, and the elderly, white-haired professor arrives at an inn frozen to the bone. Jewish innkeeper Shagal (Alfie Bass of \\"Alfie\\") thaws out the professor after everybody chimes in with a remedy to thaw him out. The first thing that Abronsius notices is string of garlic dangling from the ceiling. As far as he is concerned, Abronsius has found vampires and he plans to stay. When Shagal shows Abronsius and Alfred to their room, he forgets that his bodacious, red-haired daughter Sarah (Sharon Tate) is luxuriating in their bathtub. He promises Abronsius and Alfred that they will have use of the bathroom tomorrow. Shagal whips his daughter for constantly using the tub to bathe in, and she informs Alfred later that she got into the habit of washing regularly in school.<br /><br />Naturally, when Abronsius inquires, Shagal and his townsfolk dismiss vampires as nothing more than superstitious shenanigans. Later, the professor spots a hunchback, Koukol (Terry Downes of \\"A Study in Terror\\"), and sends Alfred off to follow the deformed fellow. Alfred doesn't get far, especially after the hunchback appears to dine on dog. At the inn, Shagal likes to slip out of bed late at night and sneak up to bundle up with Magda, the Maid (Fiona Lewis of \\"Otley\\"), but Shagal's wife Rebecca (Jessie Robins of \\"Billy Liar\\") has her suspicions. She tries to catch him in the act, but clobbers the inquisitive Abronsius by mistake. He never learns who struck. Ironically, Shagal manages to conceal himself and his vast bulk behind the door in Magda's room. Sarah pays the price of bathing one time too often, and she is cavorting in bubbles when the skylight opens and Count von Krolock (Ferdy Mayne of \\"Where Eagles Dare\\") descends, in his regal Bela Lugosi cloak, and takes a bite out of her beautiful throat. Shagal goes off to avenge Sarah and comes back dead and drained. Meanwhile, Alfred has become infatuated with Sarah, and Abronsius and he set off for the Count's castle to rescue her. When they blunder into the castle, the vampire patriarch awaits them and has rooms prepared for them.<br /><br />You can tell that this vampire spoof is different when a nubile young lady tries to ward off a thirsty vampire with a crucifix and the vampire dismisses her efforts with a chuckle because he is Jewish: \\"Oy, hev you got the wrong vampire!\\" The ironic ending is a big plus, too.stle, the vampire patriarch awaits them and has rooms prepared for them.

1594202249|4.0|Inherent Vice is Pynchon letting himself loose and just having a good time, which is exactly what you'll do when you read the story of Doc Sportello, would be PI, as he wanders around greater Los Angeles, usually stoned, on odd ball cases. Pynchon works in bad cops, even badder pimps, druggies, and ladies of the evening, but he makes it all feel appropriate with a levity few authors have mastered.    Doc is an immediately likable character and Pynchon has done his homework as he works in minuscule period references throughout the narrative. Nearly every chapter Pynchon squeezes in a song from the time, including the lyrics which was a bit overdone by the end especially since I knew so few of them. But the dialogue is what you'll crave as Sportello takes every opening to snake in a joke.    More and more cases fall into Doc's lap as the stakes keep getting more dangerous. Somehow most of the pieces fall together in the end yet somewhat haphazardly, but you'll be grinning all the way to the slightly lackluster ending. If anything the story suffers from Pynchon trying to squeeze too much in with aimless additions such as visiting relatives. Comparisons to The Big Lebowski are quite apt, but Doc is his own beast and is a much better detective than The Dude ever could be. If you're in the mood to see LA ala Dragnet style from the hippie's point of view this is definitely worth the trip. I'd also venture to say that this is Pynchon's most accessible read ever and not only because of the trim page count.  Great vacation read material.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Apologize for not advancing the cause of literary criticism by offering up a unique perspective on this book, but I'll have to join the line of Larson admirers and add yet another encomium to the pile.<br /><br />First, what a sorrow that Larson died.  From my age, he died WAY too young, and selfishly, we'll not have any more of this series.  After reading this first one, I immediately downloaded the next two.<br /><br />His style is clear and crisp with enough suitable metaphors and digressions that advance ones sense of who or what.  As long as the book is, there is hardly a word wasted.  Don't read Swedish so no idea as to how closely the translation follows the original, but appears to be a very readable rendering.<br /><br />At the heart of it are the characters, and Larson does an outstanding job of sketching rich portraits in the fewest possible lines.  Salander and Blomqvist not easy to like - they both have some rough edges - but each is notable for his or her passion.<br /><br />Finished this first one and now long to get on with learning more about each of these characters.  As to the setting, while not devoid of Swedish culture, one need not be Swedish to feel comfortable with the references and holidays and laws and such.<br /><br />Overall, by all means, read this book.

B0001ZMBV0|5.0|I had several of these recordings on LP and jumped to buy this CD set when it came out.  The CSO was at the time of these recordings, as ever, a magnificent orchestra, with the likes of Ray Still and Adolph Herseth in the primes.  And while Giulini became well known for Mahler and Bruckner, not to mention Beethoven and Brahms, it's the Berlioz R&J that really stands out to me.  This was a great conductor/orchestra relationship, and these recordings are to be treasured.  I could only wish the classical record industry was still robust enough that DG would issue a similar set of their recordings from this partnership: Schubert C Major; Mahler 9, etc..

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Ponyo is an incredibly beautiful movie. You can watch it for the wonderous animation alone, and blu ray is terrific. The details and humor make it an interesting movie for adults to watch, but five year olds go bananas over it. Truly. One of my grandson's friends insisted on being called Ponyo for quite a while! The story is akin to Hans Christian Anderson's Little Mermaid, but Miyazaki adds his own touch, pulling in many generations--the women in the elder care facility, two-career parents, and, of course, children. If you have been to Japan, you will recognize the little touches of modern Japanese life, as well as the Japanese appreciation of imagination and nostalgia--even ecological lessons abound. It is traditional Japanese artistry beautifully brought to a twenty-first century level.    I found the American voices a bit too recognizable for my comfort and thus a bit distracting. Since I enjoy learning about Japanese culture and language, I liked the film even better when I switched rhe settings to Japanese with English subtitles. (Sorry, Disney marketing).     Miyazaki has a magical raport with children that no other director has, and he consistenly turns out movies that have an instant appeal to all ages.
B0033G9OFA|4.0|\\"When You're Strange: Songs From The Motion Picture\\" is a mixture of readings of Jim Morrison's poems and non-sequiturs, interviews from all the members of The Doors, and the music of The Doors. At first a CD which incorporates the poetry of Jim Morrison and the music of The Doors may seem like a sequel to \\"An American Prayer,\\" but the soundtrack to \\"When You're Strange\\" is quite unlike anything The Doors have released before.<br /><br />This soundtrack doesn't rely on the usual chronological placement of songs or necessarily including all \\"the hits,\\" but aims more for giving the listener a sense of what The Doors were about, a fusion and interweaving of poetry with the music. Morrison's poems segue very smoothly into the songs. The poems don't seem to have been picked to add any context to the songs, or compliment the songs, or even the reverse, the songs adding context to the poems, but they seem to naturally fit together. They may have been the cement between Morrison and the other Doors. Morrison`s poetry and the music of The Doors has always seemed to fit together as if they were meant to be together. There's a couple clips of interviews where the band members speak for themselves, but it follows the film's agenda of using only period clips and quotes from the band.<br /><br />The soundtrack includes the classic album versions of the songs such as \\"Moonlight Drive,\\" \\"Hello, I Love You,\\" \\"Soul Kitchen\\". The live performances include, \\"Light My Fire\\" from The Ed Sullivan show where Morrison famously refused to leave out the word `higher` as requested by the censors, \\"When The Music's Over\\" from the Danish television broadcast, and \\"Break On Through\\" from the Isle of Wight.<br /><br />The one misstep on the soundtrack is the inclusion of Johnny Depp reading Jim Morrison's poetry. Depp recorded Morrison's poems on his boat in a darkened, candlelit room. The inclusion of having Depp read Morrison's poetry seems a nod to increase the commercial potential of the soundtrack. Even though Depp is one of the biggest contemporary actors with his own hip cache and was drawn to the project by allure and legend of The Doors (he's a fan), but Jim Morrison will always be cooler than Johnny Depp or any other person that reads his poetry. Despite Depp's strengths as an actor, his readings are understated and don't have the full dramatic weight in the reading that Morrison used when recording his poems. Anyone who has heard Morrison reading his poems finds his voice compelling even without music. Depp's candlelit reading sets the tone, his reading has a sultry almost dusky tone to it, you can almost hear the smoke of those black cigarettes Depp smokes curling around Morrison`s words, but it`s best to let Morrison be the spokesmen for his poems.<br /><br />This one disc CD, includes a booklet with pictures of the band, quotes from the movie's director Tom DiCillo, Johnny Depp, and producer Dick Wolf. The booklet opens up into a mini-sized print of the movie poster. \\"When You're Strange: Songs From The Motion Picture\\" creates an aural documentary of the film that can either compliment the viewing of the film, or as a stand alone piece that provides some of the documentary elements giving the listener a feel for the film.track.

B0034GK7DM|5.0|This CD is one of the best that I have heard in a long time. Easton brings each song to life with such conviction that you can almost see the imagery. I really can't pick out a favorite, and that is what constitutes a first rate work for me.  I don't usually purchase a CD without hearing it, but this is one of those rare exceptions. Pure Country all the way!

B002VRNIHM|5.0|This is some of the best sounding, high quality vinyl I have. The re-mastering was successful also. You will not be disappointed.
B00328G4Y8|3.0|A million years ago, when I first bought this record on vinyl, I thought it sounded rushed, almost as though they were out takes from AYE? On its first iteration in CD, it sounded even worse. Of course, by that time, there was so much more to know about Hendrix. In truth, this CD has never sounded better and hats off to Eddie Kramer and Janie Hendrix for bringing merit to this disc. What turned me around was the DVD. It is pretty clear that Chas Chandler was watching the clock and trying to crudely edit Hendrix's efforts to reach out, expand his colour palette and improvise. Chandler was having none of that and is pretty clear about his ethic: walk in, do 2 or 3 takes, get out, press the record, flog the public. In addition, it is also fairly clear that Hendrix was nearly done with Redding by this point. Redding's tune is amateurish and in comparison with rushed Hendrix is really awful. They let him sing and write one more on LadyLand, but Redding was roadkill by that point, as was Chandler.  The proof of the pudding you'll find in Kramer's playback of the extended endings on two of Hendrix's tunes: teh title track and Little Wing. In its official album form, the latter is way too short. Clapton and Allman, perhaps privy to the full recording, own the definitive rendition. Even Chrissy Hynde did a better take than what is on here.  All that said, this is an important document, and I would urge you to buy the version with the DVD. What you'll learn is essential to understanding and appreciating Hendrix. Pity he didn't can Chandler sooner.

0061807400|5.0|My husband enjoyed the book. He read it in a few days. He had seen the movie and decided to read the book.
0312370849|3.0|This book was very interesting to me. It is told from two point of views...Sarah's (past)and Julia's (present)<br /><br />I enjoyed the first half of the book and loved reading from Sarah's point of view...her story was awesome! I didn't realize that the French police were the ones who arrested all the Jews in 1942 and sent them to their death...I guess I always thought it was the Nazi's (germans). The story was heartbreaking and inspirational at the same time. I couldn't wait to get to her part again while I was reading about Julia. Once Sarah was out of the picture though and it was just the perspective from Julia I got a little bored with the book. When Sarah found her little brother the book went downhill then for me.<br /><br />I couldn't stand Julia's husband...what a coward ass! I couldn't believe she even almost considered aborting her child for that scum bag! I got frustrated with Julia when this was going on! I am glad that in the end she left his sorry butt. Toward the end of the book I was beginning to think Julia had gone a little crazy...I mean I understand wanting to find someone and wanting to know what happened to someone and all, but she seemed obsessed to me! I also was a little confused by her meeting William at the end...I don't see how what he found out could ruin his marriage that much. I wasn't sure if they were putting these two together or not...it was just weird to me.<br /><br />Spoiler* I was hoping that somehow Sarah's little brother lived and maybe the family took him in...that maybe Julia's husband was somehow related to Sarah and that maybe he would bond with Julia through this situation. That maybe he would grow a heart...wishful thinking though!<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed the book...not all of it, but I did enjoy some of it.

0743455967|5.0|`On Writing' is for those of us who cannot help ourselves. Writing is in our blood and permeates our being. Writing can be a demanding mistress: expensive, calculating, time-consuming, boring at times, periodically wild and certainly insatiable. Our efforts may often be more fulfilling than the product but money and fame would be acceptable.    Mr King's brief Memoir incorporates factual and anecdotal back-story regarding his development as a Writer to be sure. But it also brings into specific relief the `why' and `what' regarding personal style and choices of genre. I still disagree (mostly) with his stance on foul language. But Stephen, being Stephen, has given me a much clearer understanding of his motivation in using such. And I can appreciate that.    There is a Tool Box, if you will, that each of us who presume to write seriously must put together:  * Vocabulary  * Grammar  * Elements of Writing Style (King is big on Strunk & White!)  * The well-written Paragraph - not the sentence - is the basic unit of Writing.  * Read a lot; Write a lot. Reading is the Creative Center of the Writer's Life.  * Novels of Worth contain Narration, Description and Dialogue.  * Distrust the Plot. People don't live by means of a Plot  * Entertain `What if' Questions.  * Locale and Texture is more important than Physical Description.  * Be Honest in your Writing.  * Do your Research.  * Revise and Polish.    Mr King speaks to us about the contents of his Tool Box, giving concrete examples gleaned from his personal reading. He adds to this some delightful jewels of his own invention to help us keep on track.    He also addresses the business side of Writing:  * Securing an Agent  * Building a Library of well-chosen reference materials  * Professional preparation and presentation of a Manuscript    There are good reasons why Stephen King is such a prolific and popular writer. He is direct, vociferous, frightfully honest, and brazenly amusing. But one attribute he owns but rarely is being subtle. In regard to the importance of Reading as being substantively basic to Writing, Mr King offers the following opinion: \\"Reading takes time, and the glass teat takes too much of it.\\" So, if we presume to write, Mr King suggests that we set a schedule both deliberate and firm, remove the distractions of the day, and get to it. A great deal of Writing (anything of merit) is just plain `ole hard Work!    His book `On Writing' is at once an encouragement regarding that wonderful craft and just a lot of fun to read!     Four Stars then for Mr King. And a fair amount of applause.     Russell de Ville  06 April 2010    [After a second reading and some additional study I've got to give 'On Writing' the Five Stars. It's really quite an excellent book!]    RdV  15 April 2010

0316042994|4.0|This was a very different reading experience and still making me ponder about it.  Very complex book for sure, characters and events are described without much explaining and yet they speak clearly of the incongruous, ambiguous and often absurd lives of the British elite/wealthy family in between the wars.  Also there is serious lamentation over the fragility of beauty and youth. \\"He was magically beautiful, with that epicene quality which is extreme youth sings aloud for love and withers at the first cold wind.\\"  Writing is very sharp, and its humor painfully dark and analytical, particularly about the weight and irony of religious practice that seems to be right in the center of this story.

0446569895|3.0|I want to start off by saying that while I only gave this book 3 stars, I did enjoy this book a lot and would recommend it to anyone, especially those who are fans of Ozzy. There are some things that I was not completely thrilled with. First off, this book had more spelling and grammar errors than any other book I have ever read. Sure, Ozzy has dyslexia and symptoms of a rare Parkinsonian syndrome, but this book was NOT written directly by Ozzy. I do not believe there is any excuse for why there were so many errors. It just distracted me from the story a bit. Another thing I found rather frustrating was the lack of chronological order of the experiences that were shared. I realize that many experiences in life overlap each other as far as occurence, but it was kind of hard to follow when something would be mentioned and a story would be told and then several pages later, another minor story would take place far before the previous. Everything Ozzy shared was interesting but it is a reader's desire to learn when and what happened during someones life through the book that is written by them. I was surprised to find that virtually nothing was written about Zakk Wylde. I know there has been bad blood between them recently as Ozzy replaced his guitarist to record his upcoming album, but certainly more could be said and shared about the man who sustained Ozzy's fame through the years following the death of his former guitarist, Randy Rhoads. (The same can be said about Lee as well.) The book is separated in two parts. Basically dividing his life between \\"Black Sabbath era\\" and \\"Solo era.\\" Far more detailed information was shared about his life during Black Sabbath. Before I bought this book, I anticipated the stories of his life during the 80's, the crazy stuff that has made him famous in the media. Very little information was shared about any of those experiences, and no information was given about any of his songs either. In my opinion it seemed like the book was rushed to the finish about midway. Mix that with the spelling and grammar errors, it seems as though the autobiography was slapped with an approval stamp to meet a deadline, not that it was actually complete. Either way, I am a huge Ozzy fan and is happy with it either way, it didnt meet all my expectations but I am still satisfied. All in all, I recommend this book.

B002ZFQD04|4.0|As soon as Madonna's 2008 album [[ASIN:B0015D3Z4O Hard Candy]] was released it seemed like she set out on tour. After the giant spectacle that was the [[ASIN:B000KGGLCU The Confessions Tour - Live from London (CD+DVD)]], it was curious to see how she'd top herself. The 'Sticky and Sweet Tour' is definitely different: compared to [[ASIN:B00005QX8H Madonna - Drowned World Tour 2001]], Re-Invention and Confessions tours, this felt far more scaled down and a bit more intimate. Watching the DVD gives you the feeling and experience that Madonna put her best foot forward with this tour. While past tours felt more elaborate, complex and visually stunning, what makes 'Sticky and Sweet' stand out is the energy and vibe Madonna brought forth with this effort. In many ways, the tour is stripped down compared to past efforts: with the DVD, you'll see less graphics or editing done to make it more visually appealing (as happened with 'The Confessions Tour' where you had graphics overlaying the performances to give it a sleek, commercial feel) and for the first time since perhaps the 'Drowned World' or even [[ASIN:6304498977 Madonna - The Girlie Show (Live Down Under)]] tours, the DVD features Madonna front and center rather than distracting graphics and visuals.To me, it's the 'live' feel of the DVD, along with the mix of the music, the choreography and energy Madonna and her crew put into the show that makes this, and the DVD release, the best since 'The Girlie Show'.<br /><br />The Good: This was the first DVD release/filming of a tour where it felt like Madonna was actually having fun and enjoying herself. The past releases of her tours (Drowned World, Confessions) featured a somewhat reserved Madonna who seemed nervous and as if she was putting all of her effort into hitting the moves and notes. Not so with 'Sticky and Sweet'. Madonna smiles, she really interacts with the audience, her dancing is by far the best it's been in years and her energy makes this feel less like a tour and more like a street party. What struck me as different with this tour was how Madonna seemed unhinged; gone was the serious tones and messages that seemed to riddle most of her past tours. The Madonna of his tour is far more edgier and sexualized, she curses, she actually performs dance choreography that rivals anything most younger pop stars are doing today, she goes from pop to rocking out on her guitar ... she just seems revitalized, happier and more into this tour than the past tours. Most of her tours are split into different themes, as is this one, but they contain one section that's a bit of a downer. Not so much with this tour as she finds a way to insert dance and excitement into each section, keeping the fun, light, pop atmosphere going throughout most of the tour rather than only having it in one section. The first section, the 'pimp' section, is probably the most fun as she effectively blends old hits like 'Human Nature' and 'Vogue', 'Into the Groove/Jump' with newer songs including 'Candy Shop' and 'Beat Goes On'. The middle section, or the 'gypsy' theme, isn't as dance orientated but the music is still upbeat and features her really breaking it down choreography wise in 'Spanish Lesson'. The last part, the 'rave' theme, ends the tour on an upbeat, dance, party/celebratory note. To me, the tour featured a nice spread of music from all of her albums and as usual most of the songs were given the remix treatment to make them fit this new party/club/dance theme which made even the old hits sound \\"shiny and new\\". I liked the filming of the tour as it gives you the feeling that you're actually there in the crowd and shows off the tour and choreography from some stunning angles.<br /><br />The Bad: There were parts of the tour that lacked the excitement and enthusiasm that some of the best numbers received. For instance, '4 Minutes' just felt slapped together and entirely uninspired and lazy. The 'Hung Up' and 'Ray of Light' numbers felt old and ripped directly from 'The Confessions Tour' and as if they were just wasted numbers or should have been mixed to be different. The pace of the tour slows a bit when Madonna takes what seems like a break from the dancing and high energy and opts for standing on stage and 'strumming' her guitar during the Evita numbers, 'Borderline', 'Miles Away' numbers. If there's one area of the DVD release that I'd complain about it'd be the 'bonus' features, if you can call them that. First, there's the CD containing live cuts from the album. It seems like a missed opportunity not to include numbers like 'Die Another Day', 'Into the Groove/Jump' and 'Heartbeat' to name a few. And the biggest omissions? The numbers she added for the second leg of the tour like 'Frozen', 'Music/Michael Jackson Tribute', 'Dress You Up', 'Holiday' ... all were left off of the audio and DVD/Blu-Ray releases. This, I really have a hard time understanding. A lot of these numbers replaced the weaker numbers like 'Hung Up', and would have made a great bonus feature at least. Instead we're treated to 'behind the scenes' footage that doesn't really add anything to the tour or DVD experience. These numbers were what made the second leg of the tour really stand-out and should have been included and considering how much time has lapsed between the tour and the DVD release, it seems like more than enough time to incorporate these numbers either on the CD or as bonus footage. I'd also suggest purchasing the [[ASIN:B002ZFQCZU Sticky & Sweet Tour [Blu-ray]]], simply to get the tour in high-def and to get the most out of the experience visually and audio wise.<br /><br />Despite the minor flaws, 'Sticky and Sweet' was definitely Madonna at her best. It reminded me a lot of 'The Girlie Show' with a Madonna who wasn't afraid to push a few buttons, make a few statements and curse and flaunt her sexuality. While 'The Confessions Tour' showed Madonna off as a pop star, this one felt more like Madonna doing all she could to earn her 'rock star' status after being inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame. It's the first tour release in a while from Madonna that features her taking on real choreography, having fun and not feeling too concerned with her image or limitations. Definitely a tour worth owning.<br /><br />Check out these numbers/tracks: 'Candy Shop', 'Like a Prayer', 'Vogue', 'Heartbeat', 'Into the Groove/Jump'Confessions Tour' and as if they were just wasted numbers or should have been mixed to be different.

B001JNNDBA|3.0|Donnie Darko: 6 out of 10: Some movies just pass me right by. I found Amelie by the end more irritating than cute, I didn't laugh once at Rushmore, and only a hostage situation could coerce me to watch The Piano again.    Donnie Darko has a large legion of fans and I certainly understand its appeal. The acting by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore is some of their best work. The rest of the cast also shines with a special kudos to Holmes Osborne as our protagonist's father in what is almost always a throw away role in teenage dramas.     The school and kids remind me of my high school from the eighties, (Though this being Hollywood the music is much better than what the radio actually played in those years.) and the filmmakers certainly know how to frame a shot. I was even able to look past the Holden Caulfield and Harvey flashbacks the movie caused me to suffer.    So what went wrong? Well the plot for starters. Oh up until the payoff it's fine enough, in fact it is better than fine. One wonders how the filmmakers are going to pull it off. The answer is simple.,they don't. If anything the end of the movie reminded me of that atrocious horror film from a few years back Soul Survivors. Like Soul Survivors Donnie Darko holds your interest with more and more implausible plot twists and coincidences then cheats at the end like a bad junior high school english essay.     Of course Donnie Darko is otherwise superior to Soul Survivors and other films where the ending is a groaner (cough The Village cough), but after all that goodness the magic is gone and they couldn't pull a rabbit out of their hat. Even a six foot demonic one.

It's not often that I finish a book in 1 day, and it's also not often that I rewrite the beginning of a book review 5 times before finally settling on telling everyone that I rewrote it 5 times, but alas... that is just what I did.<br /><br />\\"Shiver\\" was a good book.

As a matter of fact it was laugh out lout funny in several parts.<br /><br />But...with great happiness will inevitably come great pain, and I will be honest with you... I did cry. It was brief and yes I hid it from my husband who makes fun of me every time a book gets to me, but sadness to me... in a book anyways... is a good thing.

0321543726|3.0|This book differs from all of the other beginner programmer books that I've read. First and foremost, this is a book about how to design solutions to problems in the way that a professional programmer might approach them. It just happens that C++ is the language used; many of the ideas expressed in this book will apply equally well to a number of other languages. There are lots of interesting ideas relating to the design of solutions that I never picked up during my computer science course at university. It is for this reason that I think this book makes a great complimentary text.    That said, I very much doubt the average \\"beginner\\" with no programming experience could learn C++ from it; it just isn't suited to complete beginners. You really need to have done some elementary programming already or at least be using it in conjunction with a formal course of education and/or alongside a better book for novices.     As readers are probably aware, the author is the architect of C++ so who is better to understand the ins and outs of his language. Unfortunately, being one of the best professional programmers in the world doesn't necessarily make you a master teacher. I've seen this time and time again at university; some lecturers just aren't able to truly start at the beginning. Others just can't find elementary examples. If you don't get a foundation example you can understand, everything that follows will be gibberish. I suspect that is what will happen when you get to Chapter 5 and start building a calculator.    The first five chapters are interesting and easy enough to follow. Chapter 5 will very much determine whether or not the book as a whole will be useful for you. The way the author chooses to develop his solution for the problem of building a calculator might be the industry accepted \\"standard\\" but simple it is not. It very quickly becomes complicated and confusing. What the author is trying to do is show the reader how you start with a prototype, discoverits faults, then move on to subsequent improved versions. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't really work for this example because it is too big an example for a novice programmer.    As I stated above, this book is extremely useful. There is a wealth of ideas that you probably won't get anywhere else. By itself, however, this is not a learn-to-program book. It is about the problem solving aspect of computer science. It is not for absolute beginners. Buy it in conjunction with another beginner book or come back to this after you gain some basic programming skills.

142313494X|4.0|When I was in the 3rd grade I discovered my love for reading. I was forced (as in pushed down the hall by my teacher) to go to the library and pick out a book. I thought (at that time) that it was the cruelest kind of punishment for a child that routinely finished her class work early, but what I learned in the end was infinitely better than what any additional worksheets, or gossiping with my friends could have taught me. What I learned was that inside a book was a whole new world. A world where dragons and princesses actually existed, where bullies got due justice and frogs could talk. What I learned was that the imagination is a beautiful and splendid thing.<br /><br />I can still remember the book I picked out that day, I can remember the characters names, and every detail of their plot for childhood survival. That book will always be the best book ever. That book is what helped me form into the person I am today, and after reading \\"The Lightning Thief\\" I realized that this is that same book only 20 years later. A book that will capture the attention of adults due to its interesting plot, but will transform a child with its ability to make them feel alive.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is the son of a Greek God, only he doesn't know it.

But things aren't quite that simple for Percy...he has an entirely different destiny to fulfil, he has to find Zeus's missing lightning bolt before he goes all WWE on Poseidon for snatching it. With the help of his only 2 friends (The daughter of Athena, and a Satyr) he treks across the US to confront Hades and bring Mount Olympus back to working order.<br /><br />The book, although obviously written for a younger audience, was refreshing, and I am happy that I read it.<br /><br />There were creepy teachers that sprouted wings and turned into bats, a best friend that just happened to be half goat and loved to each Diet Coke cans, a 7 foot tall car chucking bull, dogs the size of rhinos, very picky water-beds, a game of capture the flag...weapons welcome, and 1 shocking moment of treachery involving flying shoes.<br /><br />This book is what every great novel should be...it was an adventure, and one I am sure to repeat in its follow up books.<br /><br />Spend the money, buy the book, and then spend some quality time reading it to your kid.

What happens when you find out that your mother has blatently and magically deceived you for the past 15 years? Well, you become friends with a Demon Hunter of course. Silly you.<br /><br />Being kind of disappointed in the last 3 books I've read; it was refreshing to actually read something I enjoyed. Yes, it had vampires, and yes it had werewolves which made me kind of giddy, but they weren't the main focus. The main focus...Demons. Which I have to say, outside of the occasional \\"Angel\\" episode, I really wasn't all that interested in. Until now.<br /><br />The writing in \\"City of Bones\\" was FANTASTIC. The images Cassandra Clare created shot to the front of my mind like a rolling film, clean, clear and in amazing detail. She didn't dwell on unnecessary crap trying in vain to make herself look knowledgeable of the dark underbelly, she just wrote, she created her own Hellish lands, she added her own unique weapons and Downworlders, which made the book read smoothly from start to finish.<br /><br />Yes, of course you have your everyday YA plot points, Girl, Boy, Girls best friend which just happens to be a boy. (I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this) but overall, the angsty behavior was believable and... amazingly enough... not what the entire book was about. There was a different story, a good story...a story about Shadowhunters, and rogue Demons. A story about flying motorcycles, secret portals, and a girl who just wants to find her mother. A story that I, the pickiest person on the planet, actually enjoyed.<br /><br />I will say, just as a disclaimer that I was ooged the crap out but a character change in the last 15% of the book, (Sorry...I won't tell you what it was because its a pretty major plot point) And I pray to God that Clare rectifies it in the next book. (If not I'm going to have to have some seriously mixed feelings about this author.) But every book has it's flaws, even the greats...that's what makes them so memorable. That \\"flaw\\" is also what made me start reading \\"City of Ashes\\" at 12:45 last night. I think that is a good enough verdict for me.<br /><br />Read on my happy little Demon lovers...this one's for you!at's what makes them so memorable.

There is such a large twist in the last 10% of this book it will take a hold of even the most stable of emotions in you and twist them into a huge `ole knot.<br /><br />The battle scenes were enthralling! It was like the battle for mankind, well, vampirekind I guess, and the characters were so well written that just for a moment I thought maybe a new author had taken over this series.<br /><br />Mead brought a whole new element into this book: Ghost! Yes... you heard me. Ghost, like floating, see through, I thought you died in the last book GHOST! They weren't overdone, which was refreshing, they popped up at very inopportune moments like ghost usually do, and in the end they delivered the finally blow that left my mouth hanging open in awe.<br /><br />This book had the Dimitri scenes we have all been waiting for, there was an evil secret society, a delusional queen, several moment of mental instability and bout of jealous rage that has been building for a while now.<br /><br />In short: I LOVED \\"Shadow Kiss\\" it made me happy, it made me sad, it made me want to invest in a shack in the middle of the woods.<br /><br />Happy reading my new psychic network and don't forget: Just when you think things can't get worse, well...they always do.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|\\"City of Ashes\\"...WOW!!!<br /><br />Yes, I know that's not a very literarily stunning way to start off a review, but I was honestly lost for words. I LOVED this book. Mash together a very stunning Vamp scene, an awkward bury the dead moment, a masochistic Inquisitor and a Faerie Queen that has a sick sense of humor and what do you get? One wicked game of Demon Battleship.<br /><br />Yes, \\"City of Ashes\\" has a significant amount of angst scenes that were missing from the first book, but anyone with any sort of plot comprehension could see this coming from a mile away, and not without due justice. I don't think I would have like the book as much if they were missing; the heart of the characters choices would be void and insignificant.<br /><br />That being said, there was a seriously kick ass fight scene in this book. We are talking \\"Narnia\\" meets \\"Harry Potter\\" meets \\"Lord of the Rings\\" type intensity that had me so wrapped up I refused to put the book down for even basic human needs like... food... or the use of a bathroom after 5 bottles of water.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever wanted to beat a character over the head with a frying pan as much as I did \\"Jace\\" in the Epilogue of this book, and I am a little bit surly with the cliffhanger of \\"Imogen's\\" mysterious dying whispers, but that's life, and that's why there's a book three. (Which I am starting immediately.)<br /><br />Happy Hunting, and remember...if anyone ever says you're going to the Shadow City...bring a flashlight!
B00004RYZT|2.0|I'm just going to get straight to the point and say that if you want a live Rammstein CD or DVD you should definitely pick up [[ASIN:B000JLPMEE Volkerball (Special Edition)]] instead of this. The problem with Live Aus Berlin doesn't lie so much in the performance, it's just the quality of the filming and the audio is beyond terrible.<br />First off, the video looks like a bad VHS recording (faded milky look and all) and the camera rarely focuses on anything for more than a moment making it almost unwatchable. The audio might be even worse than the video, I'm not sure how they recorded the audio for this performance, but it certainly isn't a soundboard recording. For whatever reason Till occasionally sings in a very low voice at live shows and that, combined with whatever method they used to record the audio makes it nearly impossible make out a lot of the vocals. In the DVD's defense, Live Aus Berlin was released in 1998 and the DVD format was still pretty new so perhaps that excuses its problems, but if you're watching with today's eyes and ears you're more than likely going to be disappointed.

I learned how to relieve people of those  pesky little problems called hands (with nothing but a whip), and the long awaited prodigal mother returned...only to get an ass chewing from her 16 year old daughter.<br /><br />I was surprised, pleasantly, by how the \\"Evil\\" Jonathan was introduced, and was saddened by his actions while his crazy-half demon-demented self stalked around Idris.  Clare fixed that little \\"oogie\\" problem that arose in \\"City of Bones\\" and despite my conscience telling me otherwise I actually started to like a pesky, flamboyant 600 year old Warlock.<br /><br />Overall... I enjoyed it.  It was long; which even my husband noticed considering I spent all day yesterday glued to my Kindle, but at least when it finally came to the end, I actually got a well thought out ending, complete with fireworks and nifty bright pink drinks.<br /><br />The Clave learned a lesson, The Downworlders and Shadowhunters learned tolerance, and a certain Vampire finally grew into his own shoes.<br /><br />Who knew I would walk away from these books having learned something.... the most important thing...If someone ever offers you an \\"Herbal Drink\\" while your pregnant...kindly decline...and then find the closest exit.<br /><br />Happy Demon Hunting.... now... what in the world do I read next?
B0036XN2L2|5.0|1978 Scorpions opened for Nugent<br />& they blew him and me away! I<br />bought Tokyo Tapes & Love Drive<br />& always listened to them. I<br />think Animal Magnetism is my<br />favorite. I admit I didn't buy<br />any albums from 90's & now I'm<br />sorry but it's great cause this<br />album is awesome! Sounds like<br />classic Scorpions! Like UFO,<br />ACDC, Motorhead, Whitesnake<br />that the late 70's & early<br />80's metal wasn't a fluke<br />& MTV driven bands like<br />Winger & Warrant & others<br />who nobody could care less<br />about now days. These bands<br />are all still making great<br />music and the fans are still<br />dying for new music! I hope<br />this isn't the last album &<br />tour! I will be seeing them<br />this tour! I haven't seen<br />since 90's when I lived in<br />LaLa Land. I'm ashamed. I<br />will be getting some stuff<br />from 90's! wow I'm excited.<br />Long Live Rock & Roll!

0307454541|3.0|I had heard a ton of good things about this novel and I found the idea intriguing, so I decided to give it a read.  I am not a huge thriller reader, but I do like great books that have a thriller element to them.  I listened to this on audio book and the audio book was very well done.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist watches his career as a journalist go down the tube when he takes on a major financial entity, who he believes is unlawful, and looses.  He is sentenced to a short jail sentence and his journalistic career is potentially in ruins.  Then he gets a strange call from old-school industrialist Henrik Vanger; Henrik wants Blomkvist to investigate the decades old disappearance of his niece Harriet.  He wants Blomkvist to do it under the pretense of writing a history of the Vanger family.  Entwining with this story is the story of Lisbeth Salander who is a crazy punk girl who has been declared mentally unfit.  In reality she is an incredibly smart person, with top notch computer hacking skills, and an excellent research ability.  She is hired to research Blomkvist before Vanger hires him.  We learn both about Lisbeth's struggles within the Swedish legal system and, we watch as she is drawn deep into the Harriet Vanger case with Blomkvist.<br /><br />As I stated overall I don't read a ton of thrillers; so keep this in mind as you read my perspective on this book.  There were some things I liked about this book.  I liked how Larsson goes into the detail describing the characters actions.  I liked how the author fit many small pieces of evidence into a whole.  Larsson also did a good job keeping the multitude of characters organized and easy to recognize for the readers.  Overall Larsson did an excellent job on characterization too; both Salander and Blomkvist are believable and complex characters that are interesting to read about.<br /><br />There were many things I didn't like about this book.  It takes forever to get to the actual thriller part of the book.  Almost half the book deals with setting up the Vanger family tree and I found this to be a tedious and boring to read.  I think this could have been done much more efficiently.  There were some things with Salader that I didn't understand; for example there is a particularly viscous sexual scene between Salander and her appointed guardian.  It is gone into in grisly detail.  I understand that this scene shows some things about Salander's character, but I think that this could have been depicted in a more efficient way without so much detail.<br /><br />I also found it interesting that a good portion of the book is dedicated to who is sleeping with who, or who has slept with who.  The amount of time dedicated to casual sex in this book was odd.  I don't mind reading about sex; I've read a number of books with oodles of sex.  I just thought it was odd in context to the rest of the story.  I realize the story was about sexual violence; but that doesn't mean we needed to read about every single time Blomkvist decides to sleep with another woman..I just don't understand how it was relevant.<br /><br />That brings me to another point...if you don't like to read about violence, torture, and sex skip this book.  The majority of this book focuses around torture, rape, sexual abuse, and serial killers.  Again, I don't mind some of that but reading about rape and torture of women is not something I am really all that into.  So just a heads up.<br /><br />The biggest thing that bugged me about this book was how predictable it was.  After the first third or so of the book I had guessed what happened to Harriet, I also made some guesses about the torture/killings, and I was right.  So, I was very disappointed that I was able to correctly predict the outcome of this lengthy novel.  I was hoping for some surprises and all I got was a wandering and lengthy read.  The novel does tie up nicely, so you don't need to read the next book to get a fairly complete story.<br /><br />Overall it wasokay.  The mystery was fairly well put together, the characters were well done, and it was an interesting read; but I can't honestly say I really liked it.  The drawn out set-up, excessive sex/violence and predictability turned me off this series.  I won't be reading anymore of Larsson's books.  If you are big into thrillers and serial killer-type novels then this book may be a good match for you.  It just wasn't something I personally enjoyed.aracters were well done, and it was an interesting read; but I can't honestly say I really liked it.

B001IAOEXU|4.0|I wasn't sold on these triggers by reviews alone.  I was definitely curious but $5.00 seems way too much for $0.05 worth of plastic.  Luckily, when I purchased GOW3, a $10 promotional credit was added to my account.  So I was able to use it to purchase two sets of these triggers.  And give them a fair shake on my controllers.      Guess what, they work!  And they work really well too.  So much so, that now I am buying another set for my third controller because they are worth the feel and grip I get now with my controller.  It may sound as odd in reading as it is in typing but these triggers have actually improved my gaming enjoyment.  They are solid little pieces of plastic and fit seamlessly onto your controller.  The only way these would come off is if you wanted them off or threw/dropped the controller from some distance.    The only reason I won't give 5 Stars is price.  The company could easily sell these for $3.00 and still make a profit but whatever; that's capitalism!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been working out for 6 months with an elliptical trainer, 45/60 minutes 5-6 days a week.  I was getting really frustrated with the slow pace of my weight loss, so I decided to give Jillian a try.  I've heard about The Shred from several different people, and now I see why!  I've been doing The Shred for 2 weeks, and I've lost 6 pounds!  This may not seem like a lot, but in the 6 months prior, I lost less than 10 pounds with my long and boring elliptical workouts.  It feels really good to see the weight finally starting to drop.  I just moved up to level 2, and it feels like the first day of working out all over again.  These 20 minute workouts really make me work, and I can feel the progress the next day.  Plus, they are a third of the time I was investing into my workouts before.  I love the 3 circuits Jillian breaks these workouts into.  She keeps up the pace and it doesn't feel monotonous.  Now all I can say is that I wish I hadn't waited so long to give this a try.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Let me start out by saying that I love this series, and it looks absolutely fantastic in 1080p. Also, ordering it from here is quite a bit cheaper than picking up this exact same set from a retail store. My problem with it is that this particular version is one disc short of the full set available in the UK, and costs considerably more. In hindsight, I wish I had read more of the reviews, as I now feel a little ripped off, considering that I paid more for a truncated version of this fabulous series.  My advice, if you want a series from across the pond, check their amazon site first, it may be a better value.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|One of my good friends has, unfortunately spent most of his life with two insane women.  He is a great guy who has a lot to offer, but always seems to get stuck with the unstable sort who just take, take, take and drive him nuts.  Slash is much the same way.  Most of his professional career has been spent with two crazy, egotistical vocalists.  This time around, I think he's finally made the album he's always wanted to make.      This is not a rehash of Guns n Roses by any stretch. He could have pulled the ole top hat wearing, chain smoking, Jack guzzling Slash and still sold a decent number of records, but it wouldn't have been anything like this gem we have here.  Most of the time when you hear a 'guest' album the songs are typically garbage.  This album was somewhat unexpected that Slash appears to have molded the song around the singer, rather than the other way around.  He plays to their talents and styles.  Hell, even Fergie comes off sounding great, and I never would have imagined saying that.   He still manages to tear off some pretty good solos and riffs, and the variety of music here is impressive.      If you've been a GnR fan in the past and haven't cared much for blues, ballads, etc I think you'll be surprised at Slash's range of interest, and maybe it will expose you to a different genre of music you hadn't thought possible.      Pick it up.

B000KZBRG6|5.0|Though it's EV range doesn't make it great for very low light work, it's great for most \\"normal\\" photographic conditions.  I've used it as an ambient light meter with my digitals when I want that type of metering, and in both modes with my collection of old film cameras.  I also use it to verify the metering of old film camera metering systems when I repair them.  Obviously it's not a flash meter.<br /><br />It works well and I carry it all the time in my bag.  It seems fragile, but despite being banged around constantly, it continues to function perfectly.  It's compact enough to mount on a flash shoe and comes with a piece to do just that.<br /><br />I find the ambient light mode helpful for my slide shooting where I don't trust my cameras internal meters to give me the correct exposure.  By getting close in reflected mode (when you can do that) it allows something akin to spot metering.<br /><br />Overall, a nice thing to always have in your bag, taking up little room but giving great utility.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|This series seems to be plagued by packaging issues. \\"The Plan\\" is in fact in the set but hidden in the last season 4.0 box.     Other than that, all of the horrible packaging stories I've read seem to be negated with this set. The episode description/listing is on the back of each slim case. As far as I know there are no webisodes.     This series in many ways is like one long epic miniseries rather than just a TV show. There is a clear beginning, middle, and end. If it stands the test of time it will possibly replace Star Wars as my favorite sci-fi series of all time.     ------------------------------------------------    Original Post:    The DVD set released on April 6, 2010 DOES NOT include The Plan.     The show is great, my 1 star review is simply due to The Plan not being included. I was really excited about this, but the failure to include The Plan in a \\"Complete Series\\" set seems...wrong. I will just buy in separately, but hopefully folks will read this and not be as disappointed as I was.    Sadly, there was no real information on the product page. It does say 26 discs. The set actually has 25. I may contact the manufacturer and see if they can do anything, perhaps I was shipped the wrong item.    ------------------------------------------------

B001TZQITM|5.0|When it comes to buying a case to hold your compact camcorder and accessories, you can't get much better than the Caselogic SLDC-203. For a fraction of the cost of cases offered by your camcorder manufacturer, you get a well-built, lightweight, very versatile case. However, I wouldn't call this a camera case. It's too small to hold even a small DSLR, and it's way to big for most compact cameras. That being said, I own two different compact camcorders, and the case fit both well, although it really is designed for a horizontally-oriented camcorder.<br /><br />First - the highlights! This case is built like a tank, with reinforced zippers, heavy duty but lightweight reinforced nylon equivalent to a good-quality suitcase. And, the bottom of the case is molded plastic, providing a waterproof base that won't tip over when you set it down. Case Logic also includes a shoulder strap in addition to the carrying handle.<br /><br />My Sony HDR-HC7 is a horizontally-oriented, tape-based HDV camcorder. The Caselogic SLDC-203 stored this camcorder, memory cards, spare tape, remote control, two different video cables, battery charger, spare battery, glare cover, and a compact wide-angle lens. The main pouch has two compartments, separated by a bright orange neoprene panel that lets you easy see all items. I fit the charger, spare battery, extra lens, remote, and cables in this area, with the camcorder fitting perfectly above. The front pocket fit an extra HDV tape, although just barely. The 2 side pockets are very small - not large enough to fit a tape, but good for memory cards. (See uploaded pictures).<br /><br />On the other hand, my Sony DCR-PC100 is an older vertically-oriented, tape-based DVD camcorder. Although the relative sizes of both camcorders are close, the Caselogic SLDC-203 and especially its internal bottom panel is definitely better suited to the horizontal camcorder. For this vertical camcorder, I left the bright orange panel open, surrounding the remote control and video cable. The case then could accommodate the full vertical height of the camcorder, with room for the small audio boom microphone. The spare battery and an extra tape fit in the front pocket, but just barely.se then could accommodate the full vertical height of the camcorder, with room for the small audio boom microphone.

Excellent value for Enya fans.
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|What if 90% of the planet could stay at home in their pajamas, while a surrogate robot of the sex, age, hair color, height and weight, and looks of their choosing could go to work for them, as well as recreate, dance, shop, and experiment with mind-altering substances for them?  The only time you're not in your surrogate body is when you are 1) asleep, 2) preoccupied with a call of nature, or 3) stuffing your face with food so you can get back to the surrogate control couch.<br /><br />Life would be different.  You'll see that in Surrogate, the movie.<br /><br />Of course, the ability of 6+ billion people to be able to even afford this technology, its construction and maintenance, let along the extraordinary associated energy costs, wasn't really part of the story line.  It's an assumption.<br /><br />And that assumption spoiled this movie for me.  I mean, I like a good futuristic tale, but the whole rationale for most people to lock themselves inside, presumably until they die (because they only get more unkempt, overweight, out of shape, immobile, and older as the years go on), just wasn't developed well.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is a cop (duh), and he finds himself on the lookout for a real human who can \\"flash\\" a surrogate and also kill, remotely, its associated human handler.  Yikes!  And when his surrogate is destroyed, he has to resort to actually, in person, hitting the streets.  So there is grizzled Bruce Willis in a population of blemish-free surrogates.<br /><br />I don't plan to give away any of the mystery, so that's it as far as a plot recap goes.  Suffice it to say that Willis is a great actor, and without him this movie doesn't go very far.  For a fascinating story about how a society can develop when you can make copies of yourself (and thus do 6 things at once), try reading [[ASIN:0765342618 Kiln People]].

B00383YC2S|4.0|I disagree with user Dance_Dance_Dance´s review. In my opinion, this is much better than Psychédélices. Yes, it is more Electronic, but nothing like Trance music. I mean, it is not repetitive or loud. There are lots of good catchy rhythms evenly spread throughout the CD. I´m no vocal coach, but the singing sound great to me!     My favorite songs were \\"Limelight\\", \\"A caeur fendre\\", and \\"La Candida\\" which was a nice surprise since this last one she sings in Spanish. A lot of English lyrics in the CD too. \\"Les Collines\\" and \\"Eden, Eden\\" are also good too. So, lots of good songs, as opposed to Psychédélices which, in my opinion, brought very little to the table other than a comeback.    My only disappointment is how drastically she changed her image for the \\"Les Collines\\" video. It seems she wants to put the \\"Moi... Lolita\\" and \\"J'en ai Marre\\" days behind. I hope the \\"Limelight\\" video has more sex appeal.     Anyway, image aside, I enjoyed the new album. I give it 4 solid stars.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Wow. Just wow.     I can't even begin spelling out all the problems with this movie. Bad script? Check! Bad acting? Check! Predictable? Check! Way to long? Check! Two dimensional characters? Check! Silly situations? Check! Overblown CGI? Check! Cartoonish destruction? Check!    This review would be 30 pages long if I started to take this movie apart. But my biggest problem is the science. I know, this IS a sci-fi, disaster movie. I know they had to make something up to make the end of the world seem possible; I have no problem with that. My problem is that it seems to me that Roland Emmerich just took a 6th grade science textbook and threw it out the window, I mean, there's stuff in here that would make a 10 year old shake his head.    My favorite example: John Cusack's character is in a car, on an airplane, flying 40,000 feet above the middle of nowhere over the Pacific Ocean, and is playing with the car radio trying to find a station. He turns to his wife and says: \\"There's nothing. Not even an emergency signal!\\". WELL OF COURSE! YOU'RE IN A PLANE OVER THE OCEAN! HELLO?    To enjoy this movie, you have to know nothing about how anything in this world works, from the government, to airplanes, to even radios. My biggest problem is that these little things don't let me believe the movie. Nothing in it is plausible. I loved Star Wars because the characters and situations seemed believable, and that movie stretches science even farther than this one. But I can believe it.    I can't do the same for this movie. It just seems to me that humans can never act the way they do in this movie. Or airplanes. Or radios. This movie is a fraud. I want my money back.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|This album is pretty much about the pleasure principle.  No pun intended on Janet Jackson's song.  I've never been much of a Britney fan, but this album makes for good dance music.  If you can distance yourself from her scandalous and strange behavior you may be surprised to enjoy the music in here.      My favorite songs on the album:    Piece of Me  Radar  Get Naked (I Got A Plan)  Ooh Baby  Break The Ice  Why Should I Be Sad    It's interesting to note that this album reminds me of some of Kylie Minogue's work from the 2000s like Fever and Body Language.      It's true that some of lyrics are either questionable like Perfect Lover or silly like Hot As Ice, but most dance music doesn't have the most profound lyrics.  I wouldn't call this a classic, but enjoyable club music.  Just take it for what it is.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I am hooked on Jane Austen because of the romance. If you are like me in that respect, do not miss this adaptation of Miss Austen's Persuasion. I dearly loved the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds version but there is not as much passion displayed by Amanda Root in her Anne Elliott as there is in this version with Sally Hawkins playing the same role. And since we have two very different screenplays and directors, differences should be expected. The director of this version allows Sally Hawkins to look squarely into our eyes and pour her emotions out so that we could feel what Anne Elliott was feeling just as if we were sitting or standing face to face with her. And those evolving emotions of dread, shock, loss, despair, and resignation were palpable thanks to Sally Hawkins personality and wonderful skills as an actor. If you can watch this Persuasion and not be caught up in Anne's situation then your own heart is made of stone.     No true purist can give any film adaptation 5-stars and still consider themselves a purist. So, how much leeway do you give screenwriters and directors in retelling an Austen classic? If you are an Austen romantic I think you take each adaptation for what it is and enjoy that version for what it brings to us in retelling Miss Austen's story--whether it is an adaptation of Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, or any other classic novel no matter the author. Now I grant you, the 2K sprint at the finish in this version of Persuasion might have been a little over the top, but it did fit Anne's character in this version. The end of the Ciaran Hinds/Amanda Root version was fine for what it was because Amanda's Anne was so understated. So her catching up with Mr. Hinds' Captain Wentworth in the reunification scene being underplayed does not detract from that version, even though by comparison it lacks the emotion that was allowed Sally Hawkins' Anne.     Which is closer to the Jane Austen novel? Due to the ending scenes alone I would have to say the Hinds/Root version, yet they are both compromises due to length of time allowed and the fact that they are ADAPTATIONS, as they must be for the screen. The bottom line is that if you pass up seeing this version of Persuasion, you would be missing out on a wonderfully retold story and actors that will tug at your heart recreating Jane Austen's characters as interpreted by this screenwriter and developed by this director.
B002P5XXR0|4.0|Picked up the music soundtrack of Avatar. James Horner has written a superb principal theme- the pure spirits of the forest. Though there are serious overtones from the Titanic and Troy pages, yet the music is welcome and in the last year remains as one of the best creations. Sincere effort and well interpreted by his ensemble. Few days back, I had mentioned how he had a mesmerising spell on the score of A Beautiful Mind. He has done it again with Avatar. Cameron is a lucky guy to be supported by Horner.The soundtrack is worth it. Good sonics. One of the heavyweights this year. Go for it!
B0039OGGVQ|4.0|Guns N'Roses happened a long time ago for Slash and Velvet Revolver are on hiatus since 2008. During his career Slash has done many things; he`s been featured in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, his autobiography came out in 2007, he performed with many musicians on various recordings, made 4 studio, one live and a cover album with Guns N`Roses, released two albums with band project Slash`s Snakepit and two with Velvet Revolver but the self-titled Slash is his first solo album. He`s been occupied ever since Guns`big break and has not been resting on his laurels I`ll tell you that. Slash is an excellent guitarist everyone with some rock`n`roll knowledge will tell you that, in fact he`s as good as it gets. He may be a talented guitarist but he`s not a singer that`s why for his first real solo album (I still count Snakepit as a band effort) he got some of his musician friends to take care of that for him by bringing in the likes of Ozzy, Lemmy, Alice Cooper, Myles Kennedy (who will be fronting the band on the tour promoting the album), Fergie and others in the studio. A considered title was `Slash & Friends` which would have fitted the album very well. If I could describe the album in just one word it would have to be `diverse` because that`s exactly how it is; there is something for everyone here fan of Slash, Rock music or not.<br /><br />There are two versions of the album; the standard edition which has 14 songs and an extended version with three bonus ones `Sahara` (with Koshi Inaba), `Baby Can`t Drive` (featuring Alice Cooper and Nicole Scherzinger), there is also the Best Buy edition which comes with a t-shirt. I`m going to go through a few of the songs on `Slash`, I won`t go through them all because some other reviewers have already done so. The opener `Ghost` with Ian Astbury is a hard rocking one, killer riff and great vocals, this is one of my favorite songs of the entire album. `Crucify The Dead` is an excellent rocker and I`d expect nothing less from Slash and Ozzy. `Beautifully Dangerous` features Fergie, okay I`m not a fan of Black Eyed Peas neither am I a fan of her but here she totally rocks! She should try to do rock`n`roll more often, it kind of suits her well. `By The Sword` with Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother is great old school r`n`r. `Doctor Alibi` with Lemmy is another strong song and it`s surprisingly catchy, great chorus as well. `Nothing To Say` with M Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold is probably the heaviest song of the album and I love it! It sounds like an Avenged Sevenfold actually. The only song that I think diehard fans of Slash or GN`R may not like is the cover version of `Paradise City`, I like the guitars and even Fergie`s singing here but I`m not at all a fan of putting rappers in the songs doing their `yo` thing.<br /><br />That`s how I expected the album; to be diverse yet unpredictable but I am surprised that there are no appearances by any Aerosmith members as Slash is so vocal about his love of the band. Otherwise I like all of the songs and I like that it features different singers while still having that intense and neat guitar sound of Slash`s, his playing on the album is quite varied and we get a real showcase of Slash`s talent. Slash sounds like Slash and the singers sound like themselves ( and they all deliver solid performances in their own way and contribute to the album), when the two collide it brings interesting and worthy results. Like I said earlier I think `Slash` has something for everyone and a true Slash fan will likely enjoy it. `Slash` is not exactly 5 stars to me, it`s more of a 4.5, certainly a great album that I will keep and enjoy.zy. `Beautifully Dangerous` features Fergie, okay I`m not a fan of Black Eyed Peas neither am I a fan of her but here she totally rocks!

Otherwise I like all of the songs and I like that it features different singers while still having that intense and neat guitar sound of Slash`s, his playing on the album is quite varied and we get a real showcase of Slash`s talent. Slash sounds like Slash and the singers sound like themselves ( and they all deliver solid performances in their own way and contribute to the album), when the two collide it brings interesting and worthy results. Like I said earlier I think `Slash` has something for everyone and a true Slash fan will likely enjoy it. `Slash` is not exactly 5 stars to me, it`s more of a 4.5, certainly a great album that I will keep and enjoy.
B0030EWB96|5.0|Hiromi shines in every track of this great collection of mostly original compositions. It's like listening to Oscar Peterson, Monk, and some stride god like Fats Waller with a dash of Art Tatum, all reinterpreted for 2010. Now she just needs an album of solo classics like \\"'Tis Autumn\\" and \\"It Never Entered My Mind.\\"
1572814136|5.0|I bought a tarot deck about 4 or 5 years ago. Over all my moving I lost them and was unable to do readings. These card are bright and colorful, and they got to my house earlier then they said. All in all I was very happy with the product.
B0000009SM|5.0|This 1975 release by Frank Zappa can be fairly intense, yet is not without the levity that characterized most of his work.  In fact, I found myself alternately laughing and scratching my head over some of the passages, which are extremely complex.  One Size Fits All is a great album and I place it alongside Hot Rats (1969) as two of my favorites by Frank Zappa.<br /><br />The tracks bring together aspects of jazz rock; blues/rock; the avant-garde; and progressive rock.  Indeed, the opening track Inca Roads was featured on the Rhino progressive rock box set Supernatural Fairy Tales (1996). The musicianship is top flight throughout and features some of shining stars in jazz rock (Chester Thompson comes to mind).  I should note that although this lineup was capable of extremely complex ensemble playing, they could really just cut loose and jam too.  It is a nice contrast.<br /><br />The sound quality of this release is very good and the CD booklet folds out to reveal the album (LP) art work.  A nice package overall.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent album by Frank Zappa and should appeal to those fans of progressive rock and jazz rock that do not mind a bit of lighthearted fun.
B0035G1K7S|3.0|As others have noted, this is more of a watch-it-once kind of movie.  Jack White says it himself in the movie, the chances of the same thing being beautiful more than once are extremely slim.  What really annoyed me is that I spent the extra few dollars on Blu-Ray only to find all the concert footage being intentionally noisy/grainy.  Only the sit-down interviews were truly in HD, and that is a total of about 4 minutes of film.  However we did benefit greatly from the DTS audio on the BD; we got goosebumps during more than one wailing guitar solo blasting through our 5.1 system.  I will most likely sell this back to Amazon and buy [[ASIN:B002RVZV9U It Might Get Loud [Blu-ray]]] instead.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Ok, it's [...] bucks.<br />It does make the sound arguably louder and the bass a bit stronger.<br />I use it with my noise cancellation headphones and it gives me a bit more volume when flying,<br />It is amazingly full featured and has a built in battery!!!<br />You want more power to make yourself deaf? get ones with 2AA or the 9V battery -or - spend a lot more money and buy a big extension cord for your home receiver.<br />I love it!<br />Good job FiiO
B002ZTQVBQ|4.0|Great movie, a big improvement over Miyazaki's last two, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" and (ugh!) \\"EarthSea\\". It's apparent that Miyazaki is not a young man anymore, and he wants to make kid's movies, but when they are done as whimsically as this, even adults will be charmed.    Some people have complained about the art style he used in this film, that it's not detailed and slap-dash. These people are stupid. The art is obviously done with meticulous effort to emulate the style of classic art that would have been popular in the time that the original source material, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" by Hans Christian Andersen, was written. While the story is updated, the art is classic, beautiful and painterly.    My favorite thing is how Disney packages their Blu-rays with the DVD of the movie (and just the movie, of course). This is enormously convenient, since I have PS3 at home, but don't have a BD drive in my laptop, desktops, or any other portable player. Please, BD industry, take note and follow.

B000002IV8|5.0|Anyone who has looked through my reviews knows that I own nearly every OVERKILL cd (plus a load of their LPs) and that I love this band.    This is one of the OVERKILL cds that I have nearly warn out. I love all their music and their new one `Ironbound' is awesome; but this is a masterpiece. If I could give this CD a higher rating I would.    Not every song has speed, but they don't need it; the awesome thick bass and driving-pounding shreds are out of this world.  Have a listen to the sound samples of `I Hear Black', `Ghost Dance' and `Ignorance & Innocence' and you'll get an idea of what this cd is about.  Perfect tempo, perfect production and perfect attitude to outstanding thrash.    \\"The Big 4 of thrash are the best\\" you say...?  Yeah - directly below OVERKILL.

B002H3T3TM|5.0|I own the first Michael Buble blu ray, and to this day (and I own way to many blu ray concerts!) I feel it has the best audio and video of any of my concerts.  So my expectations were pretty high when I bought this one.  I was not let down at all.  Obviously, the behind the scenes shots are not remastered although they do look better than the original dvd.  The audio is perfect.  You really feel the concert experience.  This blu ray is a must for any Michael Buble fan.
030726999X|5.0|If there was away to give 6 stars to this book I would. For the legion of other Stieg Larsson fans, the third book is a captivating capper: opening mid-scene like a Bourne movie (only better), credibly pulling together the many story threads, injecting an historical reference to women warriors, giving a fuller backstory to Lisbeth Salamander - and leading up to a satisfying ending. Squash those rumors of another author attempting a fourth follow-up book. This is what long plane flights are made for. Three other immensely intent people where reading their [[ASIN:030726999X The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]] copies on my flight home.

B002POMHVE|5.0|Usually when at a college-age, you wouldn't expect a student to be interested in new teen pop sensations that are seen on Disney channel, but contrary to belief, I ADORE Selena Gomez. She is a brilliant actress who will, in no doubt, become a very successful young woman and this album is incredible. It's very energetic and uplifting. I'm one to be picky about my music and in order for me to enjoy it, it has to have a feel-good beat and in that area, this album thrives. It always puts me in a good mood and makes me want to dance, even when I'm in the car.

0307454886|5.0|This novel is filled with sex; all kinds of sex, including men fascinated by seeing a woman menstruating and kneeling before her and licking the blood that flows down her legs, a dying half paralyzed man, unable to recognize the people surrounding his bed, groping for a woman's breasts, a man who forever focuses on sex unable to do so when a woman is scarred or misses a limb or a breast. Yet, there is what the Supreme Court called \\"redeeming social values.\\"<br /> Roth is a supremely good writer. He portrays how an older man (62 when the affair began) has relations with an extremely beautiful Cuban girl from a wealthy well-bred family who is a third his age (24). The girl breaks up the relationship when the man fails to do something the reader may think he was right not doing. Yet, years later, the girl returns because of a traumatic event in her life.<br />Roth explores how and when the man, a college professor, seduces the females of his class, how his son hates him for leaving the son's mother for other younger women while he, the son, has his own adulterous relationship and, curiously, visits the home of his mistress to meet her parents and, as if he were a conventional suitor, to get their permission for the adultery. He describes the impact of the revolution of the 1960s upon the sex life in colleges and the after-effects decades later. He also examines how various characters fear and face death.

B001DRF84W|3.0|That said though, I TOTALLY understand where people are coming from when they say they didn't enjoy it.    Universal really fumbled the ball when they tried to advertise 'Hulk' as a front -to-back action movie. It just isn't, I can't put it any more simply then that. If that's what you are expecting (or had expected) I can almost guarantee you'd come away disappointed.    Ang Lee is an art-house director ('Ice Storm' 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon') and that influence very clearly shows here. 'Hulk' is much more a character study of Bruce Banner then it is an action movie. The Hulk as a comic book character was always, quietly, one of the more complex characters in the Marvel universe, as opposed to the rampaging maniac that most people unfamiliar with the comic seem to think he is. Lee's choice to explore the former when most people were actually expecting the latter wound up alienating a great deal of the target audience.    That's really a shame too because, although I wasn't a fan of the ending, it's really a terrific movie. The story and plot were really well thought out. The changes that were made to the Hulk's origin made a lot of sense. The performances were all great (Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot really stole the movie). It's just too bad that so many people were, I feel, led to expect something that they, ultimately, weren't going to get.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|This fills in my library of Harry Potter movies.  Good movie but still like the Book better.
B003FGMCYS|5.0|Many decades ago I practiced domestic relations law.  Usually tv is off in depicting the legal realities of it, especially in regards to the non-wealthy undergoing the process.  This episode of BREAKING BAD breaks the mold in airing the most excruciating real world depiction of it.  There is not an ounce of domestic violence in it.  However, the seething emotions are captured perfectly as is the police's inability to do anything when both are lawfully entitled to remain in the same house. As for Bryan Cranston, who plays Walt, he is sensational.  He looks terrible because he is both suffering from terminal lung cancer as well as the ravishing emotional burden of the terrible consequences his meth cooking has wrought. The actress playing his wife really shows her stuff in this episode as well. If you are missing this show, you are missing one of the very best shows on tv today. The DEA brother-in-law is now unraveling at a greater pace as well and my interest is quickening in his story.
B00009V7T2|2.0|That these guys have talent is undeniable, unfortunately they have nothing to say that engages me in the slightest. Lets start at the most salient characteristic of The Mars Volta. Admittedly singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala's voice is an aquired taste, being in the Geddy Lee range and his over-the-top histrionics can get on my nerves. But I could forgive him his high pitched warbling if the lyrics weren't so uniformly awful. Not that I dislike stream of consciousness vocals: Jon Anderson of Yes could pull off his \\"the mountain!, the king!, Siberian meat pie!\\" free association because I found what he was doing melodically interesting and emotionally engaging. Not so with Cedric. His lyrics are quite a bit darker and even more ridiculous because he makes the pretense that his lyrics have deeper meaning. Hmmm. Maybe, but I can't get past the \\"tapeworms as pets\\" sort of unpleasant imagery. Nope, just don't like it. if you're going to invest so much \\"emotion\\" or emotional signifiers in your music you damn well better have something to say. And damned if I know what Ced's on about half the time and from a purely musical standpoint the melodies aren't that engaging.<br /><br />Now as I said before these guys can play and all and its obvious these guys are talented musicians, but the songs make little sense from a compositional standpoint. At one moment they're playing grooving Santana like rhythms, the next drifting into space territory, then some bombastic guitar takes over, lather, rinse, repeat. Its a hard thing to describe. I don't mind musical eclecticism all all, but the songs often sound like random and unrelated parts tacked together rather than logical long-form compositions.  Even worse, the songs don't grab me and entice me to come along on a musical journey. For example with Slayer (or prog band of choice) I'm a surfer and Slayer is the wave taking me on an exhilarating ride. We're working together. De-Loused more often sounds like some jerk trying to hit me with a baseball bat and I'm dodging the blows... that's more annoying than entertaining and prevents me from getting inside this music. Its not all bad, but just like some people love the taste of stinky tofu, most others can't stand the stuff. I find this stuff not to my taste.ll bat and I'm dodging the blows... that's more annoying than entertaining and prevents me from getting inside this music.

0749953357|5.0|Seth Godin spends the better part of \\"Linchpin\\" giving you the much needed pep talk you probably need (that is, if you're anything like me: someone who was stuck in a low/no mobility job, basically banging his head into a wall day in and day out) to take the the initiative to get up, get moving, and actually do something with your life! Right from the start, Godin proclaims, \\"you're an artist.\\" You are, you know. Sure, you might not be an artist in the sense that you paint, sculpt or write songs, but you're an artist in the sense that you can bring creativity and joy to something in the world.<br /><br />Never short on examples, Godin walks you through the steps needed to become a linchpin within your industry. From the fear to make waves to the excuses we all use to avoid doing anything outside our job description (\\"my boss won't let me\\"), Godin lays out his argument in simple, easy-to-understand chunks.<br /><br />While I wouldn't call this a \\"detailed\\" management guide, the general ideas put forth by Godin in \\"Linchpin\\" are absolutely priceless.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|While mostly being a classic rock listener, I've always loved Whitney's voice. But my gosh, does she sound tired on this album.I could mistake her for Wynonna Judd singing on \\"I Look To You\\". Kind of saddening. Yeah, it's passable but not for Whitney IMO. I don't think it can or should be attributed to getting her older. But to years of abuse. With the exception of a couple of ballads the material on this album seems lousy too. Hopefully Whitney can get her voice back into shape.
B0036CWK8O|4.0|For those of you who are new to Helloween, or old fans that are thinking this may be a nice, updated greatest hits CD, it is a whole lot more than that. For over a month now I have had the Japanese release of this, and it is 11 tracks, around 60 minutes of many of their best songs re-worked into orchestra and choir (adult and childrens). There is also a DVD 30 minutes on the making of this album. A couple of them almost come of with a folk type sound, like the track Eagle Fly Free. Many of the orchestra sounds have been \\"done\\" before by other bands (Scorpions, Metallica, Deep Purple, Ect...), and are mixed well, but would not stand out as original. Much of the Keepers Trilogy sounds like it could be a movie soundtrack at times, and could be laid overtop of a live action performance story about the tracks. There is even a hint of pop sound here. Favorite songs are Perfect Gentleman, Eagle Fly Free, and Keepers Trilogy. This may be for the hardcore fans only though, and can be seen as a good thank you to fans who have grown up with their music over the last 25 years. This is not likely to be at the top of most thrash/power metal fans playlists. However, as pointed out in discussions after my original posting on a different version listing that has been deleted, this album could be an access point for people who may not have ventured into this genre before. Worth a few spins in the CD player, and for me, I hear more things things I like every time I listen. I have actually bumped my rating from a 3 to a 4.      FYI: I now have the US version release, and it does not come with a DVD (though the original amazon listing had CD/DVD), but it does have a very cool version of Why as a hidden bonus track #12.  Thank you again Helloween for 25 years of music.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|As others have noted here...2 versions available and you want the Attenborough narration...not the Oprah version!!! Why?

B002Q9VP3O|1.0|I was excited to buy this Blu-ray version because I've enjoyed the DVD so much over the past few years.  This version is actually worse than the DVD.  I actually returned the Blu-ray to Amazon, and they fully refunded me everything that I had paid for it.    This is such a bad version that it has actually brought me to leave my first feedback on Amazon after being a customer for over 10 years!    Note - If you have bought the new Blu-ray of the A&E Pride & Prejudice w/ Colin Firth and are expecting the same amazing high-quality with this Blu-ray, you will be terribly disappointed.  I will now wait for the US studio to release its Blu-ray version of Emma.

159562015X|1.0|I have purchased used books from booksellers at Amazon.com in the past with no problem.  In this case, however, I feel totally ripped off.  My boss recommended that everyone in our department purchase this book, so I did so.  There was no disclaimer in the description of the book nor was I aware that each copy of this book has a \\"one-time use only\\" code in it for going to a website and determining your own individual strengths.  The code is on a card that is in an envelope at the back of the book.  The envelope clearly states:  \\"Do not purchase this book if this envelope has been opened.\\"  The card was in the envelope, but since it had already been used by the original owner, it was of no use to me.  I feel like I wasted my money as the whole point of reading the book is to be able to determine your own individual strengths.  I feel I am due a refund.  This book should not be allowed to be sold if it is used.

0446563048|4.0|I certainly had no trouble reading Delivering Happiness; it moves smoothly through the story and kept me turning pages.  My disclaimer is that I can't tell the difference between Zappos and any other on-line shoe vendor so I am not moved to care about the company behind the scenes.<br /><br />Funny.  I can't generate any enthusiasm for writing the review, nor recall any particularly moving parts of the story.  If you want nuts and bolts of starting a business, Norm Brodsky, The Knack, delivers more detail and generated a much higher \\"% highlighted per page\\" rate (88 to 6, for the record).<br /><br />Perhaps I quibble with the title, based on Zappos' motto, that the highest drive in life is to be happy.  Some might argue that it is to be useful.  Not going into that semantic circle.  (But then, see disclaimer above--they're just shoes.)<br /><br />I noted two lines I will probably quote in the future:<br />\\"I never actually did figure out what a strategic partnership meant, and how it different from a regular partnership, but everyone who said it sounded smarter so we liked to use that phrase a lot.\\" (p. 49 advance copy)<br />and<br />\\"another trap is focusing on how to generate buzz, when really they should be focused on building engagement and trust.

0307454541|4.0|I made the mistake of reading too many of these reviews before I bought the book so unfortunately a lot of the plot was already given away. Still, this was an interesting book in that it allows we non-Swedish readers to get a deeper look into another culture that many of us tend to only know at a surface level.<br />  Larsson offered up his take into the business and politics of Sweden as well as some of the darker and I do mean, darker social problems and issues not always found in an Ikea catalogue or Volvo manual. Lisbeth Salander, THE GIRL WITH THE GREEN DRAGON TATTOO, is an interesting character and one the genre sorely needed since she appears to have captured a large female audience...wait, hold on, I mean, a large audience of females...not...nevermind. Several women I know suggested the book and I'm glad they did.<br />  Strong female leads are convincing even when they're small, multi-pierced punk rockerish tattooed little investigators. At 590 pages, yes it is a long book and yes, some chapters seem disjointed or aimed elsewhere but as for the book it is well worth the read.
B00006EXDM|3.0|I purchased this album expecting a SACD disc. I was based on what other reviewers said about the SACD version they got. I realized they reviewed the item a long time ago. So I have the Audio CD only version ad a lot of frustration. However, the contents are good material.
1400052173|5.0|The main character of the book is really the HeLa cells. Rather than simply writing a pure scientific treatise on the impact the cells have had on science, a human interest background story of Henrietta and her family, medical ethics issues, or a probing investigation into race and social class, the author includes all of these an more. It is very well researched and presented. The way the focus of the book moves from subject to subject from time period to time period is surprisingly easy to follow. It reminded me a bit of the book \\"The Orchid Thief\\" in the way the material was presented. Most importantly I think the book tells the story with an unbiased viewpoint. When an inference can be drawn from the story, the author allows readers to drawn their own conclusions. I only wish that tv \\"news\\" programs held themselves to this level of journalism.

0385504225|4.0|The latest Robert Langdon saga takes place in one day. As per Brown's prior works, things move apace, breakneck speeding along and when it would appear that the novel should reach its climax the reader notices there is a lot of novel left.    Those who seem to find nothing but disparaging comments about this story, all I would say is: it does what it sets out to do, tell the tale and take the reader along for a good, fun ride.     I will not say that I think Mr. Brown is a National Treasure, but I'd rather read him than, say, Nicholas Sparks. (Nothing against Sparks, either: just not my preference.)    There are a few moments that are cause for the scratching of the scalp. One character has a hand amputated (this is not a spoiler, it happens early in the story), and that kind of procedure would be catastrophic, both physically and psychologically speaking, and yet, apparently, even more than Mr. Langdon, this is an ubermensch, capable of leaping such a loss with nary a concern.     To which I say: Okay, then. Whee!! Lay on, MacDuff.     Overall, a good read, perfect for a beach. If you want deep, great literature, you are looking in the wrong direction.

I'm not a big Jolie fan, but i really think she did an outstanding job in the movie.  This is one of the few movies she stars in that i own.  This movie is well written & directed, you fall deeply into the story and for me as a mother of two small children i definatly got emotionally involved with the main charecter.  All around this is a 5 star buy...the price on amazon is unbeatable, the blu ray quality picture and sound is amazing, and the story/acting ect is awsome.  definatly reccommend.

B001OQCV2O|3.0|This blu-ray release is very good, in Picture Quality and Audio. The Extras are fine. But the film's plot is not that strong. Is difficult to connect to the main characters.

Not only through its shooting, catatonic CGI, and Perfect portrayals (Mark Valley is the least suspectable suspect) but the images are perfectly designed. Set Direction is carefully considered. A truly consumate Production. Another JJ Abrams piece of Brilliance.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I gotta tell ya' that this is a great film, I was impressed by everything in this release and by the creativity that J.J. Abrams has.<br /><br />The Picture Quality is one of the Best on Blu-ray yet, as well as the Audio. It has good Extras too.<br /><br />I recommend it for everyone who wants to be entertained by a great movie and be amazed by some kick-ass Picture and Audio Quality!
B00005MP58|5.0|This love story is beautiful by design and portrayal. The classic Jane Austen story is brought to life by A&E in a very comprehensive portrayal of the novel. It is long and, in some parts, cumbersome, but this series really fleshes out the novel in a way that a movie cannot. It certainly develops the characters fully and, I find a more believable Lizzy and a more dynamic Pemberly.  The recent Movie is a quick gloss over of a very complicated story. This is the real deal.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blind Side is truly a movie about the spirit of humanity. I was totally surprised at the depth of this movie. I did not see it in theaters I decided to wait for the DVD release. Sandra Bullock showed me that she can play a dramatic role. I think there are more stories to be told of the good things that people do; but, in the spirit of love \\"The Blind Side\\" struck a chord in my heart and made me believe there are people who want to make a difference in other's lives and this movie tells that story well.     I recommend this movie to everyone. The Blind Side will totally catch you off guard. You'll be looking for entertainment and after viewing it, you will search within and ask \\"What can I do to make someone's life better?\\"     Hat's Off to all involved in making this beautiful movie!!
1592332803|5.0|I love this cookbook! I just got this a few days ago and have already made the Apple Cake and Corn Bread. I love them.<br /><br />Colleen makes the recipes easy to follow and all of the ingredients are easy to find/use.<br /><br />Definitely try it out! You're not going to make dessert \\"healthy\\" but this is as close as you can get!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|2012 is an action packed sequence of natural disasters that could wipe out our world as we know it. I saw it in theaters and decided to add it to my home DVD collection. It was nice to see Woody Harrelson again, playing a character that many thought was a nut case in the movie who actually turned out to be pretty savvy in geology and predicting the impending doom through natural disasters. This movie did not miss the action nor the special effects. I recommend this movie to any one who truly enjoys superb special effects.
0393072231|5.0|I am a big fan of the content in non fiction books, but not always a fan of reading them (too boring).  This book was not only educational it was a page turner.  Michael Lewis explained to me what happened, reinforced some of the opinions I had (which prior to the book had been based more on my growing gut rather than facts)and did it in a very personal way.  The people in the book are more than just names, they are people with real emotions and that makes all the difference for me.    Don't let the 3 star rating keep you from this book, the Kindle protest is the only reason this 5 star book is being rated 3 stars.
0071636080|5.0|Przyznam sie iz do tej ksiazki podszedlem z lekkim dystansem. Z jednej strony wszyscy ktorzy widzieli wystapienia Stevena Jobsa, wiedza jak skuteczna jest osoba w swoich prezentacjach, z drugiej obwialem sie ze ksiazka bedzie miala malo tresci merytorycznej i skoncentruje sie na samym Jobsie a nie na formie prezentacji.     Zostalem bardzo milo zaskoczony. Ksiazka zawiera bardzo duzo praktycznych informacji prezentowanych na przykladach wystapien Stevena Joba i rozkladaniu tych wystapien na czynniki pierwsze. Wystapienia sa analizowane pod katem tego jak wyglada praktyka prowadzenia prezentacji. Jest ona dla mnie bardzo dobrym rozwinieciem innych pozycji dotyczacych sztuki prezentacji, ktore czesto nie mialy w sobie tak praktycznego watku i to jeszcze opisywanego  w kontekscie jaki sporo z nas zna. Wiele osob zna bowiem produkty Apple, sporo widzialo wystapienia Jobsa, mozna wiec sobie lepiej wyobrazic a nawet odtworzyc na YouTube i zobaczyc jak to co jest opisane w ksiazce wyglada w praktyce. YouTube jest wiec bardzo dobrym rozwinieciem ksiazki w postaci darmowego materialu video.     Ksiazke czyta sie raczej jak dobra opowiesc a nie podrecznik do nauczenia sie sztuki prezentacji. Dzieje sie tak dzieki temu iz zawiera ona duzo informacji z historii Apple i opisuje produkty ktore sporo z nas zna. Dodatkowym bardzo waznym moim zdaniem plusem jest to iz przy okazji mozna dowiedziec sie duzo o tym jak wygladaja procesy wprowadzania produktow Apple na rynek. Rekomenduje ja kazdej osobie ktora pracuje nad wprowadzaniem nowych produktow. Jest to duze rodlo informacji na temat tego jak przygotowac komunikacje, jak jest pozycjonowany produkt, jak sa podejmowane decyzje aby go wyroznic, no i oczywiscie o tym jak zaprezentowac go swoim klientom.     Istotna pozycja w bibliotece nie tylko osob zainteresowanych rozwijaniem sztuki prezentacji ale rowniez pasjonatow Apple i osob rozwijajacych produkty.
B00006G8K0|5.0|Horror of Dracula is one of the best Hammer's film and brings Christopher Lee's finest acting. The art direction is powerful and the technicolor cinematography is ashtonishing. Horror of Dracula is Cult and classic at the same time.
1400077915|5.0|Although I've certainly known of Alice Munro for many years, I had not read her work until this year.  My first Munro collection was The Progress of Love.  I liked but didn't love it.  I found it haunting but somewhat bleak.  I concluded that I'd need to read more by Ms. Munro before I could decide if she was my cup of tea.    Runaway was by the same author and the form was basically the same as The Progress of Love and yet I found it to be a significant step up.  I loved almost all of the stories in this collection with each one being memorable.    As other reviewers mention, there are 3 related stories of a character named Juliet.  They take place at different points in her life.  While the final story is by far my least favorite of the three, that is only because the first two are so strong.  I would have loved to have read a novel about Juliet's life and the sum of the the three stories was basically a novella.    These stories are of women who are all different and have unique moments.  The title story about a younger woman who seeks help from an older neighbor set the tone and I was hooked from there on.    There are stories that I don't love everything about.  As an example, I'm not that fond of strange twists as in the story Tricks.  It didn't quite work for me.    I cannot recall a stronger, more consistent collection of short stories and this will definitely encourage me to read The Love of A Good Woman which is the other Munro collection that I already own.    This is outstanding work and I highly recommend it.
B0035V35PI|5.0|This movie is by far the best ninja movie I've ever seen. If you are looking for a good ninja movie with intense sword fighting, plenty of blood and severed limbs than ninja assassin is what you are looking for. The ninjas in this movie use more stealth tactics than any other movie that tries to portrey ninjas by using the shadows against there enemies and moving without sound. One of my favorite parts is when the SWAT team  is is being ambushed by an army of ninjas in a dark factory. Awsome use of ninja and shadow special effects.
0134354583|5.0|This book is extremely interesting and entertaining and it's my favorite piece ever written. I highly reccommend purchasing this book. It's also hardcover, and very inexpensive.
0307463745|5.0|A must read for everyone - even if you don't intend to start a business. This book delivers a healthy dose of common sense and reality that is much needed in today's world. A pleasure to read and reflect on.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|This is a great DVD for lovers of all things military, especially those interested in Recon Marines.  In my opinion, Recon Marines are generally misunderstood or not as popular as other Elite Forces such as Rangers, Green Berets and Navy SEALs.  This is NOT a documentary on the Iraq War.  There are No political arguments and NO sides are taken, other than those of each individual Marine.  What this is is the best account of what day to day life is for this Elite Battalion of Recon Marines during the opening days and weeks of the Iraq War.      This is a first hand account of what these men endured and experienced in Iraq.  It is raw and real.  It stays very true to the book of the same name (which I would also give 5 stars.)  If you want to know what it felt like to invade Iraq, buy this DVD.  Best 7 hours I've had in a long time.
B000YABYLA|5.0|There are plenty of other movies with a similar theme, but this movie shines because of various differentiations, not least being the special quirkiness in a lovable way of the lead character.<br />Juno Mc Guff (Ellen Page) ,a 16 year girl, cute, quirky and with a quick wit and sarcastic tongue) is a girl who marches to her own beat. Juno hides her own emotions and fears under her wisecracks and perky demeanor.<br /><br />When she finds out she is pregnant  by her  on and off boyfriend, the shy Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) she decides against aborting the baby (which has astonishingly led to attack on the movie by some radical leftist-feminists for the implicit that might be alternatives to abortion). she finds a yuppie couple Vanessa  and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) but gets more involved with their lives than she hopes to be.<br />Juno's deadpan dad Mac MacGuff (J.K. Simmons) domineering step mother Brenda 'Bren' MacGuff (Allison Janney), and her incorrigible friend friend , Leah (Olivia Thirlby) add colour to the production, it is the dialogue that makes this movie, there is more to it than just the plot and you have to see the well done interplay to see what I mean!
B00009P1O0|5.0|This is the album, more than any other, where Neil Young publicly \\"turns the corner\\" and begins to recover from his losses of many good friends to drugs, celebrity, and the music biz. As always, the songs are open to endless interpretation, but anyway... \\"Walk On\\", about leaving behind those he could not save. \\"See the Sky\\", an old song given a smooth, electric-piano-based reading. \\"Revolution Blues\\", a dire but funny rocker featuring Rick Danko and Levon Helm on bass and drums. \\"For the Turnstiles\\", a little acoustic number about feeling let down after entertaining the crowd, featuring banjo and painfully intense vocals. \\"Vampire Blues\\", an early look at the contradiction between loving big gas-guzzling cars, and loving unspoiled nature, intentionally over-the-top (hint: blood == oil). \\"On the Beach\\", gently mocking his \\"sad LA hippie\\" image and featuring a wonderful slow-blues guitar lead. \\"Motion Pictures\\", a quiet announcement that he has found a measure of peace and a sense of direction, his own \\"dream\\". And finally, \\"Ambulance Blues\\", a long, rambling folk song full of memorable lines, sung in a shockingly (for Neil Young) deep, mellow voice.    To my ears, this album is as smoothly produced as any Neil Young album, and slicker than most. Other than \\"Turnstiles\\", everything is strictly in key and in tune. Legend has this the other way around, but to me, \\"Harvest\\" sounds depressed and lethargic, and \\"On the Beach\\" sounds peaceful and strong.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|With all the hype that came with this album ahead of time, I was a bit worried that it would be disappointing.  I was also worried that only a couple of the artists would fit with Slash's style, but this whole album rocks.  I don't think there is a single bad song on here.
0743201140|1.0|Buying this book used is a big mistake.  Assuming a previous owner used the one-time access code, you won't be allowed to take the stregths profile online.  I was very disappointed and frustrated.  There isn't even a way to pay a little more for a new access code.  I was just stuck.    The book was pretty weak anyway in terms of practical advice a person could apply right away.      One section on managing employees with different strengths had a reasonable amount of practical advice, but you'd need to know their \\"themes\\" for this to do much good.      Buying it new might make sense if you really enjoy learning more about what makes you tick. Without access to the online profile, that won't be part of your experience anyway.
B0015DROBO|5.0|A retired army colonel suggested I read this book, and although it took awhile to get around to it, I was so glad I did.  It carries you away into a world both fascinating and strange.  If you haven't read it yet, you must.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|The new Sherlock Homes movie was a very well done, action oriented movie.  I will say up front that I am biased to Robert Downey Junior.  Ever since \\"Less than Zero\\" when he played the out of touch with reality drug addict gone bad, I have been amazed at his acting skills.  I will say if you take Tony Stark from \\"Iron Man\\", give him a pipe and fill him with drugs, then send him back in time, you basically have the same character.  There isn't a lot of deviation from one to the other.  Damn, maybe Tony Stark smokes Heroine as well.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes, as always, is in the middle of solving a crime.  He is physically fit and tackles as many obstacles with his fist as he does his brains.  Dr. Watson is adeptly played by Jude Law who does an adequate job performing his sidekick duties.  Rachel McAdams simply has to be in a picture for me to love it.  The girl is flat out hot, and keeps your interest as the female lead of the story.  She as well doesn't sit back on her laurels, but has the ability to kick somebody's ass just like the guys.  Be warned to all the muggers who might try and take her purse in the alley.<br /><br />Setting the action aside the story is a little weak.  The bad guy dies in the beginning, then returns from the grave in an attempt to take over parliament.  I think that was his goal.  It was a little shaky on what exactly he was trying to accomplish.  I did fully get that he wanted everyone dead, who was not on his side.  In that capacity, he had invented a machine to distributed chemicals in order to kill a large body of people.  I wonder if he was going to sell this to the Middle East shortly after proving it worked.<br /><br />I think the reason this movie was enjoyable is completely based on the acting abilities of everyone involved and the wonderfully choreographed action sequences.  I loved the scenes where Sherlock Holmes would plan his physical assault on unsuspecting opponents down to each blow, and then follow through.  It made me feel as if I was as intoxicated as he was when the actual assault began.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you like action movies with good acting this is a great movie to see.  If you are interested in a detective movie with a great mystery you will be disappointed.  This is not your old Sherlock Holmes who did it version.  This is the kick your ass while I am wasted story, even if I have to sink an entire shipyard to do it.oxicated as he was when the actual assault began.

B00337KM2S|4.0|If there was ever a lonely life to lead, then this movie with George Clooney and a cast of others is right on. Clooney plays an executive who goes from city to city(with a heap of flyer miles to boot)and fires people from their jobs. To watch these parts of the movie is sobering to say the very least and then it gets downright impersonal when a new young upstart(Anna Kendrick) brings in an idea to do it via videocam; First of all, it was funky doing it in personal, now it got downright terrible. Quite a sobering movie. Clooney already knows the drill and the job, but he meets a lady(Vera Farmiga), whom he likes because she lives a similar life and feels that perhaps she's the one for him but come to find out she has her own separate life that slaps him in the face. The scene where he is coming from meeting her and he finds out he got the 10 Million Miles points and special pin makes you wonder if that was worth all that he put up with. The young lady that he pairs up with and had the good idea, hits the road because the job gets to HER(imagine that) but all in all, the movie is worth the accolades it deserves. I must also speak on the opening song performed by Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings. That alone sets the tone for the movie and is worth you checking out the group on You Tube. I am sorry they didn't get Best Picture but it was worth the nomination it received. One more thing. Jason Reitman, who is the director, is noteworthy and one to watch for because this was his second time coming up for an Oscar and he's pretty much the new kid on the block.
B002ZFQD04|3.0|I have been a fan of Madonna's for 20 years now and the one great thing I can say about Madonna is that she always puts on one hell of a show! She's also in fantastic shape for a 50 year old and can still move and dance around better than alot of 20 year olds. However, for me, this was just an \\"okay\\" concert. One reason being is that the focus of the concert is of course on her latest album \\"Hard Candy\\" which I found to be the worst Madonna album ever recorded. Timbaland is such an overrated producer. All of his stuff sounds the same. Sure, there are a couple of songs I enjoyed like \\"Heartbeat\\" but mostly I continue to ignore that cd. I will say though that seeing her perform some of these songs LIVE made me tolerate them a little more. I was genuinely entertained. Moving onto her other tracks, I would say the best live performance is \\"Vogue\\". It had a classic appeal to it like the way we all loved the song yet more modern and funky with the dancing. I do have to complain though about one of the last tracks listed on the dvd which is \\"Like a Virgin\\". Its very misleading on the track listing because that was not an official performance. That was Madonna taking a request from the audience and it was a cappella...but it was mostly song by the audience! It is so annoying to me when a singer makes the audience sing. Overall though, I will say again that Madonna puts on a fantastic show that will certainly entertain you. Its so much better than seeing a boring performer on stage just stand in front of a microphone for 90 minutes. Unlike her other concerts though, I won't be sticking this back in my dvd player repeatedly.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|I guess my expectations were too high, for a documentary coming from Eric Schlosser...  It is a must see... and will change the way you shop for your food... just by some of the images in the movie..  Alot of the topics discussed are pretty well known these days anyway, but still a good documentary if you have nothing else to do...

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|The movie: 4.5/5  Basically this is the first in a series of theatrical adaptations of the original Evangelion anime TV series. Some of the filler content of the TV series was trimmed off and the pacing was adapted to a theatrical release. For newcomers as well as Evangelion fans, this is a must-watch anime: newcomers won't have any trouble following the story due to the strong rewriting and newcomers will find the pacing fresh and not too slow but also not too fast.    Video quality: 5/5  Simply put, I was unable to discern any flaw in this beautiful transfer. Even banding, the enemy of every animated feature, is absent. Colors are spot-on, detail is clear and crisp, and the animation of the original series was completely reworked for this theatrical release. The Blu-ray is a faithful reproduction of what was shown in theaters.    Audio quality: 5/5  Simply stunning. This disc sports a powerful Japanese TrueHD 5.1 track that envelops you into a realistic listening area. Sound effects are clear and precise and dialog is well-balanced and clearly audible.  Moreover, it's a very, VERY welcome change to for once be able to listen to the original language track in high quality on a US released anime feature. Funimation, take note!    Extras: 2/5  Not a whole lot of extras but what is on the discs discusses how the team brought the original animation of the Evangelion TV series anime to the big screen and it shows clearly that a lot of love and work went into making this feature.    Overall: 4.5/5  Anime fans, fans of Evangelion and purists like me who like quality audio on the original language should add this to their basket post haste. The production values are astonishing for an anime feature and I was unable to detect any technical faults on this disc's transfer. The story was nicely condensed, trimming out superfluous material to leave only the core story and it's moving along at a steady pace. This one ranks at the top of my anime Blu-ray list as far as US releases are concerned! Media companies like Funimation who churn out series after series with mediocre quality (most of the time) and little to no regard for the original language track should take a few lessons from Bandai Visual. Don't let the rather high price tag scare you away ... this one is worth it!
B001UV4XWY|5.0|With Francis Lawrence's damn near perfect adaptation of Richard Matheson's horror classic \\"I Am Legend\\" and now Richard Kelly's stunning, Twilight Zone-like translation of the author's short story \\"Button, Button\\", we are at long last seeing an underappreciated, unjustly obscure horror/sci-fi/western author into mainstream film.  Better late than never--his friend Stephen King has enjoyed this success (for better or worse) since his writing took off with \\"Carrie\\".  Even that great film with Dennis Weaver, \\"Duel\\", enjoys only a fraction of the attention that King gets from simply penning his name on any film that comes around.<br /><br />\\"The Box\\" has a general air of disorientation, metaphysical confusion, and immanent doom that many of the original Twilight Zone episodes had (many written by Matheson himself).  Cameron Diaz is brilliant as Norma Lewis, a middle class mother who with a puzzling foot and and Arthur, a dedicated husband also brilliantly underplayed by James Marsden.  Living lives of quiet desperation and hard up for cash to ensure a future for their children, they seem perfectly ordinary--therefore ripe for the pickings of a man (Frank Langella) who shows up at their door with a box, guaranteeing them one million dollars if they press the clown-nose like button within.<br /><br />Langella's creepy, yet at times tender performance as Arlington Stewart, the \\"salesman\\" who most will undoubtedly think is the devil himself after things go awry, takes the cake.  He is not what he appears to be and yet he is also not what does *not* appear to be--the decision is ultimately the viewer's.  His \\"employers\\", whether they be God Himself and his angels or malevolent extraterrestrial entities testing the altruism of humanity in a kind of moral suicide mission, are certainly not happy with the human race.  The ideals of Christian love, exemplified best perhaps by Norma and her compassion for Stewart's hideous appearance are also counterbalanced by something more ominous that each viewer will have to figure out for themselves.  If one views the film as a moral fable solely, which would be sort of difficult considering the nosebleeds, the NASA component, etc, it would be thus: don't do something selfish for your own sake that will have a karmic rebound affect and immediately hurt another person.  This is a gorgeous movie and a sort of full color TZ episode to end all TZ episodes.  I'm sure Rod Serling would have loved it.  Finally, Richard Matheson is getting his due.  Unreservedly recommended.iewer will have to figure out for themselves.

B0026P3G12|4.0|What I found most different about this CD is that the choices of songs hit so many different genres. Most CD's have one theme that usually permeates the whole CD. With Susan Boyle, her song choices had no specific grouping but what she sang was beautiful each in its own specific way. I would recommend anyone who saw her story unfold and appreciated her voice, should buy this CD and enjoy it.
B0035KGWR2|5.0|This is currently the best selling album in Europe for the last two weeks.  As promised a little bit of everything.  A little more edgy than the debut album \\"This Is the Life\\", but absolutely delightful throughout. There are many highlights but \\"Troubled Soul\\" and \\"Your Time Will Come\\" are sublime with a lilting Celtic influence.  There's only one think better than listening to this album and that's listening to Amy live.  Catch her rendition of \\"Spark\\" for a special live recording that's available on YouTube, she is an incredible talent.
0307271862|1.0|I read this with high expectations given the reviews of other of his books. However the rambling nature and excessive amount of topics brought up in this book were totally disappointing. The judge is such a shambling and uninspiring character and doesn't seem to have much respect either for her profession or how to let police procedure work. I was surprised that if she was intimately involved with criminal justice how much her bumbling around in the crime scene would have tainted evidence. The female police waoman was by far a more interesting character but completely undeveloped. and unforgivably the author paints a flattering picture of Robert Mugabe. How disgusting...
B003DRWX9I|5.0|Can't say much more than what the other reviewers have already said.  Great record.  Slash really did well with this one and delivers some great rock tunes.  The vocalists he worked with did a great job.  Never cared much for a Maroon 5 album, but Adam Levine's work is one of my favorite tracks on this record.  Has it's own sound as well, doesn't sound like a rip off of a Guns record or a Velvet Revolver record.  Excellent work.  One of my favorite albums purchased this year.
B00319ECGU|5.0|I ordered this collection for our son in Az. He collects boxed older movies, and Clint Eastwood is one of his favorites, as is ours. Clint Eastwood puts his acting expertise into all his movies! Intense, moving, exciting, unpredictable,even funny sometimes,it would be great to see him in more movies besides directing them, which he is great at, outstanding actor in his time will always enjoy anything he acts in or directs.
B000BT99EI|5.0|I have just recently seen Batman Begins, I would not watch it for as long as i could remember although when The Dark Night released my wife insisted on seeing it because of it being one of Mr. Ledgers (rest in peace) last films I must say he did do quite an excellent portrayal of the Joker not Jack Nicholson but for the context of the movie he was perfect I dont think anyone could have done better although my main reason for writing this review is because Batman Begins is not rated R as it is posted for the listing of this movie here on Amazon im really not sure as to who should be addressed on this but they should correct this information because it is clearly a mistake.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|2012 is one of those movies that keeps you glued to your chair as you watch action scene after action scene fly in front of you.  By the time it ends, you are breathless and almost exhausted.<br /><br />Being based on the predicted natural disasters that appear to be happening now and supposed to crescendo to a world wide chaotic conclusion in 2012, this movie avoids the prophecies and religious ideologies attached to the date by many people.  It is strictly adventure - one man trying to save his family from what seems to be inescapable doom - that drags you along to the awesome conclusion.<br /><br />The computer graphics are out of this world.  The characters are portrayed as real humans and not super heros.  While some of the actions scenes stretch the limits of credibility, by the time you are watching them, you don't reallly care.  All you want to do is see the family reach safety.<br /><br />While young children might be intimidated by some of the scenes, the movie is outstanding for most age groups.  If you enjoy disaster movies, this is the one you do not want to miss!

B002ZG9788|4.0|When it was announced that a remake of the classic Clash of the Titans with Harry Hamlin was being made, I was quite enthusiastic, given the power of today's special effects and how it could bring to life the many creatures explored in the original. Now having seen it, I am firm in my estimation that the 2010 version is an interesting take on an old classic. Now before the numerous fans of the original gather to stone me in the street, I offer this reasoning for my assessment. The true power of a remake lies in how the movie goer defines the concept itself. One interpretation is that a remake should somehow \\"regurgitate\\" the original, but just provide some new polishing on it in terms of effects and visuals. However, I prefer a different understanding of the remake, where the film provides a re-envisioning of the original, while retaining some essential elements. The new \\"Clash of the Titans\\" fits this profile. I applaud the fact that the makers of this film were not afraid to take it into different directions. In doing so, what movie goers have with this film is a more condensed version that explores the inner turmoil of man rather than focusing centrally on the often childish inclinations of the Olympian gods. In effect, Perseus is more humanized by the fact that his existence is not so contingent upon the gods' favor, especially with his otherworldly father Zeus. Subsequently, the adventure he partakes in is more effectual for the audience since he grows as a person and leader with each step he takes in achieving his goals and fulfilling his purpose. Essentially, the stakes on the situation seemed so much more higher.  With the original, that type of growth, purpose, and gamble seemed absent since the viewer knew that Perseus would inevitably succeed since he had the favor of Zeus. Though the original version offers a more complicated and rich story, the minimalist approach exercised in the remake is still enough to entertain.    Aside from story analysis, the film does have fine performances by veteran actors Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes as Zeus and Hades, respectively. Neeson brings a very commanding presence to the king of the gods, and Fiennes really embodies the saying \\"something wicked this way comes\\" with his portrayal of Hades. Sam Worthington succeeds in his portrayal of Perseus, and the other cast and characters were handled well. Lastly, the special effects are stunning in the 2D version of the film.  Overall, I think that if a movie goer approaches this film with an open mind, he or she may be surprised by what will be seen. You decide.
6305076995|5.0|This is the first time I saw YES.  It was actually about four months later in San Antonio, Texas, but the same tour.    The boys were young and full of energy.    Although still a great band when this particular lineup plays together, this was when they were at their best.    I wish we could see a little more than this dvd offers in terms of song footage, however, this does justice to the actual show, just a little short.
0143038419|3.0|It was hard for me to get past the idea that the author goes on a spiritual journey with God, but does not believe that Jesus is the only way to GOD. In the bible, Jesus states that he is the way, the truth and the light, no one comes to the father except through him (John 14:6). The bible also states that, there is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death, Prov 14:12.     Thinking from a parents perspective, if there was another way to fulfill a plan (salvation in the case of Jesus), I would find it because I would not want to see my child suffer and die a horrible death like what happened on the cross. If there was another way to salvation, don't you think God (the author of the universe) would have found it instead of sending his son to die for us?
B002IR3PSC|4.0|Tull was past their prime, but just slightly.    Although some great film, just way too short.    Too bad we can't get the Thick as a Brick or the Passion Play tour with those songs/albums played in their entirety.
B002ZG9788|3.0|I was a big fan of the 1981 movie Clash of the Titans. It had everything I loved: action, excitement, Greek mythology! It was a great film for its time and still holds up at least somewhat today. Sure, the effects have aged, but that's to be expected.    It was also a movie that pushed me even more into my budding interest in Greek mythology; an interest which has continued to this very day. Heck, I got quite an interest in mythology in general and even took a course in it when I was in high school (and designed my own pantheon of gods for extra credit).    So I went to the new version with a certain set of expectations. I wanted to see gods, Medusa, Calibos, the Kraken and some good ole fashioned swords and sandals combat. Anything further, like a good story line and decent acting, were to be considered nice bonuses.    With those moderate exceptions in mind, this movie delivers quite well. Gods? Check. Medusa? Check. Calibos? The Kraken? Oh, definite check. Mind you, the gods are largely unnamed and don't do a lot, Medusa isn't as interesting as she was in the original film, Calibos goes by a different name in all but one sentence and the Kraken... well, actually still looks pretty impressively Kraken-esque.    The plot is pretty basic: Queen Danae (a name never mentioned in the movie, which sucked cause I used to know a girl with that name), gives birth to Perseus, the son of Zeus. Her husband is a bit irked by this and dumps her and her son into the sea. They're recovered but Danae is already dead. Perseus is raised by the fisherman who found them. The boy grows up to be a man played by Sam Worthington who watches the gods kill his adopted family, sees Hades threaten Argos and eventually gets caught up in a war between the men and the gods.    The plot is pretty basic, and frankly seems a bit more basic than it was in the original film. The presence of a Burges Meredith character is also sorely missed (though the owl, Bupo, puts in a brief appearance), as the replacement, Draco, handles Perseus' training a little too quickly to be satisfying. I also found Sam Worthington's performance to be less interesting than his performance in Avatar, and given how basic that was, that's saying something.    The effects are all that you'd expect from a modern CGI-heavy film. I saw it in 2-D as there wasn't any reason not to. Everything looked good, nothing looked overly fake. The giant scorpions were impressive.    Beyond that, the various characters were all essentially background dressing. Hades was somewhat interesting (though I could really do without him being portrayed as evil all the time. Hades was not evil), but not all that great. Zeus' armor was way too bright and looked very out of place for a Greek era, but the character himself was... well, somewhat interesting. None of the other gods even have speaking roles, beyond a couple words from Apollo, so there's really nothing there. All the Greeks except Draco and some mad guru who for all the world looks like he should be worshiping Krishna (he even has the third eye thing going on!), are pretty interchangeable.    Also at the end there's a very blatant setup for a sequel which could actually be interesting. I'd love to see Perseus going off and encountering other Greek heroes (perhaps an Argonauts film?), or even heroes from other mythologies. Imagine would could be done with a film showing him facing off against Gilgamesh and Enkidu!    I have a great sense that this film was originally supposed to be about a half-hour longer. There's several parts where it seems like there's scenes missing (how does Perseus get back out of the underworld?), and certain people who were clearly supposed to have speaking roles, like Alexander Siddig as Hermes, aren't really on screen at all. It has studio meddling all over it. I look forward to a director's cut that might restore some of these scenes and make for a better, more interesting film. What we have now isn't bad, but it could be so much, much better.    Oh, and for all you Skins fans out there, let me tell you now so you won't sit there wondering all movie like I did: yes, that's Nicholas Hoult as Eusebios.

B001NESPHC|5.0|This is an excellent album.  Melody has such an easy listening style with effortless singing and piano playing.  This music is only mildly jazzy, more a female crooner (late night with a glass of red wine and dreamy conversation).  Her musicians are also excellent and with true jazz style are given their time in the sun.  Highly recommended.
B002TZ3C6I|4.0|at the begining the book was really confusing, the reason why it gets 4 stars. but when you really get into the book it's really awesome!   you might wonder why I say it's confusing, i have my reason: when she sees the tracker she keeps calling him different names and she already knows what's gonna happen plus as readers you don't really know what's happening
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I purchased this item in March, 2010. When it was delivered it did have a hissing sound when there was no sound playing as other reviewers here have noted. The headphones also made a crackling noise on occassion that sounded like a short in a wire. The headphones worked fairly well for about a month but then the crackling noise became worse and worse. There seemed to be a short on both sides of the control box. Despite being handled with great care, the sound went out on one side and then both sides. I could hear a pulsing beeeping tone. By jiggling the wires about I could make the phone work but why put up with that? Beware of this problem and if you encounter it return the phones immediately for a patial refund. You can't return them if they break after 30 days unless Amazon makes an exception to their refund policy.    I solved my problem by purchasing a blue tooth microphone headset from Amazon (36 bucks) and combining it with a Sharper Image SHP 920 wireless headphone I bought on sale for 11 bucks at Menards. I did not need the phones at the time, but at that price I bought 2 pair. Those phones sell for around 25 bucks online. They work very well. They are great for hotel use because of the included multiple input jacks and they also include a microphone on the transmitter for computer use. Happy Gaming!
0670824399|5.0|Matilda is probably one of my top 5 books.  This book would inspire children to do well in school. But just like in Calvin & Hobbes you might get some mean children doing terrible pranks on adults. I would recommend this book to older elementary school kids that are looking for a good book to read.
B0036XN2L2|3.0|This CD ....it makes me very very sad. Don't get me wrong.....The Scorpions are my FAVORITE band of my life. I have met these guys,and I love them with all my heart. But this CD.....I cannot listen to it.I have tried to for 3 or 4 times and ended up in tears each time. It is their last CD! They are retiring after 30 some years.I know it might sound selfish from my end, but I do not want them to retire, I want to hear new music in the future from them...but sadly, they say this is their last one, and I cannot bear it. So in my selfishness...I'm rating this only a 3. Sorry guys.....I do believe Acoustica and Moment of Glory have to be a couple of my favorites, but not this one....this one is too painful...so sorry....
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I love this gamepad. I originally bought this game pad for use with World of Warcraft to try and make PVPing easier for a noob like me. Since quitting WOW I use it for borderlands which Im currently playing. This gamepad is pretty great for everything you would want it for. It's got plenty of buttons that are completely programmable. It has option to switch button mappings based on saved profiles which is fantastic if you want to assign different keystrokes to different keys based on the game youre playing. My favorite part of the controller is the thumb joystick though, because I originally started as a console gamer and so the thumbstick feels a lot more familiar to me for in game movement than the wasd keys do. The only things that I find as sort of pseudo-cons are that this pad has basically too many things going for it. The LCD panel is basically useless since it doesnt effectively control any background programs while you're playing whatever game you're playing(at least I havent figured it out yet). The buttons on the side of the joystick arent that easy to get to sometimes, but having the extra buttons is definitely useful. The best thing about this gamepad, especially if you are a laptop gamer is it's relatively small form factor. You can just put it in a backpack and play wherever you take your laptop! A lot more convenient than keyboard/gamepad hybrids like the merc stealth keyboard from ideazon which I bought before I bought this pad(and totally dont use anymore).
B00127RAJY|3.0|I have mixed feeling about the DVD... it definitely produces results, but I and several friends who have tried it have had a considerable amount of pain and soreness - mainly lower back, knees and ankles. I'm VERY careful to follow the correct form and do the modified moves where needed, but although I've felt an increase in strength and endurance, I can't seem to do the workout on a regular basis without considerable aches and pains. Doing a longer warm-up on my own before starting the DVD helps (brief warm-up on the DVD is no where near enough for me - same with cool down/stretching at end). Not sure if it's me or the routine - but I'm taking a break and trying the Yoga Meltdown instead.

0393312836|2.0|This version of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" opens with an historical controversy in the forward and introduction.  The forward is written by the author, Anthony Burgess, and tells his story of the initial publication of what he calls his prized novella.  Burgess claims that the U.S. publisher forced the exclusion of the twenty-first chapter, which added a psychological twist to the ending.  The publisher, in the introduction, then claims that dropping chapter twenty-one was merely a suggestion and not a condition of publication.  Regardless of how this actually played out originally, I think it's obvious by the end of this book that the additional final chapter in question would have been better off left on the cutting room floor.    This novel does have much to recommend it including a famous movie version, sans the added chapter twenty-one, and a reputation as a classic horror story.  Written in 1962 and intended as a dark vision of the future of mind control, it does work towards this purpose to a certain extent.  However, it is also an exercise in cryptography as much of the included slang is as indecipherable as it is obsequiously obfuscating.  Perhaps this was what it took forty years ago to get these descriptions of violence and sex to be acceptable to the publishing industry, although the film was still rated X.  The result is that much of the book reads as if it was in a foreign language, which while it provided added interest to the story for me will probably be off-putting to the more typical reader.    The appended chapter twenty-one actually detracts from the impact of the story in a weak attempt to turn it into a fable on the human condition.  It turns a fairly interesting psychological study of violence and destructiveness in the young into a simplistic fantasy.  This fantasy involves the false dichotomy between right and wrong in human behavior.  The implication being that maturity and social consciousness are determined by age and an evolution of individual thought processes that occurs somewhat naturally.  This elevates a very minor subsidiary effect on personality to an overriding importance that only wishful thinking can preserve.  The central character not only changes his point of view and approach to the world completely in the added final chapter, but he does this with no deterministic external nurturing event to spur him on towards change.    The result is that this amounts to a quaint fantasmagorical fable in which nature runs rampant over nurture.  The moral of the story being that all individual actions depend solely on internal motivations, even in this extreme case where external events seem to drive the entire storyline.  This book is much more effective as an allegory without the addition of the twenty-first chapter, which is probably why the publisher, and Stanley Kubrick in his film version, quite correctly decided it was best left out.  It appears to be a clear case of an author not being able to see the forest for the trees and yearning for the addition of a legacy ending that detracts at least as severely from the story for the reader as it adds some warm cuddly nostalgia for him.  Editors and publishers apparently do serve a purpose sometimes and this updated version of an old story proves that point definitively.
B000001DTM|5.0|This album is one of the top notch albums by U2 ever. Awesome singing by Bono, guitar work and terrific music. A must buy for anyone who loves music and U2 in particular. One thing which i would want to confirm with other colleagues who own this album is did you notice the gaps in the middle of some of the songs like Whos GOnna Ride Your Wild Horses, So Cruel, One, Even Better Than The Real Thing and The Fly. I have two copies of Achtung Baby and both of them have this issue. I would like to confirm whether this is a recording issue or is it a feature of the songs. Thank you.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|This is a wonderful story of a second chance at love. I was a little concerned that I wouldn't like it, I knew there was some business about Anne rejecting Frederick Wentworth at the persuading of her late mother's good friend Lady Russell, but as it turned out I love it. I would have liked to have seen Anne Elliot (Sally Hawkins) with a little less severe hair style, but I thought Sally did a wonderful job bringing Anne to life.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Captain Wentworth goes to Anne in the city of Bath and he tells her of a rumor that Admrial Croft had heard, Anne was to marry a Mr. William Elliot and they would live at Kellynch Hall. Admrial and Mrs. Croft (Frederick's sister) are renting Kellynch Hall and if the rumor is true they would have to move. When Anne tells Frederick the Admrial is \\"...utterly misinformed\\" Rupert Penry-Jones as Frederick Wentworth says \\"Misinformed? Utterly?\\" his face changed, it was just as clear as day that he was smiling at her. Rupert was a great choice for Frederick and he's nice to look at too.<br /><br />Anthony Head as Anne's father was pretty pompous and I wanted to smack him in the head, but he was fairly true to the written Sir Walter Elliot in the book.

B002NXPTDK|5.0|I am very impressed with this cd. Although I like day and nite, it wasn't until I heard the pursuit of happiness that convinced me to buy the cd. I can listen to this cd from start to finish. Kid Cudi broke a new mold in Hip Hop. Everything about this cd is unique. What I appreciate the most is the pure honesty of his lyrics. He is inviting the listener into his world. He expresses his dreams and vulnerabilties. This is something I haven't heard in Hip Hop for awhile. It's always good to hear a true solid hip hop album that isn't about money, jewelry, cars, and girls. This is the trend that mainstream hip hop is setting and it's really irritating. It's like they continue to beat a dead horse. It's no longer relative to what's going on in the average hip hop fan's life. We are experiencing a recession where people are losing their jobs and homes. Then u turn on the radio or watch a video and see all the flashy wannabe's throwing the riches in ur face. So to me \\"Man on the Moon\\" is truly refreshing. This album delivers great production and lyrics. He takes u on a journey into who he is and it's great story. That's another thing I miss about real hip hop music the storytelling. A real musician knows how to paint a perfect picture thru song and Cudi captures a vivid portrait. I definitely can appreciate that he's not afraid to admit that he's a dreamer. This cd has become an instant classic for me.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie has universal appeal, I can't think of anyone who wouldn't like it! Based on a true story this family opens itself up to help an underprivledged young man that most would probably turn away. With the love and support of the Toohey family the homeless boy not only excels in sports but achieves academic success. As a mother, it is what we all dream of for our kids that with the right amount of love and support their dreams, talents and ambitions will be realized. As a Raven's fan, it isn't hard to support Michael Ohr the now Baltimore Raven then homeless struggling youth, The Blind Side story is based upon. Sports guys will like it, Moms, Dads, Grandparents and their kids will all get something out of this story. It is a story that is timeless and should find a home in everyone's movie collection.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I'm sure stepping into the shoes of John Williams is enough to give anybody a case of the jitters... However, Doyle manages with such grace and elegance that one wouldn't notice. \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" is not just a great score, it's a masterpiece of classical music that I'm sure Doyle is very proud of. Unlike his successor (Hooper) Patrick Doyle chose to take the Potter series an entirely different direction with a sobering and dramatic work. While tracks like \\"Harry in Winter\\" pull at the heartstrings, \\"The Yule Ball\\" and it's like are pure classical bliss. Also keep your ears peeled for Doyle's reworking of \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" which sounds very akin to a Bohemian/gypsy tune mixed with a gothic flair.
B00006JQU1|5.0|I have listened to many recordings of these pieces. However, Mrs. Podger is one of the best. Her sound is beautiful and her interpretation is sublime. For instance, listen to the D Minor Giga and be mesmerized. Mrs. Podger capability of delivering a warm sound and convincing staccato is indeed the most outstanding features of her interpretation. Summarizing, any Bach's lover should have these CD's in his/her collection.
B002TKFEZK|1.0|Do not buy the Kindle edition of this book.<br /><br />This book depends on understanding the authors' visual aids --- charts, graphs, tables, and the Kindle makes them almost impossible to read.<br /><br />For example, in Table 1.1 the authors define the terms they will use later in the book.  In the accompanying prose they say that they have have put the definitions at the beginning of the book --- in Table 1.1 --- rather than in an appendix because understanding the definitions is critical to understanding the rest of the book.<br /><br />This is unfortunate, because I found the table almost impossible to read.  In this context \\"almost impossible\\" means swapping glasses until I found the ones with the best reading segment (I use bifocals), cleaning the lenses, standing under a bright light, then rotating the screen until I found an angle at which I could read the small print.  By the time I'd done all that, my focus had shifted from the content of the book to overcoming the annoyances of reading it on the Kindle.<br /><br />I've heard this is a great book.  I want to read it.  So, I'm going to buy it in hard back.  The Kindle version was a waste of my money.  Don't let it be a waste of yours.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I have read most of Kinsella's books and this is by far my favorite. Like all of her books nit is a fun breezy read, but i found this one funnier and more heart felt. I was literally laughing out loud for pages at a time and found myself much more emotionally invested that expected. The character of Sadie (the ghost) is so refreshing, and I'll admit that was a bit apprehensive about reading this when I found out there was a ghost, but I am so glad that didn't stop me!
B00383YC2S|5.0|Compared to Psychedelices this album has almost perfect composition, the tracks and style are thoroughly well done throughout the album. The artists ability to pull these unknown french electronic music artists together and create a work as good as this is impressive. This album is quality, and for electronic music fans this definitely worth listening to. Her live shows sounded WAY BETTER for this album also!
0307463745|3.0|This book is formatted as a series of short essays.  While this was good for creating salient topics, the book reads too much like a manifesto and not in a format that is readily usable by the reader.  The book would have had more meaning if the authors had articulated more of their own story of going from obscurity to being a thought leader in the technology industry.  In this sense, the point they're trying to make is less interesting than the story behind it.

0312427573|2.0|Prior to actually reading it, my understanding of Bonfire was that it's one of those \\"must reads\\" for any self proclaimed American bibliophile because it is a landmark piece of cultural satire.  Now that I've read it I can say that in no way does this book live up to ANY of its hype.<br />Although this is not the first time this has happened, it never ceases to irritate me when I walk away from a book with no actual \\"walk aways\\", ie, \\"what a GREAT story!\\" or \\"did not see that twist coming\\", or \\"I need a moment alone...those sex scenes were ridiculous!\\"  After finish Bonfire, my only thought was, \\"ok, so what?\\"  The story takes place in NYC circa the 80's.  The focal character is a quintessential, self made yuppie, Wall Street bonds trader whose life comes crumbling down after he's involved in an unfortunate late night encounter in the Bronx, apparently the borough from hell during this decade.  What ensues is a strange smattering of social clich&eacute;s with little cultural context (I would've loved more references to the political and pop culture landscapes of the time) and zero character development.  I suppose you could draw some parallels with greed of Wall Street then to the all out corruption of Wall Street today but when the author seemingly has no opinion about it, there is nothing the reader can do with it.<br />In short, this is 685 pages you could be spending elsewhere.
B0034EEE2E|5.0|I never quite got Beach House, I respected them, but it just wasn't my thing. A while back I happened to tune into Jimmy Fallon and caught a performance of Zebra. I had to have the album! I bought it as soon as it came out and it's still in constant rotation on my mp3 player. There are a couple tracks that don't shine as brilliantly as the rest, but over all a well put together album. It's more poppy than past works, yet still breaks from mold enough to keep one interested. Give it a try. I haven't found a better album this year!
B0039OGGVQ|4.0|Having recorded five albums with Guns N' Roses, two with Slash's Snakepit and two with Velvet Revolver, Slash finally unleashes his first solo album, with a motley collection of players. \\"Slash\\" (2010) features a cast of newer cats such as Myles Kennedy (Alter Bridge), and Adam Levine (Maroon 5) and veterans such as Ian Astbury (the Cult) and Ozzy Osbourne.<br /><br />\\"Slash\\" is a highly diverse album that should have something for everyone, as the album doesn't have a lot of repetition, as each song is a unique collaboration between Slash and the guest artist featured on the track. Bassist Chad Chaney (Jane's Addiction) and John Freese (A Perfect Circle, Guns N' Roses, Nine Inch Nails) round out the band.<br /><br />1. Ghosts (featuring Ian Astbury). A great mid-tempo opener that wouldn't have been out of place on the Cult's \\"Electric\\" (1987) album. Great to see Slash and Izzy rock once more.<br /><br />2. Crucify the Dead (featuring Ozzy Osbourne). A bluesy, haunting vintage Ozzy-rocker that really wouldn't sound out-of-place on any of his albums. Although Slash has denied it, with lyrics like \\"A loaded gun jammed by a rose, the thorns are not around your head, your ego cursed you till you bled,\\" it's hard not to believe this song isn't about Axl.<br /><br />3. Beautiful Dangerous (featuring Fergie). The album takes a real left-turn with this song which sounds a bit like the band Garbage. When I first heard that Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas would be singing on this album, I was not impressed, to say the least. Seemed like a totally lame idea--an obvious attempt at creating a cross-over hit. That said, \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" totally rocks. Fergie actually has a powerful voice that fits the song really well. The song has a great hook and should be an obvious choice to use as a single.<br /><br />4. Back from Cali (featuring Myles Kennedy). Not bad, but not great either. A typical bluesy rocker from Slash that sounds like one of the more forgettable songs from a Snakepit album. Kennedy is a strong singer, but this is sort of a middle-of-the-road rocker that sort of meanders and doesn't really get off the ground.<br /><br />5. Promise (featuring Chris Cornell). I've always wanted to see Slash collaborate with Chris Cornell and I am very pleased with the results. This song is a little reminiscent of \\"Do You Know My Name,\\" the title song from \\"Casino Royale.\\" \\"Promise\\" doesn't grab hold of you right away; rather it builds up with its solid groove and infectious hook.<br /><br />6. By the Sword (featuring Andrew Stockdale). Since this features the singer from Wolfmother, it should come as little surprise that it sounds very Zeppelin-esque. A strong, bluesy rocker that doesn't make for a bad first single.<br /><br />7. Gotten (featuring Adam Levine). Much like with the Fergie song, it seemed pretty lame that Slash would want to record a track with a pop-singer like Adam Levine. Another obvious attempt at a cross-over hit, \\"Gotten\\" is actually much better than one might think. It certainly has more soul than most adult-contemporary tripe that's popular today. This is actually a song that both GN'R fans and soccer moms could go for.<br /><br />8. Doctor Alibi (featuring Lemmy Kilmeister). Not at all surprisingly this one sounds a lot like Motorhead. Maybe not up there with \\"Ace of Spades,\\" but \\"Doctor Alibi\\" is short, sweet and definitely rocking.<br /><br />9. Watch this Dave (featuring Dave Grohl and Duff McKagan). A song featuring alumni from both Nirvana and Guns N' Roses? No, that can't be. Won't there be a rip in the space-time-continuum or something? Apparently not. \\"Watch this Dave\\" is a good jam with strong instrumental fire-power that fans of Slash should dig.<br /><br />10. I Hold On (featuring Kid Rock). As expected this sounds a bit like updated Lynyrd Skynyrd. Neither Kid Rock nor Slash's greatest accomplishment ever, but solid.<br /><br />11. Nothing to Say (featuring M Shadows). A touch of speed-metal with a classicSabbath riff. Pretty heavy and a good counter-weight to the Levine song.<br /><br />12. Starlight (featuring Myles Kennedy). Maybe nothing ground-breaking, but a pretty mid-tempo rocker none-the-less. Definitely a cut above most generic ballads.<br /><br />13. Saint is a Sinner Too (featuring Rocco Deluca). Probably the most off-beat song on the album, this rather haunting, low-key song slowly builds up. Features some of the most exquisite playing on the album.<br /><br />14. We're All Gonna Die (featuring Iggy Pop). As its hedonistic, nihilistic, but amusing title might suggest, this balls-out rocker is Iggy at his best. A perfect closer.<br /><br />While Slash didn't attempt to push the envelope creatively the way his former colleague Axl Rose did with (the stronger) \\"Chinese Democracy\\" (2008) \\"Slash\\" is still a solid collection of songs that, while not earth shattering, should please his fans and rockers in general. \\"Slash\\" is the type of album that you can play over and over again and rock or mellow-out to with a six pack, or as Slash might prefer, a bottle of Jack.12.

B001OQCV2O|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie - especially for its special effects.  It was not what I expected and kept us guessing. It was a good light entertainment which is hard to come by these days.  It was much more than I expected.  I was also pleased with the ease of ordering it and the fast delivery.  It came a week earlier than I expected it to.  My grandchildren also enjoyed it and I did not mind at all seeing it again.  Seeing it on blu-ray really made for fantastic viewing.

They go through many tough times, and the twist at the end of the movie depicts how strong love can be and what one is willing to do to be by the side of their soul mate.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|Definitely worth the $17 or so dollars for me.  being able to block out incidental light and focus on your subject is very helpful for a new photographer like myself.  There was some contention when I bought whether it worked backwards, and the answer is yes and no.  The hood fits on the lens in the backward position securely, but the grips that hold it in place do not hold in a way that lets you manual focus with it on.  You will have to autofocus or take it off.  Manual focus in the forward position works just fine, and it is not likely to fall off the lens in either position.<br /><br />$17 seems excessive for a piece of plastic, but you are paying for the result, not the materials.
0307474275|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is an intriguing mystery novel about the death of a curator Jacques Sauni&egrave;re and solving the puzzles of a secret he left behind. Robert Langdon, a professor of religious symbology at Harvard University, along with Sauni&egrave;re's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu, try to solve the mystery of the secret that Sauni&egrave;re had written on his body before he died. Throughout the book they must be very deceitful and tricky because they have people following them, but must not reveal the secret they try to solve because the murderer of Sauni&egrave;re, Salis, is also after the same thing and Langdon is one of the highest murder suspects. Written on his body was a secret code regarding the Holy Grail, once you read the book you will find out what that is if you are unaware.<br /><br />I would highly recommend that you read the epilogue because only there is it where the location of the Grail. Langdon only realizes the location after Marie Chauvel, Sophie's grandmother, recites the poem:<br />\\"The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.<br />The blade and chalice guarding o'er Her gates.<br />Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies.<br />She rests at least beneath the starry skies.\\" (Brown 482)<br /><br />Also, it may be true that some of the teachings of the religions in this novel are not facts, but I believe it was not to be based on any religion to insult another on purpose. It is an exciting and suspenseful book and just try not to focus on the religious thing being said, simply the astounding journey to reveal the secret no one was to know about.<br /><br />As you can see, I enjoyed reading this book very much. It had a wonderful plot and i found learning about their religion of the one goddess was very intriguing because I had never heard of anything like it before. Also, I thought the book was well put together bouncing from person to person in each different chapter instead of mixing it all together. That helped me a lot to not get confused and know who I'm reading about. I think my favorite part had to be when Silas finds Langdon, Sophie, and Teabing, a man helping them solve the mystery. At that point, you have no idea what's going to happen! It had to be the most suspenseful part for me. Would their plans be ruined? Would he get what he was venturing for? Read the book and you will find out!<br /><br />Although, I do have to say there were a couple of things I didn't like. First of all, the typical love seen between two people in the end, you can probably guess who, but I don't want to ruin it. I simply think it has been over played and is in almost every mystery book I have read. Though, that is just little so it did not affect my opinion about the book. Second, even thought it was interesting to read about the religion, I think it should have been a secret based off of something else that wouldn't have so much controversy about the reason behind the book. So there aren't too many down sides to the book, the positive over powers them.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, but to just remind the reader to focus on the plot, not the teachings of the religion. This book was not made to inform you of any religion, its a novel, not a history book!<br /><br />-Miyah Dunlapbe when Silas finds Langdon, Sophie, and Teabing, a man helping them solve the mystery.

B002ZG977Y|4.0|I thought this was a very decent remake and great tribute to the 1981 classic. I loved the special effects, the action, and the suspense. Some things are different than the original, but it still has the same basic storyline. The human son of Zeus, Perseus loses his family because of Hades. When Hades threatens the city of Argos by releasing the Kraken, Perseus and his team decides to seek the Stygian Witches in hopes of figuring out a way to kill the Kraken. Along the way, they must deal with giant scorpions, befriend a race of Djinn, and try kill Medusa. If you love epics and Greek mythology, you will love CLASH OF THE TITANS!!!

B003NHRIUW|3.0|It's just another stereotypical teenage drama movie. Everybody is so melodramatic, that it's actually funny. This movie goes all over the place; one minute, Miley Cyrus loves her new boyfriend, and the next, she's mad at him, and then goes back to loving him...it's crazy! Cyrus plays Veronica \\"Ronnie\\" Miller, who is rebellious and forced to spend time with her dad and brother. (This is kinda important; she used to play the piano, but ever since her parents split up, she stopped playing) During her time with daddy, she finds sea turtle eggs, and decides to help save them from raccoons. The last thirty minutes is when you will need your tissues. If you keep a very open mind, you might like THE LAST SONG!!!
0441017177|4.0|Alastair Reynolds made a name for himself writing dark, violent, hard-edged sci-fi set in a deeply-textured, gritty universe, centering on brutal choices made by deeply flawed people under harrowing circumstances. You might think a novel that revolves around guilt and vengeance, begins with a mass murder and then moves on to vastly greater atrocities would fit easily into his oeuvre ... but it doesn't. Despite wanton slaughter, intense space battles, multiple assassination attempts, several shootouts, more space battles, and even the threat of human extinction, HOUSE OF SUNS is an almost-light-hearted romantic heroic space opera murder mystery. Really.<br /><br />Six million years ago, a young woman named Abigail Gentian used her family resources to grow 999 adult human bodies -- roughly half of them male, none of them from her own DNA -- and implanted them with all of her memories. She intended each of these \\"shatterlings\\" to travel the galaxy in perpetuity, acting as a communication system and collective memory for planet-based human colonies and empires that would otherwise fall gradually into isolation. Since each of the shatterlings is -- or at least was -- Abigail, they shared the same desire. She also decreed that her shatterlings would come together once every 200,000 years -- roughly enough time to make a circuit of the galaxy at relativistic speeds -- to share memories and renew their common identity.<br /><br />It was at one of these gatherings that the murderers struck. Fortuitously, shatterlings Campion and Purslane were running late and missed the attack. Campion, a male shatterling, is a good-hearted nonconformist reminiscent of Reynolds' Conjoiner Nevil Clavain. Purslane, a female shatterling, is, in violation of Gentian tradition, Campion's lover and a bit of a bad grrrl. The couple readily take up the challenge of determining who has attacked the Gentian line and why.<br /><br />As I suggested above, HOUSE OF SUNS is much broader in its strokes and pulpier in its approach than Reynolds readers are accustomed to. Still, readers who are drawn to Reynolds because of his intensity, his attention to detail, and his attraction to morally ambiguous figures and choices will find that these qualities are not absent, only muted. The result is a read that is considerably more entertaining and engaging than, say, PUSHING ICE, but not nearly as dark and deep as, say, CHASM CITY.<br /><br />Although HOUSE OF SUNS is in some sense a sequel to the novella \\"Thousandth Night,\\" it is not necessary to read the novella to enjoy the novel ... although those who did enjoy the novella will be pleased with the novel. N.B.: There are a number of small inconsistencies between the novel and the novella, the most glaring of which involves a character who died heroically in the novella and yet is still alive in the novel ... until he again dies heroically, albeit in an entirely different context.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a good but not outstanding novel by one of the best authors writing sci-fi today.h than Reynolds readers are accustomed to.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|Another amazing movie from Terantino! Brad Pitt's character is one of the most fun to watch, and for as action-packed as the movie is, it is very funny as well. Not good for kids, but very good movie!
B002OHDRF2|1.0|This isn't a real movie. There's no storyline, just a bunch of scenes that appear to lurch toward no conclusion whatsoever. No two plot points match, no human motivation appears to animate this cast of losers. No effort at all was expended on anything beyong stealing your money and wasting your time.    The unfathomable star power of Christian Bale, whose last credible performance was the lead in Empire of the Sun, was exploited to the hilt here. Bale has evolved perfect mastery of two acting modes, and only two: incoherent muttering and incoherent screaming.    If making this dull, stupid movie is the best people can do, Metal deserves to win.
143350393X|5.0|Truly an awesome product. Best Bible I have ever owned. I enjoy studying the thorough notes as well as reading the articles included that cover basic Theology of the New and Old Testaments, Apologetics and some commentaries, not to mention the fluidity of the literal ESV Translation - very poetic and natural -  (I come from an NIV reading non denominational  background. I currently work in a Baptist ministry that loves the KJV. The ESV translation resides harmoniously between the two). The updated maps and timelines are impressive as well. As a Christian who has been blessed to be able to make a living ad serve in full-time ministry at a church, this Bible is definitely a great durable educational tool for ministry. It is embarrassingly hard to take it out of the home or office because it is such a beautifully crafted book that it pains me to think that it will one day look tattered and well used. No joke, this Bible is beautiful inside and out. Great workmanship!

1591843162|3.0|My original review can be found at: [...]<br /><br />The best summary of the message of Linchpin can be found on page 174:<br /><br />\\"You must become indispensable to thrive in the new economy. The best ways to do that are to be remarkable, insightful, an artist, someone bearing gifts. To lead. The worst way is to conform and become a cog in a giant system.\\"<br /><br />This is, at some level, rather obvious, of course. Seth spends a lot of time explaining the gift economy and the lizard brain and what he means by making art. And all of this is pretty good stuff. But what it all comes down to is this: If you want to succeed as an employee, as an employer, as a person, you need to stand out from the crowd by exceeding expectations and giving freely your best work, even if less will do. Hardly earth-shattering stuff, but worth repeating.<br /><br />A problem Seth has with his books is that he rarely tells you how he thinks you can achieve the very high bars he sets. Just that you need to meet them. Somehow. This is a problem that Seth himself mentions in Linchpin:<br /><br />\\"One of my favorite negative reviews of my book Tribes: 'Godin doesn't explain how to go about doing the actual hard groundwork of leadership. He makes it sound like anyone with an idea and  a cell phone can rally thousands of people to their cause in minutes if they just realize it's not hard'. My response: Telling people leadership is important is one thing. Showing them step by step precisely how to be a leader is impossible.\\"<br /><br />Linchpin works the same way. He tells you that *being indispensable* is important, and why, but stops short of telling you how. That would be impossible. Which makes Linchpin much more of a \\"get off your butt and do something\\" inspirational-style book than a \\"here's a bunch of things you can do to make your life better\\" self-help book.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I deliberated long and hard before buying this (and when I did, suffered the nuisance of getting a counterfeit set, which the seller graciously took back and refunded my money), but when I got ahold of it, I was stunned.  Bear in mind, I haven't listened to the remastered stereo set, so my point of comparison is the '87 cds, but here's my take:    Please Please Me, With the Beatles, A Hard Day's Night, Beatles for Sale:  Since the '87 cds were already in mono, no major surprises, but the remastering is exquisite.  Some of the less famous songs sound much more powerful--Little Child, the rhythm section really stands out; Not a Second Time sounds stinging; Boys, always a great track, now detonates; and my favorite songs from these albums--Please Please Me, A Hard Day's Night, I Should Have Known Better, Every Little Thing-sound better than I've ever heard them.  I've never appreciated Ringo so much--to take just one example, it's impossible listening to Not A Second Time to acknowledge what an extraordinary sense of timing he had.     Help:  Amazing.  As much as I love Help, You're Gonna Lose That Girl, and Ticket to Ride, what really stands out is how much better songs like It's Only Love, Tell Me What You See, and You Like Me Too Much sound.  Those three songs aren't great, as Beatles songs go, but stereo really did them a disservice.  They sound much better in mono.    Rubber Soul:  At this point, I'll stop ransacking my thesaurus for adjectives.  The guitar solos on Drive My Car and Nowhere Man are incredible (oops, there's another adjective); Think for Yourself, You Won't See Me, I'm Looking Through You, and What Goes On all sound so much gritter, more rhythm and blues than they do in stereo.    Revolver:  Very different from stereo, and much better in my opinion.  Taxman, Got to Get you into My Life, Love You Too, Dr. Robert, and I Want To Tell You (one of my favorites) are particular stand-outs--again, much grittier and powerful than stereo.  I'll dissent fromsome other reviewers and state that I even prefer Tomorrow Never Knows in mono--Ringo's drumming is so wonderful, and it's so perfect front and center.    Sg't Pepper:  The biggest difference.  Stand-outs for me are Getting Better, Lovely Rita, and particularly Good Morning/Good Morning, which rocks incredibly hard.  Again, I even prefer a Day in the Life in mono--it sounds so focused, almost like a four-piece band playing their hearts out, despite the orchestral accompaniment--and Ringo's drumming--I can't emphasize this enough, you can't begin to appreciate him till you've heard the Beatles in mono.    Magical Mystery Tour:  Sounds good, but not a dramatic difference to my ears.    The White Album:  Fascinating differences--some surprising songs sound much better in mono--including Long, Long, Long of all songs.  I particularly like Paul's singing on I'm So Tired, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps--so much more apparent on mono.      The Mono Masters:  Slow Down, Bad Boy, I'm Down, Paperback writer,  Revolution, and a number of other songs were really done a disservice in stereo.  They sound so much more powerful in mono.

B002R5V7MG|5.0|Mahler, symphony 1<br /><br />Gustavo Dudamel conducted the Mahler symphony slower than anyone I've heard since Klaus Tennstedt's Chicago performance in 1991.  I don't put great importance on the speed of a performance, but this was slow, almost to the point of worrying me that it would stumble (langsam aber nicht schleppen as Mahler frequently warned).<br /><br />Then, a bit to my surprise, I started to hear things I had not fixed on in other recordings of Mahler's First:  the slower pace seemed to accentuate the waltz-like (Laendler) aspects, especially in the third movement.<br /><br />Dudamel's conducting style sometimes reminded me of Bernard Haitink--with a certain degree of \\"jerkiness.\\"  But his enthusiasm, bouncing, and passion for the music was reminiscent of Lenny Bernstein.<br /><br />It was an enjoyable performance, and I plan to revisit it in the future.<br /><br />Adams, City Noir<br /><br />Where the Mahler Titan felt like a slow, at times dancing walk through the forest, City Noir seemed a fast nighttime taxi ride through the city.  There were many passing images, but they were too fleeting to make out what they were.  Sometimes the music sounded like a movie soundtrack (especially \\"detective movies\\" of the forties and fifties) but without discernable melodies or harmonies, and pursued by a constant feeling of nervousness.<br /><br />The third movement brought to mind Arthur Honneger's Pacific 231, but Adams' locomotive had trouble moving down the tracks.<br /><br />Now, for balance it should be remembered that Mahler's music was at first disliked by many critics and audiences simply because it was too different from what they had been accustomed to.  People a century ago simply expected music to behave along the lines of exposition, development, and recapitulation.  Perhaps much as Mahler's music did not \\"behave as expected,\\" John Adams' music is hard for us to appreciate.  To me, it felt like a nighttime hurried taxi ride through the city, but maybe I'm just not ready for it yet.
B002RAREAK|3.0|There is no question that there has been a huge lack of really good albums this year in R&B. Most of the focus has been with R&B music buyers on Michael Jackson's catalog due to his death, or to other acts like Beyonce' & Rihanna, who've made very weak albums. For Usher, he hasn't had it very well the past couple of years. Not only did he deal with a heartbreaking divorce from his ex-wife Tameka Foster, he also had just like so many of us dealt with the devistating death of Michael Jackson, which Usher devoted heart and soul performed like others such as Mariah Carey and Lionel Richie sang at his publicized memorial service last year. Now, he has tried to make a new attempt of scoring back onto the top of the charts, but it doesn't feel like he's hit the home run.<br /><br />Usher's Raymond Vs. Raymond is his first album since his divorce with Tameka Foster. The album for Usher is more like a lackluster taste of what his music has shown this past year into this year. I wasn't fully impressed wit the early singles from the record which got released back in the Fall of last year: Papers, There Goes My Baby, and Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home) with the thought of thinking would the album feel like mixed baggage. The collection of songs remains less-than-enticing if he was trying to deliver the way he had scored on Confessions. The other songs don't fare as well either on songs like O.M.G. which his collaboration with Black Eyed Peas member Will.I.Am tries to have a take similar to what The Black Eyed Peas made last year with I Gotta Feeling. The other songs like Lil' Freak with Nicki Minaj whom worked with Mariah Carey on the now-cancelled Angels' Advocate record for Mariah which was supposed to have been released last month. Overall, the collection of songs for Usher feels like it is not very strong, nor has he delivered a definitive punch in making his record score big.<br /><br />All in all, Usher's Raymond Vs. Raymond just isn't a strong album for die hard Usher fans young and old. Although Usher has gone through a lot publicly, he has a stepping stone for a fresh start. I really think that Usher should come out with a better record for his next work, and try to not deliver something that he feels like he is weighed down. Hopefully his next album will be better than Raymond Vs. Raymond deeply showed, and that was just a waste of papers.<br /><br />Album Cover: C+<br /><br />Songs: C 1/2-<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Mastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: Cugh Usher has gone through a lot publicly, he has a stepping stone for a fresh start.

0307463745|5.0|Quite possibly.     Perhaps not the best for existing, large, command and control organisations, although they could learn a lot from it (but probably won't want to), but certainly the best for small organisations and anyone wanting to start one. I won't go into why, because there's just too much good material and not enough room here to do that (you'll have to buy the book).      But I will give some minor content suggestions (because there's so few they'll fit). The \\"Good Enough Is Fine\\" advice should over-ride \\"Build Half A Product, Not A Half-Assed Product\\", in other words, \\"good enough\\" and incremental improvement is enough to start with, don't hang back from starting just because you haven't trimmed your product down to perfect size: let it be a little \\"half-assed\\" and podgy, and get it out.     Second minor suggestion is in regard to \\"Don't Scar On The First Cut\\": yes, don't create a policy for something that's only occurred once, that's overkill; but, even before then, examine your own prejudices, is what has occurred really 'wrong'? To my mind, the example, 'someone wearing shorts', not only doesn't require a dress code, it isn't even wrong, so get over it.     The other thing is that the book doesn't solve the problem of making money from distributing your knowledge online, that's still a dilemma. These guys (the authors) have managed to sell software that helps them manage the business of selling software(! - which comes first?) But how many businesses are like theirs except NOT financially viable (providing a least a living income)? I don't know, however, I suspect it's the majority.     Anyway, this is a great book, liberating, and a breath of fresh air in the business world. I don't know about other people, but it certainly speaks for what I'd want in my business and of the kind of business I'd want to be part of.     For a later version, I'd like a bit on how they share the income in their organisation, not just the ideas. I hope their sharing of income is as enlightened as their other practices.
B000SXLL8O|5.0|I don't know what happened to them.... Jonny Buckland's guitar playing on this record was outstanding on this record, but all the records following this one really weren't guitar driven at all. So naturally, as a guitarist I like this record most. His tone is soooo killer on it and all the lead lines are perfect. Guitar playing aside, this is an all around great record, songwriting, musicianship... all of it. Definitely worth $5 and WAY more than that!

As much as I would love an album full of Blues riffs and shredding guitar I really think she's showing another side of her music capabilities. That is providing something for everyone with great melodies and catchy hooks while throwing in her amazing guitar abilities! She is an OUTSTANDING guitarist and has a surprisingly good voice. Lastly I can see how people would compare this album to Avril Lavigne with an edge and maybe even Kelly Clarkson but Carrie Underwood!!?? I don't see that comparison one bit! Carrie Underwood is a very good Country vocalist who thrives on pop/country ballads and mid-tempo songs. I have never heard a Carrie Underwood song with shredding guitar or any sense of a blues feel to it. Anyways I love the album and I can't wait for her next one!!
B000FSL9KM|5.0|This CD is great.  It has a lot of soft rock songs that are good and even some early R&B such as the Comodors.  I really like Eva Cassidy's version of \\"Fields of Gold.\\"  I think this one is worth buying for any fan of soft rock or 70's music.  Not all of the songs are from that decade, but a lot are.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|I love this movie! They presented the songs in a new unique way without destroying those aspects that made them great to begin with. The visuals in this movie are equally stunning. I often find myself hearkening back to them.
0399250395|4.0|Our two-year-old loves this book, but we wish we had been the ones to open in the first time (rather than him \\"helping\\" us) because some of the parts can stick and will need a bit of gentle persuasion to get everything working properly. Love the story and the artwork, and the pop-ups operate differently on every page so the interest remains high. Recommended for supervised reading with gentle little ones, or older ones who can treat a book well.

B00000J048|2.0|I got this because my 4-year-old loves gears.  My kids have the Playschool Busy Gears and love them.  I thought this would be a more advanced version of that for her to play with.  I don't like this toy though because it is really difficult to put together.  My daughter likes to turn the gears with the handle, but an adult always has to build it for her.  Other kids I have seen play with this toy have a lot of trouble too.  It looks cool but isn't a practical choice for a kid.  The base is really hard to put together because not all of the pieces will interlock with each other.  The pegs that hold the gears onto the base are also very hard to put on.
B002G1K82Q|3.0|Any excuse to feature Beatles music is usually worthwhile, but Across the universe is an mediocre picture wrapped in a psychedelic anti-war wet dream.    The picture has it's moments, the Character of Jude is excellent and well played by Jim Sturgess who next to the music is clearly the best thing about the picture.  The integration of the Beatles music in the picture works very well and the various musical numbers are really well choreographed, and the first 20 minutes of the picture are the strongest plotwise.      Unfortunately besides that there is little else to recommend.  The actual performances are not to blame, most are at least passable but yet another attempt to make a \\"statement\\" movie on Iraq=Vietnam just doesn't do it.  This movie on a 45 Million dollar budget failed to make $30 mil back, that was no accident.  You can feel the self importance of the filmmakers and it can't help but turn you off.    I'd recommend the sound track [[ASIN:B000UZ4G82 Across the Universe]] but unless you are a big fan of MSNBC this is a rental, worth seeing once for the musical numbers and Jim Sturgess (who I will look for in other pictures) but other than that, nothing special or important.  In fairness I can't see how the picture could ever be as important as the filmmaker thought it was.

B00139XZF4|3.0|When I discuss this movie with people, they are often surprised to note that it is based on a series of Novels known as the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy. [[ASIN:B001IDAIKK The Golden Compass]] is the first of the three novels, and to date the only one made into a motion picture (and based of the general controversy and dismal box office number in the US it's likely to remain that way). I should start by noting that I'm not one of those people who always believes that the book is better than the movie. There are several examples of movies and TV series that really out perform their print editions; Bones, Practical Magic, etc. I do believe; however, that it should be noted that this movie is significantly different from the novel. Please note, if you are a Golden Compass book or His Dark Materials fan, you may want to rent this one before buying.<br /><br />This movie is geared toward a younger child than the books. Given its intended audience it does rather well. There's not much room for character development so Lyra's actions don't always make a great deal of sense.<br /><br />The biblical reference to the \\"Authority\\" from the book trilogy has been cleverly removed from the film so it's also not as clear what the character's motivations are. There are some spirited performances; however, from Dakota Blue Richards (Lyra), Nicole Kidman (Ms. Coulter), and Ian McKellen (Iorek Byrnison). Freddie Highmore's vocalization of Pantalaimon (Lyra's Daemon) almost made me turn off the film on 4 separate occasions.<br /><br />Beyond the characters and plot, the visuals are amazing. It's very clear that this movie had a great deal of special effects budget. It was also not afraid to hold some gorey punches (pun intended) here and there.<br /><br />The soundtrack isn't bad, but it's certainly not going to be iTunes' top-seller.<br /><br />The bonus content on the BluRay edition of this film is definitely worth the extra for the two disc edition. Speaking of BluRay, if you are trying to decide between it and the DVD copy for this film I would highly recommend the BluRay edition. There's a lot of graphical wizardry, the kind that BluRay does extremely well.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's worth a rent if you have children, or if you enjoy family type movies. As a fan of the \\"His Dark Materials\\" novels I was extremely disappointed, especially with the end of this film. If you are concerned about renting or purchasing this for your family due to the controversy surrounding it, as always make the decision that's right for you, but know that they've greatly downplayed the parts that caused most of the controversy in the novels (for better or worse).<br /><br />If you are interested in other books in the same series as the one this movie was based off of, here you go:<br /><br />-[[ASIN:0375846727 The Subtle Knife, Deluxe 10th Anniversary Edition (His Dark Materials, Book 2)(Rough-cut)]]<br />-[[ASIN:0375846735 The Amber Spyglass, Deluxe 10th Anniversary Edition (His Dark Materials, Book 3)(Rough-cut)]]<br />-[[ASIN:0375843698 Lyra's Oxford]]py for this film I would highly recommend the BluRay edition.

B00005AG7K|5.0|After reading numerous reviews all over the internet, including Netflix, I was a little wary of ordering this movie.  But, being as big a Beatles fan as I am, I couldn't resist.  I'm glad I didn't listen to the negative reviewers!    Yes, I do admit, the transfer quality could be better, but it's definitely not an unwatchable movie.  It is also one of the silliest movies I have ever seen, but then again, Help! and A Hard Day's Night were incredibly silly.  The only difference between those 2 movies and this one was that Magical Mystery Tour was an experimental movie with Paul at the helm through most of it.  It has no script, no plot, very short,and incredibly trippy at points.  But if you're a huge Beatles fan, I guarantee you will love this movie.    My only complaint?  Not enough George ;) Although I did love his performance of \\"Blue Jay Way\\"...one of those incredibly trippy moments I was talking about.    Again, a must-see for hard-core Beatles fans!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Take a classic action hero years removed from his action days, a cast of people who have never acted in a movie before, an experienced director and a cleverly plotted and written picture and you get a classic.    Gran Torino works on every level.  Eastwood absolutely shines as a old vet and autoworker who has two great pleasures in his life, his wife whose funeral begins the movie and his Gran Torino.  As Detroit changes and falls apart and the neighbors are increasingly Hmong he refuses to move despite all the prompts from his family.    Even better than Eastwood's performance is Ahney Her playing Sue Lor the girl next door whose brother becomes both the foe, then the friend of old man Kowalski.  Christopher Carley in his supporting role as the young parish priest also shines.    Unlike [[ASIN:B002G1K82Q Across the Universe]] you get an actual sense of the cost of violence and war and what it can do to an individual and a community.  It's a movie that actually has meaning.    Eastwood's direction isn't pretentious, it doesn't overshadow the message of the film or the purpose of the characters.  It works with the audience instead of preaching to them.  That's why one of the reasons why with a budget 12 million less than Across the Universe it managed to make 300 million more.    It's certainly worth $20 more.

B0039YZPZ4|4.0|It seems that Hollywood is obsessed with reviving old tales with new twists. I should start by saying, if you are a Holmes purist, you probably won't enjoy this movie. Sherlock is depicted ingeniously as ever, but this time he's got a knack for the boxing ring and a bit of a naughty side. Watson has some money management issues, but is otherwise the nagging voice of reason that supports Holmes.<br /><br />In terms of visual appeal, the movie is pretty spectacular. If you, like me, only opt for High Def when a movie really warrants it and stick with DVDs the remainder of the time, I'd recommend going HD with this one.<br /><br />The soundtrack is a bit... annoying. Holmes is no longer a classical violinist, but like to finger pick his violin... at times to test it's affect on animals. The suspense generating fingerpicking of the violin plays heavily into the soundtrack and actually distracted me a time or two from what was happening.<br /><br />To watch this movie, I had to initially come to terms with the transition in Holmes' character. He is not the Holmes of old. He is a darker, somewhat depraved variation of the beloved sleuth. If you really want to get the full effect of the film, you have to know that going in and open your mind to a new vision of Sherlock Holmes. Once I did this, I started to see the merits of the movie. The characters have a larger than life feel about them, the plot has plenty of suspense and twists, there is an element of the occult, a strong underpinning of science, and some humorous moments as well.<br /><br />It also, surprisingly had some replay value. The end reveals aspects of the plot I didn't notice on the first run. When I gave it a second watch I noticed considerably more.<br /><br />My vote- definitely worth a rent. If you like visually appealing movies, detective movies, or something Douglass Preston/Lincoln Childish... you may want to consider purchasing it.<br /><br />In case you don't feel like waiting for it to ship, it appears that if you purchase it in hard copy you can watch it immediately via Amazon's Video on Demand service between now and when it arrives.n watch it immediately via Amazon's Video on Demand service between now and when it arrives.

B00009R6J7|4.0|I find this pretty useful for landscape type photos so that I can get my camera leveled on uneven ground.  It is very convenient that it fits in the hot shoe of my camera.  Unfortunately it doesn't fit snugly so it can get bumped out (which means I have to sometimes hunt for it when I am shooting late in the day or on uneven/rocky areas).

B002ZG9788|2.0|Director Louis Leterrier, who brought us the most recent Marvel superhero [[ASIN:B001DHXT1G Hulk]] film and some other halfway decent action flicks, directs a remake of the [[ASIN:B00005JKO7 1981 overblown semi-classic]] most noteworthy for being the last film to feature Ray Harryhausen's lovable stop motion animation.  It's funny that Leterrier's film was supposed to have its visual effects stand as its greatest strength when as it turns out some of his action scenes, and more specifically the interactions between CGI monsters and normal characters, are about as seamless as Harryhausen's outdated efforts, which were themselves outgunned by George Lucas and others thirty years ago.  Harryhausen's work was probably deemed most eye-popping almost sixty years ago (i.e.[[ASIN:B00001W9GA The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]).  Yes, there are some state of the art effects happening but they are handled by subpar imaginations and creativity that is definitely more miss than hit, and I mean that commentary to apply further to the costumes, sets, and make-up threefold.  The make-up is bad, the concepts are trite and at times over-stylized, and the hair!  Oh my goodness, the hair.  It seems that every alpha warrior of Argos has three hours to strategically place mud on themselves, apply eye-liner, and create extravagant cornrows and dreadlock-like mullet extensions.  And if you think I'm only going to be critical of this movie's visual flaws, keep reading.<br /><br />First, let's summarize.  The film follows a family of fisherman with the usual British accents who stumble upon a demi-god baby named Perseus (Sam Worthington).  As the story unfolds and the gods get really mad at people for thinking they are cooler than the gods, Perseus gets mad enough to allow his rage and taste for vengeance drive him toward going after the oh-so evil god of Hades and his vile sea creature titan, the Kraken.  But in order to do that he needs Medusa's head, and in order to get that he needs to talk to these batty old blind witches, and in order to do that he needs to fight a whole bunch of gigantic scorpions.  Along the way he also better start liking and praying to his god daddy so he can use a flying horse and his fancy but kind of ancient-looking lightsaber.  He's got to save Andromeda (played meaninglessly by Alexa Davalos) and maybe even at the end of the story Zeus will be kind of enough to grant him a lovely sex slave in Io (played yummy-ly by Gemma Arterton).<br /><br />Worthington's acting can be described as kind of like Russell Crowe in that really intense scene in [[ASIN:B000NU2CY4 Gladiator]] when Maximus reveals himself to Commodus in the arena, only Worthington talks like that all the time and it never ever changes, not even for a second.  Liam Neeson (Zeus) hams it up and Ralph Fiennes (Hades) makes Neeson's performance look comparably very serious.  Polly Walker (Casseopiea) recycles her role as Atia in [[ASIN:B0028RXXE8 HBO's Rome]] but strictly in the most superficial sense, because she was wasted and her role, like many here, was merely part of the set.  Danny Huston (Poseidon) was completely wasted.  The rest of the cast came off as a bunch of awkward live action role-players gathered together right from their LARPing event as starstruck extras, but they were instead given speaking parts.  Even worse than that was a character who I can't seem to find a name for anywhere.  He was a priest of sorts who looked to worship Hades and sacrifice Andromeda.  He delivers truly some of the worst acting I've seen in a very very long time.<br /><br />The acting is an easy target and so is the writing.  Many will forgive these things but I will not, so keep that in mind.  The writing in scenes with less action is unbearable and the screenplay is lazy, even for a remake of a film with a lazy screenplay to begin with.  Still, I'm really being hard on this film when it did have some brights spots that are incredibly memorable and show-off the amazing CGI without being too gratuitous.  To say the film doesn't go way overboard at times with its effects is an understatement.  Instead of coming out of a cage deep in the ocean the Kraken is released after the entire ocean floor breaks open.  His exit from the water is indeed remarkable but you know that already if you've seen the commercials; it's just a longer version of that.  The Pegasus is beautiful too and the horse they had was great.  The real work with the horse combined with the very believable CGI in his scenes were seamless and very enjoyable.  However, the best scene in the movie has been kept pretty well from the public and that is of course Medusa.  Instead of the ugly stop-motion snake lady slithering quietly in the memorable gothic horror-like scene from the original 1981 movie, we get a beautiful face within a mane of snakes and a fast-moving gorgon that petrifies her enemies in by far the most keenly edited footage the film has to offer.  That scene by itself might be worth the price of admission to many but it still doesn't quite capture the charm of the original stop-motion Medusa.<br /><br />This isn't an inspired movie but for the most part it doesn't deviate from the spirit of the original, for better or worse.  It even makes one very well placed inside joke to lovers of the original film, but that scene's charm is quickly snuffed out by alarming and unintentional irony.  If I was twelve that would've gone over my head and this movie gets 4 out of 5 stars, but I'm not twelve. One more thing, the 3-D adds virtually nothing to this film as an experience seeing in a theater, unless you count wearing dark glasses for two hours.  Wait for DVD or blu-ray.To say the film doesn't go way overboard at times with its effects is an understatement.

B0007OASII|5.0|I discovered Kamelot through the Ghost Opera (2nd coming) disc. As a direct result of Memento Mori (the live version on 2nd coming), I decided to try Black Halo. I continue to be impressed with the band in all aspects of their music making!    I continue to be lost in the revery of finding the type of music that I only dreamed of 20 years ago; an amazing blend of metal, prog, symphonic, and melodic music blended with intelligent lyrics and story lines. The Black Halo is the musical equal of Ghost Opera (or perhaps I should say that the other way around). Now, instead of having one of the best albums in my entire collection, I have two!    My desire is to describe every last note, every last word, every last harmony on this album. However, I will spare you that description. The musicianship of EVERY memeber of this band is amazing, technically comparable to any one else in the music industry, yet respectfully restrained to within the message and the music of the song and the album.    The basis of this album is the second half of a story tightly linked to the classic poem of Faust by the 19th century German author Goethe. The album picks up with the primary character (Ariel - Faust in the original poem) morning the loss, due to his own pride, of his true love and unborn child. The story carries through, in a very emotive fashion, through to his realization that his prideful desire for knowledge has led him to disaster, only to be rescued from eternal damnation in the end. Only, Kamalot adds the twist of revealing that this whole story, begun on the Epica album, had been a play, with us being the audience. The music and lyrics are so involving, that I decided to go check out the original epic poem from the library to compare the two.    The album contains several brilliant pieces. My favorite remains Memento Mori, fast becoming a personal favorite. However, there is not a weak song on this album. Add to that the fact that all the songs on this album flow to support the story line and each other amazing well, and you have an amazing concept album.     Of course, this album is part two in the tail. When I received this disc, I had still not heard Epica (part I of this story line). Even minus the first half of the story line, the album is so good, it stands entirely on its own merit. Based on 1) how intreging this album is, and 2) how enjoyable Kamalot as a band is, I have decided to purchase Epica as well. OK, so I am doing this backwords. It seems to be working so far! If you haven't got it yet, this album, along with Ghost Opera, is an absolute must!

0143038095|5.0|I'll just come out and say it: I think this book is very good, and I think it will hold up well over time. There are a lot of different story lines running through The Joy Luck Club (TJLC), so how you rate it may depend on where you place your focus, but here's why I think it is so good:     SUMMARY  On the face of it, this book follows the intertwined lives of four families of Chinese immigrants and their first-generation American children. I was most drawn to the story of Jing-mei (\\"June\\"). After the passing of her often-distant mother (Suyuan), June suddenly takes an interest in getting to know Suyuan's circle of friends better. In the course of meeting with them weekly to play mah-jongg, June gradually develops a comprehension of her mother's very full, very different life in China so long ago. Suyuan's courage in the face of devastating adversity throws June's childhood memories into drastically different context. Eventually, June discovers the existance of step-sisters she didn't know she had, whom she ultimately travels to find.       THEMES WITH BROAD APPEAL  I'm neither Chinese nor a woman, yet I found I could not only relate to everything going on, but was frequently reminded of people in my own life. Parents the world over deal with pride and disappointment in their children. Each generation from the dawn of time has lamented how \\"kids these days\\" seem so quick to abandon sacred and meaningful old ways, in favor of vacuous and superficial fads. So often, progeny don't comprehend the hardships their elders endured. Children struggle with parental expectations, and the all many ways their parents seem \\"out of touch\\" and unable to fully appreciate the particulars of their lives. Every family has inter- and intragenerational friction, even power struggles, at times. Sibling rivalry is a universal experience among anyone who has siblings. For hundreds of years, immigrants from all walks have come to America, hoping to partake in the economic opportunities, andfrequently wishing to establish a new life and a new identity here, but also hoping to instill in their children a sense of heritage and identity, and to see them carry on some of the traditions and treasured values of the Old World. How each of us manages (or doesn't manage) to navigate at least some of these issues is a large part of who we are. It's the stuff of our individual characters, and composes much of our lives' stories. I feel all these things in The Joy Luck Club, and I feel them sincerely. In that sense, this is a very human book. Just because most of the characters are women does not make this \\"chick lit\\". Likewise, the characterization of TJLC as niche \\"Chinese-American lit\\", merely because the characters happen to be Chinese is no more apt than calling Solzhenitsyn's Cancer Ward \\"a story about some white guys\\".     AMY TAN'S TECHNICAL SKILL AS A WRITER   At the center are four older women, all immigrated from China, who now meet weekly in their San Francisco neighborhood to play mah-jongg and gossip. They gossip about - what else?- their families... which introduces us to their children (all daughters). The mah-jongg backdrop turns out to be a very organic device for introducing characters. TJLC begins in present day, but various reminiscences start filling in back stories. Because the writing is sincere, and the characters have depth, what unfolds is a larger collage of the lives of four families, which is richer and more universal than just a pigeon-holed story about \\"immigrants\\", or \\"the Chinese-American experience\\" or \\"mothers and daughters\\", etc. Tan's writing is uncommonly fluid; characters emerge, take center stage for a while, and then slip off again into the periphery. Her real skill in this is in letting each character make enough of an impression so the reader will keep all the players straight. That was my experience exactly. Often when books have too many characters, I find myself thinking \\"now which one was this person again?\\" Not thecase with TJLC; Amy Tan strikes just the right balance, gradually fleshing out each character, but also maintaining the momentum of the narration so it doesn't seem to get bogged down in a lot of expository dialogue or dissecting descriptions. I don't mean to gush, but too often stories of this scope tend to fragment as \\"the center cannot hold\\". Rooting everything back to the four women seems to averted that problem. Moreover, Amy Tan has a very liquid, readable style. We've all plodded through books that made us very conscious of the fact that we were sitting there, reading a book. We've all snapped out of a dazed state to find we've been staring, uncomprehending, at some word for seconds, maybe minutes. For me, The Joy Luck Club was at the other end of the bell curve: several times I glanced down at a page number to realize \\"Oh! I just blew through thirty pages like it was nothing!\\"     At this point, I was going to launch into (what I imagined to be) a deconstruction of some less favorable reviews of this book. On reflection, I don't think the The Joy Luck Club requires any such assistance. It's an excellent book, engaging and memorable; I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it has my highest recommendation.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|So one of the things that prevented me from initially buying this complete series from the original release was that packaging.  The main reason was it was released years before the individual seasons began to be released, so I feared perhaps it wasn't re-mastered.  So I sprang for this newer release of the complete series.<br /><br />Everything's already great and such, so I'll clarify the packaging:<br /><br />It's exactly the sort of packaging you'd get from the individual season releases.  One of my main gripes actually is that the Season 2 Blu Ray release was released the same time as this one, with an individual Season 3 and Season 4 coming in some dim and distant future.<br /><br />Instead, this release has the whole series, with each season in its own cardboard container.  Season 1 and Season 2 are exactly the same as the individual season releases, with season 3 and 4 likely going to end up being the same design as this one.  It also comes with \\"The Plan\\" in its own individual plastic case<br /><br />As for the series: No movie, TV show, song, any work of art has ever drawn me in so intensely, made me care so much for the people and the objects and the world, and made me cry so intensely, virtually on cue with the musical cues in \\"Daybreak\\".  It's a series I watched through over a month's time, and went right back to watch it over again because I found myself missing it so intensely.  Even after a second runthrough, I cannot stop thinking about it.<br /><br />Battlestar Galactica is not a science fiction program.  Calling it such is painfully weak and limiting in describing what it is, like calling a living person a bag of meat.  It's a drama about people, propelling a story that is deeply personal, pseudo-mystical, painfully compelling, and blissfully free of the sorts of things that made Star Trek Voyager and Enterprise, and even some episodes of The Next Generation insufferable: pointless technobabble, broad, one-dimensional characters, little to no continuity within a show or even the same episode, bland, boring, generic visuals and worse music.ame episode, bland, boring, generic visuals and worse music.
B0036EH3TS|1.0|Another example of how the film industry has substituted special effects for plot and character development.  The script is a mess and the story is completely predictable.  You do not feel any compassion for any of the one-dimensional characters.  The creators of this mess  must have thought \\"This script sucks but, hey, it takes place in outer space so everyone will be so gaga over that that they won't care.\\"<br /><br />If you want to see a good Bruce Willis film, I recommend \\"16 Blocks\\" - not this stinkeroo.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The Big Bang Theory Season two was a great buy on Amazon! It's hard to find a cheaper price in stores, I purchased both season 1 and 2 and the total price was still less than what I would have paid for just this season alone in a Popular Electronics chain store. This Season is just as funny as the first, a must for any fan of the show.

B001YYQ9SS|4.0|This is a most own for all Final Fantasy fans even if you already own the DVD version of the film. New scenes, changes in the story and new render for the hairs and the clothes were all added to this good looking fan-service of a movie. However, this version won't gain any new fans, it's just more for people who love the Final Fantasy 7 universe.
B002DKGWSE|1.0|I am not sure what these folks are talking about. This new version is much tamer than the original. The rape scene is extremely short and, by today's standards, rather tame.<br />Any indication that people walked out during the rape scene is probably phoney promotional propaganda. The rape is so quick that you wouldn't have time to walk out before it was all over. I felt that I needed to put the original on the whole time I was watching this. To make matters worse, the story freely lifts elements from \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\". So much so that the whole movie seems more \\"I Spit...\\" than \\"Last House\\".<br />That's outright thievery.<br />I wasn't shocked by anything in this picture. Its just another time filler in the ridiculous over saturation of horror remakes.<br />Lame. Very lame.<br />The viewer is the one getting raped.

B002ZG4QB6|5.0|I am a long time fan of Cliff Richard and the Shadows. I was lucky to experience their performance in Malaysia (Merdeka Stadium), back in the 60s. At that time, I was 17. This DVD brought back lots of good memories of how simple things were back in my youth era. Lyrics were clean, great rhythm and music were at its greatest at that time, with Elvis Presley and all. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who simply grew up with Cliff Richard and the Shadows. They still sing great and their chemistry never changed. I wish they would perform in Malaysia one more time!    Arrison Teoh  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

B004HWXMDO|4.0|Re-review on JUNE 2016<br /><br />I wrote a review on the Audio CD, but then I deleted it in favor of a newer review. I have the 2001 paperback reprint of the 1997 edition. REBECCA is a good book, but I am afraid that this book centers on the rich class, so the readers might have trouble relating themselves to the important characters. Most of the characters are very isolated, especially the servants, including the housemaid who dresses in black and has icy, ghoulish countenance. Nevertheless, the fall of the rich class is symbolized and would intrigue the readers.<br /><br />The narrator of the story, albeit nameless, is poor at the beginning of her life, but then she marries a widowed rich, sophisticated, elegant gentleman named Maxim de Winter. Then the pair heads to the manor named Manderlay. There, they have a lot of servants and a lot of food. The servants, especially the same housemaid named Ms Danvers, cannot take the second Mrs de Winter seriously due to her poor background. Instead, they favor the previous late Mrs Rebecca de Winter. Also, Maxim's peers look down on her. Worse, the narrator feels inferior about herself because she hasn't done or possessed anything that Rebecca did, like activities, sports, charm, elegance, beauty, etc.<br /><br />Near the end, the façade of Rebecca is exposed, enabling the narrator to overcome her insecurities and to be in charge of the manor and to gain social status. Unfortunately, Maxim murdered Rebecca and admits it to the narrator. Ironically, the narrator decides to stay by his side, and Maxim is able to get away with murder. Consequently, Manderlay burns down.<br /><br />Rereading the novel makes the mystery tone draggy and pointless to readers. However, that should not affect the quality of the novel itself. A reader would be good for analyses on characters, but most of analyses center on the titular character herself. While the narrator herself might not intrigue readers much, the narrator can be seen as interesting. The narrator starts out as young, naïve and weak-willed; in the end, she becomes mature, worldly and courageous. Maxim has been always an angry man throughout, but he presents himself as kind, quiet, poised, and helpful. He is helpful AND reliable because he rescues some diver from the waters and he speaks other languages.<br /><br />Troubling with the novel is the possible escapism from real-world events. REBECCA was published at the time when Europe was threatened by the expansion of Nazi Germany and when the United Kingdom's then-King Edward VIII abdicated, leading to George VI's accession. Also, REBECCA was told in flashbacks throughout the 94.44% of the novel. The novel starts with the narrator's dreams of Manderlay and then the couple trying to survive tragedy that struck upon them. However, I'm startled by Maxim and the narrator's unknown current location. Europe would no longer be safe when the threat of war was upcoming. One wonders whether they are in America, but the novel says that they are staying in a not-too-shabby hotel somewhere outside England. Maybe Wales or Scotland? Where else?<br /><br />Of course, REBECCA is about Rebecca, eh? No need to tell readers about European politics. But at least readers would enjoy this by re-readings.
0618918248|1.0|I must say I found it rather interesting that a proponent of evolutionary biology and atheism on the basis of evolution being a scientific fact would not focus on scientific arguments that show the illegitimacy of a creation scenario (the Earth being less than 10,000 years old).  Rather, what Dawkins has put forth in my mind is a philosophical treatise which is replete with his own personal bias.  Not one instance in the book does he even define the terms `evolution' or `natural selection.'  Yet he uses `evolution' and `natural selection' as the answer to all of life's conundrums.  The only notion I have of `natural selection' after reading this book is of a gradual slope. Clearly some understanding of science is a prerequisite to reading this work.  Though he states levels of atheism in this book, truly Dawkins is an agnostic who lives his life as though there were no God.  Dawkins believes that without religion the Twin Towers would still be standing and yet without religion would the world truly be at peace, Darwinian thought has led individuals to seek to form a utopia in the past (Nazi Germany, I am not calling all evolutionists Nazis) surely without such thought we would still have more than 6 million Jews alive today, along with untold numbers who inadvertently died thanks to individuals like Hitler such as Stalin.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Honestly if you have read one of Dan Brown's books leave it at that, The Lost Symbol proves this to be true. I first read Davinci Code and that was interesting. Then read Angels and Demons which was also interesting but then you get familiar with Dan Brown's writing style and it becomes repetitive and a bit boring. While his other books are pretty good, The Lost Symbol reads as a half hearted attempt at what the previous two books were. It seems as though Dan Brown is also bored with cranking out Robert Langdon symbol stories. There is but so much you can squeeze out of symbology and at some point you just have to switch gears. If you have read any of his previous books I wouldnt bother, if you haven't pick up Davinci code or Angels and Demons before reading this one.

B000002HJD|5.0|An American Prayer - Jim Morrison: Music By The Doors (1978) is an uncensored poetic musical journey into the mind of Jim Morrison.  In December 1970 Morrison recorded some poetry in a recording studio.  Then in 1978 the three surviving members of The Doors got together and recorded music to go along with Morrison's spoken word poetry.  The music is good and different from their old material.  Some of it is jazzy, some of it is Steely Dan-ish, some of it is vintage Doors.  The Doors also got help from some session players - Bob Glaub (bass), Jerry Scheff (bass), Reinol Andino (percussion) and Arthur Barrow (synthesizer programming).  The music does a good job mixing in with Morrison's twisted poetry and accenting it.<br /><br />I bought the cassette tape of this album in 1984 and had to get the CD, which I did in 1995.  I listened to the tape a lot in the summer of 1985.  I think this album is meant to be listened to from start to finish to get the full effect.  Some of the material is shocking (such as Lament) while other material is plain entertaining and even funny.  This CD comes with three bonus tracks that the original release didn't have (Babylon Fading, Bird Of Prey and The Ghost Song.<br /><br />If you want to dive into the twisted mind and poetry of Jim Morrison, then this album is a must listen.  Again, the music really fits well with the spoken words.  If you're a Doors fan then you should hear this album at least once.  Morrison was, more than anything else, a poet.  Later he became a rock star with poetic lyrics.  Then he wanted to be a film maker.  I highly recommend this album for all Doors fans.

All religion seem to believe in so much conviction that, all claim that they have the ultimate truth, or pathway leading to the truth.

B00009R86L|1.0|yes, the product does it job, when it's in one piece. i bought it for a messenger bag (holding camera gear) for a one week trip and after the first day, the black vinyl piece with the velcro straps was already peeling from the white pad piece. needless to say, within 4 days use the pad had completely detached from the black piece with the straps. so if you only plan on using it for a few days, it's good. otherwise, consider it disposable (and a waste of your money).
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Longtime Amazon customer, first-time reviewing.  This film was extraordinary!  I view a TON of films all the time, mostly at the theaters.  My interest in this film was piqued by an article in Entertainment Weekly about why it was direct to DVD and not wide-released.  Still not sure why - I think that this film would definitely tug at the heartstrings of any Marley & Me fans.  It has a great cast, love Joan Allen in everything and Richard Gere was so believable as Hachi's savior, owner, and true soulmate to the end.  This film was beautiful, inspiring, so touching, and really just powerfully illustrated that love and loyalty have no boundaries between species.  I would absolutely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys animal or dog stories, good for kids, although it will probably produce some sniffs and tears toward the end.  I won't spoil it, but it is definitely worth the viewing.  Great cast, great story, fantastic dog, and all inspired by an amazing true story.  Personally, I found this film to be superior to Marly & Me because it did not get the typical polished and overglamourized Hollywood treatment.  By keeping it simple and true, it retains a more serious and emotional story.  Wonderful film, I encourage everyone to give Hachi a try - you will love it!

B00328G4V6|5.0|Like most here I'm a long time Hendrix fan and have both suffered through the abomonitions (Midnight Lightning)and the sublime albums ( Jimi Hendrix Blues or Hendrix in the West)released after his death. I was skeptical when I first heard about this release but like all Hendrix devotee's I KNEW I was going to give it a listen or two; what a pleasant surprise! I loved it. Don't get me wrong, it's not a perfect release ( I felt the Sunshine of Your Love cover was inferior to other versions I heard by Jimi for instance) but I strongly feel this album is fairly representative of Jimi's vision for his songs. The version of \\"Stone Free\\" that leads of the disc is an excellent statement of the albums direction: some of the same-same old played just a little different. With anyone but Jimi that would not be good enough, but remember we ARE talking about Jimi; these alternate takes resonate!     As far as the presentation: I like the digi pak packaging and felt the liner notes provided ample insight into the individual tunes. Nice photos inside and I love the cover. Overall this is a topline release. It's not Electric Ladyland but it IS a must own Hendrix album just the same.I wanted to give this release 4.5 star but I decided to round up based on my appreciation for the care that went into this (especially compared to some of the crap I have seen in previous Alan Douglas years). Experience Hendrix once again ...Visit the Valleys of Neptune... you'll dig the trip!
069111966X|1.0|Bought the book because it had great reviews and looked beneficial.  Once I got it I read through the first couple of chapters and did not find it useful at all.  I am an engineer and the the basic skills he presents are taught early on in the undergraduate curriculum.  Needless to say I was very disappointed.  This may be a good book for someone that is in high school to sharpen critical thinking skills.

I love every track on this disc. BUY IT!!!!!!!
B002SJIO4A|3.0|This movie is not a bad movie persay, but it does not capture your imagination. I had a hard time feeling sympathy for the main characters. After about an hour I noticed I was checking regularlly to see how much longer the movie was. It could have been much better, but I would suggest buying a used verson or Netflik rather then new. You probablly won't watch it more than once or twice.

020530902X|2.0|This one is worth a look if you collect this kind of book for fun or for completeness, but there are much more thorough and thoughtful and self-aware books out there. Read Geoffrey Pullum's critique of the book in the Chronicle before buying. I would recommend [[ASIN:0618753869 Keys for Writers, 5th Edition]] in place of Strunk & White. It costs more, but it's probably all you'll need in terms of writing style, excepting perhaps [[ASIN:B0032MNG0O The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association 6th Ed [Pub Manual 6E] (PAPERBACK)]], if APA style is required in your field.<br /><br />If your problem is actually sitting down and writing on a regular basis, then [[ASIN:1591477433 How to Write a Lot: A Practical Guide to Productive Academic Writing]] is probably the best one.<br /><br />Pullum's critique: [...]

0752889796|5.0|Do not doubt yourself and not purchase this book. This book is a great read and if you liked the first one (wizards first rule) then you will love this one. Like i have said in the other reviews, goodkind is great at building characters. You fall inlove with who you read about, or you hate them totally. I would recomend this series to any fantasy fan. I am on the sixth of the series and only one of those is not very good, but read this and you will like it.
B0036B8MZU|4.0|Spartacus: Blood and Sand goes way over-the-top in the sex, gore and bad language departments. Take the sex from HBO's Rome, the foul language from Deadwood, multiply it by ten, and you might be getting close. I have to say that after I got through a couple of episodes, it bothered me less and less. This is a show made for guys. I'm sure most women will find almost every aspect of this program repulsive, although it seems that many reviewers here are women. Perhaps I'm wrong.<br /><br />The series starts off okay, but it's not until a few episodes in that the storyline and character development really takes hold. Don't give up early on or you'll really be missing out on a show that improves with each passing week. The main actor who plays Spartacus, Andy Whitfield, grew on me. I wasn't sure at first, but I can't picture anyone else in the role now. Too bad about his recent cancer diagnosis. I hope he can pull through and continue on next season. Lucy Lawless and Jon Hannah bring name and face recognition, while also turning in good supporting performances. The only negative is that the slow motion CGI is a bit distracting at times, but I like the overall \\"300\\" style of the show. The fight scenes are some of the most brutal I've ever seen.<br /><br />I never had the Starz network until this show came along. It's safe to say they will have a loyal customer until Spartacus: Blood and Sand is no more.<br /><br />Edit: 4/25/2010<br /><br />I just finished the finale and it was excellent. Good enough for me to bump up my rating to 5 stars if I could.

0385523386|5.0|At times harrowing, at times gut-bustingly funny, Kerman's take on her yearlong odyssey in the Federal Corrections system challenges your preconceptions about women in prison and sadly confirms the absence of sensible policies in our penal system. While Kerman is clearly an atypical inmate, her ability to capture the essence of her characters --from indomitable mother figures to perverse corrections officers--provides a nuanced perspective on how the wheels of our justice system grind all its participants down. Not only is this book a memoir and a piece of pointed social criticism, it is also a romance--for the boyfriend who sticks by her side, and, perhaps more significantly, for all the family and friends who lovingly support her. I finished the book glad that its author emerged from her ordeal stronger and wiser, and feeling quite a bit wiser myself.

B0039OGGVQ|5.0|\\"Slash\\" is an excellent, guitar-driven rock album.  It cements Slash's status as a true guitar legend, while bolstering his reputation as a songwriter (in case you forgot his key contributions to Paradise City, Welcome to the Jungle, and Sweet Child O' Mine).  \\"Slash\\" is full of great riffs, stunning solos, and several excellent guest vocal performances.    First, \\"Slash\\" offers the signature Gn'R riffs we've come to love.  \\"Ghost\\" opens the album with an excellent guitar hook, with fellow Gn'R alum Izzy Stradlin' building the tempo with driving rhythm guitar.  The guitar on this track is so good, you almost forget Ian Astbury's solid vocal.  The Gn'R sound is perhaps best evident on \\"Doctor Alibi,\\" (track 8) where Lemmy offers a fist-pumping defiant vocal while Slash provides a killer riff and solo reminiscent of Gn'R's punk-rock roots.  Iggy Pop literally puts the \\"Pee\\" in Punk in the finale \\"We're All Going to Die,\\" a track on which you cannot help realize the Stooges' influence on Guns n' Roses, and even Axl's vocal approach.    Second, \\"Slash\\" has several epic solos that are the stunning high point of several songs.  Indeed, if there is one thing that has made Slash stand out among the \\"legend\\" guitarists, it has been his ability to generate solos that are the musical highlights of even the greatest songs (e.g., Sweet Child, November Rain).  On the Zeppelin-esque lead single \\"By the Sword,\\" Slash begins his solo at a slow burn, building to a dramatic crescendo that propels the song to fireworks.  On \\"Nothing to Say\\" with Avenged Sevenfold's M. Shadows, Slash shreds like the best of speed-metal guitarists, and then offers a one-minute speed solo that will, as they say, \\"melt your face.\\"  On \\"Gotten,\\" Slash transforms an Adam Levine angelic vocal into an epic power ballad with a soaring arena-raising solo so good you wish Slash would have kept going for another minute or two.  Similarly, on \\"I Hold On,\\" Slash delivers a power riff followed by a strong solo that makes the song stand up as a solid rock effort, even hampered by Kid Rock's limited vocal range.  And Slash delivers a powerful blues-based solo on \\"Starlight\\" that evokes (and may even surpass) his tremendous solo on Use Your Illusion's \\"Don't Cry\\"    Third, the highlights of the album are \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" with Fergie, and \\"Watch This\\" with Dave Grohl and Duff McKagain.  \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" starts with a wicked Slash riff that sets the stage for Fergie's intense vocal and a powerful chorus that will surprise anyone who's listened to the Black Eyed Peas.  It's the perfect example of two musicians making the other better.  \\"Watch This\\" is a powerful instrumental opening with a devastating riff that's a cross between Velvet Revolver's \\"Slither\\" and \\"She Builds Quick Machines.\\"  Grohl's powerful drumming and Duff's thumping bass give Slash a groove to lay down 3 minutes of straight riffing and soloing -- and literally show how good he can be.  Because Grohl and Duff hold their own so well, \\"Watch This\\" surprisingly turns out to be a great power rock song -- and never sounds like a guitarist showing off.  Strong stuff, indeed!    Fourth, the only real disappointment \\"Slash\\" offers is Chris Cornell's contribution on \\"Promise.\\"  This song never delivers the incandescent moment you would expect from two of the best at what they do.  Although Slash offers a catchy riff, and Cornell as solid vocal w/ inspiring lyrics about not giving up, I expected a lot more from the vocalist who sang such classics as \\"Outshined\\", \\"Hunger Strike\\" and \\"Cochise.\\"  (\\"Crucify the Dead\\" is arguably disappointing -- while it's strong for a recent Ozzy song, it's not that good for a Slash song.)    Fifth, Myles Kennedy is something of a revelation on the album.  He gives a strong, bluesy performance on \\"Back from Cali,\\" which really complements a strong Slash riff.  And \\"Starlight\\" is an excellent ballad where (pitchy parts on the high notes aside) Kennedy and Slash have strong chemistry.  One hopes that Kennedy's strong performance on this album may portend him being the next Velvet Revolver lead singer!  (A minor revelation is also Rocco DeLuca on \\"Saint is a Sinner,\\" which has a great vibe evoking a cross between Zeppelin's Battle of Evermore & Going to California.)    In sum, this a very strong effort from Slash!  \\"Slash\\" is a great rock album that stands on equal footing with Velvet Revolver's \\"Contraband\\" as the best album by a Guns N' Roses alum since \\"Use Your Illusion.\\"  Given how hard it is for Axl to show up for a concert on time -- let alone release an album every 20 years -- this is as good as it gets!

0393072231|3.0|I became interested in this book after seeing Michael Lewis interviewed on CNBC. In the segment, they brought out his ex boss from Salomon Brothers, John Gutfreund. Lewis had apparently \\"destroyed\\" Gutfreund in his earlier book, Liar's Poker. That made for some pretty awkward TV!<br />This book is a short, easy read. Its theme is that the financial system involving home mortgages, credit default swaps (CDSs), and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) was corrupt, and that the only people smart enough to notice and bet against it were a few socially awkward men. Even though these were real people, they seemed like caricatures - I actually had trouble distinguishing one from the other. They were rude, they thought everyone else was stupid, they were basically betting on the collapse of the financial system, and they had various personality disorders. The book was very repetitious with its explanation of the tower of risky mortgages and the failure of the ratings agencies to correctly rate the risk. Maybe it was less interesting with hindsight - I knew the ending so it wasn't suspenseful. I was kind of rooting for these \\"shorters\\" and mildly interested in what happened to them after their big \\"win\\". One took up guitar. A few investigated trying to sue the ratings agencies. Some felt ill.<br />This book made me feel ill too. I'm all for capitalism, but the lack of \\"social utility\\" in the trading activities described in this book was staggering. As Lewis said, the amazing thing was that \\"important people on both sides of the gamble left the table rich.\\" That is the really sickening part - the tax payer bailouts, the \\"too-big-to-fail\\" status, and the big Wall Street bonuses. Oh well, I am not optimistic that anything will really change. In short, this was one depressing book.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|I was really excited when I found out the Madonna was finally releasing this dvd.  I had waited for it since last November of 2009; it was originally scheduled to be released back then but something happened and the release date was changed.  I thought it was never coming out until I read it was coming out in April.  I bought my copy on Amazon.com and got it the Tuesday it came out.  I watched the whole concert and loved it.  Some songs were better than others but still an A+ dvd.  The bonus material on the dvd is 30 minutes long; it is great material.  It's how she prepared for the show in many countries and her life on tour with the dancers.  It's nice because she curses, laughs, and cries.  It's worth all the $24 that I paid for it ($16 for the DVD+Cd and $8 shipping).  Definetely something to get if you're a fan of MADONNA.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|I have no need to say any thing other than dittos to all the other bad reviews (I have only read two of them) and in 1951 a much better movie \\"When Worlds Collide\\" was made. Enough said!
0307386848|2.0|This is a novel written a long time ago.  A lot of the terms and expressions need explanations for the modern reader.  This edition of the masterwork by Austen does not have footnotes at the end, nor does it have an up-to-date scholarly introduction by some University professor.
B000002IJO|3.0|Not a real big fan of this record though Ratt thought they could do no wrong in the mid-eighties. `Dancing Undercover' is where the rips in the satin and silk first made their appearance. A very difficult recording from the band accounts as internal chemistry and excessive partying started to take its toll on the quality control of the music. Though filler had reared its ugly head through much of the second half of `Invasion' it pretty much proliferates album number three. \\"Dance\\" is a justified lead track and other high standards were set with \\"Body Talk\\" and \\"Slip of the Lip\\" but I mean after \\"Looking for Love\\" there really isn't much to recommend here. Warren De Martini does indeed shred but any talk of a real guitar partnership with Robbin Crosby must have seemed meaningless by this point. \\"Drive Me Crazy\\" is sort of hectic but again like much of the LP it pales in comparison to much of `Out of the Cellar'. `Dancing Undercover' isn't a bad record but is it indispensable hard rock? Hardly like much of commercial metal from 1986.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|Moon (2009) -is the film debut of Duncan Jones, aka Zoui Bowie, the eldest son of David Bowie. This is a very good independent film in the genre of space science fiction/drama with the well crafted elements of mystery and thriller. Of course, the film immediately brings to mind such classics as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solaris (1972) as well as Silent Running (1972), Alien (1979) and Outland (1981), all of which Jones names as the memorable films from his youth.  I say this not to criticize Moon. On the contrary, I believe it is an achievement of the young director/ writer that he made a film on the themes and subjects that have been explored many times by famous and prominent directors, and as result,  he made a clever, exciting, touching,  and original film. Moon  does not fascinate with the spectacular and flashy special computer generated effects, masterfully set fights or breathtaking chases. With 97 minutes of running time, Moon is basically one man show which belongs to charismatic and talented Sam Rockwell. Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an astronaut, working under the contract with the International Lunar Corporation, the company that found the way to efficient production of helium-3 on the Moon. The resulting helium is then shipped to Earth to be used as a source of cheap and much needed energy. Sam's contract  lasts 3 years, and when we meet him on the space station he has only two weeks left until his returning home to his wife he desperately longs for and the little daughter, whom he had never seen because she was born after he left for Moon. The only creature he communicates with all this time, is highly organized AI - computer Gertie, for whom Kevin Spacey lends his voice. Like the best films in the genre of sci-fi, the Moon is about a human in extreme conditions, physical, mental and moral. It is about the indifferent silence of space, the nostalgia for home,  for love, for Earth. It is also a thriller that makes an interesting twist in the plot. Most importantly, Sam is such an interesting and compelling character that we truly experience everything that he goes through and the choices he makes. To say more would be to spoil the movie. I only add that IMO, Kevin Spacey played one of his best and most human roles for long time.<br /><br />Jones is planning a follow-up film, titled Mute, which will serve as an epilogue to Moon and I would like to watch it because the ending of Moon was a little rushed, and I have few questions that were not answered in the first film.ost importantly, Sam is such an interesting and compelling character that we truly experience everything that he goes through and the choices he makes.

B001OQCV6K|4.0|I finally got a chance to see this much-hyped version of the Arthur Conan Doyle character and after all is said and done, this was most entertaining.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr was an inspired choice especially when considering Guy Ritchie is at the helm.  Downey perfectly fits Ritchie's frenetic vision of the legendary detective and the casting of Jude Law as a much more energized Dr. Watson is just wonderful.  Law's Dr. Watson is infinitely more his own man than any Watson I've witnessed before.  The chemistry between Downey and Law served the project quite well.<br /><br />The set design is amazing making this a visual delight.  The costumes and sets combined with Ritchie's energetic and rather imaginative editing all combine to create the perfect mood to accompany this action-packed, fun-filled ride.<br /><br />To be sure, the plot was rather muddled, rather busy, and rather ambitious which is also rather deftly camouflaged by the almost non-stop action.  Sherlock still remains the highly analytical, precise, and logical detective we all know and love but is refreshingly and delightfully encased in the always interesting Downey who is more than complemented by Law's more deliberate Watson.<br /><br />Some viewers felt that this version made a travesty of Doyle's original vision of Holmes. To each his own.  Seeing this in no way at all diminished (or elevated for that matter) my perception of Holmes.  Hey, guys, get over it!! - its only a character for godsakes!!!  By that very definition, a character is subject to as many interpretations as is necessary, making each perspective, whether you like it or not, just as valid as the next one.<br /><br />Fun movie. Excellent production standards. I definitely recommend!
B001NGBNI8|4.0|love this series and i am 32 years old. bought for a light read and was addicted with the first book. just the right amount of greek mythology and adventure. i would expect this would be great at sparking intrest in greek mythology in kids.

A must read for dog lovers.

B00383YC2S|5.0|Alizée's voice blends very well with the electronic music used in this album.  But the \\"electro\\" aspect of the music does not overpower the songs, which are written in a very classic pop style. The melodies are simply beautiful. Alizée is not known for a lot of vocal tricks, but her vocal timbre is so compelling to listen to and her range is quite amazing. The album is strong from the first song to the last. This is not an album where I find myself skipping over songs. It all holds together really well. I really liked her last album \\"Psychédélices\\", but I think this album is more consistent and is definitely a move in the right direction for Alizée. I wholeheartedly recommend this album!
B0017SXHR2|1.0|This DVD is the worst quality of any DVD I have seen.  It is unviewable.  I have $1 DVDs that are better quality.

Fortunately TCM ran the movie recently and the quality was very good, so I know a good copy is out there somewhere, just not at Amazon.

B002IYEQR4|5.0|I had been waiting to get & watch this for some time now. I must say I am not disapointed at all! To me this is the best version of this movie ever; totally beautiful on blu-ray too! The movie is super long but the time seems to go by fast & it's very entertaining. With the extra footage it does put a different twist on the whole film and leaves a more \\"darker\\" feeling over all. The ending catatrophy also seems more impactful as you connect with the people caught in the blast more in this version. The Black Freighter addition is more like a side story... it could have been left out but it doesn't hurt the movie as a whole. If I had to choose I would leave it in. I must say I loved it all & will watch it again & again. A great purchase!
B0024RIMBG|4.0|I picked this up as I had missed some of the songs from the original live performance that were not on the Greatest Journey DVD.  If you like Celtic Woman, you will love this one, as it has the original four vocalists (Chloe Agnew, Lisa Kelley, Orla Fallon, and Méav Ní Mhaolchatha), plus Hayley Westenra and, of course, the \\"flying fiddler\\", Máiréad Nesbitt.  The setting is marvelous and the performances were outstanding.  There appear to be two versions of this DVD, with the one I have missing one track (Orinoco Flow?) that the other apparently has.  This was the only disappointing thing about the DVD.  The video is better than that of their most recent \\"Songs from the Heart\\" DVD that was apparently recorded in high-definition and then \\"down-converted\\" to standard DVD format.  None of that here, as the video is sharp and the audio is crisp and stunning.  This one should be in every Celtic Woman fan's video library.
0425166805|4.0|I liked this book, I do find it funny that even today people still do not \\"read\\" carefully. Other reviews state \\"his opinion\\" yet no where in his book does he ever write or type \\"I think or I believe\\". He simply types/writes, What if or why does... These are simply questions not statements. If people would take the time to slow down and really read what is there and see what is around them, I think a lot of people would be surprised as to what they missed.

0393072231|5.0|As with his other books, Michael Lewis exhibits an outstanding ability to tell a story through a mix of complex issues. Others' comments have expressed disappointment at the paucity of deep commentary on the banks, the regulators and others involved in this debacle, but I feel no disappointment at all. My own career was deeply involved in the bursting dot-com bubble and I saw firsthand the behaviors of leading, allegedly world-class executives and allegedly world-class strategic consultants. Those behaviors were excused away but in my mind were criminal. That past experience convinces me that the people on whom Mr. Lewis focused in this book, and their involvement in the swirling mess around them, are the real story. This is far more insightful than a long commentary on the workings of the government officials, the Wall Street CEOs and the other most senior characters in some macroeconomic way. In some ways I believe that the CEO stories, though likely to appear in multiple ways, will never appear publicly in ways close to truth. This book, though, by focusing on the lesser-known but deeply-involved participants, provides a depth of understanding. The environmental, perhaps tectonic shifts in the financial markets surround them in the book but are explained in clear fashion. Kudos for this.

B000002H92|5.0|This is a great CD (well, two CDs). Every song on here is great(except \\"Little Red Rooster\\", I didn't realy like that one). If they removed the concert noises this could pass a studio album.<br /><br />The songs flow great, as if it was one concert, isntead of what it really is, which is the best parts of the songs being edited together.<br /><br />I would recomend this to any Doors fan. The songs \\"Build Me a Woman\\" and \\"Universal Mind\\" although written by The Doors were never recorded. \\"Alabama Song\\" has a much more eerie/haunting (for lack of a better word) sound, and is part of a great medley: \\"Alabama Song/Backdoor Man/Love Hides/Five to One\\". The medley of \\"Dead Cats, Dead Rats/Break on Through\\" is also great. \\"Dead Cats, Dead Rats\\" gets you pumped up for an energized and intense version of \\"Break on Through\\" with an extra verse added. The extended versions of \\"Souls Kitchen\\", \\"Roadhouse Blues\\", \\"Light My Fire\\", \\"Moonlight Drive\\", \\"The Unknown Soldier\\", and \\"When The Music's Over\\" are all great. They do great covers of \\"Who Do You Love\\" and \\"Gloria\\". The fifteen minute version of \\"The End\\" has most of the original lyrics swapped out with new stuff put in. \\"The Celebration of the Lizard\\" medley is the highlight of the CD. It is an epic poem that, if you really listen to it, will blow you away.<br /><br />I would recommend this to be your first live Doors CD. If you have this don't get \\"Absolutely Live\\" because that is just thed first CD from \\"In Conert\\", and you'll miss out on songs like \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"Love Me Two Times\\".
B002RAREAK|5.0|I bought this album because I heard \\"there goes my baby\\" on the radio.   I started to just download it and \\"daddy's home\\" because I'm tired of wasting money for two good songs,    but baby Usher did it!  And I don't normally like a whole lot of what's out there.      To me it is on par with confessions.   My favorite tracks in order of preference are:  (1) more, (2) mars v. venus, (3) papers, (4) there goes my baby, (5) daddy's home (hey daddy), (6) lil freak, .... with the rest being that I haven't really gotten a hard listen yet.   I have heard OMG - I think I'm outside of the demographic on that one, but not bad.   I just love Usher - he is a man to me.

B0014NDXGA|5.0|I replaced an older Bushnell rangefinder with the V2 mainly because the older model didn't work well at courses that didn't have the prisms on the flags. The V2 has worked at every course I've gone to whether the course had prisms on the flags or not. It's easy to use, the yardages show up almost instantly. The V2 will give you the confidence to go at the pin.  Additionally you can range objects on unfamiliar courses to figure out whether it's best to lay up or go for it. I played with a couple of guys that had the GPS range finders and while they were still trying to figure the distance to the flag, I had my number and was ready to go at the stick.  I highly recommend the Bushnell V2, it's an exceptional product plus Amazon.com had the best price I could find anywhere.

I wish this shameless practice would stop- and it will if we all vote with our patience as well as our dollars.

B00288KNLS|5.0|Yet another movie based on the works of comic god Neil Gaiman(sorry, no Sandman yet), this stop-motion animated film was directed by Henry Selick, whose former works include The Nightmare Before Christmas and James And The Giant Peach. It was one of the few movies that he acted alone from Tim Burton from, but was much more successful than his bomb of Monkeybone. Gaiman's book Coraline was largely inspired by Alice In Wonderland, and I'd have say that this film made for a better fantasy/suspense movie for kids that the recent Tim Burton one.<br /><br />Set in an apartment home in the midwest, Coraline is a bored girl whose family has recently moved into the old estate. After leaving all her friends behind from her former town, she finds her new crib to be slightly off. There's strange neighbors, an enigmatic stray cat, a chatty boy named Wybee(short for Wyborne)and a mysterious door in her living room which leads to a brick wall. One night, Coraline follows a mouse throught the door which leads to an alternate version of her house called the Other World. There, she encounters her Other Mother who runs it, who appears to be a friendlier doppleganger of her real mother. She cooks her lavish breakfast/dinners, introduces her to more entertaining versions of her already eccentric neighbors, and a silent copy of Wybee. However, Coraline soon realizes that this is all an elaborate trap, mainly because the cat in the Other World can talk and warns her. After O.M. tells her that can stay in this world forever as long as she gives up her eyes, Coraline runs away, but gets imprisioned with the ghosts of three other children that had given their souls to Other Mother, who is revealed to be a bedlam. As an extra insentive to get Coraline, she kidnaps her parents. The cat tells her to trick the bedlam into a game, so that she can free her parents and the ghost children. After facing the rather twisted residents of this nightmare as it unfolds around her, she has a final confrontation with Other Mother in her web. Coraline escapes, but the bedlam's hand makes it through to our side. Wybee helps bury the hand in a deep well, and then Coraline has a big garden party with the \\"real\\" members of her apartment building.<br /><br />This was an exceptionally creepy movie, but in a good way. Henry Selick manages to make this a hauntingly great experience, and definately not one for toddlers to see before hitting the hay. It was all done painstakingly with a large group of devoted animators whose efforts really paid off in the final product. The use of 3D is well done too without being looked at like some kind of gimmick, although its effect while watching it on TV is debatable. Regardless, this film should add to Selick's ongoing career as he's now signed on with Disney to do more feature films.h Other Mother in her web.

B00005JK8K|2.0|Yes, it tells a story in which there are code talkers. I don't feel it comes close to really telling their story, though. It's a Hollywood, tear-jerker, war movie. Cut w/the standard cookie cutter. The film is also heavy on totally unrealistic battle scenes. It's worth the 35 cents, not more.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Eagerly awaited most recent Enya album and I was not disappointed.  The only problem was, I had purchased the same album at Borders about two months earlier and had never opened (when i had pneumonia) and had forgotten.  Now I have two of these CDs. lol<br /><br />Not to worry - now I have one for the car.  It's interesting to see how she has progressed through the years - her music is more mature now and I never cease to be amazed at the intricacies of her harmony as she lays down multiple tracks one after the other.  Astounding.
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|David Tennant and Russle T. Davies do not fail to deliver in 2009 with these final 4/5 \\"specials\\" in High Definition. These episodes are the final journeys of the David Tennant's character, the tenth Doctor as he reconciles the loss of his \\"Best Friend\\" Donna Noble, who's memories he was forced to erase in order to save her life after she took on the mind of a Time Lord with his need for human companionship. The final episodes depict the internal conflicts that the doctor faces as he travels through space and time without a companion. As with nearly all of the Dr. Who episodes, each special is in itself a fantastic journey which add a critical piece to the overarching storyline, the end of the doctors life or the end of this iteration of the doctor. The 2009 season is concluded in grand fashion as the doctor is again faced with the great burden of being the only remaining Time Lord after \\"The Last Great Time War\\" as the Time Lords of Gallifrey attempt to break out of the time lock and end all of time. The final episode and the end of his life begins to conclude when he realizes that he must give his life to save the life of his friend Wilfred Mott, Donna's grandfather. The final moments of Tennant's tenure as the doctor are nothing short phenomenal as the tenth doctor concludes his life by breaking a few rules one last time saving the lives of his dearest friends and tying up one last loose end. He delivers some of his final lines as can only be done with David Tennant and the writing of Davies speaking not only as the doctor but as both Davies and Tennant themselves; \\"I don't want to go...\\". This is a must have for any Dr. Who fan of recent.

But they are simply delicious.
B002N1RM5A|5.0|Judging from live performances I've heard online,  Schubert's song cycles have been in the repertoire of Jonas Kaufmann for nearly a decade.  As he turns forty, he's no longer young, so it was right to persuade Decca to give him a lieder recital, even though these must sell much less than operas.  We lovers of Schubert are grocery store cats, ultra-finicky when it comes to Die Schone Mullerin. In particular, we are suspicious of opera stars attempting a cycle where emotions, though intense, must be expressed with a smaller, more contained vocal style. Belting out Schubert is forbidden, and the mellifluous ghosts of Aksel Schotz and Heinrich Schlusnuss hover in the vaporous ether to remind us of past perfection in lieder.<br /><br />Kaufmann has a big tenor that is strongly supported and baritonal in timbre. Yet he does know how to taper it down to lieder size -- not always smoothly but without noticeable strain. He has a romantic bent (the sappy cover photo didn't need to be so blatant about it) and satisfying artistry, honed by years spent with these songs. Essentially his approach is natural and direct. He doesn't think out each song to the smallest details, as Fischer-Dieskau did, and he lacks the depth of a Peter Pears. On his own terms, however, Kaufmann produces a compelling account. I'd wish for more variety at times. The songs tend to sound a bit uniform, cut from the same seensitive cloth, despite the fact that Schone Mullerin progresses from sunny ardency to tragedy. Another recent tenor, Werner Gura, made a deeper emotional impression on me. For the ultimate in a tenor version of the cycle, no one has approached Julius Patzak, whose account from the era of 78s makes a shattering impact from the very first song and achieves tragic catharsis by the end.<br /><br />That said, Kaufmann is a real artist, and his new version deserves to stand beside the one from Fritz Wunderlich, another natural, unfussy singer with romantic tendencies. We're not speaking of equality, but the comparison is still honorable. Helmut Deutsch, as usual, provides accompaniments that are proficient, impersonal, and far short of inspired.uality, but the comparison is still honorable.

0316069906|5.0|Jonathan Safran Foer has been a favorite author of mine for the 3 years I've known of him.  \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close: A Novel\\", was recommended to me by a friend.  My aunt sent me \\"Everything is Illuminated\\", and it seemed that \\"Eating Animals\\" was reviewed everywhere.  Amazon recommended it to me, but I'd read an article about it in Mens Health magazine.  The content was intriguing, and then I discovered it was by Safran Foer.      This novel is different from his others as it is more investigative and certainly not fiction.  I've heard of his involvement as a New Yorker contributing author, but I had never read anything other than his fiction.  He writes in a very matter of fact kind of way.  He is in no way preachy and presents the facts.  His views are made clear throughout, but it's in a very understanding sort of way.  I could tell that he's had to explain his dietary decisions to people before.  It's a shame someone with such a clearly ethical outlook has had to defend himself.  As he explains, though, this is not in defense to his already clear understanding of the way he views his choices.  This novel was written out of a desire to explain the need to understand why we do what we do.  Why do we eat animals?  Why do we treat them the way we do?  His goal seemed to be to tell the reader that it's not acceptable to live through life without an understanding of one's daily choices.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I watch it several nights a week as I am falling asleep. I never get tired of it. It is a great romance movie, full of comedy and I love all the actors in it. The two young girls are fantastic.

It's a movie the family could watch. Watch and enjoy!
0691142165|2.0|First I'd like to apologize to the authors for my lower than average rating, because the book has a very interesting topic, includes very nice materials and great researches that open a door to very broader perspectives about our current (2007-2009) global crisis. Just as the authors said, and I quote \\"Our analysis...raises many important questions (and provides considerably fewer answers).\\" That would fit perfectly into the books, in my standard, that are great and influential. However there are a few serious reservations that force me to lower my ratings, here are why:    1. The title is a little misleading, and reflects something about the handling. Even it claims \\"Eight Centuries of Financial Folly\\", more than 80% of the charts, tables, analysis are done for data from 1800, and to me, most important analysis are more focused on post-war crises and the Great Depression. If we do a weighted average, that's about 250 at most, for serious scientific research project like this, I will not dare to claim \\"eight centuries\\". No one should buy MSFT for 90 bucks if it's only worth around 30 or even 50. Well, I take it back, that's probably why we have crisis every 5-10 years the first place.    2. Forget about my joking, the most serious question, also implicitly inferred by above point, should be raised because of the data issue upon which the validities of some of the arguments based. The author utilized 800 years of data from 60+ countries, and just like the author said, a lot of data is very hard to collect, for instances, the domestic debt for most countries. For this huge ocean of data inflow, a lot are coming from other scholars from different background. Are those data consistent with author's research methods and processes? or they just a mixed bag? Based on the limited size of the book, I do not have satisfying answer yet. To have more data sample for better inferences or to have more data merely to appear to be convincing? I wish the author give more space to clarify that. The authors mentioned the famous work by Friedman & Schwartz, which I fortunately have a copy. In their monumental work, they studied on country about 100 years worth of monetary history, excluding appendix, they used about 700+ pages. Yet this book about 800 years, 60+ countries and their financial folly in all various kinds, is done within only less than 300 pages. They have great ideas, yet like one of previous reviews wrote, there are too many \\"we are going to show you that...\\", yet each such encounter, most often than none, makes me think that something after \\"that\\" might well be good for a single book of equal size. I'm kind of person who loves works that is thorough, detail, even just about a very simple problem, instead of those that touch everything and everything is still up in the air with a big question mark.    3. The third issue, yet not the least, is about the writing. This could well become fun instead, but it's like graduate school presentation, I show you a slide of graph or table, then a brief paragraph to list my point, ok then, wipe my hands and done. Here I always find a page or two tables/graphs, with just one paragraph, like the authors are always in a hurry to meet deadline of 3 minutes speech, here is the evidence, so this is important, now, next witness please....  Enough said, I would say a lot of important arguments are presented badly, and that makes you wonder whether certain conclusion is valid or not, like is there sample bias? or maybe in some analysis, there should done more to show that there is no Type II error, etc.    4. I could've given them close to 4 star, since there are a lot of useful questions and conclusions, and it is really a good starting point to help us understand more about crisis and their characteristics, but let me make some fun here, it's always good to claim that \\"this time is no different\\", at least as precaution against potential crisis. However, history might not always predict the future, especially when we stand on a different side, and say history might show that there is no crisis. Cut it short, at the end of the book, that the authors plot a graph to show that some candidates that is up for the \\"graduation\\" from domestic/external debt default/crisis, they state: \\"These include Chile, China, Greece, Korea, and Portugal\\", well, let me be bad and take hindsight, it seems it's very far for Greece and Portugal in today's environment, Korea just had some kind of currency issue last year. China is pegging heavily against dollar, and to use author's own conclusion, that could make the crisis more severe. So let's not be too harsh, and just count China and Korea as half correct each for now, that makes 2 out of 5? Not a pretty marksmanship, viola, here we are, the reason why I give 2 stars.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|On the White Album, the Beatles dabbled in just about every musical genre imaginable -- Vaudeville, Hard Rock, Country, Blues, Love Ballads, Children's Lullabies, Tongue-in-cheek Sarcastic Songs, and some tunes that can't be categorized. Musically, I've always thought that this body of work signalled the Beatles' impending breakup more than any other albums they later released. Even \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" come off sounding more like a group effort, rather than the highly individualized and somewhat haphazard lineup found here. Still, since the Beatles were after all the Beatles, there are moments of brilliance and amazing originality on The White Album that transcend whatever turmoil was going on behind the scenes. Also, the long overlooked contributions of George Harrison finally get due recognition as well; 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' is still one of the most georgeous, achingly poignant melodies ever recorded. The only thing that tops it is Harrison's acoustic version on The Beatle's Anthology 3.<br />I'm just thankful I never heard whatever Manson and his Family heard when listening to these double offerings.
B0000024JA|5.0|It's as if RZA's basement flooding, which \\"ruined\\" a whole bunch of beats, was a calling.  This production is *perfect* for Meth's style.  Its hazy.  It's murky.  It's heavy.  It's like quicksand.  Which are all perfect characteristics for not only the beats, but Method Man's flow.
0451228731|2.0|The best thing I can say about this novel is that it IS entertaining.      Unfortunately it's marred by clichés and bad writing.  Someone who thinks that there are gaming geeks who hang out at expensive impromptu raves in airplane hangers when they're not playing video games really needs to stop reading other bad cyberpunk novels and do a little more research about gaming culture.    Some of the killings are extremely contrived too with elaborate set-ups from someone who sure had a lot of foresight to know exactly what would happen and when....installing elaborate traps that even Jigsaw would be scratching his head at.    The characters are all two dimensional with names like \\"Decker\\" and speak the speak you'd find in films like The Matrix or anything by Jerry Bruckheimer.    It's also written for the lowest common denominator, so everything is explained twice.  Once in normal technical speak and a second time in a remedial explanation for someone who may not understand what an MMORPG is, for example.    So if you're looking for the next great cyberpunk novel, I'd look elsewhere.  Fortunately this book makes for a nice summer read on the beach when you don't want to have to use too many braincells.  It reads like one of those films you expected to be a piece of crap and were pleasantly surprised how entertaining it was even though it wasn't a masterpiece.
B002VECM4A|2.0|This movie should have a warning label!!!!!  It hit to close to home for me and I was depressed and should not have watched it!  But, All the actors was great!
B000WOWWXC|4.0|A few quick clarifications that might clear a few things up, before I begin.      A.  You may notice that there is also a \\"Frances the Mute-Single\\" available for download.  This was supposed to be the first track on the album however they didn't have enough room for it on the album.  It's also known as the decoder single.  If you really want to buy it (and it is a good piece), then buy it through itunes, because on here as a download it's 10$.  The lyrics are included though with the CD, behind the actual disc itself.    B.  If you are wondering about any appearances by the Chili peppers, John Frusciante plays the first two guitar solos on L'Via, and Flea plays Trumpet on the Widow, shortly before Omar's guitar solo. (according to the album's liner votes)    C. I bought this on CD, and if you, like me, were perplexed at first (when inserting it into your computer to rip), then you may notice that there are 12 tracks on the album, not 5.  In my case it had one song labeled as \\"Miranda that Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\", and the next three songs as the individual parts of \\"Miranda...\\".  The labeling is wrong, the three individual parts are the first three (of eight) parts of Cassandra Gemini.  The individual movements ARE NOT WHOLE BECAUSE THERE ARE FIVE MOVEMENTS, AND EIGHT PARTS on the CD.  On vinyl, Cassandra Gemini is split in the middle of the third movement, \\"Faminepulse\\"    Now if you are wondering why, this can be blamed on the record company.  They were going to pay the band (for the album) by number of songs, not length of them.  So they would have only been paid the price of an EP, so they broke up Cassandra into Eight parts.     D.  Because they split up Cassandra Gemini, none of the actual parts are intact, except Sarcohagi, which is complete.  Hazarding a guess at which of the eight tracks are which I would guess    Cassandra Gemini I (Tarantism I)  Cassandra Gemini II (Tarantism II and Plant A Nail In the Navel Stream I)  Cassandra Gemini III (Plant aNail in the Navel Stream II (and Possibly FaminePulse I))  Cassandra Gemini IV (Faminpulse I(I))  Cassandra Gemini V (Faminpulse II(I) and Multiple Spouse Wounds I)  Cassandra Gemini VI (Multiple Spouse Wounds II)  Cassandra Gemini VII (Multiple Spouse Wounds III)  Cassandra Gemini IIX (Sarcophagi)      All of this information I learned from the Wikipedia article on the album.  If you really want to know ALL the details, go directly to \\"Frances the Mute\\" in the search bar.  All the info is there.    Now to the actual review    I have every studio album the Mars Volta have put out.  I have not been a fan since the beginning, I heard about octahedron, tried it, and then went and got the rest of the albums in chronological order.    That said, this is the third Mars Volta album I have gotten.    To be perfectly honest, the only reason why this has 4 stars and not 5 is not because of the lengths of the songs, but the fact that there aren't really enough songs.  Cygnus is one song (maybe with a brief middle eight), same with the Widow, L'via, and Miranda, Cassandra Gemini (in theory) could be three; One for the Jazz/Jams, One for the two different themes circulating the song.    That said, the length of the songs is in some ways, unfortunate.  I am probably guessing that if they removed all the random sound effects, that Cassandra Gemini, and Lvia Lviaquez would remain the same in length.  Cygnus might be shortened by two minutes, and the same with the Widow.  Miranda... would probably be shortened by a good five or six minutes.  Frances the Mute (the song) might actually be on here, and be shortened by four minutes.    However, that does not in any way stop me personally from enjoying the album.  I like Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus, and Cassandra Gemini a lot, L'via and Miranda... seem like polar opposites to me.  Regarding the Widow, I had downloaded that months before I had bought the whole album, it was the first thing I had heard by them, but I have completely overplayedso I don't enjoy it as much.    Cassandra Gemini is actually very enjoyable if you have a large block of time on your hands, it really is quite interesting, along with all the other songs.    Compared to other albums, I would say that I am reminded of Pink Floyd's Animals (for the length), and the Wall (for the concept).  Musically this strikes me a lot as being similar to Rush, with the vocals, the lyrics, and the guitars, as well as in some cases the drum patterns, also in some parts (L'Via ) as being similar to Santana.    Also, for any King Crimson fans, \\"Miranda that Ghost just isn't Holy anymore\\" reminds me a lot of \\"Moonchild\\" and \\"Epitaph\\"    Overall, If you are new to the band, don't start here, start at Octahedron or Bedlam in Goliath, that way you don't put your expectations high and you can appreciate this more.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|The shipping was fast and the condition of the merchandise was perfect. This is a great film. It really brought the characters to life if only for a couple of hours and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Jane Austen and 19th century literature.
B000005J56|4.0|Usually when I write about Cuba in this space it is to review something about Fidel Castro, the July 26th Movement , or Che as part of the defense of the Cuban revolution and the struggle to break the American blockade that has lasted since the early days of the revolution and makes no sense whatsoever today. But enough of politics, as least direct politics, for a minute. Here I review the, mainly, pre-revolution music as it has survived in  post-revolutionary  Cuba. Ry Cooder  has produced this CD, as well as a well done film documentary, as part of an appreciation of the world music movement that has found a niche on the musical scene.            The centerpiece here is the `discovery' of the late Ibrahim Ferrer and the tradtional Cuban music associated with old Havana, with the old sangria religious rituals, and with the very real Buena Vista Social Club (a club house that has physically seen better days). Along the way we find that there is a very nice and thriving continuation of this old time music that Americans, for a time, got to hear as Ferrer toured the United States in the wake of the Cooder film documentary and the release of this CD. The booklet that accompanies this CD fills in the gaps about the sources of the music (in Cuban slavery/sugar cane days) and of the instruments used that are slightly different from the ones used here and also gives English translations of the Spanish lyrics. Dance away to this stuff.
B000K7UG34|5.0|This is one of my favorite VietNam movies. I like it better than Apocalypse Now and Platoon. I know that is blasphemy, but it's the truth. Mel Gibson is brilliant in this movie and I highly recommend this to everyone.
B000XA5K48|5.0|Of course this movie was over the top, but the action and humor were great.  It's nice to see the bad guys get blown away, and if this happens every two or three seconds, so much the better.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would watch it again.
B0035V35PI|4.0|I think this movie could have been MUCH better. I really think it was a great concept and Rain did a fantastic job, but it never got above being a guilty pleasure for me. Having said that, I love being entertained and this movie entertains me with the action scenes. It just isn't a great MOVIE.

0385480334|4.0|This book is about a young girl hiding with her family in a secret annex during the holocaust. It is very fascinating because these are her actual thoughts. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read because it fits all of the categories. This book has a very high rating on my list and I think it would entertain you too. It would pry be for someone older who likes reading because it is advanced.<br /><br />-Chris Tilley
1439153663|5.0|I absolutely loved this book...couldn't put it down.<br /><br />You will fall in love with the characters and share their joy, sadness, triumphs, and defeats...you will want to be right there with the ladies in the kitchen house preparing meals and being loved by them.<br /><br />The book is during the time of plantation owners and slavery. On his boat trip back from Ireland, James Pyke brought Lavinia with him...she is a seven-year-old white child whose parents died on the boat during the return trip.<br /><br />Lavinia is sent to work in the Kitchen House, and the black families learn to love her and she learns to love them as the only family she knows...her memory is gone when she arrives and remembers nothing about her parents and her childhood.<br /><br />Lavinia works alongside the ladies in the Kitchen House and then learns to take care of the Mistress of house's new born baby...the Mistress begins to teach Lavinia how to read and write. Lavinia is the main character along with Belle, Mama Mae and Papa George and of course the harsh plantation owners<br /><br />The book takes you through the loyalties the black families have for each other and their Master and his family. It also makes your heart ache at the truths of what really occurred on the plantations concerning the relationship between the slaves and the plantation owners.<br /><br />A lot of tragedies throughout the story, a terrific account of occurrences, excellent depictions of the surroundings and people.<br /><br />Through the author's wonderful descriptions, you feel you are right there......the novel is fabulously written.<br /><br />If you loved THE HELP, you will love this book as well or you may like it even more.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!! It is wonderful.

B0033G9OFA|1.0|I have been an avid doors fan since my early teens (now in my mid-40s). Over the years, I have purchased just about everthing Doors that I could get my hands on (all official Electra releases, bootlegs, VHS/DVDs, the Bright Midnight releases (including the much-maligned Matrix release) and the innumerable 'Best Of' releases. I have em' all but this one confuses me. Don't get me wrong, I can't wait to see the movie and will be purchasing the DVD  when it is released (hopefully with some bonus material) but this soundtrack escapes me. What we have here is YET another sampling of studio cuts that we all have heard, a couple live cuts that most (even casual) fans have seen/heard, and Johnny Depp reading Morrison poetry that is easily available from the man himself on American Prayer. So what is the point in this release? Who is it for? Can anyone tell me? Because I just don't get it...
031606792X|1.0|I swore I would never read any of these vampire fantasy books, but two of my (sane!) best friends finally convinced me to read them.  The first book, Twilight, is an extremely entertaining read, as I'm sure millions of girls and women would agree.  The next two are ok, with decent characters and plot.  But Breaking Dawn is HORRIBLE, and not just because of the obvious reasons - all the characters lose their personalities and everything gets wrapped up way too easily in a perfect shiny bow - but also because it is thinly veiled right-wing propaganda.  I don't appreciate having a Christian agenda shoved down my throat when I read a juicy novel, but I'm an adult and can think for myself.  What really worries me is young teenage girls reading this and taking in the following horrors as if they are a wonderful fairy tale:    --Bella wants nothing more than just to be with her man and have glorious fantasy sex with him on a secluded island forever.  Education?  A job?  Who needs them when you've got a hot rich husband to take care of you?  For the first part of the novel she's a vapid, empty-headed creature with no motivation other than sex - which Edward will occasionally consent to have with her, finally, because they're married.    --She gets pregnant with a baby that will kill her by chewing its way out of her womb with its TEETH, and refuses to let her doctor father-in-law abort it, even when it's tearing apart her insides, breaking her ribs, and causing her to drink human blood.      --For that negligent foolhardiness, she is rewarded with eternal life as a beautiful, infinitely wealthy, perpetual 18-year-old with an endless supply of gorgeous clothes and a Ferrari.  But who is she?  What does she do all day?  Nothing!  She spends her days with her adorable daughter, and the nights with her man.  Other than reading novels, she has no interests beyond her family, and she doesn't care about or need a college education because she has Edward.      Really???  This is the message Stephenie Meyer wants to send to teenagers?  Shame on her! Avoid this disgusting pulp.

0330509918|4.0|This is a fantastic read which tends to show the versatility of Follet as he deals with a German spy and his relationship with a very resourceful English lady.  \\"Eye of the Needle\\" is completely believable, and as more current data and information is released which exposes some of the clandestine activities conducted during WWII, one comes to believe almost anything is and was possible.

B00005NI5Y|5.0|Folks, you gotta check out the song 'Mississippi'. This man must have the same soul as Mr. John Lee Hooker (Check out Mr. Hooker's \\"The Healer\\"). While you're at it, see if you can get you a copy of Mr. Mississippi Fred McDowell's cd \\"You Gotta Move\\" 'You Gonna Be Sorry'. But be sure and give a listen to Mr. Hooker's 'Hobo Blue' (my favorite). There's a Blues history on DVD somewhere that includes some rare footage of Mr. Hooker doing this song back in the day, and it is awesome to witness.    Don't forget the electric Otis Rush,\\"Live In Concert From San Francisco\\" (killer blues solo). Big Bill Broonzy's \\"Big Bill's Blues\\", and Thomas 'Snake' Johnson's \\"Complete Recorded Works\\". Some Older, some more recent. All essential listening.    And Don't forget to watch the killer documentary on Mr. Bob Dylan, \\"No Direction Home\\" (2005).    I got a bonus disk with my copy of \\"Love and Theft\\" that includes a new updated version of \\"The Times They Are A Changin'\\". If this doesn't I'm sorry, because, The Times They Be A Changin' (Wink, Wink.)    \\"Everybody got to lose, somewhere.

0307454541|3.0|This book's first chapter makes a terrible mistake, in my opinion. It delivers a long and extremely boring chunk of back story to precede the main event. You may think the entire novel is as bad, but if you hang in there it gets better. I personally liked the female character, and found the male to be uninteresting. With Hoeg's Smilla, the Scandinavians seem to have a thing for eccentric female leads. Really, this novel is far too long for the sort of story it tells. A thriller shouldn't be War And Peace sized. Still, not too shabby.
0805091742|5.0|It is interesting how a book gets classified. I could not find this book in a major bookstore because I was looking in the business section. The patient and well-meaning lady at the counter took pity on me and informed me that this title was available in the Medical shelves.    This is  book that attracts all sorts of disciplines and so is quite an achievement. A well-meaning surgeon's desire to make his operations less prone to error is the well spring of inspiration for this book but then we are treated to all sorts of issues that follow with any protocol/procedure/checklist.    From the slums of Karachi to a water landing on the Hudson, this slim but pithy volume, keeps you riveted.    As an analyst, I now routinely follow a checklist at work. I make sure that I adhere to a daily plan and regularly check my analytical tools for alerts on various parts of the website and traffic performance. As part of this regular check I have found various analytical nuggets which would other wise be hidden in the mad dash through any given day.    So, everyone out there, make an ordered list of tasks that comprise your vocation; stick to it if it makes your work better; modify it if it does not. Just have something to hand so that you can refer to it!
1400064627|5.0|This was a simply fantastic novel.. filled with romance, humor, southern charm, and even death, it will tug at your heartstrings, make you laugh till you cry, and make sit on the edge of your seat.  After seeing the movie, I read this in one sitting, I just couldn't put it down!  Addressing topics from friendship and love to cannibalism, domestic abuse, death, and the KKK, this book is an absolute must read.  5 Stars.. if I could go higher, I would.   
B00275EGWY|5.0|A beautiful movie, incredibly well acted.  The Oscar it received for Best Picture is well deserved.  It shows a totally unknown part of the war and the amazing braveness of these men. It does not judge or take a political stance, it just shows what is.  Do yourself a favor, see this movie.
B0035V35PI|3.0|Good old school action in the vein of Lone Wolf and Cub. Story is BS. If you want violent action, its there. More a rental then a purchase.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|2012 is so full of inaccuracies that it is almost a comedy.  My wife and I and our friends laughed ourselves silly at some of the absolutely idiotic \\"facts\\" in this terrible movie.  How about \\"Mount Big Horn\\", the HIGHEST peak in Yellowstone Park at 2100 feet?!?!  The LOWEST elevation in Yellowstone is 5000+ feet and the highest is Eagle Peak at 11,000+ feet.  And how about the \\"boiling\\" mud pot made by throwing dry ice into a mud puddle?  The rest of this movie is so absurd as to defy description.  2012 is a lesson in how NOT to make a disaster flick or a sci-fi movie!  If you MUST watch this fiasco, be prepared for some good chuckles.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|I missed seeing this film in the movie, but I was thrilled  and totally engrossed in it.  There were twists, turns and  mouth dropping moments throughout the film.    This film is worth watching time and time again.  I've added it to my collection.      This is a keeper!    NJOY!

1416955070|4.0|Clary Fray is what you would call a normal teenage girl from Brooklyn. She likes art and hanging out with her best friend Simon. Clary goes to a night club one evening and suddenly her whole world changes. She witnesses three others her age murder what she thought was another teenage boy. It turns out the three murderers are Shadowhunters, warriors devoted to destroying demons, and that the seemingly obvious teenager was actually a demon trying to seduce one of the young Shadowhunters. Obviously he thought she was human; \\"He could smell her mortality, the sweet rot of corruption.\\" Within a day Clary's mother is kidnapped and Clary is attacked by a demon. It turns out Clary has the Sight, which means she can see the world of Shadowhunters, demons, witches, warlocks, vampires, werewolves, and other creatures of the faerie realm, a realm which is invisible to humans.     Clary is determined to do everything she can to get her mother back. In her quest Clary is pulled more and more into the world of her new Shadowhunter companions: the beautiful and dark siblings Isabelle and Alec, and the talented and charming Jace. Simon, although human, is also drawn into this dangerous world that before was real only in a child's nightmares. Through their search they discover Clary's mother was taken by the notoriously evil Shadowhunter Valentine who supposedly has been dead for the past sixteen years. They also discover that Clary's mother is really a Shadowhunter and that she has been hiding her dangerous past to protect her daughter. The mysterious question for readers is what is the connection between Clary and the most vicious killer who ever lived?     The book has the remarkable strength of capturing the reader right away with its immediate adventure and witty dialect. It is, however, reminiscent of Harry Potter for many reasons. The evil antagonist, Valentine, has the same purist ideals that Voldemort seemed to have. There is also parallelism with the first letters of theirnames, as well as with both the stories' label for humans-\\"mundanes\\" and \\"muggles.\\" Overall this book is very enjoyable and I plan on reading the rest of the series. However, if you are looking for something more original, you should probably keep looking.
1401923119|2.0|Lipton's study of the human cell and the connection with belief looked like a good read so I purchased it. After reading it, I found it to be nothing more than a biology lesson on the human cell and a Bio.  You will get more out of reading books by A.Robins, N.Hill, Dr. H.Benson and others that give you practical information that you can use to help yourself, not like Lipton that sends you over to Psych-k for the understanding and healing that you thought this book would give you.
055357342X|5.0|NOT your typical fantasy book.    Uglier and grittier than Palahniuk,    More enthralling than Dan Brown    As profoundly imaginative and descriptive as Heinlein    As intelligent as Pullman    Basically the series I've been waiting my whole life for.    Reasons not to buy this book:    1) You are young  This is an immensely realistic tale with full, rich characters. They are as real as it gets. I read the first book some years ago and it didn't sit with me until I had gained a few years experience under my belt. I feel a certain level of life experience is needed to truly appreciate this book.    2) You like cookie cutter stories with good vs. evil.  If you're the kind of person who likes to hate the bad guy, and love the good guy, you might want to stick with Harry Potter. There is no right or wrong in this book, only perspective. Wide, gaping perspective that will lead a dozen different readers to a dozen different conclusions.    3) You are blind and/or Deaf  That's really the only real excuse not to read these books.
B001O2MBMI|5.0|I really enjoyed the sound of this album from Leona! She's got a beautiful voice and on the track \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" is a treat to hear. Her rendition is very beautiful. And the album is great because it is quite uplifted as found with many tracks found on here but in particular with \\"Footsteps in the Sand\\" & \\"Here I Am\\".<br /><br />But there are a lot more tracks on here that are a good listen as well such as \\"Take a Bow\\" & \\"Bleeding Love\\".

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Evangelion is back and more vivid than ever.  For those who are new to this series, its best if you start off with the t.v. series because you will be lost trying to understand this one.  This is meant for the fans that know whats going on with the whole angels, eve, son of adam and so fourth.  A lot of the scenes were cut in order to squeeze in the important parts of the show.  For example, they focused on the main characters and their personalities rather than his classmates or co-workers at nerv who all have a little backround of their own, but you won't see that in 1.11.  Other than that lets get to the good stuff.  This movie puts 4 or 5 episodes into one so far.  The whole thing is redrawn with extended and new scenes added and extra features for the angels as well as the eva's.  The eva's now have a new disturbing roar when going berserk, and the angels have halos over them now (just some cool little features if you observe closely).  1.11 is the way to go, the difference with 1.0 is like night and day.  1.0 is poorly converted to dvd quality, the scene when shinji first pilot his eva is so dark all you can see is the green glowing from the eva and thats the first fight scene.  1.11 fixed that right up, its crisp and clear in the blu ray, I haven't seen the dvd version of 1.11 but im sure its the same.  Fans of Evangelion need to pick this one up wether for you collection or to refresh your memory either way you wont be disappointed.  Just remember this is a movie series.  Meaning its an actual movie it just gonna come in parts, I think four movies in total.

The author very effectively does a number of things in this book:    i) Highlights the conceptual differences between Ruby and other currently popular languages    ii) Shows how those conceptual differences are expressed in programming constructs by walking the reader through a number of small but realistic example problems    iii) Reviews internal details of a number of pieces of real-world software (most notably Rails) to show how the authors of these packages use the techniques he describes to solve their problems    iv) Provides a number of helpful and applicable guidelines on how to 'think in Ruby'      v) Generates a GoF style catalog of implementation patterns     vi) Skewers the notion that 'metaprogramming' is any different than regular programming    After finishing this book I have a real appreciation of the techniques the author describes, and how they can be used to write flexible, powerful, and maintainable software.  Before reading this book I was aware of a number of these techniques, but I didn't necessarily understand how they could be effectively used to solve real problems.  Now I do.  The book truly covers how to think in Ruby - how to naturally solve problems in Ruby, as opposed to adapting techniques commonly used in languages from the C/C++/Java lineage.     The one major criticism I had of Metaprogramming Ruby was the 'fanboy' tone that permeates a lot of the text.  Frequently the author seems more interested in getting you to agree with him that Ruby is great than in conveying the concepts being discussed.  There are a lot of gratuitous slams of other languages (especially Java) that were frankly unnecessary and distracted from the book.  Had the tone of those comparisons been a little more highbrow and a little less schoolyard, this would have been a better book.    Overall rating: 4.5 stars
B000WJSCZE|5.0|I've just finished \\"Presentation Zen\\" by Garr Reynolds. This book is also available in Russian, but the cover of the Russian edition makes me sick: it destroys the main idea of the book before you even open it! I can speculate that translation is poor too, so please, if you choose to read this particular book - go get the original one.<br /><br />At first glance this book is not a how-to guide. But on the other hand it really is a step-by-step instruction, which helps you do your best. In fact, to understand Mr. Reynold's advice, ideas and approach in making and presenting presentations you have to understand all this Zen stuff. It was all new for me, all this \\"less is better\\" and other ideas (by the way, you can find most of this Zen ideas in Steve Jobs presentations and in most of Apple's products). However, this book is more about philosophy of making better things, than about preparing presentations in PowerPoint, Keynote or whatever.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said before, this is the step by step instruction. Instruction of how not to make presentations and instruction of how to make something memorable, bright, useful and nice. Even if you never use any slideware, you'll get some interesting ideas of presenting yourself to the audience, or techniques of introducing your ideas to public, or (OMG!) ideas of how to use slideware properly! :)<br />What's your favorite site with book reviews? ;)<br /><br />Also, pay attention to Kindle format: Kindle DX is ok for this book - you'll see all the examples, but on the ordinary Kindle (2 gen) some of the pictures won't show.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|A good amount of action and impressive CGI bolsters this remake which to be honest flags a bit at times.<br />Even an A list cast, and Sam Worthington (fresh from Avatar and Terminator Salvation) unfortunately can't lift it above average.<br />The usual debate ensues about the 3D added as an afterthought, and whether it adds anything, I saw the 2D version so can't comment on that, although I noticed a couple of scenes obviously deliberately designed with the 3D medium in mind.<br />On a side note, if 3D is going to be the new gold standard, then please filmmakers, stop using every opportunity to have things fly out of the screen for a cheap effect. Avatar was good in 3D exactly because it did not exploit the audience, but I digress.<br />Most people who remember Harry Hamlin et al in the 1981 original will not be able to help but make comparisons, and the storyline and chronology is quite similar.<br />However, whereas I would not have said the original was a deep drama, it had a far more solid story, and makes this updated CGI festival pale in comparison.<br />As much as I like Sam Worthington, he was wooden most of the time, pausing between action sequences to deliver  \\"man against the Gods\\" speeches, which he fails to carry off each time with any conviction.<br />The biggest difference in the two movies is of course that the first was a love story.<br />Perseus, driven by his love for Andromeda (the beautiful and delicate Judy Bowker) has a passion, that is missing here somehow. As Perseus is merely on a vendetta against Hades.<br />The feud and story with Calibos was much more integral to the plot than here also, where this time around that character seems to be little more than a disgruntled mercenary working for Hades.<br />I'm not going to delve into the story any more than that, so no spoilers.<br />It is a good two hours of escapism, and fun to watch Liam Neeson, and Ralph Fiennes as Zeus, and Hades respectively chewing up scenery at every given opportunity.<br />Probably the last of the stop motion classics involving the great Ray Harryhausen, the original movie looks laughable in comparison to today's effects, but as we have seen so often, effects alone don't always mean a great movie.<br />Sure to do well at the box office, it is a visual feast if nothing else, and although I don't agree with some of the scathing reviews it's received from the media, and film critics, it did fall short of my expectations. 3.5 Stars.sics involving the great Ray Harryhausen, the original movie looks laughable in comparison to today's effects, but as we have seen so often, effects alone don't always mean a great movie.

0385737424|5.0|I love Madeleine L'Engle and her book A Wrinkle In Time. This book makes numerous references to both. When I met Madeleine L'Engle at a conference a few years ago she stated that her characters are alive to her, and every now and again she will realize something new happened in their life. This book has that feel; as I read it, and even after finishing, I found myself thinking about the characters - where they are now, what they are up to. I think L'Engle would have loved that about this book.<br /><br />The story takes place in a very small geographic region in New York City, focusing around a 6th grade girl Miranda, her friends and family. She finds a note indicating that the author is trying to save her friend's life and their own life. The author of the note indicates that they know the future and give her dates and times of events yet to happen to prove they are telling the truth. What they are asking for in return is that Miranda tells them her story, specifically that she write it out and when the time comes she will know who to give it to.<br /><br />The story is wonderfully written from Miranda's perspective, looking back on the past few months. It is about lifting the veil between what we perceive and what is real, what is actual and what is possible. It is about the potential in humans for growth and change. C.S. Lewis stated \\"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.\\" This book helps to wipe some of the dirt and grime off the glass and allows us to see a little more clearly. Yes it is true the story became predictable, especially for a fan of L'Engle, but the way it happens still makes it worth reading. It is a wonderful book - a book about hope, a book about change and a book about coming into yourself. If Stead's writings continue to ask questions like this one, does she have the potential to become a favourite author of mine, and maybe even a legend like L'Engle?
0312330537|5.0|Not very often a book comes along and takes hold of your heart like this one does. I wanted so badly to never put this book down but instead forced myself to take it slowly and digest every morsel of information, every description, every new emotion it provoked. I didn't mind that Lin became the one that everyone loved too much, I was too involved in the escape to some far off land so different from my own in a way that I was right there too. I loved this book; I will have to look far and wide to find another I'd enjoy as much.
B001FB55L2|4.0|When I rented this I wasn't aware that it was a remake of a Danish movie of the same name, i.e. [[ASIN:B000ADWDF2 Brothers]] and though I have yet to watch the Danish version (I plan to), I thought the American remake was credibly acted by the three lead actors. The story focuses on the Cahill family - Captain Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire in a compelling and finely nuanced role) loves his wife Grace (Natalie Portman who is amazing as always) and his two young daughters and is also strongly connected to his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal). As Sam gets ready to be deployed to Afghanistan, Tommy is released from prison for robbing a bank. When Grace receives news that Sam died in a helicopter crash somewhere in the mountains of Afghanistan, it is Tommy who looks in on her and the girls and forms a close relationship with the kids. There is a certain amount of chemistry between the still grieving Grace and the turned-over-a-new-leaf Tommy who finally seems to have a purpose.<br /><br />But it turns out that Sam is not dead after all - he returns from Afghanistan emotionally empty and psychologically damaged. His young daughters no longer feel comfortable around him and seek out Tommy's company instead. Grace is at her wits' end as to how to cope with this stranger in her life, not realizing the dark and tortured secret Sam carries within him. Sam, in his anguish, turns upon those he loves, accusing Grace and Tommy of having an affair and things quickly go downhill.<br /><br />What makes this a watchable drama is the compelling and credible performances by the three lead actors, i.e. Maguire, Gyllenhaal, and Portman. Maguire convinces us of the harrowing effects of war on the human psyche and of how this in turn impacts families - this is a situation that is very relevant given current events. Gyllenhaal also turns in a fine performance as the younger brother who is deemed a failure by many, yet manages to turn his life around. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Portman is strong and in fact, I felt that their relationship seemed more credible than the one portrayed between the husband and wife. Portman delivers a heartrending performance as the devoted and confused wife who struggles to help her husband through his crisis. The young actors who portray the daughters are amazing, especially the actor playing the older daughter who convincingly emotes all her confusion and sadness at this strange and scary person who once used to be a loving and fun father. There is one scene around the family dining table which sees all the anger, hurt, and confusion  convincingly portrayed and which left a strong impression on me. All in all, this is a compelling movie about how a soldier copes with the harrowing effects of war, and of its impact on those close to him.fact, I felt that their relationship seemed more credible than the one portrayed between the husband and wife.

B000002L3P|3.0|Okay, this kid can play. There is no doubt about it: If he actually made the music on this disc he can play and he can sing. There are some pretty good original songs on here too. I really liked \\"Let me Up (I've Had Enough).\\" There is something tacky about the whole thing, however. I didn't like the photo of \\"Kenny with his first guitar - age 9,\\" nor the statement from James Brown about how \\"Kenny Wayne Shepherd has soul.\\" Both were clearly marketing tactics, attempts to try and sell this kid. I say let the music speak for itself.    And the music sounds too much like Stevie Ray Vaughan to give Kenny all that much credit. From the very first chords, it was perfectly clear who he was trying to play like. His version of \\"I'm Leaving You (Commit a Crime)\\" was practically identical to Stevie Ray's. I hear that now he is TOURING WITH STEVIE RAY'S BAND, and closing his shows with a Version of \\"Voodoo Chile.\\" Well, sorry kid! Let's hear something original.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|I WATCHED THE MOVIE 2 TIMES AND THE 1ST TIME I WAS A LITTLE DISAPOINTED. The movie should have been another 40 or so minutes longer. No nudity or profanity or dirty jokes. Just some good action and great special effects. My 2 boys just loved it as i did. The acting was very good. The costumes were great. The only shortfall was the length of the movie. For the life of me i cannot understand why they made the movie so short.

B002ONC9NC|4.0|The setting for this film is England in the 1960's.  \\"An Education\\" is appealing and warm because of the role of Jenny (played by Carey Mulligan).  Her personality bubbles throughout.  Jenny is a 17 year old student, popular, smart, and searching for happiness in her small world.  Jenny is an only child that plays a cello, enjoys classical music and has trouble learning Latin.<br /><br />She soon meets a dashing man of the world, David (Peter Sarsgaard), who has a dubious occupation and charming friends.  He wines her and dines her, presenting a world of travel, jazz clubs, excitement and laughter.  There is an affair of sorts, blessed by doting parents who think he has high connections and wealth.  Jenny and her parents grow to admire and enjoy David's company and laughter.<br /><br />In \\"An Education,\\" the boredom of the classroom gives stark contrast to the vibrant times and expensive gifts of her new love.  Jenny quits school after a rant to the headmistress (Emma Thompson).  Jenny exclaims she is bored with school and just wants to have fun, enjoy what the world has to offer her.<br /><br />As she moves on, another lesson of life hits her.  Jenny and her parents are devastated when a truth is revealed.<br /><br />\\"An Education\\" is is a fabulous story of lessons learned, in real life and in books.

1602836582|3.0|The audiobook, which I purchased, uses the old school craft of radio drama combined with a master spy story. All characters have unique voices with realistic personalities. There are sound effects such as bottles and glasses, doors, cars, the beach and sirens.<br /><br />I don't recommend the audiobook because it the acting wasn't performed nearly as well as the movie, and the print version is also better.<br /><br />The story doesn't glorify anything although it probably is a draw for Cold War history buffs. Those \\"in the game\\" are in it for the game, not ideals. At their professional level, this would make sense. There's really not much glamour depicted about the personal lives of spies.<br /><br />I can see why this story became a popular traditional spy story. The plot moves very quickly, the characters take the spotlight but only long enough to carry a scene here and there. I never guessed what was going to happen next. The ending was abrupt yet meaningful.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This movie was amazing.. I am not waiting 8 months for the one with the special features to come out. 3D TV's are NOT all that great. That is something i'm definitely waiting on. At home 3D quality need to improve. I'm choosing to wait 3 weeks vice 8 months
B001JNNDBA|3.0|First off:  I love this movie.  Don't really care for the director's cut.  I like the ambiguity and mystery of the original version.  The director's cut feels a little too pat and dull to me.    This review however is about the Blu-Ray version.  In short, I'm not really sure it's worth the money to invest in the Blu-Ray.  In comparing the DVD image quality to the Blu-Ray, there is very little discernable improvement with the Blu-Ray, and that's the whole point in having a film on blu-ray.  So if you have the DVD, I'd just stick with that.  Besides, the DVD has excerpts from the Time Travel book, and that is not included in the Blu-Ray edition.

B001OQCV6A|3.0|Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law make a great team in this cheerfully revisionist update of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's immortal creation. Though director Guy Ritchie's hyperkineticism occasionally falters and the heavily rewritten screenplay fails to fulfill its potential, the movie is never dull. In fact, this 2009 incarnation feels like a Victorian-era version of \\"The Wild Wild West\\" (and I mean that as a compliment). Downey's fitfully eccentric interpretation of the iconic detective is well-matched by Law's refreshingly non-bumbling Dr. Watson. \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" will not satisfy Doyle purists, but the results are jolly good fun.

9562919897|5.0|I will not comment too much on the content of this book - I believe that there is already substantial evidence that the content is valuable and although some may say that it is common sense, I am amazed as to how many people and writers make the simple and basic mistakes that the book points out.  I bought this book to write essays for graduate schools and the principles have already proven helpful and insightful.<br /><br />A quick note on the physical aspects of the book - as another reviewer pointed it, the pages do look like they were photocopied and the font type looks old-fashioned.  However, for a price point of $3, there is little to complain about and if you want a better looking book (with the same content), just search for the more expensive versions of this book on Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I would highly recommend this specific version of the book if all you are looking for is the solid writing principles that the book provides.

It's fast paced, and only take a short time, making it easy to complete when having a family at home. I definitely recommend this!
B00275EGWY|3.0|I was disappointed. I was expecting more genuine combat scenes, I thought it was over dramatic.

I was disappointed in the dialog between the soldiers.

WOW again -- I have no idea how they made it so clear, crisp and colorful, without making it look made over!  It was perfect in performance and quality.

B002VECM6S|3.0|The director (who also adapted the book for the screen) took some liberties with this story, in ways that I think may have been well-intended but could be perceived as offensive.      My biggest complaint is this: I don't think that the real Michael Oher was nearly as unsophisticated as the movie portrayed him.  He had played high school football (for one year at a public high school and for awhile at the christian academy) before living with the Tuohy family.  So the whole sequence where Michael is learning how to play football seems a bit Disney-fied.  I am sure that the real Michael Oher was not simply born with the kind of abilities he has; clearly, he put in honest work into honing his craft even before he met the Tuohy family.   Ignoring that hard work is a disservice to the real Michael Oher as much as it is a disservice to everyone who has tried to accomplish something great, and sends a message to its intended audience (assuming the Disney-fication was meant to appeal to kids) that in order to succeed, you must be born with \\"protective instincts\\", adopted by a wealthy family, attend a private christian academy, and hope that some bossy southern lady shows you how to play ball.  In other words, it's all a matter of luck, kids.      My second complaint:  the book is far more interesting, especially in its treatment of the evolution of offensive football strategy over the last three decades.  The movie barely touches on football strategy; instead, football is a vague idea in the background.  Sure, the first two minutes or so had that sharp voice-over about left tackle and Lawrence Taylor, followed by a shot of Michael walking through the projects; and at that point, I thought, great, they followed the book, they're running with this metaphor.  But that's where the football ended and that a two-hour cliche about the importance of family began.     Now, I'm not saying I don't enjoy the occasional two-hour cliche about the importance of family, and I'm really nota huge fan of football.  I just think that, in this case, the material (both the true life story of Michael Oher and the book by Michael Lewis) deserved far better than how this movie turned out.
B00005JMX6|3.0|Well, I do understand why a teenage boy might give this film five stars. However, the rest of us (and that does include teenage girls), have likely figured out how to use pay-per-view (a.k.a. more skin for the same price). So, if you take away the \\"skin factor\\", what else does \\"Girl Next Door\\" have to offer? A compelling story, perhaps? Funny, previously unheard jokes? Superb acting? Well... none of the above, actually.<br />The plot:<br />A high school senior, top student with a bright future, almost looses it all when his new neighbour and the object of his affections turns out to be a porn star. A gesture, meant to stear the young woman away from her chosen career, puts in jeopardy not only the boy's entry into college, but maybe even his very life and freedom.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the one entertaining factor in this far fetched story comes in the form of Timothy Olyphant as a porn producer and the porn stars ex. It is the part that challenges my previously grim view of the man's acting skills. His very appearance: the plaid pants, the crazy hair, the five pounds of jewelry, is chuckle worthy. His character seems dim witted and affable one minute, and sly, slick and sinister the next... The part disserves to be plucked out of this flick, and landed in something far more interesting then the \\"Girl Next Door\\" (oops! ;o) ).<br />Verdict: if you don't have cable, haven't had a date in a long time, and can lower your expectations just low enough, take out the \\"Girl Next Door\\". You may get a few laughs... Just don't expect to fall in love...

1416572287|4.0|Understanding quantum physics is a challenge, even for the keener students. But it's worth it, offering scientific, even philosophical, perspectives in new and diverse fields. Chad touches on these but is alert to snake oil salesmen. This book tells it straight and does not indulge turkeys (or evil squirrels). The explanation through discourse is a tried and true method, pioneered in the case of Galileo with fellow humans. Emmy's canine musings provide Chad with a wealth of useful examples to clarify theories.<br /><br />Many authors tackle quantum physics at an introductory level and attempt the difficult task of explaining a mathematical subject without maths. A strength of this shorter book is the option to easily reread a point that did not sink in. There can be no pretence that quantum physics is any other than a mathematical world that can defy comprehension. Accessible books like this one are the rabbit that will entice future physicists into that field. Views on quantum theory vary as do teaching methods, so readers can improve their grasp by reading similar introductory books. A sometimes different treatment of many of the same topics, with a focus on glossy artwork rather than canine prerogative, is Jim Al-Khalili's Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed.
B000006YMP|5.0|This  CD is worth buying for the title track alone. \\"Wrap Your Arms Around Me\\" is the most beautiful love song I have ever heard. It is absolutely spine tingling. Agnetha's voice is an incredible instrument.
B00383YC2S|4.0|Forget what you know about Alizée! That is the first thing. I really liked her previous albums and that may have actually been a hindrance to enjoying this one at first because the music and even her singing style is very different. I'm more a fan of regular instrumental music. Once I got into it though, I found a real appreciation for some of the songs. This album is VERY catchy and will get into your mind and stick there. You decide if that's good. :)    This album, it turns out, has some real gems, such as my favorite, Factory Girl, which starts off with an epic style movement and Alizée just carries it right throughout the song, or the first track which will instantly transport you as soon as Alizée starts singing it, Eden, Eden. In spite of light and poppy electronica music, there is a profundity or seriousness to this album that didn't exist on her previous albums (albeit perhaps a few songs on Psychédélices), though she still has some really sweet sounds. Parts of À Caeur Fendre even sound a lot like Adélaïde to me at least as she sang it (as I recall the latter). At first I didn't like Limelight all that much, but now I understand the \\"epic flavor\\" they were trying to give it (in the full album version). It really helps the album once you \\"get it\\". I think she is trying to push the boundaries of what \\"Alizée sounds like\\".  It very much reflects her 25 years of age I think. How can anyone who gives her a chance not fall in love at least a little bit with her voice? :)    Except for maybe one track, this album really puts her voice forward, on top of the music and that gives a weight to it that I think plays really well (especially for those who love Alizée). :P  For example, if not for the way Alizée sings Mes Fantômes, it would just be a really simple song with not much to comment, but because of how she sings it, and actually the excellent way it was mixed, you may find yourself really falling into it. This song is another that will instantly surprise you as soon as you hear her voice.    I thought the music video for Les Collines was very good. It was edited very well for the song, establishes well the image of the album, her image as it is being portrayed for this album, and speaks to the theme of the album: Edie Sedgwick, The Factory Girl--muse of Andy Warhol. Moreover, it was a great choice for the first single because the music really gets \\"hyped up\\" at parts. Good energy.    In spite of a couple really deep songs and quite likable others, for continued listening, I do wish the album was a bit more dynamic. Musically it does not cover a lot of ground. Some say this is a good thing because it has a consistency to it that really makes it play well as a whole, but it gets old quicker for me because in general it's a bit \\"slow\\". Maybe I have little patience! I think the songs hang together better in the context of the album, but at the same time I find it easier to fall into and appreciate them individually.     It seems to me that music for this album has great potential to be really amped up and played around with a lot for a concert without ruining the essence of the song. They could just go crazy with some guitar or synthetic music and make the music really explode with instrumental interludes and so forth! That could be really awesome for a fan! That thought alone really makes me want to go to a concert.
B000VBIEXS|5.0|Realistically - This album is for the \\"Musician's Musician.\\"  This album was created at the dawn of the digital age.  Therefore, it's kind of easy to forget about it's message and alas, drift into it's brilliant effects.<br /><br />So all you have to do is just enjoy it.  Don't think about it.  Just enjoy it's musical brilliance.  There is a subliminal theme of humanity's resistance to machines - taking over and so fourth.  Sort of sounds like what we deal with today!  Nothing new.<br /><br />Experience the new adventure of synthesized sounds of the day, back then around 1973.  That would be my advice.  I like Greg Lake's voice layered with these sounds.  It's classic.  I hope you like it too.
B000LPZFK4|4.0|Love this car!  I was waiting for years for SOMEBODY to make an accurate toy Delorean from the movie-especially one with the wheels coming up so that they toy flies.  It's made of metal so it's pretty durable...until your son gets a hold of it and some of the plastic parts that are glued on come off.  Oh, well.  Live and learn.  Still looks cool even after all of these years of having it.  Still take it down sometimes and play with it, but my son plays with his Hot Wheels version from now on.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I've seen reruns of the original Star Trek series, watched all the movies since, but this one, I felt, far bypassed the others. Interesting to see younger versions of Capt. James Kirk, Spock, Bones, Uhura, Scottie, Sulu and Chekhov. All of the actors playing these parts greatly resemble their characters in later years. We learn about Kirk's mother and father, how Kirk got into the academy and eventually commanded his own Star Ship. The plot is centered around an embittered Romulun who blames the Vulcans for his family's demise and his attempts to obliterate the Vulcan race and their planet. Leonard Nemoy makes an appearance as the future Spock which is a big mind-bending - how can a present and future person coexist together? But all in all, this is a thoroughly entertaining, action-packed movie. I hope future movies are planned of the early years of the officers of the USS Enterprise.
B003DRWX9I|5.0|Amazon, are you crazy?  This mp3 download is only 50 cents cheaper than the cd!  Let me think- no cost to amazon for the physical cd, liner art/notes, or shipping (I always take advantage of your wonderful free shipping).  Inferior sound quality- I love the convenience of downloading mp3's, but cd's do sound better.  Plus, if I spend the extra 50 cents, all I have to do is rip it to my computer and I have the mp3 and the cd as a backup.  Guess I'd rather have the cd.  But wait, I want it today, so I think I'll go to the local wm and buy the cd for 2 dollars more than your mp3 price.  I really, really love you Amazon.  And I do buy a lot of stuff from you (especially music).  But someone there really needs to review your (or the publishers) pricing policies.  By the way- same goes for most of your kindle book prices.  Usually paperbacks are cheaper.  The 5 stars is for Slash, my fav guitar play, not Amazon (in this case).

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Return To Oz came out when I was only 3 years old. One of my earliest memories is of seeing this in the theater. My sister and I would beg our parents to rent the video out through out the late '80s until somebody finally taped the movie for us. Yet, it was frustrating to me as a child that this movie didn't \\"go\\" with The Wizard of Oz. Where were the songs? Why was Dorothy younger? Why did Uncle Henry have a beard? Where did the farm hands go? And most importantly, why did the Scarecrow have \\"golf ball\\" eyes? I was well grown before I realised this movie isn't really a sequel to the 1939 film. The title may indicated that it's a sequel, but don't let that fool you. It's a film all on it's own. (In my eyes,  if it's to be called a sequel, it's to a film that was never made.) And the truth is, it's much more enjoyable when you aren't fretting that it doesn't go with the other film. Sure, there are those ruby slippers, but other than that this is based on the L. Frank Baum books (which I am a huge fan of.) As far as people saying that this is closer to the spirit of Baum's OZ, I wonder if they read the same books that I did. Yeah, there were no floating Glinda bubbles or the \\"it was all a dream\\" ending, but I fail to remember Oz being dark. I mean, it wasn't all sunshine and lollipop guilds, but it was never this gloomy. And like The Wizard of Oz, some things are lost in translation or added that weren't in the books. As neat and terrifying as that Nome King is, he is hardly what is described in the books, which is a short fat rock colored Santa Claus type. (And if that is Santa Claus, I sure as heck wouldn't want him coming down my chimney!) That aside, the makers of this film did try to make the characters look like the John R. Neill illustations. I would rank this as one of my favorite films.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Holy Cow! I've watched this movie last night and I am still in shock.<br />I didn't order the dvd, I watched it online so I won't review the item or shipping, but the movie itself is very informative and scary at the same time.<br /><br />One reviewer complained about the fact there was no scientific experts. Well, knowing that the FDA had among its members ex-employees from Monsanto or other Companies (who returned working for them), I wouldn't fully trust the experts, unless they are independent, which won't really happen. How independent or free are we? We cannot even know if we're eating meat from cloned animals because the Big Companies don't want to \\"scare\\" people? We cannot have all the information to make our decision. We cannot even say \\"I won't eat this or that\\" because the Food Companies can sue anybody because it hurts their business? And what about our health ??<br /><br />How is soda cheaper than water? How is a burger cheaper than ONE red bell pepper? (hamburger 1$, 1 red bell pepper $1.89 in Houston, and it's not even organic!?).<br />Where do these E.Coli outbreaks come from? How come cows don't even eat grass anymore? How come the FDA is powerless and cannot event close down a \\"factory\\" which had E.coli contamination? Why? why? why?<br /><br />Almost 2 years ago, we watched \\"the world according to Monsanto\\" and I was disgusted by their way of doing business, hurting financially the farmers, changing our food, the official regulations etc... and so we made some personal changes.<br /><br />After watching \\"Food Inc\\", I won't turn vegetarian or \\"hippie\\" but for sure, I'll pay even more attention to what we eat and how the food is produced. I hope the American People will wake up and fight for the right to have better food and better information, otherwise, I am afraid the next step might be \\"soylent green\\"...

B002UNMW7O|3.0|Couldn't they afford to hire a better actress, especially one that would replace the amazing Willem Dafoe? At least they could have hired her a decent vocal coach so she didn't sound completely ridiculous with that phony southern accent. It totally wasn't believable that she was his protege--even he didn't seem to like her! There was no chemistry between them whatsoever; they should have just let Willem be in the whole movie.<br />I really liked the movie--it was funny, and the action was great (though Flanery looked like he used a little too much Botox). If they had cut Benz out, it would have been so much better--personally, I think she's a terrible actress, especially in Dexter (which was probably the only reason she got in this movie).<br />Her character was not endearing whatsoever; she was far too condescending and wasn't funny at all, not even remotely like Willem in the first movie. They should have gotten Charlize Therone, she would have been perfect, and the audience would have respected her.<br />Troy Duffy made a serious mistake hiring Benz to play the LEADING female role--he really made her look goofy in the crime scene replays (especially in the cowboy outfit), scenes that made the first movie so unique and made the second movie look ridiculous. I seriously hope she doesn't make it to the third movie.

0385504225|4.0|In Dan Brown's latest Robert Langdon thriller, Langdon is rushed to Washington D.C. as a last-minute guest speaker at the request of his mentor, Peter Solomon. When he arrives however, the truth is revealed: Solomon, a prominent member of the secret Mason organization, has been kidnapped, and only Robert can solve the riddle of the infamous Masonic Pyramid to find the key to the Ancient Mysteries which the kidnapper demands before it's too late. Matched up with Solomon's sister, Katherine, and pitted against the CIA themselves, Langdon is once again in a race against time to save the world... and himself.<br /><br />We all know by now that Dan Brown can write a darn good thriller. But what distingushes him from all the wannabes? What makes him better than the rest? The level of detail he he creates, the intricate plots, the twisted clues, and the fact that everything he writes could actually be true... and probably is. Other writers do research and posit interesting theories about secrets hidden in our culture, lost cities and ancient temples. But Brown makes them look like amateurs. Similar to Angels & Demons and The DaVinci Code, Brown has woven a tangled web of conspiracy set in truth, this time all around Washington D.C.<br /><br />Like a shepherd leading his flock to a source of nourishment, Brown opens the reader's eyes to clues set in our very midst; to ancient prophecies and wisdom handed down from the ages. Revealing everything piece by intricate piece, one can hardly read his evidence without believing some of it to be true. And that is what makes him better than the rest. Six years lay between the release of The DaVinci Code and the unveiling of The Lost Symbol. Does Brown's genius make as big of an impact this time around? Maybe not as much now that we've come to expect it. But that doesn't make it any less intense.<br /><br />My only fault with The Lost Symbol was the ending. Overly long and fairly dull, fifteen pages of resolution and exposition, combined with a heaping dose of religious symbolism, could have been crunched into ten. Sleepily I trudged through the final pages wondering if anything else was going to \\"happen.\\" Alas, it was a struggle with no entertaining reward. But it was informative and visual.<br /><br />Overall, I'm still impressed with Dan Brown and Robert Langdon. I will happily wait another six years if it means his next book is as well researched and enigmatic as The Lost Symbol.<br /><br />4 stars<br /><br />(I bought this book with my own dough)of religious symbolism, could have been crunched into ten.

0802473156|5.0|I read this book a few years ago before I was married after a friend suggested it to me.  I thought...\\"Wow this is really great information!  Every single person should read this!\\"  I purchased a copy now and we're rereading it together this time.  On a personal note, I can relate my communication issues I have with my husband to the people discussed in the book.    If you don't have the opportunity to read it with your partner, reading it alone would definately improve your relationship as well, because you can probably figure out what your partner's love language is just from reading the scenarios.   It was a quick and fun read-lighthearted writing with funny quirks of the opposite sex!  All very true.

0307271862|4.0|The Man from Beijing is something of a novel within a novel.  It starts out as a murder mystery set in Sweden in 2006 and then delves into historical fiction, with vivid tales of China and the United States in 1863, when American railroads were built on the backs of immigrant laborers.  Its style reminded me quite a lot of the works of Stieg Larsson.  Its pace is somewhat sedate at times and, as with Larsson's works, is loaded with political information regarding modern day Sweden.  Some readers might find that this drags, but I like this level of detail as it gives me a glimpse into a country about which I frankly know very little.    The book centers around a mass murder that occurs in a small, fictional Swedish hamlet and then spirals out from there, the story picking up multiple threads at once.  It is told from the perspective of multiple characters, some of them Swedish and some of them Chinese, but the most central character is that of Birgitta Roslin, a respected judge who discovers that she is connected to some of the murder victims.  I like Birgitta as a character.  She's a woman who's reached a certain point of her life, has had some marital troubles, and is reflective about her past and her future.  I found her narrative interesting and her frustrations by the setbacks of the murder investigation were my own.    I think what the novel does best is to draw some comparisons between industrialized nations and those that haven't yet been developed.  The books uses the historical narratives to show how countries like the United States reached the level of industry and technology they did, and how those nations on the brink of industrialization may be on the same path.  I thought the author did a very good job of poking holes in some of the notions those of us in industrialized nations hold dear, and this book does a nice job of showing how the attitudes of Western nations tend to be rather hypocritical when it comes to developing nations like China.  I foundthis to be extremely good food for thought.    Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the book for me, though, was the connection to China.  I found the Chinese characters in the book to be very interesting, and I thought Mankell did an excellent job of illustrating some of the tensions that exist in modern China.  I also thought the theme of hypocrisy really hit home in this section, as the actions of some of the characters are motivated by the same greed and cruelty that haunt the characters' current existence.
4789004546|5.0|This book is a great reference for Japanese grammar.  You can use it when you're reading a Japanese text to look up grammatical patterns you're not familiar with, and you can also read it straight through to learn a lot of Japanese grammar.  I think it would also be a good supplement to a textbook that isn't really organized  around grammatical features, and may not have a good index to look up grammar points.<br /><br />Each entry includes a brief description of the grammatical feature being described, plus example sentences, formation rules, and more detailed notes.  The notes often include comparisons to other related expressions, highlighting the similarities and distinctions between them.  In addition to the main entries, the book also has some useful introductory material on Japanese grammar at the beginning, and several useful appendixes at the end.<br /><br />I think this is a must-have book for students of Japanese.  And as you progress in your studies, you can also move on to its [[ASIN:4789007758 Intermediate]] and [[ASIN:B001GOVW4M Advanced]] companion volumes.

B002ZG9788|2.0|I really enjoyed the original 1981 version when I was a kid and I still enjoy it now. I still pop the DVD in the player for a watch from time to time. The FX are dated and cheesy and some of the performances are a little over the top, but the original version had such a charm and quailty that makes it somewhat of a classic for Hollywood's golden age of summer blockbusters.    Now for the newest \\"remake\\".    Well, first off, let's start with the star, Sam Worthington (Terminator:Salvation and Avatar). Sam is a stoic, passionless and expressionless actor. Think William Shatner on downers. His Marine Corps high-and-tight hairdo ruins all credibility and believability of the character of Perseus and his performance is exactly the same as his performances in his previous films. They didn't even TRY to make him look Greek or, at the very least, European.    Liam Neeson, usually a fine actor, struts about as the immortal Zues spouting out ham-fisted dialogue and chewing up the scenery. He looks like he is still dressed in his costume from \\"Excalibur\\". What a waste of a fine actor.    The whole film seems to be focused on action rather than plot or character developement. Some characters simply show up and really have nothing whatsoever to do rather than take up screen time. Also, this version completely ignores the actual mythology that it derives from (so did the original, only not quite as much as the 2010 version).    The FX were decent enough, but as it goes all to often in Hollywood lately, they aren't enough to salvage a weak script, bad acting and bad casting. The FX are the only reason that this film rates two stars in my book.     My summary opinion, rent (or buy) the original and enjoy a much more satisfying movie-going experience.
B000093BDX|5.0|If you remember that brief period between the 1950's greasy hair music and the Beatles, there was a brief window where the Beach Boys, the Everly Brothers, and other American acts prevailed.  After the 1964 Brit invasion, most of the groups that depended upon harmony melted away in the tidal wave of rock, but the Beach Boys soldiered on, actually getting better.    All the great songs are in this collection; see the attached list for your favorites.    Sometimes we forget that our favorite songs were not about great moments in history, or questions for the cosmos, but rather, is my car faster than yours, will that woman deign to go out with me, will I grow up finally and be a man?  Yet, the songs here and throughout rock deal with the smaller issues, which, when you think about it, ARE more important to our actual lives than any pondering of the universe.

A few people wondered if it was Twilightish and I have to say that I didn't think it was anywhere close to being similar to Twilight. In fact, I enjoyed the two main characters much more than Bella and Edward.  I loved Grace and thought her connection to the wolves in the woods behind her house rang true. Sam touched my heart and I could so sympathize with his struggle between the wolf and human worlds. As I was reading this book I was leaning towards a 4/5 star rating, but the ending was fantabulous and I ended up giving this one a 5!!! Read it!

B000FWHVKA|4.0|Silent Shout is the third album of Swedish electronic duo The Knife, composed of brothers Olof Dreijer and Karin Dreijer Andersson. The album takes on a very sinister feel, between Andersson's distorted vocals that often sound like something taken straight out of The Exorcist and the continual resonant high pitches that run throughout the album that are occasionally goosebump inducing. The Knife manages to walk the fine line between dissonance and harmony, with sounds that are occasionally so off-pitch that they are almost painful to hear. Indeed, the use of harsh sounds makes the Knife unlikely to ever break into the mainstream, despite being tightly wound into pulsing beats.       True to their namesake, the most outstanding aspect of the album is the knife-like concision of the beats created with percussions and synthesizers. The percussions run choppily album in pulsing, concise beats, which are often used to great effect. For example, the title track \\"Silent Shout\\" begins and ends with a prominent drum beat that is reminiscent of a heartbeat before the shrill synthesizer beats come in, which adds to the creepy, dark aspect of the album. The variance in the percussion is also impressive, such as the range from a bizarre rattling sound in \\"Marble House\\" to an almost tropical Caribbean drum beat in the same song. The synthesizer is also often used to create a textured layer to the beats, coming in sharp pulses of high-pitched sound the oddly complement the more full-bodied sound of the percussions.       At the same time, the synthesizer is also used to heighten the mood of the album with looming melodies. The synthesizer almost seems to moan intermittently through the songs in and out of the sharper beats, such as in the beginning of \\"Forest Families.\\" The vocals lend a similar effect to the songs. The heavy distortion of the female vocals can make them sound shrill and drawn out over the course of the same song. On \\"Silent Shout\\" the vocals almost sound like they are layered on top of one another to create an almost demonic effect, and in many other tracks the female voice is significantly pitch shifted. Although the vocals lend themselves particularly well to the haunting mood of the entire album, they tend to lean towards cacophony rather than harmony and are somewhat difficult to listen to. The female vocalist always sounds noticeably strained, almost to the point where the overall effect could be described as \\"constipated.\\" Although the distorted vocals blend in seamlessly with the beat of the album, they sometimes seem to detract from the overall song, such as on \\"Still Light,\\" which features the downshifted Exorcist sounds combined with screeching vocals.       Given the occasional abrasive qualities of the sounds used, perhaps the minimalist use of sound is what particularly suits the Knife. The album is peppered with masterful uses of silence that becomes part of the music. In fact, it makes some of the sounds used that much more shocking to the ear, and infuses the beats with much more life, making their sharp punches more pronounced.       While Silent Shout definitely carries a certain appeal with its seamless beats and commitment to the thematic creepiness, it is definitely not an album for everyone. However, after getting beyond the initial inaccessibility of the album one finds a deeply and darkly emotional album with rich musical textures woven throughout.
B00288KNJU|5.0|I guess their holding out until they award it with Animated Movie of the decade. In my humble opinion, this movie was shafted at the Oscars because it wasn't from Disney or Pixar and CORALINE, is a threat to the animated movie market that has been monopolized by Disney/Pixar for...ever. Yet, CORALINE stands by itself as the kind of movie that will change the landscape of animation in the years to come. It doesn't need the publicity to pull this off. It does it with its quality and its magic.<br /><br />Quiet simply, CORALINE is amazing. It may be slightly strange, and it may be slightly dark, but so was MONSTER HOUSE. It is a ghost/witch story for children. It may be slightly scary, but that is part of the fun of it.<br /><br />I first watched it with a group of adult friends, in 3D (FOCUS was nice enough to release the 3D version, regular blu-ray & dvd blu-ray with special features with their first release, not the special secret overpriced edition 6 months later like some companies), and found it mind-blowing.  It was the first time that I had seen a 3D movie, at home, actually work.<br /><br />So, my first inclination was that it was too scary for my 4-year old and probably too scary for my 9-year old. Yet, not soon after, the 9-year old asked for it and there they were, both of them, glued to the television like I had never seen. Most movies hold their attention for a while and they end up drawing or wrestling, yet CORALINE had them staring at the television the whole time, jaws open, floored.  Thirty minutes after it was over, they wanted to watch it again... and again... there they were, awe struck through the entire movie, just like I was.<br /><br />Coraline tells the story of a little girl who is feeling gilted by her parents who are too busy with their lives to pay her attention. So, when she finds a secret door that leads her to an alternate universe, with attentive, loving parents who give her floats for dinner, she is enticed to say goodbye to the real world and join her alternative universe where everyone has buttons for eyes.<br /><br />It's a classic that should be held in the same esteem and long-lasting category as Wizard of Oz and it will, at least in my home, be one of the most loved children movies of all time.universe where everyone has buttons for eyes.

B00319ECC4|4.0|I am so glad that Burton and Dino got back together to make a REAL Fear Factory album!  This is a very brutal album, with the precision guitar riffs that one would expect from Dino.  I love Divine Heresy (slthough Bringer of Plagues didn't grab me as much as the debut), but FF has always been on the top of the food chain in my opinion, except for Transgression (which had a couple decent tracks but was by far their weakest effort).      However, Mechanize is as heavy an album as you are gonna come across.  Standout tracks include \\"Industrial Discipline\\", \\"Fear Campaign\\" and \\"controlled Demolition\\".  Even \\"Designing the Enemy\\", a ballad compared to the other tracks, fits nicely in this album.      The reason I only gave this album four stars is the drumming.  Blast beats may work for Gene Hoglan in SYL, but The Fear Factory that I loved so much in the 90's had the perfectly-timed rhythmic bass drum beats that went well with Dino's riffs.    But overall, I feel like Fear Factory have returned to form quite nicely.

The only surprising aspect of this truly third rate piece of work is that there seems to be even more coincidence in the 'real' underground world of society's poor and pulverized than in a conventional drug store mystery.  The only con here is the book itself.
B0009UC810|5.0|we have been watching this film for years in VHS. Great improvement in DVD. great price
B000MV90B2|4.0|The movie is what it is. It's not a masterpiece but the battle scenes are magnificent and always fun to watch. No CGI here.    The DVD on the other hand is awful. The subtitles are automatically on and in Chinese. The English subtitles are always off and sometimes just wrong. Also the menu is very basic. At least it's cheap.
B000002KIT|3.0|The recording quality is quite good for an older live concert, but each song is chopped together. Rather cheaply done.
B002YIHO7I|1.0|I love the Greatest Hits by Sade,listen to it often.   But she's run out of material now. This latest album is a lame effort to market on her past success. I tossed my CD into the Salvation Army bin near my house along with some books I was done reading and some old clothes.
B002JODV3S|5.0|The Blu-Ray looks good and most importantly it sounds really good also. The 5.1 mix is very well produced...
B0033AGPG2|5.0|This review is of the 2010 vinyl release of First Rays of the New Rising Sun.    If you're weighing whether to buy this, be assured: this is a phenomenal-sounding release. I've got original vinyl copies of all the albums these tunes were originally released on (Cry of Love, Rainbow Bridge, and War Heroes), and this new remaster, on nice heavy vinyl, was like hearing some of the tunes for the first time. The title track (one of my favorites and perhaps Jimi's greatest lesser-known song) in particular really stood out as a revelation -- just an incredibly rich, deep, \\"live\\" drum sound on this and other tracks. Jimi's guitar sounds great too but the remaster here really brings out the separate sounds of all the players to good effect. The sticker on the cover says this is an all-analog remaster, and whatever you think about Experience Hendrix and their profit motives, you've got to commend them for doing the work to reassemble this LP from the assorted analog tapes -- must have been a much tougher process than the remasters of the \\"canon\\" albums released in Jimi's lifetime.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I purchased this for my husband...he is a big fan.  We loved watching the episodes again.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|A wonderfully crafted, thoroughly enjoyable show.  I wish that this had the potential for a long running series on PBS, I truly feel it is one of the best shows, by far, that is on regular (not cable or satellite) TV today. I am so sick of reality TV, and crappy sitcoms with words and behaviors I don't want to hear and see let alone my family view them.  This show is elegant and rough, accurate and charming.  I'm very glad I purchased this season, and I know I will get the others when I can.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|i love the mix of videos such a great price for 47 videos.! ultimate getting your drank on music/video/dance  party!
B0000C6K09|4.0|The CD case was a little damaged, but I think that was due to the shipping process. And one disc had a tiny scratch, but everything worked.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|I'm a 49 year old 'fossil', and a longtime Scorps fan since the Uli Jon Roth days of the 70's.  I've loved every incarnation of this great, influential band, and their 'albums' have almost always been consistently excellent.  They are masters of the hard rock power ballad, and masters of straightforward, tightly written, quality hard rock/metal.  They singlehandedly pioneered and popularized the hard rock genre, along with period bands like The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Black Sabbath, Rush, Led Zeppelin, Mountain, Aerosmith, Status Quo, Thin Lizzy, KISS, etc.  'Sting In The Tail' is yet another fantastic release full of teeth clenching, straightforward rockers, with a power ballad or two.  It is truly amazing and gratifying to hear the great Klaus Meine powerfully belting out songs like as if he's still 25 years old!  Matthias Jabs' guitar work/tone is fantastic as well, and the rest of the band is killer.  The Scorpions continue to show how it's supposed to be done!  'DANKE' Scorpions!
1416575464|5.0|For those of use who look forward to receiving home decorating magazines in the mail each month, and reading Thursday's Home and Garden section in the New York Times each week, Domino: The Book of Decorating is a special treat. There are thousands of photos, illustrations and hints inside, all culled from the magazine's pages and true to its fresh, eclectic sensibility. It's the kind of book that you can't get enough of, that you pull off the shelf and pore over again and again.<br /><br />The book is organized into chapters that guide the reader through house design room-by-room, from dining room and living room to office and kid's room. But it's most useful as a compendium of smaller design solutions, as a pattern book full of examples for someone putting together an interior. There's information on every page that answers simple questions. Does a room painted charcoal grey feel dark? Do they make two-burner cooktops? Is it garish to use more than one patterned rug in the same room? And there's information on every page that opens new possibilities. Can one wallpaper a ceiling? Can one install 1' hexagonal ceramic tile on a bathroom wall? Can one hang unframed photographs on a wall? The answer to all these and many other questions, happily, is yes.<br /><br />Domino's decorating guide, not much larger than a hardcover novel, is packed with sharp design ideas. If someone is just getting serious about decorating or remodeling her home, and searching for a single source of information and inspiration, this volume might be the perfect kick-off point for her adventure.
0439023483|5.0|This is supposedly a YA book, but I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending it to any student pre-high school. Having said that, this book was a FANTASTIC read!!! I flew through the book, and had trouble putting it down. The novel takes place in a post-apocalyptic future America, called \\"Pantem\\", with a Capital (located somewhere in present-day Colorado) and 12 surrounding districts. A 13th district was destroyed during the rebellion, and as a reminder of the Capital's superiority, each year The Hunger Games are held. In the vein of Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, a boy and girl are picked from each district and sent to an arena in the Capital. The arena is created specially each year, containing a different landscape and the 24 \\"tributes\\" are required to fight to the death. The book combines the suspense of The Lottery with the action of Running Man (starring Governor Ah-nold). Collins was good to hold off on too much of the teenage angst, despite dealing with a female teenage main character in the first person. But she provided an excellent meta-story, fully threshing out the rules of The Hunger Games utilizing memories of past games (which all citizens are forced to watch). Not so much a \\"Make You Think About The World\\" book, but just a great, quick read!
B001DDBCUU|2.0|At the time this film came out, I was working for the NY Academy of Sciences on 63rd and 5th Avenue. The organization is housed in an elegant old townhouse that filmmakers often use for exterior shots. Well, imagine my amusement when Carrie and Mr. Big are given a tour of the \\"most beautiful NY apartment.\\" I had to laugh - the entrance and the big white room with the French windows is where I've crossed thousands of times (along with other $40K a year office drones!) on my way to a meeting. That room is on the first floor, but they made it look like the penthouse! Bogus. So unlike most of the viewers, I couldn't lose myself in the fantasy! And that's what irks me about this film, none of it can be taken seriously, unlike the TV show. Everybody is dressed to the nines and the whole film feels like a long infocommerical for Bag Borrow or Steal, bridal designers, and Diane Von Furstenberg. From the first shot of Carrie wearing an obscenely ugly big flower dress to the flashy, oversized dresses and to perhaps the ugliest wedding dress I've ever seen - the Vivienne Westwood gown that is all about excess, not style - nothing is life-sized. Ironically Mr. Big wanted to be Mr. Modest - and got pummeled for it! Considering the excess on display around him, it came as no suprise that anybody who dared bring down an overdressed, spoiled NYC princess to earth should get hit. The same with the cheating husband of Miranda - he punctured her balloon of self-righteousness. I felt sorry for Jennifer Hudson - it was such an apparent attempt to \\"multiculturalize\\" the series by bringing in a black character, but she played a role that was no different than from that of a maid in the bad old days of Hollywood. Instead of making her an equal (a rich black woman), they made her a sappy Girl Friday who is as shallow and hungry for fashion and excess as her boss. When Carrie gave her the Louis Vutton bag I had to squirm. The moral is clear - anybody who loves material things is good; all other people are idiots. The only attempt to challenge this is at the end, when Carrie gives in to Mr. Big's wishes, but by that time, all the fashion show fantasy has been exhausted, and their wedding feels like a post-party afterthought. A hypocritical ending that tries to say \\"money and fashion isn't everything\\" that is so half-hearted. Yuck!her people are idiots.

B00328G4V6|5.0|Anything unreleased by Jimi Hendrix that hits the marketplace (as long as it's an official release) is 5 stars, by default. There has never been an artist/guitarist that expanded the possibilities of blues/rock and how to play the guitar as much as Jimi Hendrix--not even close...especially in this day and age where any talent at all is a rare find. So 5 stars, right off the bat--period!    Now, thinking in the context of Jimi's music (rather than today's garbage), this album is good...nothing that drops jaws like his original albums did in the late 60's, but good enough for any moderate-to-diehard Hendrix fan adding this CD to their Hendrix catalog. The title track is OK, not great (not suprisingly...otherwise it probably would have been released sooner). The other material is mainly alternate takes/arrangements of previously recorded songs, and they make up the best part of the CD. I personally enjoyed the very different version of Bleedin' Heart, especially. It's always cool to hear Hendrix do another take on his tried and true masterpiece songs! And the sound quality is excellent--great re-mastering job! Sounds completely new and fresh.    So not as indispensable as his first three albums, but still good enough to complete your Hendrix collection!
B0001EFTVA|4.0|I don't know why - it's probably the title - but I've always had the impression that Tokyo Godfathers was an animated Japanese gangster film. I should have known better than expect something so prosaic and predictable from a director like Satoshi Kon (Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress). There are yakuza gangsters involved here, but only as one of the background elements that the director makes use of in this entertaining Christmas tale journey through the backstreets of Tokyo, when three down-and-outs find an abandoned baby in an alley on Christmas Eve and set off in search of its mother.     Even that old story, played out and parodied in many comedy movies, is given a rather different spin by Satoshi Kon - one of the very best directors working in Japanese animated features - starting off with the main characters. \\"A bum, a homo, a runaway and a foundling\\" is how homeless alcoholic Gin describes their odd little family unit, and there's a lot of fun to be found in such a gathering, as well as a little bit of self-reflection and sentimentality. And sure why not? It's a Christmas setting and inevitably, confronted with a baby left out on the streets, it's going to remind them of their own families and going to think about their own position, the chances they have lost and the lives that none of them will ever have again.     What's wonderful about Tokyo Godfathers however - and why it's an animated film rather than a regular live-action comedy-drama - is the fine detail that can be added to the characterisation and the exaggeration that can be indulged without it seeming unnaturalistic and out of place. Here, movements can be paced and coordinated, expressions perfectly thought through for what they reveal about the characters, and they are animated as ever with supreme precision. Satoshi Kon does perhaps manoeuvre events a little too smoothly and schematically here in this particular film, but it flows wonderfully and is full of wit and entertainment.
0810979772|5.0|This extention of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is absolutely BRILLIANT and I want to personally thank Jeff Kinney and if it wasn't his own idea, whoever in his life or at the publishing house came up with the concept of a journal tie in with the series.<br /><br />One of the reasons the the Wimpy Kid series is so popular, besides the first person kid narration and boy appeal stories, is the mix of visuals (cartoons/doodles) that make the book easy and appealing to a young reader.  It also provides visual imagery that kids who may have low reading comprehension have difficulty processing on their own.  I also like that it's a series of vignettes that tie into an overarching plot.  This is also more palatable to a young reader.  Now take that concept and turn it into a way for a young child to dabble in journaling and self expression and you've got a marvelous tool for teaching and life experience.<br /><br />My oldest son (turning 9) has autism.  He loves the Wimpy Kid series and I'm guessing it's because of the reasons described above.  The Do-It-Yourself version has sparked his interest in self expression and given him tools to help develop his skills in written expression.  The check lists, fill in the blanks, fill in the bubble comics make it fun and provide a structure in an area that is difficult for him.  The blank journal at the back gives him space to dabble in writing whatever he feels.  It's personalized and fun AND a great educational experience.  I highly recommend this series and if your child takes to the series, get them this Do-It-Yourself kit.
