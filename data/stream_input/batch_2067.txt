B00AJLHUYO|3.0|Horror is the kind of genre where a break through film is seldom released and even rarely recognized as one.  While I liked Paranormal Activity and it opened to me a sea of horror possibilties, others thought it was the weakest film they have seen. There are and will always be this league of extraordinary gentlemen who never get scared and thank God I am not one of them. Anyway, Sinister is a respectable horror film. It's made well, builds on an average plot and has some very good acting by Ethan Hawke, without whom I don't know how long my attention span would hold out to the film. I wish the wife was a better actor and more involved in the plot, at times it feels like the protagonist was left alone.<br /><br />The film's biggest strength is Ethan Hawke and it's biggest failure is the cheap make up. Also what's up with that POSTER. It is so misleading. They should have just had a house or something. I urge you to watch this film if you were a fan of films like Orphan and creaky-haunted-house-torchlight-shadow films.<br /><br />However, the last great horror film I saw was an Australian horror film by the name LAKE MUNGO. It shook the very foundation of my nerves.

1781000530|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo34HJMUFZSDQTN]]<br />AN ANALYTICAL LOOK AT FUTURE TRENDS AND POSSIBILITIES<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The book brings together the work of 16 learned contributors, all experts in the various manifestations of intellectual property law worldwide.  As there are any number of countries where intellectual property law is more or less at a nascent stage, the publication of this book by Edward Elgar is timely.<br /><br />The editor, Ryo Shinamami explains that he intends to analyse different perspectives on the patent system (which we assume is the patent system worldwide), which he regards as being at a turning point as it continues to evolve in various forms in various jurisdictions, including Japan, the US, Europe, India, Brazil and China.  Practitioners, economists and academics generally, who are interested particularly in the latter three economies will find this book useful.<br /><br />It was the Institute of Intellectual Property in Japan which originally decided to publish this thought provoking work of research to commemorate its 20th anniversary in 2009, its foundation being inspired by the youthful ambition of Shimanami to create an organisation in Japan similar to the Max Planck Institute in Munich where he had once studied.<br /><br />As the dream has been realized, it is startling to read Shimanami's comments that there seems to have been what he terms `a loss of momentum in Japan's initiative to become an intellectual property power'. Surprising this, when you consider Japan's technological pre-eminence and its dependence on trade!<br /><br />However, notwithstanding the fundamental problems inherent in the patent system internationally, he concedes that it has nonetheless established its global presence.<br /><br />In line with the book's overall aims, the learned essays therein -- some very technical -- are presented under three main headings.  Part I deals with the essence of -- and the functions of  -- the patent system from both jurisprudential and economic perspectives,  Part II looks to the future of the patent systems in, for example, Europe, the U.S. and Japan.  In Part III the focus is on the future perspectives and challenges that will impact on the respective patent systems of India, China and Brazil.<br /><br />In a rapidly changing world where business has gone global and where commercial boundaries are becoming increasingly blurred, the eventual evolution of a worldwide patent system seems like a practical possibility that will nonetheless take a long time to evolve.<br /><br />In the meantime, this book, with its copious footnoting and detailed index, provides an excellent research tool for anyone professionally involved in the implementation and designing of patents and specifically of patent systems.the essence of -- and the functions of  -- the patent system from both jurisprudential and economic perspectives,  Part II looks to the future of the patent systems in, for example, Europe, the U.S. and Japan.

B0084IG7KC|1.0|This movie was praised as one of the next great movie trilogies for a time to come. So I was curious and expected it to be pretty good. But I must have missed something- there must be something there that I simply could not see. I just could not swallow the premise; it just wasn't believable at all. Frankly it was absurd. But I tried to ignore that and figured that it would be a cool movie anyway, because after all there's tons of movies with absurd plots, but they usually make up for it. But it was really boring! I could not believe how uninteresting it was. I know a lot of people were shocked with the supposed violence, but honestly I didn't noticed any at all- it may have helped if it actually WERE a little violent, but alas. Well maybe compared to a Tinker Bell movie, it can be considered a little violent. It was just one of those movies you cannot stand the sight of after a while. And it would NOT end- it just kept droning on and on. And all the while I kept telling myself, \\"It will be okay, something interesting, some morsel of excitement will be given any moment now, maybe there will even be some kind of climax.\\" And then it was over.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|If you are a fan of this sort of programming, you could not possibly do better. The story moves swiftly and never lags. The characters are involving and begin to feel like family. And, above all, the acting is outstanding. It is exceptional that among a cast this large and varied, every actor plays their part to perfection and without a false note.<br /><br />It is also worth mentioning that the seller (Morgan Rivver) has exceptional customer service. The first shipment contained a damaged DVD (NOT the fault of the seller). Morgan Rivver replaced the set extremely rapidly. The 5 stars above applies to them also.

B005P5TQPU|5.0|I loved this season. So many great episodes with sooooo much going on. Castiel as God and Death as the hero. Bobby's death and Dean's daughter. The mental break of Sam and then Castiel at Lucifer's hand. The return of Jo. Time travel and vengeful gods. Dick and his monster playmates. A fallen angel and the leader of fallen men. A tablet reading prophet and a demon nurse. Sammy all alone while Dean and Castiel are transported to Purgatory. This is a can't miss season full of drama, laughs, action, mystery, sorrow, pain, tears, betrayal, hope, faith, brotherhood, family and friendship. Oh and I can't forget to mention the two really actractive boys doing what they must to save the world.
0486236951|5.0|The only difficulty this book would present would be transferring the patterns given by Carter Houck from one page of paper to tracing paper.  I would have loved to see perforations along the spine of the book to ease the tearing out of the patterns I would trace.  And I would have appreciated mention of such transferring materials as the widely available transfer pencils.  Apart from those considerations, the patterns were lovely, and I can hardly wait to get to work on them.

B004R96TN2|3.0|First, the artwork is both lovely and comfortingly familiar.  The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth are indelible parts of my childhood and I found that it was very easy to find familiar faces and patterns among the characters.  I also felt the deck was easy to intuitively grasp, such as the Queen of Bedlam (I know those feels, yo ) and the Prince of Shadows.  While the art itself was not so richly, thoroughly symbolic that a meaning could be grasped at a glance, the explanations made sense and were applicable to the nuts and bolts of every day life, not just to higher concepts.<br /><br />Some notes on format: The cards are a little big for me, but I have tiny hands, so this probably isn't an issue for most other people.  They've broken in well with some dedicated shuffling.  They are numbered for easy ordering and the print is large and easy to read.  The book itself, though, has light print on off-white paper which could cause problems for people with visual impairments.  I felt like I had to tilt it to catch the light properly to read it best.  It's very neatly designed, not cluttered at all, with extra art and bits of poetry and a great surprise: a large section at the back for notes!  I was especially pleased with that because I mark up all my books, but it didn't stop me from putting notes in the margins.  ;)<br /><br />The deck I received has so far been very neutral.  It has no scent, doesn't seem to carry any particular energy, nor does it demonstrate much of a personality even when I query it.  I'm a little disappointed but I'm willing to believe the fault may lie in my lack of experience, though others who bought it around the same time have expressed the same things.<br /><br />Moving on to the content of the book itself: I felt there was a heavy reliance on Jungian archetypes, which I suppose is to be expected.  The appearance of these archetypes makes the deck seem familiar and easily grasped but in some ways it also felt to me like the makers were ticking boxes off a list.  Like, \\"We need to have this, this, this, and this.\\"  I couldn't find any information on the Frouds' religious affiliation and maybe I'm just hypersensitive to NeoWicca infiltration because I've been Pagan so long, but I felt like the deck's emphasis on duality, mirroring, 'balance', and the specific appearance of the maiden, the crone, and a whole list of queens strongly recalls popular opinion in the Pagan community.  Which is to say, it seems like Brian's vision of Faerie is strongly ruled by very human standards of gender roles and sexuality, which always makes me side-eye a bit.<br /><br />Speaking of gender and sexuality, this book and this deck are relentlessly ciscentric and heteronormative.  I'm going to quote from page 23, the page that introduces the Queen's Consorts.<br /><br />\\"The Queen's consorts are the balancing male energies that complement the queens.  There are nine consorts, each of whom is a different aspect of male/female relationships - and by this I mean male/female energy, not necessarily gender.\\"<br /><br />This is sort of a disingenuous assertion, the idea that you can say 'male/female' without actually invoking gender and expect that to make logical sense.  There is no 'get out of cissexism/gender binary enforcement/heterosexism free' card just because you say so.  In the actual section on archetypes, the introduction of The Lord and the Lady (more NeoWicca spillover or actual Wicca?  IDK) says this:<br /><br />\\"The Lord and Lady are the divine couple, the masculine and feminine energy in everything, and it is the union of the two that makes the whole... any relationship depends upon the dynamic between these two forces of nature.  If we can learn to acknowledge, identify, and understand these overriding energies in our relationships with ourselves and with others, we will be on the path to understanding what drives the heart of any and all relationships.\\"<br /><br />As you can see this language continues the thread of enforcing heteronormativity and ciscentrism.  To say 'the interplay of these forces drives the heart of any and all relationships' erases relationships between binary-nonconforming individuals.  I would buy that if they were talking about Active/passive principles, but they're talking about the Archetypal Masculine and the Archetypal Feminine and with me that just doesn't fly.<br /><br />The entry for the Lady of the Forest also read a lot to me like \\"FEEEEEELIIIIIIIIIINGS\\" and maybe I've been running in feminist circles too long, but when someone equates the Feminine Principle with all things emotional, all I hear is \\"we're going to take the idea that women are over-emotional and hysterical, make it sound like a good thing, and stick it on a pedestal!\\"  There's a fetishistic sort of quality to it that, from my perspective, runs through the entire book and makes me a little bit uncomfortable.  It's exactly the same quality I find is very prevalent in the Pagan community at large.<br /><br />POC have nearly a nil presence in this deck.  I went through and counted, discarding faeries with inhuman skin colors, and found 8 out of the 65, most of whom who COULD be POC but could just as easily have been white with dark hair.  The only faeries who seemed distinctly POC had Asian features.  If there was supposed to be any LGBT representation I didn't find it, and while Faerie is definitely NOT my runaround, I was under the impression that many fae are genderless and they don't have most of our cultural hang-ups?  Anyway, for a race of shapeshifters and illusionists, such a heavy focus on heterosexuality and not a single mention of trans* seemed a little odd to me.  Also, the 'light' and 'innocence' and 'maidenly' faeries are heavily imbalanced toward gleaming, pearl-white and in some cases blue-white, so there's that racial trope.<br /><br />In terms of the characters, I felt that the deck's heavy reliance and emphasis on balance principles actually did not serve it.  Many of the characters felt superfluous or repeated.  I was very tempted to go through and remove them to streamline the deck... for instance there's the Jungian Archetypal \\"The Boy\\" who is essentially Peter Pan, and then later in the deck... \\"The Pan\\".  Also, some of the characters seemed to have been included just to keep a balance between male and female in certain suites which again led to some of them being extraneous.  I kept coming to characters and feeling like I'd read their descriptions before, and some of them seemed to have less... self-hood to them, like they weren't fully developed, possibly because most of their purview had already been spread around the rest of the characters.  I had a harder time getting a feel for them because they seemed more like accessories to their suite-partner than characters in their own right.<br /><br />I was pleased to see that the Frouds, throughout the book, do warn that Faerie can be dangerous and make it clear that not all fae are good.  However, there's still an element of 'sweetness and light and ultimate wisdom' going that seems like wishful thinking to me considering what I've heard from those of you who actually travel Faerie.  The Elven Knight, for instance, harkens back to the Wild Hunt, and I wrote in the margins, \\"should we be messing with this?\\" and a few reminders that \\"processionals between the Faerie and the Mortal World\\" usually involved kidnappings and forced transformations for mortals unlucky enough to witness them.  In the entry for The Heartless Love I've highlighted, \\"People often wish for a faerie lover but that isn't always a wise wish.\\"  My notes say, 'Ya think?'<br /><br />As for other things I was pleased with, The Hero reminded me strongly of Sailor Moon and I was happy to see the Lame Smith archetype in play.  The Magician is already one of my favorite cards, but it confuses the hell out of me - the character is described as female, but that is SO clearly Jareth I'm not sure what the Frouds were thinking.<br /><br />All in all I'm enjoying the deck, so don't let my nitpicking critique imply that I'm not glad that I bought it.  Most of the problematic aspects of it are the same ones writ large through the community so I expect them when I open a book like this, though that does not mean I'll stop calling it out when I see it.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This was one of those books that draws you in, makes you feel as though you really know the characters, as speaks in<br />such a true voice for each one.  The zinger, half way through, wasn't entirely without warning, but the ending sure was.  I<br />just really enjoyed this story.
B00755MHXG|3.0|This books is about Auggie, a homeschooled boy who was born with facial anomalies and is attending the 5th grade at school for the first time.<br /><br />Through Auggie's voice, and the voice of his friends and family, the book explores the feelings of little kids and teenagers towards change (going to a new school, making new friends and enemies, losing old friends...) and towards what is different (in this case, obviously, Auggie's face). By doing this, we are enabled to learn how Auggie's acquaintances' lives, relationships and social environments are touched by involving Auggie, from their own point of view.<br /><br />This works for Auggie (who obviously tells most of the story) and for her sister Olivia (for being so close to her brother), but it gets a little weak when Auggie's or Olivia's friends tell the story, and even worse when Olivia's boyfriend does. They just seem far from everything that's going on to make a significant contribution that we haven't heard from someone else; but they do help to understand Auggie and Olivia a bit further (the two characters that we really get to know deeply, and making Olivia the most \\"real\\" character).<br /><br />I would like to have read about Auggie's parents points of view: I understand that this book is about the kid's life, but at the beginning of the book his family was his WHOLE life: the parents that had to make decisions for Auggie and themselves, decisions that seemed to put Olivia \\"in second place\\" and could be painful for everyone in the short term, the mother who homeschooled him... The parents that have to be Wonder Woman and Superman for their child. And they are... ALL THE TIME. We get hints of their struggle via Olivia or Auggie, but that's it. I think excluding the parents' point of view takes away the opportunity to let children know that even adults have a hard time in a situation like this, and also takes away the \\"credit\\" that supermom and superdad deserve by making everything look so easy.<br /><br />The other point of view I missed was Julian's, the guy bullying Auggie: In most stories we learn about the \\"bad guy\\": who are they? why are they bad? what is it they are going after? I refuse to believe that a kid is mean just because he is evil incarnate. I think, in most cases bullying is a child's cry for help to say he's afraid/bored/sad/lonely/spoiled. And I think they deserve to be heard, for bullying could be as sad as being bullied.<br /><br />It is a nice story, you know where it's going and how it's going to end, but it is nicely told, funny and easy to read. I would just have enjoyed it more if things weren't all solved so smoothly and it didn't feel so one-sided.

0770435726|5.0|My frequent complaints about mysteries is that they are too straight forward; \\"The Expats\\" is not.  What other readers disliked about the book was what I found so interesting--the repeatedly layered movements in time, place, and character. I liked immensely believing that I knew when I'd  soon discovered I didn't. I also was intrigued by Kate, the main character and narrator.  Having just finished \\"Gone Girl\\" with a pair of unreliable narrators, I approached Kate with what turned out to be unnecessary skepticism.  Learning to trust her was part of the delight of reading this mystery.

B00AYB1RGG|5.0|What a fun movie.  Rented this and watched it on a plane.  Definitely not suitable for children, but I would recommend it to anyone who is an action movie fan
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy is really well written. The hype about these books was so missing the point of the story line.
0812993292|4.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is a small tale of an unimportant man going on an unassuming errand.  At least, that's what Harold Fry himself believes when he sets out to mail a letter to a dying friend.  But when Harold follows his own inner urgings and keeps walking, past the mailbox at the end of his drive, past the mailbox a few blocks down, and right through the small English town he has lived in for decades and out into the bigger world, his errand becomes a journey, and his journey becomes a pilgrimage. He wants, in some vague way, to make a difference.<br /><br />Rachel Joyce could just as easily have been named this novel The Unlikely Awakening of Harold Fry.  It's a spiritual parable that tells us how to recover from a grievous wound.  It shows us how to forgive and how to transform our pain into something helpful, something useful, something wise.  As Harold puts one foot in front of the other, each new experience opens him up, and the opening lets out a little more of what he has kept inside.<br /><br />Joyce is a wonderful writer.  The details of the landscape and people Harold encounters on his journey are selected to enhance the metaphor of his awakening.  She offers us very concrete ways to experience his pain and anguish, as well as a way to glimpse the beauty and wonder of his journey.  Joyce is a master at pacing and suspense, revealing just enough of the past to keep us moving forward.  Joyce very delicately withholds the truth of Harold's transgressions until Harold, and the reader, are ready to examine them in a compassionate way.  As Harold transforms his guilt and distress into forgiveness, his wife manages to change as well.  Her transformation is as telling as Harold's, and both are as real as can be.<br /><br />The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry has a deep resonance, largely because we are all on a journey.  It may not be as epic a journey as Harold Fry's, but a journey non-the-less.  If we choose to take up the call of the openroad, to `make a difference', as Harold Fry does, then our internal journey has begun.  Walk a while with Harold, and see the world with the fresh eyes of a newly compassionate person.  It's a journey well worth it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I really had a hard time putting this one down. The love of family is so strong and inspiring. I had to dive right into book 2, Colleen Hoover just had me enraptured.
0525951652|5.0|Fall of Giants was written by Ken Follett, who is an incredible author . It is the type of book that you can't put down. I could hardly wait for the second book to be published to find out what had happened to the characters.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What an action packed trilogy! What a world to live in for those people. It really makes you feel sorry for All the District people and the Capital people speak for themselves...
B008YCMM2A|2.0|I was extremely excited about this release since it was announced. Upon seconds of my first listen I was very disappointed. The performances seem stellar but I cannot get past the poor fidelity and mix. Bootleg indeed. Miles' horn is ultra dry and often distorted and drowns out all the other players, Wayne's sax is almost as bad. When the horns aren't blasting you are left with the amazing rhythm section presented as mainly a wash of cymbals. Dejohnette's remarkable kick drum work is basically inaudible, Chick Corea's electric piano is mixed way too quietly and Dave Holland's bass seems simply absent at most times. It's a shame this 'Lost Quintet' wasn't properly recorded live or in the studio. The music is obviously great but the lack of any sonic cohesion makes this release more of a frustration than a revelation. I think these recordings didn't see the light of day for almost 25 years because they really just sound bad.<br />I would strongly suggest the Bootleg Series Vol 1 with Tony Williams and Herbie Hancock over this edition.<br />This Quintet can be heard with the addition of Keith Jarrett on organ, Airto on percussion and Dave Holland's bass fully electrified on Live At The Fillmore East (March 7, 1970) It's About That Time. This shows the group working heavily off Bitches Brew material yet faster and harder. They are simply on fire.<br />Columbia is really scraping the dusty insides of the vault with Live In Europe 1969: The Bootleg Series Vol 2.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This whole Trilogy was very well written with a great story line. I don't think the hype over the sexual content did the book justice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its like temple run and jetpack joyride in one. But its twice as good as both combined. All my friends and I compete in it.

If you love British Productions this will wow you with plot, acting, set design, costumes,...every aspect of the production!  Watch one episode and you will be addicted to the ups and downs of this wealthy family (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs). Have watched all three seasons, and can't wait for the next!

159315724X|5.0|A must read if you want to know what it takes to succeed. Very honest and though provoking. A proven blueprint for examining your life, where you are right now, how to get to where you want to go, and what landmines you need to avoid along the way.

0547848412|4.0|This story is worth reading many times as you discover many aspects of our day to day lives.

This is one of best way this book taught us.

B007TXN4TK|1.0|I really didnt use it nor did my daughter and at times there was no volume. I give this a one star.
1601252463|5.0|You might as well get this book because it is basically the add on to the Core Rulebook. This book is packed with stuff like new Prestige classes, a wealth of helpful equipment, and hundreds of new awesome spells and magic items. Variant class abilities, rule subsystems, and thematic archetypes for all 11 core classes. Over a hundred awesome new feats, combat abilities for all classes, and six new juicy character classes to explore. It's like a big bowl of ice cream with lots of yummy toppings, and I highly recommend it for Pathfinder fans. Take note of the books fabulous eyecandy artwork throughout as well. High quality product for gamers that want a detailed, advanced, and high quality game with more options. Surely a must have book for the serious Pathfinder gamer.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Definitely a book that will keep you turning the pages and leave you wanting more! Can't wait for another one!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. You can never be good enough but always think you could do better. What's nice is it's never exactly the same twice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is really good and entertaining, it's really worth downloading and it gives you daily missions so you don't get bored. So overall it's brilliant.

B0063IH60K|5.0|My husband doesn't like the lights on when he's trying to sleep, but he doesn't mind my Kindle Fire at all.
0618918248|4.0|I wonder if this is the most-reviewed book on Amazon...<br /><br />Before I decided to review, I had a look at the one-star ratings to examine their arguments. Unsurprisingly, these consist mostly of ad hominem attacks on Dawkins (I guess a visceral hatred of the writer by some readers is to be expected with a book like this) and the same old silly empirical \\"proofs\\" of God's existence, arguments that some believers always fall back on. I could see no valid refutations of Dawkins's critical points.<br /><br />Despite the fact that all arguments for God's existence are easily refuted, these \\"proofs\\" keep reappearing. If you believe, people, just believe. You don't need proof to believe. Looking for proof is only a manifestation of your insecurity.<br /><br />As for the book itself, I can only give four stars. Prof. Dawkins is a much better writer than he shows here. The arguments are a bit repetitive and long-winded. His attacks are intentional - something his opponents don't grasp. Prof. Dawkins does not seem interested in appeasing believers. Religious belief is almost always two-faced. One of the faces might be messages of love, or tolerance, or looking after the poor or sick. But these CANNOT be divorced from the other face, that of bigotry, persecution of non-believers/heretics, inquisition, jihad, etc. My issue with his attacks isn't that they are present, but that they drag on and sometimes seem like just rants.<br /><br />For those who have a knee-jerk hate of Dawkins and this book, try Daniel Dennett's Breaking the Spell. Same theme, but perhaps more even-tempered. But have a look at the one star reviews of Dennett: they look like the same people, just as anxious be be offended as they were by Dawkins.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I play this on my Kindle Fire when I can't sleep. My husband hates lights on when he's trying to sleep.
B002ZG9940|5.0|George Clooney is one of our best American actors. I like to see him taking risks by working with a European director (Anton Corbijn), who is from the Netherlands. I watch films by European directors like Michael Haneke, an Austrian director who has made a number of films that are unlike any that are made in the U.S. Haneke won two Academy Award nominations in 2009 for his German language film The White Ribbon. This year his French language film Amour has been nominated for best foreign language film.<br />American audiences seem to prefer films that have happy endings. That is not a requirement for European audiences.<br />I don't know much about Corbijn, but I noted that his 2008 DVD Control received a rating of 4 1/2 stars on Amazon, so I ordered it and a DVD of the Director's Series for Corbijn to find out what he has done so far.<br />I was surprised at the low rankings here for The American. The beautiful shots of the Italian hill country alone were worth a higher ranking. I just finished watching Clooney in Syriana and Out of Sight. I think The American is better than either of these films.
B00B1OEP32|5.0|I was not always a Justin Bieber fan. In fact, I used to be one of his \\"haters\\", although I always respected his talent. I learned to respect him after watching his movie, and then began to really like his music with his Believe album. I was excited for his acoustic album, and purchased it as soon as I could. I have almost exclusively listened to the album after purchasing it on Tuesday and have been more than impressed. I said before that I always respected his talent; the guy has vocal ability like no other of my time, and this production displays this talent more than ever. The album strips away all of the nonsense production stuff that makes songs like \\"Boyfriend\\" and \\"Beauty and a Beat\\" catchy and playable radio tunes, and it allows you to see once again the pure talent that he is blessed with. The songs consist of his voice, a guitar, and a piano here and there, but nothing else.<br />I am in love with the album, and would recommend it hands down to any Justin Bieber fan out there. I would also dare non-fans and even haters/doubters to not necessarily purchase it, but youtube it and take a listen to some of the tunes. I think those people will be pleasantly surprised once they put aside the fact that it's \\"that kid they don't like\\".
B007KQI1NA|3.0|I have been using globalsat USB GPS types for 8-10 yrs as long as I have been running navigation programs on my laptop. This is the first time I buy one again with an opportunity to leave a review. As I just mentioned I am buying one again. Why? well because the last one and every one I had before stopped working woithout notice. I have had maybe 3 or 4. They do come with a warranty, but you have to pay shipping to them and then shipping back. They also make you go through a daunting testing process to make sure it is not their fault. As far as I am concerned, when it has worked for a year and then it stops and I plug in a replacement that works, the GPS has malfunctioned in my book not the computer, no questions, no hassles from GlobalSat allowed. That being said I always have a few spares. They are the cheapest and I have no way of knowing if the Garmin for almost 3 times the money will work for any longer. So don't buy one, buy 3 cause you never know.
B008220B0C|5.0|Got it for my dtr-in-law for Christmas, she loves it.  She and our son watched it the other night again she said.

B0054JELS4|1.0|I ordered this as a gift and disks had obvious defects that didn't allow them to play in any computer or dvd player.  We then decided to replace them with a new set and only three of the eight seasons discs all worked.  Needless to say a very unimpressive purchase for a gift.

1616550414|5.0|Five out of five book. The outside is gorgeous and the gold is foiled. The inside pages are large, full of relevant and interesting information, concept art, non-used characters, ideas, storylines, and some details about the creators and their motives.<br /><br />My initial skimming produced some interesting results, however. The first big thing I noticed as I was a good chunk in: upside-down pages.<br /><br />The page on the left would be oriented normally, and the page on the right would be completely flipped upside-down. Not only that, but it was a repeat of a page later in the book! For example: page 132 was right-side up, and the next page was 274 upside-down. When I got to the &#34;real&#34; page 274 later in the book, it was the same page, but in its correct orientation.<br /><br />Another thing that I noticed was that on a few pages, there was a white edge on the right side that was maybe a half-centimeter thick. Within that, it was visible that the tops of the words &#34;CAUTION: [something something] BOOK&#34; were cut off of some sort of template.<br /><br />I would love to think this misprint of the book will be a collector's item someday, but right now, I feel like the pages that are upside-down and in the wrong locations are robbing me of content that I should be able to have.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is one of those books that you can't stop reading when you start! Every aspect of the book makes you want to know more about the characters and you feel like your part of the story. I'm so proud of Sky and Holder for overcoming such traumatic events and you truly feel the connection between them. My new favorite book of the year. Please keep writing more novels Colleen Hoover! :)
B009H2PCNC|5.0|If the name &#34;Brian Eno&#34; doesn't mean anything to you, then you need read no further. If you're not already a fan, you need not read any further.<br /><br />But ... if you DO know his work, if you're interested in intelligent, thoughtful music, if you've any idea who coined the term &#34;ambient music,&#34; then this recording is one more destination in the long journey and make sure to book your room for a long and enjoyable stay.<br /><br />Eno's ambient works have been plots on a helix, taunting us sometimes with the sense of having heard bits before, only realize that we haven't and he's fooled us again with his mastery of timbre and texture. In a recent interview with fellow audio adventurer Laurie Anderson, Laurie asked him if he'd ever composed music for an elevator (hinting at the criticism aimed at ambient music as being fit for elevators, while alluding to his &#34;Music for Airports&#34;), Brian's response was that it would need to be a very long elevator. But oh, what a ride it would be...
1878424319|5.0|If you haven't read this book yet I highly recommend reading it. Here are the three reasons why I love this book;<br />1) The way it is written. The ideas and concepts it contains are laid out in simple and easy to understand fashion.<br />2) These concepts, if applied into practice, will improve the quality of your life.<br />3) The simplicity and practicality of these four practices make it easier to start incorporating them into your life.

B00AYC4R7G|3.0|For the first time I am disapointed with the Castle series. \\"Significant Others\\" played a worn-out ending plot that let the whole show down.

Which speaks volumes when you don't have to go to 3 countries to find your way...though I would still love to go to the three countries than watch the movie. I am 56 and I can tell you no matter what stage or age of your adult or preadult you are in this is a good bit of assistance along your journey!

0374533571|5.0|I almost never write reviews here, but I loved this book so much that I decided to write one.  READ THIS BOOK.  It is a book that is at the same time so unique and so universal.  It is about a man making a plan to put his life back together.  It is about family relationships and how we can't get away from them and we can't change them, but we can accept them and find a way to make them work in our lives.  It is about a girl who has suffered a loss and her entirely different plan to put her life back together.  It is a story about how these two people who at first seem at odds because their ideas of how to \\"fix things\\" are so different, but little by little they give each other something that helps them heal a little bit more every day.  It is about working hard for happiness and accepting those in your life with love instead of antagonism.  And it is about SO much more.  READ THIS BOOK.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Absolutely one of the best books I've read.....so much historical background along with characters who teach us what life was like throughout the 2nd world war years in Europe.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I first purchased this book for my kindle upon a friend's recommendation.  I enjoyed it so much that I bought the hard back version and had it shipped to my sister-in-law, who is an avid and discerning reader.  It is an interesting story, at times depressing, but overall quite wonderful.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books ABSOLUTELY kept my interest.  I didn't think I'd like them, from what friends had told me about them, but finally read them and LOVED THEM.  Loved the evolution of Christian and Ana's relationship.

B005JABSB6|5.0|I purchased 5 pairs of these Sharp 3D glasses to use with our new 3D TV (March 2011), and have been very happy.  They last a long time between recharges, and we have found that we can recharge them from just about any USB device (the TV itself, a laptop, a 110v to USB adapter, a Wii, a blue ray player) just about anything.  The TV in 3D mode works best in total darkness, as the glasses are dark, and requires a bright screen to work.  We love using these to watch 3D movies.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This story keeps you reading with enough suspense but not to silly. Only down side, little weak in the ending. Expected a bigger bang. Bot okay
1419707671|5.0|These series are great! Although some of the humor in them is a little old for my 8 year-old, he and his friends love it. I couldn't get him to read anything at home and he read each book in one day!!!! And rereads them all!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a wonderful true story with great actors.  Keep your kleenex close as it is a real tear jerker. After I watched this movie I wanted to watch it again. Heartwarming and tells the true story of the unconditional love and loyality our furry family members give us all. Although we all can learn a valuable lesson about dog ownership, I think the possibilities for a child who watches this movie are endless. I would recommend this movie to everyone and know I will watch it again and again.<br /><br />The movie also includes a statement that Akita dogs may not be for everyone which is extremely important for all viewers and people who are considering including a dog to their family. I commend those who made the film for this inclusion.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Funny, characters were awesome, great story line, lots of fun and excitement! Watched twice this with my daughter...we both LOVED IT!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I knew that Sandra Bullock was an incredible actress but once again her performance blew me away. This is a true story and will stay in your hearts and minds for many years to come.  I know I will get my money's worth because I will watch it time and time again. This movie is a must have for all movie collectors who want only quality in their collections. The price was low considering what I received.
B005USZML4|2.0|You presented false advertising for the price and this has coloured my response. See the e-mail I sent today. Cheers
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The perks of being a wallflower is truly an amazing novel. It is happy, sad, moving, and just plain amazing. It hits every emotion. It is written in a great conversational tone and is a must read for any age or stage of life. Stephen Chbosky is a brilliant author.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Compared to Old Temple Run, lots more quick and more beautified landscape.  Maybe less receptive to touch, might be my device.  Still fun and addicting!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is a great to play, game that requires good hand and eye coordination as game gets harder and cool graphics.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|i love all of anne rice's erotic novels and was unsure about reading these but so glad i did :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome, much better then the first. Like the bigger monkey & the zip line. Can hardly wait the what's next.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|Its okay. I really like it and all, but i like the original more. You should definitely get it! Its very addicting!
0399157565|1.0|Reading some of the other reviews I felt like I was in the twilight zone. I wondered if we had the same book in hand. I have always been a fan and have read all the Scarpetta books, but this is the slowest moving novel of the year. Boring, pedantic and mind numbing. I felt like murdering Marino myself. First book in a decade that I could not finish.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|soliloquy much fun and opens up a whole bother world of total ADVENTURE!!!!! it is I said it is WORTH YOUR ZERO DOLLAR AMOUNT this is the besssssttttt game ever that happens to be completely free youll want especially if you liked the first version<br />HINT: a wonderful zip- line and GINORMOUS monkeys!!!!!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Good show, lots of stories intermingling and crossing over, but I don't feel lost ever watching it. Well written, well filmed, and well thought out. Starting season 2 now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever. I would rate this to be about a five star game. I love how they do the world tour thing. It was so smart to do this.  Who ever created this is a phenomenal person. Remember to get this super fun free game from amazon.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|One more time this Batman become a great icon and fully of surprises, I enyoy the whole history like never before, all the three movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I've had it for about a month or two now and I haven't gotten bored. It truly is addicting. I personally like it better than temple run and temple run 2.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game, and never get tired of it. I am just glad it finally made it to the Android platform!
B0076DELIG|5.0|love Connelly books. I am still reading this one and have one on hold when I finish this one. jb
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a really hard game but I love it so lisen to me sorry don't know how to spell I'm just 8
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good game.  Lots of fun to play . I can see ankot of people loving this game . God graphics and fun activities :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really fun I am addicted to it my favourite game I love it so much I play it all the time
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I love the music because  it tells of how the lives of the poor in France survived during the French Revolution.  The melodies are beautiful and the voices of the actors fit the parts very well.  Les Miserables teaches  how lives that were once worth nothing can be turned around into someone of value.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|Will be checking some facts. A must read for any American,who wants our country to prosper and our people advance
B00AXVIBKW|4.0|True North is the strongest album Bad Religion has released since Process of Belief. What I have found to be the most enjoyable aspect of this album is that there are hints of their past albums within many of the songs, without sounding like a band trying to rekindle a magic they never understood.<br /><br />True North and F*** You are the obvious standouts on the albums, but there is plenty of other content to the album to make purchasing the full album worth the cost.<br /><br />It is safe to say that this will be one of the top punk albums of 2013. Time will tell if another band has a solid 5 star album to top this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was extremely great! I hardly ever read, but this book, I just couldn't put it down! I highly suggest reading it.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|An amazing series. Could not put the books down. Must read for anyone who enjoyed who is after something with a twist!

B00122MBRA|4.0|I've always liked this album.  Its a departure from his previous work for sure, but it I still enoy listening to it.  To me, it sounds like its a hard rock album written in the back room of a 1920's speakeasy.  That is the only way I could describe it.  Maybe not for the casual Cooper fan, but a must for any diehard.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Who ever gets this game I think that this game is the best thing ever I play it all the time
072325804X|5.0|It's Peter Rabbit!  How could you not love his mischief!  Hope my grandchildren appreciate these tales in the infotech era,<br />.
B009GQ57ES|1.0|It was difficult to obtain, I still haven't been able to listen to it. Amazon needs to fix that because I'm a frequent customer and that discouraged me a lot.
B009FZFONO|5.0|It has been a while since I actually watched this season (really the 8 episodes they are calling the first half of season 3), I really liked it despite ninja girl's lack of communication. I highly recommend it to anyone, even non-zombie lovers. Can't wait for more episodes to come out!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|UNBELIEVABLE Album!  I honestly had to pull over in my car to track 5 because I started crying I was SO MOVED!  Pulls the heart strings, makes me angry, makes me morally charged!  Cannot put it into words.<br /><br />Imagine my feelings of foolishness that I originally thought Sing For Absolution was an eerie LOVE song!  Although... when you think about... I suppose it is!<br /><br />Cannot express how this album moves me.  Have every one I can get my hands on and look forward to many many more!
B000EXZI0A|5.0|Perhaps the most popular tee shirt next to 'I'm With Stupid' or the James Belushi's 'College'. It's The Ramones. This is American punk/pop defined!!!! Do yourself a favor and listen to this album and then try to get the songs out of your head. Impossible. C'mon people, it is The Ramones!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is the ultimate mahjong as you can constantly change the positioning of the tiles. You can also see a record of the time it took you to complete each of the many puzzles.
B002RVEDE4|5.0|Leonard Cohen is simply the best. He gets it. He knows things. This album takes you back, way back the early 70's and you can really 'feel' it. His voice, not only in song but while interacting with the mesmerized crowd is soothing like a baby's binky. This album is the real deal and should be in The Smithsonian. I love you Leonard Cohen.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Still the best game ever I would rate this game ten out of ten every time. I recommend everyone get this app as soon as possible.
B008MZPUXW|5.0|Easily one of the best albums of 2011. Mr. Halstead is formerly of Mojave 3 and that 90's ill-content thrives on this, his third solo record, It's dark, beautifu, full of hope and soothing. If you like this, pick up his first solo album, Sleeping On Roads and then move on to Oh, Mighty Engine, his second effort, wonderful but in my humble insignificant opinion, not as delicious as the Palindrome Hunches & Sleeping On Roads. To be clear, though, all the albums are great. Go Neil!!!!
0199571120|5.0|It was better than I expected. A combination of dictionary and encyclopedia. I recommend it to everybody interested in speaking English properly.
0439023513|5.0|Book arrived very fast and I read it immediately! I thought this book was the best series ever! I love hunger games!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so cool because its free and I love it because you can take care of a horse
1451673442|5.0|Even though 2012 was a very difficult year, one of the best parts (truly) was finding this book. It's therapeutic, inspirational, reaffirming. I have gifted it to friends and will continue to do so.    I wrote a review on my blog. Here is the link.    [...]    P.S. This isn't a book you should get from the library. Buy it. Read it over and over.
B009AJDET6|4.0|This is Chicago's first 10 studio albums, spanning 1969-1978 (missing only Chicago IV, which was live). The first four of these unquestionably represent the peak of Chicago's creativity, and feature most of their best hits as well.<br /><br />The mastering on these is identical to the mastering on the Rhino reissues from a number of years back, and bonus tracks are included here, just as on the Rhino remasters. The bonus tracks aren't crucial, but they're nice to have. Unfortunately, the mastering is so-so: Louder than is necessary, and ultimately mostly inferior to the original issues (on Columbia, then on Chicago Records). But if you're not an audiophile, you'll be happy enough...<br /><br />These are in mini-sleeves. Gatefolds are not reproduced, and there are no inner liners. In other words, pretty cheap packaging. But it saves a lot of space, and the music's still there.<br /><br />Full track listings, since Amazon has neglected to offer them. All feature bonus tracks except Chicago 1 (CTA) and Chicago III:<br /><br />CD1) Chicago Transit Authority: 1 Introduction, 2 Liberation, 3 Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?, 4 Beginnings, 5 Questions 67-68, 6 Listen, 7 Poem 58, 8 Free Form Guitar, 9 South California Purples, 10 I'm a Man, 11 Prologue, 12 Someday,<br /><br />CD2) Chicago (Expanded): 1 Movin' In, 2 The Road, 3 Poem for the People, 4 In the Country, 5 Wake Up Sunshine, 6 Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon, 7 Fancy Colours, 8 25 or 6 to 4, 9 Memories of Love, 10 It Better End Soon, 11 Where Do We Go from Here, 12 Make Me Smile (Single Version), 13 25 Or 6 To 4 (Single Version),<br /><br />CD3) Chicago III: 1 Sing a Mean Tune, 2 Loneliness Is Just a World, 3 What Else Can I Say, 4 I Don't Want Your Money, 5 Travel Suite, 6 Mother, 7 Lowdown, 8 An Hour in the Shower, 9 Elegy,<br /><br />CD4) Chicago V (Expanded): 1 A Hit by Varese, 2 All Is Well, 3 Now That You've Gone, 4 Dialogue (Part 1), 5 Dialogue (Part 2), 6 While the City Sleeps, 7 Saturday in the Park, 8 State of the Union, 9 Goodbye, 10 Alma Mater, 11 A Song For Richard and His Friends, 12 Mississippi Delta City Blues, 13 Dialogue (Part I and III) (Single Version),<br /><br />CD5) Chicago VI (Expanded): 1 Critics' Choice, 2 Just You `n' Me, 3 Darlin' Dear, 4 Jenny, 5 What's This World Comin' To, 6 Something in This City Changes People, 7 Hollywood, 8 In Terms of Two, 9 Rediscovery, 10 Feelin' Stronger Every Day, 11 Beyond All Our Sorrows, 12 Tired Of Being Alone (TV Special),<br /><br />CD6) Chicago VII (Expanded): 1 Prelude to Aire, 2 Aire, 3 Devil's Sweet, 4 Italian From New York, 5 Hanky Panky, 6 Life Saver, 7 Happy Man, 8 (I've Been) Searchin' So Long, 9 Monogonucleosis, 10 Song of the Evergreens, 11 Byblos, 12 Wishing You Were Here, 13 Call on Me, 14 Woman Don't Want to Love Me, 15 Skinny Boy, 16 Byblos (Rehearsal),<br /><br />CD7) Chicago VIII (Expanded): 1 Anyway You Want, 2 Brand New Love Affair (Part 1 & 2), 3 Never Been in Love Before, 4 Hideaway, 5 Till We Meet Again, 6 Harry Truman, 7 Oh Thank You Great Spirit, 8 Long Time No See, 9 Ain't It Blue, 10 Old Days, 11 Sixth Sense (Rehearsal), 12 Bright Eyes (Rehearsal), 13 Satin Doll (Live),<br /><br />CD8) Chicago X (Expanded): 1 Once or Twice, 2 You Are on My Mind, 3 Skin Tight, 4 If You Leave Me Now, 5 Together Again, 6 Another Rainy Day in New York City, 7 Mama Mama, 8 Scrapbook, 9 Gently I'll Wake You, 10 You Get It Up,11 Hope for Love, 12 I'd Rather Be Rich, 13 Your Love's An Attitude,<br /><br />CD9) Chicago XI (Expanded): 1 Mississippi Delta City Blues, 2 Baby What a Big Surprise, 3 Till the End of Time, 4 Policeman, 5 Take Me Back to Chicago, 6 Vote for Me, 7 Takin' It on Uptown, 8 This Time, 9 The Inner Struggles of a Man, 10 Prelude (Little One), 11 Little One, 12 Wish I Could Fly, 13 Paris,<br /><br />CD10) Hot Streets (Expanded): 1 Alive Again, 2 The Greatest Love on Earth, 3 Litlle Miss Lovin', 4 Hot Streets, 5 Take a Chance, 6 Gone Long Gone, 7 Ain't It Time, 8 Love Was New, 9 No Tell Lover, 10 Show Me the Way, 11 Love Was New (Alt),ver, 10 Show Me the Way, 11 Love Was New (Alt),
0312427573|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  Can't believe I waited so many years to read it. Love it.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|I had been on a kick listening to this album from beginning to end for a few weeks. This album is very thoughtfully put together and each song has a purpose and its own place within the album. I have so many favorite tracks from this album. I especially love the track &#34;The Wolves&#34; it's fun, full of energy and I love the use of howling. It all adds to a very organic and folklore-feel. Songs like &#34;The Wolves&#34; and &#34;Old Pine&#34; are reminiscent of spontaneous, unharnessed, and free-spirited times. &#34;Only Love&#34; and &#34;Keep Your Head Up&#34; are both forceful tracks in their own regard and really showcase his abilities to satisfy his singer-songwriter creativity, what appeals to listeners, and let's face it, what sells. &#34;Black Flies&#34; is another favorite and digs deep. Ben Howard conveys much emotion in his tone and each inflection carries with it meaning and penetrates the listener. On this track, the effects of howling is utilized once again but in a different way; instead of a free-spirited feel, it lends itself to feelings of loneliness and yearning. I could go on and on breaking down each track, but I'll just leave the rest up to you. Overall this album had everything I wanted, from low to high. This album does a great job of highlighting the range of styles that Ben Howard is capable of. The shakiness of his voice, the inherent animalistic/humanistic sounds, and the soothing, long and earthy tones all blend together to create something very magical, saddened, and endlessly intriguing.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works well on Kindle Fire, can set for local weather easily. Have had some slow updating of info, but it has always completed the loading of data.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Bought it for my wife and she is very happy with it. Easy to use and the voice quality is excellent
B002W5UVSM|3.0|I first read this book almost forty years ago and was truly entertained but a lot has happened since then and on my second reading I found it just ok.  Don't ask me what changed my mind.  Life has a way of taking the shine off of most of everything.  One of the most interesting parts of the book is its history.  The author's mother found the manuscript after he had died and she began a relentless search until she found a publisher.  Mother's love.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I just love this movie, and I' m not even a dog person ! But , I am a cryer ! And I think I used a whole box of tissues , on this wonderful story ! It is based on a true story , but modernized quite a bit ! After watching the film , I googled Hachi  and read numerous accounts of the authentic story . This movie may not be as factual as it could be , but the basic story is still there ------ a dogs lifelong devotion to his master !!  Richard Gere is so sweet in this film !
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I don't know how many books Grisham has written but I do know it is a mess of them.  Evidently the boy is slipping into auto pilot.  He follows his proven formula from previous books but just fills the voids with different characters and motives.  It may be time for him to make a change.  Just please don't 'see Jesus.'
B003EYVXTG|5.0|good movie shows a differnt side of life. i grew up in mo so i can relate to life in the back woods off the beaten path
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing that i can't believe how good this game works I recommend this game to every one and I hope that everyone enjoys this game this game should have an award.kid's can play this game and its fun I love this game.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|They did a fine job in keeping in line with the original work. I was afraid that they would water it down for content, but fortunately they had not; it was bloody and gritty to the very end. My only complaint was that it was a tad bit short, and I wasn't sure this feature necessarily needed to be split into two parts.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who likes rock n roll to see the flip side, but I also suggested to my friends who are drug counselors to read it too because it's a scary vision into what addiction feels like. It's sad to read a lot of times, but hopeful because he managed to kick the habit.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|\\"For the story of history's greatest manhunt for the world's most dangerous man\\".<br /><br /> Osama Bin Ladin was NOT the MASTERMIND behind the Trade Centers Disasters, the mattermind was KHALID DHEIK MUHAMMAD - Osama was a patsy to divert attention away from what the Bush Administration and the CIA were doing and the Congressional investigation was and is a farce.<br /><br /> It's Only a movie ABOUT thier version of what didn't actually happen.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|the game is fun but. I wish that the recharge time would be quicker. it'd also be nicer for the bottom slot be wider since its annoying.
B003XT603Q|4.0|I haven't finished this book yet, but really enjoy it so far.  The Kindle version is very good and does not have many of the glitches that some of the other books get when they are converted to Kindle format.  It works perfectly with my Kindle.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game looks terrific, and I love the mine cart levels.  The pay in game for upgrades feature is not as appealing.
B007N9FKCY|1.0|This isn't the type of game that I normally play. That being said, I'm basing my rating on my preference of games.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Its like the greatest app ever!!!!! When I don't go to my sports, a quick hour workout perfect!! Def recommend it.(:
B004GVUPFE|3.0|I played it once or twice - that was enough. Nothing special about this game. Maybe higher levels would be more challenging.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This site has so many great ideas.  Just search for any topic and you find many pins on the topic!
0374214913|3.0|Nerdville I have visited! The title grabbed me. I mean who wouldn't love a 24-hour bookstore! Give me the directions to it!<br /><br />But a nerd, and more nerds, MAJOR nerds. All this tech talk, blah blah blah for this reader. Half the time I was thinking yea yea yea whatever that means. BUT I so loved talking about books, I am a lover of books that smell. If you are a booklover, then you totally know what I mean! Don't pretend like you don't!!<br /><br />I really loved the budding romance between our narrorator, Clay and Kat. Who doesn't love a good mystery? Clay is out of a job, and one day comes upon Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, who has a help wanted sign in the window. When Clay is hired for the night shift, he soon discovers that this isn't a regular bookstore. Clay and all his nerdy friends try to crack this code, and still live.<br /><br />What kind of code you ask? Honestly, I have no idea! That is where I got lost. This part of the book I just smiled and went on. It was very enjoyable to have reading and books come together, but so much information about stuff I don't understand and am not knowledgable in. Enjoyable none the less!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The original theatrical editions of the classic Star Wars trilogy, particularly Episode IV-A New Hope, while they contain many amazing moments, do have their warts, that AREN'T THAT GREAT.  I can see why, and am glad, that George Lucas changed some shots.  I like some of the changes Lucas made.  I don't like others.  But, overall, I feel Mr. Lucas has impeccable taste, the tweaks are justified, and the stories and rich entertainment value of this galactic space epic are intact, which is what's important.<br /><br />Obviously, too many of you rabid, fanatical purists are holding on too tightly (rumble and creaking sound of clutched gloved-hand Vader stranglehold tightening around your own necks) to the original theatrical cuts of Star Wars IV-VI as one of your most cherished childhood memories (they were an important part of my childhood too).  The painful fact is:  YOU have changed.  YOU are no longer children.  You've lost that tender, innocent, idealistic core of youth, where the universe is all open and new, and have become jaded, nit-picking adult cynics.  It happens.  Get used to it.  Deal with it.<br /><br />Some of you are truly an ungrateful, spoiled, \\"glass is half-empty\\" bunch of brats, who are too busy nit-picking what you feel are \\"faults\\" in these latest versions of the films, instead of enjoying the rich entertainment legacy that is right in front of you!  If YOU have the talent, which I doubt, make your own films.  YOU then will explore this creative process.  YOU then will be in control.  YOU then can make exactly the films YOU want to see.<br /><br />Meanwhile, you should be THANKING Mr. Lucas for offering his groundbreaking, legendary Star Wars saga AT ALL on blu-ray, especially in the stellar high-def transfers that he has offered!  These look and sound gorgeous.  These are the finest transfers, especially of Episode IV-A New Hope, that I've ever seen outside a cinema, and I saw New Hope, in particular, in A LOT of cinemas as a kid.<br /><br />Yes, it would be nice to own the classic, unaltered versions of Star Wars Episodes IV-VI on blu-ray in superb HD transfers from pristine film prints, IN ADDITION to these \\"tweaked\\" versions, just to see the evolution of ideas in Mr. Lucas' mind, to compare today's visual-effects technology with the more \\"quaint\\" visual-effects technology of the time they were made, as well as to enjoy the tighter, faster, more kinetic ride of the original theatrical versions (the original theatrical versions are shorter).<br /><br />With the recent acquisition of Star Wars by Disney, we may just get our wish!  There may just be pristine prints of Episodes IV-VI somewhere, begging for Disney to archive and do a proper HD transfer and blu-ray release of.  If that happens, I will proudly add the original cuts to these cuts.  If that happens, hopefully that will finally put an end to this incessant bitching, by some of you, for the original versions.  You will then have to find something new to bitch about.<br /><br />Meanwhile, try to relax, calm the clutter of your minds, hear the Meticlurians of the Force speaking to you, and, with time and training, Ani, you too will get back to that tender core of youth, that is still inside you.  It's called suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />+++++<br /><br />The special features are pretty comprehensive!  We get a tour inside Skywalker Ranch, interviews with all the artists involved in the making of these films, documentaries, spoofs, 2 commentary tracks, as well as a \\"descriptive audio track\\", per film, and many, many other goodies.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching the vintage documentaries, particularly SP-FX:  The Empire Strikes Back, a treatise on the evolution of special visual-FX in cinema, which Star Wars is certainly an important part of.  I also enjoyed watching the various Star Wars spoofs, spin-offs and references!  Obviously, Mr. Lucas isn't too precious with his creation; he doesn't mind having others poke a little fun at it (as long as they pay licensing fees to Lucasfilm, of course).<br /><br />One spoof that was ommitted, or perhaps wasn't available, and would've been nice to have, was Ernie Facilius' Hardware Wars, which the youngster helmed right after the original Star Wars was made in 1977.  Hardware Wars shows ordinary household appliances, like irons and toasters, zapping lasers at each other in space.  Thankfully, a few shots of this \\"opus\\" CAN be seen in SP-FX:  The Empire Strikes Back!<br /><br />Also (scratching head) curiously omitted from the extras on this blu-ray set, and that would've been nice to have, is the excellent Empire of Dreams documentary, produced and directed by Kevin Burns, found on disc 4 of the Star Wars original Episodes IV-VI trilogy DVD set released in 2004.  It chronicles the dismal state the world was in BEFORE the original Star Wars was released in 1977, how Hollywood movies were equally grim, and the rags-to-riches story of George Lucas and his struggle to get the original Star Wars on the screen, as well as his struggle to make the successful sequels, or, rather, parts of its continuing story.<br /><br />Also (scratching head) curiously missing from this blu-ray set are all the wonderful web documentaries, found on the previous DVDs of Episodes I-III, the prequels, chronicling each and every aspect of the making of these films.  These short web documentaries were originally shown online, on Lucasfilm's website, as the prequels were in the process of being made, to generate excitement for their upcoming release.  I and other tech-heads and artists found these quite fascinating.  If you've already purchased the Star Wars movies on DVD, hold onto those DVD sets, as they are the only way to see and enjoy these great special features!<br /><br />Meanwhile, these are a generous offering, and a powerful ride.  Fire up the HDTV and surround sound system, with subwoofer, and enjoy those massive, rumbling Star Destroyers!f the Star Wars original Episodes IV-VI trilogy DVD set, as well as all the web documentaries chronicling every aspect of the making of the prequels on the prequel DVDs, which I found quite fascinating.  If you've already purchased the Star Wars movies on DVD, hold onto those DVD sets, as they are the only way to see these special features!<br /><br />Meanwhile, fire up the surround sound system, with subwoofer, and enjoy those rumbling Star Destroyers!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This simple game isa nice time waster. It's not difficult to do but sometimes makes you think a little outside the box in solving. I like it.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and Child are without a doubt the best authors I have read!  Two Graves was a fantastic ending of the Helen Trilogy; I do hope this is not the end of Pedergast and D'Acosta stories as that would make me very sad!

B001AGXEAG|5.0|i love it !!!the movie looks great and is very very funny.its perfect for the whole family!tons of great special features!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I was watching the series on PBS and when I found this was available through Amazon(great price) I just could not wait. Watched the remaining episodes as soon as it arrived. Great!!!!!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is another wonderful addition to the family of angry birds games. I only wish I could play more often.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|THE ULTIMATE IN MINDLESS ENTERTAINMENT. THE WHOLE ZOMBIE THING IS STARTING TO TAPER-OFF BUT THIS SHOW IS MORE THAN JUST DEAD PEOPLE EATING LIVE PEOPLE. I LOVE IT
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book!!!! It is one of my all-time favorites!!! It wasn't just because it was creative but it was enlightening.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great set, for a great price.  I got this on a golden box deal, and couldn't be happier.  My girlfriend who didn't see these growing up (I know...) loves how spielberg made these look like &#34;old&#34; movies.  I explained that this was called real movie making.<br /><br />Great heroes, good bad guys, and at the time crazy special effects.  &#34;cover your heart indy!&#34;
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I just love the color and protection it provides my kindle!!! I'm very happy with my choice, would like to have a keyborard though.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Enjoyable, worth while. I like most of the actors and they seemed to work well together. Good action adventure. Leaved its self open for a follow up adventure.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it's pretty cool. Graphics are nice, just wish you could customize more. The person isn't customized. Other than that is fun
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Engaging and fun and weird and the right amount of gross. Loved it. Can't wait to watch it again tomorrow. The mashups are brilliant
B008B92U32|5.0|Very neat app that works well. If this app gets a bad review it's probably user error because everything worked fine for me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love thank you very much I will recommend to all my friends
B00B2V66VS|5.0|One of the best games I have played. Graphics are awesome. Gameplay is simple and addictive. I can't stop playing.

B002PYW26O|5.0|Nicely done.  A updated Movie verision of the old TV series.  Good action and special effects.  I enjoyed this movie very much.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love thank you very much I will recommend to all my friends
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have loved this game. Just like taking care of a real horse. My daughter loves caring for her own horse as well.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|got this by mistake instead of the original movie version but after watcing it, i loveLove Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love thank you very much I will recommend to all my friends
B00422LESO|4.0|Quite entertaining despite a few typos and sometimes confusing transitions between first and third person narratives. The story was delightful and the \\"Austin\\" like language  made for a fun and easy read.  The  main character, Jane, was extremely likeable. She was  witty and charming and could make me laugh out loud. I would recommend this book to everyone. Can't wait for the movie to come out!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love thank you very much I will recommend to all my friends
B0082SU98U|5.0|Classic's always have different versions of the story, but each one brings some thing to the table. So even if you already own a different version try this one too. It won't disappoint.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Gave this as a Christmas present to my massage therapist. She is a big fan. She loved the voice/ music.
B001GXYBY6|5.0|Has anyone in the world not heard of Speed Racer? Take a break and watch this with your kids and remember how it felt comming home from school and getting your snack, cozying down in Dad's favorite chair with your shoes off to see the gang in another zaney adventue race aginst bad guys. And don't for get the masked stranger Driver X who in secret is really no other than...... oops almost gave it away
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Really like the game. I think if it is a free game, you shouldn't. have to pay for it when you are half way through the game.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Superb special effects, great acting. The movie grips you from start to finish.It is brutal so the movie should be watched before showing it to kids.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome I lllllooooovvvvveeeee subway surfers the cool mystery box's cause it gets you cool things like people and coins and all of it cause it's just so fun you won't believe it.
B001EBROWQ|5.0|I'm so glad it was made.. the richness of the film is excellent. Everyone who has ever seen it has been touched in one way or another.must have for your library.
0525953728|5.0|Really enjoyed this book - it kept me in supense the whole time and it was very thorough in explaining things.  Would recommend it for people who like this type of reading.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is the book and as I told my daughter several years ago, the movies of these classic's are great but don't hold a candle to the whole rich book. My daughter tried this storie out and fell in love. She has a whole library of old classic's and listens to them all the time as she has poor eyesight and reading causes headaches. Don't mind getting out of reading detail either...LOL
B004LP3AYI|3.0|The sexual undertones get to be annoying.  Some parts would have been much better without them.  A woman would never ride a horse nude into battle in the winter.
0792164903|5.0|Johnny Depp was perfect for this roll...It was a little different than the usual storie and had Johnnie using all kinds of neat contraptions. Was very intriging.
B00821OUT6|2.0|The first episode was just way too tedious.  I thought I was watching one of those bad, made-for-SyFy movies, except a lot of them don't seem to take themselves as seriously as this did--the petty, high school drama and wooden acting made me think the Earth deserved to be taken over by aliens--I was thinking, all they need to do to defeat the skitters is to make them watch this show--they'd they'd either die of boredom or pack everything up and zoom back off into space to find some other another planet where they haven't invented TV yet.  So why did I give 2 stars instead of one--my hand slipped.
B00ALQSNV6|5.0|This is another dinosaure video that won't disappoint. If you like learning all you can about these great animals this is one to add to your library.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is probly the best app ever invented who.would not  like to run for coins and buy amazing charecters
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|A whole family must see and own because you'll watch it again and again, year after year and love it and enjoy it more and more every time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is sooooooooo cool. the graphics are amazing. I loved temple run one and temple run two is a million times better.
B001NZREUA|5.0|What can I say?  1975, Dregs were ahead of their time. I have enjoyed this album since its release.  I have never tired of listening to it.  Just have gone from record album, to cassette to CD and now digital.  LOL
B003JVH7XU|5.0|fun and entertaining, the fight scenes are amazing, all of the fighters are very talented.  I recommend this movie to any martial arts lover
B00122HRMO|5.0|This album has their foundation song - their defining artistic effort.  Mother Russia.  The song is hauntingly beautiful.  The rest of the album and their other efforts are very solid.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is da best.........I love how the game background changes every month(I think)<br />but otherwise,I really recommend you getting this game!
B000VWIBOO|5.0|This is from the golden era of Elton John.  He had not quite peaked as of yet, but this was a very important effort in his evolution as an artist.  What a prolific contributor over the decades.
B008XG1X18|5.0|like the title of this description say its a great app. have y'all thought about adding videos to tha pins?
0887431453|5.0|My son got the hang of it and did like 5 pages and wanted to do more saying the book was really fun.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book made me laugh so hard that I cried. I could relate to her and this made me sure that I would want to be her friend if I were lucky enough to live in her world. Great, quick read.
B006ZS4SHC|4.0|Kids liked it. Duh! nothing else to say dude.  Your review process is stupid and obviously not to be trusted since you demand a certain # of words.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was a very touching and loving story that filled my heart. I am looking forward to seeing the movie an  see if it's as good.
B009SQR28A|5.0|We first watched this movie before Christmas.  The whole family LOVED it but especially my granddaughter.  She couldn't see it enough.  So one day, while I was taking care of her, I decided to purchase it.  It was the best purchase so far.  She watches it every time she visits me.  She LOVES Arthur.  I would recommend this movie for anyone.
B00AE2I4B6|4.0|So, this rag-tag group of dancers puts together absolutely dazzling routines in a matter of a few hours.  Six months of choreography and practice crammed in to a couple of days.  Fabulous props, great costume changes accomplished in nano-second, thousands of dollar bills floating in the air, pyrotechnics, it was just great.
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|this is okay for a free app. I am surprised that it was free.This is a good deal for me because I got one other app similar ti this but it cost 99 cents. The problem with this is it takes forever to download.
B00005JMCW|4.0|Freaky Friday is a funny remake of the 70s version. It is family friendly and it was listed for a good price.
B000AS4L16|5.0|When this arrived, I immediately sat down and watched the entire 9.5 hours at one sitting. As a serious student of the Holocaust, and as one who is writing my Masters Thesis on this subject, I found this to be extremely informative and very well done. At no time did the sub-titles get in the way, nor did they distract me from the person speaking. The fact that there was no file footage used in this made it all the more stark and realistic. I would advise anyone who seriously wants to learn more about the Holocaust, to watch this. It doesn't get any more real than this!
B0024RIMBG|5.0|As I staed before, these ladies are very mature and exceptional gifted.  They sing like no one else and they are very talented.  Love the lyrics and the music.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A little far fetched.....but totally entertaining.  Not a big fan of Stephen King, but loved this one as did everyone I know that<br />read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so aswome. ........... it is cool game to I'm in 2 place to.  I all ways win. and hope you like it to
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Couldn't wait to read it before the movie comes out.  Just a nice feel good story that you would expect from Nicholas sparks.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|movie was not what we thought by the trailer. was not funny, not the usual Mark Walhberg quality so we were disappointed.
0199219222|5.0|Received the book on time very happy with my purchase. The book was in very good shape too with no pages ruined.
0765325950|5.0|The book is one of the best, there's still some dead parts but the book itself still rocks.. Great book!!
0393312836|5.0|Received the book on time very happy with my purchase. The book was in very good shape too with no pages ruined.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An interesting tale of an apocalyptic world.  I enjoyed it very much and couldn't put it down until I finished.  Looking forward to reading more by Hugh Howdy.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|The gameplay for these games is unresponsive. Not something I could play often. Uninstalled soon after playing for a few minutes
B005NJU8PA|3.0|The chapter on meta-learning was far and away the best.<br /><br />The rest rambled a lot and in my mind did not tie together well.  As well, I am not sure how many actual cooking skills he taught.<br /><br />So read the chapter on meta-learning to understand his process, and to learn to cook, go spend time with your grandmother.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is difficult to put down.  I like the scientific/medical approach to explaining the NDE and the point that the medical field should no longer discount this experience as a bodies physical response to the trauma of the disease or injury process.  It is time we search deeper into our existence and all the possibilities in our human experience. For those that are on the fence on this subject, I highly recommend this book.  If after you read this book and you are not just a little more open to this subject would be a surprise.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|My kids love this. I also like it but I don't use it as much as they do. It's a fun distraction when you want to kill a little time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This  is very fun.it is very fun and very challenging.I recommend this game for kids.I believe that kids will enjoy this game very much and have fun playing it
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I had never watched this movie until my girlfriend made me watch it and I don't regret it at all. So I bought it I loved it so much.
B008DKBPTO|5.0|Love the look and the size of envelope sleeve.  It is just what I was looking for and it fits into my purse with ease.  Arrived quickly
160774273X|1.0|Very, very difficult for a beginner bread baker.  Bought this for my 81 year old Mom, who then couldn't return it so I bought it from her so she wouldn't be STUCK with it!!  Now, what am I supposed to do with it??
0345803485|5.0|this book is so intriging cannot wait to read the rest of the series<br />where can you find someone like christian
0307450570|5.0|I bougth this item for my grand daugther who is deligthed with it, and looks forward to many hours of crafting it was the Martha Stewarts Encyclopdia of crafts
B0088WGBC8|5.0|As usual in any Danzel Washington movie there were great actors and his performance was exceptional.  It has a different plot but was carefully unwound and entertaining to watch.
142313866X|5.0|We saw this when we were at Disneyland. It is a great series. I can't wait to have them all.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita, Thank you for so eloquently putting my experience in words.  Much love to you and each person you have touched with this book...
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love this case! It goes underwater with me, in the shower playing music and so much more! The only thing I don't like is the muffling of sound and calls.
B0012GMXBK|4.0|In 1985 I saw Accept opening for Krokus in Madison WI. It was great to get a piece of my youth back. At a reasonable price.
B008J34466|5.0|This is great is has a bit of everything and she does duets with big name artists. Definitely a must have if you're a Pink Fan!
B000P0J09W|5.0|I bought this for my nices and myself. It's a fun clean kids movie with a simple plot but the sets ans cinematography are great.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love this app disagree with other reviewers that it kills battery, it doesnt on mine. i really like the hoe it tells you available hours for all the different applications ie internet browsing, wifi, mobile/ music playback and video playback. best of all its free.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was very surprised when I played Temple Run 2. It was better than part 1 or the Brave addition. The graphics are outstanding , they really gave the game depth behind the scenes. It's a fast pace game that needs quick reflexes. Love love love this game..it's addicting and my new favorite!!
B00B1OEP32|5.0|As a mom of a tween I have been subjected to Justin's music on replay for what...3 years? I can honestly say this album is on fire. His music has matured with him and has turned into one h$ll of a beast. Justin is a force to be reckoned with. Justin really brings it in the new tracks and proves he is here to stay. Momma has a musical crush on Bieber's music.  He gotten pretty sexy too. Don't mind the poster covered walls. ;)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game addicted To it , will keep u entertained for a few hours , could do with different levels tho they are all the same
1401907725|5.0|Gift for a friend. Recommended by a friend. Very healing, very deep. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking healing in their lives.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is tough yo but I think it needs to upgrade the holiday season special and bigger picture and effects but still I love this game
1878424319|5.0|Recommended by a friend. Very healing, very deep. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking healing in their lives.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love it is very funny.<br /><br />I would give this book to kids 7-14<br />Love it.  I give it 5 stars
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game so much. I'm completely addicted. I cant stop playing. its all I want to do so props to u!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I felt that this version was much easier than the frre version.  The symbols were much smaller but stilleasier to match.
B00AW0KGYI|1.0|Go to Walmart.com and order the two movie extended copy. You'll get pt 1 and pt 2. You'll get the extras as well as a digital copy for 5 dollars above what you would pay for just the one movie.You pay $24.00 and you get all the above. I think that's worth it versus buying separately.Different stores have different deals, and this one was the best that I found so far. I haven't ordered yet because I am still shopping around. You never know when you can find a better deal.I figure I was gonna pay $19.99 for pt 2, I just cough up $5.00 more and get pt 1 with the extras and the digital copy too.  These movie studios do try to choke the dollars out of your wallet and they wonder why people bootleg their stuff. I personally love HD and Blu-Ray. I'm spoiled I guess. Hope this helps someone.
0316069434|1.0|Like most reviewers, I have read every Connelly novel.  It appears that Connelly is tired of Harry Bosch, because Bosch has become a real jerk---arrogant, self-righteous, unethical, rude, and phony. Frankly, I no longer care about him either.  As for the actual book, there is no character development.  Poor David Chu is a caricature of an Asian cop/computer geek.  Harry treats him like dirt.  Harry's self serving lieutenant is straight out of a comic book.  His teenage daughter has no substance.  etc. etc. etc.  The plot is so old and tired and its resolution so trite that an astute reader could see it coming a mile away.  The writing itself is stilted and graceless.  Furthermore, there are little inconsistencies and mistakes that a responsible editor should have caught.  All in all, this book is a waste of time and money. Sad, because the early Bosch books were filled with style, creativity, and passion.  Those days are over.  Readers who like accurate police/crime literature should skip Connelly and try Archer Mayor and his Joe Gunther series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is fun; the increased speed keeps you on your toes! The different locations keep it interesting.  Can play for hours.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is one of those that you can't wait to get back to but you force yourself to read slowly so it lastrs longer.  Absolutely entertaining, somewhat historically educational and so humorous that you find yourself laughing outloud no matter where you are....doctor's office, airplane, etc. Would certainly recommend it to anyone over 50 years old and I think even the younger group would enjoy it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I am appreciative of what all the SF troops do and it was a great read in a &#34;day in the life&#34; book
B008K7WCJM|1.0|Having enjoyed the Swans' music for many years, I was eager and excited to listen to &#34;Seer&#34; given all of the hype and rave reviews. I'd sooner drink gasoline than listen to this disastrous &#34;masterpiece&#34; again. It gave me more than a headache. It left me feeling like there's not an ounce of hope left in this world. Musically it's annoying noise and lyrically it's lifeless. The vocals are far worse than my own pathetic attempts to sing. They have way more talent than this, and I'm finding it hard to believe that their entire body of music led to this. I suppose one needs to be in the &#34;right frame of mind&#34; to appreciate &#34;Seer&#34;. Perhaps there's a special decoding drug that makes it more palatable. I can't get rid of it fast enough.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't think I would like the series. It is not so bad. Once you get into the love affair , it really keeps your interest. Christian and Anastasia are fascinating. Hard to put down.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|There was a lot of action which my husband enjoys but the plot was hard to follow.  The sound was also not good.  We were continually turning the sound up or down in order to understand what the characters were saying.  It was worth watching but not Academy Award material.
B0068FYZ9S|3.0|The movie was great BUT! IT WAS ON ONE DVD. it should have been two copys a blu-ray and dvd copy just look in product  details.I just wanted two copys
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I like watching my Youtube subscriptions, I like it a lot.  You can use it to sign into your account
B0011EU0NG|5.0|We loved watching this movie with the whole family!!! My daughter loved the car and everything about the movie. She say the song for days!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing Subway Surfer.  It is one the most entertaining games I have played in a while.  I reach for it when I wake up... and usually go to sleep playing it.
B009S8PEHY|3.0|So So...wouldn't buy again!!! Should have put more thought into the purchase.  I do like the duet with Michael Buble.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book was at times hard to read simply because it was so painfully honest.  It is nearly impossible not to get devoured by empathy for this boy who was by all accounts a victim of his environment.  The author presents Shin's life in a way that is human, and what I mean by that is, he doesn't try to sensationalize his experience but rather accepts it and embraces Shin's very human response to extreme trauma.  This story pushes you to question your own morals; what would you have done if you had been born into Shin's life?<br />Warning; don't pick up this book if you have somewhere to be in an hour.  I couldn't put it down once I started.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Great for looking up long words and to practice spelling with your 1st and 2nd grader also good for learning English.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was very good, I hated to put it down.<br />Love it when it's not predictable.<br />I recommend it!
B003WTE886|5.0|I bought this album &#34;used like new&#34; and item was as described.  It really was like opening a new album :).Loved this album!! Her songs &#34;SPEAK&#34; to you literally!!  I pretty much love all her songs minus a few haha.  My favorites are haunted, long live and enchanted :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching this show and was delighted that this was something I could watch with my 20 year old daughter and my 90 something grandparents. My daughter could learn a little history without force (like putting spinach in brownies), and the grandparents could delight in the costumes, cinematography and the whole 'Englishness' of the series. Of course anything by Masterpiece has been good but this is GREAT. I plan on purchasing all the season and giving the as gifts for my families. Yeah to the producers of this show. We love it and I wait each week for the new episode. I have several of my freind hooked as well. This is good, quality family television. (for any who haven't seen it no nudity, no swearing, some war-related and jail -related mail violence). It is a winner!!,,
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|Item as described!! Mine was &#34;used like new&#34; and everything was perfect.  No scratches or skipping.  Love this album.  All her songs are so heartfelt and definitely better than her last 2.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My daughter has been bugging me for this CD for awhile now. I have checked several other places and it was just to high. I bought a used CD on this site and to look at it you would never be able to tell it was used. It is in great shape and plays very well. My daughter loves it and listens to it everyday. I am glad to be able to buy her great things that she really wants at very affordable prices.
1451695195|4.0|This book relates the experiences of a highly acclaimed neurosurgeon when he lay near death.  His medical training serves him well when he documents his physical condition, and his scientific background enhances the details of his journey.  The only negative I experienced was perhaps his unwillingness or inability to curb the analytical details and just fly with the amazing journey.  It is clear, however, that he emphasized the professorial details to lend credence to the experience.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This was a wonderful classic. I have wanted to read this book for an long time, so sad that I didn't read it sooner. I am still thinking about their hardships, and living in the slums of New York City. The most wonderful read!
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|\\"Brutal. Just brutal.\\"<br /><br />This is what i murmured to a couple of ushers, (standing outside of the theatre I had been sentenced to spend time inside) they, mercifully standing outside of viewing and hearing distance from this.. movie. (Yes i was jealous..) I had never been so happy to have drinken too much soda. While in the restroom I remember thinking- \\"Boy! Would this be a good time for a kidney stone!\\". It really would have been. That or a random beating.<br /><br />This has to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The best part of Life of Pi were the 15 minutes I snuck away to watch Skyfall. While it may have been a good read, what you're subjected to onscreen for me was unbearable. This movie is basically a slower and chattier version of Cast Away. But with a tiger. Who apparently is a vegetarian. Life of Pi makes Cast Away look like Speed Racer.<br /><br />It's also a drug movie. Vivid colors and visuals are apparent throughout- dancing dolphins and whales singing showtunes in the sky and such. I was later told that I (and i wasn't aware of this) was supposed to lick the ticket stub! An apparent, 'yeah we know' laced acknowledgment from one of the more troubled theatre employees. As our hero hallucinates, voluntarily ingesting salt water to pick up the pace of this yarn, he sails afloat the ocean for a good oh.. 5 or 6 weeks, having rap battles with his accompanied tiger and such. He eventually lands on an island! A MAAAN EAAATING ISLAAAND~! But he wins it over by liking it on facebook. And yes, you guessed it, resurrects MTV's the grind and makes it all real live in a tropical setting. Ain't no party liike a marsupial paarrtaay~!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I liked the book becuase it had twists to the story...the deeper you got into it, the more captivating it became.
0307730697|5.0|I just finished reading Fearless by Eric Blehm. This is a book that will touch your heart, inspire you, make you laugh, and make you cry. The book follows the life story of Adam Brown and how he went from a crack addict to a top level Navy SEAL.<br /><br />This is one of the books you read in just a day or two because you won't be able to put it down. As I got closer to the end I was hoping it would end miraculously instead of with his death, but I knew he died. It was sad to get toward the end and read about his death, but inspiring and necessary.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend reading this book. Not only is it entertaining, it will help you remember never to take for granted what you have and live each day as if it may be your last.<br /><br />Tiny note that this book does contain some language - but I expected it might considering the subject matter. However, I was a little surprised it was published like this with a Christian publisher. Still absolutely worth reading, though.<br /><br />I received a copy of this book from Blogging For Books in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is like the old temple run just way better.  The old temple run was okay but was not complete.  They have added levels and ropes to slide down.  Instead of three monkey things there is now one.  I give it 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its so much fun! its extremely addicting and everyone should get it! I love horses and this is perfect! anyone else who loves horses would enjoy this app too!

B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is fun. It is a lot of work. A lot of time is put in. I really like it.

0375703764|5.0|this book is amazing, crazy story, multiple stories at once and a little complex of a read but extremely interesting.<br />you can tell M danielewski put a lot of thought into the plot. aside from the story inself, the book is one of a kind, the way it is printed coinsides with whats happening in the story, sounds weird but you have to see it to understand. you will be reading pages as the text circles like a staircase to oblivion or holding the book in the mirror to read the reverse printing. Great book, original, inspired and thought provoking!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app ever minecraft on the go all they need to do is add more stuff like in the pc version other wise great app
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|This was a lot of words to read, but loved it. It started off not very interesting but it got a lot better.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|As the black box in an aircraft helps the investigators piece together the chain of events, so this book takes the reader on a journey of discovery. This is not your usual crime thriller, but rather a well written narrative, thoroughly enjoyable.
0738212415|5.0|Great book, it teaches you how to draw in 30 days or less. I feel the difference already by the time I got to lessen 15. Very easy and step by step instructions. Buy it or give it as a gift to your child or anybody who says I can not draw.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is  a better version of temple run at a subway station even if you don't like temple run you will find that this is a good game
0345304233|5.0|Great little book with lots of tips and memory shortcuts that makes memorization and remembering much easier than before. Highly recommended. worth every dime. Buy it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best app on my kindle I play it everyday it is so awesome it Is so cool
0810989956|5.0|My son loves it as he is able to write his own stories and use his imagination. Would recommend it to other parents
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|You expect excellence in language from Ford and this did not disappoint in that respect.  If  you like a thoughtful approach, with a gradual expansion of the narrator's awareness you will like this &#34;coming of age&#34; story.  There is more emotion to the depiction of the landscape and its stark character than there is emotionally satisfying resolution, though.  It is a &#34;cool&#34; toned novel, despite its dramatic opening and events.  I liked it, I would recommend it, but I didn't love it.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Loved him on American Idol.  I couldn't wait to get this CD and it was perfect!  I can't wait for the next one.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I don't like getting blown up but the game is addictive.  Works well and at FREE can't beat the price.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written book detailing the preparation to catch &#34;Geronimo&#34; as told from the Operator level. Much more in depth than the sanitized &#34;official&#34; story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't get enough of Downton Abbey!!  And now, I get to watch them all before they are on the air here, great surprise!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|If you text a lot, you need to press very hard to go through the front cover....to much work for me to send a message!
B00181JGI2|5.0|Great movie. Sometimes you eat the b'ar and sometimes... the b'ar eats you! Don't watch if you can't handle strong language.
B005K2YTG4|4.0|Timbuk2 products are always high quality.  I like that I can put my kindle away and be sure it is protected, I wasn't so concerned with getting a case that also fit on the kindle while I was reading.  The only tiny downside to this case is that I am afraid the Velcro holding the case closed will wear out eventually.  I wish there was some kind of clasp to keep it shut.  Overall though, I am so happy with this product.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I loved this book it wasn't have bad after all. I loved it. It was pretty good. Now I want to see the movie of the hunger games
B007BFSYMS|5.0|So far seems to work as advertised. Only thing i would suggest adding is a way to adjust the treble &amp; bass levels. Nothing too fancy like a full equalizer--just a bass control and a treble control.  Otherwise, keep up the good work.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a good game but it doesn't hold my interest for long.  If I were willing to buy the advances I need then it might be different.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The acting is great, costumes are realistic and is a great way to look at life in an earlier time.  Gives us an opportunity to see how society of the wealthy had a responsibility to care for the less fortunate.  not much different that the federal government does today.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I must say the Brits certainly know how to produce better television series than we do in the US.  Well written and well acted.  Amazing how many stories are going on at the same time and each segment is interesting and entertwines in some way with the story as a whole.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|I was 8 when I got my first copy of this album.  I went through an 8-track, Two cassettes, a vinyl copy, a CD, a remastered mp3, and now the RECURRECTED version.  I went through them because it has been 33 years with this album, and I have listened to it 400++ times.  I hear every change that Bob Ezrin has done, and I love it.  I think it sounds fresh, it sounds exciting, and it is another reason to listen to the best damn metal album ever made! OK, the best glam, power pop, hitting some metal, album ever made!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is an excellent product that I use daily.  It is so wonderful to be able to get the weather forecast instantly at your finger tips.  I highly recommend this product.
B001QI0FAA|2.0|It's horrible and does not keep my interest. It's creepy in a very odd, boring way. I didn't like it at all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome this is so much fun. Rio is great keep the updates coming.loooooovvvee it. Make more charachers. Sorry characters. Subway suffers is very addicting have fun with this but watch out for trains!
1451696191|5.0|I just finished \\"Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" and then perused the one star reviews. I feel like I need to now justify my love of this book.<br />Despite the fact that some of the characters may be 'cliche', there are so many valuable truths in this book. And whether you can relate personally to Charlie, I think that almost everyone can relate to the need to find others like yourself, or at least others that accept you and appreciate you for who you are. Not only that, but the book confronts serious issues like sexual and physical abuse as well as the issue of losing your own self in an unhealthy relationship. One of my favorite quotes from the book is from the scene involving Charlie's sister after her parents find out that her boyfriend hit her. She claims (about her boyfriend) \\"He's my whole world.\\" To which her mother responds, \\"Don't ever say that about anyone again, not even me.\\" Even though it's not a very significant part of the story, Chbosky is able to slip in a pertinent truth about life, even if it is not an easy one to swallow.<br />My take away from this book was the importance of wrestling with the darker side of things, no matter how utterly terrifying they are. It is crucial to remain honest with yourself and others, even if honesty means revealing the uglier parts of ourselves. I think struggling with our issues, whether personal or relational, is a great means of developing and changing, and helping others to change too. I think that Charlie's struggle of being a \\"wallflower\\" is probably the greatest perk of being one.
0307943259|5.0|It is a riveting story with plot twists, great narration and made the 900 mile drive seem much shorter. You will like it!1
0374533571|4.0|I am honestly really surprised by the people who said this book was boring, and that it was TORTURE to finish. (Was someone holding a gun to your head to force you to finish it?) I read it in one sitting, and loved it. The whole time I was hoping that the story was not going to resolve itself neatly, because I would have blown a gasket if a book that seemed to focus on the unrelenting reality of unhappy endings ended with a \\"and they lived happily ever after\\". Thankfully, although the book did have resolution, it wasn't necessarily the silver lining Pat was hoping for. I really enjoy books that expose an uncomfortable part of humanity. As a person who is perpetually afraid of becoming 'crazy' like my mother, it was great to see the beauty of 'crazy'. I also really enjoyed that the book wasn't all about the relationship between Pat and Tiffany, as I kind of expected it to be, soley based on the movie preview. Even though I am not a huge football fan, all of the parts about the Eagles wasn't any kind of turn off for me either. I think the book was written with great talent. It made me laugh, and it made me cry, and it made me want to read more great literature, even though after reading the Old Man and the Sea, I will never tough a Hemingway book again.<br />Life most definitely isn't a piece of cake, which is all the more reason that we should appreciate Silver Linings.<br />Also, maybe I should review the movie on it's own review, but I hated it so much, I won't waste my time. Nothing like the book, and I think it 100 percent missed the point of the book.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Best Movie theme in a long time.  The song is a preview to the outstanding movie it is the title song for.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I absolutely love this game. With a little patience its great! TEAM LAVA PLEASE GIVE US KINDLE PLAYERS THE UPDATES!! I wont pay anymore until you do. AWESOME GAME!!!
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love this show. It's funny and sexy. This season is just as good as the previous ones. The dynamics between the two leads starts to change and grow. A definite must for any Nathan Fillion or Stana Katic fan.
1616550414|5.0|I had ordered my copy on Wednesday morning and got it Thursday in the mail! It was shipped perfectly and arrived in great condition. I was shocked at the fast turn around time in receiving this book as well! I loved the book and we had discussed it on a podcast last night. Podcast will be available for download later today here [...]<br /><br />I think they did a great job in creating this masterpiece. I also like how they left some questions unanswered but gave hints such as the ocarina being made from timeshift stones. This is an amazing buy for any fan of Zelda!
0590259385|5.0|I love this book, what can I say! I bought it for my 4 year old twin grandsons for their birthday & they love it! Just as my youngest 2 sons lived it when they were little. The book is a solid, durable hardboard book, which makes it hold up well.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|As much as I enjoyed season one, the season finale was so contrived, poorly written, and frankly, insulting to my intelligence that it downgraded the entire show for me. Season 2 seemed to be much better thought out, from beginning to end. The acting, as always, stupendous. Jessica Lange just get better and better. I really enjoyed it.
0307477479|5.0|I bought this for a gift for family. They had this on their wishlist. As far as I know there have been no issues with it.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I am a vampire fan! I loved all the Twilight Saga books and movies. I can't wait for part 2 to come out on DVD.

B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was a challenge to work with but well worth it, my Grand son loves it, different from his other lego things.
B003ZJ70W4|4.0|Still can't beat the first. Fashion was incredible.  Did enjoy the women's clothes beneath the Burkas.  Should have been set in NYC - part of the charm of Sex and the City - is the City!
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My grand son was so excited, i ordered it late so gave it to him for Christmas, He was happy he could not have waited to put together one at a time!
B004132HZS|5.0|I love this series, my boyfriend introduced it to me and I was hooked! Excellent adaptation of Doyles work and really enjoyable.
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|We like stories based on real people. This was enjoyable to watch and learn about the history of Miss Potter.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a good book because you want to be able to tell you that I want a good books

B007REW8DO|5.0|I had a small problem with the case being broken when this CD arrived, but the manufacture was very polite and prompt in getting the problem resolved.  EXCELLENT CD AND EXCELLENT SERVICE !  Very Happy and Satisfied customer - and now a days that is not easy to find.
B0073U2F12|1.0|This was one of the worst movies of the year. When the setting is the ONLY thing that a movie has going for it, then you know the script has tanked.<br /><br />It may be mildly interesting the first time you see it. It's flaws really show up when you see it a 2nd and 3rd time.<br /><br />Certainly not what I'm looking for for my collection.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The fast-moving multi-facetted plot of Threat Vector shows people with honorable, yet human motives.  A good mixture of good and evil.  No matter what the perceived outcome, the good guys are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, even though they experience fear and the emotions all of us would experience.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages.  Different scenes and progressing levels make it challenging also.<br />I can see why it is so popular.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|IIt is way better than the first one if you injoied the first one you will love this I hope you will to I think it has beter grafics
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|I really enjoyed the soundtrack while watching the movie.  The mixing on this CD is not at all the same as the in theater soundtrack which was a little disappointing.  What you hear in the theater these days is not quite what you hear on the CD.  It lacked definition and a lot of the low end.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Haven't really explored it fully yet, but so far, it's perfect.  I was able to access books in my archive and navigating pages is easy.
0345803485|5.0|loved it and not for the xrated scenes but the overall development of the love story was very good.  Had a hard time putting it down!
B0091THRCU|5.0|I'm very happy with this purchase, the case is made of an excellent material and it fits perfectly on the phone, it gives great protection and it looks nice.
0316069434|5.0|Yes I have read every Harry Bosch book and some are a little better than others, but they are all good action-packed suspenseful reading, and \\"The Black Box\\" is another treasured read. Michael Connelly writes the detective novels like you the reader are right beside him as he's plotting out how to solve a crime, deal with police politics, and be a single dad to a 16 yr-old daughter. I love how his daughter Maddie is incorporated into his latest novels, she makes Harry's character more likeable and rounded.<br /><br />Sometimes the plot seems like TV cop show stuff, but when it's humming on track there's no better detective procedural fiction that comes close to what Connelly writes. It's the realism of the dialogue and the craft of storytelling that Connelly has mastered.<br /><br />Michael McConnohie replacing Len Cariou as audio book reader does a good job capturing Harry's demeanor. 5 star entertainment!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome because it's just a fun game to play when your bored.<br />This game is so awesome.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I LOVE THE SHOW BUT ITS NOT AS GOOD AS BREAKING BAD. THIS SEASON WAS OK IM READY FOR THE NEW ONE.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really enjoyed this two-book series. Colleen Hoover has a way of writting that pulls you into the story and allows you to get to know the characters. I not only loved Layken and Will, but all of the supporting characters as well. Parts of this series will stick with me for a long time. This is a well told story about life -- the good, bad, and confusing things that can happen and how when you are surrounded by the right people, you can make it through. I also enjoyed learning more about poetry slams and the Avett Brothers. I'd highly recommend this series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fabulous - love everything about it! The story, the characters, the clothes, the house, the scenery, the setting - everything is perfect!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good game. Can never put it down after I have started playing it. At first I wasn't very sure on the game but once I got it... I'm glad I did.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I didn't like this book at all, I know its for entertainment only but just felt it was lacking something. Kept reading hoping it<br />would get better but it never did! I'm not kidding!
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I have relished DeMilles' books for years. The complexity of his characters and his stories riveted me to the 600 page books that left me wanting more. The Lions Game was one of the top 3 books I have ever read. The quality of his books since have deminished dramatically. The Panther was tedious & I struggled to finish it. John Corey has become a pathetic, sarcastic egotist. In his opinion, no one but him has the intelligence or patriotism to do the right thing. America is far better than his depiction of our intelligence community. He should reread his old books & find his way bck to his brilliance & the America he once revered.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I just love this movie! Great plot, characters, and battles! I really liked the way that they mangled time travel with the plot. Two thumbs up!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. Especially the first part of it (the second part was a little dull, IMHO). The heroes are absolutely lovely and I enjoyed the Yorkshire speech very much.
B009TO99TG|5.0|Good buy especially for a due hard Coldplay fan. Always in my car playing non stop. Don't waste more time thinking about purchasing it , it's totally worth it.

076115728X|5.0|I love reading this book with my daughter.  She loves all the silly interactive things and I love the message!
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|My favorite of the Uno Dos Tre.  I must have listened to this album repeatedly over the past few days.  Not as good as Dookie and American Idiot, but still a good 3rd place.  I guess that's what &#34;Tre&#34; also means to me.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a wonderful, heartwarming book. I couldn't put it down til I was finished with it. Can't wait to see the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|We can't put it down! We love the zipline and giant monkey chasing you. It's easier to get diamonds too!

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This was the perfect replacement powercord for my Kindle.<br />After my friend lost my cord I thought I would have to spend a lot to replace it. This does the job at a reasonable price!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Amazing book especially after watching the show. Full of mystery I am now reading the second book and I can't wait to see what happens.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This was the best calendar app I could find for syncing my Google calendar into my Original Fire.

And it allows syncing between my ToDo/Tasks lists :)

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Haven't finished it yet but it is great!  Interesting to read about the scientific info and the heavely one, can't wat to finish it.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is a really good game!Gameloft is the best game company for tablets!The only thing I don't like is the time it takes for u to collect the money.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|This a page turner but  so far out there.  Mr. Grisham explained how far-fetched it is but it definitely is an exciting book like all of his other stories.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|This over priced case is both cheaply made and doesn't work with the 4S IPhone properly. The plastic covering covers the sound . No one I called could hear me. DON'T Buy it!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game recommended for all ages for non violent graphics and also an option of violent graphics that are fun for everyone.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like this one, it keeps me busy and occupied for a long time. So many patterns you do not get bored..
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Being able to digitize all those old memories is terrific.  The DB Tech Scanner is a very good little gadget.  It's a bit fiddly getting a good image with negative stripes but slides are a breeze.  The unit's &#34;flip&#34; and &#34;mirror&#34; functions are extremely useful.  For the money this is a very good product.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it. It gives you options. I would recommend it to everyone. I like that when you win the game , it will stack the cards for you. It also automatically moves the cards.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Several weeks ago while previewing the upcoming new CD releases on Amazon I spotted an album that really intrigued me.  It was Emmy Rossum's \\"Sentimental Journey\\".  The concept behind this disc was that each of the 12 tunes would reflect either lyrically or emotionally one of the twelve months of the year.  Frankly, I had never heard of Emmy Rossum so I had absolutely no idea what to expect.  This was no aging rock star trying to hang on for dear life.  Rather, this appeared to be a gifted young singer who had a passion for this kind of music.  Why else would a major label like Warner Brothers release a disc like this?  So I took the plunge and ordered it.  After savoring \\"Sentimental Journey\\" multiple times last evening you can count me an instant fan.  This is a truly remarkable recording.<br /><br />Although I was familiar with The Andrews Sisters very fine version of \\"(I'll Be With You In) Apple Blossom Time I had no idea that this tune first hit the charts way back in 1920.  Emmy Rossum has a special place in her heart for this one as her mom used to sing it her as a bedtime lullaby when she was a young child.  Emmy does an outstanding job with this number and makes it all her own.  Perhaps my favorite number on the album is \\"The Object of My Affection\\" which was a #1 hit for The Boswell Sisters in 1935.  Emmy's rendition of this classic tune just might be the best version of this song that I have ever heard.  Other selections included from the Great American Songbook are Bessie Smith's Depression-era standard \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\\", \\"All I Do Is Dream of You\\" from the mid 1930's,  a really cool arrangement of \\"I'm Looking Over A Four Leaf Clover\\" and of course the title track \\"Sentimental Journey\\".  Damn good stuff!  Other notable songs on the album are \\"Many Tears Ago\\" which was a huge hit for Connie Francis in 1960 and a very different take on Johnny Mercer's \\"Summer Wind\\" which had been a hit for Sinatra in 1966.  I thought Emmy's version was outstanding!<br /><br />While I was playing \\"Sentimental Journey\\" my wife came into the room and wanted to know who the singer was.  When I said Emmy Rossum she was as clueless as I was.  Since we don't go to the movies very much we had no idea that she has appeared in a number of feature films including \\"Songcatcher\\" and \\"Phantom of the Opera\\".  We were also unaware that Emmy had been in the Children's Chorus of New York's famed Metropolitan Opera.  I was also quite surprised to discover that \\"Sentimental Journey\\" was only the second album recorded by this incredibly gifted young vocalist and her first in nearly seven years.  I mentioned to my wife that as far as I was concerned Emmy Rossum was as talented as a young Barbra Streisand....perhaps even better!<br /><br />On her website Emmy Rossum talked about her new album.  She explained:  \\"I wanted the album to have an old fashioned authenticity, which is why I got a bunch of musicians together, put them in one room and said `Okay, we're going to do this in three days,'\\" she says \\"I love the sound of 1920's records, like the Bessie Smith I grew up listening to, which is why we mastered to tape.  We were flying by the seat of our pants but it all worked out.\\"  It sure did!  Emmy Rossum is very wise for her 26 years.  By the way those musicians were outstanding, most notably Giulio Carmassi on the piano.  For me, listening to \\"Sentimental Journey\\" proved to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  This is one disc I will enjoy again and again.  And when the 2013 Grammy's are handed out I fully expect \\"Sentimental Journey\\" to be among the winners.  Outstanding in every way!  Very highly recommended!on was outstanding!<br /><br />While I was playing \\"Sentimental Journey\\" my wife came into the room and wanted to know who the singer was.

We were flying by the seat of our pants but it all worked out.\\"  It sure did!  Emmy Rossum is very wise for her 26 years.  By the way those musicians were outstanding, most notably Giulio Carmassi on the piano.  For me, listening to \\"Sentimental Journey\\" proved to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  This is one disc I will enjoy again and again.  And when the 2013 Grammy's are handed out I fully expect \\"Sentimental Journey\\" to be among the winners.  Outstanding in every way!  Very highly recommended!

0765325950|5.0|I had been looking forward to this book for a very long time...and dreading it too. I really didn't want to say goodbye to good friends. Memory of Light exceeded my expectations and ended the only way it could and should. I think that Robert Jordan had a wonderful talent for writing and proved it all through the series. Brandon Sanderson had big shoes to fill...but fill them he did!!  Thank you Robert Jordan and thank you Brandon Sanderson for taking me with you through the wheel of time...
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is a great game for a family. It gets you to really think and draw! We love it and our whole family is addicted!

B00AIA89HS|5.0|Having just received my psychical CD in the mail and taking my first listen through the tracks on headphones, I can say that already by Track 5 Before The Fights Ends You, this is both classic and new Hatebreed with all I have come to love and bleed my ears for since the early days.  It is totally a great album, and I haven't even finished my first listen yet.<br /><br />Yes, with an average song of 3 minutes there are no long super epic 5 minute epic metal riffs going on, but with the energy of an average Hatebreed song being twice any other band, I think the three minute blast of each track is just about right.<br /><br />This CD will get played by me every day for years. It's awesome sounding, differential tracks, rifftastic rhythms, and lyrically acoustic Hatebreed mastery.  As I hoped and expected from their 2013 release.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run two is absolutely amazing...it brings new things to do that are quite fun. It makes you stay on the edge of your seat and makes you have a lot of suspense..
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is the most beautiful, magical and sensual book I have ever read, and I've read a lot of books! I find I reread passages over and over. The descriptions of colors, smells, fabrics are stunning.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had fallen behind on catching the Downton episodes on PBS, so I streamed the missed episodes on Amazon HD streaming.<br />Both the video and audio quality were excellent.  Highly recommended.
0765325950|5.0|This book was GREAT!!! The pre-order worked wonderfully and the book came in perfect condition. It is a GREAT ending to the best series I have read in a long time. R.I.P Robert Jordan, thank you for the great series.

B009RH973I|4.0|I have purchased another Marware Kindle case before and have been very pleased. With the hard shell this case definitely protects my Kindle Fire HD! The connection crease from the hard cover to the front cover is slightly flimsy. Possibly it is made this way for additional flexibility, but other than that it is a very nice case and I'm very satisfied. The reason I'm giving it a 4 star rating is due to the price. As others stated when I read the reviews...it is definitely over priced. Marware is a good brand, but they need to be a little more practical on the price.
B002SRQ214|5.0|muy buen producto todo fue entregado como las caracteristicas  todo como lo solicite y atiempo selo agradesco de parte del bendedor

B001B3MCQK|5.0|Saw the movie, loved the story and the music, bought the CD, played the CD several times, now the music is in my head and won't go away.  At random moments the tunes and the words just seem to reappear.  Its a tribute to the quality of the music that after just a few playings I can remember so much.  This is rapidly becoming one of my go to albums.  Like the very best music it has layers that unfold over time. Why it took a movie to rediscover it amazes me.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Was a gift for my husband.  He loves it and says so far great quality!  He has only watched episode one.
1741797802|4.0|Good book - my only issue is that India is so large and I was only going to two cities. I wish I had bought the regional book! This one is giant and gives a great overview of the country. Really liked the pull out map of Delhi too!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  What a heartfelt book.  Wish my daughter was a bit older to read it.  At times I forgot how old Holder actually was because of his intensity.  A MUST READ!!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It was nice to have this series finish but the Third book was lacking in so many ways. Yes it explained a lot but this series could have been incredible.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is just like temple run and it is really fun and I have to say temple run is pretty fun two and try temple run 2 it is way better than the first but subway surfers is really fun you unlock and buy people and buy new boards too! Really think it is a good game and trust me it is great unlike mindcraft black ops it is a wast of money I am with the raters because it says it is only pictures of a minecraft mod.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really liked the story is what keep me interested I never wanted it to end i could not wait to get to the last book

B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's a generally well written, imaginative emotional piece of entertainment. I'm not sure I agree with the choice of target audience, but Collins begs an interesting question regarding just how different her dark little tale is from present reality across today's world.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This one of the best apps that I have. Great graphics and its not super easy but not impossible. The setting changes every mounth so it doesn't get boring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best game I played on my tablet if I have nothing to play I play sub way surfers
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great game. really enjoying it. really good graphics for a free game. if you love horses i recommend this game.
B00935KWWO|4.0|I got this app among others to find something that would run Twitter on Kindle to my liking. This one is probably the best- conversations are easily summoned without having to load a new page, and it has an in-app browser for links. The main drawbacks, and the reason for the 4 stars, are the somewhat intrusive ads and the fact that as far as i can tell you cant directly download images from the app or its browser.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|I saw Hansel and Gretel the day it came out because let's face it Gemma Atherton is beautiful and Jeremy Renner kicks all kinds of ass. Despite those two really big positives I went into watching it with very low expectations, I've just seen too many horror comedies over the years to not remember that they often don't work. First and foremost this film is fun to watch, but for me it seemed really unbalanced and never really got into a good rhythm because it jumped back and forth from irreverent horror comedy to action adventure to action horror with no rhyme or reason. This led to the fact that this film has a lot of scenes I liked, but the overall story to me seemed slow in developing because I just wasn't that involved in the characters lives. The film however does have a truly beautiful production design and from the make up effects of the witches to the strange almost steampunk inspired fire arms you can really see the money that was sunk into the film. I have seen a few people compare this film to Van Hielsing and while that comparison is fair this film takes itself far less seriously and is a great deal more fun to watch.<br /><br />I would only rent this one, it's fun to watch the first time, but I doubt you will want to have it in your collection for repeat viewings.
B009YU62H2|4.0|I readily admit I was probably hoping for something along the lines of a mix of Down on the Upside and Superunknown and so the new release didn't grab me right away, but it's only taken a couple of passes through all of it to settle in and enjoy. Of course it's not going to be the same stuff! Silly to even think so. It's got its own rawness, though it is definitely polished. It has plenty of power and can handily annoy your neighbors should you wish to do so. The pipes you know are in no way diminished and the instruments are just as active and deftly handled. My own personal taste (and that's what a review is about, to some extent) would have liked to hear an acoustic tune or two - I think the band has more agility to show off and I have no doubt they've got some great tunes already written as acoustic performances. Still, this is satisfying.
B008220BLG|5.0|It has been a long time since I have gone into a film with the kind of high expectations I had for this film. I have read the book and I absolutely love it, so it's safe to say I was setting myself up for disappointment and I will admit there are a few subplots from the book I would have loved to see in this film and got cut. The 70% or so of the book that made it into this movie is done perfectly it is a poignant coming of age film, a heartfelt romantic comedy and a Zombie horror movie all wrapped up in one. I cannot recommend this movie enough, it's worth it to just to see Rob Cordry's amazing portrayal as &#34;M&#34; it was amazing.<br /><br />This one is worth owning because you will want to watch it again and again.
1439152799|5.0|I have not read this book yet, Most of Katy's books like the Secert Garden are really good. I bought it as a used book and it came fast and is in like new.
B0090SI4HO|4.0|When I first saw the ads for &#34;The Last Stand&#34; I was naturally fearful that it would be every bit as bad as that first trailer made it appear. However I'm glad I didn't let that first trailer keep me from seeing the film. &#34;The Last Stand&#34; is a silly action filled romp with all the campy dialogue that made so many Arnold movies in the 80's so much more than simple action films. Above all else the film is fun to watch. Arnold gives us a more introspective character than I have ever seen him play before, but his performance as this aged and burnt out Sheriff is just as easy to root for as the more swashbuckling characters he played so often in his youth. He is joined by a strong supporting cast including two villains both of whom are just crying out for pain which Arnold is more than happy to supply.<br /><br />If you're an Arnold fan this one is a keeper and for everyone else give this movie a rent some night when you feel like an action movie.
1594203334|5.0|The book is certainly a fun read. I would not take it seriously, as it is not a parenting book, though it does have interesting observations worth considering. I would categorize it as travel notes, well written with good humour.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its amazing I love it...everyone should have it. it works perfect it has not shown any problems as of now.
B006ZCWTV0|4.0|Just one of the CD's I'm buying now that I've &#34;discovered&#34; the Boss.  This is a very relevant and timely CD collection as it deals with the econ meltdown of the last few years.  Really good stuff.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Downloaded this onto my Kindle Fire/Rooted/Android tablet, use it every morning. Lots of useful features like the usage of math to snooze the alarm.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|Just getting into Springsteen, and this is one of the CD's I got to get to know him better.  It's a great CD.

B000002BFL|3.0|Believe it or not, I'm 61 and just getting into the Boss.  I bought this CD because his live version of the title song is so great; it's a little different on the original here.  And I'm not thrilled with the rest of the songs.  Hey, you take a risk when you order CD's &#34;blind&#34; like this.  Still love the guy.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Well who doesn't love this little lady? . My daughter was thrilled with the CD.Shes a happy camper  Came quickly and effienetly
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Paul Simon still sounds great, and he has one of the best versions of Sounds of Silence I've ever heard on this live CD.  Love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This was amazing but I liked invisibility in tr1 lol lol lol l l l l ll lol lol lol
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I highly recommend Sylvia Day's crossfire series.  The first two books in the series are the first books I have devoured in a long time.  I was sneaking peaks at the book every free second I had.  The book is sexy, the story is interesting, and the characters are just twisted enough to sustain multiple books.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|This little Panda keeps my 2 year old grandson busy gardening ... he loves it. He's so proud when he gets to put his produce in the basket for the animals.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Normally i dont like books. Never been able to sit down and just reed a book.<br /><br />But after seeing the series i television, i though, what the heck, lets try.<br /><br />And i am very glad i did! Great book. Amazing world, great characters. and a great story line, ill defently read the rest of the series.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Best game ever for my 2 year old grandson! He can't get enough of it. He loves making all the animals feel better. Need more games like this!!!!
0345522478|4.0|I don't review a lot of books but wanted to add one for this book.  I will say I did enjoy this book.  The characters were interesting.  The interaction between characters was engaging.  The story line was good.  But in the end, I didn't feel the desire to run out and buy the next book.  In the end, I went to the library and put a hold on HEXED to see where the story goes.<br /><br />Here is why.<br /><br />Everything was to easy for the hero.  I guess I enjoy a little more depth to the fights.  I enjoy reading R.A. Salvatore books that really detail a fight scene.  I also like Jim Butcher's Dresden character who keeps fighting no matter how beat up he is.  The hero here, Atticus, has good characteristics that kept me engaged.  So I am going to keep reading to see if the story matures.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to adults, maybe teenagers.  I think this is a good book for teenagers, except for the sex that is hinted at.  Nothing to detailed, but enough that I wouldn't steer my 13 yr old towards this book.<br /><br />Hope this helps anyone considering this book.
B009O5CLZY|3.0|Not bad for a simple game - can't beat the price. Got old kind of quick though - not sure how far any of them got in the levels..
B00A4TKDKY|2.0|If you're into air guitar and a fan of Rock you'll like this cd...I did not like this cd with the exception of a couple of songs. Absolutely not what I expected and I went to buddy guy's concerts in the early 70s and late 60s. I thought he had evolved a bit. I was expecting to hear the BLUES, not rock.
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|very difficult to progress through the game. Though the idea and realization is above average, the *fun* factor is just not there. uninstall.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham's latest is one of his best. I can already see a movie in the making. Great plot with twists and turns keep you not wanting to put the book down.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Most movies get the 'laugh out loud funny' label. But they aren't. This movie is actually laugh out loud funny, even when you're watching it by yourself on a late night bus trip to NYC. Seriously, watch it. I rented it 4 times before I was smart enough to purchase the thing. Love it.

B002M87V0A|5.0|Things can't get better!  Colors are vibrant!  Music is awesome on my 5.1 Surround.  It's like experiencing it for the first time at the cinema.  And what an incredible price!  Perfect!
B0091LS07E|3.0|I am a big Alicia Keys fan but was disappointed with this CD. Her sound is different for most songs. Love the Girl on Fire single but not much else.
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|I use this WD 2go app as a Cloud storage.  I have a large external WD Live Duo (6tb) that I am using for cloud storage.  Cloud storage can add up.  It also will allow me access to other files on my DUO.  I use this with my Kindle and Apple IPAD.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|~Rae~<br />I am a huge Mitch Albom fan I have read pretty much everything he has written. I really enjoyed this book. If you have a problem or don't like jumping between stories or characters then this might not be the book for you. I read this book in one night it was hard to pour down.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|one word for this game awsome<br />and u get very addicted to it it it it it it it it it it
B000NTHT6G|5.0|And I don't play favorites.  It's clever, funny, and makes you feel.  I watch it when I'm down, when I'm up and I also love that it's on the on-line so I don't have to carry it around with me everywhere...
0547569653|4.0|Some runners do 5K races, others attempt half-marathons and marathons, but there is another breed of runner who go further much further.<br />How much more?<br />Six-and-a-half full marathons, back to back, in a single day. That's what ultrarunner Scott Jurek did, running a staggering 165 miles in 24 hours to set a US record.<br />And if you've ever wondered what it takes to run 135 miles across Death Valley in tempartures that don't drop below 100F even in the middle of the night, then Jurek would be a good person to ask. He's done it twice.<br />Jurek is one of the world's best known ultra-runners, due in a large part to his appearance in the best-selling 2009 running book `Born to Run'.<br />But he had made a name for himself long before his `Born to Run' fame, being an established champion in the ultra-marathon scene and regarded as the best in the US. That in turn led to an invitation to pit himself against the long distance prowess of the legendary Tarahumara Indians of Mexico's Copper Canyon, as chronicled in Christopher McDougall's `Born to Run'.<br />Jurek has now written his own book about his unlikely path to ultrarunning greatness. In `Eat & Run' he traces his route from his youth, where he originally competed as a skier, to his emergence as one of the greatest ultra-distance runners of the 1990s and 2000s.<br />\\"I ran, and kept running, because I had learned that once you started something you didn't quit, because in life, much like in an ultra-marathon, you have to keep pressing forward,\\" writes Jurek.<br />The 135-mile race across California's Death Valley, the Badwater UltraMarathon, has been labelled `the world's toughest foot race'. When Jurek took up the challenge in 2005 he was already a darling of ultra distance running. But even his impressive string of victories in 100-mile races across mountains and canyons had not tested him to the limit the way Death Valley would.<br />Jurek's experience in the Badwater race is a major hook for `Eat & Run',however there is much more. It traces the Minnesota-born runner's life in fascinating detail, from his childhood troubles to his immersion into the oft overlooked world of ultrarunning and his celebrated races with the Tarahumaru runners and beyond.<br />Along the way Jurek became a committed vegan. The `eat' in the book's title refers to the vegan recipes that tail each chapter. Throughout the book Jurek often refers to the meals, and how he discovered them and used them as a competitor.<br />`Eat & Run' is a fascinating read that moves along quickly and reveals what makes an ultra-runner tick, and what drives them to keep running far beyond the limits of most others.<br />It also contains many tips for runners, whatever their standard, interested in learning how to improve style and form, how to run faster and longer, and how to stay healthy -- whether they want to become vegans or not.<br />Jurek and his co-writer Steve Friedman have done a fine job in making `Eat & Run' an easy to read, compelling page-turner that is likely to appeal to seasoned runners, beginners and even non-runners.
B002LLOZYI|5.0|I totally understand why this show has won awards.  The story line is great, the acting is super and it is so addicting.  My husband and I both love it.
B0098460O4|5.0|At 67 years old, suffering through the music of today, I thought it was impossible for me to be transported to ecstasy, but Jonathan and Charlotte Together, you have done it!!  I bought this recording, that I have waited long enough to purchase, on my husband's Amazon Prime Account, and I am not disappointed.  I think I would have walked to obtain it.  I can't wait for the next one.  Except for tinny recordings, I am not old enough to have heard the original Caruso - Really! - but, Jonathan, he would stand up and cheer to hear your magnificent voice.  And your charm, the little enough that I have seen you, is simply magic.  Charlotte, the bell-like quality of your voice is a perfect foil for Jonathan's rich tones.  You are simply unforgettable together.  I hope you both will remain unspoiled and natural.  It is what makes the two of you so bellissimo!! With love, Jaye, from Virginia, a forever fan.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It isn't just about sex. It is about love, loyalty, control and growing. A very good novel. I laughed and cried, and look forward to reading the next one in the series. I say don't read it if you are not completely comfortable with sex, and everything that goes with it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this app a lot! it is so fun to play on my kindle fire. I am still waiting for the next update, but it is still in my favorites and in am almost always playing it. best game ever! I think everyone would like it.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|This is one very dark movie.  I'm not sure whether I prefer the &#34;happy ending&#34; version.  But it is a classic.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|TERENCE MALICK MADE ME CRY<br />My girlfriend cried on my arms when we watched this. I had to wipe my arms with a (paper) towel.<br /><br />Watch this movie if:<br />1. You love movies.<br />2. You've ever lived in the South while a boy from ages 11-13<br />3. You are willing to feel emotion<br />4. You like making your girl/boy-friend cry.
B004UID2LC|5.0|So easy to use. Love it. Would recommend it to any who is looking to download any sort of video off YouTube.
0812993292|3.0|Not a book I really enjoyed as one could fathom how the journey would end long before I reached the last page.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A little predictable and redundant but wildly entertaining. A very quick read. Lost some Kindle bookmarks while reading which made interrupted reading Frustrating !!
0316228532|3.0|Takes too long to 'get into the story' with long drawn out introductions to the characters. Perhaps I'd have enjoyed IF I was a Harry Potter fan and 50 years younger.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I have yet to find a Shinedown CD that I have not loved.  They manage to keep their sound, you definitely know it's them, however it's not repetative.  The writing is incredible.  5 stars easy!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very entertaining once I tried it I almost couldn't put it down. I think it's way better then temple run. I love the boards.
B004DM0UII|4.0|It connects you to streaming websites.  I like Pandora for finding new artists, but you can get similar results from the stations here.  Reminds me of the &quot;radio&quot; tab inWindows Media Player 10.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is a really good take why I think it a good game because if want to play a lot of time and when you get mad you can play again and when you got money you can go to the store with the coins
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book was one of the most interesting books i have read in a while. I read it while flying to California, i forgot my fear of flying so a big \\"Thank You\\" for that. The story was very well written with a great sense of humour and honesty, while keeping you interested and wondering what was going to happen next.<br />Its going to be hard to start another book as this one was so good.
1616890835|4.0|He LOVED it! Said it was the one gift he really wanted this year. The book is very well designed and has tons of great photos.
B008476HBM|5.0|Well I'll tell you that at first I could not understand what they were saying but I got the hang of it. This is my new favorite book. I Love Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, or shall I say Elizabeth Darcy. I recommend this to people  who like a good romance blindness and you got to be able to understand the language in which the book is written in. Then after or before you should watch the movie or/and the short tv show of pride and prejudice.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I have always loved the theatrical version of Hugo's book and felt it was time to read his masterpiece. It is not light reading , many French personalities of the time and words no longer in common usage. It is only slightly similar to the theatrical version initially. For example the first sereral chapters are devoted to the Bishop I.e. the owner of the two candlesticks. But such a rich classic is well with the read.
B0050R0YB8|3.0|The item was exactly as described and in good condition.  I have done other large LEGO kits and must admit that I am very disappointed in this model.  It lacks detail and workmanship.  It does not stack up to previous earlier large LEGO kits.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|The movie was not good theatrically.  But the renting process was wonderful. The video quality and Streaming session was awesome.  No glitches.
B008476HBM|5.0|I first fell in love with the story after watching the movie. The book is so much better, it was all I hoped for and more.
B004GYY714|2.0|It will stream podcasts but that's about it, every time I tried to bookmark anything it would never actually do it.  Extremely buggy, uninstalled.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What a fun little game. It starts off simple and then becomes more involved. A great way to keep you mind sharp. Very addictive too.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Jojo Moyes was new to me, but the book took a grip nome so I couldn't let it go. I had to look her up and buy another book by her, and I was not diissapointed!
B000002LQQ|5.0|I used to have the cassette (remember those)of this album when growing up. It was one of my favorites so I bought the CD out of nostalgia. On Every Street has a a mix of some of the band's best songs and flows nicely from one track to the next.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|A relatively short, absorbing story of an actual heinous crime and better way to spend a Winter afternoon than shoveling snow.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game  surfers is very very fun and its very addictive but now that they have the world tour i think its even more fun because every month your in a new place. Every time i have my tablet my friend says can i play sub surfers she drives me crazy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If you are a fan of Catcher in the Rye or Perks of Being a Wallflower, then this book is a must read.  I couldn't put it down and for a book about cancer, it was extremely funny, honest and entertaining (and of course sad as well).
B00062IVKS|5.0|This movie is pure brilliance. The acting. The cinematography. The fight sequences. Martin Scorsese is genius. He can do no wrong in my eyes.
B00000IQCA|5.0|Response time was fine.Everything was as promised.I like the film and was able to enjoy it.Thanks very much.It is good.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|The Sessions is a deeply moving and poignant statement about vulnerability and having, in D.H. Lawrence's words, &#34;the courage of one's tenderness.&#34;  The acting is superb.
B000W91RUG|5.0|More of Sheldon, Raj, and the gang! I got into this series late in the fourth season and love that I could catch up on old ones back to back without commercials!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Very violent. Plot centers around Bruce Willis characters desire to murder a child in order to prevent him from growing up to become the murderer of his wife. Along the way he does kill the wrong child ( very disturbing).<br /><br />Listen up Hollywood - time travel- yes.  Child murder - No!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|More of Sheldon, Raj, and the gang! I got into this series late in the fourth season and love that I could catch up on old ones back to back without commercials!
B0050SYS5A|5.0|This is what everyone with a small room needs.  Before we got the Zoom, we practically had to stand against the wall to get the Xbox to see us.  Now we can stand much closer and actually use a full range of motions and the Xbox picks it all up.  Great product.  I highly recommend it.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|Funny movie great entertainment.  One of those 'kids' movies that has appeal for adults. Rhea Perlman and Danny DaVito are great!
0757302661|5.0|My midwife recommended this book to me, during my second pregnancy.  I'd had a long, arduous and painful labor with my first baby.  I read the book, but didn't really have time to \\"practice\\" the techniques described between work and family life.  Even if I tried, I found my pregnant self falling asleep.  I went into my birth as quite a skeptic.  I didn't know if this book would work.<br /><br />Fast forward to labor: Things start slow and calm, but as soon as I start feeling some pressure, particularly back labor, I begin to utilize some of the techniques in this book.  Mostly I used visualization and relaxing every muscle in my body.  In between contractions, I quite often dozed off or just continued resting, in my calm state.<br /><br />When I got to the hospital, I found out I was 7 centimeters dilated, which brought tears of joy to my eyes because I was feeling no pain.  When a contraction would come, I'd sink back into mental and physical relaxation.  (Oh, and I never got into the terminology of the book, i.e. contractions are called waves.  I just called 'em contractions.)  My labor was amazing and so beautiful and peaceful!<br /><br />My labor continued on this way, until the last 5 minutes, when I actually gave birth and was in pain then.  But, with no meds, a waterbirth, posterior baby (sunny side up and back labor), baby born in the caul and caught by me, that's a pretty cool thing.  So, after only 5 minutes of pain, I'd say I recommend this book! :)
0061537969|5.0|I laughed and I cried. If you have a dog in your life you will love this book. It will change the way you think about your best furry friend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is a tale of survival. There is a motion picture quality in the storytelling and in the acting. The characters are far from stagnant. They are complex and ever changing. Some have grown stronger in their humanity, some have reinforced their desire to survive and some have become harder, more pragmatic. And nothing is certain. By season 3, you have your favorites and yet, you never know who will be the next victim--either moral or physical. It is heartbreaking and addicting.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This little backup battery charges quickly and provides plenty of power output to quickly charge your device in case you run out of battery, I haven't had a chance to really put it to the test and see how many times it could charge my iPhone 5 or other devices, but based on the product description and other reviews I was willing to buy this over any other similarly priced backup. Size: I was pleasantly surprised by how small the thing is, it can easily be carried in a jacket pocket or backpack pocket or just be put out of the way somewhere without taking up any space (I keep mine in the glove box). It does not lose power when idle either, every time I check the battery it's still completely full which is nice because I don't have to remember to charge it and then put it back in my car etc. Overall, I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|if you thought temple run was awesome, then you haven't seen anything yet. you will love this game no matter who you are. I would definitely recommend getting this app. it is so addicting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008BI1KAW|3.0|The characters are hard to relate too, however they are interesting throughout. This book was good but did not leave me wanting more, only content with its outcome. That might have been what Fitzgerald wanted though.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is awesome. It's not all about sex. It has suspense and many other great story lines like marriage and starting a family
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazing, I find myself trying to get more characters and coins every day. plus when it's on a world tour I try to get one character from each stop. Tony from NYC, Carmen from Rio, this game is perfect for all ages!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is ace, reminds me of being a kid. Love it! I would play more games similar to this.
B002ZG99IG|4.0|My Daughter Goes To Collage And Said That Would Be Scary If she Had a Room Mate Like That i said That Dont Happen To Alot Of People
B004SIIBGU|5.0|What more can I say, besides its e-bay! I love e-bay, just like I love amazon. I like shopping online! :)
B00000JLWW|5.0|Very Very Very Very Very Good Movie i Love It I Can Watch It All The Time It Makes Me Cry But Still Love The Movie.......
B00A757EFW|4.0|This was great, except i'm a little out of practice... lol I need to work on it more. but I am a sucker for old fashioned pac-man!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Love being able to know more about that hard to find person, use this on all devices. Encyclopedia at fingertips
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great game, but gets pretty  laggy at times on android and OS.  Definitely lives up to the predecessor though.  Graphics and art in general are much better than the fist Temple run. Great job Imangi.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I always stay current with what everyone else is doing. Just before bed or the middle of the day. Like to be informed.
B008M721MS|5.0|It's the highest and Skype does deserve the highest. I would recommend it to everyone who needs a proper means of communication.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Yeah I know all you other people who live on their computer figured this out LONG ago...but I have just really started tapping into this social media. So far it has been fun & exciting. I can see where you could be sucked in.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|A bit cliche, much like Castle the writer on the TV show. All in all though, a great mystery read with a little feisty romance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun and addictive game and the theme of the game even changes this game is the best in the world
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|great game.  I don't get addicted very easily. But this one got me.  I love trying to beat my previous high score.
1569242739|5.0|I've only made a few of the recipes from this book, but they have all been fantastic. & not vegan-fantastic but this-is-so-not-vegan fantastic.<br /><br />I'm no longer vegan, but prefer baking without eggs so I don't have to worry about eating the batter, & raw eggs are pretty messy to work with compared to the alternatives. This book contains info on the hows & whys of vegan baking in the beginning, so a mad scientist like myself can feel free to experiment & substitute ingredients without much fear of failure.<br /><br />Anyways, I have the kindle version & think the format could use some improvements for cookbooks, but that is not the fault of this title.
B00APJLFEG|2.0|I really wanted to like this (so that I would have another 3D movie in my collection). It started off interesting, but quickly devolved into fart jokes, puerile script tailored to kids, and blah character design. (The design of the teenage boy was awful - he looked like a generic blob for most of the movie (until his hair was restored to normal) - and the Count himself looked pretty blah, too. The bat-daughter was cute, though.)<br /><br />All that aside, the dialogue was, for the most part, terrible (for adults, anyway). Some animated features, like Shrek and Toy Story, successfully walk the line to make it entertaining for adults as well; this one doesn't succeed. The humor and script are for kids. If this is your main concern, this movie may keep them entertained. Although you will have to explain that humans killed the Count's wife.<br /><br />There are some funny bits, like the Count's boring party games, or The Fly's translation of Igor.<br /><br />Some of the action gags are too fast to see. Zip-zip-zip and it's over.<br /><br />The messages, for what it's worth: 1. Let your kid live their lives however they want. 2. Loud music is more fun. Old music is boring. 3. Today, the world is safer for monsters - we love monsters rather than want to kill them. (Actually kind of touching.)<br /><br />Overall, it was so disappointing I made sure to return it to Redbox the next day, even though it was raining hard. I don't think it was worth the $1.29 rental. And I'm sure not buying it. But, again, if it entertains your kids, you may find it worthwhile.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This so affirmed my personality as an introvert, and it echoed my own frustration at having to &#34;be&#34; extroverted in the world and in my career to be considered successful. I never quite pulled that off.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Yes!!! Everything I could hope for in a good series.  This finale did not disappoint.  I didn't want it to end. I stayed up late for the last 12 or so nights getting through all the books, but no complaints.  Highly recommended.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I am so moved by this album that I want to pass it on to my children.  Rodriquez is timelessly thought provoking.  His poetry and music articulate unspoken angst and passion.
B005LAIGZU|4.0|I'm not a seal but can believe that this movie is the closest to how the operate in theater.  Pretty basic plot but the details are great
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I have rewritten this review over and over trying to share with my words the experiene of this album.  Rodriquez crafted an album of immense complexity with an economy of words and melody. After our first listening to Cold Fact, my husband and I fell silent.  We had no words to express this album's impact.  I am so pleased that we could purchase this great work.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is so incredible I can't say enough about it. If anyone has any questions in their heart about death and dying, this would be a tremendous book to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't seen the movie, so I decided to read the book. I am so glad I did. The book has a great narrative and point of view. I started out slow, but found that I couldn't put it down. I am ready for the next book.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|What makes this book so relevant and believable is the spot on and engaging way the problems of a fictitious IT group within a failing company ballooned out of control. If you have worked in IT you will be immediately identifying the characters in the story with people in your organization.<br /><br />However, the narrative is of course just a pedagogical device. At the heart, the book is an ambitious attempt to describe and socialize new methods for dealing with the crushing demands of IT and the human elements of the constant demoralizing stress. Envisioning IT work in a mass production model, lessons learned in factories are applied to technology work, with (according to the narrative) positive results.<br /><br />I am looking forward to discussing this book with my peers and management, all of whom have had me pestering them to get a copy. The first part of solving a problem is recognizing you have one, and this book helps do that and more.
B00992CF6W|1.0|they are looking into the issue, but it does not work on my son's ZTE Merit.  Hope to have it resolved soon!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it ...it does get a little slow but it's fun. the horses are very life like.... and I do love that you can have unicorn horses if you love horses you will enjoy this App.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I am a Downton Abbey junkie.  The story, the scenery, the costumes--it's so nice to get lost in the early 1900s.  I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't watched yet, so no more details.  This is a series that I will definitely keep, to watch again and again.
B000YDAYCW|5.0|I love the boots but I normally wear a size 9.5 or 10 and I returned the first two pairs I got because they were far too big. I ended up with a size 8.5 and I still feel like they might be a little bit big but I put some Orthotic insoles in them and they fit nicely
B00992CF6W|4.0|It an awesome app but the creative should be more like the one on the pc....(w/ the nether, commands, TNT you can actually blow up, and you should be able to use furnaces, crafting tables, and the nether core all on creative......)
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|&quot;it never workes&quot;  when I logged on it failed to trun on. so its the worst game ever. so don't buy it.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Greate book.  I've said everything I need to say in my other ratings, I do however wish to thank Kindle for having them and selling them in this form.  It makes it very convienient for me to be able in my spare time to sit down and tap on my Kindle Fire, and be able to read without picking up heavy books.  For those with arthritis, the Kindle is a great way to catch up on your reading, Thanx.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This cover is perfect for my child. Bright and colorful while doing an excellent job of protecting the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;
B00280LYIC|5.0|The first book of the Percy Jackson series.  The movie did not do it credit.  Percy is accused of stealing Zuse's Lightning bolt, and has to travle to Hades in order to retrieve it.  He has all kinds of dangerous adventures on the way with Him, Grover(a satyr) and Annabeth( daughter of Athena).  Of course, Percy is the son of Posiden.  Good read. Thanx.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I saw the movie and wanted the soundtrack because I enjoyed the music. Nothing else to say about this. Sorry
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Of the many games and apps, this one is by far the most enjoyable and surprisingly mind bending. If you just feel like playing for a short while or an hour or so, you still get full enjoyment. The graphics are outstanding and the scene changes are eye popping. The game is easy to figure out, but still unbelievably challenging. Get it before they run out! Kudos to the game designers for presenting us with something worth purchasing. This blows away the competition, period.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I had never read this book until I downloaded it for free on Kindle.  Wow!  How did I ever miss this one?  In my youth I read Tolkein, Burroughs, Howard, and many others, but, somehow I never got around to reading Treasure Island.  Not only is this one of the great pirate tales, it is also THE buried treasure book, and, one of the truly great adventure stories of all time.  While there are many that will find fault with some aspects of the story, all in all, I would suggest that all would-be writers desiring to tell a tale of adventure should take the time to reread this tale before they begin their labors.  I should say that having done so, the bulk of them would recognize how far short their own efforts fall.  Technically; the book is extremely well written, the plot moves along at a brisk pace, the characters are well drawn, and the dialog sparkles.  There is plenty of action, adventure, and suspense, all of it told in a crystal clear prose that wastes not a word.  In a nutshell this may indeed be one of the greatest tales of adventure ever told.<br /><br />Although it has traditionally been perceived as a story for younger readers, having just read it at middle age, I believe that you shouldn't consider this a children's tale.  Long John Silver is as darkly evil a character as ever appeared in print; he seduces men with a ready confidentiality, warm, friendly, knowing banter, and then cold-bloodedly murders them when their back is turned.  He suffers no scruples, knows nothing of mercy, and sells anyone at anytime to the other side if he thinks it will profit him.  I think Long John Silver would have done well as a Wall Street corporate raider.
0802473156|5.0|72 Years old.  And never too old to learn.  My love language is not at all what I thought.  My husbands was exactly what I thought.  It is well worth the time to invest in your marriage no matter your age or how long you have been married.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always, John Grisham does it again, and again. Like all his books, &#34;The Racketeer&#34;  was fast passed, and very enjoyable.
0756655307|4.0|Pretty much everything you could need or want from the Marvel universe. I would like larger sections on some of my favorite characters, but if everyone got that, this massive book would be ridiculously huge. Very cool for the Marvel fan.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|This is one of the cutest musical CD's that I have purchased.  I listen to it at work on the Cloud.  Makes the day go by faster.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|I was trying to set up my tablet to print, so I was told I needed ePrint.  After spending hours with HP, I still am haveing trouble printing.  I don't know if it is the app, or my tablet.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am hooked on downtown abbey.  thank goodness for my prime membership - able to download season 1 and 2 to catch  up!  LOVE IT!!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|The acting was great ......never left the room.  The topic is little bit heavy.  Overall we enjoyed it. I recommend it to mature audiences
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We enjoyed this show a lot.  My daughter was anxiously awaiting its release and my kids watched it twice during our 24-hour rental period.  I thouht it was cute too and enjoyed the humor.  Not too scary, but I agree with the PG rating and suggest that kids be at least 5 or 6 to watch.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never had a book take me by surprise like this one! It started out okay, interesting characters, young love...then WOW, what a twist. I totally did not see that coming, and I couldn't put the book down; I had to see what happened. And after the main twist, there were more. I really liked how it all came together in the end and you understand the meaning in all the things that seemed like unimportant details at the start. It was a really good book. The subject matter wasn't always pleasant, but these things happen and it's positive to see that it is possible to get through it and go on.
B00003CX8V|5.0|I rented this at a video store years ago and loved it. You can't help but love Jack Lemmon's character.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|This is a killer album. If you grew up musically listening to Poco, Pure Prairie League, Rick Nelson & theStone Canyon Band, early Eagles, Dillard & Clark and so many others, this is where we all hoped it was headed. Buy this now.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Try a high blood pressure, stress, touch of insomnia, &amp; all sorts of other crap combo. This helped me to finally get some sleep, and veterans sleep than I'd gotten in a long time.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Great mix of tunes. Good beats; a very talented vocalist. Some really good cardio workout songs. A good album. yup.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy the game. It would be nice if it were more like the Windows version with the different layout choices, otherwise a fun game.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|I purchased this box set with the intention of watching it with my kids when they got a smidge older.  It's a year later and we're finally sitting down for a Harry Potter marathon.  Imagine our surprise when disc 3, clearly labeled Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azakaban is actually Polar Express.  I contacted Amazon and since it's been a while since we ordered the box set there's no desire to assist us with getting the correct disc.  We've skipped ahead to disc 4 and so far it's as advertised.  We'll see if we get any more mystery movies out of this.  My kids weren't thrilled with Polar Express to begin with, so it's a bummer all around.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|For some reason when I turn Temple Run 2 on it crashes! It's so frustrating! Please do something about it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I gave Downton Abbey 5 stars because I  have been hooked since Season1.  My mom told me about it and at first I was hesitant, but decided to give it a try. Wow, am I glad I did.  I had just finished reading Canadce Camp romance novels which take place in Europe, very Jane Austin like, but with hot and heavy love scenes. Because I was reading of an era long ago with Earls,Lords,Butlers,Maids, and young women needing to find a husband while attending the Ton, I was in the mood for Downton Abbey.  The scenery is amazing, the music is fantastic, the acting superb, and the plot is so good, I can't wait to see the next episode.  My husband, who favors action thrillers, is even addicted to it. The only thing I don't understand is why the uncut U.K. version isn't aired on PBS. I don't know the difference, for I have only watched the uncut versions because I buy it on Amazon so I can watch them anytime on my Kindle. In a nutshell, I love it!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Entertaining, but does not live up to the quality and thoughtfulness of the preceding films in the series. Despite being almost 3 hours long, the pace often felt rushed, which deflated moments that were meant to be infused with emotion, and reduced the charm of purposefully corny comic book one-liners to seeming out of place and silly.Transitions were clunky, and the narrative lacked coherence, such that I was often not entirely clear about what had transpired in a given scene. Overall, a disappointment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved it its no glitches the first temple run had some glitches and temple run brave I have always 3 temple runs
141659521X|5.0|I have read and love all of Flynn's books. The reality is overwhelming given today's political climate. Can't wait to read the next one.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|My grandson is a Lego lover and I sent him this for Christmas.  He rearranges it and connects it with his many other lego pieces.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I am a long time reader of John Grisham...I have bought all of them with the exception of one. Something about this one did not resonate with me -
1452101248|5.0|The directions are very easy to follow and the results are delicious! This book is great for people who are hesitant about cooking (i.e. me). I do not have much confidence when it comes to the kitchen, but this book is a great learning tool. Also, I absolutely love meat and did not think that I can be satiated with all-vegetable meals. These recipes proved me wrong! The pictures are gorgeous and the short stories for each recipe are intriguing.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|at first when I ordered it it was great but when I exited the game I couldn't reopen it and when I unistalled it the game wouldn't reinstall so now I can't play at all
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Have you ever wanted to own a horse? But couldn't afford it or maybe didn't have the space.. well here is your solution! Beautiful graphics.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is amazing! very addictive and learn a lot of new ideas for every aspect of your life. so many ideas to try!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Fans of Susan will not be disappointed!<br />She really delivers the songs, along with<br />Michael Crawford and Donny Osmond.<br />Encore!!!
0765325950|1.0|This series is outstanding in large part due to its rich, lengthy events.  Seems the only thing fully described in Memory of Light are the battles.  What happens after the battle to the characters I've come to know and love is either wrapped up in 2 sentences or totally ignored.  So very unsatisfactory.  This series needs another book or two to live up to this series.
B0088O11NU|1.0|Before I could even try the game, I had to go thru commercialism of other products. When I tried to go past the question it started freezing up my screen. So I just deleted the whole thing. I barely have enough time to play a game, I sure don't have time for that crap.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I don't want to give tune in a bad review because it used to be wonderful. However the app will no longer update. A glitch keeps it from installing, so now it's unusable. HTC Thunderbolt Verizon
0061537969|5.0|Great book! Great dog! Great stories! After I read this I gave it to my entire family and they all read it! 5 stars way up!
0767817664|5.0|Roddy Macdowall is brilliant as the campy Peter Vincent with Chris Sarandon as the vampire Jerry Dandridge (and yes Colin Farrrel did a good job too) Great makeup great movie.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|Independent film on a few different topics, mostly love lives and how compatible we are with others. Some puzzle pieces tend to fit nicely!
B0002KQNJU|5.0|A delicious black comedy, with incredible sets and scenery. A very funny take on the whole vampire genre, with even a gay vampire. Some wonderful actors
B00827OXJ2|4.0|Decent movie, great characters, sexy actresses! Definitely watchable and the ending is awesome! If you can get it cheaper, try.
B003AWRMCE|5.0|One of the top ten westerns of all time and what a superb cast, Clint is brilliant as the retired gunslinger turned hog farmerWill Munny turning one last hit job. Very brutal showing the west without the glamor
B005LAII9O|5.0|This movie rates &#34;high&#34; in my book! Awesome story, great characters and acting...and who doesn't love a movie about violence and weed!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. No need for cash. Updates automatically and often. Becomes more challenging the further you get and power boosts make it a blast! And it's perfect for all ages...my 5 yr old son and I love taking turns. Get it!
0425221806|5.0|It is a sci-fi type book, but if you are a dog owner/lover this is a great story to read.  Open your mind and let the true possibilities of your dog's intelligence shine through!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />I thought this book was really good until it took a turn that I did not find agreeable. I'm unsure why the author decided to make the main characters (who obviously had sexual chemistry) be brother and sister. I personally don't think it gave anything to the story-line, and, in fact, detracted from the main story.<br /><br />Overall, the book was full of action and suspense.  The characters were very likeable.  I just wasn't crazy about the ending.<br /><br />I have not yet read the rest of the series but I do plan on reading Book 2.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I am hooked on this series. Twists and turns that keep the viewer excited and desperate to see the next episode. :) I hate that I have to wait for season 4 to be released. Wish it would hurry up already!
B00917IQFY|4.0|Graham has not lost his touch. Great musicianship from his former players, evoking much of the sound of the original &#34;Rumor&#34;. The song &#34;Arlington's Busy&#34; made me cry and should be heard by every American.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Although it wasn't the best book in the series it was the the most emotional packed one. Absolutely loved it
B00992CF6W|5.0|its awesome and I love it I have it for my computer and my friend the same but when I try to multiplayer with him on PE (he has 0.6.0) it wont let me join like it used to(I have the kindle fire.) ( pe 0.5.0) and I checked for updates but it says that there is not a update for it can I have some help please?

B008AK8FHM|5.0|We have read numerous books regarding the possibility of Heaven's existence.  Many have been easily read and convincing.  Others have been more complex and written by physicians and well educated individuals.  This one, however, was written for everyone.  It is written very clearly and along with the appendices and extensive bibliography, not only reads in a very believable way, but also a way that is scientifically convincing.  My faith is strong and I have always believed in a life beyond, but this book was able to provide theoretical arguments that can't be easily denied.  I strongly recommend everyone who has questions or doubts read this.  You won't regret it.

0425252868|5.0|I have a special feel for this book because my own writing about the B-17 war ([[[...]]]) devoted a couple of chapters to events on the same mission in the same wing formation (303rd Bomb Group) that lies at the heart of this remarkable story.  In fact, the title of my book comes from an incident that occurred during this very mission!  (I also wrote about another mission covered in this story, the January 4, 1944 raid where a number of morning assembly, mid-air collisions took place between 303rd and 379th aircraft.)  Thus, it was fascinating to read about these events from the perspective of B-17 pilot Charlie Brown and the 379th Bomb Group.    The story told by the author has the absolute ring of truth in it, right down to the frozen .50 cal. machine guns that prevented Brown's crew from firing on Stigler's Bf-109 on December 20, 1943.  Time and again, recalling my own research and conclusions, I said to myself, \\"Yes, the author got this right.\\"  In fact, I saw only two errors in the whole work: (1) saying that the B-17 was powered by Pratt & Whitney engines instead of the Wright R-1820 Cyclone, and (2) the statement that Brown's B-17 had a .30 cal. MG in the nose, when at this time virtually every B-17F was retrofitted with one or two .50 cal. MGs in the Plexiglas nose because of the ineffectiveness of the lighter weapon.  However, on the second point the author might be right, who can really say today?    In any event, these points in no way tarnish the magnificence of the larger saga of Franz Stigler and his extraordinary act of mercy towards Brown's crew.  THAT was exceptional, especially during this period of the air war, when more often than I'd like to say both sides shot at helpless enemy airmen in parachutes.  What I especially liked about the \\"story-telling\\" here (and I use the phrase in the best sense of the words) was how the author got inside Stigler's head and made the reader understand that the decision to spare this crew came from Stigler's heart,and the religious, Catholic values instilled in him as a child.  Overall, I'd say that the plight of a good man fighting on the wrong side in a terrible war has rarely been so well presented.    This is a special work that was clearly researched exhaustively, and is a true labor of love.  My hat is off to the author for preserving a story of war and humanity that truly deserves to be remembered.
B004QX07G4|2.0|Ellen is such a great comic which is why I don't understand how she let this book get released. Navel gazing, smug, stream of consciuosness ramblings that sound like a first draft. Huge talent in need of a good editor

B000MR9D5E|4.0|David Attenborough's series is chock full of information and visuals that certainly grab one's attention. Extremely compelling and easily understandable.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|If you want more insight after seeing the movie &#34;Lincoln&#34;, this will satisfy your appetite.  Even though the book gives an historical view from all of Lincoln's cabinet members, the focal point still stays vivd and flowing - to let the reader feel the emotions of the fight to end slavery, and the civil war.  I have really enjoyed this book, even though I am not a civil war buff.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this action packed super fun game! Makes you keep wanting to come back again and again. Love the daily challenges!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|yesterday, I would have given this game 5 stars.  it was a lot of fun and I spent hours and was close to leveling to 98.  I logged in this morning to work on my town only to find my town was gone and was being asked to start over as so many others had, too. no.  just glad I never spent any money on it.<br /><br />OK, I love playing this game so I restarted.  Once again I got to the point I had previously at about level 92 and suddenly I had a friend's town sitting on the bottom half of mine.  It was a mess and unfixable. I didn't even bother to report it since I saw on the forums that many many other people had had the same problem with no replies.<br /><br />My advice is NOT to spend any real money on this game as you will eventually lose it all in one of the frequent game crashes.  But if you just want a game with no expectations of ever completing much, it's a fun time waster.

B0091THDOM|1.0|My little bro got me a black one. It was really tight but I thought it will stretch out eventually. I was wrong. I have a matte ghost armor cover on my IP5, it is almost impossible to get it in and out. Had it been 1-2 millimeter wider this would have been the best option in the market. Do not buy this product. If you must, go with the brown one.
1616550414|5.0|The title really says it all: if the Zelda franchise has held your interest and continues to fascinate you - even well into adulthood - then there's really no way this book isn't going to make you smile.  It provides unique insight into the design process with hundreds of images, showcasing some design concepts that made the cut, and others that hit the edit room floor.  It's quite interesting to see how this process produces a polished, finished product that often stands simultaneously as an example of whimsical entertainment and fine art.<br /><br />The detailed chronology of all the games is something I look forward to digesting over time.  This is like reading a world history textbook on a land that exists solely in our minds.  To me, this provides one of those exciting exercises of the imagination that only fictitious settings provide.<br /><br />I'll close how I opened: if you love playing Zelda games, this book will make you just plain happy.

Albert and Victoria's love story was beautiful. They were so devoted to each other. She was alittle lost in the beginning of her reigin, but with Alberts help she grew to be one of Britian's most beloved monarchs. I highley recomend this wonderful movie. CWT

B009DH2PP4|5.0|I purchased \\"How To Brew...\\" because it was very highly rated and I was interested in his all-grain section which I heard was quite good. I thought I would skim through the more basic material and just really read the all-grain section, but I found myself reading the whole thing.<br /><br />Lots of great technical detail throughout. Because of this, it surprises me that it is often referenced as a great beginner book.  If you want a beginner book with less technical detail then try Papazian's \\"Joy of Homebrewing\\" or \\"Homebrewing For Dummies\\". But, if you don't mind more detail, then this book should see you through from beginner to advanced.<br /><br />The All Grain section is quite good. Very clear presentation of all-grain techniques without getting lost in the technical details (but they are still there).  Simple and practical presentation of techniques like batch sparging and decoction mash.<br /><br />Unique section on brewing metallurgy. Turns out Palmer is a professional metallurgist and a brewer so uniquely qualified to write this section.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I feel that anyone who has read the first two will truly enjoy this book. But if you haven't read the first to i suggest you do.<br />First: Hunger Games<br />Second: Catching Fire<br />Last: Mokingjay

0765325950|4.0|No spoilers.  This book continues with Sanderson's typical high standard of writing and showcases his ability to wrap up an enormous number of plot threads while staying true to the foundation laid by Jordan. However, I do not think that this book is as good as the previous two, as there are some legitimate issues this time around and the conclusion simply didn't satisfy.  The only real technical problem with this book was the overabundance of battles, but that alone wouldn't have knocked this review down to four stars. There was a lot to like about this book: the complexity of the plot in which an incredible number of characters and factors played crucial roles, Mat's hilarious thoughts and dialogue and general awesomeness, and for the most part, the right characters living and dying. This is the only book in the series where major characters die with no coming back, fitting giving the battle going on. The real problem with this book, upon finishing it, was that I felt a sense of...questioning, if the journey was really worth this conclusion.  The ending is satisfactory on an immediate level. We know who lives and who dies, what turns out for who...but we don't know which way the road will lead for the survivors afterwards. This could have been easily accomplished through the use of a time skip, showing older versions of the remaining characters and their children much later. As it is, however, we don't know. For that reason, the ending isn't satisfying on a deeper level. This is somewhat to be expected, given that the epilogue was a piece hastily written out by a dying man who was two and a half thousand pages away from it, just to ensure that his work wouldn't go unfinished, and the series was completed by an author who has a tendency to only give the barest bones of conclusions to his works. AMoL's ending had little more to it than the Mistborn Trilogy's, and that is a very low thing to say about it.  I read and enjoyed every novel in the Wheel of Time up to this one (though the enjoyment wasn't there as much in the tenth), but was this ending worth twelve thousand pages and twenty three years? No, I don't think so. This ending was a postscript. It described good events, but it was a postscript nonetheless. Lacking that, was the journey itself worth it? I guess so, but only barely. While I never really found anything bad about any of the individual novels, now looking back at the series as a whole, I'm more sure than ever that it was far too long for its story. Yes, the immense girth of the Wheel of Time is obvious to anyone who ever picked up any of the books, but that's the ultimate truth of it. Even the earlier books could have been greatly improved if trimmed down, and I think that I may have been too kind in hindsight. The prose was always the weakness, always describing things we didn't want to read about and ignoring what we don't want to read about, in everything from clothing to characters. This could have been a legendary creation of fantasy if it had been as lean as the final trilogy from the beginning and a more detailed ending had been waiting, but it wasn't.  Despite the critical nature of this review, I did enjoy aMoL. It's a very good book and a worthy creation, but given that this is the last book, I feel like I'm reviewing the series as a whole in a way, and the fact remains that aMoL was a fantastically written book held back by protracted battle sequences and a lacking ending. In the end, the Wheel of Time was a slow moving series that really picked up and improved for its last three books but didn't give the closure that we wanted.

B00596WEVI|3.0|Jean-Claude Van Damme and Scott Adkins (both featured in &#34;The Shepard,&#34; &#34;Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,&#34; and &#34;The Expendables 2&#34;) are reunited as two assassins after the same target but for different reasons. The film works like the Stallone/Banderas actioner &#34;Assassins.&#34; That film was enjoyable, but it's 130-minute runtime brought it down. &#34;Assassination Games&#34; is thirty minutes shorter, and actually seems to cram in more action in an hour and a half than &#34;Assassins&#34; did. To call &#34;Games&#34; superior may seem like an odd thing for one to say, but between Van Damme's carefully fine-tuned presence and Adkins' usual charisma, it's hard to deny the difference between those two and Stallone and Antonio Banderas is quite noticeable. The movie also looks polished and well-edited, especially for a film that did not go to theaters. Van Damme looks good and Adkins is someone to root for. Adkins' career is certainly moving up, and he's someone to watch for. Van Damme is a classic, and in this one he shows he can still literally kick bad-guy butt!
B008X9Z37A|4.0|The only thing I don't like, it does not have a closure.  I put a elastic band around it when not in use.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it.  Use it several times a day.  Every time I go outside as our weather has been really bad for a while.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I had seen Kenny Loggins several times alone and always loved his music, his enthusiasm and his showmanship. At one concert he talked about how he wanted to start a band and people told him he was too old...so, of course, he was going to do it. He brought out Georgia Middleman and Gary Burr and they sang a couple of songs. I was immediately hooked! At the next concert, the Blue Sky Riders opened for Kenny (or, as he said, \\"I'm opening for myself\\") and they were fantastic. I have waited for this CD with great anticipation and it does not disappoint one bit.<br /><br />Georgia Middleman and Gary Burr are outstanding musicians in their own right and, added to Kenny Loggins, the band has a beautiful sound full of harmonies with three super lead voices. The songs tell meaningful stories about life, love and being human. I especially like \\"A Thousand Wild Horses\\" saying you either can ride or get trampled- life is like that.\\"Little Victories\\" is one of the most beautiful songs about recovering from loss ever written and I can't listen to it enough. \\"Dream\\" sounds like something put together by people who were told they couldn't succeed and still forged ahead, an anthem for everyone. The other songs deal with emotions we all have (\\"You're Not the Boss of Me,\\" \\"Feeling Brave\\") and they blend rock and country into perfect melodies.<br /><br />I can't think that anyone would not love this CD, a fitting successor to all the great folk/rock/country groups that have come along. Great original writing and can't-stop-listening singing. You couldn't ask for more!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awsome what are you making next for apps and what made you want to make subway surfers

1250007208|5.0|I picked up Cinder on the advice of a couple of good reading buddies, though I wasn't so sure it would be anything new in the world of fairy tale retellings. I'm beyond delighted to report that it far exceeded my expectations! Not wasting time in recounting the plot, I will simply list what I enjoyed so much about this well-written book.<br /><br />Likes:  Cinder herself. Despite being part cyborg, she's amazingly real with authentic human emotions. I loved the interaction between Cinder and her little sister Peony (and that was only reinforced by what happened later). I liked how Cinder took responsibility for Iko who was really nothing more than a machine, and I thought the relationship between Cinder and Kai was fun and teasing. Unlike some reviewers, I didn't feel it was too rushed because occasionally we meet someone and we just click with them, and I felt that was what happened between those two. I liked Cinder's sarcastic sense of humor, and I loved her mechanic skills! The plot, while never losing sight of its general theme of a retelling, did move in unexpected, if somewhat puzzling, ways, and the true evil of Queen Levanna has me wondering just how she's going to be ultimately defeated. And the way Cinder met challenges? Brilliant, even when she seemed to have given up. I will never count her out.<br /><br />Dislikes/Quibbles:  Cinder did get into the ball a little too easily, even if I could explain it away by her \\"gift\\"; in fact, she really did have a lot of freedom of movement in a city under siege. Oh well...big deal. It's a fairy tale, right? And I did figure out the big reveal amazingly early, though my interest never wavered despite knowing where we were headed. And yep, that's all I can think of as far as dislikes.<br /><br />Cinder is such fun and such an original take, mixing fantasy and sci-fi, that the pages turned themselves. I'm in this series for the long haul--Ms. Meyer's writing has captured me fully. On to the next one!

B005PK553C|3.0|I usually like this kind of tv or film but this goes a little too far.  Also, seeing actors I really think highly of being the way they are portrayed in this series  was a little painful.  The pilot was really good but quickly went down hill as the series wore on.

B009D5VNLS|4.0|We liked this film of a young woman coming to gripes with the life and times of Royal Princessing.  Its a fantasy, so who cares if it appears that in her short life neither of her parents mentioned that she was to be married to one of three local clan Princes when she comes of age.<br /><br />In a comedy of unintended consequences she navigates her way helped by her silent brothers, a delightful witch, (oops I mean wood carver) and her well meaning parents.<br /><br />We recommend this film that works on many levels.<br /><br />Scott & Barbara Combs
B009O2XY12|5.0|Many challenging levels to hold your interest. You can play at your own speed. I like that you can plat without having to do in app purchases.
B005H29GSI|4.0|I have this game and the [[ASIN:B008RWVE8A Angry Birds Star Wars Fighter Pods Jenga Death Star]].<br /><br />The Angry Birds on thin Ice comes with birds, plastic pigs with helmets and the blocks and ice.<br /><br />You build quality is good and all the pieces fit together well and lay flat on a table. The catapult works well for short ranges up to around 2-3 feet away.<br /><br />The big fat red bird is a nice soft plastic but the pigs are made from cheaper hard plastic and have flat faces. The birds and pigs from the Death Star version are much nicer.<br /><br />This game comes with a stack of cards which assign point values for knocking down different tower builds with different birds. A good idea but really the kids just build what they want and knock it down.<br /><br />So far this game has much better replay value than the more expensive Death Star version and I would recommend the On Thin Ice version over the Death Star version.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up. Thanks!
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I have to say that I was not impressed with the first two albums released by Black Veil Brides. This newest album, Wretched and Divine, changes my opinion about the band. This album brings me back to the 1980s when Faith No More, Queensryche, Megadeth, Metallica, Def Leppard and Motley Crue were in their heyday. I applaud the band on their effort here. This has the making of a great album with such songs as \\"New Years Day\\", \\"We Don't Belong\\", \\"Resurrect the Sun\\" and \\"Shadows Die\\".

B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This is a simple tale that packs quite an emotional wallop. The initiation of a paralyzed man into a pleasurable and meaningful experience of sex is handled with a humor and humanity that radiates from one wounded body to a host of other souls. Not nearly as sentimental or smirky as I would have imagined, it left me reflecting more deeply on how - as Leonard Cohen puts it -it's through our cracks and wounds that the light gets in. First-rate acting by John Hawkes, William H. Macy, Helen Hunt, and an ensemble I hope to see in more films.

Regardless, just plug it in and add your network password - done. Along with a free smartphone app from Onkyo's web site, you can control your device from your phone.<br /><br />I noticed in several reviews that people wrote &#34;didn't work with my model XXXX receiver&#34; then went on to indicate they owned a receiver that Onkyo clearly says this device is not meant for - read the description, folks!
B009IQG5LK|5.0|If there is one instance that anyone can withstand Madonna's superbly bad acting this is it!<br /><br />This is because Beatty's Dick Tracy is not only faithful to the original comic strip but also innovate in composites made for the background. They are, by the way, quite revealing in the Blu-Ray edition. Disney has made a terrific job for both picture and audio in this release, and thus worth the effort to purchase.

B00441GYZQ|2.0|A Sydney Pollack film starring Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas sounded like a great way to spend a Friday evening.  After all, Sabrina (another Pollack and Ford film) was a delightful love story.  Sadly, Random Hearts was not.<br /><br />The movie started out interesting enough...Harrison Ford plays the role of tough Washington DC Internal Affairs cop, Dutch Van Den Broeck whose wife perishes in a terrible plane crash along side of a man who turns out to be the husband of Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas), a Congresswoman running for re-election.  When Dutch comes to the realization that his wife was having an affair, he begins to hound Kay in an attempt to bring closure for himself.  He doesn't understand the affair or the why's of it and spends the entire movie looking hopelessly for explanations that only his wife could have given him.<br /><br />Kay pushes him away for awhile refusing to talk.  But then, for no apparent reason, she drops the \\"I'll call the cops if you come near me again\\" façade and follows him to Miami (the destination their spouses were heading to before the plane went down).  There are some good scenes filmed in this portion of the movie.  Dutch goes to the hotel his wife and Kay's husband had stayed on previous trips.  He enters the room that they had always occupied and the camera focuses meaningfully on the bed and the comfortably large tub.  The implied imagery is very powerful.  But then after the trip, without any sort of real lead-in, Dutch and Kay are suddenly very close and have the violent make-out scene in the car.  Hence, the strange and somewhat twisted romance between the two begins.<br /><br />Throughout the rest of the film, the feelings that Kay has towards Dutch seem oddly out of place.  She had been so adamantly against him...even uncaring, and now suddenly she's completely wrapped up him.  Can't get him out of her mind, wants to be with him, etc.  But it's all too fast...none of this really feels plausible.  Meanwhile, Dutch has this whole other life going on in Law Enforcement Land where he's chasing down and beating up dirty cops and making threats on people.  Frankly, this didn't need to be in there at all.  The story's ending is sort of drawn from this, but not necessarily because it had to be.  This movie could have finished out a dozen different and more \\"touching\\" ways, but instead it ended leaving everyone a bit frustrated.<br /><br />Ford's performance was fine given the character, but this was not the best role for him...and not a role I think most would enjoy him in.  He pulled off the part about as well as he could, but the character was too obsessive over his late-wife's affair for anybody to feel comfortable about it.  Kristin Scott Thomas fit her character well and did a commendable job, especially in scenes with her daughter.  The character's only major flaw was what came across as almost pathetic neediness when she was with Dutch.  Neither part was particularly likable.<br /><br />The story is captivating enough to keep you interested for about the first hour.  After that, you might find yourself wondering when it will end.  I expected more from movie over 2 hours long.  Overall, Random Hearts was not worth my Friday evening.  Don't bother.hile, Dutch has this whole other life going on in Law Enforcement Land where he's chasing down and beating up dirty cops and making threats on people.

B00867GHS8|5.0|I've been waiting so long for this movie to come out in Blu-Ray!  And then I had to buy a 3D TV so I could watch the 3D version of the movie.  Both versions are so much fun to watch, and the story line is a classic.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|In a word - HYSTERICAL!  I remember seeing this for the first time in the theater and laughed so hard, I almost didn't catch all the dialogue. I firmly believe that anyone who has ever worked in an office cubical situation or in food service (and I have done both) will be able to appreciate every bit of the humor presented. This was one of those small-time movies that just popped up out of nowhere and has managed to climb the cult movie ranks.<br /><br />Based on the comic strip Milton by Mike Judge (creator of Beavis and Butthead) Office Space goes the extra length to take pretty much every stereotype in the book and magnify it to the umpteenth degree. Imagine every weird coworker you've ever encountered...every cubical you've ever worked in...every boss you've wanted to strangle, put them in a company called Initech, and then move them all to The Far Side and you might just have an idea of what this movie is all about.<br /><br />The main character in the film isn't Milton, however, as the comic strip title would suggest. Instead it's a guy named Peter (played by Ron Livingston). Milton is in the film and adds a really humorous (but also sad) dimension to the movie (there is a certain level of morbid humor throughout). Stephen Root (who up until this movie, had been best known for his character Jimmy James on News Radio) plays Milton and really gave the best performance overall.<br /><br />There is an underlying plot line, in case you were wondering. The company (Initech) calls for a couple of consultants, known as \\"Efficiency Experts\\" to come in and do a little--shall we say (with air quotes)--`housecleaning'. As one insane plot builds on another, the Efficiency Experts promote Peter, but fire two of his fellow cubical-mates so they all begin scheming together to find a way to rip off their evil and incredibly patronizing boss, Lumburgh (played by Gary Cole).<br /><br />Offices are not always fun environments to work in, but thanks to them, movies like this one can be made.an be made.

B002BRRTUO|5.0|Totally forgot about this movie til TED reminded me. Still too campy for words. Made me search out Barbarella. If you loved Flash you'll love Jane.
B001992NUQ|5.0|It's difficult to know what to say about this film without turning my review into a spoiler, so my words will have to be chosen carefully.  We'd had a lot of \\"surprise\\" films that came out around the same time as Fight Club, so this film fit right in.  A \\"surprise\\" film defined: just when you think you know what's going on...SURPRISE you don't!<br /><br />Director David Fincher (Se7en, The Game) does another psychological number on us with this one. From a technical standpoint, the cinematography was great...the angles alone made for an entertaining film to watch. And the story only made it better.<br /><br />Edward Norton (Rounders, Primal Fear) gives a captivating performance as a basic white-collar worker who is tired of his 9 to 5, Ikea-furnished existence. His life takes a turn for the better (or is it for the worst?) when he meets Brad Pitt who plays Tyler Durden, an energetic soap-maker. Tyler seems to have the answers to everything and shows him a whole world that he never knew existed...a world where other men take out their anger over their own lives in a secret boxing ring. The boxing ring (known as \\"Fight Club\\" to its members) is only the jumping off point for a whole string of other events, which Norton gets dragged into. The story is mostly narrated by Norton which is useful in giving us a little more background than we might have had otherwise, and it works well. The only time the narration becomes somewhat distracting was when Norton speaks directly at the camera rather than just being a voice-over. There was only one time that this occurred and seemed rather inconsistent with the rest of the film.<br /><br />Pitt also performed well, and was enjoyable in this role when he was being something of a visionary as well as when he was just downright devious.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter (A Room With A View, Howard's End) plays Marla Singer, a girl with some serious issues (drug related and otherwise) who becomes involved with Durden and ends up hanging around more than she is wanted. Carter does an excellent job in this role and definitely seems to have shed any traces of her previous period work.<br /><br />Another surprise in this film was Meat Loaf in the part of Bob, a guy with testicular cancer that you end up really feeling for thanks to Meat Loaf's performance. You can't help but want to hug him.<br /><br />As for the violence, there is a lot. But the film has so much more to it that you can't help but be fascinated anyway. Those who care to look past the violence will find much to mull over. You may find yourself cringing at times, but ultimately unable to turn away. And you may even catch yourself wanting to see it again once you know the ending to try and use your foreknowledge to see what clues you may have missed along the way.<br /><br />Fight Club turned out to be a great way to kill a couple of hours...but it is not a veg-out movie by far.

B008133MDK|5.0|Honestly the best series ever, both Season One and this season.  Brilliant acting by Benedict Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman, & Co.  Exciting episodes with intense scenes, especially in the second and last episode.  Heartbreaking cliffhanger at the ending-prepare your tissues and to lose control of your feels!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Robert Parker writes good novels, and Tom Selleck does an outstanding job portraying recovering alcoholic and Paradise Police Chief Jesse Stone.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I found this book to be very slow and boring compared to the first 2 books. I was happy with the ending...
B000QXDFQW|4.0|In two words: great movie! Of course it had flaws, as all films do, but essentially they were few and far between and relatively insignificant. The basis of the film lies in terrorism. Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges), who teaches a class in extremists at a local university, begins to suspect his neighbors Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusak) of being more than what they appear. Faraday begins to find inconsistencies in the stories Oliver gives him and what the truth reveals and the story unfolds from there.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges did a good job, but with a lot of heavy breathing, which I'm sure was convey panic and fear, however it tended to get on my nerves. Also in his classes, he would be talking about terrorist groups and events which they clearly must not have been able to use actual names and places where true attacks occurred, so instead they showed the faces of people we all know, but gave them different names which was intriguing, but also somewhat distracting.<br /><br />Tim Robbins just did a wonderful job, and I was thrilled to see him in such a good film, joined by Joan Cusak who gave an worthy performance...and even though you didn't see a whole lot of their kids, they managed to carry off a definite spookiness that really added to the atmosphere and mood of that whole house. Something else that impressed me was that such a relatively small nucleus of a cast managed to pull off such an involved plot and storyline. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film.<br /><br />The ending which I won't give away, but have to let it be said that I thought it was incredibly thought provoking and perfect for the film. Couldn't have been a better ending and that's important. In many cases an ending can make or break the film. The last movie I saw was great, but the ending could have been a lot better which really hurt the overall film.<br /><br />Good start, good story, good ending.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|I spend a really good moment watching this very original, surrealistic and cleverly made Norwegian fantasy movie and it cheered me up no end. Below more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />\\"Troll Hunter\\" is a \\"found footage\\" film, like \\"Blair's Witch Project\\". Three students try to make a documentary film about a certain Hans, who has the reputation of a dangerous albeit never convicted poacher. Pretty fast, they will discover that in reality he hunts a game infinitely more dangerous and exotic than bears and also that he works for a secret agency of Norwegian government. At that moment the courageous trio decides to discover all the truth about this shady organisation.<br /><br />This film is an excellent comedy, even if on the surface of things everything is treated with the greatest seriousness. We progressively learn a lot about trolls and even more about people in charge of control of their population and movements. Some moments are purely irresistible, but my absolute favourite is the visit in a very powerful electric plant in the middle of nowhere and the conversations with its crew...))) Believe me, you REALLY want to see this part of film.<br /><br />Being Polish I very much liked the scene when some (probably not very recommendable) people hailing from our noble tribe come to do business (and haggle) with Hans. I also pretty much liked the explanation why it is definitely better to take a Muslim, rather than a Christian to hunt the trolls...)))<br /><br />All actors are really doing great in this film, the scenario is excellent and the visual aspect of the film (mountains, forests, fjords, streams and trolls) is first class. Finally, the low key but very intelligent kind of humour is a pure TREASURE!<br /><br />I really, REALLY liked this film and I will definitely re-watch it again. To buy, watch and keep. Enjoy!

0375703764|5.0|This novel is not a sequel to Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass' , in fact it's not like anything I've ever read before. Welcome to the world of ergodic literature. This was my first foray into this genre, and I liked it. This genre requires the reader to make a real effort to read and interpret the text. There are different ergodic levels, such as, Charlton Mellick III's bizarro 'Cuddly Holocaust' , or Ayn Rand's play 'Night of January 16th' , a murder trial where the jury is picked out of the audience and their verdict will decide the outcome of the play. I'm not sure where Mark Z. Danielewski's novel fits in the world of ergodicity, but I'll give the next reader an idea of what's in store for you: hundreds of footnotes ( some real and most not ), one to four texts on the same page, some pages blank, some with one or two words, some pages upside down, some obliquely angled, and different narrators on the same page. And why is the word `house' always in blue and `minotaur' in red? I have to say that some of the footnotes are pure genius. The reader does eventually understand what's going on, because the diverse narrators, and variant footnotes are in distinctive fonts! Absolutely brilliant!<br /><br />The postulation of this book is that it's the true story of an old man's dissertation of a documentary film called The Navidson Record. A blind old man named Zampano walks around his apartment complex every day followed by 80 cats. One of the sidebar characters, Lude, also lives in the building. One day Zampano drops dead in his apartment facedown with deep claw marks alongside his body. Since there isn't any trauma to the body, it is deemed a natural death. Lude calls his friend, Johnny Truant, a tattoo parlor employee, that there is a apartment available in his building. Johnny comes quickly to see the apartment, and discovers a trunk full of notes and documents about a film called The Navidson Report. Johnny takes the trunk home and starts reading, arranging and editing Zampano's papers, even after he finds out that there is no such film. The story never defines where the six to seven inch claw marks came from, or why the 80 cats disappeared after the old man's death. This is a strange story. The reader doesn't know what is real, or fake throughout the 709 pages.<br /><br />Will Navidson, his companion, Karen Green and their children, Daisy and Chad move into a house on Ash Tree Lane in the Jamestown area of Virginia. Will is a Pulitzer Prize winning photojournalist, Karen is an ex-model, and they are trying to see if they can save their commonwealth marriage. Will decides to mount cameras in every room and film the move to see how \\"everything turns out\\" in the relationship after getting a Guggenheim Fellowship and a media arts grant for the project. The family goes to Seattle, and when they come back they discover that the house is slightly bigger inside versus outside. Then a closet between their bedroom and the childrens suddenly appears, then overnight a large dark hallway emerges out of nowhere. What is going on? He seeks help from his friend, Billy Reston and then finally from famed explorer and hunter, Holloway Roberts and his crew. They explore the dark hallway three times without success. Meanwhile, usually on the same page, Johnny Truant is telling the story of Zampano's notes on the Navidson film and his own life story at the same time.<br /><br />As Navidson's life gets byzantine with the arcane house, Johnny's life is one drunken sexual escapade after another, as he starts losing his mind over Zampano's papers. We meet Thumper, the stripper, and many of Zampano's ex-scribes, to which Johnny has sex with. Then on The fourth exploration of the dark hallway in the house on Ash Tree lane, the great explorer, Holloway Roberts and crew don't return! Periodic growls are heard in the walls, sometimes close, sometimes far away. Johnny continues to lose his mind. As he thinks about the missing cats, he says to himself \\" Something else has taken their place. Something I am unable to see. Waiting.\\" In the interim Will tells his distressed wife \\"They've been in there almost eight days with water for six. It's three in the morning...\\" So Will and his brother, Tom and Billy Reston decide to go into the dark hallway and find Holloway and his crew. Meanwhile Johnny thinks to himself \\"My fear's gotten worse...My teeth ache. My head aches. My stomach's a mess.\\" Back at the house, things are bleak as the house has finally started to attack! If this paragraph seems confusing, well get used to it, because that's the motif of this newfangled, but extraordinary novel. I've only given you a taste of what's to come! Prepare to have your blood run cold.thing else has taken their place. Something I am unable to see.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|When i first found this mouse on the site i was a little unsure about how well it would meet my expectations, and the fact that as of that day the only reviews it had were 4 or 5 stars which seems a little too good to be true when you look at other products,but after it arrived im happy to say that all of my worries were put to rest.<br />  I will say ahead of time that i have fairly large hands and that may have an impact on others experience, but from the moment i first plugged it in and gave it the quick test run it has been the most comfortable mouse i have ever used.The overall shape seems to fit in my hand perfectly , and although the side buttons look huge and clunky in the pictures in my case they have never gotten in the way and the placement is one of the most functional i have ever used.<br />  I am using this mouse as a gaming mouse and i really love the option to customize all of the buttons, I have had many other products that promise full customization and when you get them there are always those few buttons such as your dpi switch that can never be changed, for some that may not seem like a big deal but for gamers any extra button is a blessing, i know some may argue that there are other products out there with more buttons or features such as the razor naga, but as much as I love having more mouse buttons i believe there is a certain point where it just gets too ridiculous and this product seems to find just the right balance.<br />  The overall quality is very high from the braided cord to actual body you can tell this mouse is built to last,the side buttons are maybe the only spot i would question given that they have a small amount of vertical movement and i do mean very small,but when you look at how they are used and how your thumb actually goes to them, I am almost certain that this is an intention of the design and not something to really worry aobut.<br />  The mouse wheel feels like it is set back a little ways compared to other mice i havetried but it is also a slightly smaller wheel than i am used to,this is primarily to grant you access to the top middle button that can be seen in the pictures and overall it has a great feel to it.<br />  What may be the only complaint that i have seen is that the anker logo is fully color customizable with many preset choices and even the ability to make a custom color, but this will not affect the dpi indicator or the mouse wheel. I personally dont mind given that the factory blue setting is what i like anyway but i have noticed some others give this product a 4 star rating simply due to that, and when i comes down to it im not looking at the pretty colors when im playing anyway.<br />  Bottom line is if you are a gamer who wants a good mouse to place all of your hot keys or even just a casual computer user this mouse has alot to offer with a great feel and a decent price.

The romance and the love between the characters helped soften the otherwise depressing and heartbreaking outline of the story. The story gives hope of young love still being important and meaningful.

B004HEXSLI|5.0|I love reading books like this because they can give you a whole new perspective on the things that matter most in life. I found Dr. Jill Taylor's story to be a fascinating read - well told and, as the title suggests, in many ways &#34;insightful&#34; too. This is medical science at its best - when it has a deeper meaning than just charts and facts, and when it's written so that even an every-day non-doctor like me can enjoy it. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in an &#34;insightful&#34; read.

There was no disc included (a plus, in my book) so drivers and software come from Corsair's website.  The mouse functioned without drivers, of course, but the pointer had a curious life of it's own until the firmware was updated.  And, frankly, the firmware and software installation could be streamlined.  As of the date I set the mouse up (end of January, 2013) the installation zip package contains a firmware updater AND mouse software.  You must run the firmware updater FIRST.  Even though I followed those instructions, the mouse continued to act up until I uninstalled the drivers and software, and started the process over by reflashing the firmware.  Not a terrible experience, but not what you expect out of the box.<br /><br />The mouse feels great.  The weight is good (and adjustable).  The sides of the mouse have a rougher texture which improve grip without being rubbery.  The mouse wheel is smooth and the buttons are mostly well located.  The mouse moves across surfaces smoothly.  I honestly enjoy using it.  It's one of the nicer mouses I've used.<br /><br />I do have to shift how I hold the mouse, slightly, in order to reach the sniper button, but it's comfortable either way.  The lights are great, assuming you like blue, and can be shut off (my preference).<br /><br />Comments about the software are, in my opinion, on the right track but a bit overblown.  It's not the easiest software to use, particularly when recording macros.  However, basic button settings, response rate settings, and dpi settings are very easy.  For hardcore gamers who frequently play multiple games, swapping settings might get annoying.  But for more casual gamers or gamers dedicated to one game at a time, the software is just too small a part of the experience to really be a problem.  It's not perfect, but it works.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great buy for me.  I'm very happy with it.
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|it is a nice set to have for not only for display. it is so nice that i would not use it for intensive playing.<br />By the way, if you are a fan of South Park, this is a must to have it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It wakes me up so I'm good with this app.<br /><br />It got me up put fell back asleep in bed after I could solve the math problem.
B00021HBGS|4.0|We bough this for a little friend of ours and it got here when it said it would which was great because their birthday was coming right up!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|not sure how Bc every time I try to use the app it just opens the web browser to the mobile facebook page. so I'm a little disappointed with this app.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Battery HE Pro leaves nothing to chance when it comes to getting work done and having a bit of fun.  As I schedule my day ... laundry, cooking, running around or just resting between tasks ... I know exactly how much battery life is available to catch a movie while sitting in the laundry room, doctor's office, etc.  I know if my Kindle should be plugged in before taking on what used to be  mundane tasks so I'll be able to see a full length movie or stay plugged into the internet while taking on those dreary tasks.<br /><br />Simple as 1 2 3 - open Kindle, touch the large battery icon and see how much time you have available to view movies, read, talk, browse, etc.  Very convenient app. I highly recommend.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Easy to play, when you get shocked it shows the skeleton of the guy.  Great game for this age group.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Although I am a gluten free minimalist runner, I loved the stories in this book. If you want motivation to go the extra mile or deal with a little pain, knowing what Scott has run through should provide that motivation. I only skimmed through the recipes, as most of them had wheat products, but they were of no hindrance to reading the book. Some of these stories will give you a new view of what ultra runners go through.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well I think this game is grovvvy dude like riding waves but u no it's never been stepping on my surfboard bro
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is awesome!!! So adventurous and entertaining! I really enjoy playing it! How about you try it? It'll be fun. I promise.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I love the Chronological Bible, but I can't get the app on my Kindle Fire HD to work right. I had it for about twenty days and then it disappeared. I can't reload it and I can't delete the the one I had.Really frustrating. BUT, THE BIBLE READINGS ARE GREAT IF YOU CAN ACCESS THEM. Would rate a five if app worked!
B002VPE1X4|5.0|Nothing special about this bag. The price was right since it was free with a bundle deal. It works as a cheap basic bag and has a place where it can be strapped through a belt.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My seven year old son just loves it.  Cool graphics and you get to zip line while playing.  Much more improved than the original  Temple Run.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I did not expect this type of writing from such a famous accomplished author....  The language was too strong for me
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the series however the quality of the picture for this season is  horrible. Shame Amazon you have done better..
B00A31UXLW|5.0|As always, Michael Connelly's books are just fantastic.  He takes you into the Los Angeles police procedural work and opens the door into life there.  Always interesting for someone who likes to peer into the underbelly via fiction rather than real life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Girls have something but u need to rind out. the boyesnsuck though owlish keen where r the cool thinks so do plaese play it is cool. but the girls need to have there things Bob around
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|I lived in the bronx on Arthur Ave there were italian restaurants,pizza stores and such guys on corners  singing those great songs that are now oldies.This movie  brings back so many memories  some brings smiles other memories just wish it was not like that.<br />When your watching this movie you are drawn into it and when it ends  you can't wait to see it again and again because it is so true to life,details, the way so many of us grew up,and of course when you come from New York and grow up in the Bronx,and are Italian you have a very distant accent... like me... if you don't have this movie you need to buy it..
B00992CF6W|5.0|People say minecraft is for boys but I am a girl and I love it !!! There is so much more blocks on this minecraft then the free version !!!! It is also sooo much fun for two players also AND I love it!!!
0399215980|4.0|I too, was a little confused by the book, Do You Want to be My Friend? I had purchased the book for my 3 yr. old grandson.  I decided to read the book with Mouse asking each animal to be his friend and when each animal says YES, Mouse replies, \\"Thank You\\"  I'm laughing as I type this, but at the end I had the Boa Constrictor ask \\"Will you be My Friend?\\"  What can I say - it works for my grandson and me.  Love the illustrations.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had missed all of the episodes of season three and was able to catch up. I  watched  them on my MacBook and found that although I did not have the experience of  the big TV screen of my home, I could watch not only Downton Abbey but other series The availability through Amazon was an excellent watch my favorite TV programs and movies on my own time anywhere. Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Class game, excellent graphics, fast gameplay gets trickier  and faster the further you go could do with some mini games, gets a bit repetitive but very addictive
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book i think! Hard to put it down and love the story line. I would recommend to my friends.
0767827716|5.0|First  of all the music is fantastic.. the movie flows from  suspense, and  if you happen to be out looking at old cars  and see one just like this... you better run the other way .... fast!  Why you ask.... well  guess you will have to see the movie  it is a classic horror..unlike anything you have ever seen.  GREAT MOVIE! You need to have this one in your collection!
B000006NX5|5.0|I fell in love the first time in my life listening to this album. I had problems finding the entire album with all the songs in the exact order I remember. It is exactly the way I remember. The music is clear and brilliant. I love the digital age.  Unfortunately,  the love didn't last.....but as you well know, the music always does. Thank you for the memories. . . . &#34;it is better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all.&#34;
1595825045|5.0|Any artist and animator should have this book, It is a masterpiece! Contains the whole process of making and incredible art!
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Got this album after I herd the first single once, each song is better than the last. I got her other album which is different I prefer this sound, but the other album is great too. Totally buy
B004TI5N38|4.0|Once again Baldacci sends his readers on a wild ride.Puller is a great character and reminds one of Jack Reacher.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual Vince Flynn is awesome. The 'main character Mitch Rapp is the man we all should be. Can't wait for the next book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A beautifully written book about life, death, and love. It shows through the s***tiest health conditions of two bright individuals how they accept death and what comes with it. Amazing read and inspirational. With this note in mind I would like to thank John Green and recommend this book to anyone with a heart.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the trilogy starting with The Hunger Games.  Good to read them in order.  Enjoy the story line.  Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fictional adventure.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best sic-fi series I've seen, it is a shame that they canceled it, but the few episodes here mixed with the movie are worth it!
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|so good I got this album after amazon recommended it to me. Took a risk, and the risk paid off. Great album, totally chill, beautiful music.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book should be rated R - Triple XXX.  If you can handle the very descriptive acts in the book, then it's a good read.  The characters are interesting and it keeps you intrigued.  I can't wait to finish all three books to see what happens in the end.
B001A3CP5Y|5.0|All this talent in one place coud have been a contest of egos and not worked. HOWEVER, it does work, wonderfully, as ithis CD demonstrates.They said they had a lot of fun sharing and making this CD,  which I found, lyrically (dirty world) and muicaly/cryptically  \\"end of the line\\" to be true. I love having  their gifts, talent and fun all in the same place at the same time on one sweet recording.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I never rate apps but I love this one so much I wanted to give it a g ood review. It is fabulous. I come back to it again and again.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It a fast kindle fire changer with in minutes you can be change up and ready to go on your way

B0047WJ12K|5.0|And I'm still wondering if he was awake or asleep? I've seen the movie twice now and I'll probably end up buying it.
B000FC10MU|5.0|I have been curious about trying a Gaiman novel for some time.  I enjoyed his other work in graphic novels and in movies and such, in the past. This was my first pick for sampling his fiction in another medium and I am happy I did!  He is creative and generous in his description of the characters and worlds he creates. I am going to read more!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Having spent many years flying in Air Force Special Operations Command, I had the honor of working side by side with many of the men that served in NSW and DEVGRU.  I found this account of selection, training, and deployment to be a great read and a true glimpse of the lives of these special operators.
B009YU9J0E|4.0|Definitely a dark album but I love all that is Crystal Castles.  Sometimes I just imagine dark horses and unicorns speeding through space and time throughout the universe...especially to previous album tracks such as &#34;Violent Dreams&#34;.  I feel with each album Crystal Castles has had more clarification as to how they want the album to be themed and how they want that specific sound to come across.  I would akin &#34;(III)&#34; to a more danceable Zola Jesus record or rather a sound similar to Zola Jesus in terms of vocals and more danceable.  I feel that &#34;(III)&#34; captures more of the true darker essence that Crystal Castles really tries to emanate.<br /><br />Maybe what I'm feeling is that it's capturing a darker place inside Alice Glass that we have yet to see or understand.  Having seen CC live, I always felt that there was something darker to her than the surface.  I recommend to just buy the whole album, play it the whole way through and see where it takes you.  Not my favorite tracks by CC on this album but this is the only CC album I can honestly listen to the entire way through without wanting to skip a single song.  Over all, I enjoyed this album very much.  My favorite tracks on &#34;(III)&#34; include, &#34;Sad Eyes&#34;, &#34;Mercenary&#34;, and &#34;Transgender&#34;.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|Don't listen to all the people that say you need to log in to a FaceBook account to use this App, those people do not know what they're talking about. You do not even need a FB account to use this app. The app merely states that you can link it to FaceBook so you can share what you're watching with your FB Friends. I don't have a FB account and it works just fine.<br /><br />The App itself is good. It found my WDTV Live Media Player and also my Yamaha Receiver with no problems. There is a bit of a learning curve in order to figure out how to stream on to those devices but it isn't too hard to figure out.<br /><br />I like using the YouTube feature because it is much easier to use the keyboard on my phone to enter text opposed to the clunky way the WDTV player has you do.<br /><br />I don't like the lag. It sometimes takes about 15-25 seconds before the video will start playing on my TV, If the app didn't lag so much I would give it a better rating.
159413586X|5.0|My daughter loved it.  She is reading it now, and cannot wait to finish it.  Thank you very very much
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game on my kindle fire! I can't stop playing it. I think that it's a lot better than temple run and the world tour thing that they have now is awesome!!! The best part is that it's free!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Such a great book! It's amazing how close HBO has stayed to original content for the show. I can't wait to get to the next one.
B003MC5AV2|4.0|It was simple read but I actually enjoyed it. It was a cute story that reminded me of high school days......
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best. . You can upgrade it. I know10 friends that have it and love it.<br />The only thing is when you swipe it it does not alwes take it BUT i still<br /><br />  LOVE IT
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great and fun and exciting game. A fun way to test your reflexes and a cool and hip game to play challenging your friends an  family.

B004FOA84A|3.0|Super short!!!!! The Lost city is better, The Lost city is better, The Lost city is better, The Lost city is better, The Lost city is better!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|After the first couple of chapters, I could not put this book down, and its been a long while since I have read a book that was this compelling.  There are a lot of unexpected twists and turns.  I really could not predict what was going to happen next.  I am in a book club and I believe this has been everyone's favorite book so far.  Unfortunately I did not get the fairy tale end that I wanted.  But then again, the ending was unexpected, so I had to keep reading to find out how everything was going to develop.  I am hoping she is setting her fans up for a sequel and would LOVE to see this book made into a movie.
B000CNFC76|5.0|This is a wonderful true story, and if you enjoy golf it's a must have and see movie, the actors make you feel like you're back in the early 1900's with them, each character gets into their role , whether your young Francis or the older version.<br /><br />The parts of Harry Vardon, and the older Francis Ouimet, played by Shia LaBeouf both played their parts to pefection, but the character I enjoyed the most was the 10 year old spunky caddie Eddie,  it's a truly enjoyable story, and most golfers should enjoy it, and I reccomend it.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Being deployed the only thing rougher than the enemy is the boredom. Thankfully our exchange sold this piece of equipment. I had thoughts about it at first but its hard plastic is strong and protective. it can carry the system, wires, 2 controllers, 2-3 games nice and snug without the equipment rocking back and forth. The tv is a decent size, as well as the case. Where we got lucky we got beds and this can share the bed with me and still be able to play for hours comfortably. Its best played in a spot where you can be about 2-3 feet from the screen (most games) but managable from farther. This piece of equipment is probably the best investment iv made in awhile and where as i am a PC gamer at home its been nice to catch up on well missed 360 games.
B0051U6TIQ|3.0|The album is good but it's censored.  Why would you a censored album and not tell someone it is censored. Otherwise the album is great!
B004856SQ8|5.0|love this movie,<br />The A-Team follows the exciting and daring exploits of a colorful team of former Special Forces soldiers who were set up for a crime they did not commit. Going &#34;rogue&#34;, they utilize their unique talents to try and clear their names and find the true culprit
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love how dark and detail oriented this game is. It's not my favorite adventure game but it's definitely one of my favorites. It's great for adults and I really like the ability to adjust the difficulty level on it.
B006LXQID8|4.0|I only watched this because my lady friend watched it. I was initially reluctant to watch a subtitled movie but it turned out to have a great little story. I kinda fell in love with the character and actress for her cuteness in this movie.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Loved it!  I've seen the movie 4 times. It's like watching my favorite musical up front and personal. I didn't appreciate the CD until I saw the singing-while-acting in the movie. Now I love the CD.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was written well with an interesting story line along with in depth character portrayal. I enjoyed reading this book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can read now when waiting for anything. I get a lot of free books and have many to choose from.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|love this movie,<br />an epic-scale action-adventure that unfolds across the seas, in the skies and over land as our planet fights for survival against a superior force. An international naval coalition becomes the world's last hope for survival as they engage a hostile alien force of unimaginable strength. Ripping across sea, sky and land

B00AKOB7CG|1.0|This app isn't working on my Kindle Fire HD. I'm pretty bummed. It will open to the main page, but when I select to start, I get nothing but a black screen.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I enjoy playing this game.  It very challenging for me and my daughters they enjoy playing as well. I play so much I feel like I'm addicted in the morning afternoon and at night.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is SO much better then the first Temple Run. It takes a little time to get used to the new look but it is way worth it. PERFECT.
1423136802|5.0|These books have been out for a while and I never seemed to get into them. I'm a teacher and wanted a quick read over break. I couldn't have been happier after I finished the first book. The writing is certainly geared for the age group, but the story can be enjoyed by all. The box set was perfect for the price and convenience. Once you read the first one, you'll want the others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Voll cool<br />Mein absolutes Lieblingsspiel !!!!!!!!!!<br />Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen.<br /><br />Die Grafik ist auch total Klasse.<br />I like it.<br />Finde es auserdem cool dass man sich neue Figuren erspielen kann.

B002RVCD6O|2.0|This is the worst of the eight Harry Potter movies. It diverged from the book too much and added items not found in the book. It was disjointed and hard to follow the story line even when I've read the books several times. I would not recommend this movie to Harry Potter lovers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game!<br />I really enjoy wasting my time with this game. You think quickly as the game progresses<br />My kids love this game

0385344228|4.0|This book starts off really strong. I'm a huge \\"real crime\\" fan. I enjoy 48 Hours, Forensic Files, Law & Order, Dexter, and those types of things. Because of this, I'm familiar with the start of the book, as far as the DA and his job description, the law enforcement protocol, etc. It reads as if it's a CSI episode setting the scene during the first half of the show. You're interested to keep reading more to understand the key characters and gather all the clues and information so you can start to form ideas in your head about \\"whodunit.\\"<br /><br />The trial part of the book does lull a bit. It took me two weeks to read this book and I set it down the most during these chapters. Although, the random transcripts in a different type face do start to pique your curiosity. Why is he answering questions about privileged information? Why are they showing questions about parts of the trial that have been passed by?<br /><br />Near the end of the book is where it is really at it's prime, in my personal opinion. More than the other parts, you are really absorbed into the story and feeling these characters, their emotions, and how this is going to end. Can life go back to usual? Do they find a way to make it work? Then, shocking twists that literally made me gasp aloud. I'm *so* glad I read this book with no previous knowledge of it, no review reading, no discussions with a friend that had read it. Then, I would have expected a twist, and it would have changed my experience. I went into this blindly and honestly thought the book was winding down to a nice, neat ending and resolution.<br /><br />I do think the plot stumbles a bit, but I still highly recommend this book. Within minutes of finishing it, I already started to tell my husband \\"you HAVE to read it.\\"
B000002J1M|5.0|By 1972, progressive rock was in full swing. Jethro Tull had come out with their full-album masterpiece, Thick as a Brick. Yes had proved themselves to be quite the innovators with albums like The Yes Album, Fragile, and Close To The Edge. Emerson Lake and Palmer gave us Tarkus. Pink Floyd had put out weird albums such as Ummagumma and Meddle. So, naturally, it was time for Genesis to step up their game and deliver something truly remarkable. Trespass was a decent beginning into the realm of prog, though it was a tad bit uneven and directionless. Nursery Cryme was where the band started to gel, but there were a few too many duds, turning the album from a masterpiece into just a really good album.<br /><br />Then they released Foxtrot, the first fully cohesive album by the band. This is really the best place to start if you want to get into the artistic side of this band. Everyone is firing on four cylinders. Steve Hackett is playing some of the best guitar in his life, Tony Banks is absolutely mesmerizing on piano, guitar, and mellotron. Mike Rutherford is showing off all of his skills on bass and 12 string guitar, and Peter Gabriel....what else needs to be said?<br /><br />The album begins with one of the most majestic and bombastic openers of all time, Watcher Of The Skies. If there ever was a song to describe what 70's Genesis was like, this is it. Powerful keyboards, a tricky time signature, frantic performing, and of course, the awesome vocal range and theatrics of Peter Gabriel. At this point, Peter really shines out as the insane energetic frontman to this weird band. One of the most powerful songs in the band's career.<br /><br />The band also starts to show that they can write shorter songs as well. Time Table ends up being a catchy powerful ditty with some very soulful singing, and the epic Can Utility and the Coastliners also proves that a lot can be said in 5 minutes.<br /><br />Get Em Out By Friday is a strange one. A song about the greed of slumlords and a strange future where people can't be over 4 feet tall, it is a frantic evolving number with some incredible social commentary. People still get screwed over when it comes to rent. Looks like you can still resonate with this one today.<br /><br />And of course, what hasn't already been said about Supper's Ready? The magnum opus of Genesis, this song is Shakespeare and Mozart set to rock music. A driving 25-minute piece about the apocalypse, this ever changing piece never gets old. Everything is there for a reason. The beautiful acoustic guitars, the rush of keyboards and clashing electric guitar, the insanity of Willow's Farm, and of course, the majesty of the finale. It's a grand piece that needs to be heard.<br /><br />Genesis' mastery begins with this album. Buy it today.nd a strange future where people can't be over 4 feet tall, it is a frantic evolving number with some incredible social commentary. People still get screwed over when it comes to rent.

B00A11AN6O|5.0|Ease of use describes this product.  And get the cloud app for android smartphones.  The Amazon cloud allows you to upload documents, pictures, videos and MP3's.  Best cloud out there.  And making it free, makes me trust Amazon more and more to be updated on the newest and most helpful technology out there.  Kudos Amazon..
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Sounds perfect and its great music. There was no problem with the download, it downloads directly to your itunes library and then to your phone. The booklet tells you all the somg's lyrics.
1616550414|5.0|First off, yeah, amazon shipping is awful. I say that because the rather large box holding my copy had very little cushion, by that I mean three of those large air-filled bags. I'm surprised my copy came in so perfectly, especially since I hadn't been able to receive on the 29th when it came to me. But alas, that's not really the book's fault.<br /><br />The book itself is beautiful on the outside alone. It took my breath away when I saw it. Not only is it in my favorite color but the embossing was perfect.<br />Next, as I have yet to fully read it, I'm doing a brief review from my flipping through of it (of course I did this immediately after opening the package) and of what I've read.<br />As many people the abundance of Skyward Sword was noted, however I didn't mind that at all as through playing the game I've already known how strongly important the title is for Hyrule's timeline. I also found it to be a very moving title in terms of game-play and as with other titles found myself infatuated with the characters. When I ordered I literally had no clue of the manga in the back, so that was a surprise for me, which I'm excited to get to that point. And compared to art books of other games my roommate has collected I feel like this is more true to the fact that it is a collector's item.<br />From what I've read I've understood the large portion from Skyward Sword, and I've also found myself imagining the game with some of the drafted characters, like the potion shop twins. I love every detail of what I've read, the only complaint is the mentioning of rumors, without confirming or dismissing, I'm pretty sure they mention the spirit in TP being rumored to be Link from one of the Ocarina of Time Links, but if that's my only issue I'm just going to assume the mention of the rumor means it's true, because it's my imagination.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well. I love to play this game . It s very fun game compare to temple run. Great for killing time
B00B2V66VS|5.0|As weird as it sounds, this game makes me please smile. Me and my mom compete for higher scores. I'm kicking her butt.
193609648X|5.0|It's the shawl on the cover that caught my imagination.  I now have the book, the hook and the yarn.....oh my!  It's time to get down to business.  Hahaha!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Not sure if you need the cloud, then you get this, as that is the way I did it.  But the MP3 uploader works fine.  It also searches Amazon for information about each MP3 as they are being uploaded.  And I'm sure they covered every file type know.  Amazon again keeps you up to date with the latest tech.  It's ease of operation is quite simple.  If you want things more complicated here, look elsewhere.  It's perfect for everyone from 8 to 80.  Excellent product.
B007W7P5L8|3.0|For $30 I expected a better quality product.  The quality is worth about $10.  I have had the cover for about 2 weeks and does the job, but it doesn't always close precisely - meaning i have to kind of move it over a bit after closing it to make sure it covers the whole device.  Unfortunately, I looked around A LOT and couldn't find anything less expensive that I liked.  We will see how long it lasts...
0765325950|3.0|This book is a huge departure from the rest of the series.  It is focused almost solely on the battle, which is decent, but it could have been a bit more balanced with character driven developments.<br /><br />A lot of reviewers are frustrated that so many of Jordan's story lines, are left unresolved.  That's perfectly understandable, but Jordan continued to introduce new characters and story lines book after book for 20 years, along with a detailed description of their wardrobe choices, at the expense of moving the story along.<br /><br />In Sanderson's first two contributions, he did a good job of converging or resolving what he could, but it was time to wrap things up, minor side plots be damned.  From the beginning it has been clear that Rand, Mat and Perrin were the central figures in the last battle, and so, only they are really followed in depth in this book as everything converges on Rand's showdown with the dark one.  The problem is that there is so much action to that even they are not well developed, sure they do a lot, they accept their fates and stop fighting their destinies, but the why takes a backseat to the action.<br /><br />My biggest issue with the book, is that it is several hundred pages of epic battles, then *poof* it's resolved. Over.  Done.  Wait, what?  The lead in was too long and the resolution too short, and too unexplained.  I still don't understand how Rand won the battle with the dark one, or how he ended up as he did at the end of the battle.<br /><br />Overall, if you've stuck with the series these 23 years, it's worth the read.  It might be the least of Sanderson's contributions, but it's far from the worst book in the series.  The middle volumes where the main characters start and end in the same place, where most of the dialogue is women complaining about men (or vice verse, where half the text is described garish wardrobes, and what's left is Jordan introducing new side characters and subplots; those were the ones that challenged a readers loyalty.<br /><br />The book is OK, the series was OK, In the best of all possible worlds, this would be a 6 or 8 book series with no mention of wardrobe!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Thevgame is excellent the best $7.00 dollars I ever spent. But on the minecraft aiming the update pocket edition (pe) is suppose. to come out on Jan 30 2013.  But it still is the same.

B0007MAJBQ|5.0|These mini discs dubbed well with only minor skipping which I feel was caused by my player's laser being towards the end of it's life. My supplier Tadahiro from Japan Import  was prompt with delivery and even put in a little origami gift, very nice thanks. Arigatou gozaimasu.
1616550414|5.0|I was so excited when I got this.  I am a huge Zelda fan and I can't wait to just sit down and read it all.  I flipped through it and it has a ton of information and a lot of cool facts about the games!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one of the best games in the world. It is a lot better than the original TEMPLE RUN and that's saying something because that's a good game. I hope you buy all the TEMPLE RUNS.
B009MO57H6|4.0|I enjoyed this product quite a bit as well and the additional download that came with it it is a great buy
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I am a fan of Christmas books and Charles Dickens and A Christmas Carol is a really good book. I got  the book for a good price. I recommend the book and author. It is pretty easy to read on my iPhone 5. I bought it from Kindle app and it downloaded pretty fast.
B0091REZMW|4.0|although this is my 3rd time having 2 reinstall &amp; start all the way from the beginning. that sucks. but 1st time was cause of the game,  this time is due 2 my kindle. &amp; last time I did a lot better 2nd time around.  so this time I'm sure my strategy will b even better. BEST PART IS THIS APP IS FREE!!!!! IVE SPENT A TOTAL OF $6.00 ON THIS GAME 4 DIAMONDS &amp; THAT WAS 3 DIFFERENT TRANSACTIONS OF ONLY $1.99 : BUT I WAITED 4 THE SPECIALS WHERE U GET DOUBLE THE DIAMONDS...
B008I43DYU|3.0|I think this App does everything it's supposed to but it is not very helpful to me.<br /><br />What I really didn't care for is that right after making this minor $.99 purchase, another App appeared for an HP financial and scientific calulator that would suit my needs very well. The desired calculator is about $5+ and while $.99 is nothing to get excited about, it's annoying to not have access to the desired product until after I purchased one that is only a so - so. I went to the Manage Kindle Content and found, the unnecessary App can't be returned for a refund. OK, not earth shattering but also unnecessary. I tried to return it in less than 3hrs of getting it. So now the price of the desired App goes up by a buck or, 17%. As I said, this is not a major issue but why not show all the calculators, or any other group of Apps being searched, instead of showing only the low end of the product line.<br /><br />I would suggest people seeking Apps search on the general topic. Obviously, there are more Apps then appear on the App Store line at the bottom of your display.
1608871088|5.0|What a nice book... they share the map of their pipeline, the characteristic every character, but i wish they could share the wire of the character 3D model...
B008MMFCAG|5.0|Privateering picks up right where Get Luck left off!  Mark Knopfler is a master story teller.  His songs together with the musical arrangements paint wonderful images.  This double CD set is definitely worth the three year wait since the release of Get Lucky.  You can't go wrong purchasing Privateering.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great!!  I love this game! Everything is so detailed and fun!! I can't wait to play more! I love it so much!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I downloaded this app because I had liked the first one.  While I would like to give this game a 5 star review, I am going to give it 3 stars because of a lagging issue with the game (I play this game on the Galaxy S3).  It seems that after you acquire more then half the upgrades the game will start lagging and not registering your finger swipes and other input. I've looked this up on forums and it seems like it happens a lot on users who play on the S3's, and it also happened to me on the first one. If this fix this issue then this game would be a 5 star for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game kids loVe it even me. It helps u understand what they can learn.<br />And u may never know when u become 1st .
B0063IH60K|5.0|A simple ad at start, but nothing annoying. Great little game while sitting in the doctor's office. It is best of the free solitaire games for smartphones and tablets.

1432794426|5.0|I read Karen Moriarty's book about Michael Jackson \\"Defending a King\\" hoping to perhaps learn a little more about what happened to him. I had done some independent research into his life on impulse after he had passed away and what started as an inquiry turned out to be a three year mission.<br /><br />Karen's book was invaluable to me because the more I read through it, the more I kept finding information I missed. Karen's accounts from Michael body guards, some of his employees and his 2005 Trial lawyer, Tom Mesereau not only humanized Michael but also mystified him at the same time.<br /><br />Ultimately what I learned about Michael from Ms. Moriarty's book was that Michael Jackson was not just a celebrity.<br /><br />\\"Defending a King\\" taught me how to read a book \\"between the lines\\" and read a human being \\"between the perceptions\\".<br /><br />If there was ever a person in modern history that deserved to be credited for using Christ as a role model, Michael Jackson's childlike sincerity in his efforts are highlighted in \\"Defending a King\\". It is an amazing read if you would TRULY like to get to know the man at his core.<br /><br />Being a researcher myself, there were times where I was frustrated with what Ms. Moriarty reports in the story of Michael, however, I understood that Moriarty reported on what she heard from fans of Michael and friends alike.  I believe the book to be well written, indiscriminately researched and brought me closer to understanding Michael Jackson and his true character.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game I am so addicted to this app. I love subway surfers and I hope u do to. It is SUPER awesomelisheness

B008B92U32|3.0|I got thiis app for the perpose of reviewing it only. I don't take many pictures so it's not somthing I'll keep. I gave it 3 stars because sometimes the picture gets distored when you swap them. If you're the type of person that takes a lot of photos with other people and you like making them funny by editing them then this could be something you would use. I sertainly won't be using it. Thanks for reading &amp; I hope this helps you decide if you want to ownload it.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I love the Reacher series by Lee  Child, bad news is &#34; I have already read the book &#34;.  Shucks

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got it for my 7 yr old and she she breezed through most levels and had fun with easy and hard puzzles. Then my 4 yr old tried it and he got into it too, and after I showed him how to do the first one, he did a bunch himself. Even I liked it.
B000LJB9U0|4.0|I think it is a good movie, but it is very predictable. Mr. Walken is a very good actor as it goes for Natile Wood is one of her last or last movie before her passing. She was a great actor as well as very good looking.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I love this series and would like to see more like it. The quality is superb and the acting is perfect,however I do not care to see homosexual behavior treated as the norm. I realize this behavior is out there but it is not nearly as prevalent as some in society would have us believe. I do not hate anyone but homosexual behavior is a perversion of GOD'S intent for sex.<br />I believe there is a huge market for the edited version of this series and I for one would purchase it in a heartbeat. The PBS edited version is the one I would love to purchase.<br /><br />Roy
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|If this were a Hollywood movie nobody would believe it, but at the age of 71, with Til Your River Runs Dry, Eric Burdon may have made the best album of his storied career. I know many of you won't believe the hype I'm putting out there, but all I can say is, \\"Give it a listen and then get back to me.\\"  By the way, I'm 61 years old and have been a fan since I was a teenager. I know there are a lot of old, and perhaps some young, fans out there who are going to be blown away by this.  I don't really see the point in reviewing the songs one by one, they are all good and Eric has a first class band backing him up.  I really just want everyone to know how great I think this album is, and I don't use the word \\"great\\" lightly.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I have sympathy for all characters involved but I felt if I wasn't 27, it might have been more interesting.  Pretty bummed I skipped studying accounting for this.

B0013N3DSE|5.0|I am a huge Robin Hood fan at age 26, and even though the old days of Robin Hood are a tad to happy, it is still very well acted and exciting. W/ Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone two great actors of that era. I am happy with this product.

B0049985XW|5.0|This is a sentimental movie for me as I saw it with my Dad as a young girl.  Bogart, Holt, Huston go prospecting for gold in the mountains and do a pretty good job of finding the gold.  But, it came to the point where Bogart, a little unhinged, became obsessed with  one of the others stealing his goods and does away with Holt.  Houston is sought by one of the mountain tribes to care for one of their sick children and he stays with them.  Bogart makes way with all the shares of gold and just as he is in reach of safety, the mexican bandits rob and kill him but not for the gold.  As they strip him of his clothes, shoes, the stomp the bags of gold and it blows away with the sand.  Boggie did a good job of being a little touched in the head.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a great tool to have on your Kindle.  You know exactly how much time you have left before recharging.

B006FE83UE|5.0|The one and only book of Harper Lee and written as a childrens book centers around Attica Finch, a lawyer, defending a black man and his two children, Scout and Jim, who are very much interested and afraid of Bood Radley who lives next door and leaves small gifts in a tree hole for Jim.  Coming home from a school festival, the two were attacked but was saved by Boo.  Good book and an even greater movie.  Gregory Peck won an Oscar for his role in this movie.\<br />A must see or a great collectable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This review is kinda ok and stuff I don't why thoand some other stuff but the game is very nice
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Very helpful. I use this notepad for when i attend church. It is very easy to use. I use it all the time. I highly recommend it to people who takes notes all the time and wrights on everything and ends up losing there papers. This would really benefit them in every way.
8866130931|5.0|i will continue buying one of these every year until the day i die. i prefer the soft cover because it doesn't feel so bulky in my purse. i love the note page on the side of each week. great for to-do lists and notes.
B00B0ND67K|5.0|This album offers a pop/rock/country vibe with a hint of folk. The group's ability to seamlessly blend three unique voices/styles and create such an outstanding, consistent product surprised me. You will come away wanting to hear the vast majority of the songs again and wondering whether or not these three have been secretly playing together for decades.<br /><br />\\"Finally Home\\" is a tremendous opening piece, perfectly showcasing the skills of all three band members.  \\"Just Say Yes\\" represents what I've always liked about Kenny Loggins.  It is an optimistic, upbeat, uplifting rock tune with great hooks...the type of song you want to play over and over.  Georgia's vocal depth shines on \\"Little Victories\\" and Gary's \\"A Thousand Wild Horses\\" is very well performed and written.  The depth of the album is impressive as well featuring impressive works throughout such as \\"Brave\\" and the playful \\"You're Not the Boss of Me.\\"  Very, very solid effort!!!
B008MZU8R0|5.0|Clockwork Angels confirms the relevance and talent from the Canadian based trio.  I personally have not missed a concert since Moving Pictures and don't intend on ever letting the hundreds of original tracks out of my music rotation.  There are some artists that you just buy the CD.  Rush is one of those!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you are a kid or adult subway surfers is the game for you and you even get upgrades but the best thing is that you can connect with your Facebook and play with your friends. Now get it play it and write me back  and  tell me if you love it or hate it .I know your love it. I'm KZ<br /> and that's that's my review
B006LSZECO|3.0|Ending left me a little disappointed. Wasn't what I thought. Maybe I just didn't get it... hopefully, the movie version is better.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. The twists and turns and shocking moments. I tried to predict what would happen, think of the most impossible twist and yet I was surprised at what happened next. I was in suspense the entire book. Phenomenal.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR.  SUPERLATIVE ACTING, TOUT DIRECTION,  DELICATLY PACED , VERY DISCERNING  AND IMFORMATIVE.<br /><br />RESTORES MY FAITH IN CONTEMPORARY MOVIE MAKING.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is AWESOME!!!!!! I love it! I love that giant thing that chacing you and tries to grab you.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book. There is so much good to say about it. I will keep it brief, because I am writing it from my kindle, and as much as I love my reader, typing this is sucking pretty bad already. Here goes... George/Jake was such a great person, as was Sadie.  The other supporting characters were wonderful, too. I thought the players were made rich and full without dragging out their development. The description of the life George created for himself in Jodie was interesting and fun to read. The small details such as the World Series and the boxing match brought a sense of reality to the story.  His involvement in the town and how they came to embrace him added such a pleasant feel to a pretty intense story.  The relationship between George and Sadie was so nice. Having George find the love of his life while trying to right what he perceived to be a serious wrong was a fantastic speed bump in his plan. Time travel from Stephen King' s unique view was a treat. Learning the consequences of meddling with history is always an intriguing idea. This book could make a great movie, in the same way as Shawshank and The Green Mile. I am sorry I am done with it. By the way, I would love to read the alternate ending written by Joe Hill.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an awesome.game! It's never gets old I was addicted to temple run and then my friend told about this game and I haven't stopped playing this ever since! Even my 5 year old sister plays!also my 9 year old sister plays this game! Well that's all for now byeeee!!!!

0894803123|4.0|got this book for xmas. basic recipes. book wasnt as exciting as i thought it would be. recipes are very basic and uncooked. easy to make, but too sweet for me, but some family members liked it. it seems like basic vanilla and chocolate recipes then just add extra junk to it. no special flavors. boring.
0061733199|5.0|I have read several survival books. Most are filled with conspiracy theories and wild ideas about the coming apocalypse. This is truly a guide to survive in any situation. it is extremely easy to navigate and find tops of interest. This book has wonderful informative illustrations that will shoe in detail how to survive in any situation.

Once again, THIS IS THE BEST SURVIVAL GUIDE AVAILABLE!!
B004UJAOLM|4.0|It was  hard for me to get through this entire book, and I hated almost all of the characters.  By the end, though, I was  in love with the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I highly recommend playing this game. I personally love to play this game.I am kinda addicted to trying to beat everyone else's score.I get so excited when I beat a score that is higher than mine. If you don't buy this game you are truly missing out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is the best game there is. I think that this is better than the new York version.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book nice ending ready for the next one (maybe) yes, I guess something like catching fire :) I m not a fan of reading
B006PKQQJS|3.0|I purchased this product less than a year ago. Now I have the new Kindle Fire HD but it doesn't work on this tablet. I love the game but I wish there was a way to swap it out for the edition that works for both tablets!
B008F9T76Q|4.0|Only about halfway through the 2nd book but once you pick it up it's hard to put it down! Just as captivating as the hunger games series.
B005974CNA|5.0|Very nice!  The DVD story of their search to find a new drummer was interesting, albeit secondary to my enjoyment of the album.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Need a game to challenge your mind?  Mahjong Deluxe does just that. It's not a difficult game so any age range can play this. True some of the symbols are similar, but that's part of the challenge. Try it....you'll enjoy it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun game in which you must move your way through a maze/path.I love the apeed of the game
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is overall pretty damn good. Carbide and Ceramic sharpener work very well as does the diamond rod. Very sharp edges very fast. Get it. Lightweight, strong, fast.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was so clever- it is poignantly and realistically written. I can't believe I was lucky enough to find it to read. THANK YOU Jonathan Green!
B009H442DG|5.0|I liked hearing the two together plus I like Olivia and John.This cd was a perfect Christmas gift for anyone that liked these two together.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Such a great book.  Love the author!  Would read many more of Gregory Roberts books in the future!  Exciting and was sorryit ended.
1594487154|5.0|This book is a fresh and creative take on what selling really is.  Daniel Pink makes great use of wide-ranging examples and sources to support his arguments.  It's an engaging read due to the many stories and real-life examples that he uses.  This book is a must-read for virtually anyone that needs to persuade, motivate, or &#34;move&#34; other people.  This is not just about business or traditional sales, it's about tapping into the human element of what truly enables success in all aspects of life.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's totally worth buying  it's so flooding addicting my fat grandma love it so it must no it's videos rally get it
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is a good game, but it is a little confusing to play, not to mention a little hard to control. The controls don't always work. Sometimes I try to roll, but it just turns me.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is awesome. I fall asleep to my own custom mix every night. I love the customizations available on it.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I received this book as a shower gift for my son.  I cried the first time I read it and I still cry 7 years later.  This book really touches my heart.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|loved it! First piece I read by Oscar Wilde and it did not disappoint me! A great tale on the tragedy of youth
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved the original temple run and I love this one too. My only complaint I is that it sometimes crashes when I press save me, taking my gem and restarting the game without recording any progress. Other than that, fantastic!
B005LAII1C|5.0|My son loved it. However, he said it was a little rauchy and not for everyone to view.  He particularly liked the digital feature.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This \\"pipes\\" -like game is great!!! I love it's challenge and simplistic graphics. I only wish that there was a way to link amazon and apple products... Thats the only downfall.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its so awesome that sometimes I can't get off of it! My niece and nephews keep on asking me if they can play and I say no because I'm on I'm on it then they call me mean then tell on me, what brats!!!!:(
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Fun to watch...did a montage of the Mayan end of the world with three movies, 2012 and deep impact. This was the most exciting of the three
B008ASGP3U|5.0|As usual, Ian Rankin spins a convincing tale. His protagonist, Rebus, is retired, but helping the Edinburgh Police with old unsolved cases.by chance, he is approached by a woman whose daughter is missing but has noticed reports of other missing girls from the same location..Needless to say, Rebus manages to worm his way into this live case.<br />The story has logical progress, withRankin's skill in describing Scotland, his homeland, amazingly accurate in both physical location and also atmosphere.<br />Rankin has been a favorite of mine since I read his first Rebus novel, set in Edinburgh.<br />His skill is acknowledged in the U.K., sadly less so here.<br />Anyone who loves a good mystery can do no better than to read Rankin....in order, if possible.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's like my computer but I can take it everywhere. It's the best $7.00 I ever spent. BUY IT YOU'LL LOVE IT.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It's a good story and it left me feeling more connected with the power that creates the universe.  The technical information supports Dr. Alexander's experience.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Loaded this to my new Kindle Fire HD 7 and found it fascinating to see visual representations of the wifi channels available. I live on a boat and our marina had signal problems recently. I shared this app with the wifi service technician who came here, he was impressed. I'm a technician myself. Tremendous geek factor, gives spectrum views you would otherwise need a very expensive instrument to see.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|Fun to watch...did a montage of the Mayan end of the world with three movies, 2012 and day after tomorrow
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a very fun app. its good for parents and kids. I really love this game because I really love horses so much. if u love horses then its a good game for u to play.
