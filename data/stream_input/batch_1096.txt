0385341679|5.0|This final book in the Fever series did not disappoint.  I almost was afraid to start, worried it would disappoinet.  I am so glad that it turned out  better than I could have hoped. Read the first four and then treasure having questions answered.  I also appreciate that there is more to learn about this world because it means future books.

0399246665|5.0|I don't know about you, but I remember opening up Eric Carle's books and lighting up with joy as I flipped through the pages. When I was a child, my school would often bring in different books of his, and our teacher would let us read them or he/she would read to us. The colorful pictures and variety of animals, shapes, objects, drawings, etc., you can't be disappointed as a kid. All the things that kids love are in his books. I bought Eric's book sets because of my past memories and fondness with them. As of now, I often use them when I teach to children from the ages of 3-6. In my classes, the books are always a big hit. The children smile when they see the pages turn, and they are able to easily remember the alphabet, shapes, colors, numbers, and movements, thanks to the colors and creativity of his books. I personally think that everyone who has young ones, or will have young ones, should make this a top priority purchase.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|As an owner of several BBC documentary video titles, I can say that this presentation ranks near the top in the echelon of BBC's video offerings.  The four disk series is sub divided into two or three episodes per disk which is generally divided by biological order (i.e. fish, bird, reptile, mammal, etc.).  Each episode is then followed by a \\"how they filmed it\\" section describing the challenges the film crews went through to get the amazing footage; very similar to what is featured on the Planet Earth series.  The general theme of the series is the idea of how life constantly adapts to it's environment for survival and the results that natural selection plays in each biological order over time.  The presentation does not bog down into the scientific intricacies of the process or the explanation, but rather focuses on key, general topics that illustrate the point graphically.  Each episode is narrated by David Attenborough with just enough dialogue to explain what you are seeing but the incredible footage provides the detail.<br /><br />The video quality of this series is absolutely superb.  I do not exaggerate when I say the high definition footage is astounding.  The clarity of the shots and the incredible action captured in the footage is worth the price of the series alone.  This is some of the best blu ray video quality I have seen and it easily surpasses the video quality level of the Planet Earth series in my opinion.  With a DTS sound track the audio is equally impressive to accompany the spectacular video imagery.  This series ranks high in being a title that you will want to re-watch; not only for the content of the narrative, but for the amazing presentation quality of video and sound that is sure to keep any audience in  quiet submission through each episode.  I highly recommend this title as a must have for your video library.

I really liked it laid back good movie to watch with friends.
B001RTSPVY|4.0|I thought the second season of Breaking Bad was really its breakout season.  It continues the story of Walt who is a high school teacher who becomes ill and resorts to selling meth with his dubious partner in order to support his family. In this season, his relationship with his wife Schuyler is challenged, he has a baby on the way (and by the way you won't want to miss that part of the season when it actually happens), and his whole world is almost shaken upside down when he meets a potential new source to unload significant quantities of product.  This show is well worth watching if you haven't started already and I am eagerly anticipating the third season.
B002ZG999U|3.0|Ok I'm kind of split in the middle, while I love the characters and cameos of stars the movie was just ok. The plot was typical which is ok but it could have been more other than the storyline it was an ok film that was still enjoyable to watch.
030746363X|5.0|A whole lot of people have complained in reviews that this isn't anything 'new'; that the diet advice is old, the workouts are old, that all of it is just nothing NEW. These reviews present this in the most critical light possible. These reviews are unfair.<br /><br />So, what are you buying, exactly, with this book? Basically the best collection of ideas and advice on getting in shape and enjoying life, since... I can't think of another book that does it so well, so... Since ever.<br /><br />This book has some controversial materials in it, but in seemingly every place where that stuff appears, there is a user-warning attached. I view the information in this book as safe, unless a moron reads it. Are you a moron? Whatever the answer: OK.<br /><br />I use (parts of) this book in conjunction with a fairly simple workout plan of my own design, and I feel it's a mix that works. Do what you will.<br /><br />For the most part, I use the dietary components of this book; I do, however, use the ab-workout involving the BOSU ball as suggested (I find this ab-workout to be somewhat brilliant and have never seen it elsewhere).<br /><br />The best thing this book does is command you to get off your ass and do something about your situation, regardless of what that situation actually is. It's a call to action, and a lot of people in America need just that...<br /><br />Another aspect of this book that I love, is that it encourages experimentation and the implementation of a scientific approach to one's own body and life. Many won't have the fortitude or objectivity to go through with this, and I fault no one. I don't however, agree with giving bad reviews because I don't agree with a philosophical concept (or by my own limitation, cannot engage it).<br /><br />I believe people, in general, could go much farther in life if they had the dedication to experimentation that Mr. Ferriss proposes.

B000002A3T|3.0|Though it includes three original members, this group of musicians is no substitute for Pink Floyd. They might appear as them in name, but in sound and spirit this is another band, entirely. Pink Floyd was a very particular approach - a very special attitude - that could be sensed, intuited, within every composition. Pink Floyd music was created out of a spirit of defiance. It might have been a reluctance, a fear, a terror of being boring. The Pink Floyd sound was always challenging, always inventive, always extremely creative. You were always being taken on a fantastical voyage, even when things got very nasty between the old boys. This new stand-in group, these impostors, this new imitation has absolutely none of that. This Pink Floyd produces simple songs, but not wondrous magic.<br /><br />On \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" some vestigial Floyd juice had trickled into the mix, there's moments when you can actually hear a trace of their former greatness. Probably was Roger Waters' voice echoing around inside Gilmour's head. But this new \\"Pink\\" was just so limp, so flaccid compared to their might of times yore. There was no fire, no rage, no conviction. They even stoop to plagiarizing themselves with the very lame \\"A New Machine, parts 1 & 2\\". A couple clever sound effects and Gilmour's semi-rigid guitar jabs does not equal Floyd.<br /><br />So on the \\"Division Bell\\" it's even more ridiculous. There's a saying \\"You can't teach an old dog new tricks.\\" Also important to note that you can't teach a dog to fly a rocket. The real Pink Floyd were valiant test pilots on constant missions to the deepest recesses of inner space. This \\"group\\" prefers to not venture any further than the over sized swimming pools in their own back yards. They are floating around on comfy inflatable recliner chairs, sipping gin and tonics and occasionally making sarcastic bitter jokes about the old glory days. It's just way too depressing to bear. Get me my BB gun so I can deflate this tragic pool party.<br /><br />I know that Roger Waters is sorry for the way he behaved all through their messy divorce, and of late has usually been the first of the bunch to consent to any sort of reunion, but Gilmour is still defensive. He is reluctant to tread that old trail, afraid of where it might lead, what it might reveal. He's probably most fearful of finding himself - angry, bitter, sad, and confused. You know, that's likely a good place from which to launch a new band. If they ever manage to mount that expedition, I'm sure it'll have some amazing destinations dialed into the controls.I know that Roger Waters is sorry for the way he behaved all through their messy divorce, and of late has usually been the first of the bunch to consent to any sort of reunion, but Gilmour is still defensive.

0307272702|4.0|I just finished reading the book this evening, but before I share my reasons for buying this book today, I'd like to tell you who I am not, first: I am not an Academic, I'm not a Doctor, I'm not a Biologist, but, I am a Baby Boomer who was awarded with a diagnosis of Type II diabetes about a year ago.     My \\"health educators\\" at Kaiser brought out the five pound lump of fat prop and told me to follow the food pyramid and to eat less and exercise more, patted me on the head pointed me towards the exit.    This evening I wrote to my Kaiser Doctor, asking her to purchase this book, if she hadn't already.    You should buy this book because I believe you will learn that most of the government's information about obesity is wrong.    Gary presents a reasonable explanation that carbs are the cause of our obesity. And this, turns the government's food pyramid on its head.

0375704027|2.0|I wasn't a huge fan of this novel.  I found it to be slow and boring.  It's probably boring because not a lot happens to the main character. He's a loner who is tormented about being in love with someone who doesn't love him.  The only other thing he does is meet psychotic people and sleep with complete strangers.  I know that sounds like a good plot but it's not.  I didn't develop any interest in the book until half way through and then I was just let down by the ending. When I read the ending I threw the book. No Lie. It was so disappointing, it didn't answer any questions and left me confused.    I know it probably sounds like I hated the book but that's not totally true.  Even though I found most of the book to be boring it had its moments.  I think what kept me from hating it completely was the writing style and the characters, who all have interesting pasts.      I would like to warn any readers that are horrified by smutty content that there are a lot of sex scenes.

0385341679|2.0|I've read some of the reviews, and have to say that I agree with the fact that Moning wasted a 100 pages or so by reciting events that had already happened in previous books, or by having Mac give 2 or 3 page long introspection's. After waiting a year and a half for the last book to come out, it became really frustrating for me and I had to fast forward through most of it, because having read the previous books, I came to realize that I recognized most of the complaints and comments by Mac:( Another thing I agreed with from another reviewer was Mac and Barrons relationship and how it went from exchanging a couple of words and glances to I would destroy the world for you, and I just couldn't wrap my head around it. I'm probably frustrated because over these 5 years, after I read each book, I would tell myself that maybe in the next one she would further their relationship or maybe give them a few more scenes or words with each other, but it didn't happen, and then in this last one they just began hating and yelling at each other again, and then all of a sudden they were in love. And forgiving Mac for not getting the spell is another part which I could not wrap my head around, just so un-Barren's like:( So after 5 years, I did get a HEA but it was only 2 chapters long:( And even then, with as another reviewer put it, a domesticly themed ending, which I would never have pictured Mac and Barrons participating in:( Although there were a lot of parts I was disappointed with, I was satisfied with the rest of the book and pleasantly surprised that I didn't have all the answers, and I got my HEA, even though it was lacking.
006016848X|2.0|I agree with the reviewer who stated that there's entirely too much repetition in this book. I felt like I was on a flintsones treadmill going over the same thing over and over and over again. It's frustrating and you want to say \\"GET ON WITH IT!!\\" If only books could hear.    Something that really didn't sit right with me is the fact that he's basically telling women to never ever criticize their man. The only options given are to wait around for a man to ask, or to say it in the most delicate way possible and if that offends his \\"sensitivities\\" then to just apologise for being so critical. Where are these men who can't handle a little bit of criticism? Why am I as a woman forced to sit around and hope that he notices that he has horrible table manners or atrocious social graces? Why is saying \\"this shirt looks better on you\\" such a horrible thing? Why should I be forced to let him drive around for potentially hours to avoid wounding his pride when asking for directions could save time and (gas)money?    Men are similarly cautioned not to give advice when a woman is upset. Evidently this would invalidate her feelings by telling her \\"don't worry\\" or trying to cheer her up by offering a solution to her problem. How exactly is trying to help solve a problem unloving? I seem to sense a pattern of basically \\"just swallow your words and hope for the best\\" in this book.    Overall, the book has a very critical and condescending tone for a book that's supposed to be helpful. This is especially apparent when the women readers are being addressed. Some of the information was useful, but overall it is a rather mediocre guide. I wouldn't recommend taking the words in this book as gospel, but rather a rough guide to understanding the opposite sex.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I'm not much of a writer and the hundred people before me probably did a better job describing why they liked the book.

B002S0OBMS|2.0|The highly touted director, O'Brien, and the choreographer have moved on to a new show in NYC. Love Never Dies has undergone, first, repeated relatively minor changes over a period of months and then, after closing down for four days, major changes. These last changes were brought about by a different director, who has not been credited but is a friend and associate of Lloyd Webber's. There might be further changes for the Australian production. Nothing has been said about LND going to New York for months.     What all of these things add up to is that the characters and story and scenes have been changed enough that the CDs, although they contain the show's main songs, no longer reflect what is going on onstage or what might be going on tomorrow.

B003EYVXUU|5.0|It was with some amount of trepidation that I first heard about the impending release of Let Me In. Like many others, I was quite taken by the original Swedish film, Let the Right One In, which easily secured a spot on my Top 10 of that year. I feared that a remake would only excise the poetic nature of the story in favor of a by-the-numbers vampire film. The attachment of Matt Reeves as writer and director didn't do much to assuage my fears. Cloverfield was entertaining enough for what it was, but its gimmicky shaky-cam aesthetic wasn't very indicative of his directorial abilities. Once the good reviews of the film started pouring in, I figured I'd see it just to say that I did and then forget about its existence shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Could I possibly have been more wrong? I ultimately saw the film five times during its brief theatrical run. It's been three months since then, and I still can't stop thinking about it. Never before has my reaction to a film been so contrary to my preconceived notions. Not only do I prefer the remake, it has fast become one of my all-time favorite films, and Matt Reeves has shot to the top of my \\"directors to watch\\" list. While there is much that can be said for how Let Me In compares to its Swedish counterpart, I'm going to try and keep comparisons to a minimum, because Let Me In stands firmly on its own two feet as a film. The wonderful thing is that one film doesn't have to supplant the other; Let the Right One In is a beautiful film in its own right, and Let Me In is another faithful and unique cinematic take on the same story.<br /><br />The story in question originally comes from the mind of Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist, who wrote the original film as well as the novel that inspired it. The plot revolves around a lonely 12-year-old boy who is bullied mercilessly at school and finds solace in his budding relationship with the girl who lives next door. Unbeknownst to him, the girl also happens to be a blood-thirsty vampire who has been 12-years-old for a very long time. Reeves' adaptation of the material is respectful, thoughtful, and personal. In rendering his version of the story, he draws on the overall structure of the original film, various details from the original novel, as well as some of his own ideas and experiences growing up. Reeves clearly has a firm grasp on the complexities of the material, and he crafts Let Me In as a poignant coming-of-age story, tender love story, and chilling horror story all at once. By thoughtfully transplanting the proceedings to 1980s Regan America, Reeves uses the sociopolitical context of that era as a backdrop for Owen's tortured adolescence, resulting in a subtle exploration of moral ambiguity and duality. Despite its fantastical elements, at its core, Let Me In tackles fundamental human needs - the need to connect, the need to survive, and the need to make sense of a sometimes cold and frightening world. Whereas most modern horror films rely on excessive gore as a substitute for intelligence, Let Me In is one of the select few that brilliantly utilizes its horror premise as a multi-layered metaphor to explore a variety of thought-provoking ideas.<br /><br />While Reeves' screenplay adaptation is impressive in its own right, his directorial style is just as powerful and artistic. Simply put, Let Me In is one of the most elegantly directed horror films I've had the pleasure of watching in a really long time. Reeves' controlled and careful direction is a revelation in today's frenetic cinematic world. Let Me In is one of those rare films where virtually every shot helps reveal character and drive the narrative forward. Reeves is clearly an ardent admirer of Alfred Hitchcock, and his point-of-view driven visual storytelling does an admirable job of cementing the audience in the perspective of the central characters. Furthermore, he injects his film with a sense of dread and tension that would have made the Master of Suspense proud.  Between Reeves' crafted cinematic approach and his cinematographer's haunting gothic visual palette, Let Me In is a breathtaking and beautiful film to behold.<br /><br />Finally, a discussion of Let Me In's strong suits isn't complete without addressing the power of its two lead performances. Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz may have only been 12-years-old at the time of filming, but their performances exude a sense of depth and maturity far beyond their years. Let Me In may revolve around two children, but it is a dark and complex film for adults, and the fact that McPhee and Moretz are able to shoulder the weight of the film with such a sense of grace speaks volumes for their talent as actors. Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas turn in excellent supporting performances, but the central story of Let Me In lives or dies by the success of its two leads, and McPhee and Moretz play a huge part in making Let Me In the emotionally charged film that it is.<br /><br />Although it didn't do nearly as well as it should have at the box office, Let Me In deserves to find a larger audience on DVD and Blu-ray. It's a rare and precious gem that got unfairly swept aside in the chaotic rush of awards season, despite its strong critical reception. In a cinematic climate where countless films are created solely to cash in and make money, it comes as a startling surprise that such a moving, layered, and crafted piece of cinema would come in the form of a remake. And yet, Let Me In is all of these things and more. Anyone who likes their films to have equal doses of artistry, emotion, and intelligence owes it to themselves to pick up a copy of Let Me In. Don't let the genre deter you; it's not just an amazing horror film, it's not just an amazing remake, it's an amazing film, period.

This is one of the best movies of last year and a movie that will be remembered when the Oscars come around. Now an Oscar winner for Best Picture.

B004DTLK8A|4.0|I, like most people, wondered what would happen to Stratovarius after Timo Tolkki left the group in 2008.  I was both surprised and delighted to hear that the group would continue on and just over a year later the album Polaris landed in music stores.  Polaris was met with a lukewarm reception.  It was an improvement over the previous album, the self-titled Stratovarius, but it didn't do enough to convince listeners that the band could prosper without Tolkki.    That worry should be erased with the release of the new album, Elysium.  Here Stratovarius finds the courage to break away from the mold.  Where Polaris tried to play it safe and sound like Stratovarius, Elysium goes its own way and gives the band a new sound.  It is not a radical departure from what fans are used to, but it is effective.      The opening track and first single, \\"Darkest Hours\\" is a good example.  The song is decidedly different from most of Stratovarius' previous works.  The vocal effects harken back to the 80's (be that good or bad, you judge) and the song features some surprising time changes.  \\"Infernal Maze\\" has some of the old school speed and \\"Move the Mountain\\" effectively slows things down at just the right moment.    Of course, most of the talk surrounding the album will be focused on the 18 minutes title track.  It opens with a somber melody that slowly builds as the vocals come in.  The second part of the song is up-tempo with its own chorus, while the third part brings the opening melody back but with a lighter, more optimistic tone.  The songs flows exceptionally well for it's absurd length and ends up being one of Stratovarius' best epics.    As for the musicianship, keyboardist Jens Johansson does nothing to tarnish his reputation though, again, his tones on this album make me think of 80's rock and pop.  Vocalist Timo Kotipelto sounds just as strong as he did in '98 and Jorg Michael and Lauri Porra provide an effective rhythm section.  Guitarist Matias Kupiainen breaks out on this record and proves he can handle the tapping duties once handled by Tolkki.    After a ho-hum release it's refreshing to hear Stratovarius tread new ground.  Elysium is easily the band's best work since Infinite and one I think fans will come to appreciate.  I'm not sure if it's appropriate to call this a come-back album but hopefully it enhances the band's reputation and leads to some extensive touring.
0385341679|5.0|It's so hard to put into words how wonderful this book is! I was a little nervous picking up Shadowfever. Was the beast who I thought it was? If so, how will I handle that? How in the world would Shadowfever live up to my expectations?     I can't believe I even hesitated for even a sec (which is pretty much how long I could hold out, LOL). Ms Moning blew my huge expectations out of the water! I always knew she was a fantastic writer but as I process Shadowfever I can't help but bow down to the mind and skill of Ms. Moning. I think Shadowfever has launched her into another Stratosphere.     Now the question is what in the world can I read next? There is life before Shadowfever and life after Shadowfever. No other book can begin to compare.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My package included both the Firefly series and the movie version, Serenity. I hated to see this series cancelled when it was on TV.  It was both quirky and entertaining with a great cast, many of whom have gone on to other series.  I had also hoped there would be a follow-up to Serenity but no such luck.  This should be a can't miss for sci-fi fans.
0307346617|3.0|\\"World War Z\\" is collection of fictional interviews from people around the world in different phases of the aftermath of the Zombie War. A massive world-scale Zombie infestation at almost destroy mankind.  The book for the most part is fun to read. Sometimes (mostly in the later chapters) become a little slow and unsurprising. I really like a lot the politic criticism and the parallel you can create with the politics nowadays.  Some people claim that the author is not capable of \\"changing the voice\\". It might be true but I think he compensates it with the  good research he did. Some claims or scenarios might be unlikely, but come on, it is a fiction book. If you like zombies and post-apocalyptic fiction this is a must read.  (I heard a Movie is coming soon, it will be as well a nice watch).
B003ITZBVS|4.0|I knew nothing about where these story lines came from until after i saw the film.  So I had no preconceived notions, now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Batman fan, but I've never really been into the comics, i got hooked by the Tim Burton Batman from the late 80s.  So I like Batman when its fairly dark, and or serious, and this film is both. I did look up the Jason Todd story after I saw this, and I'm VERY glad they dropped the Superboy angle, that was just too awkward to swallow.  As for this movie, I loved it, the animation and music were great.  I wasn't too keen on John DiMaggio voicing Joker initially, but he grew on me.  His laugh was creepy! Bruce Greenwood had some serious shoes to fill as I'm a huge Kevin Conroy fan, I grew up watching Batman:TAS. But i think Mr. Greenwood did a great job, and i would be happy to hear him voice Batman again. Overall i think this is one of the best animated Batman films out there thus far.  Hope there are more coming!
1936594293|5.0|Obviously Jane Austen was amazing and Pride and Prejudice is incredible. But WHY would they put this cover on it? Why take a classic and make it look trashy? It looks like Lauren Conrad wrote this book... I am disgusted with the publishers.
1599219751|3.0|I read this book probably 10 years ago, long before there was any news of a movie. I love true-life adventures, and this one was very satisfying--at first. The early parts, about his imprisonment in the Lubianka, his interrogation, and deportation to Siberia were all full of convincing detail. I started being a touch skeptical when he said he and all the other prisoners had to walk through typical Siberian winters (with very low temperatures and strong winds) wearing nothing but shirts and pants. Yes, with no coats, and little, if anything, on their feet. Sorry folks--I think it doesn't matter how strong your will is in this case: you will freeze to death under those conditions, in a very short time. I gave him a pass for just exaggerating a little and kept reading. Nothing much bothered me after that until his \\"escape,\\" so nicely engineered by the commandant's wife. From then on it could only have been fantasy. Crossing the Himalayas with no mountaineering equipment? no cold-weather clothing? and what should they stumble upon but yetis! Not one, mind you, but TWO!    All the same, this is an engaging read, at least for the first half or so. Just don't take it as a true adventure--no amount of good writing will turn this fantasy into truth.

B00005JLD4|5.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence is the touching and poignant story of a fourteen year old girl's trip home after being forcibly removed from her home in 1930's Aboriginal Australia.  Molly and her sister and her cousin were taken by government officials and put into an internment camp for half-castes (people of mixed blood).  The girls escape the camp and manage to elude the police and a native tracker.  They travel almost 1500 miles through Australia along the rabbit-proof fence (a fence put up to prevent rabbits from eating the crops), they even had to make it through a desert.  The Chief Protector of the Aborigines was a truly terrifying man.  He had the power to do anything he wanted and seemed to honestly believe in the racist policies of the office he held.  The policy of removing children from their homes and placing them in these camps continued until 1970.  The children removed are now referred to as the \\"Stolen Generation.\\"<br />  I really felt for the girls.  The mother explains their religion to Molly before she leaves, telling her the bird is the \\"Great Spirit\\" and will always look out for her, and you see Molly looking for that bird throughout the movie.  You watch their mother and grandmother pray for their safe return.<br />  The director did a great job showing the emotions that must have gone through the girls' minds on the trip.  The movie is filled with the beautiful scenery that makes up Australia.  The movie was filled with terrific unknown actors-Molly was unbelievably good.  By the end of the movie, I was exhausted from the girls' harrowing journey.  The end of the movie was my favorite part- we met a couple of the actual girls and heard their story in their own words.  I'm really glad I watched this movie.

I was never bored by it, and Keith (with the help of James Fox) can really tell a great story.

1594202842|4.0|It is a sad fact that such a rich country as America has let its standards slide - particularly with respect to the education of its children. Why are second or even third world countries doing a better job?  Shanghai students are consistently better in high school than American ones; even Polish kids are). The duty to educate the child in all things - ethical and intellectual and emotional - is first the job of the parent, next the job of the school.  The author - a Tiger Mom - understands that it is her job to educate her kids and to raise them for their future challenges.  Many reviews overlook that the author is describing her strengths AND her weaknesses in parenting.  The book is a memoir.  Amy Chua finally comes to understand herself better, to see that she was too tough at the outset.  By the end of the book, she rejects some of her tight controls. But her underlying claim - that she must push her children to the very best that they are capable of - is a true show of love.  I am convinced that her children understand this.  Consider a tough teacher. That person goes through every homework assignment and corrects all the grammatical and spelling errors. The teacher refuses to offer an A on a class paper unless the paper is excellent; the teacher demands the student rewrite and rewrite the paper until it is the best that the student can perform.  Today, that teacher will not be popular.  But 15 or 25 years later, the student may thank that teacher (in his or her heart) for instilling the desire for excellence and recognizing that the student did have the potential and ability to do better.  Let me be frank...I think that Amy Chua was obsessive - compulsive about her children's performance...but parenting is ultimately about love and teaching and preparing one's children for a nasty, unforgiving world.  Her children will excel in their chosen endeavors and will recognize that all the attention that their parents gave to them was a deep form of love.  The TigerMom is the reverse side of Samson's parents in the Bible.  In the Bible story, Samson's father was too permissive and was not going to oppose his (Jewish) child marrying a (Philistine) girl without demonstrating the right amount of parental toughness. In the end, Samson always gravitated towards the wrong women and this resulted in a tragedy for him.  A little more hands on parenting would have done Samson some good and allowed him to use his strengths throughout his life and to exercise better judgment.  I agree with one commentator that spending five or ten minutes with your child every day is not quality time; ignoring your child may be a far greater \\"abuse\\" than spending 10 times more time with your kids to help them perform the best that they can.  Parenting is not an exact science....yes Amy Chua made some harsh mistakes and she acknowledges this. (Denying her kids breaks to go to the restroom is disturbing...if true). Her daughter Lulu's resistance to her mother's methods must also be recognized as a valuable part of Lulu's personality.  No question - it is possible, even advisable, to get the same results with less intensive pressure. And this is Amy Chua's major weakness - I also think that she should have encouraged more play and originality in her children - and that requires flexibility.  Another word on \\"originality.\\"  Amy Chua and her parents were obsessed with forcing their children to bring home A's in every class.  Well, the best student by far in my high school was not the valedictorian but the student with grades just after him.  And some of the papers that I received mediocre marks are the ones which I remember best  - because I was trying to be controversial or original.  I would sacrifice an A to try something new.  Innovation is something that needs to be part of a child's education...too.  And another word on play.  Children do need to enjoy themselves and Amy Chua wants her children practicing music when they should be just having fun.  Learning how to have fun - let's say,  a quiet walk in the woods where one can hear birds or playing board games with other children is a good thing.    Yet one thing is clear to me....her parental desire to forge the skills and respect that her children will need in their future lives is something that all children need more than an easy present of the next updated computer/phone/TV.
1932100660|1.0|I think this book will end up hurting the human struggle, though I do believe Campbell means well, and he is an intelligent man to be sure.  Selective bias works in all of us, including myself certainly, but then I did not write a book stating that any amount of cholesterol is unhealthy in our diets and presenting it as if it were scientifically supported.    I would suggest to all to read Gary Taubes' excellent book \\"Good Calories Bad Calories\\" for a much more scientific and cited discussion of food and human health as it pertains to cholesterol, saturated fat, and their implications in heart disease, diabetes, cancer, etc.  Amazingly well cited, with a 180 page bibliography.      As one who has been into the health movement since I was a little kid, being macrobiotic, vegetarian, vegan, raw-foodist, and now omnivorous, I can say that reading Weston Price's opus titled Nutrition and Physical Degeneration changed my life.  I don't believe there is one human diet, but I must concede that even though initially a vegan diet made me feel great, I now believe firmly that it took me a while to recover from that period of my life, especially from yeast problems and adrenal issues created by all those whole grains and fiber.  High fat diet is the key for me, I definitely know that now.  It seems the original monograph of the china study supports that too, arguably.

B004AHNIGM|5.0|This is an incredible album, the kind that happens when a grizzled veteran finds a spark of creativity that can awaken his passion and find, literally his voice again. In the last years Gregg's voice had sounded ragged on the live stuff I've heard but on this disc he sounds great.  If you like the blues check this one out.
B000SVZIOE|5.0|I watched this with my 6 and 9 year old and we all loved it. Seriously, the over the top lines are funny. The satire on the fat cats running things, making the robots feel not good enough, but having similarities to the auto industry image sell for their bodies. Genius. It keeps it interesting, has all the right laughs, makes adults think a little, inspires kids to be inventors. I highly recommend this movie.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I ate the first two books in this trilogy right up.  I absolutely could not put them down.  So I HAD to find out what happened to Katniss, Peeta, and Gale.  Now I want my $7.51 back.  It's as if she sold the publisher on two parts of a trilogy, and suddenly they demanded the third one a week later.  I can't really explain how else she justifies this weak ending to such an incredible story, that was really building up steam in the first two installments.<br /><br />I really tried to keep my attitude positive for the first half of the book, waiting for some \\"aha\\" moment that never came to explain all of the absurdities in this new storyline.  I would have even settled for the predictable outcome, had I known the book ended like THIS.  (Don't worry; no spoilers follow.)  Instead, not only did it not 'end well', but it ended stupidly at that.  I'm left feeling like I have a band-aid where I should have stitches.

0385341679|5.0|Many other reviewers have discussed the plot and  storyline, so I'm only talking about my feelings about the wrap-up story of this thrilling end to a series..  I usually do not read urban fantasy, so for me to absolutely love this series was a surprise, but I had faith in this author, so I started this series with some trepidation, but ended absolutely loving the entire plot line, characters (and boy were some of them characters! Yikes!) and this series.  Author Karen Marie Moning has a magic touch with every story she's written, and this series did not disappoint due in part to KMM's magic touch, and just plain magic  embedded within each character, and indeed, the new world that she created. I loved the story, the plot kept me up at night reading, and I did not regret being tired the next day.  I highly recommend this group of books to anyone who enjoys fantasy with a dark bent, and anyone who wishes to add a bit of magic to their lives.  The twist and turns never fail to amaze, and my only concern for new readers is be sure to have access to the entire series because when you finish one book, you will want to immediately start on the next.  Each book was a 5 star read because I could not give anything higher..Enjoy, and let me know what you think! Hugs....Susiq2
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|Kiefer Sutherland WAS 24. His character has built up over eight seasons an hour at a time. He is still the determined patriot bent on keeping the USA safe from those who would use our way of life to bring us down to our knees. The supporting cast is top notch and the perfect compliment to Sutherland's character. It is sad to see such a popular series to come to an end, but all things must ... be they good or bad. This is definitely one of those good ones. Better make that one of the Great Ones. For 8 years, Kiefer has kept us entertained wondering what would possible happen next even in the same one hour episode much less the entire season. You can be sure this production is one for the TV and film history books.
0374290024|4.0|As other reviewers have said, this is a fascinating book of world history, especially for the pre-modern era. But a major part of Morris' analysis is his \\"index of social development\\". As he says:<br />\\"The *only* way to answer these questions [relating to why the West rules], I believe, is by measuring social development to produce a graph  that---literally---shows the shape of history.\\"<br /><br />Morris lists four possible objections to his index, but misses what I regard as its greatest methodological flaw, which I will explain. His index is made up of four components (metrics):<br />(a) energy use per capita (in some part of the \\"core\\" of East or West, it would seem)<br />(b) size of largest city, as a proxy for organizational ability<br />(c) military strength, which seems to be measured roughly by ability to kill the enemy<br />(d) information, which is measured by an odd combination of literacy and speed of information transmission.<br /><br />All of these seem reasonable as measures relevant to \\"why the West rules\\". Morris argues that they are all roughly equally relevant, so he adds together these scores, having normalized the maximum global value in the year 2000 CE for each of them to 250 points.<br /><br />Seems reasonable, perhaps? The problem is that (c) and (d) have grown by absurdly large factors since the industrial revolution. Thus for all of history pre-1800 (which is where the question of \\"why the West rules\\" must have its answer), they are completely irrelevant to the total scores. Thus Morris' index reduces to (a) energy consumption, and (b) size of largest city. And in fact, it makes very little difference if one throws out (b) since that has also grown a lot more in the last 200 years than has energy consumption.<br /><br />This exposes the follwing flaws:<br /><br />1. Morris gives the impression of being more sophisticated than he is. He should just call his index \\"energy consumption per capita\\".<br /><br />2. If Morris had chosen some other time, say 1800 CE, to define as the time where the then-global-maximum value of each metric was normalized to 250, he would have got a quite different picture. Metrics (b) (c) and (d) would have been much more important, and so might be the \\"shape of history\\" he uses to answer his big questions. Clearly the index should not depend on what is taken as the baseline year. (This problem would not have arisen if Morris had taken the logarithm of each metric before adding them together. Of course that could lead to other problems, as he gives makes metrics = zero for primitive societies).<br /><br />3. I don't believe his claims that he knows energy consumption to with a 10% error margin. Much of his justification for his figures seem to be circular, as they are based on historian's impression of the sophistication of the society which his figure is supposed to measure.<br /><br />4. What geographical region is to be considered for calculating the energy consumption per capita? The richest state? The richest ethnic group? The richest  million people? The whole \\"core area\\" of East and West (and who defines this?) Morris is quite unclear about this.<br /><br />Given the above, Morris' claim that he \\"explored several other traits (for example, area of largest political unit, [and others I've omitted]) but all had severe evidence problems or failed the test of mutual independence.\\"  is pretty dubious.<br /><br />Let's consider \\"area of largest political unit\\".<br />a) I'm pretty sure this is better defined and, at least since 1000BCE, is better evidenced that energy consumption per capita in that part of East or West I [Morris] consider appropriate to consider\\",<br />b) It is certainly independent of energy consumption. (The Mongol Empire was far larger than any before or since (until the 19th century) but I'm sure did not have a remarkable level of energy consumption.<br /><br />I'm not saying that \\"area of largest political unit\\" is a good measure, I'm just saying that Morris' justifications for considering and then rejecting it are nonsense.<br /><br />The obvious metrics that I do think are missing relate to<br />a) level of scientific, mathematical, and geographical knowledge.<br />b) maximum distance travelled by merchants/explorers/ennvoys.<br /><br />If these were included I think the West would have overtaken the East far earlier than the late 18th century, as in Morris' shape of history.<br /><br />The real message is that we need to graph more than one metric to grasp the shape of history, and to consider more than just \\"East\\" and \\"West\\".<br /><br />But still, buy the book. It will teach you a lot and really make you think.

B003T9UUQI|5.0|During my early teen years, I devoured Herbert's Dune series, Asimov (Foundation Trilogy), Niven (Ringworld) and others. Dune was a  bit much and I re-read it in my 20's. Loved it dearly. I've been searching for another similar dense, far-reaching, multi-layered SF and with Revelation Space I found it. I won't give much away, but I\\"ve also read some of his shorter RS related stories and I've really been sucked into the bizarre, macabre, and intricate story lines. Yet, it is the longer form in which Alastair Reynolds shines: a large enough canvas that allows him to paint the complex story I dig. On to Redemption Ark now...
0545123283|4.0|I've been waiting to read Linger ever since I finished reading the last line of Shiver. That was a year ago. This whole time I've been wondering what's going to happen and how is it going to happen. And because it's been a year since I've read Shiver, I really wished I had the time to re-read it before starting Linger. I had forgotten about some of the secondary characters and I was unsure about some details so I did the next best thing - I went on Goodreads and read all the reviews that contained spoilers ;)<br /><br />Surprisingly, the characters I was most looking forward to read about were not Sam and Grace but Isabel and Cole. Those two characters took center stage for me. I like Isabel a lot better in this book than I did in Shiver. She has definitely grown on me by showing a bit more compassion. She's ridden with guilt by her brother's death. But I love that she hasn't lost that brusque demeanor of hers. I also liked Cole. He's a new character that was briefly introduced in Shiver. He knows what he wants and knows what he signed up for, though it doesn't entirely go to plan. Sam and Grace became the focal point for me towards the end.<br /><br />There are 4 POVs in this book. It may seem overwhelming or intimidating to follow but it wasn't, for the most part. The only problem I had with the alternating POVs was the frequency in change between them. At times, I found myself turning the page back to see whose POV I was reading, which did leave me a bit confused but was easily rectified.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the book covers in this trilogy. The Linger cover compliments the storyline perfectly and it's a great companion cover to that of Shiver's. The title ties in perfectly with the essence of the story. I like the simplicity of the title being only one word but don't let that fool you; it packs great meaning with what's about to unfold before your very eyes.<br /><br />It was a bit slow in the beginning but in true Maggie fashion, she did not disappoint. I knew the ending would pack a good punch and Linger did just that. Have patience going in; you'll be handsomely rewarded. The ending left me wondering how things are going to pan out. Though, I'm not sure how I feel about Sam's decision...<br /><br />I cannot wait for the last installment in this series, Forever, to come out!ood punch and Linger did just that.

B0036TGSR6|2.0|Ghostwriter gets a few points for its acting and locale, but there are so many clunky plot quirks that the effect is ultimately spoiled. Worst is the notion that a supposedly \\"intelligent thriller\\" hinges on the belief that the CIA will happily kill anyone who gets in their way, and that rendition of terrorists is an obvious and universally recognized war crime. We are also apparently supposed to assume that anyone involved with Halliburton is eeevil (Daily Kos readers will love this flick).     It hardly helps that the source of all this anti-US moralizing is a director who is avoiding trial in the US for sexual assault. I guess rendition is too much like extradition?     Add to all that the lack of any clear reason for the main protagonists to act the way they do, and an incredibly dumb resolution to the \\"mystery\\" (hint: it involves Googling a person's name. Who would ever have thought of doing that?). It all adds up to a very naïve thriller.

0375704027|4.0|To love and to lose, and not giving up. To love - over and over again. Despite all sadness he faces in his life, Toru Watanabe, the main character of Haruki Murakami's Norwegian wood\\", doesn't quit loving and being loved. He rarely succeeds, and by that, the writer has a chance to exanimate the dynamics of love, because, as it was one too many time been sung: it is a many splendored thing.<br /><br />Watanabe, sometimes, seeks in the others what he has lost inside. The search is in vain, and the woman who crosses his path are as desperate as he is. Naoko is the first one - the girlfriend of his best friend. Then he meets Midori, another troubled girl. \\"Norwegian wood\\" most of the time portrays women in a strange way - a combination of devotion and love with fear and aversion.<br /><br />Murakami's first big hit, \\"Norwegian wood\\" doesn't display the characteristics that made him famous: the supernatural, the fantastic and so. Aim for some sort poetic realism the novel brings the pop vibe of the 1960's when being young and a student meant more than ever. His character are young people who encapsulate the spirit of an era.<br /><br />In this novel, his abilities and skills are evident, but still sometimes there is too much of a good thing. His prose, despite poetic and sensual, fells a little overcooked - but, still, it is impossible not to be touched by the faith of unhappy lovers.

B004HB1DAY|5.0|Bildungsroman is a word usually associated with novel about a boy's life entering into the world of adults. But there isn't a better way to describe Betty Smith's beautiful \\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" - except it isn't about a boy, but about a girl, Francie Nolan. It is a sad story - one that we have seen so many times -  and, yet, Smith is capable of making it fresh and touching, because her prose is confident and abundant in details.    Despite not being narrated in the first person, the story has the intimacy of narrator-protagonist, because we learn so much about Francie and the ones who surround her - her parents, he brother, friends and relative. She belongs to the same league of \\"To kill a mockingbird\\"'s Scout; and Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. They are kids whose wisdom is beyond their age. They are perceptive and sensitive about life and, specially, its difficulties and obstacles.     What makes Francie Nolan - and consequently \\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" - an enduring character is that in she we can see all of us. The girl is the fear of growing up, and, at the same time, she is the courage overcome our neighborhood after something bigger. We accompany her for too many years in the narrative, and become close friends with her.     Francie is Betty Smith - Betty Smith is Francie. But she is also each of any of us fighting an everyday battle for a better living. Life has rarely been kind or fair to her, and in that we see every injustice kids have suffered all around the world, what makes of \\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" a perfect book for every generation - anywhere in the world.
B000U7169W|4.0|I personally liked this movie despite the negative reviews it was nice to watch a horror film with an entirely different and sinister story line. I surely would not take it to church and watch it either folks but this is not about religion it is only entertainment nothing is to be taken out of context from movies, games, or music really people should not view these things as tools to influence others because they really do not have that intent with the exception of a documentary or reality type TV people must not take things as serious as they do. I think the problem with this world is that someone says or does something without the intent to cause any harm mentally and then some person takes it to heart a bit too much and this causes triggers a violent reaction. I can not stress enough it is only entertainment if you watch a horror movie it is not the intent to worship the devil it is just the intent to be scared or entertained no different then riding that roller coaster at an amusement park. And this movie is a good entertaining horror flick maybe not what you would expect but I think that's what provided me the good vibe for this movie was the fact that it was totally different then what I had expected and the effects were rather interesting.
0802473156|5.0|My boyfriend and I both have our own copies of this book and have read it and discussed together.  We first heard about it when married friends utilized it's wisdom to rebuild their marriage.  Rather than wait until our relationship is struggling, my boyfriend and I decided it would be smart to be proactive and avoid conflict before it starts. It has already made us stronger as a couple and happier and more secure in our love for each other.  Can't say enough good things about it!
B0015XHP3Q|4.0|The same old [...]kicking taking no names Rambo is back for this installment of RAMBO III. Stallone does a great job in action flicks still to this day still in great ripped shape and ready for action he strikes back. Now the only thing left to get is the part 1 part 2 blu ray which I have seen at walmart being sold both together now they don't have anymore copies it seems but I will be watching for it to drop on amazon to complete my collection.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|Better than your average caper movie, \\"The Town\\" focuses on a group of four career criminals (led by Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner, who is quickly becoming a favorite of mine) from Charlestown in Boston. They're smart and good at what they do--until Ben Affleck's character falls for the bank manager they rob. Wanting to leave his criminal past behind him, he appeals to his cohorts, who refuse to let him get away before pulling off one last job. Commitment to friends becomes compromised with his developing love for the bank manager, and the authorities, in the form of Jon Hamm as an FBI agent and the always underappreciated Titus Welliver as a Boston PD detective, begin closing in. The story is smart and well-developed, and the action sequences are explosive and exciting. Not quite sure this movie is Oscar material, as some have argued, but it certainly affirms that Affleck has matured considerably as an actor and a director.
0140120416|1.0|First some background about my experience with languages. I am presently using Rosetta Stone and Pimsleur to learn Russian, which is the third foreign language I have studied. Rosetta and Pimsleur are fine sources for audible learning. I wanted a supplement to enhance my understanding of text and writing too.<br /><br />After viewing sample pages here on Amazon I was unsure what to think about this book. There were so many positive reviews that I decided to order the course. This was a big mistake. I returned the book just a few days later.<br /><br />Unequivocably I must say this book is terrible! I am astounded there are so many positive reviews because this Penguin course is one of the worst books to learn the Russian language. Although the chapters are structured, the material within them is disjointed and sometimes antiquated.<br /><br />The book is a hybrid between a handbook of words and a tutorial. It is not anywhere near the style of modern language books. It presents a more or less random list of words to the reader. Some of them (such as \\"sputnik\\") are useless in every day modern society. The author wrote this material many years ago and never updated the work significantly. The latest edition is 15 years old. Its roots are much older.<br /><br />Save your money and buy something else. Amazon has many other fine books to learn the Russian language. The low cost of this book should not influence your decision. You will get what you pay for.
B004BCT2HU|5.0|We heard this presentation at a November, 2010 broadcast on PBS.  I was able to buy the DVD a few weeks later and also his earlier one(2009)where he speaks German.  Both are fantastic!    My wife is thrilled with his music.  I enjoy it thoroughly myself.  For the last few weeks we have watched one or the other DVD almost every night.    My wife plays the violin for a local orchestra and she is thrilled with his music.  She particularly enjoys his playing two or more chords at once.    Although I am not a musician, I enjoy it thoroughly myself.  He is amazing and one of his kind.  He also has a pleasant and friendly personality.    I just enjoy it all.  I wish that he had more DVDs available.  Yes, addictive is the word.  Music is said to be a hint of heaven.  This one certainly is.    His last piece, Hey Jude, is out of this world.  Pure enjoyment!  This DVD is highly recommended.

B004FD398S|5.0|This movie looks fantastic in 3D (with our LED Vizio 55\\" 3d set that we obtained via Amazon)!  It looks even better, at times, than it did at the 3D movie theater!  We've been going to 3D movies for a very long time... way before it became in vogue; we would religiously go to 3D movies long ago, seeing them on the big IMAX screen at Navy Pier in Chicago.  We have a good number of 3d movies on dvd... and this one is one of the very best in terms of visual magnificence!<br />  This movie is the best!  It shows how other planets can have a diversity of life that is equally spectacular and beautiful.  It reveals how intelligent beings can be very appreciative of mother nature and of the whole of life... while unintelligent beings can act like mechanical automatons, indifferent, callous and uncaring.  The movie shows us the absurdity of blindly following others.  The Navi reminded me a lot of our indigenous Native Americans.  This is an insightful, compassionate movie for all ages!
B0046MOVD0|5.0|Great actress great movie I never get tired of the next zombie movie hey after all they are the living dead it would be awfully hard to rid all of them it will surely take some time with the small number of surviving people there are I hear rumors that there could be 5 more resident evil movies count me in to buy all 5 blu rays as soon as they hit the shelves. Shame WB won't pull there heads out of there behinds and make the Matrix 4 everyone keeps asking for it just throw down the cash grab the crew and make it! Does this studio want to make money or go bankrupt whatever it takes you want to beat box office records that is your ticket... But anyways back to Resident Evil they kind of left us hanging with Milla getting that shot in the neck did she lose her strength and ability from this shot or did she in fact have no reaction it seemed as if she was weaker directly after that but hard to say in the end.

B000005DQR|5.0|Not long before getting this album a few years ago, a friend of mine suggested it as \\"one of those CD's that you could put on at most any party, and people would bob their heads to it whether they were aware of it or not.\\" It's true. It can be background music or it can be cranked. Infinitely listenable atmospheric turntablism, and one of the first discs that got me into electronic music and its numerous subgenres. However, unlike most of the other electronic albums I own (should we even call this 'electronic'? it's just spliced samples over BA drum beats), this one can be played the whole way through without needing to skip over lame, hokey, or embarassingly bad tracks.
1590171993|5.0|This is, quite simply, a masterpiece of our age. In a hundred years, universities will be studying the quiet intensity of this book and its hero, who understands the depths of our collective soul far better than anyone around him. The book erodes the myth of the hero that has remained with us for thousands of years and brings to us a portrait of such damning reality that I wonder at anyone who can read this book and remain unaffected.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I was really angry that Mr. Larsson had had the nerve to die after writing this series! How dare he! The story goes that he walked into the publisher, left the manuscript of the trilogy, walked out and was dead a few months later. How sad for all of us, (to finally get published, and then die--bummer!) that there will be no more of these elegant, interesting characters and arcane plot twists.  If you like the mystery thriller genre, then these three books are as good as it gets, in a class with P. D. James and others. I was surprised to learn that his female hero was patterned after Pippi Longstocking, a childhood favorite of my now grown children. Mr. Larsson imagines what this odd and powerful child would be like as a grown woman and the result is both disconcerting and very interesting.
B002O5M4SA|4.0|Sporting many European influences in the final product for this film, resulted in an emotionally charged & layered story, strategically interspersed with relevant and appropriate action sequences.  Considering the co-star's tender age, Natalie Portman proves more than worthy of her acting talents, in her very first substantial movie role.  She and versatile actor Gary Oldman really steal the meat of the film, and both bring true elements of believability to each role.  Portman's character oozes vulnerability and life-induced maturity, while Oldman stirs up chilling, more-than-you-wish-to-see fanaticism ala Heath Ledger via The Dark Knight.    The only minor complaint I may have is specific scenes of movement transition on some of the actors, where the blu-ray disc tends to reveal some pixelation.  Other than that, this is a rather charged film, which moves along on its own momentum quite nicely.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|RE:Afterlife...  First off I would have to let everyone know before buying this that in this chapter of the series it does have its ups and downs.  For example this movie starts off really Matrix-like with Alice taking revenge against Umbrella in Tokyo...no zombies,no mutations,just kicking Umbrella ass.  Then the movie drags you to see how Alice loses her powers because of Wesker's sneakiness(no powers?really?).  Afterwards,the film takes you to \\"Arcadia\\",Alaska where Alice searches for her comrades from the last film to find Claire Redfield at her throat but only for a moment which IMO should've been a duel.  Then you get to L.A.,California to find other survivors in a prison,one including Claire's brother Chris Redfield played by Wentworth Miller from Prison Break.Ironic?Yes.  But the main reason to watch this movie is for the final bout between Alice,Claire and Chris against the reborn Super Wesker while \\"The Outsider[Apocalypse Mix]\\" by A Perfect Circle is playing although it is not as great as the game but the music pumps you up to watch it over and over again(me specifically for being a APC fan).  All in all,the movie does drag on alot of the time more than any of the films before it but being a fan of the series game and movie-wise i gave it 4 stars for the effort.  Oh yeah don't take out the movie after the credits start rolling because you sorta get a sneak peek of what's to come from the next movie.Gamers won't be suprised but people who only watch the movies will if they know who \\"SHE\\" is.
0316067938|1.0|Well, its taken me a year and a half to finally write a review. At first I couldn't even talk about it. This book left me so utterly devastated, I literally had to go through the 5 stages of grief to get over it.     Grief Stage 1 : Denial  This book can't be the real copy. It just can't.. there's no way. It's not even written like Stephanie Meyer's other writings. *Flips to front to check authenticity* No.. no.. NOOOO!!!    Grief Stage 2 : Anger  How could she do this.. HOW!!! Why would she destroy her characters like this, making them mindless zombies to her perfect world plot, that only gets her own fantasy jollies off. YOU SELFISH B*#@&!!    Grief Stage 3 : Bargaining  You can re-write it Stephanie! There's still time. You have to.. That's it, your just gonna HAVE to re-write this because, this is obviously garbage. And the world will hate it and you'll just have to have Bella \\"wake up\\" from the breaking dawn nightmare and go on with the REAL story. You just .. have to....    Grief Stage 4 : Depression  *endless sobbing on husbands shoulder* EDDWWAAAARRRDDDD!!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!! WHERE AAARREEE YOOOOUUU!!!!    Grief Stage 5 : Acceptance  Still waiting...    I've since read the book 3 times, hoping time will allow me to come around to it. And I've now decided that this book is my twilight nicotine patch. The first three have me so astronomically addicted and the fourth just annihilates everything. Its my own renesmee, killing my hopes, dreams, and fantasies from the inside. *vomits fountains of blood*    Would anyone like to create a group therapy circle for the Twilight mourners?
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|1.  I had high hopes for this HBO series like many folks based on the Band of Brothers etc...  But unfortunately, this mini-series was a complete dud.  It makes me wonder... a lot of things, but the chief among them is the buring question:  who in the world wrote this tangential mini-series.  As with many things in life, it all comes down to the fundamentals and in films that means solid writing and solid acting.  The acting was ok, but with the completely terrible writing, it just made the mini-series barely watchable.<br />2.  It's something that could have been great, but unfortunately was marred back the lack of a coherent story and solid writing.
B000BFH2S2|4.0|Buble does a fine job of singing on this album and dvd.  I really enjoyed the big band that was making it swing!
B001OQCV2E|2.0|Even if you view this as a \\"popcorn\\" type movie, 2012 is terrible.  By the third time I saw John Cusack narrowly escape doom by inches while the ground beneath him is literally crumbling, I was thinking \\"here we go again.\\"  All the CG was so over the top it eventually becomes a parody of itself, and it got *so* repetitive that it became a bit boring.  Most filmmakers know that 100 explosions are not necessarily 10 times better than 10 explosions, a lesson lost of 2012.<br /><br />Then of course add in the stereotyped characters, nonsensical plot, and a pretty good cast wasted.  The plot holes are stupendous.  At the end I felt like I had lost two hours of my life.  But I did finish the movie, and I think that Cusack and Oliver Pratt did the best they could with the material provided, so for that I give the movie two stars.
B003HARV7A|3.0|I will not attempt to justify the non-worthiness of this movie, for any cinematic observer probably has heard enough negative commentary or poor reviews.  Instead, I must profess that my desire to own this film is not based on plot integrity, production value or Oscar-worthy acting.  Far from, actually.    It's simple - just eye candy.  There.  I admitted it.  Just blatant, regressive male hormones that took over my most primeval urges of the most Freudian nature.  I never had a real, tangible interest in the film's primary star - Elizabeth Berkley, until I saw this movie.  \\"Saved By The Bell\\" never did it for me, and was too teeny-bopper for me by that time, anyways.  But Lord and behold - I see Miss Berkley on this big screen movie, and I was instantly mesmerized by her vivaciousness.  I was hooked along with line & sinker.    Yes, it's all physical and superficial, and I must be going through a mid-life crisis.  Other than that, I truly enjoyed this film for what I understood it to be, and for what it's worth to the pleasure centers of my cerebral cortex.      Does it help that I truly enjoyed Paul Verhoeven's other masterpiece: \\"Total Recall??\\" ;)
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I have this watch in black, I liked it so much I just ordered it in the tan. An automatic takes some of my energy I produce by moving and uses that to time my life.  Mine keeps +5-7 secs a day. I do not need a quartz watch anymore as I have a cellphone. The engine in this watch is wild it blows my mind It is such a good design. The dial is so easy to see and get the info you need quickly.  Then the Seiko 5 emblem on it looks like a superman badge on the front of it. The lume on this watch is really nice and if I put a flashlight to it for a few mins it will hold a workable lume all night.  FYI you can get these for under $70us
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I remember back in college taking a literature class that focused solely on the history and origin of vampire-based literature going back to the Roman era. The original premise of the vampire was nothing like you see in the Twilight movies or Western Culture/Hollywood's version of the vampire as being Wesley Snipe's Blade or the cool kids that drive brand new Volvo's to school or soap opera models. Vampires were flawed outcasts of their society. And much of the drama was based on these creatures penetrating the normal world and trying to live parallel to humans whiles satisfying their own desires. In fact, the flaw and weakness of the vampire was their inability to live normal mundane lives whiles desiring to live such a life. In the first vampire literature it was the vampires who were the victims of a stern conservative religious society that ostracized and exterminated anything that didn't confirm to their beliefs or modes. There is also a strong homoerotic and sexuality of the vampire but also love and caring between vampires or between a vampire and a human they desired.<br />Hollywood missed the point completely but Let The Right One In touches on all the original facets of the vampire literature.<br />It is unpolished, cold, gritty, sensual, restraint and beautiful. And it does this with kids! It is an adult horror movie staring kids!<br />They are no big stars or supermodels or teen sensations in this movie so there is a high degree of honesty and storytelling in the film. Nothing is dumbed-down or over explained like Hollywood tends to do. These actors are not going to be plastered on book bags or have action figures made of them or be in coca cola or Volvo adverts. This is honest and pure story telling without the clutter of special effects or product placement.<br /><br />Watch and Enjoy!
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I bought this because I remember how much I loved the Bourne Series.  I watched the first of the series and was surprised at how much I remembered and how much seemed new to me.  I intend to watch the other two within the next few weeks (when I have time).  I would recomend this series to anyone who enjoyed any or all of the Bourne movies.
0312427999|5.0|I personally enjoyed this book because I feel that Naomi Klein did an excellent job in explaining why capitalism is not a good economic system and how milton friedman had deregulated the banking system and encouraged the privatizing of businesses. I also liked the way she showed how milton friedman influenced alot of different countries that were under dictatorship to use capitalism. I believe that this book really shows how and why capitalism is not a good economic system. Michael Moore also had a movie that came out called Capitalism a Love story it is really good and I highly suggest that anybody of any political party whether it be Republican, Democrat, Liberal, Conservative, Libertarian, Parliamentarian, Green party or Panafricanist should watch the film Capitalism a Love story and read the book The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein.
B0045HCJFS|3.0|Excellent Movie for classic 80's & 90's Action...or just a Curt Russell fan.  However *warning* if you want a widescreen version - I ordered widescreen, all of packaging says widescreen and the disk says widescreen, however, the movie was full screen - quite disappointing.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|When I first viewed this movie on premium cable, it stirred my sense of emotions immediately.  From the get-go, you're immediately drawn into the gist of the film, and ride this roller-coaster of fear, anxiety and realistic, but necessary violence, right along with Liam Neeson - and the audience will not let go, until the film's final conclusion.    The story is well conceived & believable, and you can see yourself just a notch removed from being immersed in the role that Liam Neeson plays - except your feeling of helplessness will easily exceed that of Neeson's character, who is more than capable to right the wrongs that have been sprinkled before him.    In essence, you feel his pain, his sense of potential loss, and the calm he must exude to persevere through the emotional entanglement that now has been thrusted into his lap.  You will bite every nail, suspiciously shift every movement of your eyeball, and cheer every moment Neeson comes closer to justice rarely served in the real world.    As far as the quality of the blu-ray, there are no complaints to mention.
0385341679|5.0|The people that have voiced how unsatified they have been with the \\"ending\\" . . . . last year I sent Moning an email and she actually answered it (or perhaps an assistant did). She stated that this was \\"not necessarily\\" the end of the series, (I had voiced I was sad to see the series end). Even at the end of the book it states \\"the end . . . for now\\".  I thought the book was very well done, and was happy with the ending of this particular book. I like a little mystery left. My only disappointment was:  SPOILER . . .      I was disappointed that V'lane wasn't actually V'lane. I had liked that character and felt a loss that it wasn't really him throughout the series. I had found him funny and amusing and he ended up being evil. Too bad.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|this movie was great! however, i will be soon getting a blu ray player to enjoy this movie for all its worth! great acting, great graphics, and sound. a true masterpiece, no wonder it topped titanic in the box office. buy this one today! you will enjoy it!
0066620996|5.0|As many others have noted, this is an excellent book for anyone in the business world that desires to work in a successful business.

1594202842|3.0|Great Satire! Great Fun!    Amy Chua's dark humor and cutting wit of \\"Tiger Mothers\\" compares well with Jonathan Swift's modest proposal of selling Irish famine babies for food.  Of course Professor Chua is writing satire.     A careful reading reveals she is making a coy reference to Mao's Great Chinese Cultural Revolution.  Remember that dark page of history forty years ago?  A time when millions of disturbed and angry young Chinese weaned on abusive, blind and mindless obedience, rampaged throughout China, torturing, murdering and destroying everything in their path?     For sure, more died in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution than ever perished in the Irish potato famine.    Let's give Ms. Chua kudos for her masterful  `tiger mother' satire.  As a Yale professor she is smart enough to know that had she been an educator in China in 1966, she would have be denounced, spat upon and paraded through the streets of Beijing with a dunce hat on her head.     Ms. Chua is warning us that all this could happen again.  She is telling us that just as tigers can't change their stripes neither can tiger mothers.    Jan Sutter
1594202842|1.0|Anyone who has read or knows anything about emotional intelligence will note that Ms. Chua is a floundering D student in the arena of emotional intelligence. When she says that raising a child with her method is &#34;harder&#34;, she is telling an outright lie to the reader and probably to herself. How many people have not felt the urge to smack a young child, because they are making us so angry that the action would make US feel better? Ms. Chua is merely giving in to the instinctive urge to meet frustration with nastiness. It is far harder to become enraged at a child and hold yourself together than to drag a 3-year old out to the porch and leave her there just long enough to stave off Child Services. Ms. Chua's parenting style shows me one thing about her: She lacks emotional control. Don't tell me that her outbursts at her children were not, in most part, meant to make HER feel better. It's like a hundred little revenges everyday. &#34;How dare you anger me by getting a B! I'll show you!&#34;.<br /><br />What I find most absurd is that Ms. Chua's method creates the children upon whom, very quickly, the method will no longer work. If you are striving to create an intelligent child, how long will it be until the kid figures out that your praise is nothing more than pandering designed to lure them into another A? How longer until they figure out that mommy's happiness is little more than a dog treat, designed to fool them into studying 30 hours a week?
030746363X|5.0|I got this book a few days after getting a gym membership and I have found it to be immensely helpful in finding a rhythm for nutrition and fitness.  The difference between this book and say Jon Basedow's Fitness Made Simple is simply stunning: Jon talks toward you and Tim talks to you.  Each of the \\"Finer Points\\" chapters answer questions you are certainly going to have once you finish the preceding chapter on weight loss, muscle gain, etc.  His ongoing dedication to his readers through the blog as well as his Q&A sessions at Twitter, Google and Facebook demonstrate a drive for data and feedback that is missing from FMS.  And the science is just fascinating!  The \\"Ice Age\\" chapter had me gasping out loud and the \\"Geek's Advantage\\" bonus information is intriguing, if a bit dense at times.<br /><br />One thing about the people who dislike the book or seem to find a lot of inconsistencies: Most don't seem to have experimented at all or for very long with the principles found in 4HB.  If you haven't proven it with your own trial-and-error process, it is pretty bogus to proclaim the book a failure or a fraud.  As to inconsistencies, yes, they are there.  I applaud the fact that within a month he already has a blog post with a number of typos and corrections to be made in the book itself.  But keep in mind, Tim's written a book that is trying to be all things to all people.  Want fat loss?  It's in there.  Want to gain muscle?  It's in there, too.  And, not surprisingly, you are going to confuse yourself to death if you try to do BOTH at the same time.  So, avoid the dairy 6 days a week if you want to lose fat, but drink a liter or gallon of milk a day if you want to put on those freakishly large muscles.<br /><br />And that's ultimately what really appeals to me about 4HB.  Tim treats you like an adult with a functioning brain and assumes that you aren't just looking for a drill sergeant to obey without thinking.  He gives you some very compelling science, explains his personal philosophy and vast experience in body recomposition (among other things) and then lets you take what you want and leave the rest.  I've followed the Slow-Carb diet and his personal three-workout split of Pushing, Pulling and Leg days at the gym for about three weeks.  Last week, I started drinking half a liter of cold water in the morning, ice pack against the neck/trapezius at night and four cold showers a week.  I have already dropped 11 pounds while seeing my muscles get bigger and bigger.  I can't wait to see what the next few weeks brings.

1594202842|1.0|Fortunately I didn't have to buy this book; a young thirty-five year old client loaned it to me so that I might understand the tiger mother she has. As a psychotherapist who treats many highly successful adults, I can testify to the fact that money, fame, awards and competition do not insure contentment, joy, peace or happy endings. What the author fails to understand is that all of us, including children, have an inner life and an outer life. Sadly focusing on perfectionism and winning does nothing to enhance our well being or connection. This author is using her children to meet her own needs. Perhaps if she took an inward journey she could find the demon that drives her.     I am also the author of Wonderful Ways to Love A Child and Every Day Love: The Delicate Art of Caring for Each Other and while I do advocate boundaries and guidelines for child raising, I also advocate inspiration and encouragement as a means to developing talents and reaching potential. The author's method is brutality and bullying. What a harsh world the author lived in and is now re-creating for her children.

0316017922|5.0|This is an eye opening book.  The author does an excellent job laying the groundwork then leading you through the lives of very successful people.  The facts that he gathered and then articulated in the book felt new, encouraging and refreshing.  As a parent of 2 young ones, the book really motivated me to instill a hard work ethic and to keep up the focus on the kids school work.
0307278255|4.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed the novel vision put forth in the [[ASIN:B003K16PBE Interpreter of Maladies]]I looked forward to an expanded vision in this book.  Sadly I did not find it: mor eof the same.  However, that same is so good that I thoroughly enjoyed the book, particularly the first chapter.  A good friend has just become a widower, and while not enjoying gardening, loves little children so much he is willing to forego many things for them. The first chapter captures daughter and father and grandson so well, with such tenderness adnd universal appeal and understanding, that I completely enjoyed the personal insights it provided of my friend's family.  Lahiri is thoroughly at home in this world that she owns and expresses with translucent clarity.  She can go on forever with these themes as she grows older and digests them for us.  She will always provide a splendid table if she continues so; however, a new tillage of  unaccustomed earth mey produce some weeds, but might just produce another masterwork.  Of course, she might need to till this earth in her real as well as her fictional life, and would that really be worth it?
B00005MM67|3.0|This film was a Christmas gift for my brother. I appreciate that amazon had a film that was made so long ago. It arrived in a timely fashion and he enjoyed it. Even though they have a large screen HD TV and this was made before HD, it was clear and enjoyable.
0060936223|5.0|This is an important book for artists of our day who feel  very  little support for our endeavors. Through this memoir,  Patti Smith  shares intimately  how she has always kept art at the focus of her life during the Summer(s) of Love in NYC.  This a wonderful love story; the love interest  is  clearly the joy of finding one's artistic \\"voice\\" and identity in the 60's and 70's.  Patti Smith reveals a  a shared passion between her and Mapplethorpe  for the creative process  and  their tenderness and support for each other through this process.  It is  a tribute to  the struggles of remaining an artist through the toughest  of times.   For an artist like myself  this read from Ms Smith  is one of those strong reminders that as artists we are tougher than we think we are,  that we  have the guts to ride  the  bumps in the road and keep  on being who we are as creative people.  This is a  story in vivid colors from a poet who sees the world in a unique way, with a cast of very real characters that reside around her and Mapplethorpe at the Hotel Chelsea in the days when bohemians could scrape by in the city.   I have always had a deep respect for Patti as a pioneer woman, first lady of punk, and a hero for girls and women to be who they really want to be. She lives  a famed life without much pretense.  Big Fan of this book. Read it.

B003ZHQVJ4|5.0|I am one of those who believes that rock & roll has long since passed it's zenith. At least 20 years have gone by. But every once in a while an album springs from the crypt to give me hope that the true genre will return. This is one of those moments. Yeah, I know it's Kid Rock and in many circles it's not cool to admit liking his music. That said, \\"Rock & Roll Jesus\\" continues to sell well. If there is any interest in a vintage sound, those who yearn for it should pick this up. I purchased it on vinyl but there was no bonus cuts associated with buying that way. There's not a bad cut on here. (I'm not one to review albums cut by cut.) I will say that even the overly ubiquitous Sheryl Crow back-up vocals are welcome here; on Collide. That same cut has Bob Seger on the ivories but to me knowing that adds nothing. But if Seger's style of rocking is pleasing to you this album will not disappoint.

0393061310|5.0|Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize winning work dares to tackle one of the oldest, most difficult, and at times uncomfortable questions about development of human civilization. Why was it that the civilizations of the continent of Eurasia* achieve the most technological advancement, written language, productive farming techniques, and military power? Why were the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, and Australia technologically 'backward' by comparison?<br /><br />For centuries the answers to these questions was racial and cultural supremacy, such as that the west was simply better than the other 'lesser' peoples. We now quickly and correctly identify such thoughts as hateful, racist, and counter-productive, but questions still remain and often we do not know how to begin to ask them. In recent times the trend for historical revisionists is to try to focus on the strengths of the conquered cultures and explaining that their down fall was due to disease or dishonorable trickery. Nevertheless, more questions remain, if disease was such a factor why was it only one way, and why were the Europeans able to fool their opponents at times easily? Diamond dares to try to tackle these questions head on.<br /><br />\\"The time is now ripe for a fresh look at these questions, because of new information from scientific disciplines seemingly remote from human history. Those disciplines include, above all, genetics, molecular biology, and biogeography as applied to crops and their wild ancestors; the same disciplines plus behavioral ecology, as applied to domestic animals and their wild ancestors; molecular biology of human germs and related germs of animals; epidemiology of human diseases; human genetics; linguistics; archaeological studies on all continents and major islands; and studies of the histories of technology, writing and political organization.\\"p.26<br /><br />Diamond rejects all of the racist and revisionist arguments pointing out that no race or group of people is stronger, smarter, more capable, creative, or more cruel and ruthless. All humans are the same--that is not to say that all individuals are the same and equally as capable, but any large group of humans is just as good as any other. There is no 'master race,' no group of human beings proven superior to every other group of human beings. Diamond successful argues that since people adapt to their environment, often environmental factors determine how a civilization will develop. A good example would be a person from Florida who would find Maine winters intolerable and while someone from Maine would like wise find Floridian summers unbearable. Humans are creatures of their environment and the societies they build are products of the environment as well.<br /><br />Various environmental factors such as how fertile the land is, what types of crops grow, the abundance of large animals that can domesticated, and geographic features. Australia, with rare exception, has terrible land for farming which is why its native population was still in the Stone Age in the 1800s, the Americas have no great animals capable of domestication that put them in at a great military and physical disadvantage. Without great beasts to domesticate they would miss out on a good source of food and would have no Calvary. Animals were also the source of diseases that the Europeans were able to build immunities that peoples native to the Americas were not.<br /><br />Diamond's narrative is a bit difficult and technical even for an advanced reader. Although when he discusses his personnel adventures his narrative becomes more clear, the center chapters that focus and agriculture and farm animals are very tough to plow through. I highly recommend this book, but it is something to be tackled more at the graduate level.<br /><br />*One thing that I strongly agree with Diamond on, is that Europe and Asia are not two continents but one big continent.ive, or more cruel and ruthless.

B0034G4P7Q|2.0|Imagine that you do something large, wonderful (mostly) and you become famous.      A well regarded film producer makes a movie allegedly about your actions, uses your name and real names of others, but it's fiction.  \\"Composite characters\\".  And it contains just enough true information to LOOK like it's not fiction.    Hint: Zuckerberg got involved with his current girlfriend during sophomore year of college.  Whatever reasons he may have had for creating Facebook, romantic relationships do not appear to be a strong underling factor.    Ignoring the dishonesty, I found the movie to be just ok. The main reason I watched it (on an airplane BTW) was because the film itself had become a major issue, something of a cultural milestone, and seems to be winning awards.    So, IMHO, it's just not that great of a movie, and it is misleading as well.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Very well done. Liked it so much better than I thought I would. Superior to all other Robin Hood productions I have seen. Destined to become a classic.
B003W5C0VW|4.0|Ladies and Gentlemen, the Rolling Stones, released briefly  to theaters back in 1974, has finally been released to DVD and Blu-ray.  The movie was filmed in 1972 when the Rolling Stones were touring to support Exile on Main Street. Many people, including myself, consider Exile to be the Stones' greatest album and the early 1970s line-up, with Mick Taylor, to be their best.  The song selection for the film was very good, most having become concert staples all these years later. The Stones' performances on each and every song is great and their fans will be glad to have these peformances for posterity.   The movie itself is not perfect. The lighting is too dark most of the time and the directing could have been better. But dispite the flaws in the filmmaking, the music warrants a purchase and all Rolling Stones fans will want this disc in their collection.
B002ZG980U|1.0|Maybe the movie is great, who knows.  I've been sitting here for 9 minutes now waiting to watch the movie.  Fast forward is disabled, menu is disabled.  I'm returning this DVD.  This is unacceptable!  Warner Brothers should be ashamed.
B00005JLK1|4.0|The first time I saw this I wasn't too impressed. But now that it's been around for a while I realize that it is actually not that bad.  Plot: A group of maritime bounty-hunters (salvagers) are \\"approached\\" by a person claiming to have seen an apparently abandoned ship in the Bering Strait. They agree to all go out there and find it. This turns out to be a near mythical ship that disappeared in 1962 called \\"Antonio Graza\\". Strange things soon start to happen. I can't tell you more without spoiling the plot. But remember, when the mysterious person claiming to have seen this ship is asked if he has told anyone else about it, he replies: \\"Not a living soul...\\"  Remember that line when watching this movie....
B0042U94UQ|1.0|We ordered \\"Despicable Me\\" DVD from Newbury Comics via amazon. Despite the description that this DVD was new it was scratched and stopped playing about 40 minutes into the movie. This was for our child's birthday party and we had to scramble to get a different DVD in the middle of the showing. We ordered one more DVD \\"How to train your dragon\\" which had the same problem and stopped playing in the middle. Really disappointing products.
1582701709|3.0|Good way to keep your thoughts positive, and to stay focused on what you want, and the possibility to have what you want. Heard about it from a friend, and though the book wasn't what I thought it would be, it was still worth the read.
B000IU3Y3W|3.0|With all these NY reissues and archive releases coming out I've been debating with myself whether I should buy CD or Blu-Ray. The first two NY albums sound great on CD. With Fillmore East I decided to get the CD/DVD combination to compare. Perhaps it wasn't the best place to start: live sound and recordings in 1971 were a bit hit and miss. This one sounds fine on CD (clear, but with all the idiosyncrasies of the era's live recordings), but the recording quality doesn't justify splashing out on the DVD version.  Musically it is good, and an interesting artefact, but 'Down By the River' and 'Cowgirl in the Sand' don't have the same light and shade as the versions on 'Everybody knows this is Nowhere', and sometimes those two can feel a bit relentless as a result. I'm sure that anyone who likes Neil Young would want to own it on CD at least, but I'm not convinced this album is one to pay the extra for the DVD upgrade.
1400052173|5.0|Skloot dedicated a substantial amount of time researching and writing this book. Remarkably, through the act of researching this story she actually became a part of it.     The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a science book, but also a moving story of the Lacks family. I am a practicing scientist, so I enjoyed the technical parts of this book - but I was moved by the story and the people involved. It seems to me that this book might have an enduring positive impact on a family that - until now - has experienced only heavy costs from Henrietta's immortality.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|History was never so good as presented in this rich series.  The accuracy (as we know it) is excellent and the elegant costumes and settings make a colorful tapestry for the intense acting.  You almost forget they didn't really have deodorant or toothpaste. The creators have really caught the feeling of the period in all its beauty, cruelty, and sexuality.
B004HYDL1K|1.0|I had been waiting for weeks to see this.  But, there was some sort of political message about illegal immagration.  I'm not entirely sure what it was.  \\"We didn't cross the border, the border crossed us\\"??????  I think one of the appeals of director Robert Rodriguez work is the gratuitous violence.  While the violence was there for sure, the confusing political message didn't seem to belong.
B003ZTQN1I|2.0|I went to see the movie and enjoyed the original singers and the songs from the movie.  The soundtrack has different people singing.  I know I can download the MP3 versions but I wanted the CD with the actors singing not established country stars singing the songs.  Garrett Hedlund & Leighton Meester were great and I wish the album had them singing.
B002ZG999U|5.0|The Expendables starring Sylvester Stallone, is a high octane action film that has the story line of a team of mercenaries including Jason Statham, Jet Li and many other action film actors working as a crew to overthrow a dictator. The villians in this film are played by Eric Roberts and Steve Austin. Cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger are of interest. All of the actors in this film do good work in their roles.    For a purely explosive action film without a realistic plot or realistic story line, the Expendables has the top level action scenes, the explosions and the firepower that makes it a very good action film.    This film is action packed and marked with comedy, slapstick humor and bantering back and forth among the characters and high technology stunts.    The delivery of the lines are very good and funny. The timing and syntax of the dialog are very good and depict the ex-military/mercenaries language, squad mentality and interaction.     The high level of explosive action, the characters, the delivery and timing of the lines, the stunts and the photography make the Expendables worth seeing.    Stallone did a great job at directing and putting this film together considering the many actors involved. The DVD also comes with bonus material, how the Expendables was made, behind the scene activity, commentary and deleted scenes.    The only thing I wish Sylvester Stallone would have done differently was to feature Jet Li and Jason Statham in a little more of the martial arts action.     This would have been difficult due to the quantity of actors used in this film, but would have added to the overall quality of the action.    Jon Green
B0000041Q3|5.0|After hearing several other versions of this rich opera, there is none that can compare to this one.  Set in ancient China, this is the opera the popular aria (sung by Pavarotti) \\"Nessun Dorma\\" (no sleep, rest)comes from. The music is a continuous flow of lush and moving melodies right down to the last note.<br />The heart warming baritone trio performed by the characters Ping, Pang and Pong is one of the lovliest ever composed.  This recording of Puccini's last opera is a treasure chest packed full of beautiful music and a chorus that will leave the listener in awe.  It just doesn't get better than this.
B00498YZH8|5.0|With so many movies to choose from I tend to flip quickly until something catches my eye after which I'll read the Amazon summary and if it appears in any way decent I then move to more authoritative voices; i.e. The NYT's, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, etc. - all before renting.     I wish it were an easier task to find a decent movie as tonight, ignoring my instincts to pass over \\"Winter's Bone\\" as I've done now for weeks based solely on the dvd's cover photo I would have missed what I rate as a not only a five star movie but based on my experience I can say with all honesty;     a) I never lost interest while watching;  b) I cannot compare this movie to any others I've seen; and,  c) Neither the dvd cover NOR the Amazon \\"plot summary\\" proved to in any way to effectively reflect the fine film I'm sure many, MANY Amazon viewers have passed over for these, the very same reasons did I initially :(    Rent this movie!     PS: To Amazon  - I know you have zero influence re: the DVD's cover shot - and I'm sure with thousands of movies in your database you're bound to once in a while \\"compound\\" the movie's plot so as to, how might I say \\"overlook\\" a true gem staring you in the face.  The net/net is that I have no beefs with you - Amazon - and am simply taking advantage of the means in which you have provided your Amazon users to communicate with one another.    Thank You! With so many movies to choose from I will  - moving forward and now having voiced so vocally my own opinions - give much more consideration to reviews submitted by customers whom I'm betting just as I, eventually came across a film they could not but help themselves from commenting on!
B0044XV3R8|1.0|After returning the first 3-disc set of the movie Avatar because the first disc skipped, I was shipped another set. I took this set to my grandchildren, for whom I had gotten it as a Christmas gift. We watched the first disc - no problems. About halfway through the second disc, the movie started \\"breaking up\\". When we took out the disc and examined it, it had marks on it (like they were right under the outer surface of the disc). We looked at the third disc and found the same marks. I am very disappointed in this purchase. I have never had any complaints with anything I have purchased using Amazon, but this was a bust. (The other DVD I had ordered at the same time had no problems.) I am returning this to Amazon as soon as possible.

Great stories and characters but I want to see the kid spread his wings and go for broke. I want to see the excellent flying sequences of the last movie version. I want that 'Up, Up and Away' (ex Radio and 1940's serial versions). I know I'm being quite super ficial but Superman is the guy who flies...that's his job. Batman runs, Green Hornet runs, The Flash runs but sup baby flies, its in the rules. Here in Oz season 10 is still en route (obviously not airmail) so I want to buy this item but I also want the 'Look up in the sky. Its a bird, its a plane..no its...well you know the rest.

B000001G8A|5.0|This Fanciulla is superb.  From the first act that opens with the beautiful basso voice of Gwynne Howell to the thrilling duets by Placido Domingo and Carol Neblett, every performer graces the listener with pure luxury.  Conductor Zubin Mehta is at his best with this unique opera set in California during the Gold Rush.  The mood is certainly that of the old west, but the fabulous music serves it with rich respect and lush melodies. This La Fanciulla del West (the girl of the west) is a genuine treat.
B0047VSW30|1.0|I do not recommend you waste your time watching this.  It is horribly slow, and not very interesting.  The characters are only partially developed, at a very superficial level.  I think they are trying to create a film like the 10 Commandments, but fall so short that the entire film is a waste.<br /><br />I watched it because it seemed like it got such high ratings.  I find it hard to believe anyone enjoyed this film.
B0041T4OHQ|5.0|As a storyteller, I'm always on the lookout for new books or stories to add to my repertoire of established favorites. When you find a picture book that really clicks, it's such a wonderful feeling. How Chipmunk Got His Stripes by Joseph Bruchac, and Beverly Billingsly Borrows a Book by Alexander Stadler are two of my standbys. Even better is when I run across that rarest of finds: a book that leaves me feeling like I could sing. (I am deliriously unmusical.) Let's Play in the Forest While the Wolf is Not Around by Claudia Rueda has been one of my favorites for several years.<br /><br />With Pete the Cat, Litwin and Dean have achieved children's librarian nirvana. This is, literally, a perfect book, for reading and singing aloud. Large, bright colored illustrations which are easy to see from across the room, a catchy tune that kids will quickly pick up and sing along with, an introduction to colors paired with a cheerful, optimistic message and a sense of humor. This book has it all. I'm buying multiple copies and hoarding them against the day that this wonderful gem ever goes out of print.

I bought this cover at a local box store and it didn't even last through the first winter before cracking and tearing to pieces. Go with the Premium - its supposed to be much more durable. That's what I'm buying after I finish this review! Good luck!

0061122416|5.0|This book is a story of a young man following his dream. When I picked this book up, I just could not put it down. I finished reading it it one day.   I took on reading again just recently when I decided it was time for me to confront things in my life an see what kind of changes I had to make to be happy. This story made me realize that I need to follow my dreams to achieve happiness, no matter what obstacles come in my way.   I highly reccommend this book to anyone out there who is having trouble realizing the great potential you have inside of you.
0385341679|5.0|The fever series is now my all-time favorite romance epic. Ever since Darkfever drew me in, it's been a breathtaking, heartwrenching, awe-inspiring, and amazingly complex journey. And Shadowfever took me to heights I never imagined. Kudos to Karen Marie Moning for giving us all the gift of the Fever World.
0385504225|4.0|This was a decently written book with a lot of plot twists.  For me, Dan Brown's best book is \\"Digital Fortress\\" because of the fast pace and \\"didn't see them coming\\" plot twists.  With \\"Lost Symbol\\", the most startling plot twist is the one I saw coming right off the bat (though at times he made me second guess myself), but all the other plot twists along the way are surprising and kept me turning the page.  In fact, I was sick in bed with the flu when I read it and the time just zipped by.    I skimmed through a lot of the bad reviews here, and would like to address some of the points that were raised, many of which were legitimate, but others were not.  For instance, one reviewer complained that the antagonist gave up on his motivating quest at the end, which that reviewer did not find believable.  But actually, his true motivation came out at the end (he was driven by his bitterness toward his father rather than a quest for secret knowledge) which was more human and psychologically believable.      Noetic Science was also written about by reviewers as \\"unconvincing\\" and \\"psuedo,\\" and this is the point I would like to address most.  The Institute of Noetic Science was founded by Astronaut Edgar Mitchell (I don't think anyone want to accuse him of not being a true scientist), and if anything, I would complain that what Dan Brown is presenting as new and cutting edge science, as well as ancient and esoteric mystery, has been out in the open and known about for many, many years.  There was much convincing research done at UCLA (by Valerie Hunt, I believe), among other places, before Noetic Science was even an organization.  It has not been widely publicized, but if you are interested, you will find many, many studies proving many of the \\"metaphysical\\" (mind into matter) ideas in the book.  If you remember, Stevie Wonder did an album in the 70's, \\"The Secret Life of Plants\\" based on a book that details numerous studies proving plants have intelligent consciousness and are sentient beings.  Some of the research written about in \\"Secret Life of Plants\\" led to the technology used for Bose sound systems.  Deepak Chopra's book, \\"Quantum Healing,\\" also refers to legitimate scientific research, and a whole field of physics, quantum mechanics, provides further scientific evidence -- all before the term, \\"noetic science,\\" even existed.      As far as the \\"secret knowlege\\" goes, there are numerous churches and centers all around the world that teach these principles, they are called Science of Mind, Religious Science, Centers for Spiritual Living, the Christian-based Unity Churches, and many, many others.  Best selling author Louise Hay's teachings are based on them, as are many other best selling authors.  There is nothing currently secretive or hidden about this knowledge, the power of thought and thinking, and the philosphy that we are all One, with the creative power of the Divinity within each of us, and a respect for the spiritual truth within all religions.  As Oprah Winfrey remarked upon interviewing the producer of the popular movie, \\"The Secret,\\" which purports to reveal this information, Oprah said, \\"I didn't know it was a secret,\\" and indicated she had been living according to these principles for years.     The reason I liked this book so much is also its major flaw -- Dan Brown seems eager to convince those new to this philosophy, and there is a little too much edification and instruction in the novel at times.  But it was just great to read a novel with such a magnificent theme -- that we are all part of God and we are all One, and to have it spelled out that this spiritual philosophy is part of the ideals upon which this great nation of ours was founded. I loved the ending -- that it's all in the Bible if you learn how to interpret it correctly.     I also loved the descriptions of our nation's capital and the fantastic buildings, monuments and institutions within it.  It has inspired in me a desire to go to Washington DCand look at it all again with a new eye.      As far as the Masons go, obviously in previous centuries, where one could be burned as a witch or executed as a heretic, unconventional spiritual beliefs and knowledge had to be kept secret and passed on to others in mysterious ways.  But that's no longer necessary, at least not in the good old USA, where we are free to read, teach and believe any type of spiritual philosophy we choose.  I guess the modern day Masons (should they exist in real life as they do in the novel) figure they may as well keep alive their secret traditions, in case the Christian right or fundamentalist Muslims or any other religious fantatics without tolerance or respect for others gets into power and succeeds in crushing the freedoms that make us the great nation we are.  I personally think it's all out in the open and should stay out in the open and nothing secretive or mysterious needs to be associated with the Truth.       And whatever you believe, this is what's great about this novel -- it gets us to think on these things and share our thoughts with each other.
0743270754|5.0|This book provides an excellent overview of the history and lives of the men who were Lincoln's rivals (for the Presidency) and his Cabinet members.  It skilfully builds a clear picture of each man's character, ambitions and loyalties.    Whilst it may be possible to find more in-depth biographies of some of the players (eg Salmon P. Chase), this book excels in bringing relevant facts together and exploring the dynamics of the relationships between each of the men, with others and with Lincoln.    The expose of each man's weaknesses, which often included an unbridled blind passion for revenge, also provide a stark contrast to Lincoln who truly treated lesser beings 'without malice'.    An fine addition to any Abraham Lincoln library.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|I had recommended this movie to most of my friends. However, one already told me that she absolutely hated it. I'm not surprised, knowing she was a D-student in school. I don't really think you need to be smart to like this movie, but you should be open-minded. I'm sorry, not everything ends like Michael Bay's Transformer movies. The bad guy does win a lot in life. For a movie that was set in a coffin the entire time, the movie's director and writer did an incredibly job of holding the audience's attention. It didn't go the pretentious route, which is admirable.     I am really not trying to be arrogant. This was a good movie. I can't speak for art snobs, but if you're a person who likes finding movies that are diamonds in the rough, watch Buried. If you typically are the sort of person who will only see a movie because of a fancy, expensive trailer, and are not adventurous, skip this. If you need the major entertainment critics and media to tell you to see a movie, skip this. If you like solid, unpretentious, realistic movies, watch this.
B003WTE886|4.0|This is a great CD no question.  I never listened to Taylor Swift before it.  Tonight I listened to some past CD songs on Youtube.  I could not believe how the same they sounded to the songs on Speak Now.  And how the same the songs on Speak Now sound to each other.  What Taylor Swift masterminds is the art of catchy tunes!  She can really carry a rift for all it's worth and then some!  Take a song like Revenge..I mean, awesome, really from beginning to end even though the message is bad.  It's just the way she goes about it, quite cute, quite clever.  Speak Now another example really of bad behavior, breaking up a wedding and taking off with the groom.  But again really adorable.  I really really like this CD and I would have wanted to give this five stars even but Taylor Swift needs to show more versatility on her next CD.  I mean, doll, do something different, I love all you've already done but I want to hear a different sounding song from you.  Maybe even one with a good message?  The one song on this album that was a bit different was Never Grow Up and even then you kind of wish she'd stick something positive in the messge maybe at the end? Nope.  Her songs seem to carry bad messages to a new extreme and make the whole concept of stealing boys and breaking up weddings sound appealing.  More power to her.  Cute as a button and tough as nails. If anything distracts you while listening to this CD don't be surprised if you forget what song you are on.
1594202842|5.0|my personal take on this book is that it's her own journey, and not meant to be a parenting book. it's actually a really funny book... and at times, she reminds me of my mom & my mom-in-law. it seems she has major control issues, but in the end, she realizes this, and learns from it. i don't think she meant to be racist, or anything like that. rather, i find her to be honest, (yes) narrow minded, hard working, strong, and a great mother in many ways. like any mom, she has her flaws, but in the end, her kids can never deny that she walked with them, through every struggle, and every battle.     although this is not meant to be a parenting book, i do think i will use many of her ways when raising my own children. 1) discipline 2) persistence 3) endurance 4) sacrifice (she gave up so much of her own time to sit through every lesson with them)     i admit that many of her ways are extreme, and again, just remember that she's not trying to teach anyone anything. she's talking about her own journey. on sleepovers -- the funny thing is that my mom never let me attend a sleepover, ever. my first sleepover was when i left for college (aside from camping trips of course). my daughter, at 4, just asked to have a sleepover at her best friend's house last week. of course i said no... and i also told her, \\"you can have your first sleepover when you get married\\" (in the most loving tone of course). as a mom, i think sleepovers are overrated & unnecessary too... but i never had the courage to voice this. she had no problem saying this straight out.    so althogether, i admire the author for her courage in writing such a controversial book. she made many enemies... but i think she raised many good points. sometimes the truth hurts, and yes, it brings to question the way that some of us raise our children (letting our children indulge in too much fun during childhood may have repercussions in adulthood, because at a time when they should be learning certain skills and values, they'retoo busy playing around.  again, balance is key here. not all parents know best, but most do.     in this book, it's what you choose to see really... instead of seeing a racist author, i actually saw a person with a great heart, and great dreams, and great goals. she is too controlling for my taste, but i also saw her learning to let go towards the end. it's really a journey... and not a how-to book, so if you can see beyond her little (sometimes ignorant) comments here and there, you will see that there are things you can learn from her, as a mom.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|These cans have been talked about in various places across the web for the past couple of years.  Why?  Because they are cheap, and sound great.  I agree.  FOR THE PRICE: Bass is tight, not overbearing at all, highs are crisp and mids have decent clarity.  Will blow anything for the same price out of the water hands down.  However, if you are a modder, BEWARE:  If you recable these cans (like I have with mogami 2534), the phone overall gets a bit brighter, but the highs can be fatiguing after a while.  I've been listening to them for about 4 months on and off after I've replaced the cables, and I tend to go back to my akg k240s (the phones they modeled these after) because the highs, especially when listening to classical, and music with a lot of cymbals can be taxing on the Superlux.  There is a capacitor mod out there that will bring them back down, which would make it a much more pleasurable experience. For now I use them for gaming and computer use, and they work great.      Comfort:  I have these phones 3 stars for comfort because the pleather ear cushions get hot after a while, and they are quite shallow, so after a few hours, they get sweaty and my ears start hitting the driver cages which hurts the tops of my ears.  This can be fixed with k240 velour pads, or dt770 velour pads (which are much larger and fluffier).      Overall: If you are looking for a budget headphone, for $35, do not hesitate.  I've got HD555s, the k240s mentioned above, hd448s, as well as some others, yet I still bought these, I definitely don't regret spending the money. Great buy.

B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Good read, as the 2nd in his Detective Heat series!  She is brash, funny, gorgeous, and a fantastic detective.  She and Castle make a perfect pair and they truly compliment the rest of the characters.  If you enjoy the tv series, (I really don't follow it) I think you'll love this book.  Can't wait for the next edition!  Always a great ending.  I put Castle in with my favorite authors!
1410430103|1.0|The first Jack Reacher book I read \\"Worth Dying For\\" was interesting. Based on that experience I bought the Kindle edition of \\" Killing Floor\\". What a disappointment! The author's writing style consists of short sentences which are often redundant. He also takes an obscene amount of liberty with facts. Admittedly the book is fiction, but a total regard of facts is hard to ignore. I can sort of live with Jack Reacher being a one-man killing machine, incredibly prescient, irresistibly attractive to women and absolutely indestructible. What I object to is the author's tendency to play fast and loose with  the workings of the military, treasury department, the FBI, the local fire and police departments. Not to mention incredible coincidences such as Jack Reacher's brother whom he has not seen in years turning up at the same weird little town in the middle of nowhere. The brother who is a treasury department hot shot goes missing while on a mission and the Feds couldn't care less. The local fire and police departments are left unattended at night although there is a prisoner in custody! Reacher drives an ancient gas guzzling Cadillac hundreds of miles without refilling the gas tank. On and on I could go. You get the point. I have read my last Lee Child novel.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Things I love about this book (series):<br />1. Mac 5.0 - She's smart, savy, and finally thinking ahead of (almost) everyone and has secrets of her own and she's not sharing (at least not for a huge chunk of this book.)I loved following her journey of self-discovery. It takes a lot to make me more interested in the character storyline, than the romance storyline (which I loved too) and Moning does it here.<br />2. Jericho Barrons - The Alpha male you love and love to hate. He just wants Mac to want him for just him, not some romantic attachments and misconceptions she may have of him... his very  Machiavellian techniques do have a rhyme and reason (how irrestibly male of him - when many males in other Urban Fantasy novels are not alpha enough for their woman.)<br />3. Mysteries solved! - I worried that this series wasn't going to be able to wrap up in one book. I wondered how everything was going to be revealed and understood. Karen Marie Moning ROCKS! She did it and she did it well.<br />4. The writing style - Moning writes like in a style that reads like a classical novel. I really felt transformed and my awareness of my world expanded when I read this book.<br />5. I really felt that the book was like Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series where everyone was after the book - at first, for book after book in this series. I finally figured out that this series is not about finding the book but about the dynamic, transformation of a girl into a woman. When you transcend plot lines into the human condition a book becomes more than just a genre and becomes something more.<br /><br />Criticisms I have of this book (series): (Beware Spoilers)<br />1. The only criticism I have in this book is the ending and it is minor thing when compared to the entire AWESOME series. I'm not talking about the true climatic ending of this book, I'm talking about the post ending. The conclusion of the Barron's family storyline, I thought it was a little too convenient. I felt like it needed a messier conclusion. I'm also talking about the domestic scene at the end. That seemed a little out of character for Barrons. In these two ways, I see how Moning wanted a \\"Romantic\\" ending where everything is neat and tidy and everyone lives happily ever after. I think I prefer the SaintCrow's \\"Dante Valentine\\" series ending. Essentailly, a happy ending with realistic unhappy ending details.<br /><br />I loved this series. I am sad that it is ending. I felt desolate when Mac did. I felt elated when Mac did. Now, I won't get to feel what Mac feels again (unless I reread - which I have done and will do again!). I am excited that we might get to feel what future Dani's or Christian's feels though in possible future series. THANK YOU Karen Marie Moning for writing a new classic series in Urban Fantasy.so talking about the domestic scene at the end. That seemed a little out of character for Barrons.

0307460444|3.0|This cookbook has tons of great suggestions on decorating and pairings.  However, every recipe I tried (~12) gave a very dense cupcake.  I prefer my cupcakes on the lighter side.  I still use it for ideas, but use different batter recipes.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I was drawn to Nikki Heat by the reviews and I was not disappointed! The cast of characters and Castle's style of writing keeps you on the edge of your seat as well as laughing throughout the book.  I couldn't wait to get my hands on the 2nd book in the series after reading this one, and anxiously await the next.
B002MFU9BG|5.0|I was bored on Saturday night browsing Reddit when a link to The Heavy playing on Letterman showed up.  Letterman asked for an encore which is extremely rare or first time, and that caught my eye.  Many Karma points for this one, the album is outstanding.  It's fresh in some ways and yet still feels familiar to some of the old school funk/rock bands.  All killer no filler on this one.
B00493AD74|3.0|Ok, so the \\"character\\" of Elizabeth is shallow, entitled, etc....I read the book, before it became a \\"sensation\\", or before i was aware of it becoming a sensation. I think that is probably b/c there are probably thousands of woman out there who have felt what she is feeling yet don't have the cash or profession to take off for a year.  While the lead up to why Elizabeth is so unhappy in her marriage is barely hinted at in the movie (this i agree with, except it's only a two hour movie, and it would take at least 1/2 hour or 40 minutes to adequately portray that, and we, the audience, want to see Italy, so, chop chop), it is covered quite painfully actually in the book, at which point i almost put it down. I think the reason i didn't put the book down, was because Gilbert can actually be quite a good writer. There are soooo many self-help/travelogue/transformative whatever books out there, which i might be inclined to read, and have tried, and after a few dozen or so over the years, most discarded after a chapter or two, the narrator here is self aware enough to point out her own flaws and write well while doing it, so i didn't put it down. If you read any interviews with E. Gilbert, or the first couple of chapters of her other book Committed, you might come away understanding that she really didn't intend or expect this to become a sensation. I have been known on principle, not to see something or read something, b/c it is  a sensation, makes me distrust it. Whatever, I went to see the movie to get a vicarious trip to Bali and Italy, which i got, so I'm not complaining too much. And the whole complaint that these are first world problems and thus shallow, etc., yes, except if you are THAT unhappy in a marriage, get out before you inflict yourselves on children. Not everyone grew up with a perfect example of how to have a happy marriage, and it isn't always their fault for not having that example. This movie is admittedly the hollywood version of one woman's \\"journey\\".
B0042816YK|5.0|I am not a woman writing this and I did not read the novel.<br /><br />On the other hand I am sucker of films that make me travel.  This film satisfied me largely in this aspect.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, with a soundtrack that is \\"sans faute\\".<br /><br />The film does not portray Liz as an idiotic waif who throws herself head on into the place wherever she goes.<br /><br />She appears to be detached from the situations involved.<br /><br />In the Indian ashram, she readily accepts with a large smile to do PR job, foregoing meditation.<br /><br />The scenes with the chaman in Bali is downright funny.  The chaman's delivery of philoshopy is countered by humorous comments by his assistant which seems to confirm the mild charlatan aspect.<br /><br />The films does not take itself too seriously, despite the underlying heavy \\"searching for a sense in life\\" theme.

He opens it to one particular page when he is sitting on the potty.  He still has a way to go, but the book keeps him entertained no doubt  Only thing is that we have to substitute the Americanised \\"diaper\\" with nappy when we are reading it to him.  Otherwise its a great little book and I would highly recommend.

B003EY7IRC|2.0|This is what I waited for.  I am so disappointed in this book I don't even have words. This series could have ended two books ago.  I was so excited I could not sleep the night before release. And this is what I get?? If I had not pre-ordered this book, I would have returned it within the seven day period. That is how unsatisfied I am.  I am removing it from my kindle and never looking at it again.   What were the Kelters doing in there anyway? They added nothing to the book. And Dani . . . what was the point of her in this book, other to reveal that she was Alina's killer and for there to be no confrontation or resolution. This is how the series started , Mac needed to find her sister's killer. Then she is found and nothing happens. And what was up with I am the concubine, no I'm the king, no I'm the concubine, no I am king. Ahhhh!!!!! Make a decision already. Mac did not grow at all in this book, in fact I think she regressed, and on top of that she became annoying.   I have loved all of KMM books up until now but this one has just left me so disappointed. It's going to take some time for me to recover.
1439107955|5.0|A beautifully written book.  I was astounded at the history, the science, the personal stories of cancer patients, and so many other things woven through the narrative.  As a cancer survivor myself, I came away with a much deeper understanding of diagnosis and treatment of cancers, and enormous respect for, and gratitude to, all those who have struggled for centuries to find the secrets to cure and prevent cancer.
0385341679|1.0|I had re-read the fever series before this book came out, and I wondered how I never picked up on how immature and annoying Mac really was. She acted all tough and stuff but had no ability of her own to back it up. Yes she could feel opps, yes she could see fae,whatever, she did not have the means, smarts or direction to do anything about anything, she always needed Barrons or V'lane to point her in the right direction even though she constantly patted herself on the back.(yes I realize this is fiction, but she is not Jane yellowbrook or Mercy Tompson, she is an annoying female lead)When I did finally get to the fifth book, I was not suprised to be frustrated and annoyed again with Mac. You killed Barrons, your logic makes you grasp at the LM? REALLY? your big plan to suffer him to get your revenge and when he dies is not even a significant event, you whine and plot terribly and stupidly for pages upon pages and then poof he's just dead and all your stupidity is just forgotten. grrrrr. I never saw Mac as a really strong female lead, but I could at least tolerate her until I read the series a second time. I feel all Mac wants is props for how awsome she is, like when she meets Barrons buddies at the club..such a painful scene. I can't stand how she throws tantrums and toots her own horn all the time, I wish Kate Daniles would just kick her ass back to whiney-vill. Oh and one more beef before I end my rant, in the fourth book when she blames everyone for not saving her while she was being turned pri ya, how bout there was a serious war going on..you decided stupidly without ability to go out on your own..you sent Barrons to help the Mcalasters in Scotland so he wasn't in your vacinity,..but instead of looking at your choices you blamed everyone else like the war was just going on to see who would come and save you.. point made your immature and annoying (again not reality, but still a waste of my time)
1599218011|3.0|This book is written in a fun and relatable tone and provides a good message overall- eat more vegetables and avoid processed foods.  The overarching theme is that our current diet is toxic and often \\"acidic,\\" and the author presents a number of studies supporting her conclusions.  Again, good advice overall, as our diet and lives are constantly influenced by a world of fast, inexpensive, and unhealthy food choices.  I only give the book 3 stars because, like many other diet books/authors, she picks and chooses the science that agrees with the premise (meat, dairy, sugar, and maybe even gluten are toxic).  Furthermore, she takes these studies along with anecdotal stories to show a clear cause and effect relation to support her vegan diet while disparaging a traditional diet including meat, dairy, and etc.  I have no doubt that a diet rich in vegetables and excluding processed foods would be a huge improvement for most of us, but it is less clear whether meat, dairy, and gluten should be off limits for every person.  Additionally, while she touches on the differences between raw milk and grass fed/finished meats, she is mostly critical and barely acknowledges them as excellent alternatives to the $1 McDonalds hamburger and milk shake.  Locally grown, humanely raised, and hormone free animal products are not the same as feed lot animals, and while she quotes Paul McCartney saying that \\"if slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone be vegetarian\\" that is simply no true for many of us or our relationship to naturally raised animals.  She presents a lot of gross imagery to deter us from animal products-infected utters leading to puss in our milk and yogurt, but most of these references are more a topic for ethical farming not nutrition.<br />This book does provide useful advice but it's really not new, and while she mocks the low-carb/no-carb Adkins diets, it too offers plenty of research and science supporting that premise.  Today, Gary Taubes has a best seller in Why We Get Fat- his second book demonstrating the science and benefits of a protein heavy/low-carbohydrate diet.<br />Read Crazy Sexy Diet because it's written by a funny articulate survivor with some good advice- eat more vegetables and less junk- but there is nothing wrong with bringing a healthy dose of skepticism and doing some of your own research.et Fat- his second book demonstrating the science and benefits of a protein heavy/low-carbohydrate diet.

B004H8G1WC|4.0|Edgar Allan Poe wrote \\"The Poetic Principle\\" as a series of lectures that were not published until shortly after his death in 1849.  In it, he clarifies various stands he had earlier taken on the genesis of his writing.  He begins by repeating a basic tenet taken from his \\"The Philosophy of Composition:\\"  \\"I hold that a long poem does not exist.\\"  Further, the term \\"a long poem\\" is \\"simply a flat contradiction in terms.\\"<br /><br />  What is critical for the poet is that his poem must \\"elevate\\" the soul, by which he sees a mathematically determined ratio that uses this elevation to fix its value.  Though elevation must surely lead to excitement, it does not follow that this excitement can be sustained indefinitely.  In his earlier essay, Poe had written that no poem ought to be so extended in length that one needs more than thirty minutes to finish.  In \\"The Poetic Principle,\\" he reasserts that the longer the poem, the more rapidly the reader will lose interest.  For epic poems like Paradise Lost, Poe denies its existence as a single unified work.  Rather, he terms such lengthy poems as \\"a series of minor poems,\\" the reading of which inevitably leads to \\"a constant alteration of excitement and depression,\\" which to Poe is a serious defect.  When a reader faces the daunting prospect of maintaining interest while plowing through a long poem, Poe offers the helpful suggestion that this reader might try reading it out of sequence, thus keeping focused on that one part.  Poe mentions the Iliad as an example of an epic poem that is less a single unified work than it is a series of lyrics.  From the Iliad, he contemplates the fate of the epic of his era.  His conclusion is pessimistic: \\"But the day of these artistic anomalies is over.\\"  Further, he considers it most unlikely that any future \\"very long poem will ever be popular again.\\"  Poe expresses amazement that anyone would equate poetic length with poetic merit.<br /><br />  As an alternative to sheer bulk, Poe suggests that a poem's worth might be better judged more by \\"the impression it makes--by the effect it produces.\\"  Poe shows little respect for poets whose primary contribution to verse is the perseverance required to grind out a poem of interminable length.  Oddly enough, he adds that the reverse is not true: \\"It is clear that a poem may be improperly brief.  Undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism.\\"  For Poe, the epigram was a painful reminder of all that was stultifying of what he deemed the heavy-handed Age of Reason.  He quotes Shelley as one who had written verse with such undue brevity.<br /><br />  While Poe does not lament the passing of the \\"epic mania\\" from the public consciousness, he is concerned over a new poetic evil--\\"the heresies of the Didactic.\\"  The term \\"didactic\\" refers to the use of teaching or moral instruction to make a point.  Poe was plainly alarmed at what he saw as a dangerous trend in poetic composition.  Many of his contemporaries envisioned \\"the ultimate object of all Poetry is Truth.\\"  Poe, rather, held that whatever place Truth took in poetry, there were several other far more important barometers of poetic excellence.  He sorrowfully admits that \\"We Americans especially have patronized this happy idea.\\"  To base a poem's evaluation primarily on its alleged \\"Truth,\\" is to deny the intrinsic worth of the poem itself.  Poe does not mean that there is no place for a reduced presence of poetic truth.  His objection lies with poets who insist on placing truth front and center, \\"wreathing her in gems and flowers.\\"  Truth, instead, he notes, must be taken down a peg or two, relegating it to \\"severity rather than efflorescence of language.\\"  The poet truth-teller must weave his tapestry of truth into a \\"simple, precise terse\\" structure.  Such a poet must be \\"cool, calm, unimpassioned.\\"  Those of his contemporaries who failed to acknowledge this were guilty of \\"attempting to reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.\\"<br/><br />  Poe asserts that it is the bounden duty of all poets to engage in a ceaseless struggle to apprehend the Beautiful in life and to record that struggle in their verse.  As a preliminary step, Poe finds it necessary to divide \\"the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious distinctions.\\"  The first is the realm of the Pure Intellect, which concerns itself with the much abused notion of literal Truth.  The second is Taste, which \\"informs us of the Beautiful.\\"  The third is the Moral Sense, which is \\"regardful of Duty.\\"<br /><br />  Poe's apprehension of the Beautiful is not limited merely in acknowledging their existence.  For a poet to write of Things Beautiful may be doing no more than penning a shopping list of them: \\"He who shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however vivid a truth of description, of the sights and sounds, and odors, and colors and sentiments....he, I say, has yet faded to prove his divine title.\\"  Beauty, for Poe, is a reaching outward and upward for all that is immortal in man: \\"It is the desire of the moth for the star.\\"  Thus, appreciation of the Beautiful must be wedded to \\"a wild effort to reach the Beauty above.\\"<br /><br />  This striving for Beauty is not limited to poetry.  Poe notes that the Poetic Sentiment may include the sister arts of painting, sculpture, architecture, dance, and music.  Of these allied arts, only music approaches poetry in the former's usage of rhythm, meter, and rhyme.  Those who are fortunate enough to be moved by words to reach the heights of supernal beauty may be equally moved by the notes of an earthly harp: \\"There can be little doubt that in the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the widest field for the Poetic development.\\"<br /><br />  Poe now presents his often-quoted definition of poetry: \\"I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as the Rhythmical Creation of Beauty.  Its sole arbiter is Taste.\\"  For Poe, there is only a peripheral relation of Intellect and Conscience with poetry, and even less with Duty or Truth.  Only the taste of the poet can permit the reader to experience \\"that pleasure which is at once the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense.\\"  Such pleasure derives from the contemplation of Beauty, which Poe now acknowledges as \\"the province of the poem.\\"  He repeats his earlier belief that though the contemplation of Beauty must reside as the inner core of poetic necessity, there is yet a place, however marginal, for passion, duty, or even truth: \\"It by no means follows, however, that the incitements of Passion, or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons of Truth, may not be introduced into a poem.\\"  His caveat is that \\"the true artist will always contrive to tone them done in proper subjection to that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem.\\"<br /><br />  Poe spends the remainder of his essay considering to what extent various poets embody the tenets of his Poetic Sentiment.  He begins with an excerpt from Longfellow's \\"Waif.\\"  He lauds Longfellow for the \\"delicacy of expression\\" and \\"for the graceful insouciance of its meter.\\"  Poe notes that such gracefulness does not happen by mere happenstance.  Only those who, like Longfellow, possess natural talent may aspire to write so fluidly.  Yet, though Poe praises Longfellow, he still severely rebukes him as one who \\"must necessarily upon many occasions be simply silly, or stupid.\\"<br /><br />  William Cullen Bryant is the second poet that Poe considers.  Poe quotes Bryant's \\"June\\" as an example of a poem whose rhythmical flow is both voluptuous and melodious, both of which combine to produce an intense melancholy that leads to a \\"pleasurable sadness.\\"  The point that Poe is making is to connect Bryant's preoccupation with sadness as the \\"highest manifestation of true Beauty\\" with the corresponding manifestation of his own \\"The Raven.\\"<br /><br />  Next, Poe analyzes several stanzas from EdwardCoate Pinckney's \\"The Health.\\"  Poe sees \\"The Health\\" as tainted however brilliant and spirited it otherwise may be.  This \\"taint\\" Poe ascribes to Pinckney's misfortune both as having been born too far south to suit the whims of a cabal of partisan editors and to his excessive use of hyperbole which is at odds with his enthusiasm.<br /><br />  Poe turns to the \\"Melodies\\" of Thomas Moore, as one whose powers to induce fancy have induced readers to assume mistakenly that fancy is all that there is to the man.  Poe defends Moore as a poet who has both imagination and fancy to him.  As part of his defense, Poe quotes one line from Moore, but strangely regrets that he cannot remember any other lines.<br /><br />  The concept of fancy is noted again, this time in the \\"Fair Ines\\" of Thomas Hood.  Poe admits that Hood's verse in these lines \\"had always for me an inexpressible charm.\\"  Poe quotes a second poem by Hood, \\"The Haunted House,\\" which he terms \\"one of the truest poems ever written.\\"  He praises it highly in terms of its artistry, its theme, and its execution.  However, just as Poe undercut his own defense of Moore, so does he do with Hood.

Poe calls Tennyson \\"the noblest of poets, not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most profound--not because the poetical excitement  which he induces is at all times the most intense--but because it is at all times the most ethereal.\\"  To Poe, \\"ethereal\\" connotes a feeling of sublime elevation.<br /><br />  Poe concludes \\"The Poetic Principle\\" by urging the poet to induce in the reader \\"an elevating excitement of the soul quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason.\\"  Thus, for Poe, the function of the poet is not merely to sense the Beauty of the World, but to reach for it so that the reader may do likewise.lect and Conscience with poetry, and even less with Duty or Truth.  Only the taste of the poet can permit the reader to experience \\"that pleasure which is at once the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense.\\"  Such pleasure derives from the contemplation of Beauty, which Poe now acknowledges as \\"the province of the poem.\\"  He repeats his earlier belief that though the contemplation of Beauty must reside as the inner core of poetic necessity, there is yet a place, however marginal, for passion, duty, or even truth: \\"It by no means follows, however, that the incitements of Passion, or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons of Truth, may not be introduced into a poem.\\"  His caveat is that \\"the true artist will always contrive to tone them done in proper subjection to that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem.\\"           Poe spends the remainder of his essay considering to what extent various poets embody the tenets of his Poetic Sentiment.  He begins with an excerpt from Longfellow's \\"Waif.\\"  He lauds Longfellow for the \\"delicacy of expression\\" and \\"for the graceful insouciance of its meter.\\"  Poe notes that such gracefulness does not happen by mere happenstance.  Only those who, like Longfellow, possess natural talent may aspire to write so fluidly.  Yet, though Poe praises Longfellow, he still severely rebukes him as one who \\"must necessarily upon many occasions be simply silly, or stupid.\\"           William Cullen Bryant is the second poet that Poe considers.  Poe quotes Bryant's \\"June\\" as an example of a poem whose rhythmical flow is both voluptuous and melodious, both of which combine to produce an intense melancholy that leads to a \\"pleasurable sadness.\\"  The point that Poe is making is to connect Bryant's preoccupation with sadness as the \\"highest manifestation of true Beauty\\" with the corresponding manifestation of his own \\"The Raven.\\"           Next, Poe analyzes several stanzas from Edward Coate Pinckney's \\"The Health.\\"  Poe sees \\"The Health\\" as tainted however brilliant and spirited it otherwise may be.  This \\"taint\\" Poe ascribes to Pinckney's misfortune both as having been born too far south to suit the whims of a cabal of partisan editors and to his excessive use of hyperbole which is at odds with his enthusiasm.           Poe turns to the \\"Melodies\\" of Thomas Moore, as one whose powers to induce fancy have induced readers to assume mistakenly that fancy is all that there is to the man.  Poe defends Moore as a poet who has both imagination and fancy to him.  As part of his defense, Poe quotes one line from Moore, but strangely regrets that he cannot remember any other lines.            The concept of fancy is noted again, this time in the \\"Fair Ines\\" of Thomas Hood.  Poe admits that Hood's verse in these lines \\"had always for me an inexpressible charm.\\"  Poe quotes a second poem by Hood, \\"The Haunted House,\\" which he terms \\"one of the truest poems ever written.\\"  He praises it highly in terms of its artistry, its theme, and its execution.  However, just as Poe undercut his own defense of Moore, so does he do with Hood.  After granting that \\"The Haunted House\\" is powerfully ideal and imaginative,\\" Poe immediately adds that he regrets \\"that its length renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture.\\"  Poe now follows with a lengthy excerpt from Hood's \\"Bridge of Sighs,\\" a poem that Poe sees its vigor as \\"no less remarkable than its pathos.\\"  He praises its versification as \\"admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is the thesis of the poem.\\"         Byron is next as Poe quotes from \\"Stanzas to Augusta.\\"  In this poem, Byron's hero has suffered greatly but still has not lost faith in his beloved.  It is this unfaltering belief in the primacy of love that Poe lauds: \\"It is the soul-searching idea that no man can consider himself entitled to complain of fate while in his adversity he still retains the unwavering love of woman.\\"           Tennyson is the last poet to whom Poe will refer.  Poe calls Tennyson \\"the noblest of poets, not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most profound--not because the poetical excitement  which he induces is at all times the most intense--but because it is at all times the most ethereal.\\"  To Poe, \\"ethereal\\" connotes a feeling of sublime elevation.           Poe concludes \\"The Poetic Principle\\" by urging the poet to induce in the reader \\"an elevating excitement of the soul quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason.\\"  Thus, for Poe, the function of the poet is not merely to sense the Beauty of the World, but to reach for it so that the reader may do likewise.
B0036V4DGC|2.0|Eric Woolfson. He is half of the Alan Parsons Project- probably even greater than half.  His voice is the lead on songs like Eye in the Sky, Time and Don't Answer Me.  He recently passed away but in 2004 he was still very much alive.  Alan Parson's voice is nowhere near as great and neither is this punk singing lead, prancing around the stage with his black fingernail polish.  The band and the backing vocals are tight, but not having Eric Woolfson in this is a huge disappointment.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|This headset works very well as everybody says, but I find that after even short gaming sessions my ears are very sore, and I don't have big ears or anything. The small(ish) earcups and light foam do pad a bit, but It does hurt after awhile and it does take away from the experience.
B003INBNXO|3.0|I watched this with my family, who aren't actually interested in martial arts, and they thought it was great.  I also enjoyed it, as I would enjoy almost any kung fu film, but I didn't think it was great, either for its martial arts or its plot elements.<br /><br />My family, especially my mother, was drawn in by the presentation of Ip's interactions with his family at the beginning of the film.  For people who don't know kung fu films and have gotten used to the western anti-heroes, seeing a hero portrayed as a gentlemanly family man is a thrilling experience.  They then found the fighting exciting.  When they found out Ip Man was a real person, they were beside themselves.<br /><br />As for myself, I found this to be a very watchable but tame kung fu film.  It's too ahistorical to be considered an actual biographical portrayal of Ip Man's life, it's too PC vis-a-vis WWII to be dramatically compelling, and the fighting falls in a grey area where it has too much special effect to leave the impression of watching real fighting and not enough special effect to give the pleasure of fantasy fighting.  Although I enjoyed the beginning of the movie as did my family, I found the Japanese tournaments and their resolutions cliche and slightly boring.<br /><br />The main thing this film has going for it are sympathetic characters and quite good acting for the depth of the script.  The sets, costuming, filmography, etc are also well done.  On the down side, the stench of nationalist sentiment hangs about this movie, as it does so much of the entertainment coming out of China today.  Definitely watchable, though, if you like kung fu films and are trying to decide on this one.

0375850864|4.0|When You Reach Me is a very clever, intriguing, and realistic book. It captures many things at once: life in the 1970's, growing up, New York City, the age of \\"latchkey\\" kids, time travel and mystery.     This book is not long, but well-written. The story told is creative and very unique, and a great retelling of a different era. The writing is simple enough for a young child to read and enjoy it, but complex enough for an older reader to enjoy it as well, at a different level.    The story follows Miranda, a young girl living in New York City in 1978 and 1979. The story follows her as she meets and loses friends, helps her mom prepare for a game show she's entering, works at a sandwich shop, and deals with being relatively poor. Along with these (mostly) normal occurrences, there is a mystery as well. Miranda's friend, Sal gets punched by a stranger for no reason whatsoever, and she begins to receive strange notes. The story holds a nice balance between normal things and the imaginative (time travel).     However, I found that the story centered a little bit too much around one particular book that the main character read, making it, at times, a little difficult to understand if you had not read that book (A Wrinkle in Time) first. Also, depending on your reading style and preferences, you may find the story too simply told, but this a matter of opinion.    Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed When You Reach Me, and did not put it down until I'd finished it.

0143116177|5.0|As a graduate of both history, political science and finance, this book reinforces how the rise of finance is the rise of civilisation as we understand it. I wish I had read this during my undergraduate degree as I feel it summarises how, at very important historical turning points, finance was involved in shaping history.     He traces finance from its infancy to the current state of global capital markets. By doing so, he catergorises how civilisation has evolved with financial developments: bond markets, share markets, property markets, insurance and derivatives. These seemingly unrelated fields, as Fegerson highlights, are intimately related. Furthermore, their effects on political economy go far in explaining why policy decisions have had adverse effects in capitalist democracies.     Ferguson able to describe financial phenomenon clearly and concisely. Don't be afraid of the topic matter - this is more a history book than it is a financial textbook.     This book as solidified my worldview and is highly recommended to anyone. Its very existence serves to alleviate much of the financial illiteracy that plagues the developed world.
B004ASVS0E|5.0|As a lifelong Annie Lennox fan, I was at first taken back by the stark lead vocal layer on most of the songs. No reverb, no richness added to the tracks like the \\"Winter Wonderland\\" vocal track of years ago.  Annie chose a voice that one might hear in the days when Christmas Caroling was popular.  A lone voice then joined by layer upon layer of precise, intricate melodies created mostly with Annies vocals but sprinkled with additions by the childrens choir she located in Africa. The arrangement of The Holly and the Ivy rocks with a \\"sing along with me\\" invitation that one cannot resist. The ending of the As Joseph Was a Walking with numerous layers of celestial \\"Alleluyahs\\" is incredible. Well worth the listen and the purchase. And no saxaphones in the bunch, thank you!

B00192IV9U|4.0|Michael Jackson's new album is the quintessential Michael. However, I believe that if MJ was alive he would not have approved its release. For one thing, Michael always had at least 15 songs on his albums. Second, because Michael was a perfectionist, some of the songs were too short and too elementary. MJ would have shown more depth. All in all, I loved this album.
B002ZG98J6|4.0|I knew nothing of this film before watching it and that may have helped me to like it. Being a avid Ray Harryhausen fan, I couldn't help but notice the similarities between this film and Ray's Clash of the Titans and Jason and the Argonauts(certainly not bad company). The film has some super slick FX and impressive Mythology creatures ala Harryhausen(I know he didn't invent them, but he has certainly influenced their appearance of these creatures in films) and it is hard to not think of the starring trio from Harry Potter when watching the young stars of this film. Who can resist the casting of Uma Thurman as Medusa?! Uma is a beautiful woman, but I've always thought she was a little scary looking at the same time. (hehe)<br /><br />It all seemed like familiar territory, but I enjoyed this film much more than I thought I would. If you like Harryhausen's work or Harry Potter, than you might want to give this a shot, it's an entertaining film even if the ending is a little sappy. Oh Hollywood...will you ever learn?

B001I0T92Q|1.0|Do not order from PBXProTech  - (Alpha Bravo Xavier Technology 'Professionals') in case Amazon blocks.  Horrible support, defective item.  I understand some cards fail, but it took them 3 days for them to reply to my first email telling them the card was a dud.  I had given a concise rundown of the steps I had taken, which were above and beyond what their support would soon offer.  After three days, these imbeciles send me a canned email, detailing the same steps I had just said I had done.  I replied back explaining AGAIN that the card was a dud and asked for them to ship a replacement already.  Volunteered to return the 2 dollar card gladly if they'd send a pre-stamped envelope and a replacement.  Waited another day or so, and filed a complaint with Amazon since they weren't replying.  Amazon has given that refund, indicating to me that Amazon has determined they are sketchy.  There is no phone number on their site, and the email I received was in horrible English.  Avoid PBXProTech AT ALL COSTS; THE REVIEWS FOR THEM ARE VERY MISLEADING.

1591843162|1.0|I am a Seth Godin die hard follower. I have read many of his books. But I found this one hard to read. There was no flow to the book, and at times it was so pessimistic and negative, it drained me and put me in lizard mode through out the day. I was happy to skip to the end, but I just was not satisfied and inspired like when I read Tribes and Purple Cow. Something was amiss. I think he tried to hard to develop the definition of indispensable. Buy a used copy.
B000QCQ9O8|4.0|This book was incredible. I am thankful that I read it on the Kindle. McEwan's writing is amazing, but a very difficult read. The Kindle's built-in dictionary helped me with that.

The two are very differant, but equally beautiful, in my opinion.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Let me just say that while reading this book, I had reactions to scenes that I truly felt.  I felt anxious, nervous, frustrated, angry and happy.  The perspective of a 5 year old lends itself to evoking these emotions because this character is innocently intelligent and consistent.  He's smart and ignorant which portrays an inner struggle to hold on to what he knows.  But isn't that true of most people?  They try to hold on to what they know and are ignorant and most times unwilling to learn what they don't know.<br /><br />It's through our characters youth that differentiates himself from most people.  He is able to try...to try and understand an overwhelming amount of new things with a simplicity that is a product of his simple beginnings.  On the other hand, we have the mother who is the complete antithesis of our characters ability to adapt and accept the 'world' around her.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very good read.  It starts of slowly, but once you (like Jack) immerse yourself in Room and identify with all the personified characters and their relationships, you may find yourself thinking about these characters away from 'Book'.
0316098337|3.0|Sorry, this book does not live up to its press.  Jack speaks like he's English, not American, which sounds pretentious for a little American boy. Throughout the book, the characters say \\"bits\\" when they mean \\"parts\\" and at times, \\"bum\\" for \\"bottom.\\"  The news announcer says \\"America\\" when he means \\"United States\\"...Americans are actually aware that the US does not encompass all of both Americas and do not use \\"America\\" in that sense, especially on T.V.....  Americans do not run off to Australia when they want to get away as the grandfather does because they are not Commonwealth citizens and need a visa to live in Australia...and if they did, no American would say \\"He's off to Canberra\\"  because few Americans would know where that is.  An elderly American would most likely go to Florida.    Because of the style of the book, I was confused through most of it since it sounded like the US in its details yet the characters did not speak like Americans.    The mom also gets a bit preachy after she escapes \\"room\\" and comes across as far too educated for someone who was kidnapped when she was 19.      The depiction of Jack's thought process and point of view is engaging, but the sloppy editing means this book is irredeemably flawed.
B000063WDH|5.0|The Black Key's debut, \\"The Big Come up\\" is, what I think, their best work.<br /><br />They are a two man, guitar & drums, band that is about as raw as you can get. They make \\"The White Stripes\\" look like a symphonic orchestra, I mean The BlacK Keys is really raw, in a Hound Dog Taylor type of manner.<br /><br />Guitarist and vocalist Dan Auerbach makes the most out of this limited approach. Even though he is a young man, his vocals evoke that of a  gristled, whiskey-soaked, road veteran.  His guitar playing is sparse and economical yet entirely creative and emotional. He utilizes these gutteral riffs juggling between over distorted, awashed in reverb, heavy on effects and clean to get the most out of this minimalist melodic attack. Despite the sonic manipulations, the guitar always sounds aggressive and raw. Percusionist Patrick Carney also has his work cut out for him because he is not only the backbone, but he has to get a lot more out of his playing then just simple rhythm...and he does. An inevitable comparison to similar sounding band and drummer Meg White of the \\"White Stripes\\" stops right there...there's a lot more music coming out of Carney's drum playing than you would think.<br /><br />All the songs are fantastic and the cd plays great all the way through. There's two nice covers. The Beatle's \\"She said, She said\\" is done perfectly with a balance between preserving the melody and feel of the original yet taking it in a beautifully primal direction. Raw bluesman Junior Kimbrough's \\"Do the Rump\\" is less imaginative but a showcase for how far this duet can take their minimalist approach and explore different textures with their respective intruments. The outro to the song is a great way to close the door. \\"I'll be your man\\" is a highlight and get's to the point of practically being danceable. Likewise, \\"Countdown\\" is a country blues tune that can get a party shaking. \\"Heavy Soul\\" evokes an initial Hendrix-ian feel and that proceeds down a Hound Dog Taylor rump shake. \\"Brooklyn bound\\" somehow, in a unique and unpredictable manner, starts out as a rave-up yet then morphs towards an almost, soul groove. All the songs on this cd are good, all killer no filler.<br /><br />Guitar fanatics should love this since Auerbach's riffing is ridiculously simple yet in an extraordinarily creative way. No shredding yet there's a lot more guitar creativity going on here than on an Yngwie Malmsteen song. Likewise, because of the simplicity, the drums are so much  more vital than in a larger \\"band\\" format.<br /><br />This is the band's debut. They had put out a lot of material since this 2002 work. Because of the obvious creative limitations with this format, they have expanded their sound and added bandmembers/more instrumentation. While the other cds have great songs on it, I think this work, for the \\"raw\\" genre is at it's best.<br /><br />WARNING, while this cd is great and worthy of never coming off your cd player/ipod, I do not feel that it works as well in a live setting. I have seen the Black Keys live twice and frankly, was very bored. In a concert setting, it takes (at least for me) a lot more than two guys banging away at thier instruments to hold my attentiond\\" somehow, in a unique and unpredictable manner, starts out as a rave-up yet then morphs towards an almost, soul groove.

B003L20IFQ|5.0|BURIED is not a film for everyone.  It is a very cerebral piece that requires the audience to enter into a place that is terrifyingly desperate, grow to know the many messages that the main character represents, and be willing to experience a very non-Hollywood ending.  Written with great courage by Chris Sparling and directed with consummate skill by young Spanish director Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s, this film is a challenge for the single character in the film and Ryan Reynolds reaches one of the highest achievements of his career.<br /><br />The time is 2006 in Iraq and Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) works for a trucking company as a contracted civilian. His convoy is attacked and many of his fellow non-military workers are killed: Paul is placed in a coffin and buried, with only a cigarette lighter and a cellphone.  The film begins in the dark, that same dark that surrounds the entrapped Paul who realizes he has limited oxygen supply and must find a way to escape or meet death. He tries to use the cellphone, but encounters the usual monstrous difficulties we all face daily - automated answering machines, operators who insist on unnecessary information before helping him, futile attempts to connect with his family, calls from his attackers demanding ransom to set him free, contact with the government departments who shuffle his requests until the appropriate person is reached who is unable to correctly assist, calls from his employer in the States who demands he give a recorded message relinquishing his rights  and firing him for groundless reasons.  Throughout the 90 minutes that we spend with Paul in the coffin we feel the terror, hear the explosions, feel the agony as he speaks briefly with his wife, leaves a cellphone video for his son, and says goodbye to his nursing home mother suffering from dementia.<br /><br />The ending of the film must be withheld, as it is unexpected.  What the writer and the director and the actor have managed to do in this claustrophobic nightmare is point out many facts about the US involvement in the Middle East - both military and civilian contractors - and hear the reasons behind the situation from the Middle Eastern viewpoint.  It is a very difficult movie to experience but one that is a brilliantly condensed statement about the madness of war.  Ryan Reynolds delivers a performance completely solo and manages to create a wholly unforgettable, completely compelling character that will never leave our mind.

And I've been waiting, impatiently, to load it up with a lot of the classic literature I love. This has been my first stop and I am very happy with this collection. Besides from the content and the plays, which are already amazing, I found the formatting of this Kindle edition to be real easy to read and move around in.  As for the plays themselves, I am so glad I seem to have got more than I originally thought I would get, with these extra plays. Highly recommended.

I love his relationship with Peter. This is a smart show -- which explains the low ratings. It does not involve stupid love/sex stories with cheesy background light rock music (Gray's Anatomy) or a bunch of flash (CSI). It is an awesome show.

157421327X|1.0|I put the blame on myself for buying this without fully investigating it. I am familiar with Suzanne McNeill's other books for Design Basics, and I have never been impressed with their graphic layout: too busy, too disorganized, no real flow. The content ranges from derivative to mediocre to downright simplistic; they are like cotton candy for the brain.     The word \\"Zentangle\\" in the title made me think this book had some connection with the original Zentangle method, but nothing could be further from the truth. These are someone's interpretations of the Zentangle method and design process.     Those who have never heard of Zentangle before would be much better off to buy the originial kit and learn that way.[...]    This book was a waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone.
031603438X|3.0|Parts of the book are entertaining enough, but I do wish Keith had both an editor and a fact-checker.  For example, with regard to his legal trouble in Toronto, he misstates what he was actually charged with.  More than once he refers to the main charge as `trafficking'.  In fact, he was never charged with that, but rather `possession for the purpose of trafficking'.  There is a huge difference between the two.  He's too smart not to understand this, so there must be another motive for such a blatant misrepresentation.  At the time, the assumption was that if you were caught with a significant quantity of dope, you intended to sell it, and the burden fell on you to prove that you didn't.  This led to a constitutional challenge a few years later, but in Keith's case the argument was that someone who made as much as he did from music could not possibly intend to sell the stuff.  The crown recognized that they could not secure a conviction on that charge and wisely dropped it.  They were not looking to `wriggle out' of anything.   In fact, the Crown appealed his sentence he received for the possession charge.  Worse, he implies at the base of page 412 that the Trudeaus were somehow involved in this, and that \\"the Canadian government wanted to wriggle out of it.\\"  This is utter nonsense and a stupid thing to say - there is no way in the world that Pierre Trudeau would involve himself in a criminal case, and Maggie by this time had no influence whatsoever.  On page 414 he tells a touching story of how the order to perform the benefit concerts for the CNIB was the result of a blind fan who went to the judge's house to tell her story.  This, of course, cannot be true.  If in fact she was able to find out who the judge was to be and where he lived (both highly doubtful) the first thing the judge would say is \\"I cannot speak with you\\".  Otherwise, he would risk being removed from his position.   When such obvious things are misrepresented, readers have to question the truthof pretty much everything in the book.  On the whole, it is a fun book to read, but it is not to be taken seriously.  \\"Believe it or not, I haven't forgotten any of it\\", Keith says.  Well, yes, you have, mate.
B000001GAM|5.0|According to the movie The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc, she was in the  confessional, and the priest asks her how is everything with your mother and sister,  and Joan answers  yes there wonderful, which just what this recording is.  I too was surprised that Maestro Guilini  (who entered the Kingdom of Heaven not too many years ago). had a great love for him.  I am just devoted to him.  What an orchestra, what a recording, what a conductor, and what orchestral playing.   Zubin Mehta conducted my first miraculous 8th with the amazing New York Philharmonic and I still talk about it to this day.  It was 1980 at the Kennedy Center. This should be  textbook standard for anyone wanting to at least be contenders for a Bruckner   hall of fame performing champions.  Nothing more I can say except I am glad  this is in my collection.  The miraculous 8th with the out of this world orchestra  is on my list to get too.  Enjoy everyone.  Shame for devoted Bruckner followers who  don't have this.

B003ZTQN1I|2.0|I agree with all those who are disappointed in this CD.  How can it say Original Motion Picture Soundtrack when it is not?! I am not a big country music fan but I really liked the music in this movie. I just purchased the soundtrack and unfortunately I didn't read the artist for each song. I thought since it said \\"Orignal Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" that it would be the original songs as performed in the movie. I especially liked the song Give In to Me in the movie and I can't believe that it is Faith Hill singing it on the \\"soundtrack\\" instead of Garret Hedlund & Leighton Meester like it was done in the movie. That along with the other changes made to the songs on the CD, makes it NOT the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.

B000FCK8ZK|4.0|We never had Showtime, so didn't get into the Dexter series until the first 2 seasons were available for instant watch on Netflix.  We were hooked from episode one, and didn't get any sleep for the next two weeks while we hungrily devoured each episode.  So since season 3 is not instant watch, and it's further down the queue, I turned to the books to get my Dexter fill.  The book follows the first season of Dexter fairly closely.  There are parts of the season that you can tell after reading the book that were Hollywood-ized, such as Debra's relationship with the Ice Truck Killer, and Lieutenant La Guerta's involvement-or lack thereof, heh heh heh.  (You'll get this when you finish the book.)<br /><br />What I really enjoyed about this book that you don't get as much of on Showtime, is how much deeper into Dexter's head I can get.  Because the story is told from Dexter's perspective, I can understand more clearly how 'inhuman' he sees himself, and I can see what is really going on between him an Rita from his point of view.<br /><br />The book was an easy read, and doesn't take much brain to comprehend.  It was a lot of fun though!

B000W40PPE|4.0|I downloaded a sample--this is the old version.  The new version is out but apparently not for Kindle. I have the old hardcopy, and I lost 2-3 pounds a week and was never hungry.  Doctors would tell me I didn't have impulse control when it came to food.  It turns out that is just BS, but was down on myself for years because I was hungry all the time.  A co-worker was supposed to go on statins and didn't want to.  I convinced him to try this for 6 weeks.  His cholesterol plummeted.  He lost 25 pounds over a few more weeks and his cardiologist was AMAZED that diet could do that.      I only give it 4 stars because I didn't much care for the recipes and would have preferred more discussion.  I want to get the newer edition, which addresses some objections such as using flax oil to cook.  I never did use flax oil because the taste is too strong.

B0017OB12O|5.0|What more can be said about this movie? It is a classic, possibly one of the greatest films ever made. On the whole the storyline is rather simple, but the way it is told; how it is captured on film and the riveting acting it contains, makes this film far more tha a \\"classic\\" movie.<br /><br />When I first saw this movie at about the age of ten projected at the local library on 16mm film, I laughed at Alec Guinness' portrayal of Col. Nicholson, I thought he was playing a very funny character. Many years later, I now believe that Alec Guinness' tremendous performance, probably the greatest of his magnificent career, is the greatest comic performance ever. I'm sure many will condemn me for saying this, some will say, \\"Wow, he's missed the point,\\" or whatever, but I stand by my evaluation. Since my first viewing of this movie, I have learned things about its filming and Alec Guinness that I feel proves my point.<br /><br />David Lean, must get much of the credit of this glorious film. The look, the feel, and the actors' performances were all tempered by Lean. The film is a masterpiece of story telling, with great performances by Jack Hopkins, William Holden, Sessue Hayakawa and of course Guinness, this film is still amazing after all these years.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition looks pretty good, but the Special Features are somewhat lacking. They do have about an hour long making of documentary, but for a film of this extraordinary quality, it could have used some better behind-the-scenes features. Roll out some old interviews with Lean, Guinness or others, whatever, but more than what they have. All the same I give the film and blu-ray 5 Stars!
0684833395|4.0|This was an extremely entertaining novel.  It embodied the social atmosphere of bomber squadrons in World War II and captures the absurdidy of bureaucratic nonsense going on among the higher ranking officers.

067182449X|5.0|I read this book in the 9th grade of high school my final grade of the year and it was great. I found out that it was being sold on amazon.com. I bought this book and read it all over again and really got the whole idea of what Anne Frank went through. She and her family had to go into hiding so that Anne or her sister and her mother would not be captured by the Nazi's and taking to the concentration camps. Anne and her family were living in a 2 room hiding spae along with another family. I some parts of the book were very tearful and other parts would make you think, Thank God this was not me back then and the sad part is, when  Anne Frnak was released from hiding she died 2 months later. This book gave you an inside idea what is was like back then. This book is a must read book. Everyone that buys this book, it not money wasted. I will be the best amount of money spent on a book. I am glad that I bought this book.
B000000OUJ|5.0|There are enough in depth reviews here on Amazon to read so I'm gonna keep this one simple to skeptical buyers..BUY THIS ALBUM!    Anyone who claims to like hip hop MUST own this album. Liquid Swords is easily one of the top 5 greatest albums of all time. The combination of GZA's flow and RZA's production is so unique that it gives me goosebumps sometimes.  I have listened to this album all the way through at least 60 times and every time it sounds better than the last.  Most decent albums get old after a while, so when you find one that NEVER gets old, you know it's special. Today's so called \\"hip hop\\" is straight garbage compared to Wu Tang and the gems that they have pumped out.

0374290024|3.0|This is a contribution to the body of writings addressing the question of why the \\"West\\" rose and came to dominate the \\"rest\\". This is a question that has interested scholars - especially Western scholars - for at least a hundred years. Different answers have been produced. Some early scholars looked to biological superiority although there are few takers for this line of thinking these days - expect in far right fringe groups. Others look to cultural attributes such as the Protestant work ethic (Weber and RH Tawney) but also more general attributes of Western Christendom going back to the Middle Ages (David Landes).  Karl Marx emphasised the importance of the development of industrial capitalism in the West in making it a leader. Another school looks at material factors such as the easy availability of coal in places like England (Pomeranz) or the discovery of the Americas and the \\"free kick\\" provided to the West in the harnessing its resources (Pomeranz and Frank).    For Morris, the answer is geography. This does not mean a crude geographic determinism that permanently locks in advantage. Rather, while the West has led in social development, that is the sum competencies of a society for at least 14 millennia according to Morris, the \\"East\\" not the West led between 550CE and about 1775CE. It was \\"brute material forces\\" determined by geography and their intersection with social factors that explains the waxing and waning of the respective leads of \\"East\\" and \\"West\\".      The authors methodology is to assess and rate on a numeric scale the respective capabilities of West and East over a long period by means of a number of measures. These are energy capture (manifested for example in the ability to produce goods and deploy force), urbanisation (as a proxy for organisational ability), the ability to process information and the ability to deploy military force. He uses this to construct a kind of historical human development index to measure the capability of societiesover millennia. This of itself is an ambitious task and resembles Angus Maddison's work to construct a measure of the size of economies in the past including the distant past.       The author commences his argument by looking at what he says were the natural advantages of the \\"hilly flanks\\" area in the Middle East, namely the wider variety of crops and animals available for domestication compared with other parts of the world and more favourable climate. The argument is that these circumstances gave the Western descendants of the Hilly Flanks an early advantage. He goes on to survey the subsequent rise of the two \\"Western cores\\", namely Mesopotamia and Egypt to show an early lead for the West in the achievements of these two societies.  The East then plays catch up and by the time of the Han Dynasty had just about caught up.      The advantage given to the West by access to the resources of the Americas which were easier to get to from Western Europe than the Middle East or China is the key turning point giving the West its later advantage. It goes on to develop this advantage and eventually crowns it in the nineteenth century with the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution allows the West (led by England) to accumulate huge amounts of wealth and power and use this to dominate the East and the rest of the world.     That advantage however is short lived. The East is quick to absorb and assimilate the technological and organisational capabilities of the West and begin rolling back the tide - even without the advantage of American resources or an equivalent. Japan leads the way with its crash programme of modernisation commencing in the 1870s. China begins modernising in the 1950s and India in the 1990s. He sees India's lag as a product of the fact that it was directly colonised by the West so holding it back. China and Japan avoided this fate and could begin to modernise earlier. He sees the West's lead rapidly coming to an end. Some scholars refer to this process as the \\"Great Convergence\\" as a mirror to what is called the \\"Great Divergence\\" when the West after the 1770s took the lead.      The attempt made by Morris to answer the question he poses is interesting. He covers vast ground and collects together a huge amount of information. This of itself makes his book worth reading although for anyone with some basic knowledge of world history, there might be too much basic information that is not really necessary to make the points that Morris wishes to make. There is also nothing really new in his ideas (other than perhaps use of a historic HDI) but his work is an easy to read synthesis of other writings. Morris however makes a good case to convince the reader that in the end it is not matters of culture and race that matter but the \\"brute material\\" elements, consideration of which he skilfully weaves into the narrative to explain why some develop faster than others and achieve dominance. In this regard, Morris may be closer in his broad approach to that of Frank, Pomeranz and Jack Blaut than the cultural determinism of David Landes and Max Weber, particularly his emphasis on the key advantages gained by Europe in first getting to the Americas and harnessing its resources to get one over the \\"East\\".     The main weakness of the book is the focus on Europe and North America on the one hand and China on the other as the basis for his argument. If the task is to explain who led and why, the limits that the author places on his enquiry - which he himself admits - becomes problematic, in particular, the omission of any serious consideration of India and Islam. For parts of the period in question, there is a strong case that India was the leader not China or the West. India not China contained the world's largest economy for much of the period after 200BCE and held that position until the early modern times according to data complied by the economist Angus Maddison. That economic power was also mirrored by the cultural pull of India - \\"soft power\\" we would say these days - from the time of the Mauryas. Indian culture and influence spread far afield - into South East Asia, Central Asia and even China. Chinese or Western influence at the time did not have so wide a reach - as Morris acknowledges. Indian science was also widely admired and studied for example at the House of Wisdom in Abbasid Baghdad and in China. There is little evidence of a reverse movement of knowledge and ideas until much later strongly suggesting that the \\"centre\\" at the time arguably lay in India at least until the Tang era in China and the Abbasid in the Middle East. India therefore was at least as much a leader if not more so during the earlier period in question.     The omission of Islam also is a deficiency even if there is greater coverage of Islam than of India. Under the Ummayads and Abbasids, a case for Islam as the leader can also be made in all fields using measures of economic power, political power and cultural reach. During the High Middle Ages, it was Westerners who studied Arabic and learnt from Islamic science rather than the converse. It was also the case that the Islam by the end of the period had established dominance in India and parts of Europe and was banging at the gates of China. Even in the sixteenth century, the Ottomans arguably were the dominant political power in Europe not Spain or the Austrian Hapsburgs.     A narrative based on the Euro-American and Chinese world may not therefore be   well suited to addressing the basic question posed. \\"Who lead and why?\\" Morris' narrative is  the \\"G-2\\" version. A \\"G-20\\" version might do better in dealing with the subject. The work of world history by the father and son McNeill team \\"The Human Web\\" might better answer the question at hand using a much broader canvass even if this work of history does not expressly set out to answer the question posed by Morris.    There is also a question of what Morris means by the \\"West\\". He makes the statement that for all but two of the last 14 millenia, the West has led the way. This statement requires inclusion of the Fertile Crescent area of the Middle East as belonging to the \\"West\\". This no doubt accurately reflects the canonical view where the story of the West is said to begin in Mesopotamia. However, the problem is that what is today the Islamic world of the Middle East also traces its beginnings to the same roots and arguably has a better claim to these roots as theirs rather than belonging to the \\"West\\". Mesopotamia was also linked to the beginnings of Indian culture in the cities of the Indus with a direct and more immediate connection than that of Europeans to Mesopotamian culture. Indeed, it is not uncommon to understand the entire area of the Fertile Crescent and the areas of Iran and the Indus Valley as a common hearth where agriculture and urbanisation underwent a common process of development. Mesopotamia in this sense belongs more to the Middle Eastern \\"core\\" (Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Anatolia and the Levant) and to a lesser extent India, than it does to Euro-America. Morris seems to deal with this problem at times by implying a broader concept of what is the \\"West\\" by including in it Europe as well as the Middle East. This is an idea that deserves further exploration going against the usual definition of what is the \\"West\\".     What though do Asians and Africans make of the whole debate? Intriguingly, the best known writings on the question \\"why did the West lead\\" come from Western sources. There appears to be a lacuna in scholarship on the problem by the \\"rest\\". The answer as to what the rest thought however may be found most easily not in the work of scholars but in the writings of early Asian and African nationalists and nation builders. They did in fact address the question in detail and come up with some answers. The question for them was \\"How did the West do it?\\" and the complementary question of \\"what do we need to do to catch up?\\" For the Chinesereformers during the late Qing era, the Meiji era Japanese and nineteenth and twentieth century Indian reformers, it was a matter of mastering and applying Western technology and institutions in a selective way without the need to assume Western culture as such. No large non-Western society saw the solution to the problem of \\"catching up\\" in a wholesale absorption of Western culture such as through conversion to Christianity. They gave a more narrowly focused attention to  technology and selective adoption of Western institutions. Indeed, it cannot be said that those who have adopted Western religion and culture in a more wholesale manner such as in Christian Africa or the Philippines have as a result acquired advantages over those who have not done so - such as Japanese, Indians (and even Chinese despite their adoption of Marxist-Leninism for a while).      The proof of the pudding lies in the eating in that the simple formula used first by the Japanese has proved effective including China and India of today.  These societies have narrowed the gap or caught up without taking to heart the message of Max Weber, David Landes or RH Tawney. Non-Western nation builders have narrowed or closed the gap not by reading Calvin's institutes but by paying attention to and reading engineering and science manuals - and also adopting some of the instruments of social mobilisation first used in the West, importantly the nation state and all its trappings. Morris' emphasis on brute material forces therefore adds up when tested against the actual record is asking why do societies rise and fall. Indeed, Morris at the end of his book  poses the complementary question \\"How did the rest start catching up\\"?  The simple formula pioneered by the Japanese and followed by others comes close to the answer - and this becomes apparent to anyone in the world of business who has some first hand knowledge of the rapid industrialisation of China and India - even just in witnessing what was one day afield worked by farmers becoming an efficient modern factory virtually overnight. This happens against a context of largely continuity and evolution of the local culture. The same forces that allowed the West to rise went on to allow the rest to catch up or start catching up - without the wealth of the Americas.    Finally, there is another question. Why did the West at the point of its dominance have to let go of its empires in Asia and Africa? As the leader by such a margin employing the four point index suggested by Morris, should the West have not been able to easily hold on using its huge advantages? However, it did not. This may suggest that Morris' indexes of capability need to be tested further to explain how a less capable society through mobilisation of its own (on Morris' argument) lesser resources can get rid of the more capable society's political dominance? The answers may involve more than just an aggregation of quantifiable material capabilities as a survey of the history of colonial nationalist movements and their eventual success against powerful Western empires suggests. How the weaker can overcome the stronger is not easily understood using Morris' index. If history could indeed be reduced to the ability to understanding its processes through a capability index, this would make the historian's task so much easier - but less satisfying. If there is a master key to history, it may not be reducible to a capability index of the kind devised by Morris (and he does not make that claim) - and that master key is yet to be found.

My motto is if I start a book I always finish it. I think I've only put down 2 books and that was because I couldn't stomach it. One was \\"A TIME TO KILL ( I just couldn't get pass the first chapter when I saw which way it was going )<br />The other was CROSS COUNTRY-both John Grisham.<br /><br />I have been telling all my co-workers how disappointed I am in this book. It just kept dragging on and on about nothing. I kept saying to myself in the beginning is this really on the best sellers list?<br />I have made it my point to tell everyone that asks me to not buy this book.<br /><br />I will say that 3/4 into the book it gets interesting but a it shouldn't take you that long to figure out what's going on. The other thing that was a turn off to me is all the S & M and how twisted the book is. If I had known that was in the book I would have NEVER bought it.

B0000508U6|3.0|Coldplay released \\"Parachutes\\" on July 10th of 2000.  The mature sound makes it difficult to view it as a debut album, but when compared to their more recent efforts it does come up a bit short, and the band itself doesn't seem to care for the album.  Despite that, there are several tracks which are fan favorites and it is certainly not a bad album.  The lyrics are positive, and the music is a bit moody which has become the band's signature style.  The album was almost completely produced by Ken Nelson, who gave the band the freedom to explore who they were.  There is one track, \\"High Speed\\" which was produced by Chris Allison who was to be the producer on their first album, but the band wanted more control and a more cooperative environment between themselves and their producer so they made the switch to Nelson.    The album opens with \\"Don't Panic\\", which is a short piece, but which was released in some countries as the fourth single from the album.  It provides a good opening for the album.  The second track, and first single in the U.K. (2nd in the U.S.) is \\"Shiver\\" which shows the influence that Jeff Buckley had on Coldplay.  \\"Spies\\" is next, a bit different sort of lyric and feel than most of their songs, but it still fits well.  \\"Sparks\\" is the next track, a bit weaker than the other tracks, both lyrically and musically, it is still pleasant.  \\"Yellow\\" closes the first half of the album.  It is the second single in the U.K., and first in the U.S. from the album.  The tune is catchy, though I find the lyrics rather weak.  Nevertheless, the song remains one of the best known Coldplay pieces, and despite the lyrical weakness I still enjoy it.    \\"Trouble\\" is the start of the second half of the album.  The third single from the album, and a moving piece about doing things you regret to those you love.  The title track is next, and at 46 seconds this is by far the shortest piece on the album and an unusual choice to pick for the title song.  \\"High Speed\\" is next,a song about trust and confidence in the person with whom you are having a relationship.  \\"We Never Change\\" is a song about how we often don't take the best path in life, even when we know what it is, because we are who we are.  \\"Everything's Not Lost\\" is the last track on the album, but there is a hidden piece called \\"Life is for Living\\" which is at the end of the 7+ minute track.    Coldplay consists of Guy Berryman, Jon Buckland, Will Champion and Chris Martin, who are credited with all the songs on the album.  \\"Parachutes\\" is a good album, but there isn't as much diversity on it as I would like, and they are more adventurous on later albums.  I would give this CD around 3½ stars, but I am rounding down in this case because I think it is slightly closer to 3 than 4 stars.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|Great movie! Lots of action, excellent animation, good story telling, and some well placed humor. Even though it's not Kevin Conroy voicing Batman or Mark Hamill voicing the Joker, the voice acting was well done and suited the characters. Lets hope there are more animated Batman movies done with this kind of quality. Disc 2 gives you even more extras, which I always find interesting as you get to see an inside look at the story along with a couple episodes of the Batman Animated Series. If you are looking at purchasing this movie you might as well get the 2 disc edition since it is only .50 cents more than the single disc (at this time).
B000YCLRBA|5.0|I have been listening to Onegin for over 20 years on CD but this was the first time I actually bought the DVD. I missed the live broadcast in theaters but the DVD on wide screen TV is the next best option. I just can't have enough of it. The opera is based on a beautiful love story by Pushkin that Tchaikovsky transformed into an immortal opera. The melodies are Tchaikovskian at their best and beautifully match the scenes and moods of story line. The performances of major characters by Fleming, Hvorostovsky and Vargas are breath-taking despite two of them being non-Russian (Fleming,Vargas). I specially was taken by Ms. Fleming's performance. My first Onegin recording had Irina Arkhipova in Filipyevna role and I was amazed as how well Ms. Fleming held a candle to the great Russian opera singer. Ms Fleming is not only a great singer but an excellent actress too as she melds into the role of a 16 year old Russian girl so beautifully that you loose sight of her being much older. The dramatic impressions by the characters more than make up for the lack of elaborate decor in most of the scenes. Though the story-line is somewhat sad, it is one of Tchaikovsky's happier operas as compared with Mazeppa, Iolante or Queen of Spades. The sad irony is that Pushkin himself was killed in a duel in much the same way as Lensky's character in the opera. I tell my friends &#34;if you just want to see one opera in your life-time, make it Evgeny Onegin. You won't regret it.&#34;

B001PU8N0I|5.0|Well, for those of you who are capable of enjoying a show with no profanity, nudity, car bombs, broken bones and trails of blood, then you might want to check this not so mini, mini-series out.  Uncanny performances abound, most notably from veteran actor Matthew Macfadyen (Pride and Prejudice--the version with Keira Knightley) and adorable newcomer Claire Foy--she is certainly one to watch out for in the future, so much talent its disgusting! :-). The screenplay is expertly woven out of Dicken's classic novel and sucks you in with insidious seduction--but thats a good thing because when you finish watching this series you feel uplifted and educated...something that Hollywood no longer cares for.  If you are an educated, literary type, akin to stories of substance and depth, then you probably enjoy Jane Austin.  Well, if you enjoy Jane Austin then don't think about it any longer...buy this dvd series.  If you liked Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility (BBC's latest version is my favorite thus far) then you will certainly get your money's worth with this set (the story progression, time period--Charles Dickens being born on the 7th of February 1812 and Austin on the 16th of December, 1775--as well as the characters, seem as though they could just as easily arisen from the mind of Austen as they did Dickens--the two seem to have been cut from the same cloth in at least this respect).  If you like Austin then you probably like Dickens, and vice versa, whether you know it yet or not.  Enjoy!
B000UPGQQW|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies since I was a teenager.  It was interesting watching it again as a conscious woman because I had a deeper understanding of the message. I'm glad to have it in my movie collection especially at a nice price :) Thanks Amazon!!
0385341679|5.0|This series was amazing.  I was also afraid to read the last book as some reviewers have also stated.  Karen is an amazing author, and although she made us wait a year, after a very upsetting cliff hanger at the end of book 4, the wait was worth it.  I love they way she completed Mac's story.  There were so many twists and turns.  Just when you thought one way, another way opened up.  I can't wait for more stories in the Fever world.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary has many plusses but the most important one is that you don't need to understand the financial world. If you ask a friend what is a credit default swap and its pitfalls it's doubtful they know what a CDS is, let alone the problems. Well you will easily know what they are by the time this documentary is over. And I mean easy. Clearly you see greed in its worse portrayal by people that truly don't care about anything else, definitively so. Every American should see this documentary and don't think for a minute they are not plotting the next scheme to keep their greed fixes sustained. One man, one woman, in the executive office cannot alone stop this...it's a call to arms to remember we are the people. You can understand the financial dealings and know why they were against you...take a chance. This remarkable documentary makes it crystal clear for Americans without any financial knowledge. My young kids got it!
0312600844|3.0|I sure was relieved to finish reading Jonathan Franzen's Freedom. For one thing, the ending was satisfying in ways I never thought possible while Patty and Walter Berglund were slogging through their respective hells. For another thing, finishing reading Freedom ended my own hell slogging through Franzen's various political and pet-project rants.    Reading Freedom caused me a fair amount of discomfort throughout. Yes, Franzen's rants annoyed me so much, I lost count of how often I almost abandoned the book. Had not the other discomforts held me, however, I would have quit reading long before page 562. Patty and Walter, their children, and friends epitomized the last 50 years of American culture. Often the picture wasn't pretty, but I became entwined in the plot because I lived it, some of it literally, some figuratively, some in my own home, some next door.     I came to care about both Patty and Walter, who having been deeply, bleedingly, scarred in different ways by the sixties' sexual revolution and government mistrust, could not seem to find inner peace in any endeavor. Walter's finding comfort in his son's doing the \\"right\\" thing by donating ill-gotten gains to a charity rather than confessing his illegal money-making scheme showed alarmingly how \\"situational ethics\\" is just a raft floating downstream to be tossed by the rapids rather than a raft anchored in a harbor. Franzen captured current culture well (God help us!).    I can't say I liked the whole book, but I liked parts of it very much. I liked the way Franzen unpacked complex motives. Although the ancestral stories fragmented the flow of the main story, I liked their showing how we rebel and conform to the previous generation, how we repeat and avoid their mistakes, and in the end, each generation is just as human as the generation before. The reflective reader would ask himself how s/he might be like or unlike Patty and Walter, their siblings, and children. Freedom's family resentments rippled throughmy memories to prickle raw nerve endings--also one of the discomforts that kept me reading. And I kept plodding through Freedom's forest of too-many-words in hope of stumbling into a beautiful sunlit clearing revealing a golden Franzen nugget like \\"It was the season of migration, of flight and song and sex\\" or \\"impeccably quirky\\" and other well-crafted descriptions.    Bottom line: I'm glad I stuck with this book until the end.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Angelina was great in this movie.  She is in nearly all of her movies.  So glad I bought it.
B004G6009K|5.0|I took my soon to be 8 year old to se this a s a treat for doing well in school. Not only was this a treat for her. but it was for me too!! I laughed and cryed and booed! I recommend anyone who loves a good warm and witty Disney flick to just buy this!! Don't even bother renting it :)
1594202842|5.0|I was so ready to hate this book but, I ended up loving it and I think all parents should read it.  The book is good natured and honest....Amy Chua had my attention from beginning to end and honestly, I was sad to get to the last page.  This book inspired one of my blog entries [...] and it was such a great book to share, with my 12 year old daughter.  Whether you agree with her or despise her, it's still worth reading.....the excerpts just don't cut it....read the book!
1439152780|5.0|This book starts off a little slow but please dont give up once you get  more into the book you realize what a great author this is. She did a great job of putng this book together and capturing the readers attention through the whole thing. Im definitely going to read her other two books and I hope theyre as good as this one.
B001NLKT60|2.0|I read \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" and thought it was okay, but did not really understand all the praise.  Perhaps it IS the best book translated into English that year, but otherwise there is nothing extraordinary about it.  There are lots of British and American writers who are writing books better than this.  Anyway, somewhere I heard or read that the first book was the worst, but the series as a whole was great...  I got this on audio book.  It is the most boring thing.  The author just goes on and on about stuff.  For example, you hear about what happens when people have a stroke and then you get several pages of the narator describing a person going through this, then a long description of a loved one watching them, then the actual person describing it, then the doctor...this goes on for an hour, and the character who had a stroke is only a minor character.  When we are introduced to characters we get a tome of info on them including their complete employment and criminal history, including the dates of arrest.  Later, if a police man or other investigative character should come across the character we get to hear it all over again.  Usually these are characters who don't really matter.  You feel as if you are getting a lot of completely unnecessary, random, and ridiculous details about characters during a critical plot moment like, \\"she loved the color blue.  Blue is in the color spectrum between green and indigo.  when she was a toddler she had a toy that was blue, she loved it.  She really liked wearing blue pants because they are dark enough to not show stains, but not black which is really drab.\\".  This is not an actual quote From the book.  If it were, it would go on for three more pages.  It is just really boring...
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I will watch this movie every Christmas as part of my holiday ritual - That's how much I love this movie.
B00447G2PM|5.0|I keep reading reviews about 3D movies that are all over the place, this movie is one of the good ones.  So now that I have my new Asus laptop, I'm simply blown away by the quality of some 3D movies and the lack of standards of what some are pitching as a 3D movie.  I also can't believe the lack of content, what the heck?  After spending an hour reading the reviews of all the 3D movies on Amazon, I decided to go to best buy to pick one up, it's the same price and i get it now.  But I usually get my stuff from Amazon.  This movie/documentary was amazing at times it felt like I was looking at my real life aquarium, but with many more fish of course and at times it felt like I was back on Maui swimming with the fish. I put headphones on and I lost myself in the beauty for an hour and the documentary part of it was nothing short of amazing as well.  You could see every spec of fish no matter how small, at times it looked like you are in the middle of it all and the coral looked like you could reach out and touch it.    Looking forward to other 3D movies, as of now it looks like another IMAX movie will be my next stop.  But I keep looking for that adventure 3D film that will define 3D for me.
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|This is not a movie for people  who are looking for a deep, thought provoking two hours.  It's for people who are looking for fun, pure fun.  It's also for people who are Meryl Streep fans.  It's obvious how much fun these A List actors are having with this material.  I read somewhere that Colin Firth has said this movie was the most fun he ever had making a movie.   The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because it is a bit jarring when the songs don't quite fit the situation.  It's obvious that the plot was written around the songs.  Musicals work best when the songs are written around the plot.  But these are some truly inventive, playful and joyful tunes and the choreography is fresh and energetic.  It's just for fun A One!
B003YLM780|5.0|This classic movie has always been a favorite of mine and I finally bought it so I could watch it whenever I want.  It is the original movie that had \\"White Christmas\\" in it, but it is an all year long movie because it has songs for every holiday!  Bing Crosby singing and Fred Astaire dancing...what more could you ask for in a classic movie???
B003EYVXYG|1.0|I've been a big fan of George Romero for years & have seen the majority of his films.  Unfortunately, this is one I wish I hadn't seen.  Some of Romero's more recent movies (Diary of the Dead & Land of the Dead) were a little silly, but I ended up enjoying them just the same.  I gave Survival of the Dead a fair shot, but I just couldn't get into it.  The story seemed flimsy to me, and the characters were predictable.  The acting was a bit off at times as well.  Do yourself a favor and take the reviews on this movie seriously.  I wish I had.
0446615641|4.0|This is another in the Baldacci series of Camel Club adventures. It does not matter what order you read them, they all stand alone. In this caper Baldacci intertwines two fast paced yarns. We have a casino mogul who is beyond evil, bent on revenge for his falling for a long con and a short con, managed by an estranged daughter and father team.     Then we have the expected advance of the Camel Club.  The genesis is an unrelated set of murders of former Oliver Stone colleagues. The Intelligence chiefs get the idea that Stone is the killer since there are many marks of an experienced assassin. However the back story is more complicated, we have to go back to the last bad days of the Soviet Union. A lot of us, including President Reagan, considered it good fortune that the leaders of the USSR were geriatric geezers prone to short terms with no achievements.  Apparently there was more to this than coincidence and the vagaries of our term on this planet.    The Cold War went on so long that we need to let some of the killing fall to the second generation of spies. Now we have an independent contractor killing Stone's colleagues.  Fortunately all the good guys end up on one side and the Intelligence chiefs see the tables turned. To keep renewing the Camel Club roster, we lose one member but gain some new ones, so the Baldacci children will not need to worry about food on the table for some time.     Overall these are fun books to read.  This one is probabaly the best of the series. Baldacci is remarkably clever in bringing two unrelated stories together to an unexpected result.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I don't understand the negitive reviews for this book. Some have even been overly exaggerated. This is a highly imaginative and intriguing story with unforgettable characters. Brilliant writting. Introduces you to each character with their own story, then you discover how each puzzle piece fit into place at the same time, trying to find answers to an unsolved disappearance, realizing...there is much more than expected. This is a must read and if you don't, you are missing out. This, by far, is one of the best books I have ever read. I will definately be reading the other two in the series.
B00006WKY9|4.0|When I think of Taken by Force, it reminds me of Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny in the fact that while it's not one of their best albums, its best songs are so good that it deserves a high rating. It was here where you really see the Scorpions becoming Klaus Meine and Rudolf Schenker's band rather than Uli John Roth's as the latter had less writing credits than before and had no lead vocals (at least on the original version). Of Roth's three contributions is an all-time metal classic in \\"The Sails of Charon\\", a wicked song that features not only his most memorable riff but arguably his best guitar solo. \\"Steamrock Fever\\" is one of the band's great early anthems while the aggressive \\"He's A Woman, She's a Man\\" is a sure precursor to speed metal, particularly in the chorus. And speaking of precursors, \\"We'll Burn The Sky\\" is clearly a sign of things to come as its slow burn would lead to memorable songs like \\"Still Loving You\\" while its riff is very similar to \\"Big City Nights\\" (both off their most successful release, Love At First Sting). The remaining tracks are okay but the funky \\"Your Light\\" and \\"The Riot of Your Time\\" don't touch anything on In Trance or Virgin Killer respectively, the best of the Roth era albums. Still, this is a fine album and its best moments are among the best in `70s metal.
B003EY7IRC|2.0|After reading and loving the earlier books in this series, I eagerly awaited this last one. I was disappointed. The earlier books were action packed and the sexual chemistry was intriguing. This book meandered all over the place and did not keep my attention. The sexual chemistry between the characters was stale introducing nothing new. The plot was slow and kept leading to dead ends and the rehashing of earlier events in other books was tedious. The character development stalled and Mac spent way too much time on depressing introspection. This was not a rollercoaster read for me...more like a long depressing read with unsatisfying results.
B002JM1VJG|3.0|Let's face it without music videos Madonna's music career would not have been what it is today. When I first heard Warner Bros. were doing a retrospective of her career by releasing Celebration, I felt a good video collection would be indispensable. Then would I heard it was going to be a double cd and a double dvd release, I actually was beginning to really look forward to it.     I'm going to say bluntly that Warner Bros. missed their chance to release a tight comprehensive collection here. I understand putting Madonna's 20 plus years of making music into one release is quite a feat! But this could've have been better selected. My question is where is the logic to leaving out Oh Father and Bad Girl!? Both videos are brilliantly done and even the naysayers would have to agree with that. What's the point of dropping those and leaving in the more cute but forgettable videos like Love Profusion and Get Together?! And don't even get me started on the censorship that was placed on the Justify My Love video! For an artist who stood up to censorship almost her whole career...it's blasphemy!    But in the end, it's a fine way to remember why we were once head over heels for this woman and that raw artistic sensibility we just couldn't deny.    Much respect to Madonna!
1439177783|5.0|I could not put this book down. It is a brutally honest book about a beautiful woman. Her whole self worth was based on how much she weighed. I watched Ally McBeal and always thought Portia was the most beautiful girl on the show. I would never have dreamed that she thought she was fat. I recommend this book to all women. Portia is an inspiration!
B000FZETKC|5.0|Her absolute favorite movie of all time.  I've never seen it, but take her word for it for what you will.
B0038Z5T4Q|5.0|Awesome flick. I have the first one almost memorized and I very much liked this sequel. Great acting, nice plot, good characters and a very satisfying ending.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Who doesn't love to only have to work out for 20 minutes a day AND see results. While I am not over weight, this video sure is helping me to tone up and get ready for bikini season. I am also only doing the video every other instead of everyday and I am seeing results. The one thing I don't like about it is that Jillian has a tendenacy to talk just a little too much and does really do the whole work out herself.
B001FB5634|4.0|Grim, grim story that cuts everything down to the basics in a post-Apocalyptic world.  I'll only briefly go over the plot (You can get the plot from the other reviews), but I want to say that I really liked Viggo Mortenson's role as a father protecting his still decent son, and their relationship, in a near-hell of a world.<br /><br />Now YOU imagine that something Apocalyptic happens -- like nuclear winter.  Decent people then have to survive.  But as the lack of food continues year after year, the worst elements of society gain power and start raping and killing families, and cannibalizing people.  How are you going to fight that?  Well if you can't, you'd better commit family suicide, or your kids are going to get raped and eaten. (A Really, really Grim thought!) This horrible thought is the chilling element behind everything in the film.  The boy's mother (Theron) realizes that they are down to only 2 bullets in the family revolver, and with the Cannibal Gangs gaining power, she instructs Viggo to take their boy down South where they might survive, then walks out into the cold forest to freeze to death.  (Grim!)  Throughout, Viggo instructs his son that if he (the father) dies, and the boy is about to be caught, to immediately shoot himself in the head before getting caught, so as not to be captured (Grim!)  In one scene they stumble across a house that has naked people locked in the basement who are about to be taken to the smokehouse (Grim!)<br /><br />< Some spoilers below ><br />Despite this, the father's unyielding commitment to protect his son and get down South, and their human relationship, is still touching.  As is the scene when a straggler tries to steal all their stuff, they catch up to him, the father (at gunpoint) strips him of all his clothes and makes him walk away, but his son has compassion and gives the straggler back his clothes.  In the end, when the boy's father is about to die, it is very touching that he wants to \\"go with him\\" but the father says \\"you can't.\\"  Then the boy becomes a part of a good family (non-cannibals).  Final message: There's hope for the human race.<br /><br />It makes me sober to think that the horrible atrocities that are alluded in this movie are not necessarily fictional.  In World War 2 there were widespread atrocities commited against helpless civilians by the Nazis (well known), but equally brutally by the Japanese Army (less well known).  The Japanese treated Chinese and other civilians under their power as animals, and did a huge amount of killing, torture, rape, and even cannibalism.  In one chilling recounting by a former soldier (as documented in \\"Japanese Devils\\" by filmmaker Minoru Matsui), he raped a Chinese teenage girl (maybe 13-17), then casually beheaded her, cooked her flesh and fed it to his unit (!!)  So this movie could have been filmed in occupied China in WW2.  (WHEN is THAT movie ever going to happen?!)<br /><br />What do I take away from after watching this film?  Hope that an Apocalypse or War of Occupation never happens, keep some extra survival gear just in case (and lots of bullets!); don't underestimate the capacity for human evil; keep strong family relationships and treasure your family, keep hope in human good;  BE ONE OF THE \\"GOOD GUYS\\".
0385258623|5.0|This is about the fourth Bill Bryson book I've read and all have been among the funniest most enjoyable books I've ever read. This one had many laugh-out-loud moments and was great fun start to finish. One reason I read it is because my wife and I hope to do an extensive  trip around the U.S. when she retires in a couple years. I've traveled through much of our country before and it's fun to hear someone else's experiences written as Bryson does. I've had many great experiences in my travels and met people of every imaginable sort and this book just stokes my desire to get out there again. I sent a copy to my daughter who lives on the opposite coast because she loves to read and I hope it will whet her desire to see more of the country including back here in gold ol' New Jersey where her parents and many relatives are. One note of caution: Some people may be offended by comments about their home towns or states or the people from those areas but I think it's all in good fun and if you can take a little kidding, there will be no harm done. Highly recommended!
0385341679|1.0|I wake up every morning thinking about how horrible this book was. I almost thought she didn't write it. I think the story line just got too big for her and she couldn't tie it all together. There were so many holes in the story and things that were just plain ridiculous like the way Dani talked (illiterate) or the MacKeltar's families living at Chester's and their kids having the run of the place or Barron's (who we were led to believe did not eat in the previous 4 books) loved Mac's mom's apple pie and had a fully stocked fridge in his secret basement. I'm still not sure why she made Mac even more stupid in this book? If you had to walk through x amount of wards meant to keep everyone out and came upon something caged up why would you ever go hug it? She knew it was Barron's son so there had to be a pretty important reason he was caged. Plus the book was boring! I fell asleep after reading 30% and had to force myself to finish just to find out how it ended. The fact that she didn't tell us who Barron's was is what completely ruined it for me. I could go on but I agree completely with all of the other 1 star reviews so most of my feelings have been said already. I won't read anything more from this author.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This series has everything. Like urban fantasy? check, like thrillers? check, Like suspense? check, Like mystery? check, Like a little bit of history? check, Like faries? check. Have you been looking for a good series to read? Well, look no more! This sereis is absolutely amazing. I was so happy with this book. It answered a lot of questions that we have all been waiting to find out. I have to be honest, I never saw any of the twist coming at all. I love that this book (like all the previous books) is so unpredictable. The entire time Mac was trying to figure things out, I was right there with her pondering everything. There may have been a couple of loose ends, but I think she was saving that for the spin off. The major stuff we really wanted answered were answered. The beast at the cliff, the fourth prince in the church, who the unseelie king was, The queen, v'lane, barrons, Rowena, the book, motives etc...I was very satisfied with this book. I tried to read slow to make it last, but as always with the fever books I can't put them down! If you plan on reading this series, it would only make sense if you read them from book 1.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|Its a great album. I listen to it in the car everytime I drive. Its my CD of the moment. I love Miley and this is a departure from her previous work but it was not deserving of all the controversity. You would have thought she'd gotten naked in her video or used profanity. She has not. I have nieces and nephews from 10 to 16 who I would be proud for them to listen to this rather than the vulger junk they listen to.
B0034DGPEU|1.0|I wanted to like this book. I almost did- at first. But as many others have mentioned- my desire to like it was literally beaten down with the relentless onslaught of tragedy in this book. Every conceivable kind of tragic event takes place- incest, rape, murder, child abuse, pedophila, drug addiction. I mean really?!! On top of this I was really irritated by the lack of historical detail- theres nothing to moor the story in the time period it was set in.  I could go on and on- there was so much wrong with this book.     But the worst thing I can say is- it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I dont want to THINK about this HORRIBLE book anymore. Please dont waste your time and money
B00406UK7S|4.0|Overall, this is an entertaining movie set during the first half of second century ad, when Emperor Adrian ruled Rome. While that's all what you will get about history here, the script and pace are pretty good, with lots of battle scenes and blood all over the place. Similar to most American epics, the movie end of this British production is a little crappie. In addition, I missed more Gaelic traditional music on the soundtrack. Still, worth getting a copy. I would say that it is intriguing that Scot Picts are the bad guys here, but they also have been depicted as good guys by the time Roman ruling in Britain came to an end (mid to late Fifth century). Thus, I would recommend trying The Last Legion or King Arthur as well. Scenery and photography are pretty good in this movie. DVD comes with some ok extras, including Spanish subtitles.
1439177783|5.0|This book was incredible! I could not put it down. It tells of the struggles Portia de Rossi went through while suffering from severe anorexia and bulimia, all the while becoming a famous Hollywood actress. I highly recommend this book for teenage girls, and anybody who wants to learn more about Portia and/or how anorexia is such a deadly disorder. You will not be disappointed in this book; once you've read it you feel like you know Portia and you have deep empathy for people with anorexia. Happy Reading!! :)
B0012GMVQC|5.0|Surprisingly few reviews. Must have for guitar fans if only for the harmonic whammy bar etude \\"Where Were You\\". By this point, Beck had developed his current right hand technique; mainly thumb, wrist low re the top of the guitar, fingers hanging down, pushing on a floating bridge with the heel of his hand. The unusual tune is largely due to limiting note choices to natural, unfretted harmonics, which are then manipulated with the whammy bar. Steve Vai wrote (in the notes for his \\"Sound Theories\\"): \\"On \\"Sparks,\\" the violin melody at :32 (4 bars) is humbly inspired by Jeff Beck's performance of \\"Where Were You\\", in my opinion perhaps the single most touching electric guitar performance in history.\\" About half of the other cuts are pretty good post-fusion, which have become regular parts of his repertoire.
B0043GN6XU|5.0|For legendary tenor Plácido Domingo, this summit among Verdi's dramatic baritone roles has gone from a \\"maybe someday\\" dream to a daring experiment slated for the eve of retirement, to, finally, just another role for the (voluminous) books as his career chugs on in its sixth decade. In the same month Domingo celebrates his 70th birthday, two new DVDs document the undertaking, with Sony licensing the February 2010 Met broadcast and EMI the July 2010 Covent Garden. The dual releases are a testament to star power: neither production was new, and both have long been available on DVD with other singers (indeed, the first DVD of Giancarlo del Monaco's Met BOCCANEGRA has Domingo in the tenor role of Gabriele Adorno, c. 1995). If a viewer must choose, it should be an easy call: Covent Garden/EMI boasts a stronger overall cast and a staging with more life and dramatic perception.     On radio or records, this would only be a good BOCCANEGRA. Live in the house or on video, it is more -- new virtues become apparent, and vocal weaknesses are less bothersome as part of an overall theatrical package. Much credit goes to Elijah Moshinsky, whose Covent Garden production always was stimulating, and here benefits from two decades of refinement. Moshinsky left the work in its period and there are only light glosses of abstraction. A fixed set of columns at stage-right blurs distinctions between indoor and outdoor action, and Moshinsky and designer Michael Yeargan use a recurring visual motif of jumbled names and words significant to the action of the opera, printed on backdrops. In the Prologue, the writing is in Italian and has the look of chalk on a blackboard. In the Council Chamber, the same words are in Latin on a red and gold banner, an ornate display of establishment authority. In the beginning of the final act, with order restored, the words revert to Italian, taking the form of graffiti scrawls the people are trying to scrub away. (Do the words stand for, respectively, Paolo's ambitions, his influence while at Boccanegra's side, and ultimately his dishonor and death?)     Moshinsky and the singers deliver here what eluded Giancarlo del Monaco and his casts on both DVDs of the more lavish and realistic, \\"picture-book\\" Met production: persuasive and involving character work. There is evidence throughout of choices having been made, and for every one I feel misses the mark (Paolo and Pietro are too broad in their self-congratulatory back-slapping as they exit together in the Prologue), half a dozen are convincing, with the effect of drawing us into the characters' triumphs and dilemmas, papering over cracks in BOCCANEGRA's occasionally creaky plot. For example, Amelia/Maria absentmindedly touches and plays with the locket around her neck, which contains her dead mother's portrait, significantly in advance of the locket's becoming an explicit plot device -- such a good behavioral detail that it seems obvious in hindsight. Paolo is proto-Iagoian and dangerous from the first, which is not the worst way to put over a nebulous villain who somehow got both stronger and murkier with Boito's revisions. In the father/daughter reunion duet, Boccanegra does not simply express operatic amazement for a few seconds and then behave as though his long-lost daughter is a gift to be taken for granted. His awe and wonder pervade that entire movement, communicated by the way he looks at and gingerly touches Amelia's hands and hair, a sensitive physical evocation of parental curiosity. The treatment of Boccanegra's instructions to Paolo at the end of the Council Chamber Scene, culminating in the ordered curse, is intriguing: the Doge's attitude combines a predatory shrewdness and clarity with (at \\"Bramo l'ausilio tuo\\") caustic mockery.    Domingo has treated his voice well, and in his sixties I heard many performances that made me reflect that the singing would be the envy of a man 25 years younger. But it would be going too far to claim he has been untouchedby time. He sounds recognizable, but this is the kind of performance that prompts an admirer to begin with \\"For a man nearly 70 years old...\\" or \\"At an age when most tenors have long since retired...\\" The role's tessitura is no strain; indeed, in this Verdi baritone role, I sensed that the \\"Verdi\\" part was more of a hurdle than the \\"baritone.\\" Domingo's emission does not have the iron firmness of old (a slight wobble has set in); the breath line is shortened; and there are occasional resorts to vocal trickery to achieve legato at a desired dynamic level -- in the long lines of \\"Piango su voi\\" (Council Chamber) and the very exposed \\"Gran Dio, li benedici\\" (launching the final scene's vocal quartet), he now must affect a covered, hot-potato sound that makes consonants vanish. But an aging great voice can be preferred to an adequate one in its prime, and this is a Boccanegra of style, stature, and feeling. The experiment was a success.    The other principals are worthy collaborators, although, again, their total performances in collaboration with Moshinsky are more satisfying than their singing in isolation would be. Ferrucio Furlanetto makes an appropriate foil as Fiesco. Sixty at the time, he sounds plausibly older than Domingo, and now has a tendency to overact his way through when vocally hard-pressed (e.g. rushing through a line or abbreviating a note value in a shout or grunt). It is the right size and color of voice, and there are still power and intelligence behind it. \\"Il lacerato spirito\\" is affecting, not only the aria itself but the accompanying pantomimes of grief and devoutness.     Marina Poplavskaya (Amelia/Maria) reinforces impressions of her as a performer right for the video/HD age. Though she is musical and perceptive, her singing is frankly uneven; registers are not well integrated, and effects are unpredictable. At times she sounds impressively full; elsewhere, well-judged authentic pianissimi alternate with a breathy, unsupported croon masquerading as same, at which points she is barely audible. She is, as always, a sensitive and dignified actor, the best on this stage: consistently present and engaged in her emotional responses (including while listening) and generous in rapport with partners.     As Gabriele Adorno, Maltese tenor Joseph Calleja (here looking very much like the actor Oliver Platt) is sweet-toned and likable, but the role makes no sense for him at this juncture. He sounds to be having a strenuous sing, at the upper limit of his capacity, and the lack of ease (plus the presence of Domingo and Furlanetto) makes his clumsy Italian stand out more than it would if he were singing the Duke of Mantua, which he is presently doing in New York. Nor is this hotheaded young blade a good fit for Calleja temperamentally. It is difficult to imagine anyone finding this genial, cautious presence threatening; there is no tension when Adorno rages over his belief that Amelia has been unfaithful, and the off-stage bloodshed and intrigue in which the character takes part is hard to enact in one's mind. Calleja's acting mostly consists of eye-popping.     Jonathan Summers, an experienced Boccanegra himself, gives Moshinsky the desired Paolo -- unsubtly but effectively unhinged. Paolo is the one competitive advantage to the Met/Sony DVD, which had a sensational vocal performance by Stephen Gaertner, a young baritone who replaced the scheduled singer late.    Antonio Pappano has minor coordination issues between the orchestra and both Domingo and Summers in the Prologue, and a few lyrical effects early on sound fussed over, but his ends up being an impressive and memorable traversal. The reading is impactful yet alert to the richness of Verdi's somber chording, and full of striking individual contributions (the bass clarinet shadowing the curse; the unusually assertive timpani punching through Fiesco's gloomy philosophizing in the quartet).     Technical credits are top-notch, but for some inelegant compressionin the translations. Behind-the-scenes clips are woven into the performance, with Pappano explaining the plot and alerting listeners to musical details. These segments, seemingly pitched to opera novices, are discretely tracked; a viewer can watch or skip them to taste.     Despite my mixed feelings about much of the singing, I award this the highest rating on the strength of its stage production and other points of excellence mentioned above. It is the best BOCCANEGRA DVD for the time being, and there are now ten available (not bad for a supposed \\"problem\\" opera which faces audience resistance). For a baritone/bass duo in a vocal class by themselves, see Cappuccilli and Ghiaurov on an otherwise undistinguished 1976 Tokyo/VAI DVD, and hope for eventual release of the famous Abbado/Strehler production (the same duo plus Mirella Freni's Amelia/Maria). This is not to be confused with Abbado/TDK, with Karita Mattila and a poor male cast in an interesting minimalist production by Peter Stein. The 1995 Met/DG, the best of the three Met DVDs, is the suggested alternative to the new EMI for anyone demanding an actual baritone (Vladimir Chernov in this case) in the title role.

030746363X|2.0|Mr. Ferriss' strength is his marketing ability.  Every advertiser and marketing major should be made to study what Mr. Ferriss has done to tap into the American psyche.  His first book sold the \\"get rich quick\\" idea.  HIs second, this book, sells \\"the get skinny fast\\" idea.  What two book topics could be better suited to sell the American public?  We want more money and we want to be skinnier.  Mr. Ferris, clearly, wants to be as rich as he can with the least amount of effort.  Much of what is in this book has already been posted on his website, is in other books, and available for free in various forms.  But Mr. Ferriss has packaged this information together so beautifully it's almost hard not to buy into it...until you start thinking.  I applaud Mr. Ferriss' drive.  I applaud the way he has found to fund the life of his dreams.  But that's about all I can say in favor of the information he is selling.  And how cheap is it to call on your fans to give the book 5 stars on amazon?
B000CNESU8|5.0|A five star film, highly educational as well as prophetic. Review is for the film itself, not this particular DVD version.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|Storyplot:  This story tells the tale of 4 or 5 rich girls. Aria, Spencer, Emily, (Alison) and Hanna, the girls of Rosewood, Pensilvania. The five girls were perfect, until Alison went missing, and a mysterious person &#34;A&#34; sends the girls threataning messages, threataning to tell the world their secrets, secrets ONLY Alison knew. Who is &#34;A&#34; and what does he or she want?  My review:  The book was a real page-turner, facinating and breath-holding. Alison sort of ruined the girls lives, yet it is not over. With &#34;A&#34; threataning to completly ruin their lives I was scared for the girls. I really felt the characters. It goes to show that everybody has a secret to hide!

B002KS1IJC|4.0|A new twist on the old dragon hunter.  Good special effects, and the creature is worthy of other great sci-fi monsters (aliens, predators, etc.). I am not disappointed that I spent money to rent it.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|From the first few minutes of this fantastic film, I could not stop watching.  Not only because I am one of those people now obsessed with the Facebook network, but because it seemed too incredible for words that something this great could be created almost by accident.<br /><br />Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg and Justin Timberlake's Sean Parker were spot on.<br /><br />This film is described as the stunning tale of \\"a new breed of cultural insurgent:  a punk genius who sparked a revolution and changed the face of human interaction for a generation, and perhaps forever.\\"<br /><br />Unfolding in flashbacks and fast-forwards, this tale chronicles the creation of the Facebook phenomenon, while at the same time depicting the legal battles over ownership.<br /><br />At the end of the day, despite these difficulties and obstacles, the last ones standing (Zuckerberg, et. al.) are \\"accidental billionaires,\\" with Zuckerberg dubbed the youngest billionaire in the world.<br /><br />If I could give more than five stars for [[ASIN:B0034G4P7G The Social Network (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], I would.  But five stars it is.
B0000035E7|4.0|*Note* For those who make a helpful vote about this review, I'd appreciate it if you do vote it helpful even though you may not agree with it; don't act like an idiotic jerk and vote this review not helpful just because you don't agree with it.<br /><br />Hey, don't forget about Nirvana's first before getting into their most popular stuff. I liked their first album. I'm not gonna get much into history about this album, but I'll say that it did come out in 1989, and that this album doesn't come with the accomodating lyrics.<br /><br />I read a credible review about this album that caught my attention that mentioned how different websites have different lyrics of this album because the lyrics are subtle, and that was going to make me give this review 3 stars, but I bumped it up to 3.5 because of my hypothesis that listeners of \\"Bleach\\" hear similar things, so I assume there are mere nuances among the lyrics provided by websites, which is okay. The listeners' views just can't be totally different if they really exerted effort to hear the album's lyrics. For those of y'all who don't know by now, I am a lyrics person: the independent variables are the lyrics, and the dependent variables are the quality of an album. From what I've read and heard, the lyrics are at times repetitive, which could be annoying, but the guitar riffs provided make those not such a problem; the only problematic track is \\"Floyd the Barber,\\" which is about dying a bad but entertaining death. Other than that, some lyrics are unusual, a factor that should be praised.<br /><br />\\"About a Girl\\" was a radio hit. \\"Love Buzz\\" is the most entertaining sounding track off \\"Bleach.\\" Other rhythms are rugged and tough. I've noticed that people complained about the drummer parlayed on this album, but I don't see him being a problem.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely an album you can enjoy despite its intricate lyrics. You'll wind up banging your head along with the blazing rhythms.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|I bought \\"The Karate Kid\\" not because of the story but because of the acting of young Jaden.  The story was so much like the original movie which is not why I purchased the DVD.  I think young Jaden Smith did a terrific job of acting which makes it a must have movie for me.  He has a bright future ahead of him if he continues with acting.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|All of her colorful characters from her other books make a cameo.  The reader is taken on a roller coaster ride right along with Mac, and it is a good one.  Karen Moning ties up the series nicely with a big red bow for the readers, but still leaves you wanting more.  She just gets better with each book.
B002ZCY7PU|4.0|I haven't had a chance to keep up with this on TV so I was glad when I was able to get it on DVD.  I thought the pace of the story was very well done and the story line itself was very good.  Awaiting the 4th season to be released.
B004FEWYXS|5.0|I really like the album, and i play it over and over when i am driving. I am not saying its perfect, but its a collection of unfinished work, i believe Michael's voice is on every song, i am not saying he sings every part of every song, but because most of his songs are in layers it is difficult to tell about every part,sometimes you think its not him , then it is him so its hard. i find it hard to think they could find anyone who could replicate Michael's voice it was pretty unique. many of them were demos anyway i understand,but he is on every one.   what do you do when a great artist dies, chuck everything left in the bin, or give him the respect of producing it whilst acknowledging it is what it is?   I love it, i am able to accept its flaws and its unfinished nature and i accept it fo what it is.  it is great to hear Michael's other work and especially those he worked on in the last few years. it is still part of his legacy and him as a man.   I love it and i recommend it. just enjoy it. or try out individual tracks like Monster, Hold my hand and Keep your head up or Hollywood Tonight.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Great book!  Get it, read it, and love it!  Very much worth reading.  If you haven't read the others in the series, I would suggest you read them first to better understand everything.  The audible versions are even better, really bringing the characters to life with great accents and attitudes.
1423113497|5.0|If you don't like reading, can't stand fantasy, and could care less about Olympian gods... BUY THIS!!!    There's a reason this is a New York Times Bestseller. It's not hype. It's talent.   Rick Riordan has jammed this book with vivid characters, laugh your pants off humor, insane COMPLETELY unpredictable twists, scenes more real than a movie screen and tons-TONS-of action. You want something so compelling you'll stay up 'til five in the morning, gnawing your nails and desperately trying to keep your eyelids open? READ THIS.

B0034G4OXQ|1.0|The is the worst movie I have ever sean.  It had subtitles (UGH). it did not contain what was promised in the commercials.  DON\\"T wast your money on this film.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|What a great TV show.  The humor is tremendous, with a socially awkward genius Dr. Brennan (Ms. Deschanel), a strong and steady Agent Booth (Boreanaz), and a lovable assortment of associates; all trying to solve the most recent case involving a death and bones.  The acting is excellent and the quirky nature of the show adds tremendously (guitarist Billy Gibbons is Angela's father).    The undercurrent of a potential romantic relationship always stretches my patience.  After 5 years get on with it!  The best episode I remember was the one with Bones and Booth married, owning a disco.  The Thin Man movies showed a married couple could sustain comedy and mystery.    Anyway, these DVDs are totally worth owning.
B0009S3HI0|5.0|I grew up on Deftones. And I couldn't say a bad word about any record they put out, unless I stress the understanding that their music bleeds with the angst of my teen years, some times an undesirable effect. Even when I think of Deftones as my adolescent heros, assuming their qualities with that age, I understand they have never stopped evolving a sound and growing as any successful creature should. That being said, this album of soft renditions, haunting collaborations and beautiful covers, is my favorite.     The music categorizes more complex emotions than other records, displaying a wash of mature variety. The Skynard cover holds place as one of my favorite covers from any group, trumping the original to say the least. The cure and duran duran covers are tremendous and I would take these over the original any day. All I can say is I like when Deftones does it better! For all the covers, since my ears grew up on Deftones and not these other groups, they all make more sonic sense to me and are more enjoyable.   As for the other B-sides and rarities, they're great songs and renditions. From Savory to Be Quiet and Drive, each one is meaty and detalied- nothing flimsy as with some B-side albums. I've cycled through wax & wane, please please please, black moon and Be quiet & drive as top tracks over the years. I truly have no qualms with a single track on this album. The only way I can justify this as my favorite Def album is the fact that I listen to this one the most. Like I said it has gone beyond the adolescent feel I take from other albums, probably my curse and loss regarding full length releases. None the less I am more than happy with this concentration of excellent, emotionally gripping songs- spanning from the early days all the way through.
B003VB5D84|4.0|If you like guitars and blues, you'll like this DVD.  After looking at the internet I note that not all the music was included.  For instance, Jeff Beck wasn't nearly as featured as he should have been.  Also, the trio with John Mayer was awesome.  Also Earl Klugh and John Bonamassa were great, as was Sonny Landreth w/Eric Clapton.  I must say Hubert Sumlin didn't belong on this DVD.  Same with Ronnie Wood (he's getting to look as bad as Keith Richards).  Thank the good Lord Johnnie Winters wasn't on the DVD.    Clapton's session had some very uninspired music included, but he's really good when he's playing with someone else.  Concerts are also great to watch and I'd buy this DVD if I didn't already own it.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|good cd with a few memorable songs.  you could probably go to itunes and preview to purchase the best tracks without having to own the entire thing.  unless you are a diehard hudson fan, thats what i would recommend!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was so intriguing I couldn't put it down. The viewpoint of a young child, i thought might at first be hard to read but I fell into his innocence of the story and it kept me riveted the whole way through.
B002RKXO5O|4.0|fantasic and fun performances of take that live.  this is minus robbie williams but the vocals are strong and the sets are over the top.  it has a few moments of corney, but overall it is watchable.  i am not big on circus themed anything, but there is enough distraction and good harmonies that you can easily get distracted!
B003DZBYL8|5.0|Although it's completely different from any other PoS' album, RS1 is amazing. It's not about (prog) metal or anything, it's about good music. During a thorough listening of this album, the listener can spot all the details and concerns in the recording process and, obviously, enjoy the great music in it. The artwork of the vinyl package is BEAUTIFUL, a true work of art. Besides the lyrics, there are comments of Daniel on the recording and creative processes of each track, which I enjoyed and consider vital to any PoS fan. Cheers from Brazil!

B003EY7IRC|5.0|**I have tried not to include any spoilers, but those unfamiliar with the previous Fever books who don't want ANY clues should proceed with caution**  I have thoroughly enjoyed the entire Fever series.  By turns funny, sexy, thrilling and heart-breaking, this series gripped me from the very beginning.  Watching Mac grow from a sheltered, spoiled princess, to a powerful, dangerous, fully-realized woman, honed and tempered by countless challenges and incredible losses, has been a pleasure.  The story has thundered along at a break-neck pace for four books, and number five is no exception.  Moning packs twists, turns and stunning revelations into a finale that keeps your adrenaline pumping and your mind racing from word one to the final page.  If you enjoy a heady mix of steamy romance, Fae magic, Druids, ancient weapons, gender-bending trans-dimensional reincarnation and a sentient, power-mad, just-plain-mad Book, well...this just might be the series for you.  Moning hits one out of the park with this wild conclusions to the Fever series.
0743297334|5.0|\\"Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn...\\"<br />With these words - which immediately give us a narrator with attitude - Ernest Hemingway begins his first big novel, published in 1926.  This novel perfectly evokes the twenties. It is a portrait of a group of British and American expatriates enjoying the caf&eacute; scene of Left Bank Paris, who decide to take an excursion to Pamplona in Spain to see bullfighting.<br />What could be more charming or interesting than to see (or hear in Hemingway's inimitable dialogues) these well-educated bright young things? And yet the ravages of the Great War lurk underneath the surface, with ruined bodies, ruined minds, cynicism and spiritual dissolution.<br />It is helpful to remember that when people talk about the \\"Lost Generation\\", they mean the survivors of a horrible and wasteful war. This war killed so many young men (the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916 cost England 23,000 young men), that plenty of women had to live out their lives without any hope of marriage and family.<br />It is not surprising that the twenties - when people tried to cope with the aftermath of so much destruction - evokes so many images of light and darkness.  This book is particularly relevant today.
B000FC1KGG|4.0|It's been years since I read Skellig, but the story still stays with me. A desperate young boy, with a brand new baby sister in the hostpital and a dying man in his shed. The boy seems to have enough issues of his own, but as luck would have it, he gains a friend too, a young girl homeschooled by her mother. The pair slowly dishes out chinese food and prayers to the dying man, a man with wings and seemingly no will to go on. It's a lovely and haunting story, about beleiving and miracles, and the innocence of hope. With the same feeling  as Farenheit 451 and the children's book The Giving Tree, it's a story you simply can't pick up and forget. It's a story that pulls you through on rainy days, when all things seem dark. I recomend this to any adult with a nostalgic mood, or a child with an imagination that needs something stronger or more wonderous than what's on the library shelves. Enjoy
B0043EV774|5.0|We recently purchased a 3D TV and have started buying movies for it. This is the best I have found so far with great 3D effects and a good story line and good acting.
B002ZG997C|4.0|The movie dragged a little in the begining and kind of left me wondering if it was going to be another end-of-the-world picture that we have already seen a dozen or more times.....but wait until the end.....
B001FB4W0W|4.0|It has to be said that HBO and Alan Ball create some great TV programs and after the stupendous `Six Feet Under' I couldn't wait to get my hands on this series. The style and direction was reminiscent of SFU at times, but generally this has a feel all of it's own. This follows life in Bon Temp, a Louisiana town, after vampires have come out of the closet and live openly amongst humans. The main character is Sookie Stackhouse who is telepathic, falls in love with a Vampire and starts to realise some of the dangers and complications this may bring. There is also another storyline where people are being killed in town and of course the vampires are the main suspects. The other characters are great to watch, whether it be Tara who is hard and cynical, Bill the charismatic vampire love interest, Sam the local bar owner who secretly loves Sookie, Lafayette who is the local drug dealer, short order cook and deliverer of some hilarious one liners or Jason who is Sookies brother and a bumbling ladies man. They are all great characters and there are also a whole host of other town folk who compliment the main cast. Some people criticise this series for it's sexual nature and no doubt this has plenty of nudity and sexual scenes, but this is mainly in the first half, relevant to the story and people seem to forget that the erotic nature of vampires has been a theme of the myth for years. This is a good series and highly watchable and you are soon immersed in the world created for you and as the series progresses plenty of surprises and twists are thrown up. There is a brief mock-u-mentary on the extras, as well as the obligatory commentaries but to be honest the extras are a little sparse overall. If you a fan of Alan ball then you won't be disappointed and if you enjoy well written, constructed, acted and directed TV series' then this is well worth considering.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000GGOCIE|5.0|I read this book at the first publishing and loved it. I was glad to see it had been republished. I bought it and the other companion books with it. Fast delivery. No problems. Anxious to read all her books! Good pricing. Paper quality not as good as original, but price of book was very fair.
B001NFNFNA|4.0|'Changeling' is yet another masterful offering from Clint Eastwood and I have to say his directing of this true story really is exceptional. This film follows the case of Christine Collins, who's son went missing in the 1920's and then what happened when the police force returned a boy five months later who they claim is her son but who in reality isn't. Christine then tries to fight the corrupt police department as they refuse to admit their mistake and even claim she is mentally ill to try to make her go away. This takes up the majority of the first half of the film and the second half deals with a whole other aspect of the story that I won't divulge here to prevent spoilers. Needless to say the second half is just as overwrought and emotional as the first half and by the end you will truly feel wrung out and affected. It was a revelation to see Jolie act so well and if you were a doubter of her abilities in the past then this film may show just what she is capable of. This is quite a bleak film but has very powerful performances and has all the more impact by the fact that it is based on true events. I have quickly become a fan of Eastwoods directing and if you have enjoyed other films of his in the past then I'd say it is a good bet you will enjoy this. He seems to know how to choose scripts with depth and gravitas and manages to portray that on film especially well. This may not be deemed positive or happy viewing, but a film doesn't always need to be to have an effect or impact and this film offers both of these in spades. This is a moving film with heartfelt performances, a shocking story and masterful direction and I'd suggest you check it out at some point soon.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0041T52S6|5.0|One of the funniest movies I have seen in a while. I can watch it over and over and still laugh.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|To call `Cool Hand Luke' a classic is a vast understatement. I saw this a few days ago on TV and was hooked within the first fifteen minutes and as I was unable to finish watching it I bought it straight away and I know already that this will be one film I will watch again and again. This has an amazing performance from Paul Newman as Luke, a loner who refuses to bow to the might of authority, whether it be in society or in the prison he is sent to. He manages to inspire his fellow inmates with his humour and quiet dignity in the face of the warders cruelty and you can't help but connect with his character. This has many memorable scenes and the egg eating scene is wonderfully funny and yet others scenes are especially poignant and emotional. The direction is pretty good, if a little dated and stylised, but this only adds to the character and classic nature of the film on offer. The supporting cast are very good in this film and the entire ensemble elevate this film from being merely good to being great. This also has an excellent 'making of' documentary included on the extras. Having heard a lot about this film over the years and never having seen it I am delighted I finally have and I can honestly see what all the fuss is about. This has style, a great story, many famous lines and scenes and a wonderful anti establishment feel that makes you feel mildly rebellious just by watching it. Highly recommended indeed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B001CZJKS0|4.0|If  you're a Halloween fan, chances are you have everything included in this box set already, but here's a quick run down of what you're getting in the box:<br /><br />Disc 1 is the 2007 Blu-Ray release<br />Disc 2 is the 1999 THX Edition, or:  Disc 1 of the 1999 Limited Edition two-disc set.  The same version of the film was then released separately from the limited two-disc set, once with a holographic cover and once without.  In 2007, the same version (THX-mastered) was re-issued, once in a O-Card 3D<br />Foil Embossed slipcover and once with the classic artwork.<br />Disc 3 is the Extended Edition, or:  Disc 2 of the 1999 Limited Edition two-disc set, which was also re-released separately in 2001 as The Extended Edition, but with a different cover.<br />Disc 4 is Disc 1 of the 2006 two-disc release, 25 Years of Terror.  You ONLY get Disc 1, the documentary portion of that release.  If you want the bonus materials on Disc 2, you'll have to buy it separately.<br />Discs 5 and 6 are the Divimax Editions of Halloween 4 and 5, which were released separately in 2006.<br /><br />As for the packaging, the outer box itself is sturdy and comes with a plastic slipcover shield to minimize wear and tear.  Other than being nice to look at, it serves as a housing for the keepcase that holds each disc  on its own plastic insert.<br /><br />You'll probably want to do yourself a favor and remove the keepcase with all the discs and keep it separate from the box so that you don't have to continually remove the shield and open it, which would lead to wear and tear over time.<br /><br />It's well worth the money, especially if you're a new fan who doesn't want to go hunting for the previous releases -- even if you can still find them new and used on eBay, Amazon Marketplace or other outlets.
B00066FBQG|5.0|`Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is a western that's not a western. In fact it is more of a buddy movie set in the west and later Bolivia. This follows the two main characters of the film title as they rob various trains, banks and payroll caravans throughout America and Bolivia and how they flee a gang of lawmen who are hunting them down. The interplay between Newman and Redford is completely absorbing and the humour they bring to their roles is subtle and infectious. The story is pretty basic but carried out with real aplomb and even though not being a huge fan of westerns, I found myself completely captivated by this film. The scene where they are trying to rob a Bolivian bank with limited knowledge of Spanish is hilarious and the part where they are initially being tracked by the lawmen is full of suspense and is full of tension the whole time. The direction in this film is great and the acting is superb from all involved and the chemistry between Newman and Redford is obvious throughout. If you are yet to see this classic film then it is well worth buying at some point. It is extremely well made and required viewing for fans of cinema and should be in any discerning film collection.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B001QBC4AG|3.0|I'm grading the re-issue, not the original album.  The original is a great, diverse concept album.  You can read about that elsewhere.  What I'm complaining about is that this reissue, which is twice as long as the 1995 version excludes \\"Glow Girl\\" and \\"Melencholia\\", two excellent Who songs that were outtakes.  Maybe it was a licensing issue.  Otherwise I don't understand why this version does not include these two songs.  There is no mention of it in the liner notes either.  You would simply have to hear both versions.
B000002LJW|4.0|`Journeyman' is one of the albums that started my love affair with all things Clapton and it still has a special place in my heart. It has a great mix of rock and blues on it and shows Clapton when he is playing on all cylinders. The album opener `Pretending' still manages to raise a smile on my face even though I played this album to death on cassette and later on CD and `Bad Love' still sounds as powerful now as when I first heard it. Apparently when Clapton played the original mix of this album to record execs they said it was good but could he go off and write another `Layla', Clapton went away and `Bad Love' was his answer. And what a powerful answer it is, with a strong riff and great lyrics. There is also a duet with Robert Cray called `Old Love' and in my opinion this is one of the best blues tracks Clapton has ever written and I still get goosebumps when the chorus plays. This is the album where Clapton moved away from his synth heavy eighties sound and back towards the blues he is revered for and this album is the perfect blend of the two styles and if you are a fan of either styles of music you will be well catered for here. There isn't a bad track on this album and I can still happily listen to this from start to finish despite having heard it hundreds of times and if you enjoy this then I can only recommend `Unplugged' which was the natural progression from this album and features many of the songs here in an acoustic format. This is required listening and essential for your Clapton collection.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000002LA2|4.0|`August' is one of those albums that gets better with repeated listening and I have to say it is one of my favourites from Clapton's back catalogue. It is quite dated now, with heavy eighties production, but with Phil Collins at the production helm and the era it was written in, this is to be expected. This has some awesome tracks on it and the album opener `It's In The Way That You Use It' is best known from the film `The Colour of Money' but is a credible track in it's own right. This album also features a duet with Tina Turner on `Tearing Us Apart' which has great feel to it and the last three tracks stand out for me and end this album on a high. `Holy Mother' has a highly emotive solo and shows what one man can do with one note if he has emotion and skill in his playing, `Behind the Mask' has become a eighties classic now and I love the overall feel and drive of this track and `Grand Illusion' has a brooding feel that ends this album perfectly. This album is overlooked by Clapton fans and there are plenty of amazing albums of his to choose from, but this has a special place in my heart and offers up some great music. Although it is very much `of it's time' it also shows everything good about the eighties with solid song writing and musicianship. Well worth adding to your Clapton collection at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B0013ND30W|4.0|`Sleeping Beauty' is a classic Disney animation from before the time of CG and computer trickery and it has to be said it is even more beautiful in it's restored state. Following the fairy tale of sleeping beauty who is cursed by a witch to sleep until woken by her one true love this film has a great story for kids, some musical numbers and is interesting enough for adults to enjoy as well. The witch, Maleficent, is quite sinister at times and the parts of the film which feature her are quite dark and small children may get scared, but not excessively so. It is funny to watch this film after it was so brilliantly parodied by 'Shrek', but that doesn't detract from the charm of this film in the slightest, in fact it seems all the better for it. The extras are what we have come to expect from Disney re-releases, a making of feature, music video of the theme song, deleted scenes and various games for younger viewers. I always feel the extras have more to offer kids than adults but I guess this is essentially a children's film despite the obvious enjoyment adults will get from it as well. This is a classic Disney film and whilst it lacks the excitement or artistic skill of films such as 'Pinocchio', this should still be added to your Disney collection at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0000248L0|5.0|Excellent album  now remastered, to my opinion one of the heavy metal's top ten albums, because of the music, arrangements and lyrics, if you like Testament's great \\"Practice What You Preach\\" and if you haven't heard Never Neverland yet, just take a time and enjoy it!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|\\"Take, if you must, this little bag of dreams, Unloose the cord, and they will wrap you round.\\" William Butler Yates<br /><br />\\"Ha, bloody ha!\\" Viewing this movie left me with wobbly legs, barely able to walk the first few steps towards the door. My hands were shaking and my head ached. What a rush! I haven't had this reaction since \\"Black Hawk Down\\". Christopher Nolan has artfully taken the images of our subconscious nocturnal ruminations and used them as priceless fodder for his \\"Inception.\\" Not only was I completely drawn in within the first few minutes, I felt involved.<br /><br />The notion of dreaming 'in conference\\", as well as in layers is interesting and intelligent, but there are myriads of such ideas bouncing around in the heads of creative sorts all over the place. The fact the Nolan was able to gather the group of actors that he did and then pull it off is extremely impressive.<br /><br />DiCaprio as Cobb the retired 'architect' was, as usual, solid and dependable. Even more, his haunted affect in respect to his relationship with his wife, was chilling. Ellen Page, Ariadne, becomes to Cobb a sort of 'good angel' on one shoulder to his wife's (Marion Cotillard) bad angel on the other. The insinuations of ambiguity between reality and dream become a frightening proposition for Cobb, and for those of us who witness. As supporting cast, Tom Hardy, Ken Watenabe and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were icing on the cake, powerful and proficient in their parts. What a surprise to see Gordon-Levitt used as muscle! Cillian Murphy's muted performance as the passive victim was underplayed in the very best of ways.  He is certainly one brilliantly versatile actor (see 'Peacock').<br /><br />CGI was mind-bendingly claustrophobic in some scenes and eye candy for the ADHD advantaged in others! I'm far too ignorant about such things to comment beyond that.<br /><br />There have been some criticisms regarding character development and confusion regarding the role of Kobel Engineering in the dream sequences. As far as character development in concerned, when chaos abounds, there is not much time to exchange personal information or go fishing, however much you wish. This was an intense experience that I believe would have suffered from too much exposition. As to Kobel Engineering, it is important to keep track of what is in Cobb's surreality and and what isn't.<br /><br />\\"Inception\\" was the movie of 2010 for me. Furthermore, I plan to watch it at least a couple of more times in order to cull the marvelous minutia right out of it.character development in concerned, when chaos abounds, there is not much time to exchange personal information or go fishing, however much you wish.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|An excellent movie for kids of all ages.  My 4 year old Granddaughter is wearing it out. She's watched it at least 100 times and giggles everytime.  The movie is enjoyed by boys, I'm sure, but because the children in the movie are girls, I think it probably appeals to them more.  The movie was a big surprise for me, I never expected to enjoy it so much based on the movie previews.  Don't let them deter you, the movie is heartwarming for everyone!!
B0042K4ZZK|4.0|'Nikita' is a fast moving, action packed series that garners glimpses of the back-stories and personalities of pertinent characters. This PG-13 conspiracy thriller surprises, mysteriously holds back, and smoothly slips snippets of dry humor into unexpected moments. Nikita operates from a damaged but determined and focused point of view. This is a strong woman who does not depend on her sexuality, but who is also not averse to pulling it out of her bag of tricks as a means to an end. She will bring these bastions down! She once was one of them, and retains slightly mixed affections towards certain individuals, but that will not stop her quest. Those affections go both ways. Will Michael(her ex-handler), or will he not, turn and aid her in her objective? On the other hand, might one of them kill the other? Alex, embedded within the enemy's lair, is Nikita's loyal cohort, collaborating in the ultimate conspiracy to tear down this gargantuan abuse of government power. Xander Berkeley embodies soul-less evil as Percy, the Director. Furthermore, the lovely psychiatrist, employed by Percy, is also the interrogator/ torturer. Hmmm...? The story is just complicated enough to keep it very interesting. This is a new Nikita, not a remake. Watch and enjoy!

B002WTOXUK|5.0|\\"District 9\\" is the 'Proud Mary' of Science Fiction. It starts out at a measuredly pace, giving us a sensatory visual of the man who unwittingly hijacks us into his worst nightmare. Wikus begins as a nerdy, inept guy chosen by a large corporation to evict aliens from their razor-wired stockade to relocate them to a situation out of sight and out of mind. He is determined to get the job done and indifferent to the predicaments this will heap upon them. It appears that the government of Johannesburg, Africa initially takes at least a small amount pity on the plight of the aliens, but then simply ignores them for as long as possible.<br /><br />And, this is where we go from cool and calibrated to a steady surge in story and action. Copley basically does a one-man show and he does it brilliantly. He goes from being a geeky civilian, simply a part of 'the system' who is safe and secure existing within life's routine who then, through a gamut of mind-blowing, out-of-this-world, life and body altering events, suffers a forced conversion of mind, body and soul of which he must decide a direction.<br /><br />The manner in which this film seems to, more accurately than most, reflect the human reaction to situations of so-called 'good vs. evil' is impressive. Wikus, like most of us, operates comfortably within the policies and procedures and rules and regulations of job and society, moving myopically within the herd, until he is virtually compelled to do otherwise. In fact, at that point, I felt abandoned right alongside him. Still, it takes in-the-face trauma and violence for Wikus to perceive both his world and that of the aliens in a more representative light. Ironically, he still maintains his agenda, attempting to recoup his own losses, until, well... Anyway, are we not most like him?<br /><br />Finally, the alien child is a character study in itself. The child is the only creature in the entire movie who thinks as an individual, deciding whom to like and whom to distrust, and so this scripture, created by a human, comes to mind, \\"But Jesus said to them: Suffer the little children, and forbid them not to come to me: for the kingdom of heaven is for such.\\"  Children!  Whether they be wolves or people, those little ones are such sponges, innocent and ready to be influenced by those around them.<br /><br />Well, I hope I am still around in 2012 to experience the sequel.  Hope it's not about the end of earth, humans looking for somewhere else to live..., and so this scripture, created by a human, comes to mind, \\"But Jesus said to them: Suffer the little children, and forbid them not to come to me: for the kingdom of heaven is for such.\\"  Children!

B00478CFAE|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. This brother and sister duo flow so well together, and the music is so different for a singer/song writer. Very haunting and moving stuff here. I love this album and if you like singer/song writer's you will love this album too!
B003VDZWAQ|5.0|The first thing 'Haven' has going for it is the beautiful, seaside Nova Scotian landscape which is masterfully captured for this series. As a result, I feel compelled to take a vacation to a place I have never even considered! Secondly, an eclectic cast of actors make up the core of this new SYFY series. Nicholas Campbell, (formerly of 'Da Vinci's Inquest') whose persona seems to slip from the pages of an Erle Stanley Gardner novel, and Lucas Bryant, who does not feel physical pain, represent the law as a father and son duo. Just their last name, Wuornos, colors this picture eerie. Emily Rose, who I really enjoyed in 'Jericho' (a show that ended before its time), performs the role of a temporarily displaced FBI agent who just might get some answers about her own unknown past from this strange little town, should she stay. In the meantime we are torn between the two men in her life, and getting some frights, as well as kicks and giggles out of various characters.<br /><br />Yes, 'Haven' is comprised of many unique and interesting citizens with certain interesting abilities which generate potential for a number of intriguing episodes. Between the mysterious tale of a small town with an otherworldly aura and the possibility that Agent Audrey Parker has discovered nuggets of her own obscure history, 'Haven' is the premise for some sort of a 'Twilight Zone' hued hit for the muggy months of summer and each episode just gets hotter!
B002YMWPUA|5.0|This was a very sad and difficult movie to watch.  The acting was great and the actor who played Bobby Sands couldn't have done any better.  There are long periods in the movie where there is no dialogue at all.  There is one very long scene where Sands has a discussion with a priest before he goes on the hunger strike.  It is worth watching the movie to hear this conversation alone.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves dramatic movies and are interested in human rights and /or Irish history.
1400052173|5.0|This book kept popping up in my audiobooks list, and the topic sounded really dull to me (I am not a scientist nor that interested in science).  But after I read some rave reviews I decided to download it.  Boy was I glad that I did!  This was a riveting story!  Especially for the non-scientists like myself, I had never heard of HeLa or Henrietta Lacks.  Yet, HeLa had a huge impact on my life (from vaccines to cancer).  I learned a great deal about cells and cancer in a very interesting and non-preachy book.  I love how the author took us on her journey and that not every question is answered but many are by the end of the book.      I listened to the book on a long car ride and at the end of the ride I sat in my car listening to the last 45 minutes because I was so enthralled with the story.  If you are a non-scientist like myself you will LOVE the history and weaving storyline.  The audio version is riveting!!!

0786956291|4.0|Essentially, this is the 4th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons with most of the options stripped away to create a more streamlined and \\"quicker-to-play\\" version of the classic table top role playing game.<br /><br />Don't be confused though - this is not another version of the game... it is 100% compatible with D&D 4e.  This set, however, works as a much easier way to get introduced to D&D and RPGs in general.<br /><br />The box contains everything you need to sit down and play.  You still need someone to run the game (the Dungeon Master), so that person will need to read a bit deeper into the rules.  Otherwise, characters can be created quickly using the effective character creation section.  Monster tokens are provided as are maps and an adventure.<br /><br />If you are new to D&D, this set is a great (and economical) way to get started.  If you are a D&D vet, the only value this will have is from a collectors stand point.  The counters and maps are useful, but particularly noteworthy for someone that has the core rules already.

B000F7CMQ8|5.0|Clark Gable is an animal trapper in Africa to bring back alive the various animal catches for the zoos. Ava Gardner comes upon him and his crew thru a boating accident and of course, she is smitten by the handsome Gable. But, it does not stop there as Grace Kelly, an anthropologist, and her husband, come to Gable's camp asking him to take them into the land of the giant Apes on a safari. Gable is smitten by Kelly and agrees to take them to the land of the giant Apes, and Ava Gardner shows her jealosy of his intention for Grace Kelly as she goes along on this adventure.       There is great cinema shots of the African safari lands and has plenty of action with the various wild animals in it. The movie is an adventure, entertaining movie even if the love triangle was not part of it.        Clark Gable is intent on luring Grace Kelly away from her husband and has a love encounter with her. The drama intensifies as they get to the land of the Giant Apes when Gable plans to make his move to take her away from her husband by telling him that he and Grace Kelly are in love.        There is great tension and action when Gable's party encounters the apes.      The twist comes at the end as the love triange plays out in a very unique way. A very entertaining movie that has been time tested. And one cannot go wrong with stars of this magnitude including the one and only Clark Gable, as handsome as ever, though older, and two beautiful costars such as Grace Kelly, and Ava Gardner.
1594202842|1.0|I breezed through this book in one day; there is really nothing here of any value from the perspective of a parent (which I am), of a teacher (which I am, too), or of an American interested in the interplay of American culture and other, non-American, cultures (which I am as well). Most of the negative reviews of this book get it right: way too much stereotyping and horrific scenes of tragic family life, bordering on emotional abuse. The author will appear soon in a local bookstore here, but I'll skip it.   Much of the problem with this book is that the author is not Chinese at all; she grew up in the United States, and is as American as my Grandmother, born of German parents and raised in Kentucky. It is almost as if she yearns to recreate what she imagines a Chinese mother would be. Therein lies a psychologically revealing truth for the whole book. If I were Chinese, I would be offended by her approach; being American, I am offended by her approach. The book is rather simple-minded; especially for an author who should know better. Hard work is hard work; abuse is abuse. I am not sure that ethnicity factors into it; in fact, replace her claims of \\"Chinese mother\\" with \\"African mother\\" or \\"Hispanic mother\\" and the level of the insult becomes clear. I wondered throughout the book how Chua would have treated her children had they been autistic or dislexic or, God forbid, retarded. She was lucky; other parents don't have the good fortune of healthy children, Yale careers or New Haven neighborhoods. Her weak conclusion to the book comes almost as an afterthought; it is a tired platitude, as frustrating after 229 pages, as it is dull-witted.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Don't talk about \\"Fight Club\\" watch it first otherwise the film will be lose it's meaning and clever sense of surprise. Edward Norton plays a brand obsessed insomaniac who feels overwhelmed by society in David Fincher's \\"Fight Club\\" adapted from the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. Norton meets a soap salesman (Brad Pitt) on a bad plane ride home after who takes him in when Norton loses his home. This begins an odyssey for both where they found a fight club allowing men to reestablish their masculity that ultimately morphs into a militia type movement swallowing both.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by tne opening menu--Fincher has cleverly use the DVD menu for \\"Never Been Kissed\\" which makes it appear as if the Blu-ray might be the wrong one--it represents the themes of the film quite well about the deceptive surfaces that we perceive all around us.<br /><br />\\"Fight Club\\" like a lot of Fincher's movies is an acquired taste but for those willing to join in and watch this combination of drama, action and satire, it's a worthwhile but bloody journey. Although not often discussed Fincher along with Chris Nolan is one of the few filmmakers who routinely challenges our assumptions about storytelling in films tackling a number of difficult stories, themes and manages to combine the artiness of someone like David Lynch into structured storytelling.<br /><br />The Blu-ray for \\"Fight Club\\" looks marvelous with a sharp, detailed presentation dominated by the yellow/brown color scheme and lighting of neon that has dominated his films since \\"Se7en\\".

0439023521|5.0|OK- so I'm nearly 50 but I picked up this book from my 14 year old daughter's pile and could not put it down.  It's a great futuristic book with teens as the main characters- sort of a modern day coming of age book.  Characters are strong and unforgetable.  I read this book nearly 6 months ago and they are in my head like I read it yesterday.  I also read the other 2 books of the trilogy and they were NOT dissappointing either!  Loved them all and they are fast reading.  For once I did not look at the last few pages of the book and it was worth the wait.  If you like this, you will also like Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow (sequel)- another coming of age futuristic book.  Enjoy!
B003F1WM2K|3.0|I don't want to knock down this book, it is definitely a worthwhile read, but I did have some questions that surfaced as I read it.  The cover photo is a good place to start...what era was she living in?  I was born a couple of months before her, lived through the whole scene, also in NYC where most of her story is about.  Regarding the photo, the headband, the clothes...like they were going to a costume party.  Especially Mapplethorpe, his hat, clothes....what a joke.  I bought out of the thrift shop too, lived on the lower east side, but I don't remember me or anyone I ever knew looking like that, like a couple of clowns.    I originally bought it since I thought it would be a flashback of my time in NYC, but for the most part, it was like reading a book from someone that lived there during another era, like maybe the Beat era.  Maybe it was the Warhol worshipers, I didn't run with that crowd, a whole different group of people...homosexuals and vampire types.  She wrote often about Kerouac, Ginsberg and Burroughs, the '50s crowd, who were also either bisexual, or homosexual.  I didn't get the feeling that they mixed with the people I knew, the freaks of the '60s.    But I did enjoy her story, she's seen and lived a lot, lost a lot of her friends, and most likely is carrying a lot of pain inside of her.  She deserved her success, it was a long, hard road, but she persevered.  She was also very lucky too, to have avoided the HIV that killed Mapplethorpe.  Her destiny was to survive, and she did.

His descriptive abilities are second to none and his characters are usually just as rich and vibrant.<br /><br />The fourth book, \\"A Feast for Crows\\" was the inevitable clunker that seems to plague nearly every series.<br /><br />As I read \\"A Dance with Dragons\\", I caught glimpses of the first three books in the series but in the end, it turned out to be more like the mid-series clunker.  Only it was worse.<br /><br />If you like descriptive prose that is sometimes beautiful, this book is worth four stars.  Martin goes way overboard on the descriptions, but that is a fantasy author's right to a great degree.<br /><br />On the story side, the book is worth one star.  It never came close to actually recapturing the brilliance of the first three books in the series, it just gave hints at that lost brilliance.  I would have given the book 2.5 stars if it were possible on Amazon, but since it is not and since I value story over technical writing ability, I went with the lower \\"whole star\\".<br /><br />The plot flies apart in Dance.  New characters are introduced out of nowhere and old friends are relegated to the woodpile...maybe to be revived later (who knows nowdays lol).  There is no resolution to be found, only more questions and more frustrations.<br /><br />A good book, even in a series, usually has a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Dance felt like almost pure middle with tiny portions of beginning and end mixed in.  Those portions were too small for a book of this length at this point in a series.<br /><br />As far as the series goes, I am among Martin's oldest fans since I have purchased every book within a month of release.  I don't like the pace at which he writes and, to be fair, I don't understand some of his public relations efforts.  However, I have always loved his writing.  I was willing to forgive the clunker that was \\"A Feast for Crows\\" but my hopes were dashed in \\"A Dance with Dragons\\".<br /><br />I want the old Martin with that rare mix of beautiful prose and adept story telling.
B003UESJH4|5.0|It's so satisfying to see a film that has real, heartfelt, life-affirming qualities done so well!  I was hesitant to see it, due to the horrific review by the very cynical Manohla Dargis in the New York Times.  I should have known better!  I also wondered how interesting a film could be just about someone curing a stutter.    If you have any of these doubts, please be assured that this film is so fine that you will be richly rewarded by seeing it.      I won't retell the plot as so many others have done.  I'll just join the applause for the terrific cast.  Colin Firth manages to play \\"royal\\" and \\"vulnerable\\" at the same time, and so well.  He really humanizes the king, lets us in so that we care about him very much.  Geoffrey Rush is every bit his equal as his total opposite, the flamboyant commoner from Australia, with no credentials who succeeds where everyone else has failed.  Helena Bonham Carter was perfect as the very charming, smart and loyal wife.  How nice to see Claire Bloom, for a few moments, as the King's mother.      This could have been a terrible film, but fortunately for us, it is so well done that I predict it will be popular for a long time.  Besides being an entertaining film, it is a true story that happened during the lifetime of many readers here.  I heard the story of The Prince of Wales' abdication many times, but never knew anything about the less glamorous but deeply honorable George.  How nice to see this here.
B004CUVRF6|5.0|I loved this movie and now must own it on DVD! As a kid, I read the books (all 15) and I must say that this movie did not quite follow the story of the books, but did deliver on the moral of the entire series. A few things were changed to make the movie work better and have more of a background to build upon, which is understandable for me. The animation was amazing, the score was amazing and the personalities of the owls were spot on! I loved this movie from start to finish and will reconmmend anyone to watch it!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It's a good book but because it is written from the prospective of a 5 yr old boy it is hard to figure out what he is talking about at times. I read this book in 4 days so it was good.  The story line is very sad and makes you want to grab the little guy and make his world good..
B0021L8V0W|4.0|Fast pace action thriller was entertaining and the plot was solid. I watched the extended blu ray version. Fans of revenge flicks will like it. Some people seem disappointed that it's not more realistic. It's fiction. You want reality, watch documentaries. This was more realistic than most of the Bond movies.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is a epic tale on a grand scale filled with complex characters addressing such themes as morality, honor...and love of course.  This story draws you in with the dilemnas and issues the characters are addressing.  The author fills the world with tremendous detail in its environments and settings.  Its a story reminiscint of classic tales as Camelot where religion, king, family, and honor were deeply important to everyday life.    Other reviewers have filled in many of the details of the story itself.  Let me just say that the story touches on many of the deepest and most meaningful of human experiences and choices.    I have never, as a middle aged American man, been drawn to tears reading a book...until now.    This is a wonderful, wonderful book that means very much to me.   I cannot wait to see what comes next...and probably read this book again.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|I had an obsession with this book, couldn't wait to get back to reading it each time I put it down and considered staying up all night to finish it on a few occasions.  But I can't say I ever loved the book. I really didn't see the attraction between Em and Dex. I also didn't like any of the characters except Em and then the ending made it all so disappointing for me. I thought Dex and Sylvia deserved each other as she was a female version of him.  His survival of a self indulged and self destructing lifestyle seems unlikely.  He somehow always came out clean on the other side. I just didn't buy it.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|Was it great?  NO.  Did it end the way I thought it should?  NO.  Does that make it a \\"bad\\" book? NO... What does make the book just \\"OK\\" is the 100 or so pages that rehash everything that has happened in the previous books.  Also the way things get left with Dani is kinda a downer.  The book didn't keep my attention as well as the others and the writing seemed a little too jumpy for my tastes.. all the queen/king/concubine/am i?/aren't i?/ what am I? mess was daunting.  What is sad is I know KMM writes better than this... I guess after waiting for so long for this book to come out, I'm more upset it didn't match my expectations.

B003EYVXUU|5.0|Let Me In is truly one of the most beautifully filmed movies of 2010. The vampire story is older than movies, but John Ajvide Lindqvist's story is told from a unique perspective that is original for this genre. \\"Let Me In\\" is the English language version of the story. In the \\"Twilight\\" era this may be difficult to understand -- \\"Let Me In\\" brings the horror story to life while combining it with a sweet, but twisted love story. As many people have pointed out -- this vampire doesn't 'sparkle'.    The choreography is impeccable. One car crash scene has received a lot of deserved praise, but every camera shot and lighting highlights the lonely isolation of the main characters. To enhance the isolation, there are only four main actors within the movie, two of them children. These four actors are simply amazing in the way they bring this story to life.    The movie is a remake of the Swedish \\"Let the Right One In\\". Both are excellent movies in their own right. \\"Let the Right One In\\" emphasizes the innocent love story between the two children. \\"Let Me In\\" uses the story to highlight grand themes. For example, one theme in \\"Let Me In \\" is the difference between 'good' and 'evil'. We always speak of these as two abstract opposites, but in this movie 'good' and 'evil' coexist in the gray area in between. The two movies complement each other well. Some people have loved the Swedish movie so much that they have difficulty enjoying another version. That's unfortunate -- this version is just as good and very different.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I have been watching The Mentalist from the beginning but bought the DVDs because I became aware that there was a lot of sophistication and subtlety in the character and plot development that I was missing on one viewing. I was right. This is a series that has considerable depth. It combines humor, pathos and mystery in what is essentially a moralty play about good and evil. Simon Baker is perfect in the role of Patrick Jane - a clown with a broken heart. He is a 3-dimensional character, something you just don't see in other series. Watch a few episodes and you can write Jane's biography, complete with motivations. You feel for him and want him to achieve the revenge he seeks, while laughing at his clever crime-solving antics. I do hope he gets to tear Red john limb from limb. The episodes can be watched repeatedly with enjoyment. I keep noticing clues and hints for where the character and the plot are heading that create an ongoing suspense. Great acting all around, perfect casting, great script writing. This ranks at the top of all the TV series I've watched.
1439107955|2.0|I had a suspicion this was not my kind of book, but had to check it out first-hand.  It's a fine book, but  not what I wanted, which is more of a scientific, text-book treatment of cancer, from a strictly biological viewpoint, without all the quotes and background history. This is in the Lewis Thomas tradition, whom I find unreadable.
B000KIPT30|5.0|This headphone amplifier is perfect.  The input is a Blu-ray player, and I have Sennheiser HD 480 headphones and a pair of Bose external speakers connected to two of the amp's four outputs.  The amp provides plenty of power with the output control turned up only a fraction of its maximum range.  Compared to other amplifiers I've reviewed or tried, I especially like the fact that this one is powered by AC current rather than a battery that has to be regularly replaced or recharged.  I also like the fact that I can power up to four devices at once.  Finally, the amp is of good, solid construction and weight, especially for the price, which I think is quite reasonable for something of this quality.  As other reviewers have said, the only nuisance is having to get (inexpensive) adapters to connect devices with 3.5 mm plugs to the amp's 1/4 inch receptacles.
0399156577|4.0|Lots of information about dogs, dog training, canine search and rescue -- (and subtly, the training of men) in this book.  Not a typical \\"love at first sight\\" romance, and actually pretty funny in places.      Several things about the book struck me as unrealistic.  For example, every time Fiona and her team engage in a search, she is the one who finds the missing person (i.e. never one of her companions who is also searching).  Also, Fiona lives on a small island in the San Juan Islands, and yet she has enough customers who bring their dogs to her for training that she is able to support herself.      Plot was average and entertaining.  The book is not a \\"keep you awake with fear\\" book.
B002G1YPH0|3.0|After the complicated install, I dropped from 40C idle with stock cooler to a 33C average idle temp. Nothing gigantic, but for the price i guess it was okay. When I moved into the dorms for college however, my temps spiked back up to 40+.    I might be able to blame it on the ambient temperatures, but im not thinking a 10 degree jump could be blamed for that.    Overall, a solid product with good upgradability. It's no Noctua, but for the price I paid it works well.
B004IM14RY|5.0|It seems to me that the least I can do to recognize what must have been a hellish experience for actor Ryan Reynolds is to give this movie five stars. Reynolds powerfully portrays Paul Conroy, an American truck driver in Iraq who is taken hostage by Iraqi extortionists and buried alive. The movie is about how he desperately tries to survive by making contact with an outside world that includes callous terrorists, cold bureaucrats, non-caring \\"friends\\"/relatives, and the heartless company that hired him to go to Iraq. He is also frustrated by people who are not picking up because they are not at home or are not aware of Conroy's plight.    The entire film is shot from the perspective of Conroy, trapped in a coffin. He has a cell phone with camera, a cigarette lighter, and a couple of lights apparently provided by his kidnappers so that he can film a video while he is trapped. Hence, we are able to witness Conroy's terror.    Turns out he also has a companion in the coffin. This companion is not a nubile starlet.    Of course, Reynolds was not really confined in a coffin, but it all still must have been supremely taxing for him.     Although there are elements that stretch credibility, the film kept me enthralled to the end.

0061780308|5.0|I am in love with this story.  Right from the beginning, as the story opens Enzo is in his last 24 hours of life.  He is laying in a pool of his own urine and he is reliving his life....  my first thought at this point is, \\"Oh no.... I hate it when the animals die.\\"  I really do.  I have such a soft heart for animals that books like Old Yeller, just make me crazy angry through my tears....<br /><br />couldn't there have been another ending?<br /><br />However this story quickly carried us to the story of Enzo... fun, brilliant pup to dog.... and he is well worth listening to.  Enzo sees on National Geographic that  in Mongolia, dog owners bury their dog high in the hills so people cannot walk on his grave. The dog's master whispers into the dog's ear his wishes that the dog will return as a man in his next life. Then his tail is cut off and put beneath his head, and a piece of meat or fat is placed in his mouth to sustain his soul on its journey; before he is reincarnated, the dog's soul is freed to travel the land, to run across the high desert plains for as long as it would like.<br /><br />And Enzo is ready.<br /><br />In his own words, here is what he thinks:<br /><br />  \\"Here's why I will be a good person. Because I listen. I cannot talk, so I listen very well. I never deflect the course of the conversation with a comment of my own. People, if you pay attention to them, change the direction of one another's conversations constantly. It's like being a passenger in your car who suddenly grabs the steering wheel and turns you down a side street. For instance, if we met at a party and I wanted to tell you a story about the time I needed to get a soccer ball in my neighbor's yard but his dog chased me and I had to jump into a swimming pool to escape, and I began telling the story, you, hearing the words \\"soccer\\" and \\"neighbor\\" in the same sentence, might interrupt and mention that your childhood neighbor was Pele, the famous soccer player, and I might be courteous and say, Didn't he play for the Cosmos of New York? Did you grow up in New York? And you might reply that, no, you grew up in Brazil on the streets of Tres Coracoes with Pele, and I might say, I thought you were from Tennessee, and you might say not originally, and then go on to outline your genealogy at length. So my initial conversational gambit - that I had a funny story about being chased by my neighbor's dog - would be totally lost, and only because you had to tell me all about Pele. Learn to listen! I beg of you. Pretend you are a dog like me and listen to other people rather than steal their stories.\\"<br /><br />I absolutely adored this story.  It is sad.  It is real.  And it is all told from Enzo's point of view.  I can not recommend this enough.  I adored it on audio and I bet I would have loved it if I had read it too.  Do not miss out on this enchanting read.of New York? Did you grow up in New York?

B002ZG97RE|4.0|Bottom-Line:  \\"Green Zone\\" is a thinking man's movie, and for those who appreciate a rush of adrenaline with their dose of truth.<br /><br />By now everyone knows, or should know that the Iraq War was a mistake.  Those who refuse to deny the truth are either woefully misinformed or not living in the same reality as the rest of us (George W. Bush). War is hell, as anyone who has ever been in one can attest; it is a messy business and there is nothing glamorous about it; people die, lot of people die in ways no human should have to expire.  So the decision to go to war has to be made with all due deliberation, it cannot and should not be made on a whim, we as a nation should have no other recourse but war; war should never be a choice, but an absolute imperative.<br /><br />These are the lessons Green Zone (2010) tried to impart.<br /><br />The Story<br /><br />Directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93), \\"Green Zone\\" is set in the opening days of the Iraq War.  Matt Damon (The Bourne Ultimatum) portrays Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller the leader of a company of men looking for DMD.  But at site after site they keep coming up empty, so Miller starts to question the mission and the reasons for the war.<br /><br />Meanwhile a veteran CIA analyst named Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson ~ Troy) starts questioning the intelligence as well, and locks horns with Pentagon Intelligence Analyst Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear ~ Ghost Town), who has been feeding false information of WMD to the Washington Post through reporter Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan ~ In Treatment).<br /><br />Their worlds intertwine as the victory is declared by the war goes on.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />I enjoyed Green Zone.  Although this movie is fiction, it is inspired by the work of actual journalist who covered the events surrounding the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the botched intelligence handed down about the weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) that were supposed to found there. From start to finish the movie was engaging, fast paced, intelligent, and well-acted.  I have never been one to give into conspiracy theories, but the yarn that unraveled in Green Zone is not so far-fetched.<br /><br />Matt Damon, as he is wont to do, turned in an excellent performance as the Warrant Officer (based on a real character) bent on finding the meaning in the senselessness that became the Iraq War.  And supporting cast were a fine complement.<br /><br />\\"Green Zone\\" is a thinking man's movie, and for those who appreciate a rush of adrenaline with their dose of truth. Green Zone is tightly focused never meandering too far from the lack of WMD and how that translates into erroneous and bogus war.  Some may berate the not so subtle political slate that undergirds this movie, but it is one well worth listening to and heeding for the future.t, and well-acted.

B00003CXC7|5.0|So much has been said about this movie already, what's one more long description of the plot going to do?  If you want to know the entire plot, read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.<br /><br />I find Rear Window (1954) to be entertaining, fun, suspenseful, and a little scary at times all rolled into one.  The biggest reason why I like this movie is because Grace Kelly is in it.  She was a looker and her performance in this movie was Oscar-worthy.  She plays the role of Lisa Carol Fremont, who is the girlfriend of L.B. \\"Jeff\\" Jeffries, played by Jimmy Stewart.  Stewart's performance was also great.  Grace Kelly reminds me so much of Nicole Kidman, or should I say that Nicole Kidman reminds me of Grace Kelly.  Kidman's overall look she had in The Others (2001) is so similar to Kelly's look in Rear Window, especially during the early part of Rear Window.  Kidman's character name coincidentally in The Others is Grace Stewart.<br /><br />This movie takes place entirely in an apartment complex where the rear windows of all apartments are open and expose what is going on inside each apartment that overlooks a courtyard.  It's funny to watch Jimmy Stewart's character take part in voyeurism.  But his voyeurism pays off as he and several people are able to solve a murder that took place in an apartment across the courtyard.  The suspense builds as the movie progresses.<br /><br />This DVD is in widescreen format.  The extras are excellent.  There is a documentary called Rear Window Ethics: Remembering and Restoring a Hitchcock Classic, which describes the making of the movie with interviews with cast and crew, Hitchcock himself through an audio interview, and Hitchcock's daughter.  It also shows how the movie was restored.  Also included is a featurette with screenwriter John Michael Hayes.  Other extras include production photographs, the theatrical trailer, a re-release trailer narrated by Jimmy Stewart, production notes, cast and filmmakers, and access to the original script.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies.  I highly recommend it.l script.       Overall, this is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies.  I highly recommend it.

0345528581|4.0|I was a gym rat and avid weight lifter.  However, with the birth of my second child, I was finding it nearly impossible to get to the gym.  I pre-ordered this book with low expectations. I'd tried a body weight regimen before with limited results(Matt Furey...groan). While waiting for my book to arrive, I bought a cable pulley style home exercise machine to hedge my bets. Well...the exercise machine is collecting dust and my copy of this book is dog-eared.    I was quickly impressed with the encyclopedia of exercises and the sample routines that are spelled out for you.  I've been doing this program for about 40 weeks.  My strength and endurance have improved dramatically, especially in my core.  I've progressed from the 1st class program to the Chief Class.    I recommend this book if you are already motivated.  If you need someone holding you accountable, pass this up unless you're looking for ideas to supplement the occasional odd day off from the gym.  You don't need to be in great shape already and the progressions are very reasonable(You won't kill yourself and abandon the program two weeks in).    I have a first edition and kindle version.  I deducted a star because you will probably need to utilize the website to fully understand some of the workouts.  The new edition may have addressed some of these FAQs however.    P.S. Highly recommended for military and law enforcement personnel.
1433210428|5.0|I read this book some 20 years ago.  But through age and experience, this time,it had more meaning and relevance.  I purchased a CD copy of it right around Christmas.  My 23 year old daughter was diagnosed with a serious disease and we needed something that would encourage us to fight on.  We read the Holy bible of course, but I wanted something that was raw and biographical that would let us know that we could make it in spite of the odds.  This book did just that.  It is a must read for a number of reasons.  Read it before you need to read it and walk the road to enlighenment with Dr.Victor Frankl.
B004A8ZX14|2.0|A young couple begin a friends with benefits relationship, with the man wanting more, while the woman resists commitment. This leads to the inevitable, and predictable scenario of will they, or won't they, come together? The movie is at times crude, and is not as funny as it thinks it is. There was an occasional laugh, and Natalie Portman is a strong lead. However, with standard elements of the genre present, I would like to say it is a run-of-the-mill romantic-comedy, but that would be an insult to romantic-comedies everywhere.

B004ECFW94|4.0|I enjoyed this video quite well.  It would not be my 'desert island' Boccanegra and I don't know if I would return to it often but I was very interested to see and hear Placido Domingo in the title role and I enjoyed him immensely.  Of course, you might wish for a bit of a deeper sound in the title role, but the fact that he is 70 years old, and still delivering very satisfying performances is downright thrilling.  He is very touching and it is enjoyable to see him in a role where he physically fits the character more than the young, tenor characters we have seen him in, but that don't quite match his physical maturity now.    The miscasting in my opinion was James Morris, whose voice is far from rich an simply isn't low enough to create and exciting Fiesco.  Not quite a fiasco of a Fiesco - but dull.    I found Pieczonka very enjoyable with a pretty, easy-to-hear voice.  I didn't notice her being off-key as someone else seemed to.  Also, I found Giordani in quite good voice and I enjoyed him very much.  The Paolo was pleasant-voiced, but perhaps could have been a bit more dynamic.    If you have never seen this opera, and want a more rounded out version vocally, the earlier Met version with Placido in the tenor role is a better choice, with Chernov in the title role and in exceptional voice.  Te Kananawa sings Amelia in the earlier video and Robert Lloyd is a much more acceptable Fiesco.

B000AM6OQ2|5.0|to answer reviewer E. Joseph's query of why this film has an R rating.  19 minutes into the movie, we see an explicit scene containing violence.  There are a few others.  Anyway, the film itself is pretty good in itself.  Not my top favorite of the genre, but it does make the list.  I had originally seen this film when it first ran in cinemas back in 1980.      Good atmosphere.  I loved the scenic view of the lighthouse & the waves crashing on the rocks.  Worth a watch.
0312944926|1.0|I was curious to read this because I had read 3 of his other titles.  This is by far the worst, and not just of Dan Brown but of all time.  One of the most annoying books I have ever read.  I hated the characters and the writing was just awful.  You can tell it was his first book.  The heroine especially was so pathetic, and crying and whining the whole time as she runs around the NSA in her Ferragamo pumps. Plus the puzzles were so easy to solve but it took the characters like 20 pages to figure out.  Why are we paying these supposed NSA geniuses so much money?!!!  The only good part was David running around Spain.  He actually had some good ideas of how to find people.  His sections were entertaining but the rest was trash.  And not good trash, not even laughably bad.  Just really pointless.  You can totally skip this unless you want a lesson on how to write a sucky novel.  Deception Point was way better.  Of course Da Vinci Code is his best, but he totally stole the central theme from the Holy Blood, Holy Grail guys.

I was late for work this morning because I just couldn't lay down my Kindle until I finished this wonderful story.
0316098337|4.0|I was a bit nervous when I read the synopsis of this book and found out it was told from the point of view of a 5 year old.  I wondered how the story could have depth, or even make sense from this POV.  I was mistaken.  Donoghue did a wonderful job of capturing the innocent naivety of Jack, while mixing in dailogue of the other characters.    The story line is chilling; immediately you want to know how and why Jack and his Mother are living in one room, never venturing outdoors.  When you find out and the story unravels, the book is impossible to put down.      I only gave the 4/5 because there were some dry areas of the story when the focus was on Jack's point of view for too long, with no interjections of other character dialogue.    Love it overall!
1595141715|5.0|I picked up Thirteen Reasons Why because a friend recommended it to me, and I am so glad I did. It was gripping, chilling, and haunting. I thought Asher portrayed suicide very realistically with a series of events leading up to why Hannah to decided to end her life.      The narrator, Clay, is a decent guy. I was in suspense as I was reading because I wanted to know why Hannah put him on one of the tapes. I felt bad for him at times for all of the things he was going through as he listened to the tapes. I liked Clay as a narrator because he seemed to have really cared about Hannah even though he did not know her that well.    I would recommend this book to anyone who can handle it because it is a difficult topic to read. It was an excellent story, and the kind that stays with you long after you finish it. I liked how Asher wrote it so as to incorporate both Clay's and Hannah's voices at the same time. I thought that was very original. In one sentence: Thirteen Reasons Why is brilliant.
0312600844|5.0|Freedom took me several months to read, because I just couldn't take it all the time. You have to be in the mood--this is no light-hearted read, but a reminder of all that is wrong in our society. That said, Jonathan Franzen is a gifted writer and it is a pleasure to read his words. I do believe this is destined to become a classic. If you wish to read it quickly, check out of your library...if a more leisurely pace is preferred in reading fiction, buy.
0545123275|5.0|Shiver is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. The more times I read it, the more I love it. It is absolutely amazing! Maggie Stiefvater is an extremely talented writer. The way she writes is just beautiful and almost poetic. I think her version of werewolves is original and interesting.    The main characters, Grace and Sam, are amazing characters. I enjoyed how each chapter was in either Grace's or Sam's point of view. Often times when a book has more than one character's point of view, I find myself liking one character's thoughts more than others. In Shiver, this was not the case at all. I enjoyed both point of views equally. I loved how independent and real Grace is and how sweet and good Sam is. Their love is so beautiful that I could not help but fall in love with Sam.    Shiver is definitely one of my favorite books. It had me smiling at the adorable parts between Grace and Sam, laughing at Grace's humor, and getting teary-eyed when it all seemed to come crashing down. If you have not read Shiver, I highly recommend that you do.
B00006ADGP|1.0|I watched this horrible rendition of a badly dubbed, lousy VHS copy of an originally fine film and thanked God I didn't buy the DVD---which has to be a Chinese knockoff.  This is what NetFlix is sending out to customers.  I told them about it.  No info on the disc but the title and that's it!  Isn't this what the FBI wants to know about?  I wonder if Sophia knows about this.
030746363X|5.0|This book is very well written, informative, unique and at times pretty funny. Tim Ferriss spent a lot of time researching everything in this book, going so far as to experiment each different tidbit on himself. He offers information in a straightforward manner with no affiliation or obligation to hock a certain product. There are some great ideas for transforming your life, and Tim breaks them down so that they don't seem overwhelming. I recommend this book to anyone who either wants to lose weight, get stronger, or just enjoys fitness and well being.
0425188809|5.0|This is for everyone who believes that nihilism (AKA modern art and Stephen King) is a  soulkiller.  This is for anyone who has had a dog who was their guardian angel.(Windy, we're talking about you.)  This is for those of us who love humanity and know that reason, love and faith are what separates us from monsters.  And this is beautifully written, and makes us women envy Gerda Koontz for the man she married.

B0042816YK|2.0|The way they hyped up this movie and book - whose premise I really do like - I expected a nice piece depicting someone's journey through self-discovery. Instead, it turned out to be a trite two hour movie depicting the shameless self-indulgences and superficiality of a vain person on the quest for the elusive \\"finding yourself\\" mantra she undoubtedly read up upon in the self help aisle at Barnes and Noble. Because of how the character acted and was portrayed, the audience just never gets to identify and empathize with her and her \\"problems\\". For two hours you sit there and watch her whine about her life, how it is/was so unhappy and unfulfilled and what have you, but you never know why really. If the goal is to have the audience empathize with a character and identify with it, they have to know what's bothering them, be let in on their pain and unhappiness. That is what makes a great movie. The writers in this one seemed to want the audience to just take their word for it that she was unhappy and unfulfilled - despite all evidence to the contrary. Someone once said if the problem is in one's head, it still is a problem. But in this movie, we never get to see what that is - imagined or real. The worst thing a movie maker can do is create unrelateable characters.     Julia Roberts did a lousy job and her character is both unlikeable and unrelateable. This movie is supposed to tell us that material things and money are not the source to happiness and that there are other sources of happiness unrelated to such external things. Yet the main character (Roberts) spends a year travelling around the world living in great places that cost a lot of money. Later on, this movie promoted a lip-gloss by Lnacome or something. Yeah...way to send a message about material things not mattering. They should have pointed out that trying to find yourself when you are broke is much harder to do. Luckily, Roberts in this movie didn't have to worry about that \\"tiny detail\\". One should be solucky to have so much money that it is not worth mentioning anymore - even though it still is used to buy you all the sanity and self-discovery trips in the world.     But it is not just that. The main character was annoying for other reasons as well. I mean her spiritual guide is a self-announced medicine man in Bali with amnesia. Yes amnesia, as in brain damage. She turns her life upside down because of the random crap he made up and told her, and then a year later when she goes back, to tell her \\"mentor\\" what she did, he doesnt even remember her!! It was hilarious. I thought they were kidding and that at this point the movie would take a turn; that her character would finally realize how immature and insane it was to do all those things to herself based on the random musings of a silly, old man who doesnt even know her. But NO. It stayed. That was it. Oh so conveniently, the shaman starts suddenly remembering her after she is about to burst into tears at the realization that she might have screwed up her life based on the words of a random, senile man.  That's deep.     The movie went downhill from there at an alarming rate. I have never seen so much substance-deficiency and implausibility of both story and characters packed into two hours or so of narcissistic screen time for a middle-aged actress. The supporting characters were unlikable too and Julia Roberts just seemed too old and burned out for some of the \\"boys\\" she dated - like James Franco. They wanted to make it look like her relationship with Franco - which she started 5 minutes after her divorce by the way - didnt work out for other deep reasons, like she loved him, but it is obvious that it didnt work out cause she is too old for him and he a vacuous moron.  And then Javier Bardem. Obviously both of these people are on rebound, especially Bardem (who is 39 and has a 20 year old son but ok) but still after a couple of weeks of humping in the tropical hut, he confesses his ever endearing love for her like a starry-eyed 17 year old teenager. I seriously thought she knew better and would respond that she didnt feel the same way, that she didnt love him. But ta da, it turns out - despite all evidence to the contrary and what we see - she is in fact madly in love with him but (how original) is too scared to admit it cause she is afraid to get hurt. Yeah right. Could they have packed any more lame cliches into that?     They could and they did because in the end, just like any other woman I guess, all she needed obviously to get out of her funk was love and riding off into the sunset (literally) with her man.     Coming out of this garbage they tried to pass as a \\"wonderful journey\\" I figured that not only did I not get anything out of this movie and the supposed journey, but that obviously neither did the protagonist. Just as we never found out why she was really having a crisis and was unhappy, we also never find out why and how she got happy again. This movie is based on the premise that she lost her mojo and needed to find it, but looking closer it seems that she never had it. After that one year of travelling and exploring and meeting all these supposedly cool and enlightened people (quitters is more like it, see Bardem's character), she doesnt seem to have found more purpose in life than before. She doesnt look and act changed, enlightened or as if she had gained some insight into who she really is and what she really wants out of life. She spent a year travelling around, \\"hanging out\\" and having a good time and all she got to show for is a man. As expected, because by being a self-absorbed, spoiled brat who never had to do a hard day's work in life and doesn't listen to people you are not likely to gain insight into anything. Spiritually, she could have been Carrie Bradshaw's sidekick when she went into hysteria.     In the end, she is exactly where she started: nowhere, drowning in her own superficiality and shallow-ness. The only exciting thing in her life will be a long distance relationship with Bardem between Bali and New York until she gets bored again and leaves, thinking that maybe the answers in life are to be found in the elusive wisdom of this one medicine man she read up upon on her last trip to the self help aisle - this time at Borders.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|It's only natural for many of us to hear about this movie, and stay away from it: after all, it's a movie based off of a video game. How good could it be? Answer: very good. Surprisingly, this movie's a lot of fun, despite the many fight scenes. Jake Gyllenhaal turns Dastan, the main character, into someone you want to root for. He may get on your nerves sometimes, but all in all, Dastan is someone you want to win in the end.<br />The storyline--while somewhat confusing the first time I saw this movie--makes more sense the second time around. It is a rather silly storyline, but generally well put together.<br />The [[ASIN:B003M64XUM Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time]]soundtrack proves that Harry Gregson-Williams gets better all of the time--some parts of the score sound like they could have come from the soundtrack for Lawrence of Arabia, which I see as a great compliment to Gregson-Williams, and shows his growing skill as a composer.<br />The wide variety of great actors, well-known and not yet as well-known, all help contribute to this movie.<br />Prince of Persia is definitely worth watching.<br />(One-disc edition has one special feature: \\"An Unseen World: Making Prince of Persia\\".)

She has a substantive and compelling \\"voice\\" and an art for storytelling, even though the story is her own.

030746363X|5.0|This book has improved my health and my marriage! I like how the book is sectioned off so you don't have to read through it like a novel, although I thought his findings were so interesting that I did. I think everyone should read this book with healthy skepticism, as the author suggests, and do your own experiments on what works for your body. This book, and his findings are awesomely inspiring, motivating, and optimistic. I think everyone should find at least 50 things in here that are helpful to their specific needs and appropriate for their health and fitness levels. I know I have found much much more!     I have the kindle edition, which can also be downloaded on a computer/smartphone for easy access to all the links. His blog is also a great resource for links, resources, new experiments, bonus material, corrections to the book, videos of the exercises, and any questions you have for the author. I would also recommend reading through the comments as there are many helpful suggestions from the 4HB community!     One concern I had after reading his exercise recommendations was that this would not be sufficient for increasing my lung capacity and endurance. I was wrong! The kettlebell swings have greatly improved my asthma! I use a modified dumbbell with an attachment for a pendulum swing. This was a tip I gleaned from his blog comments and I am already getting results after one week! Don't underestimate the advice in this book!

B004EE30DW|5.0|I think a lot of people who have been disappointed with this album may not get the point of The King Is Dead.  I also think that seeing the DVD that comes in this set will help put things in perspective as well.<br /><br />After several epic albums it was time for Colin and the band to work on something minimal, something simple.  The King Is Dead is a nice sidestep from the other more grand sounds from albums like Hazards of Love and The Crane Wife.  The first thing that I thought of when I heard the album was that the country, Americana sound reminded me of Colin Meloy's previous band Tarkio.  It is different, that's for sure.  No pirate inspired shanties and no big story inspired songs, but the sounds of Chris Funk working the slide guitar and Colin's heartfelt vocals make it a great, lazy day album.  The big songs, like \\"Rox in the Box\\" and \\"Down by the Water\\" are still smaller compared to some other albums, but really, if you're a true fan of this amazingly talented group of musicians you'll be able to appreciate this album for what it is and what they have tried to capture.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|Orchestra and strings just seem right for all of these songs. Stings voice and the arrangements have never been better. I find this release to get to the soul of Sting. His commentary is poignant without being sappy and I found this to be his most emotional concert ever. It doesn't get much better and in Sting's case this is his best ever. I have been watching and watching and listening and listening to this over and over again.    Curious as to why they offered songs on the CD that aren't on the DVD and visa versa. It would have been sweet to have the full catalog on the DVD. Especially since the format is capable of having all of the songs.
B000PMG16U|1.0|Lucas is a very greedy man and has not written or directed anything even remotely decent since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which he ruined by making scooby doo and the mystery of the alien heads(aka the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls. Everything since the Last Crusade has been awful which includes these three embarrassing movies. Both Anakins are horrible Horrrible HORRIBLE actors and the Chemistry between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman is terrible, which you really have to try for because Portman is very sensual (see closer). The dialog is garbage the movies are garbage and I doubt that they will look better in HD!! Thanks Lucas for being such Bantha poodoo.
B0007KS7D0|5.0|Macro photography has many paths to achieve acceptable results.  Extension tubes, reversing lenses, a dedicated macro lens and or course a close-up lens like the DCR-150.    One of the negative aspects of close-up lenses is that they normally come for just one size.   The DCR-150 comes with an adapter that lets me use it many lens sizes and it works great (see notes below).  This has enabled me to test with various lenses, an 18-55mm Kit lens, an 1.4f 50mm prime, an 2.8f 28-75mm Tamron zoom and a 70-300mm Tamron super zoom all on a Pentaz K-r camera body.    Before the DCR-150 of all my lenses the 18-55mm Kit lens and the 70-300mm Tamron had the best macro performance out of the box.  If I inverted the 50mm prime I could get an impressive macro resolution but this setup is less than ideal (even if the results are very good).    So I tried the DCR-150 with all my lenses and the results were VERY surprising:    Pentax 18-55mm 3.5-5.6 II kit lens results:  Very impressive results, I would say this was close to 50% more magnification.  Could focus to like 6 inches from the subject now.    Pentax  1.4f 50mm prime results:  I got better magnification than before but nothing to talk about, the kit lens was better.    Tamron 2.8f 28-75mm results:  Worst result from my testing.  Not better than my Pentax  1.4f 50mm prime in magnification with the added problem of totally dark corners.  The kit lens did much better.  I was surprised as this is a full frame lens.    Tamron 70-300mm results:  The lens has a dedicated macro mode from 180-300 mm, it also has a focusing distance of 1 meter in this mode.  When I put the DCR-150 on this lens I was TOTALLY blown away.  I could focus as close as 18 inches and the magnification was better than ANYTHING I had used before (better than the inverted 50mm prime).  Unfortunately this lens is not very sharp at 300mm but at 180mm it can be quite decent at f8 - f13.  At 180mm it was still WAY better than any of my other options.    In EVERY case the minimum focus distance was reduced for all my lenses (this is what a close-up lens is supposed to do).  Beware of lenses that already have a VERY small focusing distance (think like an inch) as they will not play nice with this (or any) close-up lens.    What about the images?  In all the lenses (minus the Tamron 2.8f 28-75mm with the dark edges, hated that) the DCR-150 did not degrade the image in any way I could detect.  There is some lost in brightness but this is actually common in macro photography, even for dedicated macro lenses.     Now before you get too exited let me explain a FEW issues you need to be aware off.  From f8 to f13 (where I like to shoot macros) there is VERY LITTLE depth of field at these small focusing distances.  Also, the closer you are to your subject the less depth of field you will have and the harder it will be to focus.    In all of my testing I had to use a tripod, manual focus and use the camera live view to get the right focus.  Even then it was not always easy to focus.  There was a point that the smallest movement would take the picture out of focus.    In this regard if I was shooting hand held less magnification would not be a bad thing.  For hand held shoots I would consider the Pentax 18-55mm 3.5-5.6 II kit lens as a better option than the Tamron 70-300mm to carry around.  There is just so much you can do hand held.  This is not an issue with the DCR-150 itself, you could have this same issue with a dedicated macro lens too.    So I conclude that the DCR-150 is a great, inexpensive and versatile close-up lens.  Just keep in mind that your experience with it can be totally different depending on what lenses you have available to you.

This movie's Ethan Hunt is an adrenaline junkie who is suddenly 'the man'    I can suspend disbelief for the sake of a story, but even I have to draw the line somewhere.    If you like John Woo, then you will most likely enjoy this movie (criticism's of Tom Cruise notwithstanding..)  If you enjoyed the character premise of the first movie (that was brought back a bit in the third..), then you will not like this movie    The latter is where I fall and sadly this movie just doesn't hold its own.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Just like anyone else when this movie was out in theatres, and saw the preview, I was stumped, wanted to see it, but had no idea what this was all really about. This movie tailors to all types of audiences, be it a geek, or an action junkie, this movie gives it all. The dream world is a very interesting aspect of the psychosis, and this movie does a magnificent job in making the intangible very much so tangible. In retrospect though, it does seem a little impossible to be able to traverse 3 levels of dreams all instantaneously and with different time tables, it was a necessity to be able to make this movie function. Great movie with great actors.. Extras a must to see how the feat of anti-gravity was accomplished in a world full of gravity.
0316069485|3.0|I had strayed entirely from the mystery/thriller genre for years until I discovered Michael Connelly several years ago.  His writing is unusually intelligent - the details of the police procedurals  ring true; the dialogue feels natural and in his early novels there are often striking passages of literary prose that betray an obvious Raymond Chandler influence. His grasp of LA, both geographically and sociologically is dead-on.    But Connelly's recent books have felt more stripped down and prosaic - often feeling more uninspired and deadline-influenced. They're entertaining and competent. Just not the gems some of his earlier novels were.    \\"The Reversal\\" falls into that category. (Incidentally, did he let John Grisham  title this book for him?)    \\"The Reversal\\" lacks the twists and surprises of many of his earlier books, which usually begin as a small case that mushrooms into something bigger.  This story is notably lacking in mystery and ultimately lacking in pay-off.    Connelly's major character is LA police detective \\"Harry\\" Bosch.  In recent years several books have featured high-priced lawyer Mickey Haller and the two have put in cameos in the other's books until it was revealed they were long-lost half-brothers.  \\"The Reversal\\" is the first novel to feature the two characters as co-stars.  Connelly writes the Haller chapters in the first person perspective that the Haller books  are written in.  The Bosch chapters  are written third-person, like the Bosch series.  The alternating first-person and third-person chapters are sometimes jarring and seem to only be written that way since Connelly opted to stay true to the voice of the Haller books. If this  were a reader's first Connelly book, I'm not sure if they would find this devise clever - or just a confusing conceit.    The lack of richness of Connelly's prose in this effort is equalled by the oddly missed opportunity of exploring the relationship between the two half-brothers, which would have seemed the natural emotional theme for this novel.  The two adults recently realized they were brothers after being acquaintances  and don't quite know what to make of one another.  Working together on a case would seem to be the natural opportunity for them to bond.  But Connelly simply doesn't go there.  No connection is made. No attempt at a connection is made. There is no character arc for either man in the story. Their young daughters become briefly acquainted in a rather 'off-camera' manner...and  that's it.      Those unfamiliar with Connelly's work would be better suited being introduced to him by reading one of his earlier novels.

B000W4D94I|5.0|I grew up in Norman, OK and I loved this movie. It brought back memories of running to the storm shelter through blinding rain, serious lightening, and a good pelting with hail.  In the movie, when the sky turned a bruised blue-green and the music followed suit, it brought back a fear of storms that I have carried my whole life! Someone really did their homework on this story.  I no longer live in Oklahoma and I really miss the fantastic cloud formations I witnessed.  This film has its critics but I am here to tell you that they captured the suspense and fear connected with living in \\"TORNADO ALLEY\\"!!!! When they were making this film, in particular when the farm equipment was blown down the road, the actors were hurt from flying debris.  How real can you get without killing someone!!!  And NO ONE MENTIONED STEPHEN SPIELBURG'S PART IN THE MAKING OF THIS FILM.....
B000063DFN|5.0|There are enough reviews that this probably will never get read, but lemme just say that the first two tracks are cool, but they're just hits. That usually means that if someone thinks they are the best on the album, they probably don't have the IQ or the attention span to really listen.  That is not totally fair to say, as fans of vocals may like those more for their catchiness, but this album is a power metal/ progressive metal masterpiece where the instruments shine supreme.  Los'fer words is where POWERSLAVE truly begins, and these tracks all have spectacular riffs, giant builds and releases of tension, and ripping guitar solos. Back in the Village might be the only weak spot, as it has one of the coolest intro riffs, but does not have the same sort of build that the rest of the songs do.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|If you want tearing solos, this is the best metal album for guitar buffs.  Tearing solos and layered, complicated rhythms make this album a barn burner.  Vocals are alright, but its Mustaine... so listener be warned.  The songs are all entertainingly complex, and the drum and bass work is the most technical of any Megadeth album as well.    The most progressive and technical of Megadeth albums    Warning:  the remastered and remixed version isn't quite as good overall.

It is worth picking up the remixed remastered for working out or something with headphones, but the original will sound better on stereos n such.
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Eric Clapton fans will love this latest release. Great guitar solos. Some old standards and, as always, a taste of the blues.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|DDVd was clear & no skips. Game was great. I understood more about \\"Lost\\" than when it was on TV due to watching all of the DVD's without commercials or Season Breaks. Excellent show. There will never be another \\"Lost\\". This was the Ultimate Show!!!

1401227821|5.0|Every time I went to actually buy this book on Amazon, they were sold out. It appears to be sold out just about everywhere now. I've always been a fan of Adam Hughes, but I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of just a DC art book. I would have loved to see something covering a range of his other works. But after picking this book up, I see why-he's really done a lot of crap for DC! I had no idea. About 90% of the book is Catwoman and Wonder Woman covers. I'm not a fan of either character that much, but I couldn't love this book more. Being an artist myself, it is really inspirational. Most of the pages are full page paintings with a brief description and sketches of how the piece came together. If you're a fan of comic art, it doesn't get any better than this. I just hope he releases an art book including his work for other companies.
B0039TD826|4.0|A 5-star album reduced to 4 stars because of the \\"overdone\\" (re-)remaster. As the knowledgeable reviewer at AllMusic.com said of this latest attempt (IMO) to capitalize on the Stones' legacy,\\" [m]uch of its myth lies in its murk, how its dense, scuzzy sound is the quintessential portrait of rock stars in decadent isolation, the legend bleeding into its creation so thoroughly it is impossible, and unnecessary, to separate one from the other.\\" Unlike Bob Ludwig who did a superb job remastering Exile in 1994 for Virgin, somewhat cleaning it up, but leaving its essential nature, those responsible for this remaster have missed the point: this originally was a low-def album, probably done that way on purpose, and certainly reflecting the atmosphere under which it was created. The \\"murk and the scuzz\\" were part of it - the album could have easily been entitled \\"Torn and Frayed\\" after Track 7. But this new 2010 remaster cleans up all that scuzz; granted, you can now hear every instrument clearly, but I for one want that original murky, scuzzy sound. Exile was never about clarity. Unfortunately, many contemporary remasters are often more about the engineers, who end up outsmarting themselves, than the musical legacy they're trying to preserve - for one thing, they inevitably do it too loud (no doubt to grab attention) as this one has been.  If you can, try to compare this one with the Ludwig 1994 remaster - huge difference in loudness level for one thing.<br /><br />Exile received at least as many lukewarm reviews as it did ecstatic ones when it first came out in 1972 - not surprising as it was a double album (the Stones' first) that took a while to get into, like the White Album, Tusk and many others. Now it's considered one of the best (#1 in the minds of many) of the Stones' Big Four (the others being Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers - BB remains my personal favourite, though Exile is firmly #2!).<br /><br />My recommendation - while you still can, get a copy of the 1994 remastering by Robert Ludwig, who is one of the (very few) truly great mastering engineers working today. Better still, maybe, get a good used vinyl copy (2 records - preferably original pressing), hopefully with some hiss, pops and ticks to enhance the murk and scuzz - remember, folks, this is Exile!<br /><br />Thanks for putting up with the long review (but this is a long album!)remastering by Robert Ludwig, who is one of the (very few) truly great mastering engineers working today.

0891419063|5.0|With the Old breed is a fantastic story of the Marines in the Pacific.  it should be read by anyone who wants to feel how it was fighting in the pacific theatre during ww 2. It is well written and very poignant. I recommend this book to everyone.
B002ZG999U|3.0|I figured I would give Sylvester another go after hearing good things about this movie.  All I can say is, it is what it is.  The Expendables is meant to be a pure action movie.  There is a plot, though you really can't figure out what it is.  Some of the scenes are as awkward as that moment when you can't decide to either shake hands or hug and at times the script seems forced.  But if you want a typical shoot em up tough guy movie then this is spot on.  Ladies be warned, if enough of us men get together and watch this the testosterone alone is going to destory the house.    When people told me this movie was low budget, I had really expected worse.  I must say that I was surprised with how it all turned out.  Sure it wasn't the best, but 90% of the scenes were extremely well done and most of the action was maxed out.  A bit of a slow start but once it gets to rolling it doesn't stop.  I was disappointed in the star-studded cast.  The meeting between Bruce Willis, Stallone and Schwarzenegger seems to be more of an empty gesture to fans.  Expendables could have existed fine without this scene and it is confusing, seems to be a space filler, and just an opprotunity to give Willis and the Governator a few seconds of time. Statham did his usual five star job, Jet Li was the kind of character you just have to love, and Rourke was off the chain entertaining as a tattoo artist bad a** named Tool.  Steve Austin?  Awesome actor, baaaaaaad character.  The rest of the line up seem to be supporting cast.    If you want something that will blow your windows out when it comes through your surround sound, something that men can get together and eat beef jerky while watching and then go out and shoot up the neighborhood road side trash cans then this is it.  Gotta be in the right company to enjoy.  Personally I would give it 4 stars but I'm going by this: Can just anyone pick this up and truly be entertained?  I don't think so.
1400052173|5.0|All I've got to say is Rebecca Skloot has my total respect for working with Deborah during this book. Deborah had such a desire to learn as much about her mother as she could. Not knowing her mother when all the world knew her name had to be so frustrating. Then to discover that parts of her mother were alive all over the world had to be confusing. I commend her for taking the initiative to read all she could get her hands on in regards to the HeLa cells, even though she had no understanding and had to read the book with a dictionary at her disposal.<br /><br />This is not the type book you set aside when finished. It makes me think about Henrietta and her family, wondering how they are and if they have forgiven the scientists that were so callous in how they treated their family member during the collection and treatment of her cancer. I can't imagine what she went through. Pain medication was not as effective in the '50's, but I think a bigger effort could have been taken to make sure she had pain relief. I've worked with cancer patients and know that you can give morphine quite frequently to help with the pain and in larger doses.  Side effects and addiction aren't the worry, it is more to allow the patient dignity in their final days. The health care workers knew that Henrietta wasn't going to make it, they could have done more to help ease her into Glory.<br /><br />I would like to extend a heartfelt word of thanks to the family for their participation in the writing of this book. It is a wonderful tribute to your family and to Henrietta. It has impacted me and how I feel about the things done in the name of science. I can tell you that I would not hesitate to donate cells and/or organs to research. When I see how much these cells advanced medicine, I'd be willing to allow mine to be tested in any way to get the same results if at all possible. I am not saying this to diminish how you feel, but rather to tell you that I am so thrilled that her cells have done the things they have, it must be a huge source of pride for you! Thank you and Thank you Rebecca Skloot for putting the information together in such a way that it humanized the woman and explained the science without becoming boring or too wordy.<br /><br />I sense your feeling of loss at the end of the book, I felt it too.e, it must be a huge source of pride for you! Thank you and Thank you Rebecca Skloot for putting the information together in such a way that it humanized the woman and explained the science without becoming boring or too wordy.

044654759X|5.0|I love my kindle!    Thanks go to my daughter who gifted me with my kindle.  I absolutely love having it to support my hobby - READING.  When I cannot afford to purchase a book, I can read one of the many FREE ones.  I am presently reading Safe Haven by Nicholas Sparks.  I first read Mr. Sparks when he co-wrote a book with James Patterson.  Patterson is my favorite author of fiction.  Thank you for your product!!!    Miss Kay
044654759X|5.0|I agree with some of the reviews that said most of the Nicholas Sparks books are all lovey-dovey. Hard to take when we know how rocky relationships can be. It's too bad that women in the type of marriage Erin was in don't get to read these books. I think it is a good 'how to' on getting out of said marriage.<br /><br />Anyway, the book is interesting, the twist at the end was unexpected! I loved that he tossed that in the book.<br /><br />I get all of my books on CD to listen to while commuting at least 45 min-1hr one way to work. This book had me wanting more so I took it into the house and listened while cleaning on the weekend, I couldn't bear to wait at least 3 more days to get to the end. I'll donate it to the local library now for others to enjoy.

0312600844|1.0|I read this book because I had seen all the great reviews but it was the most furstrating and self indulgent and unbelievable book.  There was not one character in this book that I could believe.  What I get from the book is a frustrated author who definitely has issues with women and sex in his life. I would recommend Mr. Franzen get some therapy, writes an auto bio and call it a day.      I tried to read Corrections so that I would give the author the benefit of the doubt but its basically the same characters and same story. Selfish men, men obsessed with sex (not really love) and weak/mean women.    Worst book of the year.
6305311463|2.0|Michael Bay's films are ones of disdain. Disdain toward the viewer and cinema itself. Throughout \\"Armageddon\\", as he does with his other films, Bay wastes no time in insulting the intelligence of the viewer with implausible scenarios (using a gatling gun, attached to a planetary rover, to shoot through the debris of a space shuttle), cliche imagery and dialogue (witness the scenes of Americana supposed to represent some non-existant ideal of this country found only in boring Norman Rockwell paintings), and his signature use of hyper-kinetic filming and editing. Bay's style of filming and editing, learned from his days as a commercial and \\"Playboy\\" director, eschew the conventional, letting a scene linger, allowing the viewer to take in the nuance and \\"read\\" the film for him or herself. Instead, Bay uses this hyper-kineticism to seemingly propel the plot forward, adding layer upon layer of absurdity which leaves the viewer no time to realize just what he or she is watching (and indeed may explain how people continue flocking to his films). It is to Bay's advantage that he does this, however. \\"Pearl Harbor\\", his following film, does away, for the most part, with this style of filming. Rather, Bay focuses on scenes, slowly taking in the imagery and actors. Doing so reveals Bay's films for what they are: disgustingly trite and with no substance or redeeming value whatsoever.
B001EN71DG|5.0|Here's the bottom line. This box set is well worth getting. It contains the original theatrical releases of the original Star Wars trilogy and the most recent special editions of each film. You get to see Star Wars as it was when it first came out and George Lucas's final product. The only downside would be that the bonus disc from the special editions box set ([[ASIN:B0001YRVN4 Star Wars Trilogy (Full Screen Edition with Bonus Disc)]]) is not included, but that could easily be found online.
B001GCUO5M|3.0|This is Martin Scorsese doing another salute to Hitchcock, as with his remake of \\"Cape Fear\\", and obviously having FUN doing it. But I expect a  master filmmaker like Scorsese, who knows EVERY film genre and technique like the back of his hand, to take a familiar genre the average filmmaker would MAKE average, and create a film that kicks it up MORE then a few extra notches; But unlike \\"Cape Fear\\", I don't feel he succeeded THIS time around.    The movie is \\"Popcorn\\" okay and watchable, and it's NO surprise why it was a such a huge box-office hit. But ironically, the twists and turns of the adapted screenplay (I haven't read the novel), most especially the twist at the end, is MUCH closer to the now too-familiar style of M. Night Shyamalan, rather than Hitchcock, which stunts it's ability to be anything MORE than what it COULD HAVE been, even FROM a gifted filmmaker such as Scorsese.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|The Fourth season of Dexter is absolutely mind-blowing! Trinity, the new adversary, is such a complex character like Dexter. Without ruining what happens for those who haven't seen it yet, this season is better than 1-3. It leaves you hanging and wanting more. ESPECIALLY the ending. It's a definite watch!
0307474712|4.0|So what do we gain from this heartbreaking story? Love conquers all and be glad we sometimes get a glimpse of it? Or is it that we can endure anything and with time we learn to move on and overcome? Yes this book is engaging, it's frustrating at times and you always expect something out of the ordinary to happen..however not like it did though. I was a bit disappointed at the end, but the author tied it together well enough not to leave me feeling so empty. It's worth the read. Kind of like life, the bad times make the good times that much better.
0307454541|1.0|Suckered into reading this first installment of a trilogy by incessant media attention, my expectations were high, I admit.  The first third of the book is rather slow and uneventful.  Speed picks up during the gripping middle of the book.  In the final third of the book the true story of crime is revealed, with gratuitous amounts of unspeakable violence against women and animals that are revolting.  What follows is a quick succession of implausibles:  the unlikely rescue, the long-winded revenge wind-up, and the ridiculous great heist side-show mess up an admittedly well crafted piece of entertainment writing.  Not worth putting these images into ones head.
B0043EV774|2.0|Wasn't impressed at all with the 3d.  At times the convergence is way off.  Things in the foreground will have ghosting (this can be seen when paused so it's no the speed of the TV) while things in the center of the screen will be perfectly aligned.  While at times there is good depth in the image it seemed like the 3D was hit or miss and depending on the scene you either had an excellent image or a crappy one.      Everything else I've seen in 3d at home has been excellent (AVATAR, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Resident Evil).
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Back in 1992, I believe it was, \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" starring Daniel Day-Lewis was released to a blockbuster reception by the public. It was exciting, well acted and beautiful. However, it was not a trans-literation (word for word) of the source novel by James Fenimore Cooper - far from it. Like many films that have novels as their story origin, you must endeavor to take the film on its own merits and not bemoan that what you loved in the book was not on the screen as you hoped. You can love both, one, or neither, but don't hate the one for being unlike the other.    This is the problem many early critical reviewers of \\"Let Me In\\" seemed to fall into. They had loved the original Swedish book and film (\\"Let the Right One In\\"), but didn't like this American version because the tone and focus is slightly different. (An example would be Reeves' decision to make nearly all characters in the film outside the primaries into archetypes, not only simplifying the narrative, but also reenforcing Owen's isolation - a brilliant choice.) Many critics said things like it's \\"a needless remake\\" or \\"not as faithful as the original\\" or some such. The damaging thing is that Matt Reeves' beautiful film was not taken on its own terms and therefore was not given a chance by some of the very audience it was made for.    \\"Let Me In\\" is beautiful, haunting, disturbing, painfully human and engrossing. The pace is deliberate, but spot-on. This was not made for the slasher film crowd. This is a movie that dares you to think what would life be like for a vampire and those around them. It works as a morality tale about, effectively, a serial killer. It also is the story about adolescence and the horrible pain of that age and the joy of finding a kindred spirit.    What is disturbing is the questions that arise from the relationships in the film. Who needs who, for what reasons, and where does the line between 'love' and 'need' end and the other begin?    The two leads in this film are stunning. No other word will suffice for their performances. They are brilliant and carry the film with their facial expressions. Moretz and Smit-McPhee deserve high praise for their work. Utterly amazing. (Compliments to the secondary players, Jenkins and Koteas, for excellent work as well.)    One final thought, a great film is enhanced by a great musical score. Like \\"Mohicans\\", the music in \\"Let Me In\\" soars and makes this film an indispensible one.    See \\"Let Me In\\" for all the right reasons. If you are a lover of film, this is a can't miss.
B00275EGX8|2.0|The movie as a whole is not very impressive.       I found this movie quite boring.  The story was simple.  The major actors did not attract the attention of the audience.     The extraction of a bomb from inside the body of a kid was disturbing but the set up of the scene does not look like real.

B003ZK58WM|5.0|The entire 20th century, as well as the beginning of the 21st century, has its roots in the events leading up to World War I. Many of us in the baby boomer generation remember grandparents, parents, teachers, and neighbors who served in both world wars. Ken Follett's ability to show us the evolution of the events that have shaped our lives through the eyes of ordinary and highly placed people is uncanny and makes us feel as though we are there. I recall stories from my grandfather (World War 1) and father (World War II) from these periods, and Fall of Giants lends more depth to my understanding. I look forward to the next 2 installments of the trilogy. I have never read a 1000 page book so quickly!
0312600844|4.0|This tome has chewed me up and spit me out. Never have I taken a book so personally. It is the definitive snapshot of my generation of \\"Dazed & Confused\\" teens, who morphed into helicopter parents, and subsequently spawned a \\"Facebooked\\" generation of children.<br /><br />It took me 3 months of starts and fits, but I finished all 600 pps., despite loathing most of the characters, with the exception of Dorothy and Connie. That said, Franzen has a way with words i.e. \\"whiskey sunburn,\\" and can the man put together a sentence? That would be an understatement; he is a master at utilizing the English language in ways that make you pause. Get a fresh highlighter for this read.<br /><br />I have a hunch this is a future classic, but frankly it's depressing in all the ways the 21st c. is depressing, wars, recessions, environmental disasters, betrayals, not to mention the duplicity of our leaders. To bastardize Dickens...\\"It was the worst of times. It was the worst of times.\\" If you're a vertical, sentient being, and read the daily headlines, you probably suspect as much. However if you are a mashochist and crave a double espresso dosage of daily depression, and/or a writer attempting to ply your art in an era of Clive Cusslers, I recommend you pick up this book. Otherwise, let the dust settle on your ravaged psyche and buy this future masterpiece 3 years hence at your local public library used book sale.

B0015DROBO|5.0|Had to send in a review when I saw this book receving less than 4 stars.  It is great (once you get past the first 50 pages or so), and everyone I know that had read it has liked it too.

B004G6009K|4.0|I saw Tangled in 2D and I really enjoyed it.  It had a lot of comedy and the music (composed by Alan Menken from Aladdin and other classic Disney movies) was pretty good.  I do want to warn that the story could basically be summed up as a mixture of Aladdin and Snow White with a new twist of Rapunzel.  Though this may not be obvious, I'll explain how I came to this (Spoilers Below):  A thief named Flynn Rider plunders inside the kingdom.  As he escapes the guards (and their horses, one of which his is main foe Maximus) he encounters a princess named Rapunzel.  Rapunzel has magical abilities (when she sings her hair glows and has healing properties) and was kidnapped when she was a baby for them and locked in a tower in a hidden valley.  She is cared for by her kidnapper (Mother Gothel), who she thinks is her mother, but wants to explore the world.  She blackmails Flynn into being her guide and, as they see the sights, they slowly grow to care for each other.  They also befriend Maximus along the way  Meanwhile, Mother Gothel finds out Rapunzel has escaped and enlists Flynn's ex-partners whom Flynn had betrayed to help her.  They track Rapunzel and Flynn down, turn Flynn over to the guards and Mother Gothel knocks out Flynn's partners and returns Rapunzel, who now thinks Flynn betrayed her, to the tower.  As Flynn is being led to the gallows, he realizes Rapunzel is in danger and escapes with the help of Maximus.  Rapunzel realizes she is the princess and is chained up by Mother Gothel.  Flynn arrives and, just as he sees that Rapunzel is chained, gets stabbed by Mother Gothel.  Rapunzel promises to obey Mother Gothel if she can save Flynn, but before she can, Flynn cuts off her hair (thereby removing its magical traits) and Mother Gothel falls out the window as she turns to dust.  As Rapunzel crys over Flynn's body, a magical tear falls on him and heals him, restoring his life.  They return to the palace, Rapunzel is reunited with her family and she marries Flynn.So the part about a thief stealing from the palace and meeting the princess and falling in love with her is reminiscent of Aladdin (not to mention that Flynn kind of looks like Aladdin as well).  The princess being sent away where noone can find her is from Snow White.  Also, the villain falling to her death and a main character being revived from death by their lover is from Snow White as well.  I know I sound very critical of the movie, but I do want to say I thought it was very good and kept me engaged throughout.  The seen where Rapunzel gets to see the hundreds of floating lanterns that are released on her birthday every year with the hop that she will see them and return was very magical and was a fabulous scene.  Plus, I thought the voice talents of Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi worked very well for Rapunzel and Flynn.  I also want to say that I would not have seen Tangled if I did not think it was going to be good, so I am really just nitpicking at the parts I thought had been borrowed from other movies.  Overall, Tangled was very good and I recommend to everyone who has enjoyed the animated Disney movies of the past.

B002YIHO7I|5.0|I was never really a fan of Sade until I heard this album.  I heard the \\"Soldier of Love\\" single, and it caught my attention.  It was so different than everything else being played on the radio.  So I decided to purchase the album, and I was blown away.    This album comes from such an honest place.  Music today is often created by the artist, and then filtered through a record company before it reaches us.  You can tell that this is not the case with Sade.  This is music that will touch your soul.  Life is pretty much madness right now.  But I throw this cd on in the car, and it instantly puts me in a different space.       I love all the songs off of this album.  You can listen to the samples, and see why.  This album has made me a fan.  I have been exploring the rest of her albums, and all are equally as great.   Sade is timeless.  I cannot wait to see the band live this Summer!  Give this cd a chance!

B003EY7IRC|2.0|OK, I'm not sure what book all the 5 star reviews are talking about, because for me, this book was pure torture.  I read it on my Kindle, and at one point, I looked to see if I was almost finished, and I was only at 23%.  That was when I said \\"K'Vruck this\\", and I skimmed (and I mean QUICKLY skimmed) the remaining 77%.  I don't feel I missed anything either.      The never ending and laborious details (that weren't important to the story), the (others are calling it introspection) what I am calling MACwhining...OMGoodness.  Someone stick her with the spear....PLEASE!!    I have been a HUGE KMM fan since I picked up her first Highland book, and can devour one of her books in 6-8 hours. But this book took 9 days of my life that I will never get back.  Seriously, if I could call on the power of the Sinsar Dubh and unmake this book, I would!    Yes, there were some questions answered, which is the only reason I gave it an extra star.  But the confusion in getting to where the answers were was not worth the effort.  Sorry.
B004HUAYMS|5.0|This is a great record.  For those who can't stand it when an artist matures and changes and writes about different topics or topics from a more mature perspective don't understand the concept of art and the artist.  If you want to hear the Social D of the 1980s then go listen to their earlier works.  If you're ready for something new - to see the world from the artist's perspective at this point in time, then buy this album.  Mike has grown and matured and has a family of his own - the battles we fought yesterday on our own or with friends take on different importance, relevance and meaning in hindsight.  We find new battles to fight for our families - maybe we even understand things we struggled with when we were younger, for lack of wisdom or experience.  This is a fantastic record and I haven't been able to stop listening to it.  There is a sadness and honesty in the lyrics and music.      Those that bemoan the fact this band is very different today from 20 or even 30 years ago, I say \\"good.\\"  I wouldn't want to listen to the same thing re-hashed 30 years later.  The change is evidence that Mike has been living his life, and I say good on him for being courageous enough to do so!
B004CLYKLI|1.0|I don't understand how this book was published.  I was raised by a Western family and was encouraged to do my best and was always reminded everyday to go for what I really wanted to do for myself.  I read this book out of curiousity and I was surprised that child protective services didn't step in.  Withholding rest, bathroom breaks, and food is considered child abuse and/or neglect. And then it comes out that the author's husband was raised by Western parents and is now a Yale law professor. Obviously he wasn't messed up by a Western family.

Born in Hong Kong and having moved in N America at 6, I found this book to be very amusing.  I, too, remembered asking my parents why what I did wasn't enough for them.  But as an adult, and in retrospect, I am grateful for the values and discipline that they instilled in me.  Pushing a child to play piano does not necessarily mean that you, as a parent, want them to be a concert pianist -- to me, what it means is that you are teaching them that hard work pays off, and hopefully that carries over to other aspects of the child's life.    Nevertheless, a funny read - \\"What dreams/goals do you have for\\" (the dog)?

Despite knowing the outcome of the races, this film still had me on the edge of my seat.  Beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted.  A pure joy to behold.  Kudos to Disney for bringing Secretariat's greatness to younger generations.

I currently have it hanging up al over my room. the Kanye poster is larger than what is shown in the pictures since the Runaway art that is shows is on the back side of the Kanye poster. Only thing that I dislike is that the images are blurred on the vinyl aas well as the little gold poster. I know it shows this in the description, but figured it was just for the description only. Little bit upset but not a reason to give it less than 5 stars since it was partially my fault!

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I look down on Dan Brown. The plot line of the Davinci Code - that Jesus shacked up with Mary Magdalene - created such a furor... and it was based on bull. Imagination is great when you're talking about fiction novels but when you take a look at his Facebook page you will see people believe what he writes as fact.<br /><br />Sometimes a book is just entertaining... it doesn't have to be based on something real to enjoy it!<br /><br />The Lost Symbol was interesting and fast paced. The story revolves around a disturbed and over-tatooed gentleman called Mal'akh. Mal'ack is to esotericism as Jerry Falwell is to evangelicalism - which is to say out of his freaking mind. Part tour of Washington D.C. landmarks and part introduction to esotericism the novel is satisfying.<br /><br />He covers topics like Masonic rituals, the Ancient Mystery religions, human sacrifices, and history as if they go together like a fat man and McDonalds. Unlike the Davinci Code most of what he says is based on fact - he describes existing Masonic rituals and exposes the alternative religion held by most of America's founders.<br /><br />I can see for many the information in the Lost Symbol would be groundbreaking. Don't expect a full expose of Masonry though. I would recommend this book as a lazy way to learn about topics that are rarely brought out beyond the people involved in them.<br /><br />He handled them well.<br /><br />However, The Lost Symbol isn't perfect.  Not only is Dan Brown trying to introduce you to another, often hidden, religion but he becomes its cheerleader! Near the end the Lost Symbol becomes a blatant propaganda piece for esotericism.  Hell he's practically begging you to read the Bible from a mystical point of view.<br /><br />The effect was weird and out of place. It just comes out of left field.<br /><br />If your looking to waste some time on a quick read then the Lost Symbol is a good buy. But please... remember its only fiction people.<br /><br />Rating (gouge my eyes out, below average, average, above average, more please)<br /><br />Above Average<br /><br />Enjoyed: Very interesting, page turner, exposes things not normally discussed in the open, excellent history of Washington landmarks<br /><br />Disliked: A propaganda piece of esotericism, forces weird beliefs on its readers, tries to be grand when it shouldn't beerage    Enjoyed: Very interesting, page turner, exposes things not normally discussed in the open, excellent history of Washington landmarks    Disliked: A propaganda piece of esotericism, forces weird beliefs on its readers, tries to be grand when it shouldn't be
B0041KKYEM|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Who knew? Rather than a profession peopled with a crew of dedicated professionals, the ballet world, according to director Darren Aronofsky, really consists of a bunch of back-stabbing bitches, self-mutilating neurotics, sleazy artistic directors and a 'Stage Mom' from hell.<br /><br />Black Swan has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in this one-note tale of a dancer's quest to come out on top as she pursues the lead role in Swan Lake for a prominent (unnamed) NYC ballet company. The film is really supposed to be a cautionary tale about people who will stop at nothing to further their careers. Ironically, Natalie Portman (as the protagonist, Nina Sayers) worked herself out like a dog in order to replicate the look of a full-time ballet dancer; many internet posters have commented how unhealthy she looks on screen and seems to be just as guilty as the character she plays (where Nina will stop at nothing to become the so-called 'Swan Queen', Ms. Portman has worked herself to the bone in the quest for Oscar Gold!).<br /><br />Vincent Cassell plays the sleazy artistic director of the company, Thomas Leroy. Leroy has no qualms about throwing the over-the-hill principal dancer, Beth Macintrye (played by a way over the top Winona Ryder) under the bus after deciding that the younger Nina must now carry the torch. His decision is not immediate as he has reservations about whether Nina can actually play the darker 'Black Swan' part. He senses that things aren't right with Nina as she is unable to 'let herself go'. The consummate professional that he is, Leroy instructs Nina to go home and masturbate which will help her to get in touch with her more spontaneous self. When he gives her pointers on the dance floor, he says things like, \\"Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me!\\" Nina finally gets the role when Leroy tests her by attempting to kiss her while they're alone--in response, Nina bites him on the lip (that proves to Leroy, believe it or not, that Nina has what it takes!).<br /><br />Also in the mix is Nina's pushy mother, Erica, who she lives with in a small, unattractive apartment. The mother wanted to be a ballet dancer but never made it and ended up pushing Nina to become the driven artiste she has become. It's clear that Erica is unconsciously jealous of her daughter's success but I can't agree with others who have suggested there is an incestuous sub-text here. If anything, Nina's mother is extremely upset over the evidence that Nina has been self-mutilating and is now trying to get her to slow down and take care of herself.<br /><br />Finally, there's Lily, Nina's rival from San Francisco who Leroy names as alternate in the Swan Lake production. Lily sports a bunch of tattoos and has a mouth like one of the performers you might find on 'Jersey Shore'. Nina hallucinates having a steamy sexual encounter with Lily but soon finds out that it was all in her mind.<br /><br />Throughout 'Black Swan', Nina keeps imagining seeing her double which unnerves her no end. Aronofsky deceptively leads us to believe that Nina harbors murderous impulses. Prior to the climax, Nina fights with her double who morphs into Lily. It then appears that Nina stabs Lily to death just prior to the opening night performance. But during intermission, Lily knocks on Nina's dressing room door making it quite clear that Lily's murder was just another one of Nina's hallucinations. It turns out that Lily is not a murderer at all--rather, the murderous impulses were simply a reflection of Nina's own self-hatred. She ends up stabbing herself prior to going back out for the second act and presumably is found bleeding to death as the curtain descends and the oblivious audience roars their approval.<br /><br />Nina's last words regarding her performance was that \\"it was perfect\\". The irony of course is that although achieving her goal of mastering the role of the 'Black Swan', she sacrificesher life. In real life, those who give up a piece of themselves for their ambition, don't usually kill themselves. Rather, they end up with a feeling of a self-satisfaction and achievement of their goals. It's of course for others to judge them whether their rise to the top was conducted with a modicum of moral integrity.<br /><br />In the end, there are few surprises here as Nina's self-destructive internal arc is played out as if someone kept hitting the repeat button on a video monitor. All those scratch marks and peeling toenails become tedious after awhile and the potential tempting plot that Nina's actions might lead to a murder investigation turns out to be nothing more than a big tease on the part of director Aronofsky.<br /><br />Some may feel that Nina is the epitome of a tragic heroine--she accomplishes her goal of mastering a difficult dramatic part but throws away her life at the same time. If you are going to have a heroine who is self-destructive, why not model your character on Tennessee Wiliam's Blanche Dubois? Her back story is a real one as opposed to the one-note Nina, molded by a stereotyped Stage Mother from hell.<br /><br />The frenetic pacing of the Black Swan narrative will hold your interest to the end but the ride is decisively creepy. Has Aronofsky created a true cautionary tale on the dangers of careerism? Or does he revel in the excesses that he is supposedly criticizing? Somehow, all the gory goings on in The Black Swan don't seem to be a very appropriate venue for the dignified world of ballet. Better to catch a young Mickey Rourke in 'Angel Heart' if you desire a blood-fest that's a tad bit more creative.mselves for their ambition, don't usually kill themselves.

You might feel guilty for being a human after watching this but I think it makes a good gift especially for the younger generation.

B002AS463W|1.0|From everything I have experienced, read, all the way to simply heard has made it quite clear that alternative sexual relationships are based on CONSENT. While Elizabeth consented to the initial relationship with John, and some acts performed after, what I mostly saw was this woman basically backing down after the fact. Does this negate Elizabeth's responsibility in this relationship ? Hardly... But it also does not dismiss the fact that this affair was far more about manipulation, than any intelligent erotica, or healthy human feelings. The most erotic moment in the movie was when Elizabeth was by herself looking at art. The character John went straight for Elizabeth with the obvious base methods of his wallet, ( and yes... She ate that hook with relish ), and the hidden dream of most females to be catered, and pampered to. ( In other words, to be spoiled ) Not exactly aspiring to our higher natures, these things should have been the first indication that John didn't hold women in any decent regard other then that they were playthings. This film is beautifully filmed, and the characters are very human. The most distressing thing I found about this film though is they were not particularly \\"healthy\\" human beings, and certainly brought no positive qualities to this lifestyle.
B001NLKT60|2.0|This author seems to have run out of steam after his first book. If I was reading this on a plane, I think I would scream. The writing style is painfully tedious. There is far too much minute detail and sidetracks that are frustrating diversions from the main story. Sometimes it seems as if I am reading a screenplay with demanding emphasis on the setting rather than the story. It is almost as if the author is bragging about how much research he did into the sex trade industry, or the organization of certain Swedish government agencies. I realize that this English trilogy  is a translation from Swedish, and I have no idea how much style is lost in translation. I kept feeling that the book was a collection of chapters printed in monthly magazines over a period of time. The fact that all three books were submitted right before the writer's demise suggests that it might have been his family who decided to publish works they found among his possessions. It certainly seemed that these books could use some serious editing so they would get to the point sooner. Instead of a Who Done It, it often seemed a Why Done It.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|When it was announced that director David Fincher's latest project was about Facebook, I was taken aback. As the film approached its release date, I became even more astounded at how critically acclaimed it was. The Social Network received nearly universal acclaim, has been called \\"the movie of our generation,\\" and has been compared to Citizen Kane. It has also won nearly every award it's been nominated for and it's a safe bet that the film will take home Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film succeeds because it isn't just about Facebook, but instead uses the tremendously popular social networking site as a backdrop for the action. Writer Aaron Sorkin explores themes in his screenplay that elevate the material far beyond what a simple \\"Facebook movie\\" would be.    The film begins with Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a Harvard student and his girlfriend Erika (Rooney Mara) discussing Mark's obsession with getting into a Final Club. By the end of this brilliantly staged opening scene, Erika breaks up with Mark because he's \\"an a**hole.\\" Intoxicated, Mark returns to his dorm room and begins blogging about Erika while creating a website that compares two female college students and allows users to pick the one they find more attractive. This site crashes Harvard's network, which impresses twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Armie Hammer) and their business partner Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) enough to approach Mark to help them create a social networking site called The Harvard Connection. This meeting inspires Mark to create The Facebook, a social networking site that \\"puts the entire social experience of college online.\\" Bringing in his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) as CFO, the film follows Mark as his idea grows larger than any of them could have imagined. While this is taking the place, the film cuts between Mark's depositions in two lawsuits: one filed by the Winklevoss twins and one by his best friend Eduardo Saverin. The architecture of the script is brilliant, cutting between many different storylines and perspectives but never growing confusing or collapsing under the weight of its own ambitions.      The entire cast is made up of young actors, some of whom you may have seen before but none that have really made their mark until the release of this film. Jesse Eisenberg puts the rumor that he's nothing more than a diet-Michael Cera to bed with his performance. Playing a real person is difficult, but playing a real person who is not only still alive but only a few years removed from his age at the time you're playing him brings a whole different level of difficulty. It's been said that this film makes Zuckerberg look bad yet Eisenberg makes him a highly intelligent, driven individual whose obsession with creating the ultimate social networking experience alienated him from those around him. Zuckerberg, as portrayed in the film, is sarcastic and ruthless but Eisenberg makes him ultimately sympathetic. Getting an audience to care about a man who seemingly screwed a lot of people including his best friend to become the world's youngest billionaire is a very daunting task and Eisenberg creates a convincing, three-dimensional human being.    Garfield has received the most notice and accolades for his performance as Eduardo Saverin and his vulnerable, likeable performance is a brilliant contrast to Eisenberg's performance. Garfield does a splendid job but I was much more impressed by two other performances:    Superstar Justin Timberlake portrays Napster-founder Sean Parker, who discovered Zuckerberg's Facebook once it expanded to Stanford. I've seen Timberlake in a couple films previously, where he established himself as a good actor. It's this performance where he not only establishes himself as a serious actor, but a star. Timberlake plays Parker as an intelligent, charming, and manipulative businessman who has all the connections and answers that Zuckerberg lacks.Out of the supporting cast, Timberlake made the biggest impression with me. He gives a mature, focused performance that is both convincing and fascinating. With that said, it is Armie Hammer who is the unsung hero of the cast. Hammer and Josh Pence both play the Winklevoss twins, but special effects allow Hammer's face to digitally replace Pence's to portray the two. This is the same method that Fincher used in his previous film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button to allow Brad Pitt to age backwards and it's used flawlessly here. After seeing the film the first time I was shocked that the Winklevoss twins were not played by a real set of twin brothers. Hammer creates two identical twins that one can easily tell apart, but it's the remarkable screen presence he brings to the role that I found really impressive. One doesn't see a performance like this anymore. He captures the perfect amount of upper-class arrogance and respectability, being both fascinating and hilarious. Hammer has a certain quality as an actor that makes him seem to be a movie star from a forgotten era. This is an actor who has the potential to do great things.    The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross seems to have people drawn about whether it's great or intrusive, but I find it to be one of the most memorable scores I've heard in some time. It's a pulsating, unconventional score that has little time for subtlety. A lot of great film score's serve as background noise or as a way of heightening the intensity of certain scenes. This score alternates between pulsating and quietly sinister, but it somehow works for every scene and compliments the overall tone of the film perfectly. It may not be your typical film score, but it's a great one that shows Reznor could have a serious impact on film music.    This is a very energetic film that moves at a lightning quick speed. The script is a masterwork of plotting and dialogue leaving Sorkin no chance of leaving the Oscar ceremony without an award forhis work. When a film is essentially two hours of dialogue, yet is widely accepted by a major audience with no big action sequences or a sappy romance, the writer has done something correctly. The dialogue is both intelligent and clever and the script has a surprising amount of humor, including some very quotable one-liners that don't seem forced or unnecessary. It's one of the few films I've seen recently that I was so engrossed by, I found myself not wanting it to end. Even coming in at the 2-hour mark The Social Network seems to conclude too quickly, yet it doesn't feel rushed. It's a brilliant marriage of writing and directing. Fincher proved his visual flair with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but that film suffered from a weak script and obvious symbolism. While it initially seems out of place, the Winklevoss' rowing scene is extremely well-directed and well-structured, while its look and choice of music reminded me of something Kubrick would have directed.    Comparisons to Citizen Kane are not without merit as both films use similar sources of information (Kane used newspapers, TSN uses the internet) as a backdrop and similarly driven individuals as a main character. Furthermore, both films explore similar themes. Not wanting to be out-done, other critics have said this film defines our generation. After my first viewing, I thought it was a great film but I questioned whether it would have longevity. If this film had been made 3 years ago and had been about myspace, would it be relevant today? The more I think about it, the more I feel this film will enjoy longevity because of how Sorkin and Fincher avoided making a \\"Facebook movie.\\" The film has timeless themes of friendship, betrayal, loyalty, and social interaction that I believe will allow it to be remembered and appreciated for years to come. Does this film define a generation? That I cannot say. It may not define this generation, but it does define the social climate right now. If it's not remembered as a defining film of this generation, it will serve as a time capsule of how people interacted with each other at this moment. The Social Network is a complex, marvelous film; never boring, remarkably well-made, and one of the best films of 2010.    GRADE: A    *As for the packaging and presentation, Sony did a miraculous job with it. The bonus features are very in-depth and the packaging is some of the best I've seen from a major studio. Instead of using that cheap cardboard, they've opted for a really nice material that looks and feels great. This release is truly (dare I say it?) Criterion worthy.

0385341679|5.0|If I had to use one word to describe Shadowfever I would have to say EPIC. This series is all in a epic category of it's own. I can honestly say that it was worth the wait, all the speculating and predicting from the hell-ish cliffhanger in Dreamfever was well worth it. Shadowfever captivated me in a way no book has ever done so before.<br /><br />Shadowfever was mind-blowing and heart-wrenching. At the end of Dreamfever Mac had killed someone very dear to her and we finally find out who that is. It comes as a big surprise as to who that very special someone was because I kept thinking no, it must be someone else. Chapter 1 o Shadowfever was breathtaking for me because the way that Karen Marie Moning writes is just so astonishing. The chapter killed me. There is so much emotion in how Mac in feeling learning who she has killed that it tears me apart. I was seriously tearing up here. Moning writing is spectacular.<br /><br />Mackayla Lane She goes through hell. I am really impressed with Mac that I can't even begin to describe it. For a young woman to go through what she has grown through has to have a heart of a true warrior and she has proved again and again that that is what she is, brave, and tough. She could conquer the world if she wanted to. Mac has become one of my all-time favorite heroines.<br /><br />Jericho Barrons Oh, god this man makes me swoon! Sometimes you want to hate him for being so cold, but than again that sexy voice and body, I want him! We finally get something, we finally get a little clue on what Barrons is and it makes perfect sense why didn't I think of that. We get to see into Barrons head a little bit and know a little bit what he is thinking and what secrets he has held from Mac. And another thing, why he wants the Sinsar Dubh. He is the most perfect dangerous bad-boy that you will get and he has taken my heart. I declare that Jericho Barrons has become my favorite guy in an urban fantasy series or of all-time. I have the Barrons Fever and I don't want a cure!<br /><br />Darroc aka. LM We have gotten plenty of Darroc and I admit, I have to admit, don't hate me til you have read Shadowfever, don't hate me even then.) I have grown to like Darroc, I didn't even think this has happened. We get a little inside look into him and into how his relationship with Mac's sister, Alina really was and I have to say that he could have been a changed man, not the total crazy dude we all thought him to be. hmmmm..<br /><br />V'lane All I have to say is OMFG!!! I so didn't see that coming.<br /><br />My Lovely Mackeltars I love them all! I want more highlander book! Even though they had a role in the book, I wanted more. But at least we got some yummy Christian! I want more Christian. Drustan and Dageus made my heart flutter so I had no doubt in my mind that Christian would too. It is surprising what new change happened in Christian.<br /><br />This whole entire series has consumed me. Every single book in this series was an addiction that I didn't want to get away from. It was amazing. We had twist and turns and cliffhangers that drove me insane, but let me tell you those cliffhangers were worth it to get to this moment, to get to Shadowfever and find everything out, all the secrets that Moning has kept from us for 5 years. It was so worth it.<br /><br />It is sad for a series to come to an end. I want more. I enjoyed Mac's journey and will forever love this series. I loved every single one of these characters and YES!

1400052173|5.0|This book is amazing, and deserves every bit of the praise it has gotten in the reviews I've read.<br /><br />I am in awe of how well the author took a subject that was complicated in so many ways and wrote a book that was fair, balanced, moving, entertaining, and just a fantastic read. It made me think deeply about many subjects I'd never considered and care deeply about people I had never met.<br /><br />I had to keep reminding myself at times that this book was non-fiction. It was impeccably researched, and the author balanced so many things very well in her writing. She wrote without a hint of condescension about people from all walks of life. She wrote in exacting detail about complicated scientific subject matter, but made it accessible for a layperson to understand.<br /><br />Finally, she took a premise which was interesting on its own (the ethical considerations of Henrietta's story) but made the book about so much more - about family, and memory, things that expanded the story to a very universal one.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough!
B002BSHWUU|4.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He was very excited by it as he is a big Beatles fan.  He is still trying to find the concert that was supposed to be included.  Hasn't found it yet!!!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Word of advise - start this book only when you have time to finish it, I found it impossible to put down once I started! Much like the preceding book, this book has a somewhat slow start, but turns into a complete whirlwind very quickly. This is a lot more fast-paced than the Dragon Tattoo, I guess in part because the characters have mostly been introduced already, and because the plot here is more action packed. Lisbeth Salander's character has come out beautifully in this book and she sort of gets into your head - she's a mystery, she's unconventional, yet she comes across as very likable. The number of new characters introduced is fairly high, but I didn't find it difficult to keep track of who's who in the storyline. Credit is definitely deserved by Steig Larsson who has managed to keep a complex story gripping at all times, and there is no dull moment, no confusion of characters, and the overall flow is great. I am looking forward to finishing the trilogy, but plan to start the Hornet's Nest only when I have some free time!

B003ZY3050|5.0|I had to reorder this Item. @ first it was suposed to arrive in PR, however it never got there. It was a little hard to contact this seller the first time. Then I reorder to my address and it came as described.\\"
B002NULL9E|4.0|Being fairly new to listening to Queen I bought this CD because I wasn't sure what to expect.  After one hearing I was totally into it.  Amazed by the vocals and music arrangement, it was awesome and a great listen.  Now I will go ut and purchase the 2 disc set because by reading the reviews apparently I am missing out on the best songs.
B000IYV1ME|5.0|This movie requires you to be up on your geo-politics.  If you want to get the most out of this movie make sure check out the Wikipedia articles on the Tengiz Field and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I love this movie. It's really great for all ages. Very imaginative and the characters are amazing. This set is really cool because it comes with the bluray, regular DVD and the digital copy for your iPod or whatever. Definately worth the money.
B003Q6D1YW|4.0|Got a copy of this from a friend who didn't tell me a thing about it.  Hadn't seen the preview, which apparently was set up to make it look like Blair Witch and made a few people angry, because it's not like Blair Witch.  Well, it is in that it's a fake documentary.  Or maybe it's real.  Personally, I think it's fake.  Regardless, I think it's a good story and worth checking out, especially if you're on Facebook.    If nothing else, this movie will make you think about what you see online.  It's easy to be somebody you're not when you're hiding behind a computer screen.    If you decide to take a chance on this, stick it out.  The end is worth it.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I love Rachel Brice's Arms and Posture Dvd, and had to own this one too! I think it is a very good example of Rachel Brice's style of bellydance, and even if you enjoy more traditional and less fusion styles, the movements and control of body she teaches can be used for any style of dance. There is a slower and a faster dance, and there are live performances of each dance available on the dvd. She breaks down the movements and shows you how to put them all together. It isn't a dvd for a beginner, but if you have the basics down, it is a very nice dvd to have in your collection.
B003VIW8DK|4.0|I'm by no means a hardcore BF fan and have very little BF/Roxy in my collection. That said, I've liked what I've heard over the years, so when I stumbled into the hoopla over Ferry's latest release I decided to give it a try. I'm sure glad I did. For someone who mainly listens to electronic, industrial and rock music, I think Olympia is seriously good. So good in fact, that my favorite track keeps changing. It has that distinctive polished sound that all BF's records seem to have, the playing is fantastic and the coolness of it just oozes out the speakers. I was completely addicted to Heartache By Numbers for a while, but now I'm enchanted by Me Oh My. The backing vocal and arrangement on that track is to die for.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is a fine example of what BF does. For the casual fan looking for something recent to put in their collection, I'd say Olympia is well worth a listen. Enjoy a master at work!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|The true story of the last race horse to win the triple crown.  After losing a coin toss Penny Chenery (Lane), wins the horse Secretariat.  She hires a trainer (Malkovich) and a jockey and sets out to make history.  I was not that excited to watch this movie.  The extent of my horse racing knowledge begins and ends with \\"Seabiscuit\\" (which I did like).  I went in expecting to see Seabiscuit 2.  This was much better.  I do know the history of Secretariat being the last horse to win the triple crown, but not how or what a long shot he was.  This is a movie like Apollo 13 and Miracle, you know how it will end but you are still riveted and on the edge of your seat.  I'm sure there are people who know more about this story then I do and may find flaws with it.  I however really really liked it.  This is a true underdog story about two different aspects of racing, the horse and the owner.  A terriffic family film that you should not miss.  For the second week in a row...I give it an A+.<br /><br />Would I watch again - Yes, but may not have same effect 2nd time.
B003Y7L5W8|2.0|I'm sure there are better informed and more clued in OMD fans out there, but for me OMD's career seems to fall into 3 distinct phases. Phase 1 was the early classic years of moody, dark and somewhat experimental tunes found on their first (classic) album, the totally gorgeous Organisation and the sultry Architecture & Morality. Phase 2 was the 'erm...what are we doing?' period which produced some seriously strange stuff on records like Dazzle Ships and Junk Culture. Phase 3 was the 'we've lost it completely and now write poppy dance nonsense' as found on Pacific Age, Sugar Tax, Universal, etc. History of Modern is from phase 3 and I don't care for it.<br /><br />It's rare that I band I used to absolutely adore can produce something that I absolutely can't stand, but HoM is it. If, like me, you have played OMITD, Organisation and A&M to death over the years, you're going to be scratching your head when you hear the track \\"Sometimes\\". Seriosuly, what the heck is going on? Some tuneless dirge with a Macy Gray sound-a-like backing vocal. It's truly awful. I should have seen the writing on the wall when they made \\"Sister Mary Says\\" available as a free download from their website. It could easily have come from any of their phase 3 albums.<br /><br />So, bottom line is, if you loved the early OMD with all their Winston inspired quirkiness and sparse arrangements (think Bunker Soldiers, The Messerschmitt Twins, Statues, Beginning and the End) I don't think you'll find much on History of Modern to entertain you. A comeback wasted. Pity.
B004FEFZU2|4.0|Jigsaw (Bell) has one final trap set up for a survivor, can he survive again?  After Bobby Dagen (Flanery) becomes rich after writing a book chronicling his survival from Jigsaws traps he finds himself in another one.  This time with bigger implications.  When the police finally find out the truth can they get to him in time?  Let me start off by saying I am a fan of the Saw franchise, in spite of the gore factor.  Jigsaw has always reminded me a little of Hannibal Lector, a brutal serial killer, but there is a reason for what he does.  The first one is excellent due to the fact it changed the genre, but through the years it decided to remove the plot aspects and see how many people they can cut up in 90 minutes.  This one was not nearly as graphic as the other ones (ran out of ideas?) and only one scene made me squirm while watching.  It is a Saw movie so you pretty much know what your gonna get.  They did a really good job of tying up the series for a satisfying conclusion...but (no big shock) they left it open if they did decide to do another, like they did with the \\"final chapters\\" of \\"Friday the 13th\\", \\"Nightmare on Elm street\\", \\"Scream\\", \\"Final Destination\\", etc...  Overall I liked it, but again I have liked all of them.  I give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes, I would like to watch them all in order again to see how they all fit together.
0679731369|2.0|This is a book which some notable authors praise (Graham Greene and John Fowles for example) but I did not enjoy due to its constant references to the reader especially about writing. For example Barnes writes: \\"The imagination doesn't crop annually like a reliable fruit tree. The writer has to gather whatever's there: sometimes too much, sometimes too little, sometimes nothing at all.\\" The result was a smorgasbord of thoughts and ideas often bland and unpalatable. True, there were scattered within some wonderful snippets such as Barnes' rant about the late Dr Enid Starkie, Reader Emeritus in French Literature at the University of Oxford. It was when Barnes wrote about Flaubert's character and life that the novel picked up but when the narrator, Geoffrey Braithwaite, came to the fore, ennui set in. Barnes had obviously done considerable research into Flaubert's life but if you are looking for an enjoyable literary read, I suggest read Madame Bovary and leave Flaubert's Parrot on the shelf.
0375842209|5.0|It's been quite a while since I've posted a five star review and this novel earned all five.  Set during war torn Nazi Germany and narrated by Death through its many personas - omniscient, cruel, compassionate, reluctant, apathetic, resigned, cynical - \\"The Book Thief\\" depicts life in a small German town during the Holocaust.  Like Death, I am forever amazed by the beauty and compassion that can usually be found within the most wretched of human nature.  Sometimes you have to excavate it, as in the case of Rosa Huberman and Frau Holtzapfel; at other times it is a beacon, as with Hans Huberman, attracting those in need of its healing powers.  In its most distressing state, beauty and compassion lie dormant, as in the case of Alex Steiner, who knew that \\"somewhere, far down, there was an itch in his heart, but he made it a point not to scratch it.  He was afraid of what might come leaking out.\\"  The only aspect of human nature void of any compassion, gutted of beauty, is that of war.    I am equally amazed by the power and beauty of words, as evident in the creation of this text and central to rescue of its main character, Liesel Meminger.  In the hands of Zusak, words paint portraits on the landscape of world history and bring to life the experiences of people, the wreckage of war and the personification of death.  Off the lips of Liesel words soothed, provided hope and created a bond with Max that even war could not destroy.      Until my encounter with \\"The Book Thief\\", I could truthfully say that I've never known anyone - victim or hero - who has lived through or died from a war. Now, I feel as though I do.  Much kudos to Zusak for an incredible reading experience and many thinks to Frank J. for the recommendation.
0385512058|5.0|just finished lisening to this book. Excellent narration, a book I took heavy notes on (50 pages to be exact) Note: Reviews were 50/50 for this book. 'Name Dropping' was the culprit they say. But I counter with you can't hide you are from Harvard or rode in Airforce 1. It is how you tell the story, and he tells 'How he got there' this is a roadmap for others. So please relax on 'Name dropping' it was done on a tasteful level. What did I get from this Book. 1. I am single, and to get out and mingle I need social connections, real people, not match.com. This book tells how to make that human connection, what questions to ask, what approaches to take to meet connections, show warmth and get friends. Mid read through this book I did that. A note to a collegue to help a friend out who was laid off from her work. This book changed my mindset! 2. I am in the Corporate world, stuck, or so I thought, as I want to rise into managment. This book gives me the power plays (how to by pass secretaries to get to the CEO, or just be brave and e-mail ideas and go for it. Audicity = Success. This gives me methods to do this. 3. I am in Social Dynamics, interactions with people. I am confident, but that gets me talking to one person. This book opened my mind to needing to expand my connections, and how to do it. I did it mid read in this book. I e-mailed all my old friends for address and birthdays (key in this book) The replies I got back opened up old friendships with those I haven't seen in years. This isn't a facebook friend, this was connecting on a personal level. So buy this book, read it, it will valut you higher in your aspirations. One note, it is 5 years old, so the 'Social Media' concepts are dated. For the more current views on how to use social networks today in 2011, may I suggest the highly rated: The New Community Rules: Marketing on the Social Web Tamar Weinberg A very exciting book, a must read !
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Hachi is a wonderfully touching, true story of the bond between a man and his dog (love & loyalty like you've never seen.) Anyone who loves animals will want to experience this movie. I rented it first, then immediately had to own it.
1439152780|5.0|Greetings Eager Reader,    I highly recommend most of Morton's novels, especially her latest one, The Distant Hours.  Though this book follows some of her trademark patterns of having a twist at the end, Morton allows the reader to really fall through the pages into the time period following the thoughts and interactions of each character. If you want a read that will take you for a roller coaster ride while you keep in step with what life was like in the English WWII era, down to the smell and textile feel of the cold english nights were house lights had to be hidden, and butter had long been absent from the diet. I have read all of Morton's novels, and this is thus far my favorite! Enjoy!
0060922583|5.0|Me and the author have a lot in common, we both sought real wisdom of the cosmic reality our existence and all that is. We both are kind of Hoilist like psychics, beyond delusion of beliefs and perceptions.  Although I come to know what the book tells before buying the book for long while now, I was some what amaze in a sense that the author came to the same point where many had not yet come too. This book brings all knowledge that the mystics to complete clarity, as well it seems one day science will to reach this spiritual wisdom outside beliefs. Till them, this is the most complete and easy to understand book ever written so far I know of.    Mysticism and the New Physics is one of the early book the author has publish, and too comes to a more complete what many of us non-believers of spiritual wisdom seeking, and what science seems to be coming to of the well known coming into light.    The author kind of brings much into his books, expect in these two books does not talk about Tao wisdom. Which this would give more light to what is, undifferent from within. Other then that, well done!
0451209338|3.0|I'm still new to Daniel Silva's work. I've read his Osbourne series (The Mark of the Assassin, The Marching Season), and I consider them to be good, but not very great. The Kill Artist, the introduction to a new series featuring Gabriel Allon, was released back in 2000, and it dealt with bitter conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians. Allon has long retired from Israeli secret service, and is now living the life of an art restorer. Tariq, a Palestinian criminal mastermind who killed Allon's wife and child years ago, is on the loose yet again. Allon has been called back into the secret service, and what follows is a worldwide manhunt, ranging from France to Quebec.<br /><br />With the few flaws that I've found in the previous two novels, I would have expected Silva to ramp it up a bit with The Kill Artist. Instead, I found this book to be very average, several notches below Mark of the Assassin. The story was all over the place in the first act: so many subplots crumpled together that it was sometimes hard to keep track of the actual story. There were a few plot points that really went nowhere (such as the one involving the character Peel), while political thriller cliches had been found here and there. I've also spotted a couple of implausible plot threads/twists here and there; one of them came out of nowhere and it left me unconvinced. I shouldn't exclude the several moments of REALLY bland dialogue (some of which sounded way too simplistic even for characters such as Allon and Ari Shamron). And to make it even worse, the ending felt very mediocre: nothing stood out of it, and it felt extremely anticlimactic.<br /><br />The Kill Artist should have been edited more carefully. There is some good political intrigue, Gabriel and Jacqueline share an interesting relationship, and Tariq & Yusef are not seen as cardboard cutout bad guys. Unfortunately, the many flaws in the story and character development have kept me from giving this book at least a 6 out of 10. My final grade is 4.9 out of 10. I really hope that the next installment, The English Assassin, is much better than the first.<br /><br />Grade: 4.9/10<br /><br />Also from Daniel Silva<br />The Mark of the Assassin (7.4/10): [[ASIN:0451209311 The Mark of the Assassin]]<br />The Marching Season (7.7/10): [[ASIN:045120932X The Marching Season]]9 out of 10.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|Great flick.  I totally enjoyed it.  Wish BB had the BD version when we rented.  The soundtrack is great.  Now I want to read the book.  Still don't understand how FB makes money and how it could possibly be worth $25B.  The lead actor in the flick does an excellent job.  There are a couple of quotes in the film that bear reflecting on.  One is, \\"fashion is never finished.\\"  The other I cannot remember exactly but goes something like, \\"been to a Tower Records lately?\\"  The Napster guy and iTunes killed the CD and kicked the the music industry in the crotch doing it.  I don't get FB but that is because I am 50+ years old but I did get this movie.  Highly recommended.
0316017922|4.0|I found Malcolm Gladwell's presentation of the subject of success fascinating! He incorporated a lot of interesting research to back up his arguments about why successful people are successful. I recommend this book to anyone interested in stretching their minds past commonly held beliefs.  I still maintain, however, that regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, success isn't given even if you're offered an opportunity - you've got to take that opportunity and that's what makes successful people successful. Others have been offered opportunities, but they don't go for it.  Also I would have like to have seen more stories about female success stories.  Christine Brown-Quinn, The Female Capitalist(TM), Author of Step Aside Super Woman...Career & Family is for Any Woman.
B002ZG9940|3.0|Not the action thriller you would suppose it to be.  Very slow, plodding kind of movie.  Lots of technical and plot problems for me.  Yet, I still kinda liked it.  I never really figured out who or what he was, assassin, terrorist, murderer, weapons dealer?  Wife almost gave up on this one twice and in the end she said it was awful.  More of a psycho thriller maybe.  The whole movie is plot and character development I guess.  Would not watch again but it filled a couple of hours on a cold day.
B004G6009K|5.0|Honestly, It could have been better, but the fact of the matter is that all the little girls loved it! My two girls and my niece's fell in love with it. Disney movies are for the whole family but at the end of the day if the kids like it, parents guess what you're buying all the movies, toys and clothes your kiddies can lay their sweet little eyes on...I loved it, it was such a sweet movie. Can't wait till the release date, Miss Abby and Naty can't wait either!
0316067938|5.0|i loved the book. i have read over it 2 times and it is perfect in my eyes. i wish she would write one more book to go on and see what happens next.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I really like Amy Farrah Fowler's character. She is the female Sheldon and come on..Sheldon needs love 2!!!.  I like these 2 together!!.
B000063V8S|5.0|I loved it. Especially The Q-Pid episode. John De Lancie is great. EVerytime Q shows up anywhere on any of the shows the episodes are hilarious. I also enjoyed episodes with Loxanna(spelling?) Troi, Majel Barrett is very entertaining to watch as she messes with Jean Luc in some way in every episode she shows up in. In season 4 its interesting to also see/meet some of the family members of some more of the crew.
B001UV4XWY|4.0|What would you do? This proves to be a really entertaining movie on many levels. Just the premise alone makes for a good dinner conversation piece in itself.     Filled with mystery, suspense, action, and ultimately serious drama, what more could you want? Set in the seventies in the safe, sleepy suburbs the era and surroundings all add to the tension. Beneath the surface, lies a supernatural element which creates some striking imagery and forces the viewer to look further. The movie deserves a couple of viewings to fully comprehend because not everything is explained, which is part of the fun.     The special effects for the creepy Mr Arlington Stewart's signature scar (played by Frank Langella) is a sight to see and very well done. The Special features share some info on this which is also worth checking out. If you enjoyed DONNIE DARKO, LOST HIGHWAY and M Night Shyamalan's earlier films, you will like this. Original and entertaining.
B0049OSQ18|4.0|On their latest album, Colin Meloy and his merry band of Decemberists have abandoned the complexities of their previous efforts (The Crane Wife and The Hazards of Love) in favor of a more straight forward, rootsy approach.  But don't let the new simpler sound of this record fool you.  The King is Dead is full of gorgeous melodies, excellent musicianshiip and the typically smart and poetic lyrics that fans have come to expect from the group.  The end result is yet another marvelous Decemberists album that will certainly be ranked among the year's best.<br /><br />While past efforts have found the band exploring everything from prog rock to chamber pop and even dance (see The Perfect Crime), The King is Dead is a back to basics recording.  There is an unmistakable folk rock vibe that is reminiscent of Meloy's early work with Tarkio, as well as an early R.E.M. feel thanks in no small part to the guest guitar playing by Peter Buck.  It is almost impossible not to hear the alternative rock pioneers' fingerprints all over the album's second track, \\"Calamity Song\\" with its jangly guitar riff and Bill Berry-esque drumming.  There is also a distinctive country quality to the album, particularly on the excellent \\"All Arise\\" and on \\"Down By The Water\\" which features guest vocals by Gilian Welch.  The lyrics are outstanding as well as evidenced by the graceful \\"January Hymn\\" which floats along on a gentle breeze of emotional depth that harkens back to the best material from \\"Picaresque\\".<br /><br />Once again, The Decemberists have delivered a nearly flawless album that continues to establish them as one of the best indie rock outfits around.  Whether they are crafting complex concept albums or bathing in rootsy simplicity, the Decemberists always bring new elements and layers to each of their albums and \\"The King is Dead\\" is no exception.  What a great way to start 2011.
B002ZG999U|1.0|I love a good action movie. I especially love the idea of a good action movie filled with lots of various action stars (even washed-up action stars). So, that is why I watched The Expendables.    Aside from some over-the-top action scenes like bad guys being shredded by a big gun or the scene with Jason Statham shooting out of the front of an airplane, this movie offered me nothing (or, at least, nothing new). Quentin Tarantino movies have over-the-top action and gore as well, but he develops the characters. His characters end up being badass before or while they perform over-the-top action, therefore you truly enjoy the action scenes. There was sooooo much potential to develop the characters of these actors in this movie, but no. It was just, \\"Hey, let's go blow up some stuff on an island because we can and then go back again specifically for a girl that none of us even scores with.\\" What was the point? Where was the plot???    The best part of the movie was that it was only a little over an hour and a half long (an hour and fifteen minutes too long though). If it would have been the standard two hours, I would have cried or sent a letter to Sylvester Stallone asking for my time back. I should have known 30 minutes into it that it was going to be a bad movie.    Again, I love a good action movie, but this was not one. What a waste!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|My oldest granddaughter wanted this movie for a long time I was able to get it for her this last christmas at a very good price here at Amazon compared to other stores.  It arrived in perfect conditon and fast service thank you Amazon.  I am happy, she was happy and all ends well.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" picks up where the second novel in the Millennium series ended, which is quite unfortunate given that that story felt complete.  I was really looking forward to a new story...a new mystery for Salander to solve.  Instead, the novel commences with a lengthy rehashing from various characters of everything that happened in the second novel.  Then very, very slowly new things begin to happen.  Extremely slowly.  Every action is told in excruciating detail, and many new, extraneous characters are introduced with equal loquacity.  My god, did the editor of this book fall asleep?  They could have trimmed 300 pages from this book and lost absolutely nothing from the story.<br /><br />Ok, I'm done venting.  Despite the terrible pacing, this novel is a surprisingly decent read, and certainly anyone who has already invested the extraordinary amount of time reading the first two novels will want to complete the trilogy.  In general, though, I'm wagering that most people will like \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" a tad less than they liked Larsson's first two novels.  As a series, the books are fairly good but should have been very good, mostly because of the two main characters, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist.  They remain vibrant, interesting characters throughout the series, even though the pair is often separated and given little to do.  In this novel, for example, Lisbeth is out of action for hundreds of pages at a time while we get a litany of complaints from Erika Berger about her job.  Again, that's just poor editing and pacing.<br /><br />Fortunately, by the end of \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,\\" the entire storyline is wrapped up in a satisfactory manner, with relatively few loose ends.  There's already been talk that the series might continue with a new author.  For example, Stieg Larsson's girlfriend claims that she owns the rights to an unfinished fourth novel and that he discussed the remainder of the book with her.  Likewise, the idea of having a new author step in has been floated.  I'm actually in favor of this happening, even though I'm not usually a fan of a new author taking over a series.  In this case, I assume a new author would be given less leeway to write such poorly paced material.  Also, they could learn a great deal from the makers of the Swedish film series; the movies have been much zippier than the novels while still maintaining the same themes and basic plotlines.ikewise, the idea of having a new author step in has been floated.

B003QOCTOM|5.0|I love this show. I was actually kind of surprised that ABC Family would allow some of these storylines, but that just intrigued me so I watched more, and now I'm hooked. I don't know if it's a \\"guilty pleasure\\" or if it's just good, but either way, I'm a faithful fan now.<br /><br />As for Video on Demand, if you haven't tried it, don't be afraid. It's easy and safe. And you don't have to wait for this to come out on DVD :)
0385341679|5.0|I just finished reading this last book in the Fever series and it was absolutely perfect. I started the whole series a week ago and couldn't put them down. I'm glad I didn't have to wait for years to read the final book :)  I don't remember the last time I've been this satisfied with a series finale.     Every chapter in the book was well written and Moning outdid herself with the story line, the explanations and the ending.     If you haven't read this series you should :) You won't regret it.
B003R50FRI|5.0|Truly a traversty that I am only the second to post a review of this book. Never before has such an amazing mix lifestyle, intelligence and immaculate prose, produced such a masterpiece. my one criticism is everythimg i have since read is dissapointing in comparison.
0553593544|5.0|I love an action thriller with some modern situations that we hear about in the newspapers every day.

0439023513|3.0|I ate the first two books up. I knew that nothing MAJOR would happen until at least the middle of the book like the previous two. Since in the first book, Katniss and Peeta didn't even ENTER the hunger games till about half way through, and the same with the second book.    But in the first two, at least the time and pages was for character development, plots and other things.    ____ SPOILER ALERT_______    In THIS last book. it was about Katniss hiding in corners, not talking and basically wondering around a blank slate.  And that goes on for a pretty long time.  It kind of reminds me of the section in the last Harry Potter book where they're wondering around in the woods for WAY too long, to the point where you want to skip ahead but are scared of missing that one sentence that has meaning.     not only that but the whole Peeta thing...  he comes back more than halfway through. All crazy and doesn't remember anything.  SLOWLY he starts to be calm...  THEN THE WAR!  people die so SUDDENLY. Especially Prim. Her death happened so suddenly and out of the blue that I had to re-read that part two or three times to even understand how she got there and WHAT happened.    then at the end they ship Katniss off to be a vegetable for half a year.  and Her and Peeta Magically get back together.  no detail about them even starting to talk to each other again or anything. last thing we remember them together like was him trying to KILL her right? It just seemed so RUSHED. a whole book of morning sleeping and depression with one paragraph for an ending.

This could of been a 5 star cd as there isn't a bad song in the bunch but again, why is the sound produced so low? This band has a Deep Purple feel to it and i hope there will be more cd's from this band in the future.

B002QFYJF4|5.0|I purchased the movie because the reviews were intriguing and the Blu-ray version was on sale at Amazon for less than $10.  The used prices on the movie were as much or more than the new price so I figure if I hated it I could sell it and get my money back. I won't be selling it, ever.<br /><br />I do not believe you can watch Magnolia once and understand what is happening. It becomes clearer on subsequent views because the movie plants very clear clues throughout but in a non-linear fashion.  The metaphysical side of the movie is extremely subtle but always present.  The spiritual transparency reminds me of an old quote \\"Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous.\\"  I thoroughly enjoyed the whispy nature of the metaphysical side of the film.<br /><br />On the first viewing you'll probably connect with one or more of the story lines but may still be confused about the movie's point, especially by the ending.<br /><br />On the second viewing you begin to understand better that Earl Partridge is the patriarch of all the interconnected stories.  All the stories deal with Love in its many, many forms, and quite a few are presented in Magnolia. Besides connecting with one or more story lines you begin connecting with the expressions, reactions, and resolutions we all make about Love in our lives.<br /><br />The third viewing is just fun to try to find all the references to Exodus 8:2, like a Where's Waldo on a moving screen.  This exercise is actually more enjoyable to do with more than one person.  My wife caught references I missed and visa versa.  I seriously doubt we found them all after three viewings.<br /><br />By the second or third viewing you'll begin to understand the major message of the movie, besides Love, is \\"you may be through with the past but the past ain't through with you.\\"  It is this point that will keep you thinking or talking about Magnolia long after the credits fade.  My wife and I talked for hours, connecting circumstances in our resolved and unresolved pasts with the experiences of the characters in the film.  We both said \\"how'd they put our lives in that movie?\\"  It is this point that is key; as human beings we all have similar patterns in our lives and Magnolia brilliantly displays some of the most familiar.<br /><br />If you have an analytical nature; if you enjoy thinking deeply about the messages of films, buy Magnolia.

006145205X|1.0|I very much enjoyed Matt Ridley's \\"Genome\\" and got this as a result.  It is entertaining but is simply riddled with errors, omissions and loaded language.  I wanted to read it after having read a number of books recently about climate change, species depletion, water shortages and so on.  I genuinely wanted to see some optimistic arguments about humanity's future based on credible research.  Matt Ridley is certainly optimistic but I found very little credible information to support his optimism.      I'm going to refer to a single sentence on page 293 that I think reflects the paucity of most of the arguments.  The sentence, in full - \\" Even if you take E.O. Wilson's wildly pessimistic guess that 27,000 species are dying out every year, that equates to just 2.7 per cent a century (there are thought to be at least 10 million species), a long way short of 50 per cent in sixty years.\\"    I would like to make 3 points about this sentence.    1)  What does the \\"Even if\\" mean at the beginning of the sentence?   There is no evidence in the paragraph that E.O. Wilson's \\"guess\\" should not be taken.   There is no evidence elsewhere in the book that it should not be taken.  So what is the word \\"even\\" doing, or implying in this sentence?   Other than that Matt Ridley does not agree with this \\"guess\\", which I believe E.O. Wilson has referred to as an \\"estimate\\".   If Matt Ridley disagrees with this, why not provide a better one from a credible source?    2) What does \\"wildly pessimistic\\" mean?   There is no evidence presented that it is pessimistic anywhere in the book.   E.O. Wilson is widely regarded as one of the world's leading authorities on this topic, the implication that he would make a \\"wildly pessimistic guess\\" seems to be unjustified.  My understanding of E.O. Wilson's work is that it is based on empirically researched, peer-reviewed scientific papers.  \\"Wildly pessimistic guess\\" seems little short of simply belittling E.O.Wilson, because it suits Ridley's arguments to do so without offering a shred of information in support.    3) My recollection of E.O.Wilson's work is that he refers to the extinction of many species which are at, or near, the top of the food chain.  Removing these from the ecosystem has long been recognized as having an dramatic impact on the ecosystem in which they live.  Why does  Ridley not refer to this?    These 3 points above are largely typical of the book's style which uses heavily loaded language, denigrates the work of others without providing factual evidence to the contrary and simply ignores highly relevant information which might run counter to the book's argument.
B0042816YK|1.0|The movie had the feel of a New York Times Magazine article put to film.  Ugh.  Self-involved, self-indulgent, East Coast, upper-middle class, spoiled  woman (who supposedly loses \\"all her money\\" at the beginning of the film but still can fly to Rome, hang out for months at a time with no visible means of support, then hang out in India for another few months, then Bali for a few months after that -- who knew you losing all your money resulted in a jet-set lifestyle?) travels the world to find herself and in the end, doesn't really do a very good job at that simple task.  This is just a variation of the annoying paeans to the bourgeoisie we see every couple of years, e.g., \\"Click!\\"; \\"The Family Man.\\"  If you want real self-discovery material, see \\"The Razor's Edge\\" or the unfortunately forgotten \\"Bagdad Caf&eacute;.\\"<br /><br />As for Ms. Roberts, she seems bent on fulfilling her own prophecy from \\"Notting Hill\\": \\"one day not long from now, my looks will go, they will discover I can't act and I will become some sad middle-aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while.\\"

B003UBTX72|3.0|Like many others, I'm amazed at Keith. His recollection is scary. His ability to retell a long story is wild. In that is the problem for me - the book became tedious. Nothing is left on the \\"cutting room floor\\" and a lot should have been.

B003OFHMKO|5.0|Other than the synthesized harmonica (and jazz harmonica is certainly a debatable point), I can't hear any reason for unhappiness or even mere dissatisfaction with this album...that is unless you feel/think our Society's permanently stuck in a depressed state.    I hear a confidant blend of the Phrygian depth of Traditional jazz vocals and the upbeat light-heartedness of Brazilian jazz which is mostly textural, rather than a lyrical standard.  Esperanza(Hope) is a master instrumentalist and so it's not as fitting to compare her to musician's who are lyricist's alone...compare her to Diana Krall and you would find a technical dissertation on vertical/horizontal rhythmic postures, compare her to Terry Callier and you'd half understand my use of the term phrygian.  The album begins with a beautiful poetical dedication which leaves a great deal of space for musing about interpretation and metaphysics and such...which is perfect because the second piece is so philosophical that it poses a question which is answered in a Cadenza.  At this point the Muse is free to go and to do as it pleases...to the standard or back to the vein! Apple Blossom is a beautiful homage that opens a mystical channel to Venus' warmth rather than to the cold of Pluto (or Hades, as in L'Orfeu).  What remains are an intimation into the artist's own comfort zone (or at least to her musical preferences)...and so; unless you know of some out of work jazz harmonica player, there's really no worthy complaint.    And I just finished listening to the Blackbyrds...mindblowing vertical texture!!!
B002ZG9774|5.0|The film version \\"Burlesque\\" only ran under one hour forty minutes, SADLY. For the DVD version runs 2 hours  and is the best \\"ORIGINAL\\" musical since \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" If it was not the hit expected in theatres I hope  it gets a second chance on DVD. And I even hope, beyond hopes, that the complete version will end up one  day playing back at theatres. \\"Christina\\" is fantastic...she is a star! She can act, sing, and dance and  \\"CHER\\" is the \\"DIVA\\" with two powerful numbers. I only wish she was given more to do. But they work well  together. I don't know the cost of the film but it all dazzles on the screen. Yes, there are hints of  \\"Fosse\\" and \\"Cabaret\\" but it is a film for today's generation.    It's upseting when a great film, especially a musical, doesn't get the attention it deserves. I only wish  \\"ALAN CUMMINGS'\\" number, \\"That's Life\\" would have been put back into the film. Luckily, it is the one  deleted number. But it should have never been deleted for it works with the rest of the film.    Forget the movie critics on this one. All they did was attempt to destroy a great musical. For pure  entertainment, young and old, this film should be seen by every musical film lover.
1596434252|5.0|When I look it over, I keep thinking, \\"I didn't even know the ALPHABET did that (check out O-P-Q-R, for instance), much less that a single book could have so many different techniques in one volume.\\" It really must be a huge effort to produce each one. To the more negative reviewers here: I think you might be looking at the wrong things. This isn't an \\"alphabet book.\\" It's a pop-up book that happens to use the letters of the alphabet as its \\"raw matter,\\" and of _course_ there's more exciting material to use! But to keep the focus on the techniques themselves, it works. For current and future paper engineers, it's an inspiration. I do have to wonder what these folks were expecting the letters might do -- leap out and... I dunno, hand you some money? clean your house? perform acts I can't write about here? Well, I can't control how the book was marketed, but it seems to me that those who don't appreciate it may need to readjust their expectations a little. And no way is it for little kids; know your audience and that they'll take good care with it.    At the same time, I'm actually pleased to see that the trippy lenticular cover was apparently not part of the original design. On the flipside, how gross that it's this way for the American version -- I can just imagine selling the author on the idea: \\"No, it's not tacky! With this cover, it'll fly off the shelves.\\" Well, it's certainly possible that it's selling better here than the more sedate cover would have, but it's the least appealing part of the book for me.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|The unsettling tale of a good man turned bad out of desperation to not leave his family with mountains of debt.  What's the solution?  Open a meth lab with one of his old students and proceed down the dangerous path of operating with criminals and their drug lord overseers.  To complicate matters his brother-in-law is with the DEA, his wife is pregnant and his teenage son has cerebral palsy.  There's a lot of humor interwoven with the more serious themes which I can understand or this would be unwatchable.  The emotional arc of the main character, a borderline genius, is one of the more refreshing elements to watch.  Think from caterpillar to butterfly (but in a bad way).  Good to great supporting cast (Hank is the best).  Extremely clever uses of chemistry (especially with fulminated mercury). It has won several Emmies since 2008, including PeaBody Award (2008) and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (2010).

B000LXHK2C|3.0|This movie is very cute and very forgettable.  A  typical arrogant and ruthless English stock broker who inherits his uncle's vineyard in Provence and falls in love with a beautiful French woman.  Should he sell the winery and make a small fortune, or should he do the right thing by keeping it, and thus keeping his uncle's memory alive and his love as well?  I won't spoil the ending - I'll let you guess.  (Hint - it's a happy ending!)  I bought the DVD thinking that I might see something on wine making in Provence, France, but no such luck.  In fact, even the scenery was rather lacking.  The casting and acting was wonderful, however, as was directing and editing.  It's the dialogues that were bit tired.  All-in-all, a cute movie to watch with your husband/lover/boyfriend, etc, etc.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|The Decemberists put aside complexity to focus on tight songwriting and stellar arrangements, and create a barn-burner of a longplayer that comes across as the sweetest alt-country band in the world paying homage to their 80's heroes. Peter Buck turns Calamity Song and Down by the Water into your two favorite REM songs. Rox in the Box is based on the traditional arrangement perfected by the Waterboys' Raggle Taggle Gypsy, and their Spring Comes to Spiddal is referenced in the gorgeous June Hymn. Lastly, This is Why We Fight utilizes a tremendous Johnny Marr guitar line to perfect effect. All this lends a familiarity to the proceedings, which use a heavy Americana brush to evoke the emptiness of the mythical west complete with pedal steel and harmonica. And Gillian Welch's Appalachian drawl pulls the entire album together, adding color and depth behind Colin's vocals. Hopefully this signals a new direction for the Decemberists, not a tangent, because it deserves further attention and exploration. Brilliant.

As far as I can tell, this is an (autobiography???) about a very dysfunctional person (and her family), but I am having a hard time trying to figure out what the point of the whole book is. It seems to be written more ABOUT her than BY her. You know- when you read an autobiography, it's usually about some relatively famous person's life and you want to know more about it. Obviously, since this book is written by a man and it is some strange sort of an autobiography of a woman (main character Patty) and I think it is fiction, I am not really sure what I am going to get out of this book in the end. If it is just fiction- you sort of expect a story and wait to see how it ends. I'm not getting that, either. It's very odd how it is written. I guess I just don't get it......

B004A8ZX14|4.0|When actresses of a certain caliber and age reach a certain level of potential bankability and critical respect, it appears inevitable that they do a standard-issue Hollywood romantic comedy. Talent becomes a less critical factor in these casting selections. Early last year, Amy Adams did one between [[ASIN:B001PA0FFO Doubt]] and The Fighter, a silly one set in Ireland called [[ASIN:B0038N9X3Q Leap Year]], and now it's Natalie Portman's turn. This 2011 film has a more provocative premise and a snappier tone, but the sensibilities are still very much in rom-com territory. As written by first-time screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether and directed by industry veteran Ivan Reitman (whose last film was the overdone [[ASIN:B000J4QW8Q My Super Ex-Girlfriend]]), the movie deftly asks a less than earth-shattering question: can two friends sustain a commitment-free sexual relationship without any emotional expectations? In an age when text messaging makes anyone instantly available, the answer naturally looks to be yes, but Hollywood convention intervenes.<br /><br />Set conveniently in LA, the plot centers on the friendship between Emma, an overworked medical resident, and Adam, an overlooked production assistant on a [[ASIN:B000F2BNW2 High School Musical]]-type show who longs to be a writer. Moving fleetly from summer camp to a frat party to an accidental run-in at an outdoor market, they definitely have a connection but never act upon it. In the meantime, their personalities take shape as adults nearing thirty. She is an unromantic pragmatist who has convinced herself that she doesn't need a relationship to have sex, while he is a pushover whose airheaded girlfriend dumps him for his father, a self-infatuated former sitcom TV celebrity. After an all-night drunken binge lands a naked Adam in Emma's apartment, she proposes they take advantage of their mutual attraction and start a purely physical relationship with no expectation of commitment. She's in charge, and he agrees to play along. Needless to say, both start to have feelings that pull them in predictable directions with Adam also dealing with his unresolved anger toward his father. There is no real tension to the central dilemma since we all know how the movie will end, especially with stars as attractive and laid-back as Portman and Ashton Kutcher playing the leads.<br /><br />What I do like is how Portman doesn't subterfuge her own sensibilities as an actress to play Emma within formula. She plays a workaholic but on her terms as a sensible professional who needs to manage her schedule carefully. Unlike rom-com contemporaries like Kate Hudson, Anne Hathaway or Kristin Bell, Portman comes across as too smart to go through much humiliating shtick to get her inevitable comeuppance beyond devouring a box of donut holes. Even though Kutcher has more experience in this genre, he comes across a bit more substantive this time around and shows a natural rapport with Portman that makes the movie breeze along with aplomb. A solid supporting cast helps with Greta Gerwig ([[ASIN:B002ZG97T2 Greenberg]]) and Mindy Kaling ([[ASIN:B002N5N5SO The Office]]) as Emma's sharp-tongued roommates; Lake Bell ([[ASIN:B0038N9WKU It's Complicated]]) as Adam's dithering, sweet-natured associate; Jake Johnson and a low-key Ludacris as his horndog buddies; and Kevin Kline as his vainglorious father.

Way too often employees say that the words about how important \\"our people are\\" fall short and are really only window dressing in frames on lobby walls.<br />Employees know when words and actions meld and they know when the words smell of insincerity.<br />Hseish prompts us to do better, to take a risk, to study, research, and then give happiness a chance.<br />This book is a must read for anyone who wants to make relationships the driver for selling products.<br />I have a friend who summed up what this book is about perfectly \\"You don't have to close your heart to make a profit\\". Tony Hseish would agree.<br />Sylvia Lafair, author, \\"Don't Bring It to Work\\"
1439107955|5.0|Excellent book, encompasses the scientific, social and political history of cancer. A long book, over 400 pages in small type about a difficult theme very well written. I highly recommend this book to people interested in taking control of their bodies.
1591843162|4.0|This is both a business book and a call to action, especially in the area of education. Godin claims most of us have been taught to be mediocre. He's right! His opening line is \\"You are a genius\\". Right again!<br />Since we are programmed initially for survival, that lizard brain is there to keep us alive. Yet, it is not there for juicy creativity, that is in the area of the neocortex.<br />To get the higher levels of the brain moving we have to untie old \\"nots\\" such as \\"am not, cannot, will not, not good enough, and not like me\\".These self-fulfilling prophecies that keep us stuck and limited begin in our original organziation, the family and folow us to school which is not set up for us to challenge....anything!And by the time we go to work....zombieville!<br />To get us out of the rut Godin talks about takes more than just quitting a job or jumping off a cliff.<br />I believe we are moving into new, uncharted territory where we will have to shake up both business and education or die of boredom. This book is a powerful call to all of us to say \\"we're sick and tired of the fear that says don't rock the boat cause you'll fall out and drown.\\" On to Burning Man anyone?????<br />Sylvia Lafair, author, \\"Don't Bring it to Work\\"
1416596097|4.0|By sheer coincidence this was my first Le Carré. I was slightly disappointed too, although some reviewers overdo by saying that's a waste of time and money.   Putting it stright - the author simply gets old. That's him, who with banker's Tommy Brue's eyes observes the new breed (lawyer Annabel Richter and self-assured Ian Lantern), who unlike \\"old farts\\" don't touch wine, but order room temperature water. I also felt Le Carré's keenness to say, that romantic high spy adventures of the Cold War era are long since gone. The most sympathetic character in the whole story is German intelligence officer Günter Bachmann, who despite being aware that Hamburg after 9/11 is a \\"guilty city\\" refuse to acquiesce to new realities till the very last page. His neatly weaved designs and thoughts, probably, embody the views of most of liberals, who may use the term \\"war on terror\\", only if are forced to. The chapters, where Bachmann presents his operational proposal, certainly deserve a round of applause from a careful reader. At the end, and not surprisingly, his views prove to be totally irrelevant.   In the war on terror the decisions are made in a parallel universe, the author says. There are neither obvious villains (only hatchet-faces and ash-blond mystery women) nor sympathetic victims (Issa). And finally, a reader is bound to realize, that in such a war there is no place for a convincing and dramatic resolution of the plot either.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|Although my favorite doctor will always be Tennent, Series 5 of Doctor Who is a fun abd exciting watch.  True, they don't get into the feelings of the characters like Davies did, but it was time for a change.    My big problem is with the packaging of this box set.  It has already been noted in many reviews that the box tends to fall apart because of the single piece of tape that binds the case together, so I won't dwell on that.  What upsets me is the lack of extras that the earlier box sets had.  For 4 years, each episode had a commentary track, there was loads of extra footage (video diaries, outtakes, deleted scenes, etc) and even a nice booklet with a good essay from one of the production team members.  Gone is booklet, replaced by some cheesy stickers, the video diary footage is chintzy at best, the individual monster featurettes actual recycle some of the footage scene in the Confidential episodes and, worst of all, less than half of the episodes have commentary.  True, they are \\"in-vision\\" commentaries, but what's the point of that?  Does it matter that we can see who is commenting on the action in a little window that blocks a part of the screen?  Worse still, Matt Smith doesn't do any of the commentary tracks at all.  Gillian does 2 tracks and Darvil does one, but I must say that the commentators on \\"Vampires in Venice\\" left me wanting.  Sure, some of the commentary tracks on the other box sets weren't great, but there was always enough good tracks for balance.  Maybe I'm spoiled by having David Tennant and Catherine Tate doing the commentaries (which were always filled with laughs), but the producers could have done a better job than that.  When I buy a box set, it's because I want the type of extras that you can't get by buying the discs separately.  Try harder next year, guys.  Cheap Bastards.
B000005KQT|4.0|Please excuse me for awhile before I write this review. I'm so much enjoying listening to Little Walter: His Best, and find myself being mesmerized with the music. Little Walter: His Best is a good BLUES cd. I wasn't even aware of Little Walter's great contributions to THE BLUES until His Best popped up in my recommended cds one day. Now that I'm playing and enjoying His Best, my house is being filled with good BLUES music. I can clearly see how early rock and roll developed, in part, out of Little Walter's music. Elvis Presley was probably listening to Little Walter when his singing career first took off; the same must be true of many other early rock musicians, including, but certainly not limited to, Eddie Cochran. It is also very easy to see the direct influence of Little Walter upon later BLUES artists such as John Mayall on the Bluesbreakers cd and Kim Wilson and the early Fabulous Thunderbirds. Little Walter (aka Marion Jacobs) has GREATLY influenced BLUES music, both through his own music, which remains enjoyable today, and also through his very important influence upon later BLUES musicians. Now back to the music... I enjoy each and every song on His Best. No need to ever skip a song on this cd. Little Walter has only a fair blues-singing voice. Somehow it works for me; it is a pleasure to hear him sing. Little Walter is also an outstanding harmonica player. His outstanding harmonica playing can be heard on every song on His Best. Little Walter has been called the best harmonica player ever to play in the field of BLUES music. After listening to His Best, it is easy to understand why he has such a superb harmonica reputation. Any harmonica player who plays the BLUES today is indebted to Little Walter's legacy. Finally, let me also mention that His Best has excellent sound quality, which is really surprising for music that was recorded so many years ago. After only several playings, Little Walter: His Best has already gained a spot among my favorite BLUES cds. If you enjoy TRUE BLUES MUSIC, I strongly recommend Little Walter: His Best to you.<br /><br />Johns. If you enjoy TRUE BLUES MUSIC, I strongly recommend Little Walter: His Best to you.    John
0312370849|4.0|so... this is one of those books in which you wish the author hadn't tried to be so clever....  i was both horrified and fascinated to learn of the vel d'hiv roundup in paris, but why all the convenient plot contrivances? why the duel storyline? sarah's story is very specific, feels very real (even if it is only inspired by non-fiction rather than actually being non-fiction)... and there is no doubt that one feels the distinct complicite' of the french, but even this is repeatedly overexplained, (as if we didn't quite get it) and unfortunately sarah gets lost in the overall book, the architecture of which lacks sophistication or subtlety. the modern story here does not at all earn its weight in the book... it feels self-indulgent and whiny in comparison to sarah's story. so many times things were imbued with too much dramatic significance... whereas the chapters involving sarah seemed tonally spot-on.    i realise i'm not being totally coherent here, and apologise (it's very late). worth reading... but i suspect you may feel it falls down a bit. i deliberately haven't read the other reviews yet and am very interested to see if anyone agrees with my viewpoint...
B0046ECFRM|5.0|As an English teacher, I had this recommended to me by a colleague. The story is sweet, engaging and keeps you asking the question as old as time-- is he interested? THe setting of boarding school and Paris, France along with the realities of leaving home and making friends are very true-to-life. I am recommending this title to one of my students ASAP :)
B001B71NOI|4.0|I'll start off by saying I'm a huge fan of Nine Inch Nails and I've enjoyed every one of their studio releases. I think that's why it was so hard for me to accept this album when it was released a few years back. I was expecting something along the lines of what I'd usually get from Nine Inch Nails. An album that sounds nothing like the previous yet still manages to hold the same power and lasting appeal. I think that's where this album falls short as it sounds like a lot of previous Nine Inch Nails jumbled together into one CD. Also, I don't find myself coming back to it as often as I do Broken, With Teeth, (Still), Ghosts, The Downward Spiral...etc.<br /><br />  Giving this album a star rating is hard because there's so many ways it can be reviewed. One way would be to compare it to every other Nine Inch Nails release in which case I'd have to give it 2 stars. I could also rate the album on quality of music compared to everything else that was released by other bands and artists during that 5 year time frame in which case I'd have to give the album 5 stars. I'm going to go ahead and go somewhere inbetween and give it a 4.<br /><br />  It's great music it's just not what the fans have come to expect. If you're not familiar with Nine Inch Nails this would be a great introduction to some of their older material. If you are a long time fan you may not care for this album as much due to high expectations. Either way I think everyone should give the album a shot considering it can be downloaded for free on the official website. Go to the website, download the album, give it a listen. If you love it come back and order the CD/DVD combo pack (Which comes with great live studio performances of 5 of the tracks, which add a lot of power to the songs). If you hate it you can forget about it without feeling like you've been cheated.
0553381687|4.0|The book's very well written. However, there is no end in sight.<br /><br />He released four books from the series out from between 1996 and 2005. In six years since, he has not completed Dance with Dragons, the fifth book of the series. There are still two more books scheduled to be released after Dance.<br /><br />Be warned that he may not finish this series. If you start you may set yourself up for disappointment. Wait to see if the full \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series gets completed before starting any books.<br /><br />I was hoping that the HBO contract would entice him to finish up the series, but based on HBO's past performance (Carnivale, Deadwood) I won't hold my breath.
0142410322|3.0|We bought this book.<br /><br /> Did you think Charlie's adventures ended when he won the chocolate factory? As it turns out Charlie's day didn't even end there. Once in the Great Glass Elevator Charlie (and all the Buckets) found themselves on a wild journey to some really strange places. Really strange. In one of Dahl's wildest stories childrens' classic hero Charlie finds himself orbiting Earth, fighting aliens, traveling to unreal places like Minusland and most off all, trying to convince his grandparents to get out of the bed they've been in for the last twenty years.<br /> Dahl is famous for his dark, wry view of just about everything. In The Witches he took on women, in Charlie in the Chocolate Factory he took on bratty kids, in Matilda he took on the education system. In this one he takes on really lazy adults. Surely by this point readers should know Dahl was an equal opportunity -ist (or at least played one for effect through his fiction) but he was also a fantastic storyteller, slyly infusing his tales with enough dark humor and irony to make even young readers feel like they're in on Dahl's cosmic joke.<br /> Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is quite nonlinear, so it threw my more literally minded autistic son, but my daughter found the wild and crazy wild enjoyable. She especially enjoyed the space bits, which were almost science fiction-y enough for her.<br /> As always, especially with Dahl's wilder works, it's an acquired taste, not for all readers. But avid readers will want to taste Dahl's clever, intelligent story telling which, unlike many kids books (especially those tied in with movies, TV shows or licensed characters) doesn't treat young readers like thick-headed dummies who need moral messages drilled into their heads.<br /><br /> Contains: Bad science, mean old people<br /><br /> Recommended for: 8-12 yrs, flexible
1594202842|5.0|Amy Chua is brilliant, brave, honest, and insightful. She has told the truth about how she raised two high achieving children who understand and accept her parenting style (otherwise, they would have already reported their mother to Child Services for abusing them). At the same time, she maintains her career as a law professor at top notch universities. She also has a high achieving and loving husband who understands and supports her. The major lesson taken from this book is that achievement is attained through hard work, entitlement and pampering will not help kids excel. If all American parents possess her attitude about education, students will learn to be responsible for their success and failure. We will not have the problems we are facing in education.

0312600844|1.0|at our last book group meeting, which i was unable to attend, someone suggested this book.  our meeting is 3 nights from now, and i've read up to page 130. i'm a very fast reader.  i have read many books which i've not liked - i majored in English literature in college.  i don't think i've ever read a book i've disliked more than this one.  i've actually put aside more interesting things to try to get this thing read, but today i gave up.  i decided to write a review.  i've eagerly been reading the reviews titled \\"spoiler alert\\" so as to know what happens (i was thinking about faking it at the meeting).  Could someone post a MAJOR spoiler alert with highlights, so some of us can know what \\"happens\\"?  does a plot ever develop?    i'm not quite sure what the point of this book is.  i've read the reviews where people have mentioned it being a social commentary.  fine and dandy.  if it is that, then society must be pretty dang boring.  the book drags.  it is boring. along with many reviewers, i don't like any of the characters.      also, as others have indicated, i wish i could have gone into the negative scoring for my review. i don't know how far down i'd go.      i purchased this book on my Barnes and Noble Nook e-reader; otherwise, since it is so big, i'd have a new nightstand on which to place a better book.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Listened to the score before I saw the movie. The music got me so hyped up, I saw the flick by myself - unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to the music's standards. However, I'm glad they made it, because this is my new favorite soundtrack.

It is an enlightening story , one of the best!
B001BJ6620|5.0|I PURCHASED THE ORIGINAL ABWH CD MAYBE 20 YRS AGO WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE. BASICALLY BEING AN UNOFFICIAL YES ALBUM WAS A JOY TO A YES FAN. DOING SOME RESEARCH ONLINE I CAME ACROSS THIS.

B004E547D8|1.0|My one star rating applies to this blu-ray release only. I saw the film in theaters an it is entertainingly enough. But Summit studio apparently created this \\"not so Special Edition\\" primarily for the rental market and also for the budget market. It is barebones, almost no extra features, but even worse only has DVD quality Dolby Digital Audio as it is only on a 25GB single disc and there wasn't enough room to include much else. You have to buy the Special Edition to get lossless DTS-HD Master Audio and all the extra features. Shame on the studio for even releasing a blu-ray without the blu-ray standard of high-def picture AND high-def sound.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Very funny sitcom about a group of friends who don't fit in with mass culture.  I liked how each character is very similiar yet different from eachother.  Sheldon has been my favorite since the sperm bank when he explains about producing a child who doesn't know if he should use an intergral or differential to find the area between curves.
0141328290|5.0|I found this book very easy to read but not so easy to put down, I read it in one sitting!  The book was written in a way that pulled you into the story, it was as if I was one of the thirteen people who got the tapes, and I needed to know what happened. Who was next, what they did to contribute to her suicide.   It was an absolutely brilliant book. Very inspiring as well. People don't realise how much their words can hurt people and this book is a clever way to get the message across.   An absolutely fantastic read I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|I ordered this DVD series after hearing how fun it was to watch from a relative and I must say, I certainly wasn't disappointed. In fact, I was surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I had.   I enjoyed the great acting, everything was very believable and that is important in a story or movie plot. OK, there were a few times when you think to yourself, \\"oh really? Can someone really be that good or lucky?\\", but that is what adds to the entertainment value I think.  So the characters are believable and likable and you end up rooting for them to suceed.  It is a drama with normal life humor interlaced into it, the characters have their ups and downs and you take the thrill ride right along with them.     This entire series (season 1-3) has been very enjoyable for me, I ended up watching one episode after another while being snowbound this winter. It was a great way to make being trapped indoors very pleasant. I also loved watching it on DVD because of the little cliff hangers of each episode, you end up saying ok, just one more tonight and soon you've seen the entire dvd.  I highly recommend all 3 seasons of \\"Breaking Bad\\".  Enjoy!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I have very mixed - feelings about this movie. It has some very witty and quick- paced dialogue. The key - courtroom scene in which the Zuckenberg character played by Jesse Eisenberg answers the Attorney of the Winklevosses is brilliant. Here the leading character makes his strongest self- defense and really expresses his credo. The world he is making is one in which it the Imaginative and Creative are the winners and masters. The 'elite' he represents an elite of merit in a sense revenges itself and puts down the 'elite' of 'money' and 'traditional privilege'. The nerdy guy outplays and outthinks the super- Old - Line giants.<br />But there is too much ugliness and too my mind, immorality in the story to give additional pleasure. The ugly side of the Zuckenberg -Facebook story is the betrayal of the friend co- founder, and the racing after the fast- lane values of the Napster founder- Sean Parker character. There is too the ugliness involved in the initial impulse for the founding of the Social Network  which is presented ( I understand non- accurately) as having come from the Zuckenberg character's being rejected by a girl he has been dating.<br />The presentation of the permissive and hedonistic world of both the academic elite at Harvard, and the business elite at 'Facebook' adds to the sense of frivolousness and superficiality.<br />It is difficult to have any real sense of some great moral message and meaning in the creation of 'Facebook' from watching this movie.The movie itself seems to be a successful effort at telling a story of Success in which the price of Success is betrayal of friendship and deeper human values.<br />Superficiality and cleverness triumph, as does pleasure and amusement.<br />So I can say I have very mixed feelings about the Movie. A slickly done job in which Slickness is criticized but nothing very Substantial is presented in its place.

This book gives hope to those working with patients, family or friends. The impact on personal development is clear too. We can no longer say \\"that's just the way I am\\", because the brain CAN change.<br /><br />Also included is information about the science and scientists behind the story.

B002Q9VPFM|4.0|If you buy this then you have to be a huge \\"Watchmen\\" fan, which I am.  Otherwise there's no reason you're going to pay to sit through 3 1/2 hours, which is what this comes out to.<br /><br />Previously WB came out with two other versions of the film.  First there was the vanilla Theatrical Cut, which was obviously the one seen in theaters that runs 2 1/2 hours and you could consider the Cliff Notes version of the story.  Then along came the \\"Director's Cut\\" that had some deleted scenes (notably the death of Hollis Mason, aka Nite Owl 1, which I don't consider a spoiler since if you're reading this again you're obviously a fan) and went about 3 hours.  On the side there was also \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" which is the animated adaptation of the comic-within-the-comic of the Watchmen graphic novel.  Plus there was \\"Under the Hood,\\" a documentary (or sort of mockumentary) about how superheroes got started in the Watchmen universe.<br /><br />Now with the Ultimate Edition the \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" is inserted into the Director's Cut version of the film with some added transitions featuring the Bernards at the newsstand, and also you get Gerard Butler's name awkwardly sandwiched into the opening credits.  This beefs the movie up to 3 1/2 hours and comes as close as you're going to get to a complete treatment of the graphic novel.<br /><br />I have to say I didn't really find this necessary.  It's nice to have the Black Freighter story since it serves as an allegory of the main story, but I thought it pulled me out of the main story.  Also since there's still no squid monster there isn't the connection between the Black Freighter and the rest of the story there was in the graphic novel, where the writer of the Black Freighter helped come up with the squid monster.<br /><br />The other four DVDs in the set contain a digital copy of the theatrical release that will not work if you bought it after November 2010.  (Thanks, WB!)  You also get \\"Under the Hood,\\" some other featurettes, and the \\"motion comics\\" that take the actual graphic novel and move it around with voices and such added.  I would have liked an actual DVD of the theatrical version instead of the non-functioning digital copy, but you can't have everything.<br /><br />As of now Amazon has run out but other sites [coughBuycoughdotcom] still have it in stock and it costs less than two tickets to the latest 3D shlockfest in the theaters.<br /><br />Really I'd say if you haven't bought anything yet then get a copy of the theatrical version for when you don't have 3 1/2 hours and the Ultimate Edition for when you do.<br /><br />That is all.me other featurettes, and the \\"motion comics\\" that take the actual graphic novel and move it around with voices and such added.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I like it; I won't lie though, I bought the album because I thought she was super HOT! on \\"Toxic\\" video, and for the album booklet. (Not a perv lol.) On account the album is 12 songs, it's a 4 to 5 star album. It seems like Britney has took a couple of vocal lessons, or either Pro Tools software grew more advanced. This is actually the second album I felt that I liked from Britney Spears. Being a straight guy, you can imagine the ridicule I suffer from my friends lol. but I think the album is not as bad as I thought it would be. The Bonus Remix with Madonna should have been the original song, because I hate the original song lol sorry. Overall you'll find it a good listen, if you're afraid to buy it, buy an used album, then you wouldn't have spent that much lol. Thanks Britney for the good album!
B0013FSL3E|4.0|This is an adorable movie. Sophisticated enough for adults, charming enough for children. My four and eight year old just can't get enough of this film. The problem lies with the packaging. Disney didn't use their standard plastic DVD case and instead did cardboard. Needless, to say after a couple of months home with this DVD, the case was falling apart, making it hard to keep scratch free and therefore sits in a separate plastic case.
B000002BQK|5.0|This album is perfect, except that \\"Fly Away\\" (Butterfly Reprise); sorry just do not like that song.

B002ZG994U|5.0|This movie was made for me: A guy who used to watch the show when he was a kid, that can still indulge his inner child with stuff like this.  This movie is 40% A-Team related stuff (The characters, their style, the way a situation is resolved) and 60% typical action movie stuff from the mid '00s (odd dialogue, unique action stuff you haven't seen yet in the myriad of other action films out there).<br />But it's a wonderful mix.  Everyone is EXCELLENT in their roles, especially the guy playing Murdock.  I saw him in District 9 and he's incredible! His range is just awesome.  I can't wait to see him in more movies.<br />This DVD is great - I thought the quality was just fine, and I'm a blu-ray fanatic myself.  This DVD does include the 2 short sequences after the end credits, showing the \\"real\\" Face and Murdock in cameo roles.  Pretty funny stuff if you're a fan of the real show.  Anyhow- great action movie with a nice mix of memories from my childhood!!!
0812973992|1.0|Do you want to have an idea of how was 70's? More precisely, do you want to have a minimal clue of how was living in New York during the 70´s?    If the answer is YES for one of the questions above, try another book. This one is great in its emptiness on describing both of them - the time when and the city where the poor characters lived their role.    And if you are looking for at least good stories, find out another book. The stories in this book have always something in common - they are slushy.    But the book has one great value - it makes you feel that if this one deserved the National Book Award, you can try to be a great writer. Even if you are a foreigner, like me.
1594202842|1.0|When purchasing \\"Battle Hymn\\", I was expecting to be taken away into a all encompassing broth of asian cuisine.  What I found was unexpected.  To be certain, the protagonist Tiger Mother's penis being crafted from unknown minerals from space was an interesting premise, but the lack of complex emotions between her and Horse People of Zibbbxxxnin during their encounter in the forbidden zone was abraisve...at best!  Worst of all, I still don't know how to properly deep fry a pigeon's brain to perfection.  Shame on Tiger Mom.
B00406UK7S|1.0|This film is horrendously bad.  Apart from some bits of passable acting and some nice photography, it has no saving graces.  Zero.  Zip.  None.  And it's not just the hilarious historical inaccuracy.  The script is a mess--first half seems to want to focus on the Romans' allegiance to their charismatic general, but he unfortunately bites the dust (in very anticlimatic fashion--they slip into the Pict camp but can't get him loose from a post??), and so we are left with a buddy survival movie...but there are so many new characters introduced so quickly and so little development of our understanding of who they are and then they quickly start getting offed too.  Then there's not one but two impressively coiffed female warriors, neither of whom has a line in the film as far as I can recollect.  The whole experience is just one predictable cliche after another.  Even the special effects are mawkish, amateurish, third-rate, totally cartoonish--an embarrassment when put beside other films (think Mel Gibson, Spielberg, Ridley Scott) which convey something of the authenticity of actual battle.  In short, an absolute horror, a groaner from start to finish and an embarrassment to all concerned.  I think I paid $4 for my copy, and I've never felt more ripped off.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|Originally, right after I saw this movie, I thought it was a solid 3-star film.  After thinking about it some more, I decided it was a solid four-star movie.<br /><br />Anymore, it's hard to find an SF movie that isn't a reimagining, a sequel, or some derivative of an older property of some kind or another.  Those can be great (witness the reboot of the \\"Star Trek\\" franchise), but by and large simply reveal the poverty of imagination of Hollywood.  So, leave it to the Germans to come up with something original, different and entertaining.<br /><br />\\"Pandorum\\" avoided all of the cliches into which I thought it would descend.  I won't list them all, in order to avoid potential spoilers.  That's part of why this movie is so original and why I upped it to four stars.  The movie begins with the mystery of two crewmen who just came out of hypersleep on a long space voyage, who don't remember who they are or what their mission is.  One good thing about \\"Pandorum\\" is that the mystery is resolved approximately halfway through the film, so that the movie can progress to an actual ending.  The movie provides actual answers to the mysteries it sets up, which is another refreshing change from the \\"Lost\\"-era school of Hollywood entertainment.<br /><br />The sets are truly amazing - these are large, expansive, actual physical sets.  The credits maintain that the film was shot partly on location in Berlin, and I suspect that creative use was made of old East Berlin buildings and locations.  Regardless, someone really cared a lot about how this movie looked, and about making the Elysium seem like as big a spaceship as it was supposed to be.  \\"Pandorum\\" isn't one of those cheapjack direct-to-DVD movies that tries to convince you that three hallways and a room are a 50,000 person starship.<br /><br />On the downside, some of the \\"monsters\\" are more laughable than scary.  To the extent that anything about \\"Pandorum\\" is derivative, some elements of it look like the video game \\"Dead Space,\\" but, so what?<br /><br />If you like science fiction, you will probably enjoy this movie, and it's at least worth a rent.

B004EI3ON4|5.0|I have to admit I wasn't blown away by the soundtrack when I saw the movie; I realize now it's because the visual spectacle that is TRON: LEGACY distracted me from the soundtrack.    Now that I've downloaded the soundtrack and listened to it many times on its own I am convinced this sountrack will be considered to be as much as a landmark as Wendy Carlos' indelible TRON soundtrack.    It's especially worth getting the amazon.com exclusive download \\"Sea of Simulation.\\" -- it reminds me of some of Art of Noise's work such as their song Brilliant Noise.    Daft Punk have perfectly fused electronica and the classical orchestra, quite a feat I would say. Each track stands on its own.    My favorites are \\"The Grid\\" (nice exposition by Jeff Bridges), Son of Flynn, Recognizer, Rinzler, The Game has Changed, End of Line (of course), Derezzed (of course), Solar Sailer, Disc Wars, C.L.U., Sea of Simulation.

B0034G4OXQ|2.0|Truly great cinema is a form of emotional conjuring trick: a way of presenting sounds and images - which, by their nature, we know have been contrived to induce a certain emotional and intellectual reaction - in a way which nonetheless genuinely induces that reaction.<br /><br />It's a trick that Clint Eastwood, against the odds, has become rather good at. So much so that, by his reputation alone, part of his work is done before we even take our seats: we like Clint Eastwood: we like his films. We will him to present a film what will enthral us. Our suspension of disbelief is fully willing. We happily disregard occasional dissonances. Clint Eastwood has earned the benefit of our doubt.<br /><br />And so, Hereafter opens promisingly: A black screen, backed by gentle augmented trills on a Spanish guitar, builds into a wide shot of a languid Pacific paradise. We know from its title this is a film about loss, so we look for a sign of lurking menace. And there it is: the gently breaking surf. Behind it, the sleeping heft of the azure ocean. We track a handsome French couple around their hotel room. There, reflected in every window, lying in wait behind every vista: that casual, loitering threat.<br /><br />So far, so very, very good.<br /><br />We are aided by the introduction of C&eacute;cile de France, a Class A smouldering French beauty. She magnetises our attention in a way that only Class A smouldering French beauties can. As the monstrous ocean broods, she flounces grumpily out of the love nest, leaving her layabout boyfriend to lie in while she arranges checkout, orders him breakfast, and goes out to buy gifts for his kids. His kids.<br /><br />Our internal voice says, \\"a lazy, married, bounder of a paramour? He'll be a villain then.\\"<br /><br />But wait a minute: Isn't that a bit obvious? Did we just see a magician's wire?<br /><br />We park the dissonance: Clint Eastwood has earned that. There follows shortly a set piece involving a natural catastrophe: I won't spoil what it is, but it drives much of the drama that subsequently unfolds. Now: if you were a director of this sort of film, how would you present such a plot driver: by subtle touch - implying the horror; leaving the carnage to the reader's imagination? Or would you cart in Industrial Light & Magic and give it the whole Bruckheimer treatment?<br /><br />Another odd dissonance. Still, we park it. The scene isn't all ham-fisted, by any stretch: Along the way Eastwood throws in some thoughtful tableaux: It is a film about death, but who is dying? What is the afterlife we glimpse? Is it really anything of the sort? Carefully, Eastwood refrains from answering (though there will be those viewers who will miss the subtle equivocation and assume he does).<br /><br />The narrative driver triggered, Hereafter settles down to exposition. We are introduced to three unrelated, geographically dislocated stories, so there is a lot of it. It's a magic trick, remember, so we know there will be some pay-off by which all this narrative will come together, but as the film progresses it is hard to imagine how this could possibly happen. We think: it will take a skilled conjurer indeed to pull this one off.<br /><br />And, as these strands slowly unfurl themselves, the odd dissonances keep ringing.<br /><br />We meet twin 12-year-old brothers, each astonishingly self-motivated, diligently doing their homework in their council estate flat and organising their own photographic portraits while their heroin addict mother (it is implied) turns tricks and comes home blitzed out of her brains. When Social Services come knocking, the boys resourcefully hold them off, covering for and reconditioning their mother. They singlehandedly hold together their household. Again, a dissonance: implausibility. We think: really?<br /><br />As we alternate between the stories, we're given rather clanging signposts to show us which one we're in: A wide shot of the Eiffel Tower for France: Tower Bridge for London.<br /><br />We meet Matt Damon - excellent, as ever, and unquestionably the beating heart of the film. He's in San Francisco, a retired psychic called George Lonegan. Eastwood equivocates ever-so subtly about Lonegan's \\"gift\\", and the extent of it (again, credulous viewers will miss this). But, Eastwood defuses this tension: However real Lonegan's powers may be, he is no charlatan. He's saddled, not blessed, with the gift. He refuses to profit from it, or even use it. When he is obliged into exercising it (rather easily, it must be said: the lady doth protest too much, methinks), he does it decently. He doesn't manipulate: he isn't cruel. Somewhat needlessly, we're invited to further admire Lonegan for his passion for Charles Dickens. (In a visit to Dickens' house, Lonegan thrills an entire tour party by correctly identifying a picture of the author asleep while all his characters float around him as \\"Dickens' Dream\\". I mean, the acumen!)<br /><br />Still dissonances continue to ring. Eastwood's emotional manipulation begins to reveal itself. Particularly with the London Twins, who have been written so sympathetically that no acting or film-making talent is required to ensure we are emotionally invested in them: Who wouldn't be? But then it slowly occurs that very little film-making or acting talent is on display anyway. Again, we wonder, is that a magician's wire we can see?<br /><br />Finally, the spell is broken: our French Bombshell, Marie Le Lay (a comedy name almost as good as the actress' real one) visits a Swiss mountain-top clinic specialising in knowledge about the afterlife (I couldn't tell whether it was a cancer hospice, a suicide clinic, or both) to be lectured on plot signposting so she could bring the picture home. It is a clumsy scene: clumsily conceived, clumsily scripted and clumsily acted.<br /><br />It was then it hit me that Clint Eastwood had totally, completely, lost my complicity in his enterprise: his conjuring trick had failed. Hereafter was suddenly preposterous, manipulative and, frankly, daft.<br /><br />I looked at my watch. We were a good hour and a half into the movie, and there was scant evidence of a means to drive the characters together.<br /><br />And then suddenly, in a tsunami of implausibility, there they all were: a redundant factory worker from San Francisco, a ten year old boy from South London and a French television Journalist, all wandering around Alexandra Palace in North London. Again, you think: *really*?<br /><br />As the credits rolled, I was left wondering what Eastwood had said, artistically, while presenting his illusion. I concluded: not really anything. The film is no more or less equivocal about the afterlife than it was at the beginning, and in any case has very little to say about it anyway. If it was a metaphor for something else, it was difficult to comprehend what.<br /><br />We will see more of C&eacute;cile de France in the coming months and years, I dare say, but how well this film does in the hereafter is harder to predict.<br /><br />Olly Buxtone's in San Francisco, a retired psychic called George Lonegan.

B001O1O71C|4.0|Another tale of Nazi Germany from a child's perspective?  This was an excellent story with a different twist.  Instead of starting from the beginning, the author drops you in the tale and catches you up as the story goes along.  A short, fast-paced story that I wouldn't have picked up on my own, but read in record time after it was recommended by a friend.
0060936223|5.0|This book is a work of poetry, both in narrative and content.  Not as a portrait of bohemian New York in the early 70s, but as a story of a simple, middle-class girl from New Jersey who goes to New York to seek her fortune. She doesn't know who she is or what she wants to become, but she is driven by a desire to learn; learn about poetry and drawing and people, and eventually music. She learns by reading and meeting people and adsorbing new ideas. She has no money and lives on handouts and begging and sleeps in the park. She falls in with the hippie artistic crowd who help her find food and a place to live. Eventually she meets a young Robert Mapplethorpe who later become a famous photographer. (After Mapplethorpe's death from AIDS, a print of Andy Warhol was auctioned for $643,200, making it the 9th most expensive photograph ever sold.) Robert plays a central element in Patti Smith's life. They become lovers, but his bisexuality impact their relationship (to earn money Robert becomes a male prostitute). The book is mainly about the relationship between Robert and Patti and his impact on how Patti Smith sees the world and herself. She was primarily interested in writing poetry and drawing. She is willing to live without food, without showers, and without money in order to peruse her dreams although she is not sure what they are or where they will lead. But eventually they lead to a strong sense of identity and self satisfaction, and coincidentally, national fame (Her musical album Horses is one of the top 100 albums of all time. A famous Mapplethorpe photograph of her is on the cover). Patti was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. As a Washington Post review says, \\"Just Kids\\" is one of the best books ever written on becoming an artist\\". But it is more than that: It is about just being who you are, but always striving for something better.     This book won the National Book Award. The award is but one more example of Patti Smith not knowing where she is going, but having a fierce determination to get there and through pushing ahead day by day, ending up with national recognition and success. What a life Patti Smith has led, and it isn't over!
0670034711|5.0|I have been trying to find myself for as long as I can remember, and it wasn't until reading about Elizabeth Gilbert's own experiences, that I found words that mimicked my own thoughts.  It was refreshing to read the thoughts, no matter how trivial, and the need for something greater than us.  I myself have been struggling with the spiritual side of life and I thought the book helped put things in perspective I never would have on my own.  While I am still a long ways from being \\"enlightened\\" but I have a better understanding of myself and a better idea of what my next steps are.  I am so very glad I read this book and while I realize some people do not like it, I for one love it.  To each their own.
B001C46P2K|5.0|I'm a big fan of historical romances and dramas, but normally I'll watch them once and be done with it. \\"The Young Victoria\\", on the other hand, has a certain unique quality that makes me want to watch it over and over. Though it deals with the usual complex political intrigue one would expect in a film about Queen Victoria, the story moves along quickly and the scenes are compact and well edited. So you won't find any long-winded dialogue scenes or slow spots. Besides that, the film is a joy to look at - the costumes are like eye candy and the cinematography is delightful (notice the close-ups of the glasses and people at the King's birthday banquet).     Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention what is probably one of the best on-screen romances ever. The relationship and marriage of Victoria and Albert is portrayed so tenderly you can't help but root for them both. You'd be hard pressed to find better chemistry between two actors on screen.    You won't find a heavy Best Picture Oscar-caliber film here, but you will find a pleasant film you will want to watch over and over.

B004G6009K|4.0|Disney looks like it's going to have a great year. With the eye-popping TRON: Legacy recently unleashed on cinemas, its follow up is the equally impressive, though decidedly more traditional Disney fare of Tangled, a clever reworking of the Rapunzel fairy story.<br /><br />Both are supposed to be amongst the most expensive movies ever made. That's a pretty big punt for one studio in the austere times of 2010.<br /><br />But then, when you celebrate, you should do it in style. As the opening titles roll, Disney announces that Tangled is its 50th feature length animation, and in that spirit I suppose it has tried to throw in something for everyone, and impressively, has succeeded. There's the princess in the tower, musical numbers, a Robin Hood- like rascally hero, and a wide cast of hilarious bit parts including a gang of villainous but kind-hearted ruffians and what has to be the most scene-stealing horse in motion picture history.<br /><br />Tangled certainly passed the real acid test: I went armed with two sceptical boys (who professed they'd rather watch TRON: Legacy) and a highly enthusiastic five year old girl, who wanted nothing more than to see a beautiful princess, and all of them came out fizzing.<br /><br />It's interesting where this places Disney. In the same month that Disney demonstrates with TRON its technical credentials and, perhaps, how far In George Lucas' direction it is prepared to stray from its original mandate, it also shows a marked return to its most classic era - something that has been a deliberate strategy for the company over the last couple of years. For Tangled is fundamentally, an innocent, fun tale. It harks back to Disney's heyday: It is populated by a tried and true Disney archetypes: a classic evil witch of the Cruella de Ville mould, a feisty but fundamentally pre-feminist 18 year-old heroine in Rapunzel herself (in this way contrasting quite markedly with Shrek's Fiona), sidekicks in the form of unlikely but adorable animals, and a cuddly rogues gallery intended only to provide comic relief.<br /><br />And true to this description Tangled is an altogether less knowing, less arch adventure than any of the Pixar outings to date, where you fancy they've targeted the parents and thrown in the odd jokes to keep the kids engaged. Here, this is a kids' movie pure and simple, and is none the worse for it either: as long as you check your cynical fin-du-si&egrave;cle attitude at the door, you'll have a ball.<br /><br />Regular readers will know I'm no great fan of 3D for the sake of it, but here I must say the 3D, and the animation generally, is continually impressive. I find myself rather fatigued by technological advances for the sake of it (well - it's shooting fish in a barrel: after all, there's not much you can't do with enough computer horsepower), but what impresses is the artfulness in which the technology is employed. The sweeping camera angles, clever use of perspective; the beautiful framing of every scene - the musical numbers particularly are brilliantly staged (for me to enjoy them, they'd have to be: I can't stand musicals). A bunch of Pentium processors won't give you that - but it's something Disney has always had a long suit in, and Tangled certainly measures up well against the studio's esteemed standards.<br /><br />In terms of characters, the cast are (to my limited outlook) relative unknowns and perform a workmanlike fashion, and are never allowed get in the way of the animated wizardry (which is how it ought to be in a Disney film). Mandy Moore does a fine job as Rapunzel; Zachary Levy had a little more trouble with Flynn Rider (or perhaps the character was just less appealing) and Donna Murphy seems to have come direct from Central Casting to play the role of Gothel but in any case all, and every other presence on the screen, was blown out of the water by Maximus, a centurion's horse, who was separated from his rider in a chase scene and made the most of his fifteen minutes of fame (they lasted an hour and a half, at any rate!). Somewhat galling, I dare say, for the voice actors to be outdone by an unvoiced animation, and he wasn't even the only one - there's a delightful running gag about a Marcel Marceau mime also!<br /><br />Look, it's not Citizen Kane, but if you're nostalgic for the sorts of films Disney used to make, and you're jaded by the world-weary attitude that seems to infect every \\"kids\\" movie in the digitally animated era, this one will be a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonwhat galling, I dare say, for the voice actors to be outdone by an unvoiced animation, and he wasn't even the only one - there's a delightful running gag about a Marcel Marceau mime also!

B002XMGGK6|3.0|\\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" stars Gerald Butler (\\"300\\") as Clyde Shelton, a genius engineer living in Philadelphia, whose wife and daughter are brutally murdered. The criminals Clarence and Rupert are caught, and the trial begins, but the prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) informs the distraught father that only Rupert will be sentenced to death. Clarence (with whom Nick strikes a deal) will be convicted of third-degree murder, which means in a few years he will be released from the jail.    You may call \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" a revenge thriller, but this time the angry protagonist avenges the deaths of his family in the most unpredictable (and brutal) fashion. He is not content with just killing; he intends to bring down the entire legal system of the country. That means Nick and those who are working with him (including Nick's mentor Jonas Cantrell played by Bruce McGill) are not safe ... even after Clyde is arrested.    Like his \\"The Negotiator\\" F. Gary Gray starts with a great premise, keeps a good pace in the mid-section, and then ends disappointingly, squandering the potential of the intriguing story. I know I shouldn't disclose the ending (don't worry, I won't), but frankly, the last 20 minutes are so impossible (even by the standards of Hollywood movies) that I still cannot believe what I have seen.    I like Gerald Butler. I like this kind of \\"vigilante\\" film. As for \\"Law Abiding Citizen,\\" however, four(or maybe five) stars for the first 60 minutes, one star for the ending.
1416509798|5.0|This book started off good, and just got better and better.  Overall, this was one of the most brilliantly constructed stories I have ever read.  Other reviewers have already outlined the plot, so I won't bother duplicating the effort.      If this tells you anything, this mother of 5 who works fulltime, read the 700 page book in 1 week.  In other words, even though I don't have any spare time, I couldn't put the book down.    Not only was the plot incredible but the descriptions of everything were beautifully poetic.    My only question about the plot was WHY Laura's father wanted her to marry Sir Percival????  Other than that, the plot held together quite well.    I highly recommend this book.  Definitely 5 stars.

OMG-we watched the entire 1st season in 1 day. We were absolutely hooked. I have to say that by far season 5 is its best! I hope that the unfortunate divorce between Michael Hall & Jennifer Carpenter does not affect the show in any way because I think she plays her part absolutely wonderfully! The chemistry that they have as brother and sister, and the inner workings of their messed up family, drives this show.

Having heard some of ZBB's biggest hits (chicken fried, toes, etc), I was hoping this album would produce some tunes to soothe my winter soul and transport me to a nicer and warmer place.  In this album my wishes were granted.  This album is everything I hoped for and more.  Each song is easy to sing along too and quite catchy, without being too commercial or contrived.  Overall, a great effort and number one on my most played list.
0812550706|5.0|I picked this up because I had seen it listed on numerous 'best of' lists in regards to not only science fiction, but coming of age stories.    I do commend the book for many of the same reasons, that the rules of the science fiction in question are well established and well followed, that the characters act consistently within the story to advance their own characters and the unfolding narrative that is their relationships with each other, and that the overall impending conflict does not overshadow any singular struggle within the story, but instead helps each to be seen as a firm stepping stone on the path to the final climax of the narrative.    Where this book rises above is that it is not the story of the everyman, the person who has hidden talents that are only brought out and explored because they are the chosen one, but instead that the main character is the smartest person on Earth, the youngest sibling of two of the other smartest people on earth.  This isn't a story about how we need to discover in ourselves the magic to save the day nonsense, this book is about those who have talent needing the strength and support to use it to its fullest, to not break applying their unstoppable intellect against the immovable ignorance of the world.  They are the best, they are the brightest, and the world needs them.  I feel this message is a good one, that sometimes it isn't the typical person who has to rise above, it has to be the exceptional person who defies expectations.    It is a spectacular book.  Read it.
B0032JTV6U|3.0|I have the DVD version of the Complete First Season, and there are serious issues with lip synchronization on several episodes.  This happens not just during the singing, but throughout the entire episode.  It makes watching the episode almost painful.  Very disappointing.
B003102JDM|4.0|I won't go into a lengthy diatribe about the plot; many have done that in other reviews.  If you enjoy offbeat, great movies (the Coen's are famous for this type of movie) that are dialogue driven and have subtle, often dark humor, you'll love a serious man.  We did.<br /><br />\\"When the truth is found, to be lies, and all the hope wihtin you dies . . . The Airplane
B003N5VOUO|5.0|This movie is excellent production and brings out the prejudices that exist in America and for that matter other parts of the world. The acting is excellent and was filmed in the U.S. I also understand that the actor who portrayed Kahn, was held up for four days, on his arrival in the U.S.  because of his ethnicity and possible religious beliefs.     The movie is moving and exciting and done in a very well produced format. The acting is excellent and the only drawback was the representation of President Obama was close but not a very good likeness to the real person. But after it is a movie.
B000002NFM|5.0|Relive the 90s with this fantastic album. Unlike a lot of albums from this era evry track is great from start to finish.
0385341679|5.0|I read this book via Kindle (first) and am waiting on my physical copy of the book. I am constantly awed by KMM and her story telling abilities. It has taken 5 years for us to fully grasp where Mac's story would end up. This book takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. I highly recommend this book, but also recommend that you read the first books in the series.
B001VNB54A|5.0|this Blu Ray DVD is very informative.  It has the historic footage from the war and it has the historians and the interview of the Marines that were there during WWII.    The movie does give you a different perspective of the war in the pacific from the war in Europe.  One is hell in tropics and the other is hell in the freezing winter.  It seems like the Marines had it worse, because the \\"Japs\\" never gave up the fight, at least the \\"krauts\\" Germans in Europe give up when they know they have lost the battle.
B0048ELDQY|5.0|Maybe it is partly because I have special feelings not only for quantum physics but for dogs as well. More seriously, I love the book because it teaches modern perspective on quantum physics and does it on the learners terms. The student in the book has very limited knowledge of formal (classical) physics, but she has a lot of imagination, some experience in practical mechanics (e.g. through chasing bunnies) and, what is important, she does not have many preconceived ideas. This is very much like a typical teenager. For teenagers learning about modern physics and especially for their teachers the book should be compulsory reading.
B0034G4P7Q|2.0|he Social Network is a boring movie about annoying people who'd impress with intellect but not with intelligence and it is set in a land where everything is brown.   Why?   Well because it is. That's cool...right?  In real life, Facebook is boring. It is the social pornography millions are addicted to where everybody posts pictures of all the parties they go to and beefcake or women they meet, but it's not a scene you can actually hook up on for real -- so strange. It is something I'll never understand. IMDb.com is cool. Who doesn't want to rate movies? But Facebook? Grow fake crops? Add friends? But no beer? Lame.   The Social Network is a dry, talky and lifeless odyssey about why we should care. Well, not really. A Lifetime TV movie in all but name, The Social Network chronicles the rise of the Facebook phenomenon and eccentricity of Mark Zuckerbeg, but it doesn't succeed in making the topic interesting. This is Real Genius but minus any actual dramatic investment or humor. David FIncher uses a deft deadpan touch and Trent Reznor funk to jazz it up, but the problem is, this is a movie about people making a website.    \\"I INVENTED FACEBOOK!\\" \\"NO WAY MAN, I INVENTED FACEBOOK!\\"  Yeah they do that for two hours. Oh the humanity. Puleeeez.  Jubilation over how many hits the website gets in The Social Network is simply not enough for me to be wowed by a bunch of hoodie geeks fighting over vaporware. But at least it does echo the millions of dorks (yeah that means all of you FB junkies) fighting over who is being friended or defriended in cyberspace by people they hardly, if ever talk to. It's true. The lower the stakes, the harder they fight.   If you identify this as being a symbol of your generation, then I feel sorry for you.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Loved it from start to finish. I do agree that the author did leave some questions unanswered. I am just hoping she wants to write another one. (I know it is suppose to be the end, but a girl can hope right? :)
193413712X|2.0|I really tried to get into this book, but about 1/3 way into the book, I found myself dreading picking up the book again, and finally just gave up.  I couldn't invest in any of the characters, and the two plotlines just didn't draw me in at all.  I can certainly see why others loved it, but I can't imagine how it could have won a Pulitzer.
B001E45XT4|4.0|this is a good product for the relatively low price. i bought it so i could chat over ArmA2 and it works great. the soft fabric is kinda itchy and this thing gets hot fast if your in a small room. it can feel pretty fragile at times especially during putting on and taking off. ive now used it for about 40+ hours and am satisfied with its overall use. i would say the bass is fairly unimpressive and i would like to try an amp with it but alas thats at the bottom of my to-do list. i will probably update my rating once i try it.
B0000E1WKE|3.0|I felt like it was a little to sexy for Christmas.  I like to sing along to Christmas songs, and I couldn't really do that with these versions.  Although, I loved Joy to the World and Who Would Imagine a King (I remember that from the Preacher's Wife CD).
B002ZG9968|5.0|Excellent Movie - came right on time. I LOVE J-Lo      5 Stars all the way! (smiles) - THANK YOU.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|The story is covered by other reviews.  I found the Single Disc Movie-Only Blu-Ray to be entirely satisfactory in picture and sound quality, with the constraint that I only have a very good 2.1 audio system and therefore cannot evaluate the surround sound features.  Buy with confidence, otherwise.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I missed a lot of this series when it came out but remembered liking it.  I'm only up to season three on DVD but it keeps me on my treadmill daily.  Fast paced, fun dialogue.  Very well written.
B003YCI1PM|5.0|My daughters adore Selena Gomez, and I bought this for my them, not knowing what to expect. I thought it would be another \\"kid\\" album, but I was very wrong. I was amazed at how mch Selen's voice has matured and is amazing! Not only that, the cd is incredible, there isn't one bad song on the entire album, the beats are very catchy, you cannot tire of this one. I can't say one negative thing about this cd, its that good and we listen to it all the time. I think i love her cd more than my kids , not to mention there is nothing in the songs that you would have to fear about unlike the other role models for today such as Britney and Gaga -- which are a shame. I wish there were more role models and more Cd's just like this one for our kids today. I will always support Selena Gomez in her music and career bc she truly defines classy in every way.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This is a good book.  At first it was a little hard to get into trying to remember all of the different characters but even the main character has trouble remembering everyone so throughout the book references are present to remind you of the relationship each character has in the story.<br /><br />I'm not what you would call an avid reader but this book kept me interested enough that I didn't want to put my kindle down.  Unfortunately the battery finally drained and forced me to plug it in so I took that as a sign to take a reading break.<br /><br />If your debating about getting the book, go for it!  You'll enjoy it. It's filled with mystery, suspense and drama.  It's not on the Best Seller's list for nothing. :) I'm looking forward to starting the next book in the series, \\"The Girl That Played With Fire\\".
B003XRZZFM|5.0|These guys just keep getting better and better over the years.  The production is highly refined on this album, lending a unique quality to composition and editing.  The guitars and orchestra complement each other perfectly driven by tight drums and ample bass guitar work.  Throw in an exceptionally dark theme, espeically for Dimmmu Borgir, and you've got something really special here. If you appreciate the way the band has progressed over the years this really is a culmination of what they've been trying to do.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|I had only read one other review for this and I highly agree with M. Mcallan's great review of it. It was what I was going to say in a nutshell. When I first learned they were going to make a remake of the 1978 classic I was a bit put off since most remakes are horrible. Especially great cult classics.  Anyone who hated the original has to remember it was banned because of the content. If you see the original now it will seem dated. But at the time if it was banned then it made it the more sought after. The remake did NOT dissapoint. In fact I would have to say this was the best remake I have seen of any movie in this genre. Lets be honest here, foreign horror movies are way better than anything hollywood could come up with now-a-days. So it is refreshing to see an american movie that was very well acted, executed, and had a message. YOU REAP WHAT YOU SEW!!!! This movie is not for everyone. It has very strong sexual themes and content so that should be expected going into it from the beginning. But it's right up my alley. If you like movies like Chaos, the last house on the left, and the Neihbor..than this is the movie for you.
B0042816YK|1.0|Julia Robert's character has no brain! That is the first thing that comes to mind, the story doesn't go into detail to explain to the audience why she is so unhappy as we the audience CANNOT find reason for her to BE UNHAPPY. Next ..it seemed as if she coudln't decide anything for herself, people were telling her what to do, what to feel..and its like she couldn't decide where or what to think or do...don't waste your time..the only thing nice about this crazy movie is that the scenery is beautiful but the character comes off as an unthankful woman who really doesn't have reason to jump around continents!
B000G6R7B8|5.0|You should know up front that this is a traditionally sized watch - 37mm case, smaller than is the fashion now.  That's good for people who prefer it, but not for people who want something larger such as some of the Hamilton Khakis.    Fine Quality for the price.  Good workhorse movement - for those who don't know, like all mechanicals and automatics it requires resetting occasionally, as they're not as accurate as a quartz movement.  And if you don't wear it daily, you'll have to reset the date if it's been sitting a while, or buy a watch winder.    The watch itself is very good quality, nice solid feel although not heavy like a larger watch.  The band is a matter of preference.  They look very good but are a little scratchy on the arm for some people's taste.  I may put a leather strap on it - brown would look great with this watch.    For some reason, field/military watches are priced higher than comparable normal watches - probably because there are a lot of collectors of them.  This is a good way to get a watch that's way better than, say, an LL Bean or Eddie Bauer field watch with a mechanical movement rather than quart.
0425220931|4.0|Vic Wooten takes a very creative approach to encouraging a correct mindset of skills a musician needs to consider in nurturing musical skills. This is beyond your standard musical instruction book, which typically sits on your shelf after the boredom of seeing the same musical scale referenced from the previous book purchased for the 100th time. This book focuses on bringing to the fore front musical concepts that get lost and ignored from years of bad habits and ignorance of focusing on playing faster and flashier, and ignoring vital ingredients that create inspiring music.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This book fits the kind of great read that we would expect from Brown. Just as  as perfect Da Vinci and A&D. I will admitt it was slow at times but it is an all around worthwile book.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This was a great movie, my kids and I loved it. It has meaning behind the storyline, and its touching. The comedic sense of humor is also pretty nice.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Just a hi-tech cable that lets you send video, audio and lots of other data (needed to make the TV communicate with cable/satellite feed or from the 3D TV multi-directional to the 3D Blue Ray).  Replaces the typical 3 blue, red and yellow cables used in previous technologies.  The LG 3D TV came with the HDMI; but the 3D Blue Ray (LG) did not.  You will need to buy a 2nd HDMI to connect the Blue Ray and the TV whether or not you get a 2D or 3D Blue Ray.  BTW.. the Dish installer said they charge $75 for a 6ft HDMI.  I got mine from Amazon a whole lot cheaper.
0307408833|4.0|I just had to write a review after reading so many negative ones. I have only made a few recipes from the book so far, but they have all come out perfectly. I have seen several complaints about not knowing to melt the coconut oil when measuring it for a recipe. If these readers had read the section on Ingredients in the beginning, it does say you need to melt it before measuring. When using unfamiliar ingredients, it is always a good idea to read the section the author has written about them. Also, yes coconut oil is expensive, but on the Babycakes website FAQ it does say you can use any other oil for the recipes, except for the frosting recipes. Substituting something cheaper like canola oil works just as well. You can also use evaporated cane juice instead of agave nectar as long as you add some water, the specifics of which are also discussed in the introduction section.     I think you will not be disappointed if you READ the whole Introduction section before trying to bake anything. It will tell you everything you need to know about the ingredients used.
B002FRNCG0|4.0|It is sometimes said that when a band gets signed, they pretty much have enough material for two albums already. So the distinction between a good band and a great band can fall on whether they're able to outdo themselves when they're faced with the foreign territory of that third record, having to write from scratch again. If that is indeed the case, Paramore is a great band.<br /><br />As it happens, I bought Brand New Eyes right at the same time that I found out Josh Farro (the band's guitarist who writes the instrumentations) and his brother Zac (the band's incredible drummer) had quit the band due to interpersonal difficulties. Listening to the album, I'm surprised it hadn't happened sooner! In hindsight it seems as though Hayley utilizes nearly every track on the record to viciously and succinctly tear Josh (her former boyfriend) to tiny little pieces (perhaps with good reason, I don't know). And it's thrice as vindictive as Fleetwood Mac's well known pop kiss-off via the Rumors LP, because here Hayley is the only one who gets to have her say, while Josh has to just sit back and play.<br /><br />I never thought Brand New Eyes would be able to match the incredible Riot! album. But all in all I would say they're about neck and neck. Riot! possesses the best hooks, while Brand New Eyes presents much more articulate and mature lyrics. They each present a solid selection of good songs and a handful of ultimate standouts for the band.<br /><br />Primarily what Brand New Eyes does is update Paramore's classic power-pop style with a slightly slicker and more mature aesthetic. The ultimate hookage of 'Ignorance' and 'Brick By Boring Brick' would have felt right at home on Riot!, while the more chugging pulse of 'Careful' and the ecstatic balladry of 'All I Wanted' could have sat alongside tracks on Paramore's debut All We Know Is Falling. That being said, Brand New Eyes easily scorches past Paramore's debut and sits next to Riot! as one of their greatest efforts.<br /><br />The hooks are slightly more subdued but still packing heat. The lyrics are incredibly thoughtful and uplifting, as Hayley effortlessly trounces the spiritual assaults she receives and vindicates herself with forceful abandon. Perhaps the most interesting track (although the hookiest is definitely 'Ignorance'), is the bombastic, catchy, and bittersweet 'Brick By Boring Brick,' where Hayley invites the protagonist to dismantle her fantasy world piece by piece. The song also lends the album its cover-art, as the protagonist's coming-of-age disillusionment manifests itself in the act of \\"tearing wings off of butterflies.\\"<br /><br />I originally put off getting Brand New Eyes for a while, because the track 'The Only Exception,' which is Paramore's most successful single, is also the single worst track the band has ever committed to record. When I first heard it, I was certain that Hayley must have released a solo album. Because other than her distinctive voice, the song sounds nothing like Paramore.<br /><br />The lyrics are decent but the song is doomed to banality by a molasses pace, uninspired instrumentation and perhaps the most boring chorus known to mankind. Furthermore the premise falls thin as Hayley sings of \\"vow[ing] to never sing of love\\" while 90% of her recorded discography does exclusively that. If I heard it done by GG Allin, Pink Floyd, Alice In Chains, or any band that doesn't predominantly write love songs, then I may have been impressed.<br /><br />But luckily the rest of the record shines bright enough to easily obscure its one faulty moment. And the band's other forays into foreign territory fare much better, namely the tender and folky 'Misguided Ghosts' which possesses an almost Petty-esque sense of world-weariness, and a CSNY-worthy command of folk guitar. All in all: With more than one truly great album, Paramore may be on their way into my personal pantheon.ore subdued but still packing heat.

B0036TGSIK|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed this movie, its a light fun comedy...and thats all it is. I loved the main character, she can act!
0316286850|5.0|I have had this book for about ten years and it taught me the basics of...well everything beauty. It gives you clear steps on how and why to apply all types of makeup. My two sisters and I have read it so many times that some of the pages have come loose but I will still keep it to reference it for years to come. The celebrity transformations are amazing! I never knew Courtney Love could look normal....    I would highly recommend this book to a person looking for guidance or maybe as a gift for the girl who over shapes her eyebrows (jk). It would also be helpful for a young teen new to make up.
031603438X|5.0|I suppose it would have been a melodramatic cliche for someone to write about Keith Richards as a shy, thoughtful man whose occasional proclivities forced him to live up to, or behind, a gargantuan image created by the world's press, but when you hear this secret truth revealed by the man himself over the space of a tome recounting 67 years of an amazing life, it makes for a poignant, revealing, sometimes horrifying, and always spellbinding read.  As a guy who has been playing guitar for almost 40 years myself, and playing in rock and roll bands for over have that time, there was as specific fascination to read the autobiography of one of my heroes, but even for people who just like memoirs of fascinating people, this book is worth the time, and will be compelling. Keith Richards has kept his feet on the ground, which can be inferred from his stark honesty about himself, and his examination of how great fame was thrust upon him, wasn't necessarily welcome, and how it affected his life and those of his compatriots in and out of the Rolling Stones.  Richards life has been a very large stone rolling forward and the early days obviously hold more contemplative meaning for him than the day-to-day living at this end of his life. It's not unexpected that the recollections of the early days of how he got where he is take up the bulk of his memoir, because he's as amazed as we are by the end result, considering all the negative and positive forces that were at work during the long career of the Stones. Although he is careful to address the veracity of all the legends, this isn't the entire story of the Rolling Stones, but it is Keith's version, and that's enough to make a spectacular book.
1594202842|1.0|This was the first Amazon book purchase I deeply regret. Amy Chua's writing is to Amy Tan (to whom she wishes to compare herself)as paper clips are to the Eiffel Tower. Tan writes with deeply layered, heart rending emotional rawness and award winning story telling skill. Chua's book left me wondering when an adult was going to step into the picture.....It never happened. Emotional maturity develops along very different lines than intellectual development. Skills sets can be learned ad nausuem with barely a hint of emotional adavancement, even despite emotional stunting. Her inability to refrain from rampant stereotyping of races and elitist tones won't win American readers over.<br /><br />Definitely taken aback by the incessant shallowness and disturbing lack of boundaries this woman has concerning where she begins and her children end. The writing style was reminiscent of a 15 year old high school girl blathering on Facebook. The quality never rose above that I'm afraid. Was truly surprised at how boring Chua is.... with such meager personal insight. She appears to equate manic instability, chronic verbal outbursts with a self-proclaimed Chinese-specific parenting style. I'm always appalled at women who use their children as human shields, pushing them into things the mother is afraid to do herself....in the name of 'my children's performance is a reflection on me.'<br /><br />When referring to Confucius, I'm guessing she is unaware Confucius was adamantly opposed to the education of Chinese women, stating they belonged in the kitchens and farm fields. I'm using this book to prop up my house plants. My grandparents and parents met at Duke University.
B004G6009K|5.0|I looooved this movie and my kids loved it even more! This is destined to become a classic for all times, the storyline will suck  you right in, and the humor is too cute. Kids of any age will enjoy it, i loved every single character except the stepmother of course! Can't wait to own my copy, great job Disney and can't wait for your next masterpiece to come out!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Shadowfever is everything fans were hoping for with elements that blow past expectations to take readers on a wilder and more intricately stunning ride that they ever could have dreamed.<br /><br />This is going to be one of the hardest reviews I've ever had to write. Initially I will say to readers of this review that Shadowfever is not a standalone read. The power and gripping effect of finally getting answers along with Mac, the heroine, can only be accomplished by reading all the other books in the series first. For readers who have read everything, probably more than once, this book does justice to the pomp and hype of its release.<br /><br />I'll start off with Mac. She's been through a lot of emotional upheaval throughout this journey and it's not over yet. She is still making discoveries; some will scare her, some will break her heart and some will mortify her. Betrayal and redemption come from unexpected forces and through it all she has friends that stick by her. Some even want to kill her even while working with them. It's a rickety kind of truce and a reader never knows which way it will go. I still like Mac. I respect her character and her drive. I adore her quirky humor and her mixed and volatile feelings for the sinister and delicious Jericho Barrons. I am impressed that she never quit even when she was faced with the possible truth of her origins. Get ready for a revelation that at first seems the truth; but then Ms. Moning injects doubt and new possibilities only to top it off with a reality I never in my wildest dreams could have seen coming.<br /><br />Remember Dani? The speedy kid with a heroic bent? A reader will never see it coming. I didn't. The use of the bulletin pages from Dani was an interesting addition to how Ms. Moning told this tale. It was like reading the National Enquirer on steroids without grammar control. It captured her personality well.<br /><br />And Darroc, the LM, the bad guy? He's a big contributor of information to Mac's goals. It's how Mac gets that information that was a bit surprising and disturbing. Again, a reader is in for a new twist in this tale and it's gripping.<br /><br />As a reader is probably aware, Mac has never liked Rowena though I give her credit for trying. Remember Ro? She's the head of Haven and always seemed to have it in for Mac. Ms. Moning made it very easy for me to dislike that woman all along but in this book, the reasons are cemented. Wait until you get a load of her version of the truth. I was so angry.<br /><br />As for V'lane, the fae I vacillated between trust and liking, and being wary and unsure of throughout the series - Wow, I am in awe. I'm not saying another thing other than he is way more than this little mind could have comprehended or conjured. Way to go, Ms. Moning!<br /><br />The best part about Shadowfever is that I finally get to see my romantic hopes come to fruition. It took long enough, sheesh! But was it worth it? Oh yes, absolutely. Why? Because the raging passion and heartfelt emotions were so poignant and violent they left a lasting impression. There is no doubt that Mac's love is reciprocated but not in a way conforming to a reader's expectations. It's unique to this story and the character that returns it. Notice I'm not saying who. I'm not saying when. By the time the ride comes to a full stop and a reader can release all safety bars and harnesses, it's practically the happy ever after that I wanted for Mac but better.<br /><br />But what's with that tease that Ms. Moning threw in? I can only think of two words -- The Keltars. I'm doing the happy dance because I got to read a terrific book that will stay with me, literally on my keeper shelf, but I am sure I found a hint that those hunky druids will be back. I am a happy reader and I thank Ms. Moning for an astonishingly well-written and exciting experience with characters that confound and amaze throughout a story like no other, and a book that showed that emotions run deeper than anyone ever anticipated.<br /><br />Shadowfever is a masterpiece, the cherry on top of a sundae, the frothy cream on top of a mocha delight; it's all of that and more. This book has adventure, great dialogue, excitement and the solving of an age old mystery. The answers to much of the oftentimes asked questions are finally revealed and I couldn't be happier. Mac is happy and so am I. This is a must read - simple as that.<br /><br />Originally posted at The Long and Short of It Romance Reviewsece, the cherry on top of a sundae, the frothy cream on top of a mocha delight; it's all of that and more.

1594202842|5.0|I am going to come at this book from a different perspective, because with 200 reviews, it's all been said before. Yes, any parent can stay on top of their children and force them to study to the point of absurdity. Read the biographies of Norbert Weiner Ph.D. Harvard at 18 years of age, or Albert Einstein, and you will learn about 2 individuals acknowledged to be incomparable intellectuals, both of whom were miserable in their personal lives.<br /><br />In this case the author Amy Chua has perhaps battered her children into academic brilliance but at what cost to them? The ancient Greeks said that life had to be lived in balance on four levels:<br /><br />* Spiritually<br /><br />* Emotionally<br /><br />* Intellectually<br /><br />* Physically<br /><br />These children are not living a balanced life, and it seems unlikely that they ever will. What about the concept of finding and living your bliss? The author is a very special person, and reveals the true core of the book in the first 50 pages when she talks about herself as a Harvard trained lawyer working in a prominent Wall Street law firm daydreaming about other things while working on contracts at 1 AM in the morning. This really says it all for me.<br /><br />Do you want to be a miserable doctor looking to do something else, or do you want to be a doctor that loves what you are doing. The vast majority of people in our society are not doing what they love. They are settling for less than what they can be. There are then those of us, who find, absolutely find what they were born to do, and those are the fortunate ones. I heard Michael Jordan, admittedly the greatest basketball player ever, state that when he left the Chicago Bulls the first time, he continued to play basketball in the inner cities in pick up games in school yards to keep in shape. What amazed him is that he found guys who were postal employees, fedex drivers, and UPS delivery people who were COMPETITIVE to him on the court. They just never had the chance to go pro. What a God given waste of talent, and that it what this book is about. It doesn't matter what the children want; it's what the mother wants.<br /><br />I thought this book was fabulous, because in many ways it told me everything I don't want to do as a parent. I don't want to force my will on my children. The year Robert Kennedy died in 1968 while campaigning for the Presidency that would take his life, he was asked a question. What do you want for your children? I was 17, and still remember his answer. Perhaps that they should be well-adjusted.<br /><br />The author's children not well-adjusted, and if this is where they are at this stage, I am frightened for their future. As for the comparative values of Chinese upbringing versus our way of life, it's very simple. People are breaking down the doors to come to America, including the author's parents. Nobody is breaking down the doors to become a citizen of China. America is the only country in the world that renews itself through immigration. We bring in more people and make them citizens of the United States each year, than the rest of the world COMBINED. Doesn't this tell you something? We are doing something right. Finally, the whole planet wants to come to America and go to our colleges and graduate schools. It's not the other way around.<br /><br />There's one more vital observation I would like to make. The people that run the planet, that create the innovations that change the world, and rule Wall Street, are not the guys and gals with the A average out of Harvard or anywhere else. They are the B players with massive communication skills that can run teams, groups and empires. All the studies show this. The A students in the end work for the B players who can talk, and work their will in the market place. China made it on organizing tens of millions of people and getting them to work for 18 cents an hour. You can't compete against 18 cents. When I asked them how they get someone to work for 18 cents? The answer is we can't get them to work for 15 cents.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Mrs. Chu comes from a family where three sisters went to Harvard, Yale and UC Berkeley, and between the three there were two lawyers and one doctor. She then marries a Jewish man who is also Harvard law. Now anybody in the CIA will tell you that the Jews and the Chinese are the smartest people in the world genetically. In fact in the CIA, the Chinese are referred to as the Jews of the Orient. Why should anyone be surprised that the author's children have done so well? My only qualm is that perhaps had she had the willingness to allow them to find their own way, she would have produced happier children, who will not express animosity towards the forced upbringing they were taught to embrace. When love is withheld unless you do what I tell you to do, you have a tough situation with a lot of emotional baggage that will be lugged around for a long time. In this case a lifetime - 2 lifetimes. Thank you for reading this review.<br /><br />Richard C. Stoyeckrk for 15 cents.

B002QKZLZ6|4.0|What can I say; it does what it says-it'll hold your earpiece when not in use. I shove it in the glovebox and forget it. No way I'd wear it on my belt!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|i fell in love wth this book by page 10. its fast paced and action packed. it also is probably going to be made into a movie this year :)  very happy making
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Wow. What a book. Just goes to show things aren't always black and white, but that there are many shades of gray in between.<br /><br />The story centers around Victor Frankenstein, a brilliant scientist, who creates life in his laboratory. Driven by an insatiable desire to bring back the spark of life, he is disgusted and repulsed by his final creation and casts the creature out. This hideous being, denied even the smallest show of kindness or love, pleads with his creator for a symbol of compassion. Again denied, the monster turns against his maker and a life and death struggle ensues.<br /><br />When I turned the final page (or clicked onto the final page), I was left wondering: Who is the real monster?
B004FLIXVS|5.0|Great record, though not the complete Pearl Jam concert experience, simply because they didn't want to include any of the songs from their last official live release - Live on Two Legs (1998) - which included many of their live staples, like Even Flow, Daughter, Better Man, Corduroy, and Small Town. But still, this is an amazing collection of songs and anyone who has the slightest interest in Pearl Jam needs to pick it up, along with Live on Two Legs if you don't already have it.
1401310400|1.0|I can't say anything about the story of the book because the print is so small it would not be enjoyable to read!
0439023513|2.0|First of all, the first two books were great! Of coarse you have to read this book if you have read the first two.  I finished all three books in about 4 days...They are very quick reads and very entertaining.  But I thing many of the reviews that are 5 and 4 stars are by either die hard fans who wont admit the obvious horrible ending or they are giving a review on the whole series.  My 2 stars are for mockingjay, not the whole series.  The authors writing weaknesses are very apparent in mockingjay.  Spoilers follow, so this review might be for the disappointed who have already read this book...trust me i feel your pain.  Following are my dislikes about the book.    1) And most importantly, Katniss never seemed to make any decisions for herself.  She was always someone elses mockingjay never her own.  She was always reacting to someone else, never for herself.  So unfortunately she was never a hero...she only lived up to others expectations as the face of the revolution.    2) She chose Peta kind of by default...there was no real climax in their relationship, it was kind of like, well Gale might of killed my sister, he is gone, Peta is still here, so Hi...have my children.  We as readers had to suffer through pages of not knowing (well, kind of not knowing, I always hoped it would be Peta.) and all we get is \\"I guess you will do.\\"    3) Katniss' killing of Coin and the death of Snow was a pure cop out...it was like Collins ran out of time, or imagination...I can thing of 5 other endings that would be lightyears better than hers...    4) Collins killed of some really good characters that didn't need to die and all i was left thinking was \\" why did you kill prim and finnik?\\" it was like, once again, she ran out of time and didn't want them to continue on in the story because she would have to come up with a back story for them too.  Also, they died in really unhonorable ways.    5) it bugged me that plutarch was like \\"what i wouldn't do for some of earths old technology like a satellite.\\"  when he said that in the book i was dumfounded.  They can genetically modify everything, have colosseums that can change, and have invisible hovercrafts....really?...seriously?     So, yes i am a bit cynical about the ending.  Why? Well, after putting in so much time in reading the books, and enjoying them very much, I would expect the series to end well.  As you can tell, I am not happy at all with the ending.  It was my hope that Katniss would find her 'inner mockingjay' and take control of herself and the revolution...instead we are kind of left with her living with her ghosts.
B00280LYHS|5.0|i absolutly loved this entire book and series. Percy Jackson and his friends adventures are extremly thrilling at parts. I have read it twice and found myself as excited reading it the 2nd time as i did the 1st. I would most definetly recomend it.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|People! All you negative reviewers; did you read and then try the section regarding the 15 minute orgasm? My word, I've been having sex since I was 17 and now at 58 years of age, Ferriss's book has turned decent sex with my wife into a revelatory experience of feel good joy! Try it, you'll like it! Granted, his writing style is a bit disjointed, but this guy is trying to show you how to git'r'done in not only sexual matters, but in diet and exercise as well. The jist  of his approach is this: what is the \\"minimum effective dose?\\" How much exercise, vitamin intake, food intake does it take to lose weight? I have been blindly doing several of his suggestions for the last 3 years and his \\"research\\" confirmed for me the direction that I have been taking. Before Ferriss, I lost 35 pounds. Now I'm fine tuning diet and exercise according to his suggestions. This book isn't \\"War and Peace,\\" nor is it meant to be. Take what you need and let the rest of it go! And don't forget to read and then DO the part about sex!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This is such a fantastic finish to a great series.  It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the book. It answered all the questions that had been raised in the other books of the series and had a great finish.
0385523912|5.0|This book had a profound effect on me. Like many, I came to this book with little knowledge of North Korea, aside from what is on the news. And that's no accident, the country is highly secretive. This is what makes Demick's book so groundbreaking. By interviewing six defectors Demick is able to offer an unprecedented look into the lives ordinary people live in this communist dictatorship.<br /><br />The stories in this book present a country where millions suffer from miserable deprivation. People are starving, reduced to eating grass and tree bark. Most of the country no longer has electricity. Pervasive malnutrition has collectively stunted the country's growth.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the North Korean government offers a program of constant brainwashing, requiring constant supplication to the leadership. Detractors are sent to gulags, as are their relatives. The government practices a policy of \\"tainted blood,\\" suggesting that any malcontent had tainted the blood of their family by three generations, meaning that grandparents and grandchildren are also undesirables needing eradication.<br /><br />Demick's care and persistence in collecting these stories is admirable. Even more so is the courage of these North Koreans to tell their stories. Their families have faced retribution for their decision to leave. It is truly astonishing the level of isolation and brainwashing that the government has managed to accomplish. This is important reading for everyone. Such shocking human rights abuses must be made public.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I just finished Shadowfever. Let me just say \\"WOW\\" I love the her (Karen) I could not put this book down, unfortunatey work got in the way,a lot. Every time I thought I had the book figured out it went in a different direction.I will say if people that have not read the series this is the time to read them(in order). Book 3&4, the cliff hangers were brutal !!!!!!! To say I almost didn't recover is an understatement. Had to wait a whole year for Karen to write the next! It's ok cause I LOVE HER! I'm ready for the next installment.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I will agree with all the positive reviews about this show.  It had me hooked after the 2nd show and I look forward to Gods of the Arena. The second season of \\"Spartacus\\".    I will just add that the story telling, character development, and infinite sub plots are all top notch. Unlike other TV shows, this one has sub plots that actually end.      Story doesn't grow beyond itself where viewers tune out due to the lack of direction. (i.e. Heroes)
B000FC0OOU|5.0|I have just finished reading the Kindle edition of \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\" In this book, Hemingway speaks from the point of view of a third person omniscient narrator, that is, the narrator sees into the minds and emotions of all the characters from whose point of view the story unfolds.  In this way Hemingway demonstrates his genius for having accurate and sensitive insight into the human spirit.      I am impressed by the way he is able to express passion, especially in the sex scenes, under the constraints of early 20th century censorship.  I read this book simultaneously with Sandra Brown's \\"Hello Darkness,\\" reading six chapters of Hemingway to every five chapters of Brown so that I would finish both books at the same time.  This truly provided a contrast of how human passions were expressed in early 20th century novels compared with how they are expressed today.  You should try it!  It's an eye-opener!  What some would judge as repetitive prose in Hemingway was actually a literary device he used to bring the reader into the experience, and in my opinion (and of course, the opinions of countless other readers and critics) Hemingway succeeds famously. I also found it very amusing to read how Hemingway skirted around the expression of \\"unprintable\\" language, a hindrance contemporary authors no longer need to be concerned about <g>    Another device Hemingway uses in this novel is to make his characters \\"think\\" in Spanish but \\"speak\\" in English.  This is not easy to accomplish successfully.  Because I am bi-lingual, I found the rhythm of the prose quite natural, but I wonder how the experience would be for an only-English speaking reader.    This is my second Hemingway novel and I am so grateful that I have been introduced to Hemingway on Kindle. Because I read this on Kindle for PC, I was able to conveniently and quickly look up not only the definitions of words I did not know but also the translations of Spanish phrases with which I was unfamiliar.  Thank you,Kindle!  It made reading this book much more interesting and informative.  It has also spurred an interest in the history of the Spanish Revolution which took place in the decade before I was born.  Of course, Kindle has satisfied that curiosity as well.    This is more than a worthwhile read for anyone who enjoys war novels.  One learns so much from reading; I've always said fiction is the best medium for speaking truth, and Truth (whatever that means to each one individually) abounds in this book.  Enjoy!
0833524658|1.0|I know many people love this book, but I am definitely not one of them.  I almost like the sing-song refrain (\\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always...\\"), but when I read this book, I can't help thinking the mother should be institutionalized. Crawling across her son's floor?  Stalking her adult son? Really!  And even that refrain, \\"as long as I'm living my baby you'll be\\"--isn't she supposed to raise her son to be an adult, not her \\"baby\\"?  I read this book to my son a few times, but it has since been put away.  It gives me the creeps.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|my son loves the soothie pacifier on the monkey. and i think the monkey is just adorable. it's easy to clean since all you have to do is either put it in the washer on gentle cycle and air dry it afterwards OR dip only the soothie part for a few seconds in boiling water. this is awesome when i bundle him up and it just lays next to him or on top of him. he's almost 3 months in a few days and he still doesn't know how to control his arms and fingers. so when he isn't bundled he tends to accidentally grab the monkey and pulling the soothie out of his mouth or knocks it off. he gets himself really frustrated and i end up having to keep putting it into his mouth several times. hopefully when he gets older and learns to coordinate his arms and hands that he'll be able to hold it and keep it in his mouth.
044022425X|5.0|Diana Gabaldon continues to keep  me rivetted to her time-spanning story.  It's impossible to put down, however, I find I'm pacing myself because I just don't want it to end.  Her charachters come to life on each page, and you are watching the story, not just reading it.  Can't wait to get the next in the series!
044656740X|2.0|This book is good as a motivational reference, but I would hazard to guess that it wasn't written to actually make other people rich.  Mr Kiyosaki provides questionable facts (a little online research shows this) to back up his statements, but no concrete way of actually duplicating his success.  Some of the other books in his series are much better in this respect, but are still often filled with duplicate information and other extraneous details.    Overall, skip this unless you need a pep talk.
B003L77TZI|5.0|This is a great CD, lots of fun and great songs. Katy Perry is unbelievable! Her hit singles off of this CD are Firework, California Girls, Teenage Dream, but other songs are great, too. Well worth the money! I'm a huge fan of hers!
B0036EH3U2|1.0|I refuse to buy this until they include the \\"Face of the Enemy\\" webisodes!!! It is unforgivable that they are not included, especially since what happens in them is so crucial to understanding Gaeta's character.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Simply put, if you like the Beatles, then you should get this box set.  I surprised my wife with it and her eyes almost popped out of her head, there is so much content and extras that it'll keep you busy for a while.  Also the quality of the audio is so much better than downloading online.  I mean if you have the choice of buying the iTunes version or the box for the same price...get the box!!!!

0385341679|5.0|Wow! Loved this book and the author did a great job of tying up all of the loose ends.  I am disappointed that the series has come to an end but I look forward to her future books.

B004EQAVHI|4.0|I will not attempt to explain the plot of the film, since so many others have already done so.  I will simply say that I was quite taken with NEVER LET ME GO  when I saw it at a Toronto Int'l Film Festival industry screening.  It's a beautifully rendered story that seems fictional today, but may well play out in a frighteningly realistic way at some point in the future.  I don't know about others, but I found a bunch of bio-ethical questions swirling around in my head as I watched the film, on matters such as cloning, stem cell research, selective breeding of humans, etc.  I've generally held very progressive views on many of those issues, but NEVER LET ME GO really compelled me to rethink my positions.  I walked away from the film wondering: How far is too far in the name of science?  Where should we morally draw the line in our efforts to eradicate disease or extend the lives of people?  All interesting questions.  This beautiful little drama (that nobody saw) interrogates those questions and more in really heartbreaking ways.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|!YES!,I have seen the original and it was a good movie but for me it does not have alot of replay value unlike LET ME IN,This movie takes my breath away everytime i've watched it and i have seen it almost nine times while it was in theaters so i can safely say i know every inch of this movie in detail.I dare say this is one of the best movies ever made and if it was not a remake i would have expected this movie to receive an oscar in at least one catergory,This is my advice to anyone who is a movie lover this is definitely a movie you must see before you die.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|This will be short and sweet. I watch the movies because of the books, we all know no movie will compare exactly to the book, so i will not even waste time with that thought. I will say that this was a good movie with good effects. My favorite part was the fight scene. It was also one of my favorite parts of the book, so for me to say that for the movie says a lot to me. There were some things that were a little to fake and i wont spoil any scenes so you will have to watch it for yourself. Overall it was a good movie and i hope that Breaking Dawn will be more like the book since it will be in two movies. I will say that if you are debating on buying the movie you should probably rent it first or borrow it first, then decide if you liked it well enough to buy. If i had not read the books i'm not sure i would have bought the movies, but i always buy movies that i own the books to.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|from the first scene in the bar till the last images, you'll feel as if you're seeing the problems with facebook. a witty, intelligent social study on human interactions. what makes a friend? how is it that you lose one? and how you can have as many \\"friends\\" yet be so alone. all those cuandaries will be in store in this amazing movie that will surely have to win the oscar for best picture. some feel that director fincher has soften himself and sell himself, but i dissagree. fincher is focusing in the same problems and cunundrums that makes human iteraction from \\"seven\\", \\"fight club\\", \\"benjamin button\\" to \\"the social network\\", we see characters that will remind us of each of us and asks us the question \\"what you should have done?\\"...it is a marvelous picture were the periferical sight also adds to the story and is a visual gem. the screenplay is amazing and engaging and will feel as if you are seeing real life and not a movie. amazing performances will add to this little box that holds a punch that will leave you breathless. add it to your collection, is a must!
0307456625|5.0|This is the first book that I read of Alexander Smith and I am delighted. What you should know: this book is actually a series of short detective stories told about a smart African woman, Precious Ramotswe. It is humorous and endearing. I have not found much humor in detective novels, but this book has it.  It is not a thriller or a CSI type detective novel. She does not use computers, fingerprints or any other scientific methods. She just uses common sense, a great memory and understanding of people.  The emphasis of this book is how the woman becomes a detective and how she notices everything and manages her cases. There are delightful, interesting descriptions of the people around her. You learn about African customs of her country and surrounding areas. You learn about the \\"feel\\" of the place. None of this information is ever overwhelming - you get just enough information to get a sense of the circumstances.  I found I had to keep reading up one of the mini-cases was solved and then I could put the book down for a while and take it back up.  I fell in love with Mme. Ramotswe, I fell in love with the land, even the open dry bleak areas.   This is the first novel in what is now a long list of novels with Ramotswe as the detective. I know that I will be ordering more.  I found this first novel at a second hand book sale so that if I did not like it, I was not losing much money. I recommend that you do the same so that you know for sure if you like this type of detective novel.
B003629IPW|4.0|I loved this video, part one, showing Michael rehearsing.  What was missing, however, was the song THis IS It.  Go figure...  Also, the second video was about the technical aspects of the production, and wasn't very interesting.
B00000IBRI|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater in 1985.  It starts out a little slow, inserting scenes that may make you wonder what they have to do with the overall story, but slowly builds a suspenseful momentum that will have you wondering up until the shocking moment the monster is revealed.  And believe me, this moment is shocking.  After the mirror scene, as I call it, the movie begins to make sense as all the past clues come together.  If you want to watch a shocker movie, this is definitely one you should have on your shelf.  Five Stars!
B001NLKT60|3.0|The story was good but it took along time to get the point across a bit of a disappointment with all the hype.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Wow, pretty easy to spot the people who just hate for the sake of hating.     Pretty predictable really, years back \\"corporate rock\\" was the slander thrown at any group that was popular. The obvious logic being that if you were popular and many people enjoyed your music? -- Well, you just HAD to be a \\"Sell Out\\" aka \\"corporate rock\\"     Now enter Nickelback, they become wildly popular and, yup, there's something wrong with that.     I read thru all the 1 Star\\"reviews\\" and, at the risk of committing the same crime, with hardly any exceptions they are all written by people who don't own the album (I Do Own it) haven't heard it (I have) but their reviews are more about hating success, hating music in general or rock music less generally or (and I love this) those who protest the use of \\"bad\\" language. These are the same people who buy tickets to porn movies and complain about being \\"offended\\" by what they saw. If you KNOW you don't/won't  like it ? Dont buy it, don't get a ticket, don't listen to it, change the channel.     They fail to actually review the MUSIC and instead write a diatribe on what's wrong with the world (this is the sin I now share) the music part has been well reviewed and there is little I can do to add to the good information out there already. What I felt I Could Do, was give NB another 5, and comment on the stupidity I saw.      This ain't twitter or facebook people.
0307271862|3.0|The Man from Beijing is a Mankell novel in which Kurt Wallender never makes an appearance. The protagonist here is rather an unlikely one, being a 50-something Swedish woman who happens to be a highly regarded judge. A shocking mass murder has occurred in a remote northern village populated by elderly people, most of whom are related. When Birgitta discovers that the foster parents of her mother are among the dead, she travels to the scene of the crime to find out what the police know. Within days, they've arrested a suspect, but Birgitta's experience tells her they've got the wrong man.<br /><br />From here on out, the book jumps between time periods and places. From 19th century China and America, to 20th century China, and to present day China, Africa, and England, Birgitta tracks the history behind the horrendous crime. The 19th century segments, depicting the dismal lives of Chinese peasants as they work to build America's railroads, are interesting, but thereafter the writing sinks into a dry essay into the workings of modern Chinese financial and political problems. True, some of the details have direct bearing on the mystery plot, but it takes way too long to distinguish what they are. The action picks up again when Birgitta returns to Sweden, and realizes that she's the target of whoever perpetrated the mass murder.<br /><br />If this book had been ruthlessly edited, perhaps it could have matched the tension inherent in the Wallender series. Regrettably, it wasn't, and readers should be prepared to slog through the politics before the mystery is solved.
0061122416|3.0|I picked up THE ALCHEMIST because of all its critical acclaim.  Years ago, I had read VERONIKA DECIDES TO DIE by the same author and enjoyed it, so I was already familiar with his style of writing.<br /><br />I started reading THE ALCHEMIST and, as I read, I thought that it would make a great animated film that would appeal to and teach moral lessons to children and adults alike.  I was intrigued by the possibilities, the moral lessons, and symbolism that this fable had to offer.<br /><br />About halfway through, though, the pace seemed to change.  It was as if the author gave up on the story and just wrote for writing's sake to draw out the short novel's length.  By the end, I didn't care for (or still know much about) the characters.  It no longer felt like it was progressing as rapidly for me.  The symbolism was waning, the religious undertones were increasing, and the feats of incredible/impossible/unrealistic happenings were growing.  Metaphors were no longer metaphors.  They were actually taking place.<br /><br />The ending was predictable, as was its moral lesson, and I was glad when it finally reached its anticlimactic finale.  Sadly, the book with extreme potential lost its flair and didn't know how to get it back.

B00337KM2S|4.0|Jason Reitman, like his famous father, is able to take even the most preposterous setup and turn it into an entertaining film with a keen eye for the human condition.  Ryan (George Clooney's character) flies about the country working for a firm that fires people.  This is somewhat of a gimmick - Reitman even filmed actual employees who had been downsized, asking them to re-enact their behavior when they were fired (or even to act as they \\"in hindsight wished they would have acted\\"), and there are some genuinely noble and passionate observations to be made in these scenes.  In a lesser movie, Ryan would merely serve as the witness to their tragedies.  Instead, we are invited into the world of transients that Ryan inhabits - one of airports, 2-hour friendships with the guy sitting next to you on the flight - and Ryan's sharp observations on the fundamental isolation of human beings give us the first layer of the film.    The second layer is provided by the three women in Ryan's life - the woman next door with whom he has a \\"neighbours with privileges\\" arrangement, a fellow frequent flyer with whom he has \\"frequent flyer privileges,\\" and a young new co-worker who is trying to make his job obsolete.  I'm sure the first woman would not even be mentioned in most reviews, but her part, albeit small, is critical to the plot.  When Ryan comes home (to a souless apartment he sleeps in only 50 days of the year) his neighbour pops by for a chat.  It's clear that they have been sexual partners, but Ryan immediately back off when she tells him she's \\"seeing somebody now.\\"  This is what establishes our sympathy for Ryan - he is essentially moral, unlike the sleazy bosses he is surrogate for.    That leaves the other two women free to serve as Ryan's antagonists.  Alex is a fellow frequent-flyer and business woman with whom he has an explicit agreement to meet up with for sex whenever their travel schedules overlap.  She states at the outset that she is just as independent and shackle-free as Ryan, but implies otherwise in numerous conversations that follow.  The unfortunately named Natalie Keener is the keen new co-worker aiming to revolutionize the business by eliminating the need to travel and enabling her and Ryan's company to save millions in airfare.  That this would destroy Ryan's way of life immediately sets him against her, but he smartly frames it as a professional discussion about how badly the company would fare if they became just another cheap hatchet-job operation.  Natalie sets off with Ryan to see \\"how the job is done,\\" and the three of them (Ryan, Natalie, and Alex) form a kind of triumvirate trolling the airport hotels.  Their conversations on life, love, and commitment form the actual heart of the movie - Ryan cynically independent, Natalie the the traditional romantic (talking and texting her boyfriend every night, having rejected offers from the most prestigious law firms in the big city to follow him to his new job in Kansas), and Alex occupying the middle ground as a sort of mediator.    We are now at the 2/3 mark of the film and all is well.  Unfortunately, either from studio pressure or through some sort of internal need for closure, Reitman allows the film to drift off into a more standard cookie-cutter resolution.  I'm okay with the fact that Natalie is given a closed story-arc because her character is designed for that purpose.  I'm okay that Ryan shows her up in a great scene of redemption where he notices something about the man he's firing that allows him to give the fired man hope and promise for a more satisfying life.  Again, I can forgive this scene as it is so well acted and contains such humanity (and because the fired man is played by Reitman's good-luck charm J.K. Simmons).  What I can't forgive is the whole-hearted and sudden transformation of Ryan from lone wolf to den-mother and the resolution of his relationship with Alex.  It's not so much the resolution itself, but the fact that the relationship was resolved that left me unsatisfied.  It's almost like it came from a different, more conventional movie, and it discolours all the events preceding it in such a way that it even spoils the film's re-watchability.  I wish Reitman would have taken a note from Sophia Coppola's playbook - we don't hear what Bill Murray's character says at the end of \\"Lost in Translation\\" because it would ruin the rest of the film (no matter what was actually said).    So we're left with a film that is excellent for about 3/4 of the time.  The good news is that most films are never good, and I'm thankful for those 3/4.  So I rate this film a 4/5 mainly because it let me down at the end with what I consider to be an artificial resolution.  For those buying the DVD, the director's commentary is actually fairly entertaining, and shows Reitman to be a thoughtful and interesting filmaker, and I look forward to his next project.

1932100660|5.0|I find The China Study educational and provocative. I'm changing my eating habits and lifestyle after reading several good books; all of which coincide with one another. We must take steps to be responsible for our own health since the medical community and health fields are not teaching us about these studies thinking most of us won't change our eating habits. This at least gives us a chance!
B003NFM3JU|4.0|The 3d was pretty good. The story is what it always is with this movie. Nothing too great. I would get a used copy if you could as I don't think the money is worth it on a new copy. You'll watch the movie once or twice a year during the holidays until they make a new format.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|What a Great end, but it left me wanting more of all of them! Barrons, Mac and the New life they are ready to venture on! Thanks so such a great end to the Fever!
B002RKRTGO|1.0|This version is missing certain passages, as with other Kindle editions of Sherlock Holmes books. Any time something is read in the story, such as from a newspaper or a letter, it is missing. There are also illustrations found in the original that are missing. As a substitute, I downloaded the Google version of the book on my phone, the picked back up on the Kindle. This makes me hesitant to ever purchase Kindle editions for fear of the same issues.
030746363X|1.0|There is another review in here that says it better than I do, but it is weirdly obvious when you read through the book that he contradicts himself.  One times it's this, another time it's that.  He says, \\"This is the only exercise you need!\\" and then later gives a full workout plan with more exercises.  He references so many people who do so many things that it's certain that some of their methods would overlap and/or contradict.  Dangerous stuff.    It's also kind of funny how pleased with himself he is throughout the book.  Yes Tim, we understand that you know best, that there is a ton of info out there that you can prove wrong.  I also know from personal experience that a person can gain a ton of muscle mass in a short time, just by training hard and smart.  But he's also a tiny little guy who has some interesting mental issues, and no matter how much he tries to learn to jump, he's not that impressive.  The guys he CONSTANTLY references spend a big part of their lives in gyms and in training, too, which goes against his entire philosophy.      Do we really need to hear about Tim's dates?  C'mon!  For a guy who has written two books about how awesome he is, I really don't want to read about how women like him.    He states in his other book that he advises Olympians.  So why does he always need help from professional coaches?  That's curious.  Oh wait, because he is a con man.    He also overlooks one major, major thing.  How about finding exercise that you like to do?  Something that makes you feel good, and allows you to define fitness as you see fit?  Instead of spending a short time in the gym to bulk up your little frame, how about trying things like body-weight training, yoga, and pilates to stay happy and fit?  I like all those things and look forward to doing them.  Exercise can be as much about personal goals and mental contentment than gaining muscles in a short time.  He misses the point.      One last thing.  He made an unregulated supplement calledBrainQuicket (worst name ever) and sold it.  For a guy who sold an unregulated upper and then \\"stretches\\" the truth about a lot of things, I'll hold off taking advice about my own physical health.  His major themes - MORE, NOW, FAST! - can have harmful long-term consequences.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I finished the series....maybe, according to KMM.  Love this series! One of my all time favorites!  Love Ireland, love the characters, love the concept!!!! 5 stars!!!

0385341679|5.0|I was initially disappointed after speed-reading through this book.  Thankfully, a second, slower reading made me realize that my anticipation of an \\"ending\\" and the expectation of complete answers to the many questions about the characters was unrealistic.  KMM is a masterful storyteller who has left readers craving more with each book, and she did just that with Shadowfever.   I can appreciate that she did not give away all the secrets here because she plans to continue the story as New Dublin emerges amidst the continued conflict as well as to develop existing characters.     Of the revelations to be found here, I particularly liked how Mac's involvement with the Fae was conceived.  The unveiling of the Unseelie Prince came as a big surprise, but Mac's \\"hindsight\\" comment might mean that he isn't out of the picture completely.   We find out what's been making unearthly noises under the garage, and it's a little something that I didn't expect at all.  We know which side Rowena is on, finally, but we only get a taste of the real Barrons.  And I don't know what it says about me, but I really liked the Unseelie King!  I'm thinking he has gotten a bad rap from the Seelie.  For an ancient being who can create and destroy on a whim, he comes across as a father who occasionally sighs and shakes his head at the antics of his children but who allows them to make their own choices while watching over them and loving them unconditionally.  I loved his comment about \\"kids.\\"     On the other hand, Mac does have quite a few identity crises, and we were privy to many of her suppositions.  Dani seems more annoying, but I think she has potential.  Barrons somehow seems \\"less\\" here than in earlier books, though neither complacent nor compliant are quite the right words to describe him.  And I liked the relationship between Mac and Barrons more in the previous books  when they were constantly challenging one another.  There were a few times when the story seemed awkward, maybe a little bit contrived, but this is the first time that a KMM book has felt that way to me.   I'd say that that's a pretty good batting average.      Reading the previous books of this series would be a good idea before jumping into this one.  There is usually an explanation of prior events in Shadowfever, but the first four books are well worth reading anyway.  After all, those books are what made us anticipate this one so much.
B002J8LVO0|5.0|I liked the cd. I like U2. Their music is good and I like the message they deliver. Enjoyed the cd.

B002ZG99TA|2.0|I confess rarely like Denzel Washington movies, this one is no exception. The story is extremely contrived. Some idiot lets a train loose and of course, its full of toxic chemicals, that can destroy much of a city. Then we have an evil business owner more concerned with money than peoples' lives so making it worse, a manager who is a white and also more concerned with money than people who makes it worse, a black woman and she is both a manager and a good guy and Denzel Washington, who is both the victim of this cruel business and the hero. In the meantime, we get a few hair raising scenes, nothing that seemed believable.<br /><br />The acting was reasonable. Chris Pine's character development was I thought bad while Denzel Washington, who is a good actor played well.<br /><br />I do like a good action movie but I think the story just let it down.

B000L3CHC0|1.0|I absolutely love the look of the watch so I tried to purchase this watch from two Internet dealers, once from this Amazon merchant and once from Jomashop. And upon close inspection, both of them are the high-end AAA replicas made from China!!!    So I am going to vote this 1 star just remind everyone - please choose another model if you don't want to pay $300 for a fake made in China!    It's none of the faults of Tissot, or Amazon, or even the Internet dealers... it's just that Tissot is a very popular brand in China and PRC200 has been on the market for a very long time - giving plenty of time for the Chinese to perfect their replica.     It's staggering that I did a PRC200 search on the Chinese equivalent of eBay, there are thousands of fakes ranging from $60 USD to $150 USD. The ones I received are the AAA $150 one with the authentic Swiss quartz movement, but the build quality of the dials and bracelet is still a bit worse than the original Tissot.    It's shocking how the current market is flooded by replicas that I suspect the majority of the gray market PRC200 in US is fake. Because the movement is authentic, no Authorized Dealer will be willing to tell you that it's a fake, so we are completely at our digression here. I think even one of the images posted by Amazon customers on this page is fake, because you can see that the tachymeter is slightly out of position.    I ended up buying a Swiss Army watch... purely based on the conclusion that there are no high-end replicas for that model yet because it just came out last year.    Good luck everyone!
B00005JM02|4.0|Back in 2003, when Finding Nemo hit the big screen, Pixar had a track record of only four prior feature films! Having covered such topics as living toys, the day in the life of a bug, and blue-collar trials and tribulations of the average working monster, Finding Nemo represented a departure from land-based set computer wizardry to oceanic exploits of the grandest scale.<br /><br />Finding Nemo takes its viewers along on the offbeat voyage of an overprotective clownfish father, Marlin (Albert Brooks), as he attempts to locate his lost (abducted) son, Nemo (Alexander Gould). See it turns out that while defying his father, young Nemo wanders too close to a human scuba diving expedition and ends up becoming a salt-water aquarium specimen.<br /><br />In an instant, the once free clown fish finds himself captive (with several other inhabitants) in the waiting room of an Australian dentist's office.  The film basically divides its time flashing between the two environments: Marlin's trek across the ocean to reach Sidney Harbor (with the aid of a forgetful regal tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) and a hippie aquatic turtle named Crush (voiced by director Andrew Stanton)) & Nemo's time in captivity, planning a great escape.<br /><br />At a runtime of 100-minutes (1 hour, 40 minutes), Finding Nemo is one of the lengthier entries into the CG feature genera; a condition further exemplified by the plot pacing, which though certainly passable, seems to harken back to an era before the Pixar gang turned the craft into a well-oiled machine.<br /><br />On the surface the Finding Nemo formula is pretty simplistic, almost too linear for my own tastes but a little deeper examination reveals a pretty solid grasp of the complex relationship between a father and son; one in which all that remains of a once-thriving family (with 399 siblings) is one another.<br /><br />I have actually followed along on studies that set out to prove that in each other's absence, each of the title clown fish discover the missing element of their relationship: Marlin finds himself befriending a creature (Dory) who proves that survival is possible in the rough and tumble ocean without short term memory or even much common sense while the captive Nemo finds himself under the tutelage of a father figure (Gill) who finds no fault in continually putting Nemo in harm's way.  Without revealing too much of the film's conclusion, the arc of the story is in fact a lesson in perfecting the relationship between parent & child.<br /><br />The lighting effects and underwater setting of the film are still quite spectacular even to this day.  Scripting is, as is expected of the Disney/ Pixar machine, quite polished.  The humor is actually a little weak, especially when compared to the more risqu&eacute; overtones made famous by prime competition DreamWorks.  The Thomas Newman composition/ scoring is subliminally brilliant throughout.<br /><br />It should also be noted that the influence Finding Nemo has had on the collective industry in general is undeniable.  DreamWorks answered with their own underwater adventure a couple years later in Shark Tale, Weinstein Company's The Reef would follow suit two years after that and even 20th Century Fox wanted in on the action with 2010's The Dolphin: Story of a Dreamer.  Of course it could be argued that none were near as successful at delivering such a simple prose laced with such complex emotions.<br /><br />In all Finding Nemo has certainly earned its place in the hallowed halls of CG feature fame despite the fact that it's difficult for me to consider its delivery revolutionary.  It does nothing worthy of complaint, make no mistake, but in my opinion nor does it excel in the arena of humor, plotting or sheer Pixar-esque cleverness.<br /><br />By the way, the making-of featurette contains a segment that demonstrates Pixar's study of real aquatic environments as so thorough that early graphic tests were \\"too realistic\\". The appearance of theenvironments had to actually be cartooned for the actual production.  The comparison shots here are truly so amazing as to be worth the price of admission alone.  In all a very worthy addition to any collection.parison shots here are truly so amazing as to be worth the price of admission alone.  In all a very worthy addition to any collection.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Over all a good book, a bit disturbing at times but very interseting. I loved that the author used a five year olds perspective on our world.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|So i bought this watch back in december 2010 for around 80 bucks. It looks great and keeps great time for the price in pretty happy. I have been looking on the various seiko websites trying to find more info from seiko and havent really come up with much. Other sites say this watch is on the grey market, watches that are not sold in the u.s retail but are real. They have two languages on the day/date function. After a long search i found the seiko tokoyo website........[...] and a watch that looks very similar to the seiko 5 automatic military watch. It is Neo Sports SNZG09k1. It has a few more words on the dial and the number layout is different and the crown is in a different place. These two watches are very similar, making me think that the seiko 5 military may be a fake.    the  Real one?  [...]    The fake one?  [...]        If any one has any information about this please let me know, i really love this watch but want to know if its a fake or not
0525951652|5.0|After seeing the very divided opinions in the other reviews, I was a bit reluctant to read Ken Follett's newest novel, but then a copy arrived in my local library and I decided to give it a try. My expectations were not too high, but I soon found myself quite engrossed in the book and enjoyed it from beginning to end. The \\"Fall of Giants\\" is in my opinion not as good a novel as \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\", but this is probably due in great part to the difference in scope of the two novels, with the former looking at events all around the world while the latter focused primarily on a single town and the building of a cathedral. I agree with other reviewers' comments that some of the meetings of the characters in places like Russia or the trenches at Christmas 1914 are contrived and not too believable, but this is a novel whose main purpose - in my opinion - is to present the full scope of 20th century European (and to a lesser degree American) history, and to do so some artistic license is necessary in order to present key historical events. Even though I said that I did not like this novel as much as I did \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\", I still think this book deserves the 5 stars I have given it. First of all because, as I said, it is a good read. Second, it provides a much-needed lesson in the history of the early decades of 20th century Europe, and I suspect that most of the novel's readers will not have been aware of the complicated background to the outbreak of the First World War or to events like the anti-Bolshevik intervention of various Allied powers in Russia at the end of the war and for several years afterward. I am a professional historian, specializing in 19th and 20th century Europe, and I found no major errors in Follett's description of historical events. And I am greateful to anyone who helps increase the public's knowledge of history in an era where it is no longer given much emphasis in schools, particularly when it is simply submerged in the broad field of \\"Social Studies.\\"
B003JTHXOK|5.0|i have read all of his writtings and by far this is the best! much more grown up and he doesnt come across as prude while being descriptive in the passion of this book. definatley hits a soft spot if you can relate to this story! could not put it down! hopefully he keeps up wit this new style of writting. much more captivating! a little sleeping with the enemy but is able to add a nicholas sparks intensity! loved it!
0307266303|5.0|Great book, it's page turner... I read it quick!  Good mix of story-telling and insights about the human body.  Makes you appreciate God's marvelous creation even more!
B0011UBDTK|4.0|When I ordered this product I was so thrilled to see that I could find it at such an affordable price - HMV was asking for well over $100 for the exact same thing. The product arrived completely intact, none of the disks were scratched, and the plush cover felt soft and undamaged. My only qualm about it was how long it took to arrive, as it left me feeling a little nervous. However, I ordered my movies during the holidays, and there were several snow storms that hit right around that time, so I understand the delay in delivery. Overall, I had a wonderful experience with amazon, and will likely order something again in the future !
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Great product at a low low price.  1/2 the price as Best Buy.  Very please and will order from them again.
0385341679|5.0|I finished this story last night and I was completely blown away! I'm still trying to wrap my brain around some of it.I've followed the Fever series from the very beginning and while I took smug satisfaction in being right about some things,I was every bit as excited when I was wrong.    KMM shows bottomless creativity and unbelievable skill in giving us conclusion,while still leaving the door open to unexplored,unimagined possibilities.Mac's world isn't normal or capable of being wrapped up nice and neat,and frankly,I think it would be an insult to the readers,the author,and certainly the amazing characters themselves to even try.When I see people complaining or puzzling over the MacKeltars being present,I can only think that they must not have read any of KMM's Highlander novels.Shadowfever is what we've been destined for ever since KMM first mentioned the Fae in those books,whether she planned it that way or not.Everyone is there for a purpose,and their assistance in containing the Dark Book only enhances those stories and this one as well.    Shadowfever will challenge the way you think,what you know,how you know it,just as surely as it challenges Mac.I have been there right beside her on this journey,sometimes afraid,sometimes angry,happy,and everything else you can think of.I have never felt more afraid for her or more anxious and impatient than in this book,where I felt the closest to her.Even Barrons,who has gotten on my nerves in the past for all his secrets and his cold attitude,failed to irritate me in this book.I feel like I understand him more,and I have both respect and compassion for him now,where before there was only impatience,teeth-gritting in spades,grudging appreciation of his humor,and a certain unwilling fascination.Mac and Barrons have both changed for me,and what they've become resists all attempts at tidy containment in an ending.Their world,and the others in it,are the same way.Things will go on,because we have a master storyteller with the ability to do so.    For me,this is just the beginning.
B003ODHOA4|1.0|I opted for the kindle editon for all the usual reasons: search functions that actually work, font resize functions, etc. Big mistake. The search function does not work on the kindle (it does work however if I read the book on my Mac.)  The worst is the font size. None of the Chinese characters used throughout the book can be enlarged for easier or more comfortable reading, and some of the English text happens to be embedded with the hanzi, so you cannot enlarge it either.  I would certainly have abstained from buying it or would have gone for the paperback edition instead. This should be clearly stated on the product description, since a kindle edition of a book with Chinese script clearly does not fulfill the expectations of a normal kindle/e-book edition. I feel taken for a ride.
B0037AGASG|5.0|I purchased this cd for my 12 year old daughter.  she loves this young man.  While she's listening to him I found myself humming some tunes also.
0312370849|1.0|Yes there is a fascinating catalyst for this work of historical fiction.   It's a shame that it wasn't written by an author with sufficient talent and imagination to write a good book about it.   On the merits I would have given the book 2 stars but I am downgrading to 1 star because it is so over-rated by others.
0930289234|5.0|In many of my reviews, I state I cannot imagine a graphic novel ever getting 5 stars as that would put it on the level of Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, etc.  I was wrong.  This book ranks right up there with the best literature in history.  The complexity of the characters and this storyline is amazing.<br /><br />The story may lose something to younger readers as it may be hard to put the events and the \\"alternate\\" reality, into context as they never lived through any part of the Cold War.  Even for those that did, it may be hard to place yourself back 25 years ago when this was being written and Vietnam and the Kennedy Assassination were not so far in the past.<br /><br />I cannot imagine how anyone cannot consider this the greatest graphic novel of all time.  I think it ranks up there as one of the best English-language novels of all time.<br /><br />I warn potential buyers that this is full of content.  You will have to read this book 4-5 times before you can truly get everything out of it.  It is by no means a quick read either.  You need full attention to detail when reading.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Rod's new version of these old songs make them much better sounding than the old ones which i never liked anyway. Now i like his versions and will listen to them all the time.  Whoever thinks the old sappy ones are better needs to have their ears checked because Rod and his wonderful sounding band makes these easy to listen to now and much more enjoyable than ever before. I will buy all of his Cd's and be very happy listening to them. I know good music when i hear it and Rod does a wonderful job singing them.  Hope he makes many many more volumes. He can sing anything well.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|MacKayla is a flawed, young adult character but I like her even more for being flawed.  She's stumbling around trying to find her way as best she can, like most young people.  She doesn't have all the answers and everything doesn't perfectly fall into place for her.  Some new characters are introduced that are key players.  Dani does something shocking, as does V'Lane.      I found the ending to be satisfying and I believe the door has been left open for additional stories in this series and I'm looking forward to reading them.  The ending was very satisfying for me even though there are still quite a few questions needing to be answered. I'm hoping that the series will continue with some of the other characters like Dani and Ryodan. I'd like for them to have their own book, or perhaps one of the other of Barron's nine.
0143116738|3.0|Sir Ken Robinson provides many examples of people who have found their Element, and he convinced me that it was important for people to do so, but I wanted some concrete suggestions I could use to find my Element. They may be in there, but all I found were generalizations. And he goes off on his real passion, which is how the educational system does an injustice to a lot of kids by not helping them find their Element. I don't disagree with him, on that point, but it's not what I was expecting from the title.
B00466HM28|4.0|This product is very compact and extremely affordable.  It has all the features you may want out a controller (except the mod and pitch bend wheels; but you can assign those functions to knobs).  Speaking of knobs, for some reason the default program setting for the controller is set to have no control change (CC#) value for any of the knobs, this makes it seem to a first time MIDI user such as myself that the unit's knobs are non-responsive.  Customer service is very busy/poor at AKAI/ALESIS's 800 telephone number and e-mail support seems very slow as well.  All you have to do is change the program to the 2nd default setting and the knobs have values assigned, you don't need to return the controller or have it repaired.M
0385732554|4.0|This is the second book I have read by Lois Lowry, the first being \\"Number the Stars\\". I loved that book and decided to give this one a try, especially given the overwhelming positive reviews. I am glad I did. In a nut shell \\"The Giver\\" is about a boy who turns 12 and is selected as the next Receiver of Memory for his community. As he goes through his training (Receiving memories from the previous Receiver of Memory) his eyes are open and he begins to learn many things about his society that trouble him. Some of the issues he faces are that he truly learns what it means to be \\"released\\" from the society, the truth about the outside world called, \\"Elsewhere\\", and love. This is just a small sampling of the issues he tackles. I found the book to be very thought provoking when compared to our current society. One of the issues other than the ones mentioned above is the idea of not having birth parents but rather choosing a child to raise, with two being the maximum. The family seems to be close knit, but is lacking love. If you look at our society, it seems that work and all other sorts of issues are put ahead of the family and there is a lack of love and unity. This, in my opinion is part of the reason why our society has degraded so much. Overall, I thought the book was good and I am glad I read it.
0385341679|5.0|I was very happy to realize that I was late in this game. I started to read this series about 4 days ago and when I wondered when the next book came out I know my copy from amazon wouldn't come fast enough I had to go to a local bookstore and buy one.          I devoured this series. This last book was How would Mac put it \\"Epic\\". I love how everything in this series flowed well to the end when you found out everything. All the secrets and doubts that Mac had were put to rest. There is love, loss, heartache, shock, action. I could not put this series down and of course this was the best of the series. Karen did not disappoint in this book. I still want to go back and read it again, that's when you know you have a very good book are your hands. I don't think I could read this book enough times to keep my mind at ease. This book is EPIC. This book is on my top 10 list of fav's and gotta have.     Highly Recommend this book to everyone. You have to read.
0385341679|5.0|I never wanted to put it down! I'm sad that the series is over but Karen did a wonderful job of ending it. Of course there are still some unanswered questions but I love when books allow you to draw your own conclusions.

B000ZECQ08|4.0|SPOILERS BELOW    All right, so I've come to the conclusion that Half Blood Prince is my least favorite of the Harry Potter movies. It's not because of all the stuff that is cut from the book, but simply because it just doesn't \\"draw me in\\" like the other ones do. I know the first two films aren't perfect, but they both make me so happy whenever I watch them (probably because of the nostalgia). My favorites in the series are Deathly Hallows Part I, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Order of the Phoenix.    That being said, I do like Half Blood Prince. I thought Michael Gambon gave his best Dumbledore performance here, all the young actors were good, Jim Broadbent was good (really, the acting was perfectly fine). The Cave scene is hands down the best scene in the film in my opinion. Overall, though, Half Blood Prince focused too much on the comedy/romantic aspects. I was perfectly fine with the fact that Hogwarts was more \\"sexified\\", but it felt as though the Tom Riddle (and the Half Blood Prince story) took a back seat to it. But still, this movie has other things to offer, and it has gorgeous cinematography.    The DVD itself is really good. None of the DVDs so far have topped the Goblet of Fire DVD, which is completely stocked with great Bonus features. This DVD has some good ones, and the best one has to be the J.K. Rowling documentary. It really gives fans a deeper insight into how J.K.'s life influenced the books.    Overall, I'd say this is worth the purchase if you're a Harry Potter fan and you want some neat bonus features on your DVD. I bought it primarily to add to my collection of all the other films.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I could make a better home movie than that!  It's just a home movie!    Long and boring and cheap.  A fake reality fake home movie.
B001993Y3G|1.0|I just love this movie but this version of the Blu-ray is just junk.  - Slim box whit poor quality.  - Bad restauration of me movie, I already see very older movies whit better visual treatment, this is just like a VHS.  - Very limited extras, no \\"title menus\\", just a \\"pause ecreen\\" whit de options plus extras.  I´m very fan os this movie, probably i'll resell this bad taste product and search (or whait) a new version.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|be sure to read the other books first or you shall be totally lost. this was such a great book. take your time with it and don't rush becaue there is ALOT of stuff to soak in. this series will definitley be on my &#34;favorites&#34; shelf. ~spoiler ahead~ so glad Mac got her HEA!
0307594009|4.0|This book was so refreshing in the way it was told. Told from the perspective of your ordinary teenage girl,what makes it so extraordinary is that her world is surrounded by hatred, hunger, panic, and survival. But when you read Anne's words, you forget that reality, like she would sometimes, and you begin to see her world through her eyes. What a remarkable young lady.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|I like many of the other reviewers found the book to be very well researched. However, many of my concerns stem from the feasibility of the author's suggestions. As an avid runner & fitness buff for most of my life, I fear that these suggestions are nothing more than a quick & temporary solution to an ever increasing problem of epidemic proportions. I simply don't believe that this book offers many viable solutions to the obesity problem in any realistic or sustainable way. You would be better served having worked out in the time you would be spending in the daily reading of this book.
068484267X|4.0|This read was incredibly well written and awfully descriptive of the degenerative life this little boy experienced. His account of his childhood was raw. Sometimes an author can write in such a way to make us all blush of how the human condition can become.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|It could be better in some areas, but it really is a steal for the price. Pros with expensive glass may want to spend more on one with more padding and stiffer outer shell.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|This Blu-ray release is the best middle ground between the  Cundey version and the Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition. John Carpenter always in his movies tries to convey some type rudimentary philosophic incite and occasionally reveals much illumination of guarded esoteric issues. Halloween presents us with the archetype of fear and the consequences of human nature when faced with that fright (the shape). Fear is a powerful weapon for the skilled and detriment to those who react inappropriately, thus is fears nature it is \\"the mind killer\\".
0525423273|5.0|MY THOUGHTS  Anna and the French Kiss is one of those rare stories where we find ourselves instantly enamored, so swept up in the emotional conflict our facial muscles become sore from the constant oscillation between the dopey grin we are helpless to stifle during moments of innocent flirting, and the furrowed brow and drawn mouth that result when events don't go the way we hoped. It's a sweet, honest, and endearing tale illustrating how often we get in our own way in relationships, our ability to communicate utterly foiled by overthinking and overanalyzing every minute detail, thereby keeping us from the very thing we crave most and might actually acquire if we could overcome our paralyzing fear of rejection and find our voice. We clutch the pages with palms gone sweaty from the prevalent romantic tension, leaving behind a physical imprint on the book in reciprocation for the intangible but powerful impression it leaves on our hearts.    Anna is adorable and lovable, full of anxiety and insecurity over attending an international boarding school, but she impresses us by putting on a brave face most of the time, making friends of both the other students and us as readers very easily. Her inner monologues and quips are a constant source of humor, and we seamlessly slip into her mind and vicariously live out her story as though it were our own, sharing with her the dreamy stares in St. Clair's direction and the constant longing to be viewed as someone other than the best friend. Though Anna has intense feelings for St. Clair, she doesn't mope, pine, or lose herself completely in her infatuation, instead building a camaraderie and a touching friendship that simmers with a nail-biting amorous suspense, and overflows with a potential we want to see fulfilled with every fiber of our being.    St. Clair is undeniably worthy of Anna's attention, exuding blissfully believable levels of charm and wit, and leaving the overconfident bravado and pretty-boy swagger to less worthyand less interesting fictional leading men. He's physically attractive enough to warrant the ample amount of female attention he receives, but he's not so inhumanly beautiful that we can't conceive of his interest in Anna, and while he possesses an impressive number of positive attributes, he also makes several infuriating and hurtful decisions that bring him down off an unreachable pedestal and make him both more accessible and more intriguing for his flaws. Their courtship is almost painfully slow, but it's the type of pain that tingles with sensual restraint, and we find ourselves positively vibrating with tension as we not so patiently wait for the moment when passion will overtake propriety, and romantic satisfaction will finally replace the anticipation and anxiety coursing through our veins.    Anna and the French Kiss is a story that makes us smile and laugh, but also one that keeps our insides in knots as we walk the sometimes painful and uncomfortable path toward love. Anna welcomes us into her life with open arms, holding nothing back and allowing us to see all of her insecurities coupled with her extraordinary strengths, and we can't help but adore her for the joy she brings us as we fumble our way through the City of Light together. A heartwarming tale at it's finest, this book is one that can be read again and again as we never tire of the butterflies in our stomachs, the flush to our skin, and the catch in our breathing as we experience first love and all it entails.    Rating: 5/5
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I'm so sorry I wasted two hours on this movie.  It was slow, boring and without plot.  Holy cow.  I went downstairs to switch some laundry around and told my husband to not worry about pausing it.  Came back and, guess what?  I didn't miss a thing.  Clooney probably had 8 lines in the whole movie.  He stares.  He drives.  He makes guns.  He shoots people.  He stares some more.  What on earth was he thinking?  SKIP THIS!
031603438X|3.0|I'm not the first reviewer to say any of this, but here goes.    Keith Richards gives a lucid and readable history of his life here.  His turns of phrase are excellent, and the stories generally interesting and often laugh-out-loud funny.    But, cut by 40%, it would have been a better book.  Throwing all the stuff emphasizing music into one chapter, and all the stuff emphasizing drugs and debauchery into one chapter, would have spared the reader from having these topics intrude again and again and again.  Hearing how he and Bobby Keys or Graham Parsons or someone else got wasted is funny/amusing once, then less and less so with each new tale of a different bender in a different country in a different decade.  The musically-inclined reader will eat up the stuff about tunings and keys and licks, but someone who just wants to enjoy the music itself probably won't follow it.    This is Keith's own story so he can say what he wants, but I wanted to hear more about Altamont, or the 1972 tour, or Toronto, and less about things like how to make bangers and mash, or technique in a knife fight.  The editor had a good ear for Keith, but a bad ear for what a lot of readers (me at least) would have liked to have seen.    Richards has had an interesting life, is a great musician, and a devoted father and husband and son.  His story just deserves a better-edited telling than it's given here.
B00000DHRX|5.0|Years ago, i was given this album from my sister who was giving away cd's. This is by far his best, even though it's greatest hits, and not an actual album. The first disc is my favorite, the only thing it's missing are his Wham hits, besides that, i love the first disc, it's great.
B0043X7WLA|4.0|As a long time fan of Sufjan Stevens, I wrinkled my nose when I first popped in this CD. This album deviates a bit from his earlier works, in that it is heavy on the electronica. But after a couple of times listening to it, the songs got stuck in my head. Pretty good album. It grows on you.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie is hilarious! My fiance and I watch it over and over. It would be great for kids and/or adults to watch! Cute story line too. Grumbly villain softens up to be sweet in his own way!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|As a former world history teacher, I found The Tudors to be one of the most outstanding works on Tudor England that I have ever seen.  There appears to be no detail left unattended. The series displays the power struggles of the Crown and the Church and among the diplomats from the powerful countries of Europe. It accurately shows the people of the time; their devotion to the King and their ever changing attitudes to his queens. The acting is outstanding by all.  This series is a beautiful, powerful, sweeping history of many people who changed the world.
B003VANOFY|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3MVCBK84TWVZI]]The g930 is actually an awesome headset. The design is great, listening to music is crisp & clear, wireless is now a luxury I won't be able to live without, and these could very well be the best headphones I've ever had.    However, there is a major problem plaguing this headset, and while it could most likely be fixed with a simple driver update, sadly logitech just doesn't seem to care...    The deal breaker occurs when using the mic, there is a constant buzzing/interference sound.  It doesn't matter if it is completely silent when I'm recording, the sound won't go away!  Doesn't matter if I'm using the logitech drivers, or windows default drivers, laptop or desktop, doesn't matter if I'm on Win XP machine, or Vista...    If you browse their support forums you will this is a rampant problem with everyone who owns the g930.  And you'll also see that support is pretty much non-existent too.  Such a shame, I would love them except for this one issue, and these headphones are now going back...
B001H9MYPW|5.0|EXCELLENT!!  Can't wait for Season Three. . . I keep looking for it, but it's not for sale yet.  Stop teasing us and release In Treatment, Season Three.    What a clever idea the British had and now it's in America.  And, of course, I love the cast and Gabriel Byrne. . .Woof, Woof, what a cutie pie.    When you take so long in releasing (I'm 65 years old), I get caught up in other series and never go back.  For instance, Damages, loved it at first, then couldn't find when it was starting up again for the second season, so I abandoned it.  Sorry, Glenn Close. . .you're still one of the best, if not THE best, actress today.    For goodness sake, get a move on, I'd like to see In Treatment, Season Three before I die.    Rita
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I've been on Facebook for 6 years, felt like I was one of the first to join about a year after the launch, back when you had to have a college email address to join. I had to watch the movie to learn the history behind the social phenomenon that has taken up a lot of my time lol. The movie is interesting, funny, & they couldn't have picked better actors. I honestly don't know how much of it is true & how much is purely for entertainment, but either way, it's a great film everyone should watch. Amazing what this one brilliant college kid did for people all over the world. Through Facebook, I have found family members I had never met & have actually become good friends w/ a 3rd cousin I wouldn't have even known about. Whatever your view of Mark Zuckerberg, you'll watch this & realize he's a genius!
B003L20IFQ|5.0|Ryan Reynolds in a box for an hour and a half. That's how it was sold, that's what I was expecting, but that's not what I got. Ryan Reynolds could have been in a box anywhere else in the world, and the director still probably would have churned out an effective thriller. But I get the feeling that this was not a thriller by design. Ryan Reynolds is in a box, buried somewhere in the Iraqi desert, and help seems sooner to come from the people who put him there than the country that employed him. Why is that?<br /><br />As is, this is an effective thriller. Don't expect to be frightened; expect tension, a touch of claustrophobia, and those uncomfortable moments when you find yourself trying to decide what YOU would do if you ever found yourself in the same predicament. You have a phone, a Zippo lighter, and a collection of pencils. Who do you call? Just how patient could you remain in a coffin, buried somewhere, at some depth, knowing your oxygen was slowly dwindling down to nothing?<br /><br />Visualizing the method for filming BURIED, I can tell production probably involved  not much more than Ryan Reynolds in a cheap coffin, in a dark area, for long stretches of time in some film studio somewhere. But Ryan Reynolds made me believe that he was a truck driver for a contractor company who suddenly found himself buried alive. His acting here is amazingly involving. He asked all the questions I would have asked, with just the right amount of intensity, and lost his cool at all the right cues. Again, Ryan Reynolds in a box for an hour and a half, but I believed every second of it.<br /><br />But what I loved the most about this film was that it really aspired to be more than just a thriller. If help for Reynolds's character came immediately, it would be a really short movie. Most of his tribulations in that coffin stem from the inability and, in some cases, complete unwillingness of his contacts to rescue him. His capture becomes something less than a simple \\"search and rescue\\" in the eyes of the military and his employers, and becomes something a little more political. At some point, you have to stop and wonder if something like this would actually happen. Maybe, maybe not, but what's the life of one truck driver worth to a company that could stand to lose millions? Or to a branch of the military that might be publicly embarrassed by the incident?<br /><br />Good question! That's all I can say. This was a great movie that, to me, worked on several different levels, played at various moral dilemmas, and showed that Ryan Reynolds definitely has the talent worthy of something more than the odd comedy. If he doesn't get a nomination, I'd be surprised.e military and his employers, and becomes something a little more political.

B0045I3EJC|5.0|...and I don't understand why. This film is gorgeously made, edited, thought out, the acting is solid, the meaning one's own... I don't know why it hasn't been shown in more countries? It will either become a cult classic or so many people will begin to talk about it that it will be shown in film history classes the world over and then it will receive the merit that it deserves. Seriously, if you want almost two-hours of the most imaginative, seamlessly interwoven, surreal narrative, this is the film to see. It's magical realism meets science fiction meets love story meets Maya Deren. Rent it, it will be worth your view.    And please, spread the word. This a gift too precious to be so unknown.
0061715050|4.0|This was one of the first in a myriad of novels that I first explored in the infancy of my interests in literature.  I enjoyed reading this book at the prepubescent stage of my life because the children in the book were reminiscent of contemporary children but they exhibited aspects of children coping with a terrible situation, such as war and they sough escape through the wardrobe.  The novel began in war-torn times and created a wonderful dream world to alleviate the pain of reality.<br /><br />The fascinating part of the novel that takes you away from the terrible reality is that the animals in the book talk and are presented with real human emotions.  Somehow animals explain emotion turmoil and loss in life when the people characters were lackluster and stoic.  Soon the children gradually grow up through their contact with animals in the dreamscape of their imagination.  Narnia is a place where issues that are difficult to grapple with in reality are skillfully explained and dealt with in the imaginative and creative world of a child's mind.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|This is unreal. George Lucas' refusal to remaster THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASES -- aka the very films that made him untold amounts of money, brought him international renown, and enabled him to do pretty much whatever the hell he wanted to in Hollywood after their success -- is sickening. Watching the \\"Special Editions\\" and seeing the dim-witted CGI additions that I would swear my 4-year-old niece had done herself is painful at best.     I really don't get it, because if I were in George's position it would be the original fans that made the movies a success who I'd be working the hardest to please. And it doesn't take much research to realize that THEY ALL WANT THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASES ON BLURAY. Is that honestly asking too much of a man with essentially every film-related piece of technology at his fingertips?     I could go on and on even more about how mind-boggling it is that all of Star Wars' biggest fans could ever be treated so poorly, but I'll stop here. As someone who grew up in the '90s watching my Mom's VHS Star Wars tapes, and then eventually getting the VHS box-set \\"digitally-remastered in THX\\" version, it's literally unbelievable to me that I can't get a copy of each of the original three movies in the latest and best digital video format.     Give us the original theatrical releases, completely remastered to the highest possible audio and video quality, or don't waste your time on the original trilogy at all; Because THIS ISN'T THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY. This is not what tens of millions of people grew up with and still consider to be one of the most breathtaking cinematic experiences ever. This is not what people get foggy-eyed over as they recollect in full detail the day that they waited in massive lines to see Star Wars at the theater for the first time.     This pathetic release is nothing more than another disgraceful money-grab by George Lucas and co. Boycott.
0439023513|2.0|Search the word \\"DISAPPOINTED\\" through all the reviews.  Even a lot of positive reviews start out with, \\"I was dissatisfied with the ending at first but, later I decided I was wrong...\\"  I'm sorry, but in this case, if it feels like the ending sucks, it sucks.<br /><br />But the first two books were good right?  YES.  So, from there you're probably left thinking, \\"Now we have a team of the most proven, charismatic, skilled assassins escape, join a rebellion, and get ready to use their leadership and warfare skills to bring an end to hundreds of years of horrible oppression!  Within that is a tense love triangle and characters evolving in important ways.  Just imagine how great this could have been!  How could you go wrong with such a promising premise?!  But it does go wrong.  If you liked the first books, this probably *isn't the ending you're searching for*.  It shows Collins is skilled when dealing with a smaller story with a more focussed group of characters, but something as large in scope as a whole WAR is outside her comfort zone.<br /><br />In the end, the story arc of Katnis Everdeen is not satisfying.  Mockingjay spends time in the wrong places, has characters' story arcs end abruptly without payoff or meaning, and it is even logically flawed.  Even when trying to make an anti-war point, it trips over its own feet.  Instead it just paints a picture of a situation where war is necessary to bring peace, and rather than admit that fact, it tries to rearrange the events of the ending to show \\"See, both sides shouldn't be fighting!\\"  What?  I wish this book could get an \\"undo\\", and we could get a do-over.<br /><br />Is this book Real or not Real?  I wish, not real.  Sad.  Hopefully whoever makes the Mockingjay MOVIE will say, \\"Thanks for the first two books, we'll take it from here.\\"

B003UBTX7C|5.0|First, the current price of this ebook is half what you would pay for the hard bound version. If you don't like the price, wait until the price drops when the paperback comes out. Some of us are happy to pay a few bucks more to read our favorite authors when the book first comes out. Do you complain that non-electronic hardcover books cost more than paperbacks? Secodly, Amazon doesn't read your reviews and, if they did, they wouldn't care because it doesn't affect their profits.  By using this forum to express you misguided outrage you hurt other readers who are expecting you the give them a fair review of the book, and possibly the author who does not set Amazon's prices. Thirdly, Amazon is a business, not a democracy. You don't have a right to cheap books! If you don't like their prices, then you should go to a library, or buy an iPad and see if Apple's prices are better (good luck with that!). So all you people who want to use this forum to make a political statement, PLEASE JUST SHUT UP!
B00479SVBU|5.0|This mp3 car adapter works exactly as described.  It is fairly easy to navigate and allows you to read the title/artist on each track. So far we've not had any trouble with finding a frequency that plays perfectly with no static/etc.  The SD card option is nice, but the sound quality is somewhat compromised over the mp3 player connection. As other reviewers stated, there is a buzzing/hum that is audible at louder levels when you use the SD card, but not with the player connection.  I especially like the 'neatness' of the unit, as there are no cords or cassette tape parts to have to connect.  Shipping was super speedy, I'm very happy with this purchase. :)

I must say, that if you liked the movie, well, just read the book. It is hard sci-fi at its best. It fills in all the question s you might have from the movie.  His imagery is so enigmatic and beautiful. The things he describes on \\"the other side\\" are nothing but a superior imagination. 10 out of 10!

184744346X|1.0|As a Sabbath fan, I was very interested in reading this book, but frankly there is nothing in it worthy of reading. With this in mind, I persisted through it long enough to read almost halfway before I finally got sick of reading about one drug-addled totally clueless person's antics whose main contribution seems to have been being clueless, drunk, high or stoned throughout the entire time a great band was being formed. Geezer wrote the lyrics, Tony Iommi wrote the music, but Ozzy apparently stumbled through it like Charlie Chaplin, clueless but somehow coming out on top, narrowly avoiding death on a daily basis while other people did everything else.<br /><br />To think I used to kind of think he had a legacy and some musical talent from so many years in the business. I grew up sort of idolizing Randy Rhoades and the whole culture and musical DNA that Black Sabbath (and Ozzy) churned out into the collective consciousness. This book cured me of that illusion, showing that it was all completely in the hands of other people to effect an outcome, not in Ozzy's. Not so much a frontman as a total sideshow joke among some seriously talented people. Like an old senile man who has a knack for surrounding himself with billionaires who kinda put up with him, Forrest Gumping his way through life but on drugs and drunk.<br /><br />It's like reading the tale of an enormous Rube Goldberg rock and roll machine where everything looked like it would fail and fall down at any second but somehow managed to hit the next target through some amazing accident of karma or fate or whatever. He somehow hires Randy Rhoades after hearing him warming up for his audition, and to hear Zakk Wylde tell it, he got the job randomly by being Ozzy's drug dealer who finally got his music heard one day while Ozzy was picking up drugs.<br /><br />Talk about getting lucky! There are people with luck in this world and Ozzy Osbourne is clearly one of them. Maybe the guy's got a good heart, etc. but he's essentially a total waste of a person wrapped up with some randomly expressed and purely accidental musical talent, nursed along by legions of helpers and assistants (who he'd likely then abuse, shoot, poison, drug, run over or otherwise demolish randomly through no conscious will of his own) throughout his life. The guy should be clearly dead a thousand times over, from what you can tell from the stories in the book, he likely should have been dead somehow nearly every day of his entirely drug-fueled life. He was even stoned during the entire shooting of the TV series, but that's obvious from watching even one episode.<br /><br />Insert any random story here, add drugs and you could have written this book. Here is the entire book: Crappy upbringing in gray town. Slaughterhouse, random story, drinking, drugs &lt;random story> drugs drugs. This ENTIRE book is about doing drugs, almost killed myself or someone else there-oops!, finding drugs, having sex randomly, oh and we REALLY make a nice record, loved that- drugs, down the pub, drinking, cocaine, had some regrets (ya think!), drugs, booze, records, etc.<br /><br />Then I read in this comments section that one guy got this for his kid (HIS KID!). Of course, my writing this will make everyone want to read it, but honestly, there isn't anything more to know here than Ozzy is the luckiest man in history.a person wrapped up with some randomly expressed and purely accidental musical talent, nursed along by legions of helpers and assistants (who he'd likely then abuse, shoot, poison, drug, run over or otherwise demolish randomly through no conscious will of his own) throughout his life.

He was even stoned during the entire shooting of the TV series, but that's obvious from watching even one episode.    Insert any random story here, add drugs and you could have written this book. Here is the entire book: Crappy upbringing in gray town. Slaughterhouse, random story, drinking, drugs <random story> drugs drugs. This ENTIRE book is about doing drugs, almost killed myself or someone else there-oops!, finding drugs, having sex randomly, oh and we REALLY make a nice record, loved that- drugs, down the pub, drinking, cocaine, had some regrets (ya think!), drugs, booze, records, etc.     Then I read in this comments section that one guy got this for his kid (HIS KID!). Of course, my writing this will make everyone want to read it, but honestly, there isn't anything more to know here than Ozzy is the luckiest man in history.
B003VQM2ME|5.0|Both this and the first Grinderman album are true gems, completely deserving of the praise that has been thus far heaped upon them.  Those who are already familiar with the work of Nick Cave have only a mild indication of where this work can take the listener - nothing else in his back-catalog sounds quite like this, blending garage jam sessions with backwoods swamp boogie and a raw blues power.  The fact that such a seasoned veteran of the music world had a hand in the creation of this beast should make no difference; this album is incredibly strong, never losing its sense of direction or, even more importantly, never losing its sense of fun.  Any listeners coming to this album having no previous experience of Cave's world of Biblical torment, sexual depravity and witty lyricism be warned: this voodoo brew is addicting.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|Esse disco é um clássico moderno, creio que daqui a 10 anos será avaliado como um dos discos fundamentais do século XXI.  Trata-se de um álbum de extrema melancolia e delicadeza, ao mesmo tempo explorando timbres diferenciados.
B0008ENHUI|4.0|This is one of those classiv movies that you can't just forget as it happened to me. I have always wanted to keep this movie following my watching it three times in a row at sone stage back then.  The movie also me me to become a fan of Dustin Hoffman who co-stars with the equally talented and popular Steve McQueen.  Papillon is a story of perseverance,determination, pain,guts and glory.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Who can't forget Secretariat? The truth is, all of us who happened to be alive on this planet when this famous horse made history in 1973, can still remember those days, even if some of us didn't have any interest whatsoever in horse racing. But, still, we cheered for him, and he was really a world-wide phenomenon, a legend in his own time. The splendid and captivating \\"Secretariat\\" captures this horse's magnificent achievement in glorious detail.    The film's narrative is straightforward, and it begins in Denver, in 1969, in the home of Penny Chenery (Diane Lane), Jack Tweedy (Dylan Walsh), and their children. This particular day, Penny receives a phone call, informing her about her mother's sudden death in Virginia. She immediately departs to her parent's ranch, in order that she can be with them, especially her father Chris (Scott Glenn), who is old and in bad health. He used to raise racing horses and Penny inherited his passion. Against her brother's and husband's will, who warned her that the family finances were in bad shape, she decides to keep the family business, and hires Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) to train the horses. About this time, too, Secretariat is born and shows promise for racing. Against all odds, and with her financial future at risk, Penny decides to take a chance with Secretariat (a.k.a. Big Red). The risk pays off, and Secretariat easily wins almost every race in the circuit, and gets the opportunity to compete for the prestigious Triple Crown.     Although Secretariat's history in the Triple Crown is well-known, director Randall Wallace does a great job in keeping the suspense going at all times. In addition, he also triumphs in portraying and comparing Penny Chenery's tenacity and attitude with that of Secretariat's. This is a story of will and character in the worst of times. The fascinating Blue-ray combo pack is loaded with extras, including how the races were choreographed, conversations with the real Penny Chenery, audio commentary by the director, deleted scenes, multi-angle simulations, and much more. Released January 25, 2011. (USA, 2010, color, 123 min plus additional materials).    Reviewed exclusively by Eric Gonzalez on January 23, 2011.
1594202842|4.0|Full disclosure: I am second generation South Asian, and I and my two siblings were raised without playdates or sleepovers, were expected to devote most of our time to our education, spent summers taking accelerated courses, and were given expensive tuition, Ivy league colleges and medical schools.  (Yes, we are all physicians.)  Summers were dedicated to study. My mother - a concert pianist - did start us all on the piano, but she accepted my refusal to play and allowed me to quit at age 6.  My sister, who is tone deaf but who cared a lot more about our mother's approval,  eventually became an adequate but not great violinist based entirely on the position of her fingers on the struts, since she couldn't distinguish the notes. My mother never figured it out, but my sister had to quit the orchestra when our brother graduated from HS because she couldn't tune her violin.  This system of parenting does achieve its goals.     On the other hand, there are downsides to the Asian method. It is really really hard for us to make friends, negotiate with bosses or spouses, or to defend against politicking by colleagues.  We do tend to see things as all or nothing.  People think of us as arrogant and aloof, but really, we are shy and used to rejection, and eventually one stops trying.  The Asian method got us through medical school, but I think we would all have done better if we had spent less time studying and more time learning how to make friends, negotiate, and in general develop social skills.  (The Asian method may well be why we Asians are discriminated against in university admissions, whereas Jewish people who have much the same culture but who are carefully trained in social skills are not.  Harvard has quotas for Asians but not for Jews, and Harvard would be 80 percent Asian if it weren't for those quotas.)  I think summer jobs would have been more useful than summer school, and frankly, the long tradition of kids working in this country is why the United States does so well despite its crummy education system.       Then again, my eldest, adopted out of Guatemala at age almost three, with frank protein-deficiency malnutrition and with severe learning disabilities would now be mentally retarded if I had followed the American model.  One thing that we Asians do know is that thoughtful practice improves most things. Japanese students with learning disabilities perform at the level of our average students; Japanese normal Japanese kids perform at the level of our gifted students, and their gifted students blow our gifted kids out of the water.  So, instead of accepting matters, as we were urged by the experts to do, we put in that 5 or hours a day on top of the school/homework load on the nuts and bolts of reading and math. Language therapy, visual exercises, gross motor coordination, fine motor coordination, phonemic awareness, phonics, spelling, grammar instruction, fluency drills, comprehension drills, math drills, word problems.  The list goes on and on.  But since IQ is modifiable, it meant she went from an IQ of around 70 to an IQ of around 100. She is currently 20, a junior in a level 3 state college, holding a part time job, maintaining an extensive network of friends, fluent in Spanish and English.  She is still a weak student, and comes down every week to study with us, and I still go over her first drafts of all of her papers, but she looks good to graduate in four years. Being mentally retarded would not have improved her life.  But yeah, I allowed sleep overs, playdates, and we didn't study on birthdays, holidays or when we were on our yearly vacation, although I did arrange edutainment on vacations, e.g. visits to museums etc.  My second kid, age 13 is having a very good time, does well academically - I do accept Bs - and is in Prealgebra in 7th grade. However, I'm sending her to get her Algebra credit this summer, as it is time to start pushing the envelope.  Still, Chua is a bit over the top.
0061998494|4.0|I've always enjoyed Ferguson's show when he started Late Night.  I find his droll wit very engaging, and it plays over well with his guests, too.  I was truly impressed with how he detailed the low parts of his life while accentuating the good as well.  It was refreshing to read a truthful autobiography, and found it quite entertaining and a fast read as well.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This review is written over a year after purchasing and adhering to this dvd workout.  I have lost over 20 pounds by starting at 143lbs. and am now maintaining 123 lbs.  Honestly, I actually lost a majority of it in the first month of using this workout everyday, for a month.  I started watching what I ate, not stuffing myself at every meal, and exercising regularly.  For only having to work out 30 min. a day, it's pretty awesome to see such great results so quickly.  In the first month, I lost 6lbs with daily workouts.  In the past, I've tried running on treadmills at the gym, doing pilates at home, but never realizing that I need to do both in combination in order to see results.  When I say I've tried other things, I mean, I've devoted several months to them, and saw no results.  Jillian's intense strength, cardio, and abs workout is exactly what my body needed to start finally dropping that weight.  Even after a year, the workouts are still challenging, although I only work out once to three times a week now.  I had also bought her trouble zones dvd, but found I preferred this dvd better because it's so easily layed out for you already.  All I have to do is hit play, and I can trust that I'll start working towards a healthier lifestyle.
B003UBTX72|5.0|After hearing and reading many reviews of Life I knew this would be the first book I bought for my Kindle. I read many of the one-star reviews here and after having read the book feel like too many folks had the wrong expectations. What you are getting in Life is Keith Richards--the real guy--he tells you just who he is in his book: he's just some guitar player who loves his craft, wants nothing more than to perfect it and is amazed that people love him for it. This is Keith warts an all; he is unapologetic about being a junkie and while he tells some wild stories they don't have a tabloid feel to them--just very matter of fact. The whole book reads very real and raw if for no other reason than it's conversational and yes, somewhat rambling tone. I'm not sure how you tell your own story without rambling off here and there to fill in some background.    I am a huge Stones fan and so the development of the band and their music was of great interest.  Keith spends as much time in his wanderings describing how he found his playing style and sound as he does discussing the ins and outs of being a junkie and what he went through trying to finally get clean. He takes responsibility for the image he created and the outrageous behavior while acknowledging that it's also what people wanted to see and that sometimes it was just easier to play the role of Rock 'n Roll Star.    What I was left with at the end of this read was how real Keith is, what a long and wild ride he's been on, and how truly difficult parts of it must have been--which makes all of the mind-numbing drugs and booze make a lot more sense. It's not possible for someone who lives a \\"normal\\" life day in and day out to know what it's like to be pulled apart piece by piece by crazy fans or to know that nearly everyone you meet wants something from you--but Keith has narrated his tale and been generous in providing all the details he remembers as painful and hideous as some of them are. I'm grateful for the added insight.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Ok, have to admit, I was reluctant to start these books - just didn't seem to interest me, but I am a mystery lover, so finally gave in.  I'm not sorry that I did - book one is really good, but the subsequent books are better.  But you have to read book one to really get the full scope of the characters and the back ground for the rest of the story.

0385341679|5.0|MacKayla \\"Mac\\" Lane continues her quest for the magical book of the dark Sinsar Dubh that has the power to eradicate worlds.  She is no longer the frightened Irish-American exile although she still grieves for her late sister Alina; Mac enters the forbidden White Mansion of the Unseelie King who wrote the tome of evil she seeks that she believes has answers to what she truly is and may provide a light to Alina's homicide.<br /><br />She remains inside the abode with the Unseelie King much longer than she anticipated, but finally returns to Dublin with a new outlook as she now understands the essence of evil as \\"bad thinking it is good\\"; the remaining Americanized tenderness has been expunged from her soul.  Mac will do what it takes to achieve her goals.  If friends die, so be it; if she seeks strange bedfellow enemies as allies so what; yet Mac remains off kilter with each revelation she discovers about her sibling, herself and that dammed tome that is hunting down Mac and her allies.<br /><br />This is an excellent finish (not sure about whether this is truly the end as major questions remain including new ones) to a strong urban fantasy (see Dreamfever and Faefever).  The fascinating story line shows how much Mac has evolved from that naïve caring American coming to find her sister's killer only to find monsters around ever corner; thus her travails and tribulations including grief has hardened her heart and turned her tundra colder with an absolute belief that the end justifies the mean.  Exciting though there appears room for another book (re Barrons and another key player) to tie up the loose ends and an adjustment is needed to accept the evolved Mac, fans of the Fever fantasy saga will enjoy the heroines search.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I'm not a fan of TW saga but I'm a huge fan of Kristen Stewart (favorite moview - Cake Eaters, The Runaways, Welcome To The Rilyes). I bought this DVD to listen humorous comments of both Kristen and Robert and wasn't disappointed. They are both very intelligent with great sense of humor young actor. As for movie - I would consider it much much better than the previous - New Moon. I would prefer they would add more backend stories for Cullen family - only Rosalie's and Jasper are covered, while the most interesting, in my opinion, - Carlisle's is not there.  I'm owning all movies because of my daughter and actively invloved into discussion of both - books and movies. It worth owning because every movie of TW saga has it's own great moments and scenes, and you don't have to watch the whole one - just skipping to scenes you love (of course after watching the whole movie first).
B003ULUASS|5.0|I won't go into a review of the music as that has been covered by many others under the CD edition. Let me tell you about the absolutely fabulous vinyl edition,,,   TOP QUALITY !!! This edition is one of the best thought out and just plain fun vinyl sets that I have purchased recently. First off it is a double disc set, 180 gram white colored vinyl. Glossy standard weight gate fold jacket with a nice photo on either side of Katy. Full face glossy paper sleeves with candy swirl red and white print. Also included is a separate double sided glossy paper lyric sheet with the same candy theme design. Keeping with the candy theme the jacket has a noticeable smell of cotton candy. The sticker on the plastic wrap does warn of this, however it is not over powering and surely will fade quickly. 12 tracks, just like it's standard CD counterpart are spread across both discs, 3 tracks per side. This could have been put onto a single disc, but by spreading them out the manufacturer has taken a great step in giving plenty of room for the groove. Many times, even with 180 gram vinyl, 6 tracks or more are jammed onto one side which results in \\"micro grooving\\" or narrowing of the groove, resulting in loss of sound response and a tendency for the needle to jump the groove or \\"skip\\". At under the 20 dollar mark this is very much worth the money. I highly recommend this set! Also, the vinyl set of Katy Perry's other album, One Of The Boys, is also just as noteworthy with the same thought of fun and value. Please see my review for that one if you'd like to know more.   Thanks for reading my review!
076531178X|5.0|Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series is an interesting beast, but The Final Empire is a great introduction. I normally stay away from fantasy sans notable exceptions, yet a friend of mine recommended it and I trust his judgment, even if he's a fan of Robert Jordan.    But what do we really have, here? We have a magic system where a person can \\"burn\\" ingested metals to achieve certain effects. Everything is paired, and specific alloys can produce opposite reactions as their base metal. And of course it's called Allomancy. An Allomancer can push or pull metals, sooth or riot emotions, enhance his senses or his body, or any number of paired magical yields. Well, not any number, but ten. There are ten things an Allomancer can do, unless he's Mistborn, and then he can do all of them.    Got that? Good. Because Sanderson also introduced Feruchemy, yet another magic system based on metal. This second system doesn't actually consume metal, but fills it like a battery with attributes from the wearer. Like Allomancy, the same metals are used to store or release the same abilities. So a Feruchemist can make himself weaker by storing strength in pewter, only to use it in a great burst later. Unlike Alchemy, stored energy can be used in any proportion, and yes, this gets used as a plot point several times.    These things are relevant because of their rarity. In the world Sanderson has created, The Final Empire is not the pinnacle of human achievement, but something of the opposite. Ash falls from the sky, mists cloak the land, a race of slaves called the Skaa can be beaten or killed at the whim of any noble, and the Lord Ruler has forced his will upon the world for the last thousand years. It's a perfect dystopia: the Skaa literally cannot rebel, because it's the nobles that have ready access to Allomancy, and the Lord Ruler is the greatest of them all, and immortal to boot.    It's a perfect hook. By beginning with the end, Sanderson makes one question why. Why are things so terrible? How did they get that way? Why is the Lord Ruler immortal? What were things like a thousand years ago? And the questions just keep coming. And then we get introduced to Kelsier, who wants to bring it all down, free the Skaa, even return the landscape to its lush green past, all because it was his wife's dream.    And why not? What exactly to any of the characters in this world have to lose? For Vin, it's either join Kelsier's party or stay in the streets and possibly end up in a brothel. Sazed is but a steward that hides his Feruchemy behind a mysterious past, always knowing the Lord Ruler has crusaded to destroy his kind. While quite a few other characters are admittedly more shallow, they aren't exactly forgotten. Each has a believable back-story and motivation, including Kelsier's brother Marsh, who gives everything to the cause.    It actually kept me reading long past my bedtime, because it was all so hopeless---that this band of rejects could presume to bring down a government ruled by an omnipotent man who has ruled effectively unopposed for a thousand years. And what if they do? The world is still an ashen wasteland. It's good this is a trilogy, because there's no way to address everything in a single tome.    And I can't wait to finish it.
1594202842|5.0|As other people here, I have learned about this book through the WSJ article. I think that in many ways, the article is indeed misrepresenting the book, but this was probably (at least in part) intentional because this created a huge buzz. I too am raising a child as an immigrant (from France), so I enjoyed reading about the struggles that come with raising children at the crossroads of several cultures. Many people completely underestimate how different other cultures are in terms of child rearing, what is acceptable and what is not, and how hard it is to find a balance. In many ways (not all), I agree with Amy's practices, and I even took some notes while reading the book. After all, her children are very successful, and they seem very well adjusted (even Lulu!), as compared to many kids I know who were raised in a much more permissive environment.     As a working mother trying to teach my baby to read early, I can tell you that it is a lot more dedication and work to do that than to decide that \\"children are not developmentally ready to do this until they are in school\\"... In other ways, however, I would never go as far, and to Amy's credit, she successfully and apparently just in time, corrected course with her younger daughter Lulu, who wasn't responding well to classic Chinese parenting.    It takes courage for someone to share their struggles as a parent, as we all know that parenting can be dirty work, and that many fights worth fighting are not exactly 'kodak' moments. It also takes a lot of courage to reevaluate one's own parenting and realize that certain things will never work with certain chidren.... most people never do, especially not if it takes a lot of work and time.     Another thing is that many of Amy's comments, like \\"drums lead to drugs\\" are said partially tongue in cheek.., as is the story about her having dreams for Coco's future (the dog), in the sense that I think Amy is aware that some of her quirks as a parent and person are a little extreme from a westerner's point of view or may not be PC.     Overall, I thought it was a page turner for \\"Chinese\\" parents and children of such parenting.
B002OSUUPQ|1.0|If the ancient Toltecs ever heard of any of this stuff, I'll eat South America. \\"The Toltecs were dream masters.\\" Yeah, right. How on earth could the author know such a thing? These poor wretches, desperately struggling to evade jaguars and alligators, did not have the leisure even to develop individual personalities, much less to juggle obviously anachronistic cliches such as Ruiz attributes to them. Clearly he is claiming their hoary antiquity and politically correct pre-Columbian exotic character to give a false seeming of ancient wisdom to his own half-platitudinous, half-arbitrary declamations. It is in effect another version of James Redfield's ludicrous Mayan \\"Manuscript\\" in his vapid The Celestine Prophecy. Too bad Peter Coyote's wonderful voice adds undeserved gravitas to the mess.
1440503257|5.0|Yes, I'm a Harry Potter fan, too, but I also love to try making different dishes. While flipping through this cookbook, considering buying it (for it's British flavor), I saw the recipes for meat pies that included the easiest pasty recipe I ever came across and I just had to have this book. The recipes are really easy, they're fun and the results are fantastic. Anyone who buys this cookbook has to try the meat pies first. They're great snacking food and will get you hooked on the rest of the cookbook. Yum.
0765326353|5.0|After reading Sanderson's continuance of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series, and knowing that RJ left numerous notes/drafts in the case of his death, I was intrigued to see how Brandon Sanderson would do on an epic series of his own. I am glad I bought this book. The characters, especially Kaladin, have me ready to continue this series until the end! Brandon has created a beginning that will make the majority of readers impatiently wait for the next book! Well done, Brandon, well done. I look forward to the next one!
1594202842|5.0|I don't have an Amazon account,so I have to use my friend's here.Hope people read the book first before they leave a comment :)  I am a reader from mainland China. I just finish reading this wonderful book!I totally understand Amy's humor, I admire her honesty, and touched by her true love for her daughters. I was laughing, in tears, sigh... when I was reading it. Very well written, I would love to read it again!

1439181780|5.0|Rhonda Byrne's The Power is superior to her first book, The Secret, in that she gives you tons of strategies/applications to use. In The Power, she summarizes the teachings of The Secret and actually explains The Law of Attraction more fully. If you truly want to change your life, GET THIS BOOK! I just wished I had this book when I was younger. I would have had a completely different life story! But I plan to start a new life now, armed with the knowledge that's in The Power.

B004APVI1G|4.0|Of the available 3D titles I have seen this one is the most stunning. The convergence is off in a few areas but the 3D effect is fantastic. The story is fine if predictable but the enjoyment is more in the visual journey that the story telling. Anybody with a 3D setup will not be disappointed.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|I bought this CD to replace the one I borrowed from my sister.  She and I both love the BeeGees so I know she is thrilled to have it back.  If you're a BeeGees fan you'll love this collection of their best songs.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Really great series.  I can't wait for the next one.  Campy sci-fi good vs. bad action, British humor, some episodes slightly eerie.  Lots of aliens and defending the universe.  I highly recommend.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Not really much more to add from some of the other comments other than, you need to buy this set, no matter if you are huge fan of the show or just watching it for the first time. You will be hooked. Everything you could ever want in this dvd set.
1594202842|1.0|This book is horrible. The book is poorly written and culturally insensitive. The author needs to work on he critical thinking skills and I do not agree with the conclusions she reaches. Disgraceful.
B000WCDI64|5.0|I was not very familiar with her work until I saw this excellent video on a flight, and was blown away by her talent, voice and charm -- much different to the impression you would get from the tabloid images.  Several versions of the songs are head and shoulders above the album versions I have subsequently heard, for example \\"Cherry\\", which I fell love on this DVD and find completely uninteresting in the CD version.  We somehow lost our first copy, and I bought another.
B0001AUAU4|5.0|Heard this CD for the first time yesterday in a shop. Had to stop the saleswoman to find out who was the enchanting singer. Very pleasantly surprized to discover that it was the first lady of France and that she indeed has talent. Her songs have that distant, breezy quality that is so very French - an undertone that says, \\"I love this, but don't take me over seriously.\\"    I had to go right out and buy it. Putting in this CD, it is instantly four in the afternoon on a Saturday in springtime, lovely.
0596527055|5.0|I'm a software entrepreneur, having created over 15 successful commercial software programs.  But despite having over 16 years of experience with this, there were many \\"aha\\" moments reading this book and lots of other parts were confirmed by my own experiences.<br /><br /> Great book about not only myths of innovation, but (more importantly for me) information about how innovation *does* happen and how to foster it.<br /><br />Very well written, with lots of great examples.
0307272702|5.0|Buy this book!     Gary Taubes is one of my favorite writers. The shorter version of Good Calories Bad Calories, WWGF is more than just a diet book. It contains investigative journalism, sociology of science, health and nutrition data, and - most importantly - its a hell of a yarn.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|25 seconds.    That's how long it took me to turn on my kindle wireless connection and find and purchase the next book of the Outlander series (Drums of Autumn) immediately after finishing Voyager.    Gabaldon has really hit her stride in this the third of the Outlander books. The action is non-stop. So non-top that it verges on the unbelievable, but then we're talking about time traveling back and forth over 200 years here so I think we can agree that there is a need to suspend belief for a just a little while.    This book is all narrative, there is relatively little meaningful dialogue, no time spent on flowery hyperbole. In Voyager, Gabaldon tells her story at break neck speed, it's on from one disaster and narrow escape to the next. Pirates, fires, brushes with the law and Her Majesty's Navy, crocodiles and hurricanes, Voyager has them all and more to boot.    Voyager is the kind of page turner I can't put down, yes there is room for more eloquence and repose and if every book in the series were to move at this speed you'd be exhausted in a matter of weeks, however, after the relatively slow pace of Dragonfly in Amber, Voyager's style and pacing work nicely as the next step in the Outlander story.    As I said, I couldn't put it down, and 25 seconds after I was done, I had moved on to the next book, so I guess Voyager would have to have my seal of approval.
0345495004|5.0|My mother gave me this book and told me I'd love it.  I thought, \\"I'm not a huge Frank Lloyd Wright fan, so if it's about his life...\\"  Well, this book was amazing, and I've been recommending it ever since.  It is set it history when big things were happening in American architecture.  It's the story of a love affair between these two people who have their own families.  And it takes place in different cities in America and abroad.  But most of all----  I found myself waking up early and going to bed late to read this book.  The last half gets very intense, and THE END OF THE book has this amazing and unexpected HUGE turn.  I couldn't believe it.  I've never been so emotional reading a book in my life.  My boyfriend was giving me weird looks as I was gasping for air and reading it.<br />My mother and sisters and I are planning to take a trip to Wisconsin this summer to visit places featured in the book. This is a must read!!!
B002BEXG7W|5.0|I have tried the Hotel California and it is fine. I prefer to stay at the Morrison Hotel. On gold disc, the sound is incredible!
1439177783|5.0|How rare to find a seller who really cares enough to send a lovely card and sincere message!  If you want a special treat and excellent product, buy from this seller...
B001UNSZSA|5.0|Leopard on my left, Cobra on my right!!! ...Outta sight!!! Been waiting for this one on gold disc for more than 20 years. The \\"Soft Parade\\" is one of my all-time favorite Doors' song. The whole CD sounds great on gold disc. I wish I could choose any of my favorite old CDs and have them remastered on gold disc \\"on-demand\\"!
1444710338|5.0|I just received my copy and read through it.  I am starting the ATTACK phase today.  I find the content very easy to follow and also the diet.  I will check back in 3 months.
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|I bought the combo Blue Ray and regular DVD version. Awh sigh... I'm guessing the bulk Special features are only on the Blue ray side. The extra/deleted scene are not on the regular side.  So until I buy Blue Ray player I'll just have to wait to find out. But as a Twigheart who could give this movie less than 5 stars?
B004DK49DW|5.0|5 stars. Mike does it again. Unfreaking believable. Covers every valuable genre in a way only he can. Best band in America.
0316098337|5.0|This is a great book.  It is astounding how this young boy's perspective is completely different from being isolated from birth.  This is definitly a book to read from cover to back.  I could not put it down until I was finished.
0385480334|5.0|I first read Anne Frank when I was thirteen years old. Now almost 20 years later I still love it. Even this definitive edition. It definitely was about the Holocaust from a different perspective. This family in hiding did not have enough to eat, were in close quarters and could not move during the day.<br /><br />It shows she was a real girl with her own ideas, values, and discovering her sexuality. Which is quite normal for girls her age. She turns from a young girl to a teen in hiding. She gave frequent updates of radio reports and of stories their helpers told them about the treatment of Jewish people.<br /><br />This book should be read several times and at different ages in order to grasp the entirety that this book encompasses. When I was 13 I could understand her fights with her parents. When I was 18 I understood her strife with sexuality. In my twenties and subsequent readings I can go deeper into the meanings of the actual war surrounding her. She hoped to grow up and be a writer. While she never had that chance she did succeed at being a writer.
B0002ADY0Q|3.0|Back in the 70's I went to a high school in La Paz, Bolivia.  The life of my mates and me revolved around rock -- and the range of superlative bands to choose from at the time, I realize now, was breathtaking.  Uriah Heep were among those.  But so was a great fusion Bolivian band called Wara.  On their third album, Quimsa, Wara played an epic song called Nacimiento which, according to the album credits, is a traditional Andean song.  We flocked to see Wara whenever they put on a rare concert date.    Imagine our surprise, then, when on a given Friday, gathered around my rickety turntable, we throw on Salisbury (my latest acquisition), and after a few minutes...Nacimiento comes on! Or The Park, as the Heep called it.  Note for bloody note, too!  Needless to say, that's all we could talk about the rest of the evening.    Had Heep plagiarized?  We cast our minds back to the hushed up scandal Simon & Garfunkel generated when they credited the song El Condor Pasa to themselves, only to change it a few years later and amend the information to 'traditional Andean song'.      Check out Wara's version by writing 'Nacimiento Wara' on You Tube; it's got a beautiful section not used by Heep.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|The movie was good, we got the movie quick and cheap.  But I am wondering if there was something wrong with the disc because its the only disk that doesn't work properly in my dvd player.
6301442962|5.0|this is one of my all time favories. i loved the price. i could watch this movie over and over.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|Everybody everywhere knows of a ghost story; some place nearby where something goes on, or has gone on. Usually, there's a rational explanation, like the people who were frightened by a moaning entity they saw by the side of a country road one night; a white shape lingering next to a tree making a deep moaning sound. Turns out, it was at the edge of a cow pasture, and a black cow with a large white spot on its face discovered it could scratch its neck by rubbing against a tree right next to the road; at night, all you could see was the white spot. And when the cow mooed, well...I can't say I wouldn't be soiling my pants if I didn't know what it was either. More always goes on in the mind.<br /><br />In recent decades, evolving technology has made the study of energy fields possible - imagine if you could go back in time to the colonial days and use a magnet in front of the superstitious people of the time? They would be as terrified of you as the cast of characters in the film \\"Poltergeist\\" were of the thing which took their little daughter away. Everything alive and once alive has an energy field to it, this is a proven fact. At the moment of physical death, just what happens to your energy? The irony is, it's something nobody here really knows for sure, but WILL know one day. If nothing awaits us, we will know it when we ultimately \\"shut down,\\" and if we in fact do go somewhere, we will ALL find out.<br /><br />In Hooper and Speilberg's 1982 masterpiece, Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams are cast as a happy, attractive, upper-middle class couple with nice kids, who are about to go on a very rough ride. Their house is located on a spot where it shouldn't be, and an unseen being, known only to the youngest daughter, has a few tricks up it's sleeve. This is where the idea of evil becomes so disturbingly plain, in a fictional story as this and in real life. Evil invariably involves the corruption of an innocent; here it talks to this trusting innocent little girl as her friend, only to later invade and abduct, always with an invitation, per \\"Captain Howdy\\" from Blatty's story \\"The Exorcist.\\"  And in this kind of story, the real horror is in putting yourself in the position of this family - what would it be like to suddenly lose the youngest member of your family? It could be an evil spirit, as in this movie, or it could be the scummy parolee who lives down the road you warn your little ones to avoid. He's friendly, isn't he?<br /><br />In \\"Poltergeist,\\" beautiful cinematography and spectacular special effects soften the blow of this particular tragedy, but create an enhanced viewing experience nonetheless; Steven Spielberg makes fantastic-looking movies. Everything about this movie is beautiful, even the ugly shots, such as \\"Marty's Midnight Snack,\\" a genuily horrific sequence. Good lord, that's nasty. But every scene is so vivid, it just leaps off your screen; the lighting, the set design, and the camera work are of the highest standard. You are comfortable watching it.<br /><br />Some bad times have befallen some of the people in this film; in the 1980's Dominique Dunne, cast here as older daughter Dana, was absent from the first sequel, because she foolishly had a live-in relationship with a real piece of work named John Sweeney. An acting role she had for her next movie cast her as a battered woman, and the make-up department didn't need to do too much; her bruises were real. That ended when the lowlife, bottom-feeding, scum-sucking Sweeney placed his hands around her throat and throttled her to death; who does this stuff anyway? Most recently (at this writing) Lou Perryman, a longtime friend and associate of director Tobe Hooper, befell a grisley fate. In this film, he was cast as the construction worker who talks to Diane (JoBeth Williams) through the kitchen window as the yard was being dug up to install a swimming pool. In 2009 his home was invaded by an axe-wielding ex-con who hacked him to death during the burglary;what a horrible way to go! Again, evil running rampant in this world, worse, because it's the real thing.  And of course there was the doomed Heather O'Rourke. Even while she was alive and well, one could see she had this ethereal, ghostly beauty to her that set her apart. There was something to her that wasn't of this world, and that was one thing of many which made her performance in \\"Poltergeist\\" so memorable. She was THE poster-child for purity and innocence. Such a sweet little girl, a trooper to the end, never letting on just how gravely ill she was, her swollen face during the third installment of this series being the only indication of something being wrong. And by then, her illness had taken its course and she was then taken away from us; not by a fictional spirit, only to return, but by the real angel of death. And she now knows just what awaits us at the end.<br /><br />As a P.S.<br /><br />In the extras, the two - part documentary of paranormal investigations has its plusses and minuses, raising some interesting points, open-mindedly looking into the possibility of unseen presences here with us. But are we really supposed to interact with them, if they are in fact here? Without super-sensitive devices, communication is out of the question, unless you are \\"tuned in,\\" like little Carol Anne Freeling in the movie. And look what happened to her and her family. Do you really want to go there? When I die, I want to come back and spook these people good, give 'em their money's worth.<br /><br />One last point, just getting something off my chest; in the documentary, paranormal investigator Patrick Burns, I believe, is a charlatain at most, and a pseudo-intellectual at the least. He talks to the camera with his head cocked to the side, as someone who knows it all, with an edge we'll never have. He tries to flex his mental muscles by saying of Electric Voice Phenomena, \\"...EVP is an acronym...\\" No, mister genius, an acronym is a set of initials which can be pronounced as a word, like \\"Special Weapons And Tactics.\\" The initials of this phrase are s, w, a, and t. You can pronounce it; you say \\"SWAT.\\" How do you pronounce \\"EVP?\\"...\\"Evip?\\" Acronyms have nothing to do with ghosts anyway, so you just told me you like to talk meadow muffins and hope people are buying it. Too bad, because this really is an interesting topic. But the movie itself is excellent, anyway.in, evil running rampant in this world, worse, because it's the real thing.

B0042U94UQ|4.0|At first, I thought Despicable Me is one of those boring, trying-hard to be funny animated 3D movie, but I was wrong. I watched it with my sister after the package, from Amazon, arrived, and it was fantastic. The minions were high-larious, and the plots of the story were great. Evil, comedy, mother and son relationships, father and daughter relationships, even a little girl and a unicorn relationships, all are there. Nothing to say anymore, but LOL! A must see. Watch it with your friends, family, siblings, or ever with you pets and unicorns. That's how amazing this movie is. Can't wait to see \\"Hop\\", the sequel to this movie, as I know of. Correct me if I am wrong guys. So, Despicable Me : Disappointing? Not at all. I'll give this movie four stars.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Brian Wilson, the singer/songwriter who composed most of the classic music of The Beach Boys including the \\"Pet Sounds\\" album, once said he believes that music is God's voice. Surely, this is an album touched by a heavenly presence. Very rarely can one find so much: beauty and sadness, wisdom and lucidity, and pure awe-struck musical inspiration, as on \\"Pet Sounds.\\" With its gentle music-box melodies, thunderous percussion, eclectic instrumentation, and shimmering, expansive production, \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a breathtaking work of art, escorting the listener through a spiritual journey that launches exuberantly with the youthful hopefulness of \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and then travels through a magnificent emotional spectrum that catapults sky-ward during the early songs of the album but slowly descends during the second half into the sparkling sorrow of the album's coda \\"Caroline No.\\" Full of childlike wonder, but tempered with a melancholy adult maturity, \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a thrilling, heartbreaking achievement in pop music, often imitated but seldom equaled in its subtle, masterful power.
B0037QGS0A|3.0|No, I am not reviewing this film, Chloe, based on the story line of this rather mundane (and theme done before) psychological thriller (maybe) about an upper class American family (slightly dysfunctional, of course) who when doctor mom gets \\"signals\\" that professor dad is cheating on her in his (and her) old age (40-50 something, okay) who gets catch up in the thrall of what is euphemistically called a high end escort (a.k.a. \\"hooker\\", call girl, etc.). That's enough detail about the plot.     What really interests me about this film is the sub-theme, the inter-generation lesbian theme that is rather graphic in its depiction. Here escort Chloe, through a series of machinations, beds doctor mom. And old lady doctor mom (and Chloe) likes it. Now the only reason that that theme resonates with me right now is that I have recently read Lillian Hellman's play The Children's Hour and seen the film (the 1961 version under that same name). That play and film with a very different plot line nevertheless deals rather more obliquely with lesbianism, almost as if it dare not speak its name (and it doesn't in the first film version of Hellman's play, These Three). So what makes Chloe of interest is as an example of how far, at least cinematically, we have come from the days when such topics, especially the \\"hot button\\" one of inter-generation sex, hetero, lesbian or otherwise, were relegated to underground movie houses or private viewings.
0061989142|4.0|Ok, let me start by saying that as I passed by this book at a store I said to myself, \\"Who the hell does this chick think she is, like I'm going to take style advice from some 24 year old kid.\\" Long story short, yeah, she kind of showed me up! LOL.   My review is: I really liked this book; it has some great ideas and I loved the hanger idea for fitting more clothes in my closet!!! I also like how in the back of the book, she gives the name of brand of clothing she's wearing in pictures throughout the book. I like her style and she's very classy chic. I only wish that there was more clothes options, some storage ideas and a lot more pages... Overall I give a happy A.   PS... If anyone wants to know where to get these awesome hangers, I bought mine at Ross and at Marshals, 100 for $40 and I bought 2 boxes... better get some before I buy more clothes! :)
0439023513|5.0|The entire hunger games trilogy is an amazing series. What suzanne collins does is create an entire world, a fantasy world, but captures so much emotion it makes you feel as if it is real. She really shows the reader what it would be like and even weaves the message in there; we cannot always fight. A good reader for teens and adults. I loved it, she adds onto her first book and actually makes it better with Catching Fire and Mockingjay, an almost impossible task.
006176759X|4.0|This book was great! A fun and easy read. As soon as I was done with the book, I really wanted the second and third book. (They were just as good and even better.) It's like all her reality TV shows, characters, issues, incidences and good old dramas were put on scrap pieces of paper and mixed in a bowl, taken out one by one, gave the characters a different name and told the story and somehow came out realistic and interesting. Clever thinking on her part and right on key about LA life.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Easy A is the story of Olive, a nobody in high school whose life suddenly goes from silent to scandalous thanks to a cycle of rumours.  As her reputation goes from non-existent to total trollop, Olive begins to dress the part, wearing sexy outfits with a crimson \\"A\\" embroidered on them (yes, this is Scarlet Letter-status, only without Demi Moore's fake British accent).  As she lies to help boost other people's confidence, she starts to learn that just because you're well-known, doesn't mean people like you.  Overall, the story is light and quirky, with enough John Hughes references to satisfy even the biggest Brat Pack lovers.  The jokes are fresh, and the cast is excellent, keeping this fairly well-paced film entertaining from start to finish.  The cast has excellent chemistry, and the characters all seem to be believable.  This is even a film you can watch more than once, and it still hold the same charm and humour.  If you're looking for a fun comedy full of great performances and an ever-so-slightly nostalgic feel, Easy A belongs on your DVD shelf.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great looking video. The best the Alien Anthology has ever looked. If you love the Alien movies, then this is a must buy.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|WELL, I was sceptical when purchasing this at a HMV superstore on blu-ray... but I'm so glad I did.  I was really impressed with CGI and animation in this movie. I do not consider myself an expert in any way on Evangelion as I did not watch the original series, so maybe the series is better... who knows. To all the similar evangelion-ignorant readers: Buy this product as it is interesting, well made, and visually stunning.  Also, for all the music lovers, the score is tremendous. A person that overheard me watching this movie thought I was watching Lord of the Rings. Yeah.
B003YFIUW8|1.0|I very much look forward to reading this book.  It's not available for customers from Canada.....but yet..she's a Canadian author????  I hope it comes available soon!!

1400064287|5.0|I don't often find a book that is life altering, however \\"Made to Stick\\" is one of those books.  The methods of teaching, stories and research are fascinating. I have, and will continue to use what I learned from this book when compiling information and in training. The SUCCESs plan is posted on my bulletin board for reference.  I use it often. I have already shared the book with family members, teachers and co-workers.  If you like this book, you'll probably like a book by the same authors - \\"Switch.\\"  I recommend it as well.

B0040UAYI4|5.0|I have to say i was skeptical at first. But this product is pretty darn close to emulating a pc. With some tweaking, i bet you can get it even closer. I used the 1.0 firmware and it was good, but 2.0 firmware is even better and allows for greater customization with sensitivity and dead zones.  I can only compare it to the fragnstein, which was ok, but is now defunct so firmware updates are lacking.  Never used anything from splitfish and probably wont because I found this.      Some words of warning though.  People mentioned compatibility issues with keyboards and mice, but I used an old HP keyboard that I converted from ps2 to USB and it worked great. The only thing I found to be a con is that the driver/firmware software can only be used on a 32 bit windows system.  But there are ways to emulate 32 bit windows on 64 bit windows 7.     Overall, I am very happy I purchased this item because it gives me keyboard controls that brings me back to my PC gaming days of college.
B001B1CBSQ|5.0|This is an essential album, for any collection. Must listen to the entire album. Many lyrics on The Score teach valuable life lessons. Just listen closely.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I reviewed this before but had to do it again. After giving my last DVD to a friend, I purchased another copy to help jump-start my weight loss after baby #2. Not dieting, as I am the baby's only food source, but the 20 minute workout is perfect to fit in the morning before either child gets up wanting something. Not at goal yet, but so far have pommelled off the holiday pounds. :) Even though I worked out almost everyday while pregnant, this still took some getting used to. Still tough!
B003L20IFQ|1.0|I may be shallow minded, but I thought I had seen bad movies, but this one goes beyond bad. It really deseves no stars at all, but that is not an option, so I hate to even have to give one star. In short, if you really one see for yourself, watch the first and las five minutes, and there you have it, unlike myself who I'm just wishing to have my 90 minutes back.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I am going to keep this short and sweet.<br />This is certainly no literary work. It was not even particularly well written.<br />The content was sordid from start to finish to include offensive language, smoking, drinking, fornication, adultery, extreme sexual abuse, violence and more.<br />With so many wonderful books in the world, don't waste your time.
1416955070|1.0|I'm not this book's target audience, but I think certain YA novels are the best out there: Hunger Games, Harry Potter and so many others. This is a far cry from those novels.  In a nutshell, this is the story of an ordinary human girl, Clary, whose mother is abducted by what she soon discovers is the leader of the downworlders. Downworlders are demons, werewolves, vampires, and pretty much every other mythological character you've ever heard of all thrown together. Within the first few pages, Clary meets Jace, a Shadowhunter, responsible for killing demons, and his friends Alec and Isabelle. They all set out to help Clary find her mother, and the action is non stop from beginning to end. Of course, Clary learns that her mother is not the boring nobody she pretended to be, and had a life as a shadowhunter before Clary was born. There are other \\"revelations\\" that are so obvious most readers will have worked them by about the second chapter, while Clary takes until the last few pages.    Cliche as the plot is, its the characters and the dialogue that made this so painful to read. While a good novel makes the characters relatable and fully dimensional, this book's characters reminded me every moment I sloughed through this book that I was reading a novel. The dialogue consists of one wisecrack and one-liner after another, none of which were as clever as the author must have thought. The beauty of adolescent novels is the earnestness, the purity of emotions and magnitude of feeling in encountering obstacles for the first time. Clary, Jace and the others have the world-weary indifference of the especially cynical middle aged.      It's Clary that really kills this book. She's the worst of her kind. No matter how many people put their lives on the line to help her, she never experiences a moment's gratitude. Quite the opposite. She's constantly wanting to \\"smack\\" people and curse them out and berate them for not doing exactly what she wants. She's petulent, childish and eaten with jealousy. The moment her long-suffering friend (who is obviously in love with her, though she claims to have no idea) Simon devotes an instant of his attention to Isabele, Clary is crazy with jealousy, even though she has no interest in Simon. Apparently he's just supposed to wallow in his unrequired love of her forever? Clary's treatment of Isabelle is appaling. Isabelle is supposed to be this novel's femme fatale, a girl so beautiful and overtly sexual that innocent, virginal Clary is threatened and insecure next to her. It doesn't work. Isabelle is one of the only characters I could tolerate. She has moments of vulnerability, which no one else has. She welcomes Clary into her home, helps her in every way she can, and all Clary can think is how much she hates Isabelle for being beautiful. Over and over Clary obsesses over her hatred and jealousy towards this girl whose only crime is being prettier than Clary. What a message to give teen girls- it's ok to give in to hatred and jealousy as long as everyone thinks you're the sweet girl next door.     All the reviews that complained about this novel being a combination of every sci-fi fantasy there is all thrown into one sucktastic cauldron are right on. And the twist at the end? Disgusting. I don't want to give it away, but it will leave your skin crawling. Blech.
1416583432|2.0|This book had great promise... yes, admittedly, I judged a book by it's over (and the title)  I found the first 4 chapters interesting -- but then something happened -- it got way more \\"technical\\" than I expected -- and seemed to develop almost a \\"tone\\" of condescension.  I gave it to a friend who fosters dogs in the hopes that she would get more enjoyment from it than I did.    If you're science-minded, and a dog-lover, you will probably love this book.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|My wife, knowing what a gigantic nerd she married, chose this as a fantastic addition to the anniversary gifts we exchanged this year. I love it! I'm a huge fan of the show, and having my very own sonic screwdriver in my interior jacket pocket is such a treat. The interchangable nibs on the end are a bit difficult to open and easily lost, so I wouldn't recommend this as a durable toy in the hands of a child. But a man-child? Absolutely. The sounds are dead on, as is the overall look, although it's easy to be fooled by the pictures - this is definitely a toy with a plastic-y lightness that probably wouldn't survive a drop to hard flooring. In every other respect, it's a blast to goof around with, and I'd recommend it to any die-hard fans.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Well, what was intended to be a viewing of the 4 disc set over several nights became something of a marathon viewing. This production was too good to stop watching. Some of the story itself could have been taken right from current financial headlines. I won't spoil that with specific references to which headlines, because that would give away some major plot points. The script, cast, direction and cinematography were all pretty much flawless from beginning to end.<br /><br />What Dickens has to say about late 19th century English society and dealings is amazingly relevant today. I think this should be required viewing. There is a lot of insight to be gained from this story, and you'll be more entertained than you have been for a long time the whole way through, to boot. Get it!
9889979942|4.0|There's a lot of work on China this decade. I'm interested in the years between 2005-2008, when China and the world began to consider the country a true rising power. This book is a comprehensive snapshot of that time - by an American. The book is simple and straightforward, but it's important collection of imagery on a time when the world was watching and waiting for China.
B000WQW988|5.0|I never really liked Nirvana until I happened to see part of Nirvana's \\"Unplugged\\" on TV one day when I was flipping channels.  I am a \\"Baby Boomer\\" who grew up listening to Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, etc.  When I first heard \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" on the radio I didn't really like it.  About the only so-called \\"Grunge Rock\\" that I liked was Neil Young's \\"Mirror Ball\\" and some of his other work with \\"Crazy Horse.\\"  (Of course anything by Neil Young is great).  And Nirvana Unplugged is great.  I bought both the DVD and CD; they are both 5 star recordings.  If you are a \\"Classic Rocker\\" like myself and think you don't like Nirvana, watch this one. You will love it.
B0049OSQ18|3.0|The Decemberists have fallen into the trap most bands do when they succeed - they become boring.  Repetitive cords, a dull drum line, and unimpressive lyrics blend together to form a short, uninspired album.  There aren't even any special gems hidden within the mediocre.      Some say you shouldn't compare it to their old work because it's a new sound.  That doesn't make sense, since the EP didn't sound like Crane Wife didn't sound like Picaresque yet they all sounded fantastic.  I will compare it to their earlier body of work and say that this comes up very short.    If you compare it to other recently released work, Broken Bells blows this out of the water.  If you're looking for the folksy feel, Darius Rucker (Hootie) just put out an amazing \\"country\\" but not quite country album.  If you want great lyrics, Rogue Wave makes Colin Malloy sound like a kindergartener.  Some really amazing albums have been released in the last 6 months and this is not it!     Do you buy it?  I can't really answer that. I don't hate it, but I don't see it surviving the test of time on my playlist like the older stuff has.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|We bought this product from Amazon and it was broken where the plastic head support goes into the left ear-piece. We returned this item back to Amazon who did a quick and impressive refund of the money. But overall, the plastics used and the workmanship of this head set left much to be desired. After a couple of weeks, I purchased this same product from Future Shop, Canada, it worked fine for about 2 weeks, but then one of the ear sets developed a static / low sound problem and we had to return that as well. However, as long as it worked, it was excellent sound quality, but the problem lies with the design and quality of plastics used. That definitely needs to improve.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|I just finished Shadowfever and...WOW!!! Predictability is not a word you could ever use to describe KMMs' Fever series. In fact, this last book is a doozy. Although, a couple of my theories turned out to be true in the end, it was never a straight and easy path to get from here to there. I can honestly say that there was NEVER a time I had this book completely figured out. Just when I thought I'd gotten close, the story took a sharp turn and completely screwed up my speculations. Duped is a good word to use. I thought I was so smart--had it all figured out--only to discover that I was duped several times by the storyline. And it was refreshing!     Shadowfever delivered a fantastic and vividly created world with a suspenseful storyline. The characters are deliciously intriguing and you find yourself getting emotionally invested in them. From Barrons jack-assy men, and headstrong Mac, to the imperious Fae, and many other interesting and new additions, there is no lack in character development. And I was surprised at the amount of humorous situations (most of it dark) and dialogue created in this last book. Although all the books in this series have comical situations blended with interesting dialogue, this one beats the rest hands down.     Like I said in my other reviews. This is NOT a sparkly fairy tale about love and tiny beings with gossamer wings and fairy dust. It is a dark story with highly evolved, ancient and otherworldly beings that have been a part of our human world before the record of time itself. Beings so advanced they don't even consider the human race to be sentient. With any story about light and dark, good and evil, you find yourself worrying for the main character in the story. Fearful of where they're going in their journey and what choices they are going to make. Are they damning themselves? Are they being fooled into \\"batting for the wrong team?\\" Are good and evil really what they appear to be? And who can they trust? Along with death, acceptance and love, those are some of the many issues Mac is faced with.     I have to admit, I got worried a few times in this story. I had REALLY high expectations when I started Shadowfever and sometimes that can totally ruin a book when it doesn't deliver. Some series are great right up to the ending and then fizzle out with a conclusion that leaves you unimpressed. Not so with Shadowfever. It was... satisfying, but over too soon. In fact, I was really saddened when it ended. I wanted more pages to magically appear at the end of the book so I could read it into infinity. But the ending was good. Both closure (to an extent) and... rebirth? And the journey was EPIC!     Cons:  Yes... I have some. After I finished Shadowfever I waited around a few days to give myself time to come down from my high and really review how I felt.  Just in case I might say, Hey, but what about this, that and that other thing?  As I suspected, I did just that.    There were strings left untied and I didn't get ALL the answers I wanted.  If were being perfectly honest here... I felt a little let down, frustrated and perturbed by that fact.  I'd waited so long for answers to my many questions only to get some of them answered and many others left dangling.    My other beef is... we're supposed to be judging Barrons by his actions during this series and not his past... but he and his men appear to be leaning closer to the evil side of things and that makes it hard for me to justify liking them.  Which is hard, because you really DO want to like them.  You almost can't help yourself and that makes for some really conflicted feelings.  I don't like that KMM has created such intriguing characters and then not given us enough rationale to make them WORTH liking. Just like I feel conflicted for liking Dexter ((who is a serial killer for crying out loud!!!))  I know Karen's goal was to create characters with shades of grey who are neither good or evil, hero or anti-hero.  But I still think she couldgive some rationale to those characters without upsetting that balance and tipping them one way or the other.  Right now... they appear to be tipping AWAY from the light.  But that's just my opinion.  Hopefully she will rectify this.    All that aside, KMM did mention that she wanted to leave some things up to the interpretation of the reader.  Which drives me nutz!  I prefer complete closure.  That being said, I realize in order to move on with another 3 book arc in the series--which is what KMM has planned--some things can't be tidied up with complete answers without also giving away your next storyline.  I guess I'm okay with that.  I originally gave this series 5 stars when I first wrote my review.  Even with the issues I have with it I'm only murdering 1 star and I do it with much difficulty because I feel the storytelling, world building, character development, mystery, suspense, and over all epic adventure that it's taken me on make up for the rest of my issues.    Pros:  Good story telling that captures the imagination is not always neat and tidy. Life is chaotic and does not always provide you with the answers you desire. A book is a success if you find yourself thinking about it hours, days and even weeks after you've finished reading (Obviously, for me, that's the case).  And it's a REAL success if you find yourself going back to read it again (And I would do just that). That is exactly what was saving this book from getting a lesser rating from me. The promise of more to come, some possible redemption or rationale for Barrons and his men that would navigate them closer to the middle between good and evil, and the fact that I would reread the whole series all over again.    All in all, I REALLY loved this series and it's complexities. It's wonderfully written and proves KMM is an amazing writer. Who else can write a book that has so much mystery, foreshadowing and mirroring going on that it's almost a puzzle for your brain.  You can literally reread it and find things you previously missed or took for granted.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  And, in fact, I challenge you to read the first novel and stop there.  I bet you'll find that pretty difficult, if not impossible.  It's addictive.    *****SPOILER ALERT BELOW THIS POINT*****            *****SPOILER ALERT*****    Everyone missing the romance found in Moning's previous series will not be disappointed. Shadowfever delivers. But it's not a delicate, tender romance with chocolate, flowers and pretty rainbows. This is Barrons and Mac we're talking about. The constant Jack-Ass and headstrong glamour girl turned warrior. They're relationship has caused many a reader to toss books across rooms and release breaths of total exasperation. Because Mac and Barrons are stubborn, obstinate characters that refuse to reveal any vulnerability by being the first to admit to having feelings of any kind for each other. As one would expect from a romance between Mac and Barrons, it's... well... frustrating, interesting, wild, dark and crazy EROTIC to the nth degree. A reread of all the good scenes is recommended and HIGHLY unavoidable.    Enjoy!

B00005B36H|5.0|This is an album that pulls you in and takes your mind on a journey, and when it eventually ends, you find yourself catching your breath while you ponder your very existence. It is an album that transcends everything we have come to believe about music. There are long, dark passages that explore landscapes that cannot be seen by the naked eye, alongside moments that burst with energy and propel the listener into a higher state of awareness. Danny Carey's drumming is beyond comparison, delving into otherworldly time signatures with a fiery yet controlled intensity. Justin Chancellor's bass lines unravel like a waking cobra (listen to Schism and Reflection) before lashing out with a venomous mysticism. Adam Jones avoids conventional guitar riffs/solos and instead sculpts spiraling arpeggios and driving minor chords that create an atmosphere that is both beautiful and sinister. And finally, the lyrics of Maynard James Keenan speak of reaching a higher reality and expanding our potential as human beings, opening our minds to the infinite possibilities within our grasp.  The musical depth on this album is nothing short of groundbreaking. You don't listen to Lateralus, you experience it. For anyone who wants to explore musical and mental territory that is unique and largely untapped- you will not be disappointed.
0553582038|2.0|I am so sick of authors with gigantic unfinished works. Someone gave the first 3 books to me for Christmas, and I purchased the fourth myself. I've enjoyed the series up to this point, but when I came online to find the next, i discovered it isn't yet published.     This reeks to me of Robert Jordan.  I am sick of unfinished series! There should be a frigging warning label on the cover of the first novel that the series isn't finished.  I am on the verge of just stopping where I am in book 4 and waiting for the series to be finished before I read anymore......  If it ever does get finished.

The book contains wonderful and interesting information for all Harry Potter fans out there and also includes samples or freebies as you read through the pages (Marauder's Map, Yule Ball Programme, Ministry of Magic Identity Card, etc). A great read and a must-have for the Harry Potter fan!
B002ZG98FU|4.0|Make no mistake - despite being surrounded by a large cast featuring film icons with decades of experience - this is Rachel McAdams' movie.  The film is similar in tone to countless romantic comedies of the last two decades, but other than a few superficial dates, romance takes a backseat to the story of McAdams' Becky Fuller.  Becky is in her late twenties and, apparently, has WANTED to be the producer of a big morning news show ever since she was a little girl.  My house has been filled with four daughters and I knew of no girls with similar aspirations, but McAdams makes you believe that Becky is pursuing her dream and sacrifice sleep and boyfriends to reach her goal.  One of the great charms of the film is that it makes such a single-mindedly devoted to career person likable.  In a different movie the sacrifice-everything-for-career character would be a villain. McAdams' performance makes you want her to succeed.<br /><br />The start is not promising.  Becky is working for a 4 a.m. local New Jersey show, and expecting a promotion when she is, instead, fired by a producer who writes in her references that she is the \\"most talented producer I ever had to fire.\\"  Becky floods New York with applications and is finally invited to interview for the morning show on the fictional IBS.  Jeff Goldblum is excellent as the IBS executive who interviews the heroine and \\"encourages\\" her by pointing out that although their show is the worst, by far, of all the network morning shows, her qualifications are among the least-impressive of the various candidates.  McAdams gives a passionate plea and Goldblum makes the decision of a smart Human Resources people everywhere: he hires the candidate with the passion rather than the best credentials.<br /><br />Becky is thrown into the hot water and in the first staff meeting you think she is in over her head, but she surprises the staff - and the film's viewers - by being on top of her game immediately.<br /><br />Diane Keaton is terrific in a pretty thankless role, as the \\"face\\" of \\"Daybreak\\" for years, who has seen the show a constantly revolving door for co-anchors and new executive producers, the whole time with \\"Daybreak\\" at the bottom of the ratings.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is the biggest name in the cast, as Mike Pomeroy, the IBS anchor who for years was a peer with Rather and Brokow, but was fired as anchor of their evening news and is now playing out the end of a six million dollar, two year contract.  Patrick Wilson, as another IBS producer and ersatz love interest, warns Becky that Pomeroy is the \\"third worst person in the world.\\"  Becky is looking for anything to boost ratings, and Pomeroy's contract allows him to be forced into the morning show.<br /><br />This film lightly brings up the debate between \\"News vs Entertainment\\", tackled more seriously in films like \\"[[ASIN:B0045HCJIA Network]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000EBIOVC Good Night, and Good Luck.]]\\" and even in comedies like \\"[[ASIN:B00000K3CS Broadcast News]]\\".  Pomeroy grates against being forced away from legitimate news. But while this is still a legitimate debate for evening news, I doubt anyone has a problem with morning news shows featuring segments with cooking and music and weathermen riding roller coasters. Spunky Becky tells grumbling Mike \\"the debate between news and entertainment has been going on for DECADES!  Guess what?! Your side LOST!\\"<br /><br />The film's conflict comes when Goldblum informs McAdams that Daybreak's already bad ratings have fallen even lower since adding the resentful Pomeroy, and the network intends to cancel the show in six weeks.  Can perky Becky pull Daybreak's ratings up and save the show?  Will Pomeroy quit sulking long enough to join the team?  The film doesn't generate much suspense, but it has a few surprises, a delightful cast, and makes you glad to be in its company as you arrive at the final destination.role, as the \\"face\\" of \\"Daybreak\\" for years, who has seen the show a constantly revolving door for co-anchors and new executive producers, the whole time with \\"Daybreak\\" at the bottom of the ratings.

This is the perfect gift for every Celine Dion fan and must have for collectors.
B001RNI1Z0|5.0|This book provided a lot of concrete suggestions for how to achieve your goals, such as ways to meditate, writing affirmations, particular prayers that one could go through. The writing was very positive and I feel like this is a book you can turn to repeatedly when you feel helpless and at a loss as to what to do.<br /><br />The idea I found most interesting is that while the subconscious mind controls everything, including your physical body, it is incapable of assessing the validity of a particular idea or situation. To illustrate this point, the author reminds you of how your subconscious mind unquestioningly accepts all kinds of weird scenarios that are introduced in dreams. It is only the conscious mind that has the ability to detect fallacies or even begin to exercise that level of judgment. That's why you have to somehow control this powerful subconscious mind lest it sabotage your goals. That is, if you want to achieve one thing but you subconsciously believe you do not deserve it, then your subconscious mind will affirm your belief by sabotaging your efforts. Therefore to achieve anything you need to get your subconscious mind to cooperate and agree with your conscious goals. Trying to tame or communicate with this illogical beast is difficult and requires practice, and this book begins to instruct you on how to work towards this. The book emphasizes that the whole process requires time and work.<br /><br />I do not think this book offered a scientific basis for any of its ideas but instead relied on numerous personal anecdotes. It also would often refer to a higher power so if you object to that you may want to turn to another book on self hypnosis.
B003KUSUSQ|5.0|This new album is awake and fresh.  I have been telling all my friends to purchase this album.  I accidently got the edited version, but wound up giving it to someone who was looking for that version, and quickly replaced it with the explicit version.  No offence taken to the language because that is apart of who Marshall is.  The words on all his tracks hits home as I can see there is a recovery in him and what he sings about.  I play this album repeatedly and LOUD.  Good job Marshall.

B001OBT3FC|4.0|First, I agree with all those superlatives other reviewers have been lavishing on the performance and the wonderful sense of presence in the Musikverein. The video, all the more so in Blu-ray, adds immeasurably to the overall experience, musical and otherwise. Not only does one have a seat better than anyone in the house, even in that superb concert hall, but a student can get the benefit of a closeup view of Ms. Mutter's marvelous technique. Also, seeing the fervor with which the musicians of the Berliner Philharmoniker delved into the music sent chills up my spine--the kind of commitment on display here, by musicians who could play this stuff in their sleep but chose instead to play with the enthusiasm of people playing it for the first time in their lives, was truly exciting.<br /><br />I did find some unfortunate flaws in the engineering of this Blu-ray, however--at least in the copy I received; and I have carefully checked my setup, comparing with other nominally identically encoded Blu-rays; and I have discovered that there are no sub-woofer channels active. It's not PCM 2.1 or PCM 5.1, but rather PCM 2.0 and PCM 5.0. For those of us who depend upon a standard satellite-speaker/sub-woofer setup, this can be a problem, although there are various workarounds, depending upon the configuration of one's A/V system. In my case, for example, it is necessary to select the PCM Stereo track on the Blu-ray and then let my receiver simulate the surround, synthesizing a woofer track in the process. Those who use full-range stereo speakers, and not a sub-woofer, or those whose sub-woofer connects by speaker wires (rather than, or in addition to, a .1 [LFE] line-level connection) should have no problem, however.<br /><br />The engineering problems do not end there, though. I found that, first, there is no access to a \\"Top Menu.\\" When using the Pop-up menu as an alternative, I discovered that once in the Audio setup portion, I could not move to another function such as \\"Chapters\\" or \\"Subtitles,\\" UNLESS I navigated back through the audio choices, thus being forced into PCM Stereo (not surround) whether I wanted it or not. Once one leaves the pop-up menu, (s)he can then push the \\"audio\\" button on the remote and then set the audio to surround mode.<br /><br />Except for the lack of bass (\\"other than that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?\\"), I thought the audio was quite spectacular. When playing the surround tracks, there is not much difference in the sound of the orchestra; and I don't notice a great deal of extra hall ambience; and perhaps that is as it should be. The surround mostly comes into play during the applause or during quiet passages, when one becomes aware of the \\"air\\" around him or herself; but that's a nice touch.<br /><br />The poor technical \\"authoring\\" of the Blu-ray is almost enough to make me suggest getting the DVD instead, assuming it does not suffer from the same problems; however, if you have a large-screen TV--one on which you can see a dramatic difference between Blu-ray and DVD--I still recommend the Blu-ray because, even though the technical glitches are inexcusable, they are also surmountable.UNLESS I navigated back through the audio choices, thus being forced into PCM Stereo (not surround) whether I wanted it or not.

B004DK5CYM|5.0|While \\"Secretariat\\" won't win any awards for being 100% faithful to the story of Big Red and his owners, \\"Secretariat\\" manages to be powerful, corny, moving and just down right entertainment. \\"Secretariat\\" is from the old fashioned school of filmmaking where you actually get to root for the underdogs and see them win. A confession--I'm not much of a racing fan and I really enjoyed the movie which focuses on overcoming difficult odds to reach your goals.<br /><br />Big Red (his real name)came from a family of winners but winners who had speed but not stamina. When housewife Penny Chenery (Diane Lane)inherits Meadow's Stables from her ailing father (Scott Glenn)she faces challenges immediately; Meadow's Stables is stumbling financially. She sticks to her decision against the wishes of her brother (Dylan Baker) and her husband (Dylan Walsh)to raise and race Big Red. She knows however that she needs a trainer as hungry to win as she is and picks Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich)who must overcome his own issues to successful train Big Red to go all the way to the Triple Crown.<br /><br />Directed by Randall Wallace (writer of \\"Braveheart\\" and director of \\"We Were Soldiers\\" and \\"The Man in the Iron Mask\\")\\"Secretariat\\" races by compressing the true story into an exciting two hours. Wallace gets the details of the 60's and early 70's right and the performances are all authentic feeling without any showiness.<br /><br />The film looks quite nice in its Blu-ray debut. The film has nice detail and depth. Colors pop and the cinematography color scheme nicely suggests the time the film is set in (1968-1973).<br /><br />The film comes with both the Blu-ray edition as well as a DVD and both versions have special features  (though not exactly the same ones) which include the following: \\"Choregraphing the Race\\"; \\"A Director's Inspiration and A Conversation with the Real Penny Chenery\\"; an audio commentary by the director; \\"Secretariat Multi-Angle Simulation\\" which allows you to relive a recreation of the breathtaking race from multiple angles. We also get 4 deleted scenes.<br /><br />The DVD has a featurette on the making of the film entitled \\"Heart of A Champion\\". Three deleted scenes and a music video.<br /><br />\\"Secretariat\\" is entertaining if not entirely factual in relaying the story of a rare and talented race horse as well as the owner, trainer and rider who believed in him.

B003L20ICE|1.0|I cannot understand they hype over this work - the characters are paper thin, the quality of acting questionable, but most disturbing are the negative images that are conveyed in this work about single sex parenting. The inter-relationships are totally disfunctional and the \\"message\\" - if there is indeed one - is confused.  I would not have expected such badly crafted material  to have been offered by a lesbian director.  I am just so pleased and happy that my daughter who has two mothers has the privilege of being a totally whole and rounded person in the middle of a normal and loving extended family environment.  This was an opportunity  to show mainstream that single sex families can be just as  functional as \\"traditional\\" families are perceived as being. That opportunity was lost - in spades!
B0041KKYD8|5.0|The thing that disturbed me the most about the original is the fact that the rape just continues on and on and on and on. You get to feeling sick and think it will never end. I think had it just been one rape, it wouldn't have been as depraved as it felt. I'm curious to see how much like the old one this new one will be. The old Last House on the Left was similar to the remake and i thought it was really good. I guess we'll evaluate this one when it comes out in a couple of weeks.

B0036S4B2G|4.0|Grove comes across as a competitive, systematically rational man whose philosophy is to identify, confront, and welcome change. He writes that the main danger is in \\"standing still,\\" and this book is valuable to me because it made me think more about how to apply this philosophy to my life.<br /><br />The first ~70% of this book is the story of Intel's shift from the memory business to microprocessors when they realized they couldn't keep up with Japanese competition. Lessons gleaned from this experience are that when confronted with big change (what Grove calls a 10X force, for example a big competitor like the Japanese arising, the Walmart business model, the advent of the internet) you have to try to identify if you are in a strategic inflection point (by listening to prophets he calls Cassandras and those in the periphery who are more in touch with the world such as sales people) and react appropriately (by changing your product, your business model, your consumer, etc). Grove does not give a fool proof way of identifying if you are actually facing a strategic inflection point but he does outline some general, practical, common sense guidelines about how to think through these issues for your business. It's interesting to read his analysis on the impact of the internet for Intel (this book was written in the late 90s).<br /><br />He also coaches you through the psychology of addressing change. Because most people look back and wish they'd made a change earlier, he emphasizes conviction and clarity. He advises us to change when we're doing well in our current state because then we have the momentum to successfully handle the inflection point when it arrives. Lastly he emphasizes the importance of not clinging to old strategies, that success is dangerous because it can create inertia, and thus often new managers are brought in not because they are better thinkers but simply because people can make better decisions if they are not married to the old ways.<br /><br />To me the most interesting, resonating, applicable part of the book was the last part where he writes we are each CEOs of the business of our own careers. He advises us to use the ideas he had outlined for corporations and apply them to our own lives so that we are ready for change when it inevitably arrives.<br />My take away from this book is that I should keep make an extra effort to keep informed about opportunities outside my immediate industry and company. When you are deep in the trenches you get sucked into local concerns and it's easy to miss out on what the Cassandras are seeing. Grove had said upper management is often the last to know when a 10x change has occurred and I see how easy this can be a danger in my own life, how I could become absorbed in achieving outdated goals. Persistent re-evaluation of the relevance of my goals will help prevent me from getting stuck in a state that is not high growth.eresting, resonating, applicable part of the book was the last part where he writes we are each CEOs of the business of our own careers.

B000058A1G|5.0|I dont honestly know how this band did`nt catch on and have hit after hit.  In my opinion they were just as good as any other top notch 60s band if not better than some that made it to being house hold names.  I cant compare reggie kings voice to any other and theres a great mix of covers and original titles on this album as well as having a great info poster/booklet with it(which you probably dont get if you just download the album)call me old school but i do like to know what year and other info while listening to music
B004EAQNO4|5.0|Love all of M. Night Shyamalan (spelling?) movies but this is the first movie of his that I probably will not watch a 2nd time, only because the film is all about building suspense and there's not really as much relationship building and character building (I didn't think) as the other movies he's made. This movie was more about building suspense and so then, once you know what happens, (like in a horror movie), you're not as likely to watch the film a 2nd time. I own all of this director/writer's movies and I watch most of over and over again, but this is one that I just rented once, and will probably not watch again for the same reason no one watches horror movies more than once - it's not nearly as thrilling the 2nd time around. Lady in the Water and The Village are examples of M. Night Shyamalan films I will watch again and again.
B003E6K1VK|4.0|System: iPhone4, FiiO E7, Sony MDR EX700LP earbuds.    I live in Hawaii and have no TV but listen to a lot of music.      Pros:  * Much higher fidelity than the iPhone4 amp, which was better than my iPhone3G amp which preceded it.  * Ease of use, I can have it in my pocket and make the adjustments to it that I need, without even looking at it.  * Long battery life. My first use was 10 hours straight and it still had most of it's charge left.  * After 10 hours of listening, there was no eardrum fatigue that would come from distortion.  * It seems to be the only product of its type of market right now - it can fit in your pocket and it has bass boost.  * A perfect companion to the iPhone.    Cons:  * The bass boost colors vocals.  A firmware update to make the bass boost cutoff frequency user adjustable, or just reduce the cutoff frequency, would be greatly appreciated.  * The highest setting on the bass boost also boosts the overall volume, the other 3 bass settings don't.  This requires adjusting volume if you go into and out of the highest level of bass boost.  Again, a firmware update would be great.    Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|This is my fourth Josh Groban CD, and it is my favorite by far.  I especially like \\"A Higher Window\\" and \\"If I Walk Away\\".  This is much better than his Awake album.
B003ZK58WM|4.0|I am curious. I thought books that need not be printed, shipped, etc would be at an attractive price. Seems like a lot of money was eliminated from the distribution costs including the cost of a retail store to house the books.    What justifies an ebook at $20. or more? I mean I can get a paperback for what sub-$10, no?    Help me out what am I missing as a newbie to Kindle reading.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I love this series and this book was amazing.  It answered all my questions on what was going on.  I loved the ending.  Thank you Karen for letting us into the world of Mac and Jericho.  It was a fantastic ride.
B0042U94UQ|3.0|I can't really say why I didn't enjoy this as much as I enjoy the Pixar stuff. Perhaps it is because this is truly for kids with no overtones for adults.
B002V9L5IE|5.0|A few days ago, while driving to work, I turned on the radio and heard a song that immediately caught my attention. While occasionally I do happen to find music pieces that give me goosebumps, bring tears of delight to my eyes and cause me to feel a sudden surge of energy and optimism (and that is how love-at-first-sight is often depicted), it is still rather rare that I react instantly and with such intensity to a song. That particular one though was so beautiful, rich and majestic that I found no rest until I discovered who the artists were: Asaf Avidan and the Mojos, an Israeli group. I rushed and bought one of their albums (this one), a little anxious that I will be disappointed, that that one song I heard on the radio would be the only one I will ultimately love.     Boy was I wrong! From the very first sound I was immerged into a fantastic realm of sounds and sensations; complex and laborious in a sublime way, melodious and dazzlingly colorful (yet not naïve), covering a psychedelic array of notes, tempos, keys and sound nuances, it seems more of a music produced by feelings than by instruments. Sometimes such music can not only be heard, but felt too, as a warm sea traversed by cold currents, mostly calm and sometimes tumultuous.   There are many stories told by the songs of this album - in music as well as in words. Closing my eyes and not really listening to the lyrics (which afterwards I discovered to be beautiful too), during some songs I could easily imagine myself in a pub full of smoke and blue feelings; other songs transported me to a lonely beach washed by a primordial ocean; two others left me feeling the shapeless but ultimately sad emotions of an ugly, rejected little boy, while others simply zapped me to the front raw of a heavy-metal concert.   Although some parts of the music sounded familiar and reminded me of well known and very different singers, bands and music writers - just to name a few and demonstrate the variety: from Pink Floyd to Tom Waits, from Gershwin (yes him) to Aerosmith, from Vaya con Dios to Queen, from Leonard Cohen to Led Zeppelin (interweaving gentle vocals with sudden hard-rock explosions), from Janis Joplin to Linda Perry and even from Annie Lennox to Kate Bush - Asaf Avidan's music is still particularly his. In fact, is so original and distinctively his that I found hard to catalog it: it's something between hard-rock, church-spiritual-gospel, swing, jazz, classical, blues and progressive. The most important characteristic though derives not so much from the style as from Asaf's unique and fantastic voice.         I truly love this music, this artist and this band and warmly recommend this album.
B000ICM0YY|2.0|While I grant that \\"Boxed set\\" is not specifically billed as a complete set of Beethoven Sonatas, it would imply that it was It was not in fact a complete set, missing, at minimum Opus 2 No 1, Opus 111, and Opus 14, No 1.
B000065U1N|4.0|After reading the book and watching this movie, I wondered how this incident might live on in the hearts and minds of ordinary Somali's. Perhaps the men boast about how they came together as brothers that day to repulse the forces of the most powerful nation on earth. Maybe the women recall loved ones who died or were injured. And I suppose some of the elders may wonder if today they'd be better off if they'd discovered some way to allow America to help them. But I don't know any Somali's and lack a context for understanding their perspective.  Maybe someday someone will make a movie like Eastwood's \\"Letter's from Iwo Jima\\". Until then, I just wish them well ...
0307454541|3.0|Relax and just enjoy the trilogy.  Stories get better with each book and the last half of the third is a roller coaster ride.  If you need more than pulp fiction -  where the story is just OK, the characters are only midly interesting, and the pop culture event takes some time to understand, pass on Larsson's efforts.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Love this game it's so fun. My 2 and 3 year old love it too. They are too little to play by the rules, but they love putting the pieces on the board. It's like a giant, exciting puzzle to them.

B0047O2HJW|1.0|Ordered 2 boxes of this item. 1 thru Airmail & 1 thru Ship-freight, from USA to the Netherlands. The first came in damaged, the second I haven't received yet after 5 weeks. All in all a box full of nice Dylan classics, but I want it now!
B000N3SSVM|5.0|This is my favorite knife album by far.  What sets it apart is that they actually change their live songs in ways that make the album really interesting to listen to. Great sounds!  Definitely weird, but that's to be expected.  The DVD is a treat as well. They match the audio with some intense visuals.  It's perfect.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie was awesome. The acting was superb. I applaud Temple Grandin for overcoming all the obstacles she encountered. An excellent movie for families to enjoy together.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Where to start?! All around great writing, characters, actors, and comic timing. I've already watched and rewatched! Looking forward to the complete second season.<br />The product shipped very quickly and came in great new condition.
0767802519|2.0|Not even a beautiful and talented child (Natalie Portman) could save this preposterous story.  It amazes me that anyone could take this film seriously, especially Oldman's over the top performance as a narcotics officer.  Put this in the category of Urban Fantasy.  Portman fans should take a look at Beautiful Girls, a small movie that she stole a couple of years later.
0316044695|1.0|I am going to make this brief due to time restrictions but I felt I should warn ANY TRULY LITERATE PERSON SAVE YOUR MONEY! I have had more than one book that I had to trudge through but I still completed the book.  I got about 1/3 of the way into chapter 2 and I couldn't take anymore torture.  I wonder if this book was ever edited.<br /><br />This is a eulogy for the authors comrads which he lost.  I have lost friends also (Vietnam) and I respect his efort.  The authors lack of command of the english language and theology are both painful to read through.  I kept feeling that much of the material in the pages I read were filler to make the book bigger.  His crude language was repulsive and someone should inform him, reguarding his inferance that his God is better than their God, that the God of Islam is the same God as both the Christians and Jews.  If he would do the right research he would find that the realy early Christians refered to God as Allah also.  He says this is Gods war does he realize that the ten commandments says \\"Thou shalt not kill\\" ?  The terrorist say that this is a religious war but they are radical fundamentalist and that is the most dangerous thing on our planet. There are respectable Imoms who speak out against these killers and say that they \\"are going to hell\\" The Crusades are a great example of terrorism on the christian side.  He should have  informed himself about the myth of weapons of mass destruction.  Despite this display of ignorance, the main reason I shun the book is it was boring!
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Shockingly awful.  I've long been generally amazed how Hollywood can churn out so many mediocre movies upon which so much money was spent and so much talent  lavished.  It is utterly stupefying how so-called professionals -- producers, directors, writers -- can so thoroughly degrade a franchise such as the once-great Sex And The City.  This installment could hardly have been worse if it were deliberate sabotage.  That the actors went along with this particular travesty may be testament to how horrendous the economy has been -- they must've been absolutely desperate for the paychecks to sign onto this trash.  They surely must be embarrassed by being associated with this film.  A shame and a waste.  The more I think about it, this movie rates only one star.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Short stories are probably my favorite story medium. Where there are times that I love a long sprawling epic allowing ample time for plot & product development I favor short stories. The skill it takes to create something impactful in such a short amount of space always fascinates me. I also like how a skillful author can narrow down their scope to focus minutely on one topic or theme. This book by Jennifer Egan is a break from my typical short story reading as it is almost like a Mosaic where each short story is part of a much larger, deeper story. The stories all circle around Bernie, a music producer & his assistant Sasha as well as people who come in and out of their lives. There are stories ranging from when Bernie & Sasha are both young and old, there is quite an age difference between the two if you were wondering. The first story is about how Sasha has an uncontrollable urge to steal small items that are important to their owner and much later in the book there is a story from her youth that gives a curious insight into why. There is another reoccurring character Kitty, a movie star who escapes from an attempted rape in one story that helps catapult her from a b actress into a star. The actual story of the attempted rape is told by the reporter who was in jail for it after we had already gotten to know how he was dealing with life after prison. I'd actually read the second story in the book about Bernie when he's lost his producing touch in an issue of Granta last year and didn't realize that it would be in this book. When I reread it I enjoyed it just as much, which says a lot.    The order of the stories may not be the most important part of the book but it's important as the author plays with our emotions about the characters as the stories progress in their non linear sometimes random feel. The impression after finishing the book is that the order is in no way random and feels preconceived as part of the concept but I'm only guessing no that point. The writing style is good, with a lot of quotes that I found worth saving.    Finding books like this that make me look at something I love in another way is fun and why I like exploring authors. It reminds me of one of those pieces of art where tiny pictures make up a face from a distance. On an unrelated note this is the first book I've read on my brand new Kindle received as my big gift this Christmas and I liked reading on it. Took a little getting used to but I can't say how much I love the built in dictionary that will give the definition just by putting the cursor by the word.
B004GCJ11C|3.0|inspirational for sure, but don't puchase kindle version. much of the text is impossible to read due to the formatting. literally could not read sidebars wih lists of suggested foods, testimonials, or 21 day cleanse. if you plan to use as a diet tool, spend your money wisely and purchase the book in the traditional format.
0393072231|1.0|This book is a mixture of superficial history and apologetics for short selling.  The author barely explains what shortselling is, and spends most of his time either on those parts of financial history that interest him, or defending short selling.  Short selling has some benefits, no doubt. After reading the book, I still don't know what these are.  And no drawbacks to shortselling are mentioned. What about rumor mongering?  Does is exist? Surely short sellers have an incentive to create rumors. No mention of this.  I was really looking forward to this book. But it is a complete bust.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I had always heard of Janelle Monae, but never really purchased any of her music.  Then a friend of mine told me to go get her CD the day it came out, and just listening to him, I bought it on a whim.  When I first heard it I was IMMEDIATELY thrown into this world that I cannot describe to this very day!  Her musical arrangements are so polished and crisp that I feel like I'm listening to a soundtrack to a futuristic musical of heartbreak, rebellion, and all sorts of things.  Not to mention, Ms. Monae's storyline makes the songs even more interesting, it's always fun to figure out what character is singing what song, which shows the extreme vocal talents and abilities she's capable of.  Well dont Janelle, you are outstanding!!!!  This is without a doubt my favorite album of 2010, I hope to see you with Grammys in your arms on the big night!!
B001G9LVGG|5.0|I ordered this cd several weeks before Christmas. I ordered other ones at the same time from different sellers on Amazon, and EVERY ONE CAME WELL BEFORE CHRISTMAS. I STILL did NOT have this cd by the middle of JANUARY! I tried to contact the seller and was given a complete runaround. Finally they told me they 'had it back', because it was 'undeliverable' to my address. This is CRAP, and a complete lie! NEVER have I ever had a problem with an Amazon order, and my address has been the same for more than 12 years!!!<br /><br />They finally said they would give me a refund 'in a few weeks'. I was furious and insisted on an immediate refund! I ordered the cd from someone else, and it arrived in a couple DAYS! LOVE IT!<br /><br />I ADVISE YOU DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH 'BLOWITOUTAHERE'!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1449575617|4.0|Definitely a page turner, fantastically entertaining with layered plots that keep the reader guessing and presenting turns and suprises.  My favorite character was Count Fosco for his colorful personality, devilish brilliance, and admiration for Marian, and oh! How delicious is his unexpected past and his end!
0439023491|4.0|Exciting pace, as was the case with the first book. It meanders and sets up relationships at first, but then when things happen they happen quickly. I expected this book to delve right into the rebellion...it's obvious the residents of this world are ready to explode. Instead, we go back to the hunger games while the rebellion begins elsewhere. I suppose that fits with the nature of the series...but it would be nice to Katiness play a more direct role but I suppose this is her nature. She is her badass self and inspires others, inadvertently, just by being her. Perhaps in the next book she will get to play a more active role in the takedown of the Capital...rather than playing games while others rally. Enjoy!
0143116177|5.0|As Ferguson points out so clearly in his latest book, \\"Ascent of Money\\", money and its propagation have become the chief driving forces of modern history. Like it or not, society's love affair with money has driven it to devise all kinds of ingenious means for expanding its power to produce more. This study looks at a number of fascinating scenarios where the Medicis, the Rothschilds, the Bank of England, the Paris stock exchange, the insurance industry and Wall Street have all done their bit to raise the historical significance of hard cash to a stratospheric level where it is no longer just a tangible piece of paper but is now a universal abstraction called credit. At the heart of the matter is the individual and corporate need to generate economic growth by creating monetary opportunity. Money only circulates effectively in society if people can trust its value as a medium of exchange for goods and services. If production falters, as it is presently, money can quickly devalue. Ferguson goes well beyond looking at the conventional realms of money as a basic specie to analyzing the inflated world of credit instruments such as bonds, debentures, bills of exchange, stocks, swaps, derivatives, mortgages, and credit cards. While money has expanded to include a variety of uses which have encouraged western civilization to modernize in leaps and bounds, it has come with a terrible price: failure to know when to exercise restraint and moderation in the rush to get rich quickly. It is this excessive behaviour in war, peace, and prosperity that compels many to take incredible risks with their own money and that borrowed from traditional sources like banks. Offsetting every optimistic prospect of making money is the ever-present fear that it could be just as easily lost. We have now reached a point in history where the expected and projected big growth of the past decades is slowly being replaced by a long-term forecast of lower and even negative growth due to our inability to keep ahead of the investment curve. The traditional power and lure of money may no longer be able to sustain our personal and collective drive to make and keep wealth. Ferguson is one of those big picture historians who fills his writing with lots of interesting stories to make his point. Very informative read!to keep ahead of the investment curve.

B002GU605G|5.0|This set was purchased as a gift.  Out of the four discs, the main one was missing even though the set was still factory sealed when it was opened by the recipient.  Has anyone else experienced this problem with this set?  Thank you.
0307454541|5.0|Great book. So much going on throughout the entire story. Was very entertaining and well written. I'm looking forward to the 2nd one!
B0001CNRSE|5.0|I really loved this movie, Jessica alba had a sexy body. I love the plot and just about everything in this movie. It is inspirational. When i watched it made me feel like i wanted some sort of a life like that. It made me feel like i never felt before. I don't care what all the critics say, they just want attention. I even read what they had to say and still watched the movie. One of the best I have ever seen. I recommend you watch this, it is great. One of the best. And hopefully there are more that felt like me and believe what i say may just be true to others.
B003Y5H4SO|1.0|DEVIL is truly frustrating - some first-rate actors, clever direction that makes the most of a claustrophobic setting... but the script is SO lame (with a final \\"Shyamalan\\" twist stolen directly from Agatha Christie's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE), that the movie remains all promise, no delivery.
0316098337|5.0|I finished this book a week ago and I can't stop thinking about it! Very well-written page-turner, it seems Mrs. Donoghue researched the psychological effects of captivity VERY well. Highly recommended read.
B0010ZR160|5.0|After watching this movie once and being shocked at how good the plot, direction, and affleck's little brother is, whom actually out-acts his older brother, this moive was nothing short of a masterpiece. Wonderful twists and turns that you usually don't see. Great accents, cinematography, sub-plots, and everything. This movie is near perfect. So a few days ago, I showed it to my girlfriend, best friend and his wife. I loved watching their facial expressions as the movie went on. I even got goosebumps from a scene the second time around as well that I won't tell you about because I dont want to spoil the movie for you=) anywho, check it out..def something to add to the collection.<br /><br />Casey affleck should stay infront of camera, ben should continue directing, cuz this and the town are absolutely amazing films!<br /><br />-Cam
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Full collection with everything a Beatles fan could possibly want. I bought this for my finace and he LOVED it.  It's much better buying the physical set than buying it off of iTunes.  You have the CDs so you can transport the music anywhere as well as import them into your iTunes. I also bought him the Beatles shirt to go with it.
B003L20IFQ|3.0|Okay, weird movie with interesting concept. The camera never leaves the coffin. Now just after reading that first sentence should tell you whether you would a) even like to see movie now, and b) be able to actually sit for 1hr 30min and watch someone in a coffin. Hey at least its Ryan Reynolds and he brings some sort of life, humor, and reality to the role. If it were someone we are not familiar with, it might have been a lot different review. I for one, will congratulate the director Cortes for capturing every camera angle from that coffin that he could, that was one way to keep my attention. Also just to be clear, I will mention the fact that the snake came in through the whole it left from..okay? Okay. Moving on, just watch the movie yourself and see what you think. The ending is interesting and very intriguing with an a good amount of intensity. Overall, I give it 6 outta 10. I would not watch again, but I will not regret watching movie if you understand.<br /><br />-Cam
0312600844|2.0|After reading and enjoying very much Franzen's \\"The Corrections\\" I was looking forward to \\"Freedom.\\"  The second book had received mostly rave reviews.  As it turns out, I should have read the Amazon reviews first which were a mixed bag with Franzen receiving as many one stars as five.    The problem with this book is that you simply don't care.  I was three quarters of the way through when I realized that I didn't give a fig about any of the characters.  He appears to have written this book about topics that only he himself could possibly care about.  I'll be far more cautious the next time I decide to purchase one of his works.
B000FBJAOG|1.0|I am huge fan of zombies in general.  This book started out to be dryly humorous.  I kept waiting for it to become hilarious.  It did not.  The dry humor continued throughout.  I ended up skimming through the last 1/3 of the book to see if there was something I was missing.  I assure you there was nothing to be missed.  I had high hopes, but this book sadly did not fill the hole in my zombie heart!
B004498KPU|1.0|The main reason I wanted to add this product to my collection was because it was rumored to include MJ's \\"GHOSTS\\" - previously unreleased in any form here in the states.  While \\"Thriller\\" is certainly the deserving landmark piece of work it is, I believe GHOSTS is MJ's modern day masterpiece - the Thriller for the new century.  The make-up by Stan Winston studios, the costumes, dancing, Michael's acting, and killer music and singing - all combine to make this a feast for the eyes for nearly 40 minutes.  All I could previously get my grubby eyes on was a grainy NTSC version converted from PAL.      The fact that SONY would release an edited music video version of this short film is a travesty.  All I can assume is they plan to release this as a stand-alone some future Halloween and make a killing from it here in the U.S.  Whatever.  Then they shouldn't call this his complete short films. I'm not one of those who complains that every last performance like those on the Super Bowl should be here (as if they were his short films).  By that logic, every television performance he ever did would qualify.    However, too much of this set has been previously available on various dvds...and what they did to GHOSTS is unforgivable - plain and simple.  And it is this sole act that has earned this collection 1 star.    Oh...and why the heck was Smooth Criminal edited as well when BAD and THRILLER are complete?  Uggh.
B000024A70|5.0|Queen's first Greatest Hits album came out in November of 1981.<br />This compilation was released worldwide with different tracklistings in some territories and was a proper introduction to Queen's 1973-80 period (mine included when I first had a copy of this on cassette I acquired in December of 1990 with a dub of the US Elektra Records version).<br />This CD version of the 1981 Greatest Hits is its original UK tracklisting featuring classics like \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" which was Queen's biggest US hit which hit #1 in 1980 and is a rock disco classic. Plus Queen's first US Top 10 and first UK #1 in 1975 hit out of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" which reached #9 in the US in 1976 and this classic needs no explanation (would reach #2 in its US re-release in 1992). We also have the band's first US #1 hit from 1980 out of \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" which is a classic rockabilly romp. \\"Killer Queen\\" follows and was the band's first US Top 20 hit in Spring 1975 in the US and hit #2 in 1974 in the UK. Included is the single mix of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" which is a nice different version to the full album track and that was a Top 30 US hit in 1978 as was its A-side \\"Bicycle Race\\".<br />We also have \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\" which both hit #4 in early 1978 here in the US (the tracks are separate but the US record company Elektra Records insisted on playing the two together) and both are classic rally cry/victory cry songs and were #2 in the UK. Also included is the single mix of the song \\"Flash\\" which was the theme to the 1980 film Flash Gordon (did well in UK but not so well Stateside). Also on this is the US Top 20 hit from early 1977/UK Top 5 from 1976 out of \\"Somebody to Love\\" which was a great gospel tinged rocker. The 1976 US Top 20/UK Top 10 hit ballad \\"You're My Best Friend\\" which was the follow up single to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" on A Night at the Opera is here. Plus you have the UK Top 20/US Top 50 hit \\"Play the Game\\" from 1980, great ballad.<br />The other tracks which appear on the UK greatest hits album were the rock radio hit \\"Now I'm Here\\" (a UK Top 20 in 1975), the classic \\"Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy\\" (a UK Top 30 in 1977 but not released as single Stateside, instead it was \\"Long Away\\" that got released and tanked), the classic \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" (a UK hit but stiffed here in the US in 1974), the big UK Top 10 hit \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" (which was well received on US rock radio but flopped on pop singles chart in 1979, Bee Gees and disco ruled the roost on singles in US) and the ballad \\"Save Me\\" (which was a UK Top 20 in 1980 but an album track here in the States as the song was not issued as a single in the US) round out the CD.<br />This CD was first released in the 1980s with dull sound. Then in 1994, Parlophone/EMI re-released with remastered sound which was done at Abbey Road Studios and sounds better than some versions out (the 2001 Japan remaster would be issued in the US in 2004 with even superior sonic quality).<br />RECOMMENDED!s which appear on the UK greatest hits album were the rock radio hit \\"Now I'm Here\\" (a UK Top 20 in 1975), the classic \\"Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy\\" (a UK Top 30 in 1977 but not released as single Stateside, instead it was \\"Long Away\\" that got released and tanked), the classic \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" (a UK hit but stiffed here in the US in 1974), the big UK Top 10 hit \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" (which was well received on US rock radio but flopped on pop singles chart in 1979, Bee Gees and disco ruled the roost on singles in US) and the ballad \\"Save Me\\" (which was a UK Top 20 in 1980 but an album track here in the States as the song was not issued as a single in the US) round out the CD.

B002Q9VPFM|5.0|I have seen the theatrical, director's cut, and the ultimate cut shown here, and the ultimate cut is the only one I want to watch now.  If you want to appreciate Watchmen in the closest form to the book, this is the one to see.  Don't waste your time on anything else -- I mean, compared to the theatrical cut, this is only an extra hour or so.  If you're willing to invest three hours of your time, you may as well invest four.    While the extra features on the other discs aren't that special, in my opinion, the Black Freighter clips interspersed into the live action film really bring this to another level.  Now that the price is way down on this, you can't go wrong buying it!
B00005664Y|5.0|Queen's second greatest hits album entitled Greatest Hits II was originally released in October, 1991 in most of the world except for the US and Canada as Queen were on a different record label for the US and Canada as opposed to the rest of the world where the band was (until 2010) with EMI.<br />By the time of Queen's second compilation, the band (which comprised of lead singer Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, bass player John Deacon and drummer Roger Taylor) were huge through most of the world but sadly had lost their popularity in the US and in Canada due to a few ill-advised detours and videos that drove the fans from the US' \\"Dust Bowl\\" and \\"Bible Belt\\" away. I think it's a real shame because the band released three great albums (1984's The Works, 1989's The Miracle and 1991's superb Innuendo) in that period and two good albums (1982's Hot Space and 1986's A Kind of Magic). Greatest Hits II would be issued in the US and Canada with a modified tracklist as Classic Queen as I'll explain later.<br />Greatest Hits II contains two US Pop Top 40 hits which were \\"Under Pressure\\" (which hit #29 Pop and Top 10 Mainstream Rock in the US in late 1981) and \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" (which hit #16 Pop in the US in 1984) plus \\"The Show Must Go On\\" (which eventually peaked at #2 when released in the US in 1992 as double A-side with \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\"'s re-release). It also has some of the band's huge US rock radio hits out of \\"One Vision\\" (here in its single edit and superior to the album version on A Kind of Magic IMHO) (#20 Billboard Rock Tracks in 1985), \\"I Want it All\\" (here in its single edit) (which hit #3 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1989), \\"Headlong\\" (here slightly edited) (which also hit #3 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1991) and \\"Innuendo\\" (which hit #17 on the same Billboard Rock Tracks chart in the spring of 1991).<br />Also here are songs that were big hits in the UK/Europe but sadly tanked here in the US which were the classics \\"A Kind of Magic\\", \\"Breakthru\\", \\"It's a Hard Life\\", \\"I Want to Break Free\\" (featured in its superior single mix) and \\"Hammer to Fall\\" (also here in its single mix). Also included here are songs that were released as singles in Europe but not ever released as singles here in the US but are great album tracks to us Yanks which were \\"The Miracle\\", \\"The Invisible Man\\", \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\", \\"Friends Will Be Friends\\" and \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" (if that song doesn't move you then you have no soul).<br />Greatest Hits II would be released in the US as Classic Queen in March of 1992 with a modified tracklisting. Then the album would see US release on the 1995 Gold Collection and the 2002 Platinum Collection with a 2001 Japanese remaster. Then in 2011, Universal re-released it with a remaster and Hollywood Records (for the US and Canada) released as a standalone in April, 2011.<br />RECOMMENDED!\\"A Kind of Magic\\", \\"Breakthru\\", \\"It's a Hard Life\\", \\"I Want to Break Free\\" (featured in its superior single mix) and \\"Hammer to Fall\\" (also here in its single mix).

068484267X|5.0|How do you tell a tale of a poverty-stricken upbringing with humor and grace?  Frank McCourt does it in his memoir in a way that will keep you turning pages long after the last time you said to yourself, \\"I really must put this book down and get ... done.\\"<br /><br />After the tragic loss of his 7-week-old sister Margaret, Frank's family (dad, mom, 3-year-old brother Malachy and 1-year-old twins Oliver and Eugene) moves back to Ireland when Frank is four.  They are promptly turned away from their paternal grandparents' house and sent to Dublin, where they are told that Frank's father should be able to get some compensation for having fought for Ireland's cause.  This turns out to be untrue, and, penniless, they end up at the police station, where only the kindness of the officers gives them the money they need to continue to their maternal grandmother's home.<br /><br />Frank's father is a drunkard from Northern Ireland who can't keep a job longer than the third paycheck, and even the dole money he is given when out of work winds up going to drink rather than to feeding his family.  They live with fleas, in a unit that floods on the lower level, forcing them to spend much of their time upstairs.<br /><br />The reader finds out about the peculiar prejudice of the southern Irish against those of the North, easily distinguishable by their accents, and also about the injustice bred by poverty.  We see Frank and his family going hungry while other families eat, and Frank wishing that someone else could be his mother simply because then he could always have mashed potatoes or soup.  Siblings sicken and die, and his mother is shamefully reduced to begging for scraps to feed her children.  Other fathers go to England to work, as does Frank's father, but, unlike the other fathers, no money is sent to his family.  In spite of Frank's intelligence and the recommendation of his schoolmaster, Frank is turned away as an altar boy due to his poverty, and other doors are closed to him as well.<br /><br />In spite of it all, there is hope and laughter in this novel.  There are people we want to punch, and people we want to hug.  There is the small joy of having enough to buy a piece of candy or go to the movie, and the larger joy of sometimes having a full meal or a couple of coins in your pocket.<br /><br />This is a tug-at-your-heart, in your face look at a hardscrabble life that many of us couldn't imagine, written by someone who falls in love with the words of Shakespeare and with Wodehouse novels while recovering from typhoid fever in the hospital.  It is a tale that all readers will love, and I highly recommend it for anyone's shelves.<br /><br />QUOTES<br /><br />She says that if Dad's job lasts we'll get proper cups and maybe saucers and some day, with the help of God and His Blessed Mother, we'll have sheets on the bed and if we save a long time a blanket or two instead of those old coats which people must have left behind during the Great Famine.<br /><br />That dog is a right Hindu, so she is, and that's where I found her mother wandering around Bangalore.  If ever you're getting a dog, Francis, make sure it's a Buddhist.  Good-natured dogs, the Buddhists.  Never, never get a Mahommedan.  They'll eat you sleeping.  Never a Catholic dog.

1423113381|4.0|Up front the only reason I gave this selection a 4 was that my kids didn't find it as humorous as the Percy Jackson and the Olympiad series.  That said I really enjoyed it.  I like that the modern day family dynamics come into play but there are great explanations to who does what when and where :)  and of course all the whys.  This reads like a good childrens mystery and I look forward to seeing the rest of this series when they comes out.  Great Job Rick!  Hope you keep writing up a storm! ( inside joke to those who have read it)  we're looking forward to enjoying what you write for years to come.  Please don't keep us waiting too long.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series ,I've watched it several times and do not tire of it. the idiots who canceled the series should be flogged.  This is star wars meets western. I really like westerns and enjoy some sci fi.
142311339X|5.0|Hurray! I was thrilled to read the first volume in this Rick Riordan Heroes of Olympus series.   My children much preferred this to the Red Pyramid series.  They explained that it was just more fun and similar to the Percy Jackson series in the writing style and humor.  I was not disappointed in the way it ended and think it's a nice bridge into whatever Rick has waiting us.  It's fun to see my kids making connections when they see things about gods and goddesses and mythology both in their schooling and on TV or on videos.  Good clean enjoyable read.

B003L45JLW|5.0|This was originally a reply to another review of the blu-ray audio version of the latest Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album.  But I figured I may as well write my own review.  The album itself is very good.  Maybe the best TP album out of the last several.  But this is more a review of the blu-ray audio disc itself.  Just got it in today, as well as a new subwoofer (great timing!). All I can say is...WOW!!! Hooked up my new sub for my first 5.1 setup in my main TV room (I have had 5.0 for many years but just now adding a sub) and this was the first thing I played. The 5.1 mix sounds glorious on my setup: Yamaha receiver, JBL fronts, Infinity center and surrounds, and my new 10 inch sub. This disc sounds simply fantastic. Crystal clear even cranked way up. Great use of the surround speakers with some background vocals, guitar sounds coming from specific left or right front speakers.  All of it mixing together to produce an outstanding audio experience.  I hope more artists begin to put out blu-ray audio discs. But I am afraid it probably will not catch on. Truly a shame because this is a fantastic way to listen to an album. Not that many people do that anymore. Which is another true shame. Oh well, at least I can enjoy this incredible Tom Petty blu-ray audio disc.<br /><br />If you have a blu-ray player and even a decent surround sound system you have to get this version of this album.  Yeah it cost a little more but believe me it is well worth it.  You can come back here and thank me later!

B003VANOFY|5.0|As with most others have said Sound Quality is really good, above what i expected, i have had at-least 5 other sets and disliked them all. Even though say the sennheiser sounded great the lack of surround emulation and less comfortable fit not to mention corded did the product in, although it has been a couple of years since i have purchased any headphones because of my bad experiences over the years. But to me a must in this day is  wireless, a product without it is not worth using IMO, I use my pc not just for games but as a HTPC so if i cannot get up and move around that is a no go and has been the worst problem with my other sets.   I am rather impressed with the 7.1 so far in games i can tell directions,  if your a gamer that is a min. but not nearly as good as my 7.1 onkyo and separates of course but well enough not to take a whippin.    Now the not so good, in games like L4D2 as the action get's intense the distortion is so bad you have no idea what is going on if you have you graphic EQ set with what i like for normal music and such but i have a g-key set to switch back to the basic slider bass/treble with the bass set about -2db and treble up and that games sounds fine like that, with that said alot of other games have no problems with the bass up i do not know why L4D2 is so bad, a small problem i would say     The g-keys could be more useful i have added an plug-in so I can play/pause etc. virtually all players i have on my computer but the built in options are limited, i have not used it enough to say for sure but it looks like you cannot do alot i have one for play and one to switch EQ. but who cares anyway keyboards do a better job of that anyway.    Battery life is 8+ hours i have not timed it to the minute but i have gone over 8 even then i shut it down it did not auto shutoff.    Voice morphing, well the first few minutes is like wow then OK shut that off at-least for me. But as far as i can tell the noise cancellation does not work on regular voice just morphing.      For the money these are a must buy in this class yes i have bought some with better sound but the total package these deliver far exceeds my others.

This book is fantastic as well as the other 4 in the series and would suggest to anyone to read them all.  I liked how the Kelt's have been weaved into the stories after reading several of her Highlander books in leiu of waiting on this release.    I'll miss my nightcap with Barrons  tomorrow night.  Loved his character and K'Vruck's.   Looking toward many more adventures Ms. Moning!      Debi L-H  @ Roswell, GA
B0034G4P7Q|2.0|i was excited to see this film based on all the buzzzzzzzzzzzz about it. I have to say I found the whole thing disturbing. Greed, greed and more greed. I was not riveted by the mush of whiny people whining about how they deserve more of the bucks than the other. I  would even go on to say i do not even want to use facebook anymore  after seeing this flick
1594202842|4.0|I picked up this book at Borders since I heard alot of stuff online and in the news.  Well, the bookstore had only 1 left when it came out that week.  Now, alot of people will either love it or hate it as you can see with the Amazon rating bars above.  Well, I would have to say that I liked it but not in love with it.  I guess the main things you may be asking yourself is (a) is this an accurate portrayal of parents who are pushers? (b) how do kids cope with parents who are pushers? and (c) what's the damage later down the road into adulthood?<br /><br />First, Amy Chua nailed it in terms of parents who are big pushers.  I just think she went a little overboard with the violin and piano practicing.  My mom dragged me to the piano and violin kicking and screaming.  But, she lived with just 30 minutes to 1 hour of practicing a day.  I really appreciate this since now I can enjoy playing with a community orchestra.  Other things that Chua mentions about child growing these days are pretty accurate.  Parents need to be in the know about things in general.  Helicopter parenting sounds horrible but in these days, you pretty much need to keep a look out for things.  I grew up in the days of dail-in modems where there was limited stuff online.  Now, technology wins and you got other things to worry about- Facebook, etc.  Another common theme is drilling kids at an early age.  Drilling seems to run rampant with Chua and my parents.  However, I think creativity is lacking which needs to be addressed.  I really loved the moment during an interview when a teacher acknowledge Lulu's unique way of arranging numbers.  Although it gets ingrained in our brains, the actual knowledge does not set it.  I think Chua gets it wrong when she says \\"only when you are good at it, the it is fun\\".  My Physics prof at Penn got it right when he explained it to me.  At the time, I thought he was crazy when I heard it.  \\"Phil, I usually find with students like yourself do better when you forget about grades.  Once you really understand it, the grade will come...\\"  The danger of drilling is retention.<br /><br />Second, I think Chua means well in pushing her kids, but there are limits.  The scene in Russia is a perfect example with her second daughter, Lulu.  I think both my sister and I had our moment of \\"enough is enough\\".  Chua takes it to the next level with ridiculous violin and piano practicing on vacations around the world.  You realize that Chua is living her life through her kids which is a bit unfair.  I was so relieved that Chua realized this and backed down.  The reason why I liked this book is she gives a pretty honest portrayal.  We are all human and we learn hopefully from our mistakes.  However, why did it take years and years of realization to do this?  The other thing that I have to mention is the negative reinforcement.  I read some reviews and heard interviews of Chua and her kids.  It sounds like Chua is proud of her kids which is good so I don't believe she is overdoing the negative reinforcement with \\"garbage\\", etc.  For me, I had wished my parents read this book before putting me through a rollercoaster of seeking approval.  But, I can't blame them for doing it.  It is a dog-eat-dog world out there.  Moments from Chua's childhood like tied for first place and her father's disapproval were all too real for me.  I remembered being extremely upset at myself in the final round of Mathcounts when I froze on stage.  I brought home a 5th Place trophy and then in the car, my Dad told me that I had embarrassed him in front of his colleagues.<br /><br />Third, my Chinese teacher recently asked me how I thought her kids will turned out.  At the time, I mentioned they probably will be okay.  But really, it's hard to tell...  Kids have rebelled and my parents have told me horror stories.  After high school, the kids are on their own and hopefully doing what they want to do.  My sister asked me over the phone about why I let Mom and Dad talk me intomajoring in Chemical Engineering.  I mentioned that they wanted us to be employed once we graduated.  I was pretty good at violin and piano and enjoyed watching films- foreign and independent.  But, I could do this sort of stuff in my free time.  My strengths were in math and science and I sorta liked chemistry in high school.  Life is short and no need to drag up the past, right?  Well, I got reminded of it with Chua's book but overall, it was good to hear it from someone else.ineering.  I mentioned that they wanted us to be employed once we graduated.

B00007KWHN|5.0|THE YES ALBUM (1971) is my second favorite \\"yes album\\", behind the immortal CLOSE TO THE EDGE. I absolutely love this album, in that it has great lyrics, great jazz beats, unique vocals, and that signature carnival-sounding guitar sound that was invented by Peter Banks on their first album, YES, from 1969. Banks demonstrated the prog guitar sound in the song, I See You, and that was the groundwork for their definitive sound. Yes, I will give credit where credit is due. Steve Howe is one hell of a guitarist, and carried on that sound, all the while mixing in his own inventions as well. Tony Kaye is superb on piano and keyboards, as well. Every song on this masterpiece is stellar, and my favorites are YOURS IS NO DISGRACE, STARSHIP TROOPER, A VENTURE, and PERPETUAL CHANGE. The latter starts like a news theme (the first 15 seconds of the song). At least that's what it reminds ME of. This was definitely Yes' breakthrough album, and to think that they got even better is really something. Here are my top five Yes albums: 1. CLOSE TO THE EDGE 2. THE YES ALBUM 3. FRAGILE 4.YES 5. RELAYER. My runner-up album is TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS....

B001DDCVCI|3.0|I have been a fan of Johnny Cash for many years.  I saw him in person several times and I  had the pleasure of meeting him and June Carter after a concert in Chico, California.  That was a couple of years after the famous Folsom Prison concert.  Of course I bought that live recording right after the album came out. That is why I was so disappointed after receiving this latest package. After all these years you can not imagine how much I was looking forward to seeing footage of that famous concert. There was zero.  None. Nada. What you get instead is a mix of still photos along with many interviews with people who were there or who knew John. [ That is what June called him]. Some of it is informative and entertaining but some is boring and cartoonish.  Included with the so-so DVD are two nearly identical cd's.  Show #1 and Show #2.  You will hear everything from the original album plus some extra material.  It is nice to hear Carl Perkins and the Statler Bros. doing their thing. There were no opening acts on the original vinyl.  A few Of the songs on the cd's are really bad and I can see why they were left off the original album.  \\"I Got a Woman\\" with June comes to mind.  Everything concidered I still recommend this package. Johnny is and always  will be one of my favorites. My personal recommedation from Amazon for Johnny Cash fans:  Johnny Cash Live from Denmark 1971. Not long enough but outstanding! Carl, Carter Family, Statlers.  Wow!  Also: The 2 disc \\"Best of Johnny Cash T.V. Show '69-71\\" is great!  Many fantastic guests!
0393327345|2.0|The first rule about Fight Club should be a disclaimer that you will lose 4 or 5 hours of your life that you'll never get back. There were two redeeming qualities to the audio book: 1) it was just over 5 hours long, and 2)the narrarator wasn't terrible. Outside of that, there is little to be excited about here. The characters are almost as unbelievable as the preposterous, meandering plotline of this jumbled mess. All the tricks of the trade are here: allegory, alliteration, emphatic repetition. None of it works. It rings as hollow as an undergrad emulating his favorite author, and falling woefully short. An unnecessary \\"revelation\\" 3/4 of the way through the book does little to help anything other than the further cheapening of the struggling material. This is my second go round with a Palahniuk book (Choke was the first and disturbingly similar), and doubtfully my last. There are too many good reads out there to waste one of the finite ones you have left on this drivel.
B0017YZI7S|5.0|By far the best Rolling Stones concert footage I have ever seen.  The boys look great, well dressed except for Charlie maybe.  The DVD on Blu-ray is outstanding.  The song list is excellent compared to some other live shows.  Also, the Bonus Material is very entertaining. Highly recommended from a fan who has seen the Stones many times over the years. This disc is well worth the money!  The Stones sound wonderful and you can tell they are having a great time.  Especially Keith! It is obvious he loves his job.  I also bought \\"Shine a Light\\" from Amazon.  Also worth purchasing.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|To begin, I rated this movie five stars not because its one of the best movies I've ever seen, but because, in my opinion, its better than so many of the movies released in 2010.<br /><br />Compared to the other oldie action movie of 2010, The Expendables, RED is a clear winner.<br />As others have said; we know, and probably mostly love, the cast. Being British, the delightful performances of Helen Mirren and Brian Cox were going to make this a winner for me, and Karl Urban always impresses me.<br /><br />Philip French in The Guardian (a British newspaper) reviewed RED and said 'This is painting by numbers for people who have trouble with mental arithmetic.'  No doubt if, like Mr French, you only enjoy watching obscure Kenyan arthouse movies then RED isn't for you.<br /><br />There's a measured amount of comedy, a great fight scene between Willis and Urban, and will probably be remembered for Helen Mirren in a white ballgown firing the belt fed machine gun.<br /><br />The DVD release is decent, but I wish they'd put a little effort into making some limited editions for us collectors.<br /><br />I wish Amazon would keep reviews of the blu-ray release seperate from DVD reviews, although those of us buying DVDs can laugh this time around as the blu-ray buying fools pay almost double for a movie only release with mere DVD quality sound (those 1 star reviews).
0385341679|3.0|I am a big fan of this series. However this \\"final\\" book left me with more unanswered questions than answered ones.  Parts of the story were as concise, compelling and spell-binding as the previous four books. But too many parts of Shadowfever left me saying- what? Who? Why on earth would that be? There were multiple contradictions throughout. There were sections that fitted smoothly together, moving from one plot line to another. Then suddenly there would be something that felt contrived-  there because nothing else was available to make the story work.   This book also was not formatted like the other four which was dissappointing as things I had looked forward to seeing (Mac's updated glossary, for example) were missing. While there were plenty of plot twists and turns, there were also a few too many dragging spots, too many Mac emotional crisis episodes and the whole thing felt disjointed.  This is a wonderful series and the world KMM creates is very intricate and compelling. I think though that this final book could have been shorted and more precise- the editor needed the butterfly fingers of an accomplished surgeon wielding a titanium scalpel not a butter knife to make this a perfect end to a wild ride.
B003ZWTGKU|5.0|Due to the extremely passionate and beautiful singing of its two leads (Jonas Kaufmann and Sophie Koch), I felt, at times, this DVD OF Massenet's most intense, sad and beautiful opera Werther just might melt my DVD player.    To my surprise, there was no \\"melt down\\".  However, at the end of the performance on this DVD, I truly felt that I had just witnessed a great moment in opera.     Good Heavens, I really enjoyed this 2-disc Decca DVD from the Opera de national de Paris that is splendidly lead by Michel Plasson who manages to keep this January 2010 performance all well under control conducting with much sensitivity and grace eliciting overwhelming performances  from all.  Being an old fart, I have tended to think that all of the so-called great performances and opera performers were in the past and that opera's \\"Golden Age\\" is long past.  If this new taped performance of Werther does not one day be considered \\"Golden\\", I will be very surprised.       Jonas Kaufmann is simply staggering as the romantic, melancholy, would be stalker and very sad hero Werther.    In this performance, Kaufmann has it all--a wonderfully controlled voice that is able to effortlessly produce beautiful messa-voce passages along with stirring high notes.  A voice that has heft and body sounding kind of baritonal until he soars into the stratosphere; he also is a fantastic and moving actor along with  processing matinee-idol looks. All that I can say to his performance on this DVD is BRAVO.  I was simply overwhelmed with his glorious singing of the opera's \\"big\\" aria Pourquoi Me Reveiller.  (I was in tears yelling bravo at its end.)    Sophie Koch, as Charlotte is also very outstanding going from a rather innocent young girl to a very strong woman.  Koch has a strong mezzo-soprano voice that is well able to be very dramatic and soar to the heights.  Her \\"big\\" scenes and arias are very thrilling. She is a very moving Charlotte pouring out wonderful sounds and passion.       I also loved the(what I call) the minimalistic staging--a rather sparse stage that allowed the singers to demonstrate their acting abilities. I also enjoyed the controversial peep at the singers before they were to go on stage and sing--it was as if I were \\"a fly on the wall \\"witnessing what happens back stage.      It has been a very long time since I have enjoyed an operatic performance as I have enjoyed this Decca DVD of Massenet's Werther.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|I just saw this movie on Comcast Ondemand and I gotta say it was a blast Bruce Willis,and Morgan freeman and John Malkovich as Ex Cia in retirement who wined up on a hit list and that is where the fun begins through the list and turns you will have a ball and as for Helen Mirren what can I say except she is still a babe,she takes to this movie certain Jenesaisquois, all I know is they all still have all, this movie is worth the money if nothing else for Helen Mirren for she is one fine looking women....................
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I don't even know where to begin this review without giving too much away. I waited eagerly (and impatiently) for Shadowfever after finishing Dreamfever and dying to know who the beast was, although I had a fairly good inkling. I am usually very skeptical and wary when venturing into \\"the last book\\" of a series, always fearing that the book will undo everything I experienced in the books before it and will make me feel like I've wasted my time. A bad end, can ruin everything that set before it, but I am glad to say, ShadowFever DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!! I don't remember when I was this engrossed in book! The adventure, the questions, and finally the answers I've been searching for wrapped up in a neat package for me to rip apart! Karen Marie Moning does an amazing job weaving this story and finalizing an ending that does the series justice.    From beginning to end, I was on an emotional roller coaster with this. The beginning had me excited (to finally know who the beast was) and devastated when I found out! I breezed through the first few pages itchy to finally uncover the truth. And Mac, poor Mac dove off the deep end with the discovery herself. It took a traumatic act to make her discover herself. It was heart wrenching and enlightening. I don't think Mac would be the official \\"Mac 5.0\\" if she hadn't experienced it. The death helped shape her into a more final version of herself. Had she not experienced it, she would be more like a Mac 4.6 or something, almost there, almost who she needed to be, but still unable to reach her goal.     Trying to be as vague as possible (it's so easy to give too much away!), the characters finally grow into their own and stay true to themselves. Mac is tested over and over and where Mac 1.0 would have given up, Mac 5.0 travels on. I have never been a true fan of Mac, she kind of worked my nerve with some of her bad decisions and the perky \\"rainbow girl\\" persona she embraced. She always seemed a bit weak for the road ahead of her. Butafter DreamFever and finally in ShadowFever, she grows stronger and to me, more relate-able. I used to feel very disconnected from Mac, and while I still do on some levels, she is more We finally learn more about the Lord Master and his relationship with Alina, we learn what Mac is and what she was meant for, we understand more about Barrons and what he is after (altho who he is is a still a bit of a mystery), the mystery around Mac's \\"real\\" parents are touched upon, mystery of the Unseelie king, his concubine and the Seelie Queen are addressed, there is just so much in this book! If anything the only question left unanswered is what Barrons and his entourage are but honestly, like Mac, I can accept that. I would like to know what he is, but I can understand why it can't be disclosed. And with a deeper understanding of what he's after and why, I think I know enough... for now.    I think the thing that really got me most in this book were the unpredictable twists. I was reading the last few chapters at work on my computer and the twist at the very end of chapter 51 had me so shocked my mouth dropped open and my eyes crossed! I was NOT expecting that and I loved it! I can't say more, or I would have said too much, you'll just have to read it for yourself. There are a few more twists, some unexpected betrayals, some surprise encounters and even more stunning discoveries.    I also loved encountering more of the Keltar clan from KMM's Highlander series in this book. It felt like I bumped into old friends again! Dageaus, Drustan, and Cian Keltar all make appearances and so does Adam Black (all put smiles on my face when they \\"walk\\" onto the pages!)    With all the answers in this book, there are however more questions! Which leaves plenty of room for some interesting spinoffs. The questions posed aren't the type that drive you crazy, nor are the cliffhangers that KMM is known for. They are more like openings for more story centering around different characters. Christian Keltar,Ryodan and Dani have so much ahead of them in the Fever world and I really hope I get to read more about them!    Mystery, fantasy, darkness, magic and suspense reign supreme in this stunning finale to an amazing series! Shock after shock, answers to your questions, character growth and a fitting and satisfying conclusion make this book a must!

030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferriss has become the Oprah of Silicon Valley. He's turned living life to its fullest (and documenting said life in exhaustive detail) into his own brand, packaged for sale to millions of geeky followers. And like Oprah, a lot of what he says should elicit a \\"WTF?\\" But it doesn't matter. The dude's an icon.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Body is a haphazard assortment of anecdotes and science-y factoids. You know what they say about a little knowledge? So does Princeton-educated, data-obsessed Tim Ferriss, who himself writes of the book: \\"I believe the how-to is 100% reliable, but some of the why-to will end up on the chopping block as we learn more.\\" In other words, a lot of the science behind the book is junk. But then, what diet book doesn't suffer that flaw? The universal obsession with calories, as Ferriss reminds us, is absurd. Will you lose weight if you cut calories and increase exercise? Not necessarily. Nutrition experts know that, but they don't seem to think their audience is smart enough to understand anything more nuanced than addition and subtraction.<br /><br />Ferriss recommends treating the book as a buffet, picking only the chapters that interest you. Reading the whole thing from cover to cover would be as confusing as hell (\\"Do not drink milk\\" says one chapter; \\"Need something to flavor your coffee? If you must, use cream (not milk), but no more than two tablespoons\\" clarifies another; \\"Add in one liter of 2% organic milk between meals, up to four liters per day\\" suggests a third; \\"Using dairy multiple times per day can create big problems\\" warns a fourth.) The genius of the book is that it encourages you to experiment. Try things, see what works for you. And that's invigorating. Most people (myself included) take a vague approach to health: eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly. We don't think of our bodies as machines to engineer on a day-to-day basis. Professional body-builders may think that way, but should the rest of us? Ferriss says yes: \\"'I just want to be healthy' is not actionable. 'I want to increase my HDL cholesterol and improve my time for a one-mile jog\\" is actionable.\\"<br /><br />Flip to any random page, and you'll get a suggestion for something to try: a glucometer; 2-3 cups of spinach per day; polyphasic sleep; kombucha; garlic, green tea, and alpha lipoic acid supplements; a plant-based diet; missionary position with a buckwheat pillow under the woman. The experience is riveting. Even if you acted on none of these suggestions, there's a fantastic feeling of empowerment underlying them, the notion that you have more control over your body and your life than you'd ever imagined.<br /><br />And that's where I am right now: 3 days after starting the book, I feel awesome. I have no idea whether the prescribed workout, diet or supplement regimen will work for me. In a way, it doesn't matter. Ferriss' infectious can-do, seize-the-day attitude alone makes this book a must-read.healthy' is not actionable.

0385341679|5.0|This is such a great ending to an amazing series.  Yes, it's a long series.  No, not everything is neatly tied in a bow at the end.  So what?  I am hoping that some of the characters from this book get their own books.  Karen Marie Moning created a world filled with characters I would like to know more about.  At the end of the day, isn't that the definition of good writing?
B002RKRTGO|1.0|Note: this is a review is specific for the [[ASIN:B002RKRTGO The Hound of the Baskervilles]] edition and not the book as a whole.  The free kindle edition is missing any passage that would be considered source material in the book.  If the character reads from a document, a newspaper, etc... it's just gone.  Very disappointing. Don't bother with this version.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Very great show with talented actors including Bryan Cranston(Walter White) who won an emmy award for Breaking Bad. I would definitely recommend getting this dvd set. I only have one small complaint which is that I wish all of it could fit on one disc instead of three since it's only 7 episodes but I guess its not their fault because dvd can't fit all of it like blu-ray can. This season starts off a little slow but it gets much better as it progresses into the second season. Very good action and even some funny moments. This set even contains deleted scenes, making of, and commentaries for the pilot episode as well. Can't wait until July which is when the next season starts!<br />-Just an extra note. The dvd does not come with English subtitles for some reason which is kind of weird but it does have French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles.
0385341679|5.0|I didn't think KMM could do it!  I was actually angry at the end of book 3 because of the cliff-hanger....and the enormous amount of questions I'd had since book 1 that were not answered.  It took so long for this book to be released...I gathered together all the previous 4 so that the questions I'd had would be fresh in my mind and then read them one after another.  Amazing!  Wonderful!  Stupendous!  KMM pulled it off!  This has to be the very best book I've read in a couple of years!  I was so glad to see Adam Black make a cameo and so very VERY glad that (as promised) all 5 of the Druids played a role.  Even her never-to-be-republished short story can tie in with Shadowfever.     Thank you KMM for this great series!  Now hurry up and right the next one!!!!!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This is my 2nd Seiko 5 series watch and I love it as much as my first.  The movement is cool and the styling is timeless.  Since it is a self winding watch the time keeping is not atomic clock accurate but as long as you wear it or shake it every day it is more than adequate.  I think the 5 series watches look far better than most other watches on the market, even ones at far higher prices.
0385341679|5.0|Loved the end to this story!  I loved the story!  She does such a good job creating characters and making them flawed.  Love this book will read the series again and again!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Used this video to reinforce historical information on the slave trade and Wilberforce. Students loved it. Highly reccommend it for any teacher who is teaching on slavery or slave trade. Contrary to the title, this video is not filled with religion but conviction. Use it! You'll be glad you did.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|...and had Mr. Fox merely done so, he would have avoided all of the problems that follow him and his family deep into the ground he worked so hard to rise above by writing a column for a newspaper that he constantly wonders if anyone actually reads.  Writing a newspaper is simply not in Mr. Fox's true nature.  He does possess one skill very much in his nature, but he has promised his wife to never steal chickens, geese, turkeys, or squab (whatever they are) ever again.  Had Mr. Fox simply listened to his lawyer, voiced by none other than Bill Murray, then he would have avoided a number of irresistible temptations to his animal nature.  Unfortunately for his family, Mr. Fox cannot stand the undignified feeling of living in a hole...<br /><br />Such are the idiosynchracies of writing a summary of almost anything Wes Anderson writes and directs.  His unique approach to developing characters and putting witty and nuanced dialogue in their mouths often overwhelms a plot as simple and straight-forward as this, but these are exactly the strengths in which fans of Wes Anderson revel.  And his smartly quirky take on family dynamics is alive and well here just as it was [[ASIN:B0000640VJ The Royal Tenenbaums]], [[ASIN:B00005JNLQ The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]], and [[ASIN:B003KGBIS4 The Darjeeling Limited]].  I genuinely believe that with \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" Wes Anderson elevates the family film genre with a story that distinctly character-driven.<br /><br />It would be criminal to overlook all the attention to detail invested in the design, crafting, movement, and even the wardrobe of the physical puppets.  Like many, I have grown increasingly weary of computer-generated images and animation.  That was the main reason [[ASIN:B0007Y08IS Team America: World Police]] was so refreshing to see; real and tangible objects responding to natural lighting.  Such is the appeal here.<br /><br />Wes Anderson's films tend to appeal to those, like myself, who really want to see something different.  Those looking for action and excitement crammed into a film like a can of sardines will probably not appreciate a Wes Anderson outing.  But if you like subtlety, nuance, and humor that is character-driven rather than dueling one-liners one can get in any television sit-com, then I can whole-heartedly recommend this and any of this filmmaker's work.oking for action and excitement crammed into a film like a can of sardines will probably not appreciate a Wes Anderson outing.

B003W5C0VW|5.0|Worth every penny. This show from 1972 has the Stones in Texas putting on one the best shows of their careers. With Mick Taylor on second guitar and much of their setlist pulled the Sticky Fingers era. A must have.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I loved Shadowfever!!! It had so many twists and turns you never could guess what would happen next.  Starting with Darkfever which introduced you to this crazy paranormal world. Every book drew you deeper and deeper into Makayla's self discovery.  I loved how Shadowfever pulled everything together and kept you guessing what would happen next.  Love, Love, Loved it!!
B0041T4ML4|2.0|This book could have been amazing, but instead is simply a snapshot of a bleak and all-too-possible future. Not even rising to the point of parable about our current path, it lacks depth of insight and character development. That being said, it's not a bad read, just unsatisfying.
0743496736|4.0|As a longtime fan of Jodi Picoult books, I was anxious to start reading 19 Minutes. The book is about a girl named Josie who was friends with a boy named Peter. Peter was bullied his whole life and he had always had Josie to protect him; but naturally as the years progressed they stopped being friends and became strangers. As Peter aged the bullying got worse, to the point where couldn't take it anymore, and that's when he started the school shooting which is where the book starts off.     This book is an eye opener to those who normally look away when someone has been bullied or bullies others as well. Everybody has been bullied at least once in thier life, to say otherwise is just being hypocrytical. I never want something like what happened at Sterling High to ever happen at my school, which is why I try to be nice to everybody I come in contact with and stick up for those who get bullied.     The characters in this book are your typical popular preppy girls, dumb jocks, and the bullied nerds. So there really isn't any real character variation; but what it lacks for in character depth, it makes up for in the plot! The plot is so twisted in a way that you'll never know what's going to happen until the very end. It was a \\"Say what?!?!\\" kind of ending.     I really enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend this book to anyone above the age of 15 due to some sexual situations and course language. Other than that though, another really excellent book by Ms. Picoult!
B004G6009K|5.0|I took my 3 1/2 year old son to the theater to see this movie the first week it came out and I wasn't expecting anything great, or that we would even make it through the whole movie.  Boy, was I wrong!  We actually went back 2 weeks later to see it again, and I have pre-ordered it on Amazon for it's April 2011 release as I think it is well worth spending the money on to add to our collection.      At first glance, I thought this movie was based mainly for girls, which at my sons age I don't mind because he really just likes the colors, songs, and funny side plots that happen through your typical Disney movie.  He enjoyed this one so much(much more than Princess and the Frog) and I felt after watching the film that it had a little something for everyone: lots of action, beautiful animation and colors, a really great take on the Rapunzel plot, plenty of laughs, and did I mention the songs?  The songs were wonderful!!!  I can't remeber a recently made Disney movie where I enjoyed the music so much.  Parents, you will definitely appreciate the humor in this movie.  There is a horse named \\"Maximus\\" in it and he will steal every scene he is in - he was in parts that I was crying I was laughing so hard.    The three main characters: Rapunzel, Flynn Rider, and Rapunzel's mother, are very well fleshed out, and the side characters (wait until the scene at the tavern they stop into - there is definitely a cast of characters there).  If you have kids, do yourself a favor and get this movie when it comes out on DVD for your next family movie night.  You will be pleasantly surprised and definitely entertained.
B00005R8FI|5.0|Recently I rediscovered this CD, after attending the concert at the Fillmore East, some 40 plus years ago.  If you are listening to this and your feet aren't moving, then, you're dead! Great music!
B0036OS3ME|5.0|I have very wide feet and thicker calves, so I was worried these might not fit.  I wear anything from a 7 to an 8.5 depending on the style and width of a shoe (I normally net out at a 7.5 wide).  I bought a size 8 in these boots and they fit great!  I was worried that they might be too stiff at the front part of the boot or too tight around my calves, but not only are they roomy around my feet, the top of the boot is wide enough for me to tuck my jeans inside!  I wore them the last time I was up in Rochester, NY and despite the snow, my feet (and jeans!) were warm and dry.  If you wear a half size, I would definitely recommend going up to the next whole size.  I don't usually wear thick socks, so that might effect the fit, but these kept my feet very warm with my regular socks, so thick socks aren't necessary.  Overall, these are inexpensive, warm, comfortable boots that fit great!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|If you are familiar with Daria, you need no review, and have already decided to purchase this set. If you are not familiar with Daria, either 1. you missed it somehow, or 2. you are too young to remember it. In that case, let me tell you: Daria is a show about a highschool girl who is too smart. She is so smart that she doesn't make friends easily, and tends to be sarcastic a lot. While the pace is low-key, the show is very funny, not only because of Daria's subtle mockery, but because of the supporting cast as well, all of whom have strong and entertaining personalities. In addition to all of this, the show is surprisingly deep, questioning not only social norms, but delving into moral dilemmas as well. While the animation is understated, (this show would probably be done in Flash today,) I cannot recommend Daria highly enough. At the most, it will make you a more thoughtful person; at the least, it will make you laugh.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I bought this several months ago and absolutely love it!  It's so great to be driving and not have to worry about cords getting in the way.  It keeps charged for almost a week and I use it several hours a day.  It's so easy to use and charges in about an hour in the car.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Lucas shows great disdain for all the hardworking, creative people who made his original trilogy possible when he plasters over their efforts with his shoddy CGI.  Film historians work their hearts out, trying to restore classic films that have deteriorated over the years, and what does Lucas do?  He sprays graffiti all over his own work.  Very sad.  A slap in the face to fans and creative people alike.  Bring back the originals, Lucas!  Do the right thing!
B000UJ48XG|5.0|Since I discovered Beirut I immediately become a fan. The crooner voice of Zach Condon, the melodic lines of brass instruments, their trueness of sound made by acoustic instruments sets an entire different approach in a world dominated by electronic and post-production, auto-tuned songs.   The whole  album is a kind of ear caress, which explores simple harmony and delicate lyrics with beautiful strings and brass arrangements making an old new sound. I call it an old new sound, because The Flying Club Cup sounds at the same time those old tunes our grandparents used to hear in a square or ballroom, but also sounds new as the strong vocals of Condon sets an alternative to the current mainstream music. With Beirut, we can say that melody is back to music, and is back to stay.  The album gathers influence from East European, French, Gipsy and Mexican songs, making an unique combination inspiring the listener to hear from beginning to end. Of course there are top songs, that may become one's favorite, but listening with attention, there is no bad songs at all.  People who likes Folk Music, Alternative Pop & Rock, or even Tradtional Music, should hear this album with attention and care, and I'm sure they will enjoy!
B0021L8V0W|2.0|I saw it once.  Don't believe the reviews about this being a smart or intelligent thriller.  Smart is not a CIA agent open firing at someone in the middle of bumper to bumper traffic where innocent people could easily be hit by a ricochet.  Intelligent is not obsessing if one of your own is a traitor after the same informant kills two of your people.  I have no interest in seeing it again.
B0009A41WE|3.0|At the outset I should say that Uchida is my favorite living pianist. I have heard her many times live with the NY Philharmonic and have most of her CDs, all of which I'm most happy with and have only minor quibbles with (if any).<br /><br />I bought this CD to round out my collection, which also includes Fleisher, Gillels (both with the Cleveland), and Perahia (with the RC). I'd recommend any of these three over this one.<br /><br />This cycle, unfortunately, should be avoided. First, I received the Decca release from one of Amazon's resellers, not the Phillips. I've always been pleased with Phillips releases; the sound quality rivals DG (well, almost).<br /><br />Second, this Decca version has only two orchestras (RC and Rundfunks), not the three of the Phillips, and the sound quality of the orchestras is poor, and the playing of the Rundfunks worse.<br /><br />Uchida's playing is fine--the sound quality good, if not sterling--if a bit too gentile and aristocratic. There's simply not the requisite fire here, not enough fort&eacute; in the piano. Also, it sounds as if she's playing alongside a recording here, not with live orchestras (in all five concerti), and it sounds as if each is going in a separate direction. There's musical co-mingling here, but not togetherness.<br /><br />The 32 variations save my rating at three stars, as I find nothing to fault there.<br /><br />Perhaps the Phillips has superior sound quality. However, the above mentioned faults would still be here.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|Any fool can be a parent, and the average American parent is a fool.<br /><br />Amy Chua is not a fool.<br /><br />I taught English, journalism and reading in the American public schools from 1975 to 2005. I experienced the decline of the American family while working 60 to 100 hours a week teaching, writing lesson plans and correcting the work my students turned in.<br /><br />When I was born, children were still taught to be seen and not heard. Most of my generation was polite and respectful of our elders -- not so today.<br /><br />My mother taught me how to read and I was required to learn and play a musical instrument. For me that was the accordion. However, my parents weren't as tough as Chua was, and I don't remember how to play the accordion, which is something I regret.<br /><br />In America, any semblance of a parent's freedom of choice of how to raise a child all but vanished starting in the 1960s when the Self-esteem Arm of Political Correctness (SAP) became the only acceptable way to act, think, and speak as a parent.<br /><br />Parents that deviated from the self-esteem model were driven underground and Chua was perceptive enough to see that.<br /><br />Sophia, Amy Chua's oldest daughter, shows what SAP has done to America's children on page 191 (hardcover).  Sophia says, \\"Do you know what a good daughter I am? Everyone else I know parties all the time, and they drink and do drugs. And do you know what I do? Every day I run straight home from school.  I run....\\"<br /><br />What Sophia said is true. My wife and I heard much the same story from our daughter, and I saw this self-destructive behavior become the norm during the thirty years I was a teacher in the US public schools.<br /><br />I suggest strongly that if you plan to be a parent soon or in the future, read Amy Chua's memoir so you know what your parenting choices are. For anyone who has a child already in school, it may be too late to reverse the damage that has been done by being a SAP.<br /><br />Knowing that most Americans have a \\"very\\" short attention span, I wrote the longer, more detailed review and posted it on my Blog at iLookChina dot netthe longer, more detailed review and posted it on my Blog at iLookChina dot net
B00127RAJY|2.0|I gave it 2 rather than 1 star because I did get sweaty & I did work muscles that I have not in the past (despite working out pretty regularly).    However, as others have mentioned, it's killer on the knees.  You know how you are supposed to feel good about yourself all day after a good workout?  This one made me feel lightheaded and tense all day!  Also, the intro lecture (that you can't fast-forward through) is really going to get to you after awhile.    Try something nicer to your body.  You can still work hard and get results without getting physically and emotionally tortured!
B000002H33|3.0|While this album single handedly got me into heavy metal, introduced me to many of my favorite bands, and metallica was my first big concert, this album grows boring to the experienced and matured ear.  The scooped tone of the guitars (aka guitar tones with high bass and treble, but with little to no mid range) covers the bass and bass drums up, and really isn't as heavy or as punchy as it should be (especially when you hear the scooped guitar tone live, it just muddles everything up).  The lyrics are pretty immature and mediocre, but still a step up from Ride the Lightening's lyrics.   The lead guitar work is also quite mediocre, as it becomes obvious to guitar players that Kirk Hammett has already started recycling licks instead of creating melodies.  The lead tone is also not quite as bueno as the Kill em all and Ride the Lightening.    The thing this album suffers from more than anything else is the fact that the songs are TOO LONG.  Now I love long songs, such as Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner by Maiden, or any Opeth track, but there is quite simply too little music spread over too much space.  Master of Puppets is such an awesome song, but when the cool and original instrumental section goes into over 2 minutes of what we have already heard, what is my incentive to listen to it?  The thing that should not be is not a long song, but its constant repetitiveness makes it feel like its ten minutes long.  (I know I'll get hell for this)  Orion has some awesome rhythms, and great melodic solos, but it could easily be 2 minutes shorter and a much better track.  Damage Inc. is just kinda silly.      While I love this album for nostalgic reasons, it is perfect for 14 year olds, but if you still think they are the best band in the world by the time you're twenty, you are just being ignorant (That excludes loving them for their early concerts.  Those might have been the bees knees.  I wouldn't know)
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been alternating this DVD with 6W6P for about 40 days. Great results. Dropped a clothing size and gained a lot of strength and stamina. I'm hooked! I'm not bored at all because I have mixed up the levels from day 1 and I work out 3 days, then take a rest day, and so on. I also power walk.     I thought everyone complaining about joint pain were a bunch of babies. Well, I must be a baby too! My knees! I realized that the surface I'm working out on is too hard. It's a cement foundation/sub-floor with carpeting over it. A gym, like the kinds Jillian works in, have aerobic flooring. I can't afford to install an aerobic floor, but I settled for doing the dvd on a super thick fitness mat and that has really helped. Also, I use gliding discs (well, paper plates) for all plank cardio moves like the plank jacks, mountain climbers, etc. It's awesome and no impact and I'm getting ripped up abs. I also use them for the jumping oblique twists in level 2. By using a super thick mat and paper plates I've taken out over half of the impact and my knees feel great.     This is a great, fun, fast moving workout that really challenges your strength and cardio. It's really tough. And you will get back into your jeans like I did baby!     There are negatives to this DVD. Jillian is no Cathe Friedrich, and doesn't do even a 1/4 of the workout. Instead we are to follow the back up exercisers. The advanced backup exerciser is lame and cheats. Not very motivating. Also, they don't workout to the beat of the music. Finally, no real tricepts exercises. I'd have liked a dip or a French press or something.     Most of all, I am so proud of myself for working out this hard. I am really proud.

B0015DROBO|2.0|This is just one man's opinion but halfway through THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, I found myself seriously wondering if I had purchased the right book. As every book store seems to have it predominantly on display, Hollywood is drooling over the movie version, Amazon is heavily promoting it, then there had to be some wonderful, thoughtful and insightful mystery that certainly was not the one I was reading.<br /><br />The characters are disjointed and oddly unaffecting. You don't feel much love for anyone presented as they come across as a group of highly unprofessional twits who have no capacity for love.<br /><br />After the weak variety of characters passes, you find youself plodding through acres of background descriptions that seem more akin to a teen-age girls diary ramblings than that of a professional author. In a dull, nearly meandering way, we know about the climate, what they are eating and where the characters go. Never once do you get a feeling that any of them are even slightly intersting. What is surprising is that the author, Stieg Larsson, seems absolutely fascinated with his creations - eerily so.  It does not matter how gross, abusive, perverted or nasty they get, Larsson seems to find them a fascinating study of human deprevity. There is no way anyone can gild any lily to make such nasty and uncaring people interesting to the reader.<br /><br />After a short time, the actual mystery (a missing girl) becomes forgettable as any energies that should have been pumped into that plot is left undeveloped while we are continually reminded how mean-spirited and abusive the \\"heroes\\" of the story are.<br /><br />In all, it is a strange book that seems more the brain child of a smart PR agent than a gifted author.
0307272702|5.0|Anyone who has tried diets many times before only to fail MUST read this book! This is not a diet book - it's a science book, but one that is easy to understand for the average person. It makes a very strong case that carbohydrates, especially sugars, are to blame for obesity. I took Taubes' advice from the book right away after reading it last month, and I've already lost 12 pounds. This is the easiest time I've ever had losing weight!    Again, if you are looking for a diet book that tells you exactly what to eat every day and the exact amounts, then no, this book does not do that (there are some suggested daily menus in the back of the book, but I did not bother with them). However, if you have been thinking about low-carb and are still skeptical, this book will have the evidence to convince you.
1416550542|5.0|This book kept me spellbound from the first page to the last!  It is filled with love, heartbreak, deep soul searching, tears and laughter. It intertwines three generations (each chapter a different time) beautifully! Often, I have trouble keeping track and end up putting those type of books down. Not so here.... I loved the fairytale aspect and reminded me of old books from the past. Wonderful... you get to know the characters(love some ,hate some) When it ends you are filled with emotion!  A must for my private library!.     PS - After reading,Kate's interview, I love it even more! Thank You, !

0307473708|1.0|I agree with the minority of reviewers that this novel is poorly written.  It sucks in every respect, honestly.  I don't expect much from genre fiction as a rule, but this has been the worst book I've read since sixth grade (when I thought Grisham, e.g., was good stuff).  I think there's little use explaining myself here; if you're university educated in the arts & sciences or read literary fiction it'll be apparent to you after reading the first page that this isn't any good.  If you're not the above, then I guess you might like it.  I know a few people who hold it as their favorite book; one of those people, while reading 1984, once asked me, \\"Is anything gonna happen in it?\\"...so, yeah.    I actually plan on reading the rest of the series.  I'm a fan of the show and for some reason I have this odd feeling that I must know the life of the other Dexter.  Maybe I'll be surprised by the rest of the series.  Perhaps Lindsay has hired a skilled novelist to write the rest of the series under his name?  (Do skilled ghostwriters exist?)
B002SRQ214|5.0|Easy to install and not sure why I have read complaints on the heatsink/fan, it's beastly, just hard to install. I can now play Crysis with 4x anti-alias and only get small hiccups every now and then, but never when enemies are around. Time to upgrade my GPU soon!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I found this book to be very well written and while the ride was fantastic, the questions left unanswered intrigue me.  For many this may seem to be the end of the story, but I think this series has the ability to branch out in many directions.  There are still so many questions.  Is the wall down for good?  What happenes to Dani, the queen and Christopher as well as so many other great characters?    I really enjoyed how so many of the author's characters from other books came into this saga and how the history of the druids entered into Mac's story.  Now where do we go from here?
B0034G4P7G|4.0|This film is very entertaining, exciting to watch, and provides a fascinating story about Facebook, a web site that has changed our way of life over just a few years. However, \\"The Social Network\\" is just that - a business drama, at face value. It offers little of exactly how Facebook has changed us, or the nature of social networking; the fact that Facebook is at the heart of the story is purely consequential.<br /><br />If you want to be entertained for 2 hours or so, \\"The Social Network\\" is a good choice; just don't expect anything more than a story.
0345479092|2.0|I whole heartedly agree with having your baby on some sort of routine and we have followed that pretty well.  However, I feel like the EASY routine only works somewhat well for a newborn.  I think it's too early for the activity part--most newborns are so sleepy that they easily fall asleep while nursing or while being held for even 5 minutes.  Her techniques for waking up a baby while nursing really don't work.  If I rub my baby's back or hand, she gets even cozier and sleeps more.  I think the author needs to provide some real-world suggestions for getting your baby to take a full feeding.      Also, my main beef with the author is the issue of sleep.  I have read the book and have read the chapter on sleep probably a dozen times.  I feel like the only suggestions she has on sleep are what to do when bad habits are already in place.  But how do you get a newborn to fall asleep???  I do have a fairly easy baby, but she doesn't sleep well in her crib or pack n play.  I think she's too young to cry it out (she's 2 weeks old), but I can't keep picking her up like the author suggests and calming her down 30-40 times a night.  Some practical newborn sleep tips would be helpful.  She is against rocking your baby to sleep or letting them fall asleep while nursing.  She suggests a pacifier, but I think newborns are unable to keep a pacifier in their mouths for more than a few minutes at time and then they wail when it falls out.  So what exactly are exhausted parents to do in the first few weeks??  That is the answer I've been looking for and what seems lacking in this book.
B000HIVIOW|4.0|This childrens Clasic, \\"The Snowman\\", should be on everyones Christmas wish list if they dont already own it.  It is so charming, touching,light, fairy-like,and at the same time a DVD or book that anyone, child, teenager or adult,would love.A bit in the same way as Winnie the Pooh is not just for small children.  I love it, and really bought it for myself, and my \\"inner child!\\"  I highly recommend it -buy it for YOUR inner child!
B0001KZM3O|2.0|This album sounds like a continuation of all the parts of the Wall I didn't like: bring the boys back home, vera lynn, etc., with the TV sounds effects and people shouting.  OK for a movie score or multimedia masterpeice like the wall, but without the good songs in there to hold it together it just falls apart.    This deserves its reputation as the worst post-Barrett Pink Floyd album.
B004G6009K|5.0|I just saw \\"Tangled\\" this weekend.  I was pleasantly surprised as to just how good a Disney film this was!  Tangled is a well written, fairly well paced film. The graphics were amazing!  I was especially impressed with the renderings & textures of Rapunzel's hair, & the worn wood around her window/doorway in the tower, beautiful work!    My only criticism is about 2/3rd's of the way thru the movie, I felt it dragged and could've been shortened by a couple of minutes, but all in all, a wonderful, classic Disney princess movie that should stand proud next to Snow White, Cinderella & the Little Mermaid.
B002AGIEYG|4.0|Sir Simon Rattle and the Berliners have been catching a fair amount of flak in recent years whenever they ventured to record German romantic repertoire together. Some of the criticism was not without reason. While Sir Simon could be exceptionally insightful in French repertoire and gripping in 20th century music, his Schubert or Strauss could be rather noncommital and pedestrian. Other criticism was plainly out of place. There is still a certain faction of Karajan-aficionados who haven't forgiven the Berlin Philharmonic for giving up its trademark Karajan sound (which in any case was more a product of DG's recording studio than reality). Those people will never be pleased anyway, as they are too biased to notice that today's Berlin Philharmonic is more virtuosic, more versatile and possesses far better brass and wind sections than Karajan ever had at his disposal.     That said, this exceptionally fine Brahms cycle should not only silence Rattle's critics but is one that you should hear, although it is not entirely without caveats.     The good new first: If this Brahms 1st Symphony were available as an individual release, I would give it 5+ stars magna cum laude. It is a magnificent achievement, and among the dozens of different recordings I own it is presently my absolute favorite. This is a grippingly riveting, dramatic reading that never fails to pull the listener along. The winds cry out in agony over the steady timpani beat in the opening of the first movement as well as any. The inner movements are marvels of phrasing, and in the finale the opening struggle leads up to probably the most glorious horn and flute solos on record with Radek Baborak (horn) and Emmanuel Pahud (flute) delivering absolutely superlative performances, which in and of themselves would be worth the price of admission. The inner two movements benefit from stellar woodwind playing and a conductor who gives his players just the amount of freedom they need while judiciously controlling balances and flow. Throughout the 1st symphony, Rattle seems to have paid special attention to carefully phrasing and articulating the low strings, cellos in particular, which leads to a simultaneously wonderfully warm and yet transparent reading that nicely reveals Brahms's contrapuntal writing without making it feel didactic.     The rest of the cycle, while still very good, is simply not so superlative on an interpretive level to merit giving five stars to the entire set. Depending on how you like your Brahms, it may or may not be your cup of tea. If you are shopping for a complete Brahms symphony cycle and want dramatic intensity and rhythmic incisiveness, you will be better served by Günter Wand ([[ASIN:B00005QHUZ Brahms: Symphonies Nos. 1-4 (Box Set)]]) or Sir Georg Solti ([[ASIN:B0000041Z5 Brahms: The Symphonies]]). As the cover art suggests, Rattle takes the remaining three symphonies more as an introspective autumnal journey, aided by the most gorgeous symphonic color palette that only the Berlin Philhamonic can provide. If that is how you like your Brahms, you will be very happy with Rattle.     The Second Symphony is generally almost as successful as the first. The first three movements flow beautifully, with a great deal of subtle flexibility in tempo and excellent playing from all sections. In the last movement, alas, we run into a few of Sir Simon's more unfortunate mannerisms. He takes the piano introduction at a considerably slower tempo than the forte central statement of the main theme, even though Brahms asks for allegro con spirito from the start, and even then the movement doesn't really take off despite Rattle's otherwise acceptable basic tempo for the bulk of the movement. Rattle exacerbates this interpretively incoherent weirdness with a few bizarre subito pianos and crescendos which are nowhere to be found in the score. The result is a finale that lacks the flow of the preceding movements and doesn't deliver the exhilarating conclusion to what came before. If the finale had been on the same level as the preceding movements, the 2nd, too, could have merited 5 stars.    The Third Symphony is in my mind the weakest of the lot, mainly on account of a rather flabby first movement. I will concede that you don't have to play the opening movement of the 3rd as a life-and-death struggle. Other valid interpretations are plausible and can be done successfully. But this movement is such a marvellous exhibition of Brahms' mastery of hemiola that I can't help but feel let down on account of Rattle's lack of rhythmic incisiveness or sheer forward momentum. The problem, if you do this movement this way, is that you are left with little contrast to the inner two movements. In effect, Rattle's Brahms 3rd has three inner movements and no opening movement. Given that the 3rd even ends on a quiet note, this becomes a little too much sameness for one work that is capable of so much contrast. That said, the three following movements are done extremely well. The third movement, in particular, is played with a great deal of risk-taking in the flexibility of the phrasing, but like the good chamber musicians they are, the Berliners stick together perfectly. One might have wanted the tempo to be a tick faster here to contrast this Poco allegretto with the preceding Andante, but interpretively the movement works very well as it is and isn't excessively indulgent compared to the historic spectrum. The horn solo is once again a dream and peters off in a perfect blend with the bassoon that takes up the phrase. In the last movement, Rattle nicely manages a general sense of tragic inevitability.    The Fourth Symphony is mostly well done. Rattle again takes the first movement in a rather autumnal fashion, but builds the development very well, with a fine sense of inevitable tragedy. Overall, the movement makes a very coherent whole. This time, however, the second movement is problematic. Yes, the BPO horns, clarinets and bassoons play so absolutely gorgeously that you can sympathize with a desire to listen to them for as long as possible. But Sir Simon takes the second movement so broadly that he is on the verge of stretching the thread that holds the movement together so thin that at times it threatens to fray and snap. The remainder of the symphony goes well, but the passacaglia of the finale isn't quite as taut as it could be.     In sum, this is a set that is on the whole a pleasure to listen to, mostly because the Berliners play like the finest set of chamber musicians in the world, with a natural sense of phrase and a rare willingness to take risks that often pays great dividends. The 1st symphony is one of the finest on records without any reservations. The second is close, apart from a somewhat incoherent finale. The other two suffer from an indulgence in beautiful tone which gets in the way of dramatic arc and structural logic. Beautiful, if sheer beauty of sound is what you want, but more can be said in these endlessly fascinating works.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Awesome movie. It really inspired me. The soundtrack is great also. It's weird because Mark Zuckerberg actually went to my highschool before he attended a private school to get into Harvard. I'm slightly older so I probably spotted him when he was a kid. My friends families mingle with his so it's a small world. My cousins also went to Harvard and knew his sister. Hard to believe how much he achieved and how passionate he is. I'm sure parts of the movie are exaggerated. On the other hand Fincher did have his blogs. The girl at the bar, her name was changed, but that event did happen. The court depositions were also real. Eduardo restored his name as co-founder of Facebook and I believe owns a 5 percent share of the company to this date. Though movies are always entertainment and you shouldn't believe everything you see.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Despicable Me was one of the surprise hits of 2010 and a film I was so charmed by I've seen it five times as of this review. While [[ASIN:B00275EHJG Toy Story 3]] and even How to Train Your Dragon may have been the better animated films from last year, it was Despicable Me that I most thoroughly enjoyed. The film's writers take the idea that the villain is usually more fascinating than the hero and make the villain the protagonist of their story. Although, Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is hardly the villain he aspires to be.    As the film opens, we learn that The Great Pyramid of Giza has been stolen and replaced with an inflatable replica. When wannabe super-villain Gru hears of this, he realizes he must do something very big and announces to his assistant Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) and his minions (more on that in a moment) that he will steal the moon. After Gru and his minions successfully steal a shrink ray it is stolen by Vector (Jason Segel), the new super-villain in town. Trying unsuccessfully to break into Vector's fortress, Gru spots three orphaned girls named Agnes, Edith, and Margo selling cookies and adopts them in order to get his shrink ray back.     The creative team behind this movie deserves serious recognition for all the inventiveness that went into this movie. Gru lives in a large, evil looking house that happens to be right in the middle of a suburban setting. He has a monstrous looking \\"dog\\" named Kyle. Even Gru himself is a terrific creation. Physically, Gru resembles a caricature of several James Bond villains while sporting an accent that falls somewhere between Russian and Austrian. While I doubt this was Carell's inspiration, I felt the voice sounded a lot like Tommy Wiseau.     The voice-work in this film is absolutely splendid. Obviously, Carell creates one of the most amusing, memorable protagonists of an animated film in sometime. Watching the film, it's hard to believe that it's Steve Carell. Also giving inspired voice-work is Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario. Obviously, there's a hint of Brand in there but he's nearly unrecognizable as well and his performance as Dr. Nefario is perfect. Julie Andrews, in an ironic twist, briefly voices Gru's nasty mother which is a treat to say the least. Segel seems to be having fun as Vector and Will Arnett turns in a great voice performance the evil Mr. Perkins. Elsie Fisher gives one of the most adorable voice performances I've ever heard as Agnes, the youngest of the three girls. You could make a valid argument that if Agnes doesn't warm your heart, you may not have a soul.     It is Gru's minions that steal the show however. The minions are small, yellow creatures with their own language that serve as Gru's multi-purpose henchmen. The minions are the most adorable, hilarious creatures to emerge from an animated film in 2010. They are responsible for some of the greatest sight gags (the glowstick scene, anyone?) and some of the most hilarious moments in the film. If done right, I would watch a full-length minion movie.     Creativity and originality run rampant throughout this film. The CGI animation is very colorful and vibrant, the voice cast does some great work here, the characters are adorable/memorable, there are some great throwaway lines throughout the film, and the music by Pharrell Williams is appropriately cute and catchy for the film. I have now seen this film five times and I admit it's not as great as it was the first four, but it's one of the few animated films geared directly for children that adults will enjoy just as much. Adults in particular will enjoy the \\"Lehman Brothers\\" gag and \\"The Godfather\\" reference. This movie is truly something special and is my favorite animated comedy of 2010. For an animated movie made for children this film succeeds more as a comedy than many live action films geared for adults do.    GRADE: A-    *As for the DVD editions, there's a single-disc edition and a slightly more expensive edition that comes with three Minion movies. The Minion movies are about 3 minutes long apiece and are amusing, but I doubt I'll ever watch them again. If you want to shell out the extra money for them, by all means do so...But that second DVD may never end up in your DVD player again.

B003UESJH4|5.0|I write this just after reading that The King's Speech has more Oscar nominations at 12 than any other film of 2010.  And that couldn't be more fair.  This is a great movie.  Colin Firth as King George VI will tear at your heart as he struggles to get his words out, and the stuttering is almost less poignant than the terrible silences as he is trying to make the words come (a little googling will get you to actual footage of George VI speaking and those silences are gripping.  I read somewhere that Firth in preparing for his role found them so as well.)  It's a perfect performance from an actor whose range of roles throughout his career constantly amazes me -- A Single Man, of course, but going way back to Apartment Zero, for example -- and he never fails to deliver.  Geoffrey Rush as his unorthodox speech therapist, Lionel Logue, and Helena Bonham Carter as his wife are almost as good.  I also liked how The King's Speech upends the conventional wisdom about his brother and Mrs. Wallis Simpson who, far from being noble for choosing love over the throne, are portrayed as fatuous and selfish.  Not being a scholar of British royalty, I'm not sure whether this is a more accurate take than the conventional one, but I appreciated the different view.  My only quibble -- the climatic address to the nation plays too long and does conveniently overlook the apparent historical reality that Logue's work with the King's public speaking began long before that.  But that's called dramatic license and, in my view, to build the drama of the movie is perfectly OK.  This is a definite Do Not Miss.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|Just got this light, the install was relatively easy. The only issue is you can't tell on the LED which is positive/negative, nor can you figure out on the OEM light +-? Just switch it around if it doesn't turn on.    The light is definitely a big improvement, its much brighter and it hurts to look at the light so don't bother. With the OEM bulb you could look at it without issue.     The switch, well this doesn't even seem to work? The feel is not really like the quality of the OEM end cap. But for the price the LED is wonderful. To bad there is no option to buy without the switch to save a little money.     All in all I highly recommend to anyone looking to get new life and possibly better battery life out of there mini mag light.

1848566190|4.0|This is a beautiful book that does not exhaustively detail every piece of work Struzan has ever done, but rather provides a selective walkthrough of the artist's career, with his own commentary. Like many creative types working in Hollywood who have gone 'on record' to talk about the frustrations they have faced (like, for example [[ASIN:0375703195 William Goldman]], and [[ASIN:0451205332 Julia Phillips]]) Struzan's career evolved into an ever-increasing farce involving nameless suits decreeing 'art'-direction that eventually burnt the artist out (they even went so far as to have another nameless artist paint something over a portion of his work without telling him). One feels a frustration at the depressing homogenisation, conservative attitudes, and the dearth of creativity involved in the (post) modern Hollywood machine, although it does provide the reader with a fascinating insight into Struzan's creative process as he provides multiple sketches and differing takes whilst trying to prevent 'too many cooks' from spoiling things. Indeed, his sketches are awe-inducing in their own right, and I often wished he'd painted an alternative poster from some of his preliminaries, rather than the sketch the studio selected (I think specifically of his Revenge of the Sith poster). This book is not definitive- some of my favourite Strew posters were from the cinema re-releases of the original Star Wars trilogy in the 1990s which do not appear, but for both the artist interested in Struzan's process, through to the film-fan nostalgic for the posters that adorned the films of their youth, this is a splendid purchase, and takes pride of place on my shelf alongside the similarly beautiful [[ASIN:1401227821 Adam Hughes]] and [[ASIN:0375714901 Alex Ross]] coffee-table books.

B004HU6YZ4|5.0|I was thoroughly pleased when I listened to Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes for the first time, and since that listen, the record keeps on improving.<br /><br />With this album, I obviously expected good quality music (that warranted a preorder) in typical Social D fashion.<br /><br />This album is 100% Social Distortion, no if's, and's, or but's about it. As a band, they've obviously matured over the years, and have been surprisingly consistent in their music.<br />This album is interesting in that it is not a real deviation from Social D style, but it is different - in a great way. Starting off with a great instrumental was the first thing I noticed, not very typical, but very good nevertheless. The album continues, but with varying rhythms and sounds which clearly distinguishes the songs from each other. There's a bunch of slower songs on this album, and I'm not complaining at all about them. Mike Ness and Social Distortion aren't pretending to be young punk rockers; they're aging (in a good way ;) rock n' roll artists, and this album reflects that. Some lyrics are just as corny as they have always been, the music will always remind you that this is indeed Social D, and the new songs are a great addition to Social D's record.

B000W7JWUA|1.0|This is not a game for families with children. The board is very flimsy. The six-piece border does not stay together. The hex pieces do not stay in. All of the little pieces (too little) that are supposed to somehow stay put on top of the board are too easily moved inadvertently. There are about 100 little pieces to keep track of.     The game requires a hard, flat surface. it will not stay together over a tablecloth.     The rules for play are not clearly laid out. I had to make several trial runs to understand it.     In short, it is an overpriced cheaply made game that is hard to understand and impossible to explain to children. [[ASIN:B000W7JWUA The Settlers of Catan]]
0802473156|3.0|I think the basic concept is sound.  Folks respond  to different ways of showing love.  I don't think the 5 categories are exclusive nor do they represent the universe of ways people best receive love and affection.  The author addresses this last point somewhat by saying there are many dialects within the 5 languages. Some might view that as a cop out.    My  strongest complaint is that the language of the book is dumb downed to reach the lowest grade of reader. Like I say, the basic concept is good, but I was somewhat disappointed overall.    The other thing is the book is more appropriate  for long term relationships that have suffered thru neglect.  I would have preferred to read something where the focus is on nurturing and sustaining the in love experience.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|This is such a wonderful show and certainly deserves our support. Every week, we get the equivalent of a broadway show in our homes and the entire DVD set will provide many, many hours of quality entertainment. I don't have live television here in the woods of Appalachia, and my husband and I had never heard of this show until we found it on Amazon, but we just love it.     While I have noticed that people comment about the half-season releases and cost (and leave not-so-positive remarks, especially on the season two reviews), I am sure that it costs quite a bit of money to bring this show to us (several million dollars for some episodes, I have read) and we should honor that and try to help those who are working so hard to bring this show to us.     With actors, writers, sets, costumes, locations, live musicians, etc., this show is very expensive to create, I am sure. And people have complained about paying $30-40 to see a season of such quality entertainment, or a half-season for $20-30? I don't understand that. That is less than the price of one ticket to a live show and we get to view a show repeatedly that includes comedy, drama, amazing musical numbers, and ground-breaking opportunities for people to view and understand characters that represent many diverse groups and individuals in our culture.     That kind of a quality production doesn't come cheap and we are so fortunate to have the opportunity to experience this at such a reasonable price, even at retail. This show helps to break stereotypes and encourage acceptance of others, at the same time that it is highly entertaining and very funny. How brave for a show to be one of the first to spotlight issues like bullying, create tolerance through demonstrating the intolerance of some characters, and include characters that represent our actual population, not one televisually created by those \\"in power\\" who may assume that we want to only see one vision of the world.    I would encourage people to purchase this set and pay retail in order to support such quality television and the people who bring it to us. If we don't honor those who give us something worthwhile, shows like this won't long exist in the production world of cut budgets, cheap sitcoms, and inane reality shows. Our support will ensure that quality programming will continue to happen. For the makers of this show, thank you for doing such a wonderful job, and providing encouragement for those who feel uncomfortably different, although we all contribute a great gift to the world through our difference and uniqueness. Well done.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|If you like Forbidden Planet, then this is a perfect way to enjoy it more.    This is my favorite scifi movie.

B0037QGS0K|4.0|The cast is very good.  Without giving away too much, the plot primarily centers around a successful professional woman (Julianne Moore) who suspects her College Professor Husband (Liam Neeson) of cheating.  The game is afoot, albeit in a dysfunctional, erotica way, when the wife chooses to use amanda seyfried to confirm or deny the wife's suspisicons.  What follows is for you, the viewer, to absorb and deduce as to what will happen next.  This is what makes this flick interesting.  Of course, from this guy's perspective, it doesn't hurt that the two main female leads are very attractive.  This is an enjoyable, off the beaten path film, that is well worth the amazon price.  Not too disturbing, and with many common issues experienced or at least pondered by couples in today's society. Finally, the ending definately has an unexpected twist and leaves you thinking what exactly did the wife learn about this experience?

B004856SQ8|4.0|Great story filled with abit over the top action scene with amazing video & audio quality. If you like action movie, this is a must buy collection. Cheers.
B0046MOV8U|3.0|I thought The Beyonce experience was a much more REAL concert video.   This is good, but will make you feel like you are watching a produced video, lots of flashing back and forth between different venues, was giving me a headache.

B004B8DH98|5.0|As soon as you start to see that a film doesn't bother to explain most of what seems to be the main plot, you should start looking elsewhere for clues of what the film is actually about.  You must assume that unless explicitly stated, no one would make a film about nothing -- even films about nothing do really have a point.  This film is very subtle, it is slow, but if paid enough attention to, it is definitely worth watching.<br /><br />Subtly is kind of the point in this film anyway.  Most of the characters in this film are in situations that prohibit them, in one way or another, from making any real human connections.  The main character, Mr. Butterfly, is an assassin/gun dealer who seems to have found love in the beginning of the movie, only to have had to shoot his lover in the head shortly after a beautiful and intimate time with her.  Another character is a priest, who fathers an illegitimate child, but is prohibited from openly having a connection to it.  Yet another character, Clara, is a prostitute, and the inability to have real connections to other humans doesn't really need explaining.  One of the most mysterious characters is the main character's counterpart, another assassin who works out the purchase of a weapon from Mr. Butterfly.  Each character in the film consistently mistakes what we would normally consider gestures of attraction/consideration as real.  There are some truly beautiful moments in the movie when you see the character hopeful that something human is happening to them, then the return to themselves as if it had never happened when they realize they were wrong.  In real life, we would attempt to cover our own transition between The Hopeful and The Realist as subtly as possible.  In the film, these moments are fleeting and they are very subtle, and there is a reason why there is so little music in the film:  you'd never notice these moments if you were blinded by music and action.<br /><br />This film is not an action movie, and in myopinion, it is not a thriller.  It is about human interaction and the quiet desperation in which we all too often find ourselves.  We've all been there, and we all know what it's like to hope someone likes us and to have our defenses ready when we find out otherwise.  We all have created our own prison, made from fear of rejection or otherwise, and have had to live with the unintended consequences of those prisons.  This film attempts to show these prisons through the characters' chosen profession -- that's why there is an assassin, a priest and a prostitue.  It's kind of brilliant.<br /><br />In my opinion, art is about causing us to reflect so that we may become better versions of ourselves, and this film certainly does that.  It bravely states \\"Look at who we are.  What are we doing to ourselves?\\"  Bravo.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Just a product review for the BD fans. I think a few of the storyline gripes out there (and here at Amazon) get answered if you actually sit through all of these special features, albeit there are a few worth watching and a few worth skipping.<br /><br />The sound and picture are as expected from a Disney BD with the only real shortcomings glaring though when they used certain cameras during quick-edits in the races. The sound is great and adds to the immersion experience they went for in the races. The supplements are time consuming, but will hopefully satisfy both the purists and general fans alike. The main menu brings up a description of each selection with a time stamp:<br /><br />* Heart of a Champion, 14:45 minutes. A light biopic with interviews and not as much stock footage as I would have liked for it being about him. For those wanting a brief background on him or teachers wanting to show something off on this product - this is your best bet.<br />* Choreographing, 6:24 minutes. A quick ad plug for Semler and a all too-short description on the cameras and how they used them.<br />* Director interview with Penny, 21:10 minutes. The best supplement for the people wanting to know the human background and real story material. The director sits down with Penny and has a very candid conversation about the film and how things really happened. A nice empowerment piece for ladies, and she gives an interesting talk about how she looks at fear - it played well in the store.<br />* Audio Commentary/Director: To be honest, I got more from the interview in this case.<br />* Deleted scenes, 10:30 minutes. Director intro and optional commentary for the scenes. Having watched the film first, the optional opening takes away from how they did the closing of the movie - I prefer what is in the film and the scenes overall are not worth the watch.<br />* Music video with AJ Michalka. Not a well made video with the song, and even my 8-year old daughter mentioned how bad the \\"lip-syncing\\" looked. Skipper.<br />* Multi Angle Secretariat option, takes around an hour to get through it all. The big races shown in the film are recreated with animation from different angles depending on which person you select to narrate the \\"experience\\". You have the choice of hearing a jockey, a spectator, a historian, a sports writer and then the actual race footage. Each animation set after a talking head interview has period information scrolling by and simultaneously popping up on the bottom and top of the screen while his races are detailed. Time consuming and a little tedious with how the animation looks, but you get a great deal of material, and will probably only be interesting for hardcore fans of the horse and how he raced.<br />* Disc 2 = [[ASIN:B004DK5CW4 Secretariat]].<br /><br />When playing the film and you select the pop-up menu, it shrinks the film uninterrupted to a 20% screen and allows you to see all of the same supplement description as if at the main menu. The only glitch I came across (most likely my player) is if you select the Info option it does nothing except show the commentary disclaimer. The best crowd-pleaser supplement was her interview, teen girls liked the music video the most (I have never heard of this singer - guess I am out of it) and the young kids liked the cheesy animation features as it looked like a video game (which it gives you a website to visit and play a game).<br /><br />Definite recommendation if you are considering buying it. Spanish, French and English 5.1 with a 2.0 Descriptive Track, which in a film like this almost competed with the play-by-play of the race commentator narration.Angle Secretariat option, takes around an hour to get through it all.

B004FGN3WC|5.0|OK, first you can get this puppy for less with extra perks, like the limited ed. ALIEN poster and a gift card for some collectibles here: [...]<br /><br />Second, this ROCKS!!!<br /><br />Even though 2 additional prequels are being planned (I believe) - this is one awesome EGG-LAMP / Blu-Ray combo you don't wanna miss.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|I highly recommend this novel. It had my attention from the very first page, literally, and that rarely happens for me! This is a clever, funny, delightful story. Read it!
B00009NHC5|4.0|I can't say I LOVED this movie, but I will say that I enjoyed it for what it is: A LIVE PLAY on DVD.  I didn't find it frightening AT ALL (as I had read in some of the reviews and had hoped for - prior to purchasing), although I DO consider and respect that everyone DOES view SAME things DIFFERENTLY (and that's okay).    If you enjoy watching LIVE stage-plays, whether ritually or occasionally, in my own opinion, you will find this movie well-worth watching right from your TV set.     However, please keep in mind it's an OLDER film with OLDER actors.  While, in my opinion, the actors did a GREAT job acting (for THEIR day-in-age), today's generation may consider the acting and/or characters \\"too-old-fashion.\\"  But, all in all, it's a well-written play.
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|After an attack at home Frank Moses (Willis) recruits his old CIA buddies for help in revenge.  Using all the tricks he knows Moses hunts down the person responsible for the attack while trying to avoid a tenacious CIA agent trying to stop him.  This is another movie that falls into a common trap.  Assemble an All-Star cast, realize everyone will watch for cast, slack off on rest.  To me it feels like the bigger the stars put together the bigger the dissapointment.  I'm not saying this is a bad movie, it's just very average.  With the cast assembled (and the Golden Globe nomination for Best Picture) I was expecting hilarious.  It had funny parts, but a little flat in some areas.  It sounds like I'm bashing it but it was a good movie.  I was just expecting more.  You will definately have a good time watching, just don't get your hopes too high. The best part of the movie hands down is John Malkovich, watch for him if nothing else.  I give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - If it came on TV
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Melodic metal (not hair metal) was at the top of music scene. Because the guitar playing was good , the singing was good, and the playing and writing was good. Then came the hideous 90's in which melody was forsaken and thrash came to lower the listenership of metal down to almost nothing.  Now it's for zit faced methheads who want someone to growl at them, back then groups like this conquered the world because they played so well. This one is in fact a real metal classic with not a bad song on this one.  The band would never be this hard again but they would stil be a great force of great melodic metal for many years to come. And they still sound like this live, even a few years back! What a show they put on.
B00000K3CK|5.0|I wanted this in the original B & W and only the colorized versions were available in stores I looked at this season.  Glad to have gotten it without any delay or issues.  Good service, good film!
B001UV4XHY|3.0|Many people deserve second chances, I guess movies are the same. I saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and fell asleep whilst watching it. Reading the book I really didn't build my hopes up, having already done that with 'Watchmen' which was disappointing. However this is a new year, and just recently seeing all six parts of the movies, I feel compelled to review this movie. It is a journey movie, and the locales of the movie are extraordinary. The actors are getting better in their performance, and throwing in Bill Nighy made the movie just a bit better. Voldemort in my opinion is not terrific cinematic villain (He's no Darth Vader or Heath Ledger's Joker)he's at best a villain worthy of showtunery. Nevertheless I found this movie to be quite a treat. Note to others I was sleeping off and on. I am eagerly anticipating Deathly Hallows pt. 2.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|Simply put, the Academy did a great dis-service to themselves and to the people involved with Let Me In.  I know the film was quite similar to the original, but that doesn't mean that the movie is not good in its own right.  I think the two who most suffer without this recognition are the two lead actors.  Kodie Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz deserve to at least been in the running to be nominated for best actor/actress (even though they probably wouldn't have won).  Of all the movies I've seen this past year, these two by far out-acted everyone.  I think it's a credit to this movie that out of all the movies I've seen, this is the one that sticks out in my mind the most.  SEE IT!
0061777250|5.0|Please set aside any review(s) that belittle this book and make it out to be mere science fiction quackery. The holding on to long standing scientific theories is not what science defines itself as being. Defending scientific stances and tossing contradictions to these stances aside as being mere anomolies is nothing more than blatant ignorance and/or professional laziness. This book can be a revolutionary break through for all of humanity but, because science and religion have proved themselves to be very defensive of their long-standing positions, it will probably go unnoticed in both circles during our lifetimes. Hopefully many decades from now the theoreticians will look back on this writing and bemoan the fact that previous generations were so close-minded to the obvious truths about consciousness and ultimate reality. We have an ongoing history of many incidences of not seeing the forest because of the trees (i.e. Galileo and Einstein).<br /><br />The author, as myself, has spent timely parts of the past two decades NOT looking for the a fairy tale ending to our physical lives but, instead, have searched for an ultimate truth to our existence. While this concept may, indeed, go against the prevailing paradigms of the scientific community, it is one that not only draws from countless experiments and theoretical insights that have taken place, but draws heavily on our natural, common sense. If the Occam's Razor principal is correct, and it is yet to be proven false, the simplest reasoning for our existence and the process of consciousness is the inclusive theories that are put forth by this text. I heartily say \\"Bravo!\\" to the author for both the work that this text entailed but also for the razor sharp conclusions that he has reached. No, these theories may not ever be proven due to our living in a three dimensional world that relies on our limiting three dimensional measuring tools. But the multi-dimensional world of string theory does exist and the nonlocal consciousness can, and probably is, an intricate part of this phenomenon.<br /><br />Having had an NDE myself, I, as the other examples in this book, fully realize that the medical and scientific 'proofs' to these occurrences are either false or inadequate. An NDE is a REAL experience, an event that escapes descriptions because of our linguistic limitations and that, most importantly, life, as we have come to know it, is not the materialistic reality of the universe(s). We cannot, and should not, ignore the basics that quantum mechanics has brought to our attention over the past decades. Matter is brought into existence only through conscious observation and nonlocal consciousness (aka wave patterns) that uses the brain as a conduit for physical actions and emotional responses. This is the clearest picture of reality that has been presented to date. Nor should we ignore personal experiences simply because they cannot be fully measured under complete scientific standards. Thought, emotions, relationships and experiences cannot be fully weighed on a laboratory scale nor fully measured by a metric tool, but yet they are as real as the scientist himself.<br /><br />I, personally, want to thank the author for not only going against his reductionistic peers and risking his reputation in the process, but also in his stance against the dogmatic religionists who also fail to adjust their paradigms when presented with challenging counter-examples to their tenets. As the author states from an interviewed patient; \\"Dead is not dead.\\". I would like to add to this simplistic and revealing thought that \\"Life is not life in the way we presently view it either.\\" Keep your mind and your thoughts open to the possibilities of life and use today's popular opinions as stepping stones to further knowledge and not as anchors to our present and limited thoughts.ousness can, and probably is, an intricate part of this phenomenon.

B002OQYVJE|3.0|The religions overtones on the album (and most of Neal Morse's creative output since leaving Spocks Beard) killed it for me. I'm a major TA fan - *loved* Bridge Across Forever - but this one doesn't come close.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|I originally found this item while looking at some of the Xbox 360 to PS3 controller converters and mods available for sale. Almost all of these items had the same, common flaws: there were lag/response issues and huge dead zones -- both of which will ruin any good FPS. Enter: Pelican PS3 Dual Triggers.    I read all the positive reviews and figured for five bucks they were worth a try. While I am not here to argue which controller is superior between PS3 / Xbox, I will simply say I prefer the Xbox controller by far but almost anyone will agree that the triggers on PS3 controllers are too small to accurately grip. Well, this small accessory fixes that problem instantly.    While the end result still isn't quite as long of a trigger as the Xbox controller, it is plenty long enough and easy to grip. The Dual Triggers feel durable and are easy to install / take off with no lasting impact. I can also attest to the fact they stay in place very well. I have played several hundred games of COD: MW Black Ops and have not even had so much as a single issue with them slipping or falling off.    Overall, if you want longer, easier to grip triggers on your PS3 Dual Shock controller... BUY THESE NOW.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Being a Christina fan, you would think I'm being biased, but I was actually hesitant to go see this movie, based on all the bad reviews.  I got pulled into going to go see this movie & I was glad that I did.  The movie is really good.  I definitely recommend it to anyone that is willing to hear me out.  Christina is not the best actress, but not bad for a debut.  Overall the movie is AWESOME!  Christina is hot & of course can sing like no other!
B000GPIPT2|5.0|If you love a movie, which embodies and defines the word \\"Classic\\"..........you won 't be disappointed. I feel a person must have either an open mind to this story to be taken in, as dramatic and traumatic to the imagination or a love of the golden age of cinema.     This is one of Boris Karloff 's most defining career choices and the story written by Mary Shelley is well worth the price of admission, if it were released in the theater now. I understand, even more, the monster 's abandonment from it 's creator, the loneliness, the wanting to be equal and treated as such and most importantly.........playing God.     There are many qualities and emotions to touch a person (in my opinion) of feeling remorse, pity, sympathy, empathy and total sadness. If you ever are interested in knowing about the concept of what was once is dead is now alive? Watch this flick in all it 's historical significance!        MIG OUT.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|The CD I bought was in great shape. Very much like new. The CD case was a little broken but that's no big deal.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and I had no idea how fixated I became (and still am) on the phenomena of this realistic and thought provoking story. I had remembered when the limited series first hit the shelves at one of the comic book shops, where I was a frequent buyer and was interested in reading it. I never did, at the time. But, I quickly picked the graphic novel of all 12 issues and immediately was immersed into all the characters and sub-stories.     This is truly a defining moment, in a time, where this type of storytelling has not been matched in it 's raw, intellectual, realistic and pioneering in a long time or since. I understand the nature of the popularity to this series forever, now. I watched this movie a second time and was even more enthralled with it from start to finish! I own this Blu-Ray and I am very happy to state the transfer is completely acceptable and excellent to every detail. Zack Snyder took a chance and in my opinion..........he succeeded by including the \\"The Black Freighter!\\"        MIG OUT.
B000001GPX|5.0|While it should perhaps not be anyone's sole recordings of these two pinnacles of the history of music, Carlos Kleiber's Vienna virtually demonically possessed performances of Beethoven's fifth and seventh constitute what is arguably the greatest recording ever. In fact, the Vienna Philharmonic has probably never sounded crisper, more alert and more gloriously powerful than here. The orchestral playing is infinitely rich and resplendent, radiating almost divine glow and magnificence; all details are wonderfully articulated and sensitive and the dynamic range beggars belief. Kleiber's approach is relatively quick, but filled with tension and electrifying energy, wonderfully sweeping but still graceful and elegant. The fifth is rhythmically acute, urgent and full of fire and brimstone and contains a particularly exciting finale with a strong sense of inevitability (and as opposed to some of the classic accounts he does observe the exposition repeats) - but the whole work is perfectly judged and has to my knowledge never been as vibrantly vigorously executed. The seventh is equally full of verve and momentum (and just as gloriously played) - the main curiosity being his decision to play the last bars of the Allegretto pizzicato rather than arco, which to my ears works wonderfully well. The scherzo is blistering and the finale more stunningly powerful than one could possibly have dreamed possible. A staggering achievment, given to us in sound quality which is at least pretty good (a little dry, though); completely unmissable at any price.
