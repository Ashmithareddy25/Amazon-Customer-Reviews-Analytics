0385504209|3.0|A mix between \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\", \\"National Treasure\\" and Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\", Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is an exciting novel wrapped in intrigue, suspense, and controversy.<br /><br />To criticize the book for offering one dimensional characters, silly plot twists, and predictable discoveries about conniving figures who we thought were good-guys would be disingenuous on my part, since I particularly enjoy entertaining stories without much depth. Curator Jacques Sauniere is murdered in the Louvre, and professor Robert Langdon, innocent yet the primary suspect, and cryptologist/granddaughter of the victim Sophie Neveu go on a wild adventure running separately from the cops, the tall limping albino Opus Dei monk who really committed the murder, and the secret \\"Teacher\\" orchestrating the crime, while at the same time trying to figure out the mystery behind the hidden secret Sauniere was killed for. We find out that Sauniere was part of a secret society, the Priory of Sion, that has and protects the true identity and nature of the Holy Grail. The Albino monk is Silas, a member of spooky Catholic organization Opus Dei, working for his mentor Archbishop Aringarosa and the unknown Teacher, to seek out the Grail for ad majorem dei gloriam. French police chief Bezu Fache seems too religious, and arouses suspicion about his motives in pursuing Langdon. Luckily, Langdon knows Sir Leigh Teabing, a prominent Grail scholar eager to help in their search, in the hopes of revealing the \\"truth\\" of the Grail to a world that has been denied it by the \\"evil\\" Church. But, would Sauniere really have wanted the truth revealed?<br /><br />It would be simple if this work of fiction were really just a lighthearted work of fiction. However, Brown offers a disclosure stating that certain parts of the book are true. Yes, he is sure to point out that, while the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei exist, the main characters who are members are fictional, and while pointing out that descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals are true, he never makes any claims about the historical theories put forth by the characters. Yet, it is these claims by the characters that have excited the popular imagination and must be confronted.<br /><br />Both Langdon and Teabing refer anachronistically to \\"the Vatican\\" when criticizing past historical actions of the Church. Whether or not the claims made about the Church are true, it is incorrect to refer to the actions of \\"the Vatican\\" in the 15th century, much less the 3rd and 4th century. Vatican Hill, the location in Rome where St. Peter's Basilica and Vatican City are located, has only in the last few centuries been the seat of Church governance. Before then, the Pope's home base (and still the official Cathedral Church of the diocese of Rome) was the Cathedral of St. John Lateran in Rome. The 4th century, the era most derided in the book, the Pope was not in practical terms \\"in charge\\" of the Church, and East and West were still more than half a millennium from splitting. The Catholic Church as we know today, and Teabing loves to bash, was not around then. There was a Catholic Church, but it included both West and East, Latin and Greek, unlike today, where it is just Latin and few Eastern Rite Churches.<br /><br />Teabing and Langdon's major theses involve the idea that the Holy Grail is not the chalice of the Last Supper, but the blood line of the children of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, a 2000 year old secret that would shock the world. We learn in the book that the Priory of Sion heroically protects the secret by meeting and having \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" style orgies. But, why keep this fact a secret? Why not tell the whole world that Mary Magdalene and our homeboy JC got...it...on? Then we can all have orgies.<br /><br />Book claim: \\"Constantine made Jesus divine.\\" But you see, Teabing tells Sophie when Langdon and she seek refuge in his mansion, the Church has suppressed this truth. All the early Christian followers \\"knew\\" that Jesus was just a swell guy, descended from the royal blood of David who married Mary Magdalene of the royal line of Benjamin to make a super royal bloodline. But, Emperor Constantine ruined all the fun. He had the JC-MM marriage written out of the Bible, and decided to \\"make\\" Jesus divine at the Council of Nicea in 325, in what turned out to be a real close vote. Now, since Jesus is divine, no one can challenge the Christian religion of the Empire. A divine Jesus could not have a wife, so Mary Magdalene gets hush-hushed. From then on out, Christianity phased out the pagan practices of goddess worship, cut out the divine feminine, and the world started stinking.<br /><br />My rebuttal: Whether or not Jesus is divine is matter of faith. However, from a historical perspective, it is incorrect to claim that Constantine is the first to call Jesus divine. Since the time of Jesus, there have been many followers who have considered Jesus to be God, to be one with the Father. Yes, there also were followers, such as Arius, who placed Jesus as less than God, and the merits of the decision at Nicea is a much wider topic than a book review, but it is historically false to claim that there were not early Christians who believed in Christ's divinity. Also, the vote at Nicea was not close. It was an extreme majority that voted in favor of the Creed.<br /><br />Book claim: \\"Jesus married Mary Magdalene.\\" It is claimed by Teabing and Langdon that Jesus must have married Mary Magdalene because he loved her, references to kisses he gave her in apocrophal (non-canonical) gospels, and the \\"fact\\" that all Jewish men married then.<br /><br />My rebuttal: However, in reality there is solid evidence against the view that Jesus married. NOT all Jewish men married. There was always a place for asceticism in Judaism. The Dead Sea Scrolls, just discovered at Nag Hammadi in 1945, were not early Christian texts, as mentioned in the DaVinci Code, but rather Jewish religious texts written by the Essenes, one group among a number of Jewish celibate ascetics, the equivalent of later Christian monks. While most Jewish men married, it was not unheard of for some to remain celibate. And, since marriage was looked highly upon, and all the great Jewish leaders from the Old Testament were married and had their wives mentioned, the only reason not to mention a wife of Jesus was that he probably did not have one. After all, at this time, it would have made Jesus look better to have been married. The only reason not to mention it is it is not true.<br /><br />Book claim: \\"Sex is sacred.\\" We can see the true colors of the Priory of Sion, the defenders of the \\"truth\\" of the Grail, in Sophie's traumatizing experience that drove her from her grandfather. An orgy to show that sex is sacred? Actually, this is not a \\"new\\" idea. All of the ancient pagan religions believed that sex was divine, and many practiced ritualized sex. This is supposedly in contrast to the Church, which through the \\"fictional\\" story of Original Sin, has made sex dirty and shameful.<br /><br />My rebuttal: It is true that the Church does not consider sex to be divine. Unlike the straw-man that is set up to be torn down in the DaVinci Code, the Church also does not consider sex to be evil or dirty. Sex is a normal human activity. Not demonic or divine. It is good and a gift of God, but thoroughly human. And, frankly, whether one is someone who believes that sex is only for marriage or that sex is for any two (or more) consenting adults, I think we can all agree that it is kind of creepy and weird to call sex divine or sacred or religious. It does not cure cancer or make you fly or anything. It's sex. Even animals do it.<br /><br />Book claim: \\"No need to reveal the \\"truth\\" of the Holy Grail.\\" Let's pretend for a second that there really was a big cover up, and the Church has kept the Priory of Sion, under threat, from revealing the truth, and that is why they have to keep the bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalene a secret, only meeting once in awhile to perform some, um, rituals. Teabing is secretly the Teacher orchestrating the murder of Sauniere and seeking out the Grail because he thinks the \\"truth\\" that JC and MM married should be shouted from the rooftops. Langdon hedges, because Sauniere, the Grand Master leader of the Sion's, did not want it told, and, as Langdon says, \\"if you and I could dig up documentation that contradicted holy stories of...belief, should we do that?\\" After all, \\"those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metaphorical,\\" i.e. religious faith is based on fantasy, and it does not matter what one believes if it makes him feel good and he is nice to others. Plus, as we find out from Sophie's long lost grandmother who is not really dead like we earlier thought, the \\"truth\\" about Mary Magdalene and Jesus' marriage is found in art, historical objects, writings, phallic objects, and nature. Riiiiight. No reason to tell people the truth. We are the enlightened ones who have it.<br /><br />My rebuttal: Obviously, this is very patronizing. It conjures up images of the Grand Inquisitor who \\"knew\\" there was no God, but burned heretics to spare people the unbearable truth of a life without hope. If something is true, why not reveal it? And, the idea that the \\"important\\" truths are meant to be hidden and only known by the enlightened few is not Christianity, but Gnosticism. True Christianity is for everybody. Jesus did not come for just for the enlightened few. His message is for us all.<br /><br />If Jesus is just a man, and not divine, what is the point of worshipping him, or Mary Magdalene, or their \\"sacred\\" bloodline? The reason why Christians worship Jesus, and do not just revere him as a prophet like Moses or Muhammad, is because we believe him to be the God whose love is stronger than death, who offers us hope for new life after this one. And, far from disgracing Mary Magdalene's name, the Church honors her.

B000E33VWW|5.0|This is a great movie, but there are many many distracting instances of dirt and spots on the transfer. There is no excuse for this. The movie is less than a year old! Brilliant movie, but I was expecting it to look better. Maybe the studios should stop rushing these DVD releases and do them right the first time. Of course, that wouldn't leave much for the inevitable \\"super special deluxe edition\\" six months from now.
0670034711|5.0|In this day and age, we Americans live in a society where stress-filled days, long hours, and a mere two-week vacation are the norm in most corporate work environments. We work hard, we play even harder, and often we get burned out in the process. Therefore, it is no surprise that the dream of dropping everything to take time off to travel and \\"find one's self\\" is one of the most explored fantasies in the entertainment business. Also, it's no surprise that we number crunchers, penny pinchers, and wheel-grinders flock like lemmings to read, watch and consume whatever products make us feel like we actually have the ability to \\"escape\\" or outrun our day-to-day woes, if we put our minds to it. <br /> <br />The idea of going somewhere else to fix what's inside is quite characteristic of the overworked, frenetic culture of the West and certainly intriguing behavior to analyze --- it is ironic that we feel we must travel halfway around the globe away from our problems in order to gain enough perspective to face and potentially solve them. But this putting distance between ourselves and our troubles has been the subject of art for centuries. Where would we be without the constant search for clarity amidst our self-perpetuating chaos and the incessant impulse to interpret and describe what we learn along the way? <br /> <br />From National Book Award finalist Elizabeth Gilbert (THE LAST AMERICAN MAN) comes a travelogue so utterly pleasant and inspiring to read that many fellow soul-searchers undoubtedly will be scouring the Internet for vacation deals or weekend getaways the moment after they finish reading it. In a nutshell, EAT, PRAY, LOVE is Gilbert's contribution to the \\"distance begets understanding\\" canon --- a deeply personal chronicle of the year she spent living in three different countries (Italy, India and Indonesia) in order to better understand herself and her ultimate place in the universe. <br /> <br />As the book's flap copy so assiduously suggests and what she thankfully doesn't pretend to ignore, Gilbert led a fairly privileged life before her decision to drop-and-run. By the time she turned 30, she had a successful writing career as a reporter and published author (including a PEN/Hemingway nomination and the Pushcart Prize for her short story collection, PILGRIMS), a husband, a house in the suburbs and an apartment in New York City, a crew of worldly and influential friends, sufficient income to support her lifestyle, and a collection of stories from her own travels that definitely would be the envy of any Tom, Dick or Harry. From the outside, it appeared as though Gilbert had the perfect life. <br /> <br />But, as one might expect, she wasn't happy, and in a moment that can only be described as a bonafide breaking point (locked in the bathroom with her forehead on the floor tiles, sobbing uncontrollably), she realized she wanted out. She needed to find out what was missing from her life and how to get it back. As we all know, these things don't happen overnight. The breakup of her marriage left her emotionally and physically exhausted. The subsequent ill-fated affair she dove into directly after her divorce left her weak and dependent on a man who wasn't capable of giving her what she needed. It was around this time that she started to put the plan in motion that would take her away from these trappings and immerse her in three four-month-long rounds of intense self-discovery that would permanently alter the course of her life and, in turn, restore the missing links to her spiritual well-being. <br /> <br />In three separate sections, Gilbert attempts to tackle three different aspects of her personality while living in the country that best personifies that quality. In Italy (EAT), she explores the Pursuit of Pleasure and spends four glorious months eating, drinking and carousing her way through one of the most romantic, leisure-obsessed, pleasure-seeking cultures in the world. It is here that she remembers how toenjoy the taste of food without feeling guilty; how to revel in the joy that comes with sharing a bottle of wine in the moonlight while conversing in a foreign tongue; and how to float through her days with only the purpose of enjoying the fullness of her life from moment-to-moment. <br /> <br />In India (PRAY), she studies the Pursuit of Devotion and spends four strenuous months living on the ashram of a guru she met in the States. Here, she is taught that humility, patience and perseverance are essential in obtaining the spiritual guidance she so desires and that enlightenment can only be achieved through sincere dedication and focused discipline. In this quiet, almost austere environment, we witness Gilbert at her most humble --- fighting her insecurities and the demons from her past with a fierce intensity that only the most committed possess. <br /> <br />Her last four months in Indonesia (LOVE) are devoted to the Pursuit of Balance. It is in Bali that she finally brings her year-long sojourn to a close and, while doing so, achieves the balance she so lacked in the beginning. While living alone in a house in the hills, she furthers her spiritual study by apprenticing a ninth-generation medicine man, breaks her year-long vow of celibacy, and unexpectedly falls in love with a 52-year-old Brazilian man. In her words, \\"I was not rescued by a prince; I was the administrator of my own rescue.\\" <br /> <br />There are far too many invaluable insights in this gem of a book to mention and far too little space to describe the impact that EAT, PRAY, LOVE most certainly will have on the lives of its readers. Suffice to say that Elizabeth Gilbert has a gift for storytelling and a knack for making us feel like we are welcome passengers on her journey. She is wise beyond her years, genuine in her approach, and steadfast in her attention to what really matters in life. Gratifying, thought-provoking --- a book you can take with you throughout your own march towards fulfillment.<br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Alexis Burling
B00005JOUM|4.0|It is a long standing Hollywood tradition that inspired, quality directors take on \\"for hire\\" projects in order to be able to make films that are closer to their hearts. Recent examples include Steven Soderbergh and the \\"Oceans 11-12\\" films, F.F. Coppola and \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" and the \\"Rainmaker\\" as well as Spike Lee  and \\"25 Hours.\\"<br /><br />Results have been mostly good (\\"BS Dracula) and not so good (\\"25 Hours\\"). But nonetheless, quality directors, despite the material, always elevate it by way of their personal point of view and sterling story-telling techniques.<br /><br />Spike Lee, director of the sublime \\"Malcolm X\\" directs this film, \\"Inside Man,\\" basically a bank heist film, and elevates it to, if not Art, then to a mostly exciting, well crafted thriller with terrific performances by the always reliable Denzel as NYC Hostage Negotiator, Keith Frazier and Clive Owen as Bank Robber, Dalton Russell. The only problematic performance comes from the luminous Jodie Foster as a kind of go to woman who has friends in high places, whose actual profession is murky but who is very well paid for her service. The problem is her role is not well thought out and written and though Foster cannot help but have her special moments, she cannot get her arms and remarkable talent around this role.<br /><br />Directing from a good script by Russell Gewirtz, \\"Inside Man\\" is a fun, interesting, well-made popular entertainment that almost always keeps your mind and eyes interested.
047119350X|2.0|I have finished a 2 semester course in biochemistry which had focused on both biopolymer chemistry and metabolism, as well as fundamentals of biotechnology (i.e. cloning and expression studies). <br />From the early days we were prescribed Voet, and it was a textbook that most often made students cringe and complain. The fundamental reasons for it doing so was attributed to its pedantic style, uneasy writing, disoriented explanations and verbose nature. It requires that you actually start reading it prior to the semester, since the length and depth of chapters is too much to handle; this is not due to the information itself. Biochemistry is relatively easy, but the book does not give clear explanations and often randomly jumps into unwelcome depths prior to establishing an overall context of the subject matter. <br />The chapter on DNA metabolism is a very good example, it starts off giving a history lesson about how radiography and other exploratory studies (nowadays these techniques arent implemented) were conducted and proceeds into the domains, motifs and archetypes of DNA polymerase without first establishing the biological purpose of replication, how it differs in the eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the fundamental \\"machinery\\" involved in replication and how the processes occurs (as an overview). So now from this stupid history lesson we jump into the structure and function of various different protein units....no mention of sequence or relevance.  <br />Its hard as it is doing four units of different subjects, I was lucky enough to primarily be doing all chemistry units for the first semester. I still suffered. I mean the length and depth of this book is not suited to a struggling undergraduate student, who has to cover a variety of other subjects. When it came to the exams, revision was almost impossible with this book. I had to rely on my own hand written notes. <br />I am principally an organic chemist and I have to say that the authors really got me lost evenin the sections pertaining to a structural and mechanistic explanation of metabolic elements. I think it was due to lack of experience of the authors in these fields, in conjunction with a desire to present a sophisticated discussion of glycolysis and gluconeogensis. <br /> <br />They dont even explain WHY plants and animals store glucose as starch and glycogen respectively. Nothing about osmolarity and concentration gradients. These two (hubby and wife) claim to give a robust understanding of the fundamental workings of biochemistry. However all they provide is unnecessary, superfluous information which if I did actually even seek, I would look at journal articles rather than an undergraduate textbook. Meaning that no university on earth expects 1st and 2nd year biochemistry majors to even know a lot of that junk, so why bother presenting it? <br /> <br />We dont care about which genes encode each polymeraze. At most we may care about how they differ in their active sites, possibly in their subunit structure and how they actually process DNA. <br /> <br /> <br />Garrett and Grisham are significantly better than this book for undergrads.
B000DWMYQ8|3.0|I love Walt Disney movies.  So when Chicken Little came out my family and I jumped at it.  And when it was over and we left the theater, there were two responses.<br /><br />The first was from my 2 year old:  He liked it, but then he likes all these kinds of movies.<br /><br />The second was from every adult that came out:  It was OK, but I really expected more from Disney.<br /><br />I mean this is the movie that caused Disney company to completly get rid of their classicly drawn animation department.  This was the movie that gave Disney the confidence at that time to say, \\"We don't need Pixar, we can do this all by ourselves.\\"  So with all that I expected a GREAT Movie, and all we got was an OK movie.<br /><br />It wasn't bad, I mean the story was alright, the animation was very well done, some of the characters were very funny, the voices were \\"A\\" list actors, (Don Knotts played the mayor), yet it just didn't hit the high expectations that everyone including myself had set for a \\"Disney\\" movie\\".  And while some ,may say well you set your expectations to high.  Well, I don't think so, as I already said, this was to be the movie that would show pixar that we didn't need them, this was going to be the movie that ushered in a whole new way of making Disney animation, and this is what we got.  If that was the standard that Disney set, it failed miserably.  Because the movie was just OK.<br /><br />And for those that say, \\"OH, I would give it 5 stars!\\"  Really, so you would say that this movie is as good as any Pixar movie produced so far?  You would say that this movie is as good as \\"The Lion King\\" or \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", or \\"Peter Pan\\"?  I don't think so.<br /><br />And evidently Disney agreed because you notice after they made this movie, and it only got luke-warm reviews, then they up and buy Pixar, why?  Maybe they knew the movie was just OK too.<br /><br />Here's the deal, if you want to have every movie Disney ever made pick this one up.  If you want  a new movie for your kids because they will watch anything animated, then go ahead and pick it up.<br /><br />But if you want some quality animated Disney, then it's best for you to pick up the oldies, or a pixar flick, because they got it right.you want  a new movie for your kids because they will watch anything animated, then go ahead and pick it up. <br /> <br />But if you want some quality animated Disney, then it's best for you to pick up the oldies, or a pixar flick, because they got it right.

B00005KHJM|5.0|So raw and unconventional, yet quite straightforward, this movie is creepy as hell!!  Even in the original, unless you purchase a rarer edition of this original movie with all of the uncut scenes, there is pantomime which may seem kind of random.  I'd never seen the uncut version, but other comments and the DVD commentary say that all the pantomime have meaning and many more intricacies would have been explained or elaborated on.  With all the cuts, much of the substance was taken out.  Not so much to take away from the main centerpiece, otherwise there'd be no movie.<br /><br />It's such a standout that they are remaking it this year.  This is NOT your usual hokey religious movie, even though it may seem that way.  If any, it criticizes irregular beliefs to the extreme.  When you see most of the movie, all you may think is Indian tribes and religion.  It will all come together when you watch the entire movie though, or should I say apart?  You can only watch to find out how effective one police officer can be on an island.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I remember seeing this as a child in the theatre and being both afraid and facinated. I could see this being a great kids movie that actually stands up to adulthood. Some might be horrified at the prospect of a distroyed yellow brick road and emerald city. But this film stretches the imagination even more so than the original. You can't really compare this with the original Wizard, but it stands up on its own great. Worth checking out.
B0002858YS|4.0|When I first got this record I really only liked Somebody Told Me, then I saw the video for Mr. Brightside and was completely in love with the song(it still never gets old, especially when played while driving at night). <br />One thing to note about this record, it can be hard to get into, because the songs are very different, they each have their own hook(and yes, they do ALL have a hook) that once you get into, you'll love the song - for instance Andy You're A Star has the part where it ALMOST reaches the release when he first sings \\"Andy you're a star...\\" and then the next time he reaches it and you just rock out to it.... <br />If you love music with a hook, and a different perspective on sadness, then I would highly recommend this record, it's one of the best albums I ever acquired, and with it only being around $10, now, it's definitely worth picking up. <br />Peace.
0393327655|3.0|The End of Faith is a book with one excellent idea -- that religious ideas should not be exempt from criticism in public discourse -- and a lot of filler that could have flowed from the pen of just about any anti-religion propagandist. <br /> <br />I agree with a lot of what author Sam Harris has to say about the potential dangers of religion, and the danger of ignoring the fact that religion is the source of a lot of the social problems presently being blamed on everything else (e.g., politics, economics, culture, demographics, Western foreign policy).  Yeah, other factors are important, but religion is the elephant in the room: anyone who thinks that's the one cultural force that has nothing to do with how people conduct themselves has got another think coming.  We're never going to solve all our problems unless we can discuss all their causes. <br /> <br />But we're going to have to discuss them better than Harris does.  His reasoning is often facile: in one instance he parries the objection \\"Why can't we be religious if it makes us feel better\\" by claiming that would contradict the meaning of the ancient Greek root for the word \\"because;\\" another time he makes the claim that dangerous secular social movements (like Communism and Nazism) are religions in the important ways, which circularizes his arguments: religion is wrong, Communism is wrong, therefore Communism is a religion.  And he has the arrogance, as an atheist, to tell the religious when they're practicing their religions correctly.  To the extent you're not doing everything your holy book tells you -- even the parts that contradict the other parts -- as far as Harris is concerned, that's the extent to which you're being an atheist.  It's bad enough to have the religious telling that to each other without atheists insisting on it too. <br /> <br />The End of Faith is highly readable, and apparently Harris's provocative language caught the public attention in ways that more reasonable runs at similar material have yet to do.  I guess it's nice that he's getting this point of view to a wide audience.  Half the battle is getting the topic into public discourse in the first place, and Harris seems to be accomplishing that.  I wish he'd paid more attention to the other half, though, and had something better to say once the topic was out there.
B000EMG9EU|5.0|This is recording that is well grounded in eighties pop culture, yet still sounds avant-garde. The Album is full of Sonic Youth's trademark feedback-drenched explosions of noise and beat-inspired poetry, yet this is unlike any other SY recording. Not only do most of the songs involve a beatbox and samples, there are even Madonna and Robert Palmer covers!<br /><br />Humor and irreverence combines with an anything-goes approach the song structures. It sounds like the band is having a lot of fun, and that energy passes to the listener. An added bonus is the guest appearances of Mike Watt and J.

On the big screen, \\"lame\\" also comes into play. Many of the original Broadway cast members are reunited for this gritty, noisy excursion into an underbelly that has gone belly up.
1400062756|5.0|If you are a parent, teacher, student, coach, employer, employee, looking for a job, or in a relationship (did I leave anyone out?) you have to read this book.  As a parent, I truly believe this book should be mandatory reading for any teacher, education major, or coach, because it made me realize that the feedback our children are given from teachers and coaches can have a harmful or beneficial impact on them for the rest of their lives (unless they read this book later in life and decide to change their mindset).  Teachers need to realize how what they say, even if it appears positive, can stunt the intellectual, emotional, and even the creative growth of a child or student of any age.  This book showed me how certain things I may say to my children to praise them, actually may hurt their continued growth--and it taught me a better way to give praise. This book is very helpful in teaching a person what to focus on when giving praise or criticism, whether to a student, son or daughter, employee, etc.    As a business owner, I hope I can take what I learned from this book and not only use it to help my business grow, but also help my employees grow by helping them achieve a \\"growth mindset\\".  As a parent, I hope to help cultivate my children into \\"growth mindset\\" oriented individuals, and as a wife, this book will help my relationship continue to grow.    Once you start reading it, you won't want to put it down.  It would make a great teacher's gift-but give it to them at the beginning of the year, so that your child will benefit from their newfound knowledge!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|*What is there to say about Rent? What words can be used? How about dynamic? Amazing? Masterpiece? I think those and others would be feasible. This movie adaption of Jonathan Larson's 1996 Pulitzer Prize Award-winning musical is nothing short of wonderful. It shows the ties that bind a friendship between eight people living in Bohemian New York \\"at the end of the millenium\\". Larson was a genius and provided musical numbers that touch both the heart and the mind, as well as the spirit. The lyrics are flowing and the music itself is show-stopping.     *One other thing I'd like to point out: According to a certain reviewer named \\"Kommisar\\", this movie is gay. Wow. What a profound statement. And according to his  friends, if you're a guy, and you like Rent, then you're gay. I happen to be straight, and Rent is my favorite musical of all time, and the movie is way up there on my list as well. So, I believe I just punched a minor hole in this adolescent's statement. These asinine friends of his need to give some backup as to why they hate this. It makes me angry when I see someone say crap like that, but give nothing else. \\"This movie sucks\\" is not a review. It's a desperate cry for attention.    *I highly recommend this movie to pretty much anyone who is a fan of Broadway shows. Again, Jonathan Larson (book writer, musical composer, and lyricist for Rent) was a genius, and had his life not been tragically cut short, I bet we would have seen more great works come from him. As for the film adaption of the sstage version? It was done well. The actors get through to the audience, and stunning performances are given by Anthony Rapp and Roger Davis, as well as others. The movie is supposed to stick to the storyline of the rock opera itself as much as possible, and Columbus achieved this feat. It was a big transition, but with as big as a following as Rent has had, one of the points Columbus had to and did make was the maintaining of the original plotline. This movie achieves amessage that all of us can use in our everyday life: Friendship is a thing to be valued, and never taken for granted...friends will be there for you, through thick and thin.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|Rent is a blast! The whole movie is probably 90% all song, and when there is dialogue, it is only to set up the next scene or musical number. The songs, by the way, are not that bad. They're mostly sung dialogue which works, because there's something about singing out words that make the dialogue come to life and feel more personal. <br />  <br />Acting wise, everyone played their parts well and it's no surprise that everyone would be doing a great job as these actors were the same performers that did the play back in the early 90's. So of course, with frequent performances, the actors know these charcters inside and out. The only newcomers were Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms, who both do an excellent job of blending in with the original cast and not to mention vocal talents as well. <br /> <br />Musical highlights have to be \\"Out Tonight\\", \\"I'll Cover You\\", \\"I'll Cover You (Reprise)\\", \\"Take Me or Leave Me\\", \\"I Should Tell You\\" not to mention \\"La Vie Boheme\\" and \\"Finale B\\". <br /> <br />The film is about 2 hours and 13 minutes long and for someone who might not be into musicals, this might be a tough film to sit through because by the 1 hour and 15 minute mark, you will be exhausted with how many musical numbers were already performed and how many more there is to go! But for someone who is used to song and dance, this shouldn't be a problem. The charcters and situations are easy to understand and engaging that it won't bore fans. <br />  <br />Watching Rent, I truly believe that this is one rock opera of a movie that somewhat felt epic in terms of its noumerous amount of musical numbers, the one year time span of the film and of how the scenes were shot. Again lots of wide sweeping shots that just make the movie that much bigger and \\"epic\\" like. <br />  <br />Anyways, go check it out and see if it works for you!
B00005JNNZ|3.0|Based on the true life story of a high school basketball coach in Richmond, California who wants his players to do better in life and on the basketball court.  So muc so, that he bans his players from playing until their grades get better.  It's a decision much to the chagrin of the parents and school board.  The movie I felt tries too hard to tell the story and almost loses its punch. But with Samuel L. Jackson contining his great round of performances, as usual as the title role the film still is worthy of praise.  Great for all kids 13 and up as they can use a lesson on priorities.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I came across this series by accident and rented the first disc not expecting much.  I was very, very surprised at the quality of this series.  The acting from all the players is excellent.  The photography stunning.  And the various threads are all interesting and well done.  I have now watched all 6 discs of the first season and the quality did not deteriorate over the entire first season.<br /><br />My only disappointment was that when I went looking for the second season, it wasn't available.  Apparently, WB hasn't put out any but the first season.  What are they waiting for???
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|Let me say this from the begining, kids will love this film.  They'll enjoy the cute and cuddly chick who wants to be loved and appreciated.  However, some people will be perplexed by the storyline.  I felt the premise of the story was too long.  There's only so much you can do with a small story and it showed with the inclusion of space aliens.  I also wasn't impressed by a few characters.  One character I realy was annoyed at was the pig.  I felt he was out of place and not funny at all.  Despite the shortcomings, your kids will enjoy the film, adults will be disappointed.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This is one of those CD's that gets better with repeat listening. I have a long commute to and from work. And, I must say That I really like this one. David Gilmour's fantastic guitar work and his wife Polly's lyrics bring on a new dimention to his solo work! Of his three releases, I like this one the best. All the tracks are good. But, \\"THE BLUE\\" is my personal favorite. A smooth flowing song with incredible guitar! David Gilmour music has matured since the last solo release. And I for one am liking it! I don't understand some of the negative reviews I've read. Is there really still people out there that think Pink Floyd will get back together and take up where they left off. (That is before Roger Waters left.) Oh Please! Just enjoy the music people. Times change and so do people and situations. Yes, David Gilmour's new CD is on the mello side But, that's a good thing!
B000AARKOO|3.0|It's definitely eye candy, with spectacular scenes of massed armies and trebuchets hurling fireballs. Unfortunately, it's also \\"jolt\\" filmmaking at its worst. As in Gladiator, everything is pumped up to the same level of intensity, through the use of quick camera cuts, exaggerated sound effects (I'm really getting to hate that \\"whoosh\\" that accompanies every sword swing in movies), reverb added to every bit of dialog to make the actors sound more convincing, plenty of gore, and constant music with lots of deep rumbling. When you take all this away, you have two or three decent performances, some lovely costumes, and a reasonably accurate sketch of the events leading up to the Third Crusade.     As for the leading characters, the actors are not given much to work with: our hero mostly just struts around being handsome and knowledgeable, while Queen Sibylla, looking very goth, stares glumly wide-eyed at everything around her. The only character who really engages us, other than Bailin's father (Liam Neeson), is Saladin (Ghassan Massoud), bristling with strength and authority.     I can't say I hated this movie as much as Gladiator. It's at least more coherent, and some attempt is made to let us know just what's going on in the battle scenes. Nonetheless it is far too reliant on cheap effects, and pays far too little attention to characterization, to be a great film.
1580086810|5.0|Peter Menzel long ago realized that people all over the world don't know enough about each other! In Material World, he showed the material possessions of families from Mali to Japan and the incredible disparity of their THINGS, yet he emphasizes the humanity of everybody and shows that obviously possessions are not of utmost importance. HUNGRY PLANET (and his wonderful Man-Eating BUGS book) show how the rest of the world eats, how some folks can survive healthily on far less food than others--and end up with less diabetes, heart disease, etc. Another important aspect is that he and Faith and the photographers give money and help back to the children and families they photograph! Bravo, you guys!!!!!!! Great presents for adults and kids of all ages--something for everybody.
B000002N3J|5.0|Yes. Yeeees !. This one has the most, when it comes to a touch of genius when it  comes to ballad singin/song writing. The weakest one are the \\"new songs\\" on this 1995 CD. Track 1 I want you (with Massive Attack) sure sparks quality, but that comes from Madonna`s voice and not from Massive Attacks musical work. Too much musical \\"attack\\" in a way. Track 2 I`ll remember, we are back in buisness again, which shows quality Madonna all over, with a voice from \\"heaven above\\". Like angel dust  balsam you ears in a way. Track 3 Take a bow, with it`s eastern/japanese begining it`s a ballad which glimmers shiny and bright all trough. A very soul uplifting song this one. A ballad with a big B. Track 4 You`ll see is one of the better \\"new\\" songs on this CD, but the x-factor to lift it up above average missing. Track 5. Crazy for you. Is a Madonna classic from here early classical period. A gem back then, and ok listen nowaydays too. Track 6 This used to be my playground, has everything included if you wanna find a hit song that delivers in every department. Very cool, very relaxable, and very Madonna. And that`s a quality trademark for sure. Track 7 Live to tell, has much of the same trademarks, and it`s from the classical Madonna period, which shows Madonna with her \\"masters voice\\" brings glory on every note she sings. Track 8 Love don`t live here anymore (Remix) has a wide open soundpicture, and angel strings/syntheseisers blippin` up here and there, and makes this a minor gem all trough.<br /><br />Track 9 Something to remember is a minor let down. It`s to ordinary in a way, but the singing is great though. Track 10 Forbidden love, is more in the nightclub whisperin` country. It`s soulfull and has a spirit of greatness here and there,but that`s all folks. Track 11 One More chance, it`s the best one of the \\"new ones\\". An acoustic interesting song, but it`s very simpel. To simpel, and not speaks out glory. Track 12 Rain, as an  inspired opening , and soon changes into, sorry to say lesser inspired middel and the end. But there is something there. Track 13 Oh Father, is a simpel ballad. To simpel, and rather forgetable when it come`s to the end. Too much earcandy in a way. Track 14 I want you ( here we go again with Massive Attack (Orchestral version) Nuff said already, because this is the same song as the first one. Anyway greatness shines on this ballad hits collection, of one of the realy mega artists in pop heaven which always delivers.lesser inspired middel and the end. But there is something there.

B00008BXJJ|4.0|This album hasn't been recieved well in ANY circle; critics despise it, fans overlook it. The CD has fared best amongst the uninitiated, which was me back in 1992. My first three CD's were purchased at almost the same time: Metallica's \\"Black Album,\\" Aerosmith's \\"Get a Grip,\\" and AC/DC's \\"Live.\\" I still love all those albums. It puzzles me that \\"Live\\" gets very little respect considering the high quality of the band's material. \\"Thunderstruck\\" is better live than on the \\"Razor's Edge.\\" \\"Who Made Who\\" live is a total classic. \\"TNT\\" is very different from Bon's version, but not inferior. Sure, the \\"Back in Black\\" material is not as good as the original stuff, but the same is not true for the mid-80's-through-1990 songs.  <br /> <br />Perhaps everyone is partial to the first incantation they remember from the band. A good majority of the fans, swear by Bon Scott's 70s version of AC/DC (something I've never been partial to). Many prefer Brian Johnson's 80s band. And both of those camps tend to ridicule the post 1991 stuff, myself included. After this album there was the Last Action Hero Soundtrack and a couple albums with three-star material at best. Then again, if that were true, \\"Live\\" captures AC/DC at the end of their stride, not their peak. Ahh, for me none of that matters. I think we're all fond of the first album we ever hear by a band, and this was mine for AC/DC. This is how I remember them.  <br /> <br />Overall: 8 out of 10. <br />
0140277447|5.0|The late Iris Chang (sadly, overcome with depression, she killed herself in 2004) has crafted an excellent, but disturbing account of one of WWII's most horrific atrocities.  The Rape of Nanking is written in an easy to read, non-academic style, making it accessible to all types of readers.  Chang writes of numerous incidents of Japanese barbarity that occurred when the Japanese captured the city of Nanking in 1937.  Repeatedly, the reader is bombarded with stories of rape, murder and outright excesses of violence, condoned at the highest levels of command.  These do become repetitive but this only reinforces the horror of the situation, of men and women trying to keep their families together and to stay alive and out of the clutches of the Japanese.<br /><br />But it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the The Rape of Nanking isn't just about the atrocities - that Chang is able to tell the story at all is because of a small band of people, who risked their lives to help as many of the fleeing Chinese as possible.  The British, Americans and Germans living in Nanking established a safe zone for Chinese refugees, and to help as many as they could.  It is thanks to the records they left behind, that this horrific event is able to be told.  The book is illustrated with a selection of black and white photographs, many of which only reinforces the sense of this tragic and disturbing atrocity.  It should be noted that many of the images are disturbing and gruesome.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no separate bibliography although Chang does include a notes section which indicates her source material.  She has relied on a number of sources, mainly westerners who wrote diaries and letters (there were a number of British, Americans, and Germans present in Nanking at the time - John Rabe, the Nazi who was \\"The Good German\\", even wrote a report to Adolf Hitler).  Other sources of information were German diplomatic records and US Naval Intelligence records.  She interviewed a number of Chinese survivors for their accounts, and also located Japanese sources for their side of the story - disturbingly at one point Chang discusses Japanese newspaper coverage of a race between two Japanese officers to kill as many Chinese as possible.  I happen to have a copy of the book \\"Documents of the Nanking Safety Zone\\" which Chang references on a number of occasions in the notes section of her book, and it lists over 400 events of rapes, murders and other acts of violence prepetrated by Japanese soldiers, a number of which were verified by witnesses including a Reverend in Nanking at the time of the events, Rev. Magee, and John Rabe.<br /><br />From the number of reviews for this book, it is quite apparent that \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" is one of the more controversial books around.  The main reason for this being the heated denials from the pro-Japanese faction that the events as portrayed in the book ever occurred.  However, despite their best efforts to convince people otherwise, it is clearly obvious to anyone troubling to inform themselves of both sides of the argument, that a massacre of some proportions occured in Nanking.  To my mind, there is just too much independent evidence to suggest anything but a massacre, whether it was 300000 people slaughtered or 200000. The Japanese denials come across as being factually inaccurate and baseless, and lack any sort of credibility given the Japanese government's position on a number of issue's arising out of their conduct in WWII including the treatment of POWs, comfort women, and the revisionist teachings in Japanese school's of Japanese actions in WWII.  It is a tragedy that many young Japanese are unlikely to learn the extent of what their country did 70 years ago, in stark contrast to the youth of today's Germany, who are well aware of what their country and citizens did in WWII.  However, just as I do not judge Germans today on what their grand parents generation did, nor do I judge the Japanese of today on what their countrymen did some 70 years ago.  The Rape of Nanking is an account of a tragic event that all people, regardless of nationality should be aware of.  If everyone was aware of this tragedy, then maybe such an atrocity will never be allowed to perpetuated again.apanese of today on what their countrymen did some 70 years ago.

074322454X|4.0|I have to admit I haven't seen the miniseries, so this review is based only on the book.  I found it difficult to get into the book; but once I did, I couldn't put it down.  The writing is simple yet extremely powerful.  The story of the Soldiers in Easy company is truely amazing.  It is just hard to imagine what how difficult it was to go through everything.  This book is an excellent, fast read.
B000002H2H|5.0|before write this, i was reading the reviews of ST. ANGER... and i've found basically 2 kinds of reviews: 0 stars (the ones who knows METALLICA from years before) and 5 stars (some people that i don't understand why they voted that way :P ). <br /> <br />...and its average is 3 stars. <br /> <br />then I came and I found something with which I agree, RIDE THE LIGHTNING has an average of 5. is easy to know why: excellent compositions, good playing, good lyrics, good production, not bad art (but what i like is the music, for art i got to a museum)... and compared whit ST. ANGER, RTL is better... <br /> <br />...but why? the musicians have two ways generally; or they do the sam thing again and again (like AC-DC), or they progress and change continuously (like DREAM THEATER)... but in both, they grow like musicians. and after some records, they have more control over the music that they are doing. <br /> <br />then, what i have to think? is ride the lightning so good because DAVE MUSTAINE was still involved? i dont think so. is so good because CLIFF BURTON played on it? who knows... is so good because they did not have money but they have hunger for glory? probably. <br /> <br />of course, i gave 5 starts, but as i said before in another review: i dont like to write about older CDs... but in this case, this CD resists the passage of time (however, ST. ANGER I do not believe that it lasts much more). <br /> <br />in my opinion <br />1983-1990 METALLICA (the best albums) <br />1991-1996 METALLIGLAM ('black' and 'load') <br />1997-2000 MONEYTALLICA ('reload', 'garage' and 's&m') <br />2001-2006 FATALLICA <br /> <br />pd- thanks to babelfish translator for help me with my translation (I can read perfect, but when I want to write my problems with the verbs begin...)

B000099T2L|5.0|After the devastating departure from long time friends and band mates (Letoya Luckett and Latavia Roberson), the menacing backlash from fickle-fans, the constant scrutiny and interminable rumors from the media (pregnancy, obesity, plastic surgery, an on-stage body double named Sasha), interventions into her personal/love life, malicious reviews from critics and media spectators, and endless meddling with her family's affairs and issues....Beyonce' Gisele Knowles proves that no matter what is thrown at us in our daily lives, mind over matter (and endless hours of sleep) can lead to triumph over any tribulations<br /><br />This woman is by far, a true pioneer in her own sense and even after only 7 years of her career as entertainer, Beyonce' can be reasoned to be a living legend.

B000067J24|4.0|WOMAN ON TOP is one of those films that was made, publicized and viewed as pastiche and because of its honesty as a simple romantic comedy, it rates higher than many of the over the top and overproduced competitors.  The film is colorful, filled with wonderful Bossa Nova music, and has enough eye candy to almost make you forget the main dishes!<br /><br />Isabella Oliveira (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) lives in Bahia, Brazil totally in love with Toninho Oliveira (Murilo Ben&iacute;cio) where the two have a restaurant featuring Isabella's passionate cooking  and Toninho's macho front man role.  Isabella has a problem: motion sickness - she cannot fly, ride in a car, or assume the bottom position during sex or she becomes violently ill (it seems that the sea goddess compensated her problem by making her an inimitable chef). All is well until Toninho has a brief affair that drives the crushed Isabella to move to San Francisco alone despite her love for Toninho.  There she moves in with her old friend Monica from Bahia (Harold Perrineau as a superbly enacted crossed dressed drag queen) and begins her unsuccessful search for a job.  In order to overcome her longing for Toninho and regain her culinary skills she makes a pact with the sea goddess, forsaking ever loving Toninho again. Eventually Isabella lands a TV show on Passionate Cooking when desperate producer Cliff (Mark Feuerstein) gets a whiff of her talent. She is an immediate success. Meanwhile Toninho, unable to endure life in Bahia without Isabella, flies to San Francisco and begins a series of Bossa Nova serenades to win her back.  Cliff places Toninho on Isabella's show as background music and the ratings soar.  But it is the ultimately the conflict resolution between Isabella and Toninho that brings the story to its expected end.<br /><br />The story may be light and the script may be pedestrian, but the direction and camera work suffuse this film with Latin American magical realism and that keeps it lighthearted and fun.  Cruz is terrific, Perrineau is the true star of the show displaying a sophisticated and sensitive acting skill that is very special, and Murilo Ben&iacute;cio is not only a hunk and eye candy but also a fine singer and a warm actor who deserves a lot of attention. Story three, stars four.  Have fun with this one!

B000AA305M|4.0|David Gray has toned down the rockier side of his sound since his early work (e.g. \\"Sell, Sell, Sell\\"), but the electronica merged with what is essentially folk-pop music is most welcome on \\"Life In Slow Motion.\\" The album's first cut, \\"Alibi\\" emerges from the depths of heartache and loss. Other tracks, such as \\"The One I Love\\" and \\"Hospital Food\\" have great hooks in the way that is reminiscent of classics like \\"Babylon\\" and \\"Sail Away. Lyrically, this album is a return to Gray's poetic form, particularly on \\"Lately\\" and \\"From Here You Can Almost See the Sea.\\"
B000002OX7|5.0|i think Wont Get Fooled Again is one of hard rocks greatest songs. I LOVE THE PART WHERE ROGER DALTREY DOES A BIG SCREAM. <br />It makes me play it over and over and over again. Other good songs are classics BABA O RILEY, & BARGAIN...Classic album.
B000022TSY|5.0|\\"Get your motor runnin'. . . . \\" was more than the opening theme song of this the creation of two then little known counter culturalists, Hopper and Fonda, and their sidekick Nicholson. You have to remember when this was created, the summer of 1969 to 1970, we were faced with all sorts of stains on the theme of America, or as Codeleesa Rice once quipped, America with 'its birth defects.'<br /><br />Captain America and Billy score big in a drug sale and take us on a tour of America, heading for Mardi Gras. Along the way they hit the highs and lows of the then American Dream. In a time only a few years after the murder of the Civil Rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi, Brown versus The Board of Education, and still dual drinking fountains, Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper) try to get served in the South, pick up Nicholson, smoke a lot of herb, and eventually are crushed by their dream. It's a poetic piece which meant a lot to us when we saw it. Regrettably, there were wrongs with that America and Fonda and Hopper were subtle enough to point some of them out without being too heavy handed. They let us see the South they saw and listen to the rather haunting words of Nicholson.<br /><br />The picture has now become a milestone for low budget producers saying sopmething worthwhile. See Crash; See 11:14.<br /><br />The movie has its flaws but not in it's spirit. And a damn good sound track to boot.  \\". . . . . and get out on the highway.\\" 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I think this is a really great album by one of the greatest groups in rock history, GUNS N' ROSES. This is a classic and contains great songs like SWEET CHILD o' MINE, Civil WAR, & NOVEMBER RAIN. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETE if MR. BROWNSTONE, or ROCKET QUEEN was on here. Anyway, this CD is one that every rock fan must OWN! GO PURCHASE 1 TODAY WITH APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION. <br />
B000E8LQOC|4.0|The latest production of Sylvia Plath's classic novel, the Bell<br /><br />Jar (seven hours, seven CDs, unabridged, Caedmon audio/Harper<br /><br />audio) is amazing piece of audio literature.<br /><br />Most of the previous productions have been abridged or overdone . . . and this unabridged version is better than the other versions I have heard. When  the original book was written . . .  depression was hinted about . . .  suicide was swept under the rug  . . . mental breakdowns were whispered behind closed doors and never spoken aloud.<br /><br />Actress and first time narrator  Maggie Gyllenhaal<br /><br />takes this book `s text and wins out the listener slowly, as the<br /><br />book progresses. She starts out her narrative very  natively and<br /><br />transcends into madness. She  takes the listener with her<br /><br />through her stages of insaneness of the character's mind set.<br /><br />Her vocal mental illness sound almost real, surreal in some<br /><br />parts. The character of Esther Greenwood, a thinly veiled<br /><br />version of Plath herself, is fully brought out under the hands<br /><br />of Ms. Gyllenhaal's talents.<br /><br />I think every high school student<br /><br />should read (or hear) this book. It should be a book that is<br /><br />read, since it is timeless today as it was yesterday<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD
B00004Y6NV|5.0|ON EVERY STREET is a great rock album and is my favourite of all time.

B00005JOUM|5.0|To the reviewer who couldn't figure out what the hole in the floor was for...  Clive spent over a week behind the false wall after the release of the hostages.  Where do you think he went to relieve himself???? <br /> <br />Great Joint from Spike.
0393327655|3.0|The subtitle of Allan Bloom's 1987 classic \\"The Closing of the American Mind\\" was: \\"How higher education has failed democracy and impoverished the souls of today's students.\\" Sam Harris of Stanford reminds us of how little that has changed. If ever we were looking for evidence of impoverished souls in America it is this book and its admirers.  <br /> <br />Forgive me for reviewing \\"The End of Faith ...\\" without having finished it. The idea that the love and tolerance advocated by the likes of  Mahatma Gandhi and Jesus Christ ought to be replaced by the preaching of someone like Harris who says, for example:  \\"Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them. . . .\\", rendered the book, for me, unreadable. \\"[E]thical to kill people for BELIEVING them?\\" Did you get that, folks? Not \\"ACTING on them,\\" \\"BELIEVING them.\\"   <br /> <br />I gave the book three stars because it it serves as a warning of the potential consequences of  the culture war in America. It is simply remarkable that \\"The End of Faith ...\\" could become a best seller with a four star Amazon rating without more people acknowledging it as a crypto-fascist polemic. Perhaps we are ready for an American Mein Kampf. <br />
B00005Y7GQ|4.0|I really only wanted to see Vicki Zhao doing her thing but the whole movie seemed great. Obviously the visual effects were excellent and I loved the finishing goal against Team Evil. Woot! <br /> <br />P.S. 4 stars because neither the American nor the Import versions I got had the Special Features! The Import didn't even have the unique menu shown on the back cover (which also says special features). Ugh! Does anyone else have this problem? I.. want.. the.. special.. features.. (sob) unless there's some secret to accessing them... (sob)
B00005JKGZ|5.0|For me, this film has everything.  It has Americana, the historical content of the Worlds Fair, It has the cheerful, feel-good quality of the musical. And, to top it off, it also has a touch of Christmas at the end with the superb Judy Garland rendidition of :Have yourself a merry little Christmas\\". It's a slice of the good old days. I also love Technicolor.  The four seasons are a wonderful touch, makes me want to go back in time to the days of yor. I never tired of this film. And to boot, it is on the 100 greatest films of all times list!  <br /> <br />-jp
630512762X|5.0|Face Off is in my opinion an all time classic film, the plot at first glance is fairly ridiculous and unrealistic but it is one of those cases where if you suspend your disbelief you will love this film.  John Travolta plays Sean Archer a police detective whose son was accidently killed by Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) while attempting to kill Archer, who had been tracking him for several years.  Archer then makes it his lifes ambition to catch Troy, and early in the film Archer finally catches and apparently kills his man (Troy is in a deep coma afterwards), only after he reveals vague details of a chemical attack on L.A.  After interviewing his brother Pollux Troy, they find out there is indeed an attack iminent in L.A, but he will give no details of the location.  It is then that the undercover Face swap idea is suggested, from this point on Archer is played superbly by Nicholas Cage, who goes into prison to recover info from Pollux.<br /><br />The plot dramatically changes when Troy awakes fom his Coma, after finding a video of the operation and finding his face missing, he calls in a few associates to help him.  The doctor who performed the operation on Archer then grafts his face onto Troy at gunpoint, the few people who knew about the top secret mission are then all killed.  From this point on of course Castor Troy is played by Travolta.  I won't give away any more of the plot but what follows is both hilarious and disturbing, both leading men are superb, but Cage perhaps just steals the show, as he gradually becomes trapped in Troy's body (as Archer).  A great plot, an all star cast and superb acting make this action thriller a classic, like most great action films, there are great high budget chase scenes, hilarious moments (usually courtesy of Travolta as Castor Troy) and excellent drama.  Instead of ridiculing the plot, watch this with an open mind and you will see a superb action film, which I believe to be one of the best of all time.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Priest comes back in a big way with this one.  This is where Halford belongs.  We missed you.  This album will give your ears blisters.  It picks up right where Painkiller left off and that's just what I was hoping for.  The Priest never fails to disappoint.  The only thing that bothered mw were the lyrics to Loch Ness.  Maybe next time they can do a song about Bigfoot.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Before I get to the part of the review where I praise this film endlessly, using as many adjectives as possible, I should like to point out the single mistake made by Peter Jackson and his crew, a mistake that takes away quite a bit from the movie, especially the end.  It's a mistake that kept King Kong off of my 10 Best of 2005 list.  The rather big mistake is the casting of Jack Black to play Carl Denham.  Granted, this character is supposed to be disliked and greedy, and basically the lowest of all creatures.  But Jack Black can't even take the easiest role in the film and make anything of it.  His lines are said with such little seriousness, that it completely drags the emotion out of some of the scenes in the film.  In the end (I won't spoil it), Black is given a short line, the final line in the film; it's a line of extreme importance to the film, a line that caps off the movie.  Black completely slaughters it.  In the end, I didn't carry out as much of emotion as I was supposed to. <br /> <br />Now, with as much of an emphasis that I have placed on this film, you may be wondering how I am still giving this film five stars.  Peter Jackson is the reason this film gets five stars.  Jackson's vision is what made this film brilliant.  Despite his error in casting Jack Black, he completely makes up for it by casting the amazing Naomi Watts (Academy Award Nominee for Best Actress, 2003, 21 Grams).  Watts is radiant as Ann Darrow, and really was born to play this part (pardon the pun from the movie).  I also like the character of Jimmy (played by Jamie Bell) and his discussion of the Heart of Darkness with Hayes (Evan Park).  It really adds to the substance of the film, giving it a great amount of depth.  The tender scenes between Kong (played by the great character actor Andy Serkis) and Ann are brilliant, and they really improve the mood, and the emotion of the outcome.  Adrien Brody didn't really impress me here, although he wasn't bad, either.  No, the show really belongs to Kong and Ann.  Their brief scenes (which are almost always interrupted by humans) are brilliantly shot.  The cinematography is fantastic, and the effects are amazing. <br /> <br />Peter Jackson has created a wonderful follow up to 2003's Best Picture Winner The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, and his talent as a filmmaker is astonishing.  Jackson will be forever compared with James Cameron (Titanic) as one of the great epic filmmakers of all time.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I was reading the negative reviews on this album and thought that this must be the worst album ever.  So I went back and listened to it in its entirety.  This album isn't bad.  I enjoyed it, actually.  I really don't thnk they were slacking on this.  It's not I&W, but it's not as horrible as these reviewers would have you believe.  I guess that's why I read these reviews for amusement and would never base my buying decision on them.  No problem with this piece.  If you want to hear the worst album ever, then may I suggest anything from Metallica since the black album.
B00005JOUM|5.0|I'm one who enjoyed THE 25th HOUR and SUMMER OF SAM and to me, INSIDE MAN didn't hold up to the high standard of the other movies.  However it is still an extremely fun ride and two of the actors, Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster, deliver fantastic performances.  The jury is out on Clive Owen's accomplishments here.  OK, he's hampered by a mask but just the other day I saw what Hugo Weaving could do with an even bigger mask in V FOR VENDETTA and sorry, Clive Owen fans, your boy isn't really giving the part as much as he might.<br /><br />At the end I was a little bit puzzled about why the bank robbers had committed the crime.  Wish someone would explain it to me!  Was it just for the money--apparently not.  And why would our lead villain hold on for so many years to a document that incriminates him when he could have disposed of it at any time?  And also, how old is Christopher Plummer supposed to be, anyway?  I would say he would have to be around 90 for the story to really work.  Sorry, he doesn't look ninety.  However all these quibbles amount to Monday morning quarterbacking when one considers the brilliance of so much of the rest of Russell Gewirtz' ace screenplay, which gives us everything we want from a police procedural and more.<br /><br />Denzel's character this time out is a private man with strong ties to his job and his community but he's feeling those ties start to fray, especially when $140,000 worth of cash money has walked out the door under his watch during a recent check cashing sting operation, so for the first time he's on the defensive, very much so.  In his home life he is living with an extraordinarily sexy colleague whose young brother's a crackhead and lives in a cot together with them in a too-small apartment.  Situation volatile, but Keith Frazier doesn't sweat the small stuff.  Though it may seem as though Denzel has played this part a thousand times, he completely reinvents himself here and only once or twice does our normal Denzel sneak in, take a quick bow, and disappear again behind the Frazier mask.  I for one would enjoy seeing him and his partner solving another case, pitting against another super villain.  The partner is played by the British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor who was also in Spike Lee's crazy SHE HATE ME movie.  But mostly I remember him from being the bad guy in SERENITY.<br /><br />My favorite however is Jodie Foster.  It's excellent that Foster seems to be returning to films in a big way, what with this, FLIGHT PLAN, that French movie, and upcoming a new picture with Terrence Howard.  Though some dislike her for being cold and controlling, here she takes her worst flaws and really plays them up as Madeline White.  And girl, she looks good in a NYC ivory linen power suit with her long, long legs and hip swinging walk.  She's playing a woman who likes men, a lot of men, a lot of dangerous men.  All in all a different kind of part for Jodie Foster, and she looks like she's having a ball, good for her.l sneak in, take a quick bow, and disappear again behind the Frazier mask.

B00000AFDW|5.0|I grew sick of reading the nitpicking moans about Ace and Peter not playing on the entire album.  I don't care.  Simply put, every song on this album rocks.  Take it for what it is.  You got foot stomping, raise your fist anthems on this one.  Whatever choices Paul and Gene made for this album were for the best.  As I recall they were the ones who started this band and then hired the other two.  Ace and Peter's playing is outdated anyway.
B00005JOE8|5.0|We saw this movie on the IMAX screen here in San Francisco and it was fairly overpowering.  At the end of the movie we just sat there in our chairs while the Rolling Stones' \\"Street Fighting Man\\" blared out of the 108+ speakers hidden behind the screen, too drained to say anything but eager to agree.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is OK, her disturbing and irrelevant resemblance to Sinead O'Connor made us wonder why they just didn't go whole hog and put O'Connor in the movie.  She's not the world's most interesting actress but she seemed to be giving it her all, so we wound up liking her even at the same time as we were thinking how  tiny she is, like a little elf.  And the torture scenes seemed so unrealistic, like wouldn't a sneeze blow her against the prison cell wall and splat her like a flyswatter?  No way could she withstand the abuse she's dealt out in this movie.  I thought she had it bad in GARDEN STATE being forced into kookiness the whole time but here she has to represent the entire viewership of the movie as she (and by extension, ourselves) are argued and browbeaten into radical politics, possibly anarchy, by a well-written screenplay and a series of haunting, scary images on the screen.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving fares better, even with his painted on china (or is it bulletproof steel) mask and its great painted grin, like a merry-go-round horse grinning in a death rictus.  I thought it strange that he would choose as his theme song \\"Cry Me a River,\\" but the other song he plays, by Antony and the Johnsons, really hit the note of the sexually \\"other.\\"  When V falls in love with Evey, it really does change his plans as well as his perspective on the ultimate meaning of life and death.  As a love story, V FOR VENDETTA is a little bit similar to MY FAIR LADY.<br /><br />Is there some special pleading in the movie for gay and lesbian civil rights?  I don't see how you can read the subplots of Gordon Dietrich and of Valerie Page any other way.  My hat is off to a mainstream American movie that dares to raise these issues in the current climate of rightwing homophobia.<br /><br />Someone at the theater said the filmmakers had originally cast James Purefoy, whom I remember as the faun in NARNIA, to play V, then after a few scenes realized he wasn't working out, similarly to the way Viggo Mortensen wound up replacing Stuart Townsend as Aragorn in THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  I watched the movie and I concur with the filmmaker's decision.  I just can't imagine V played by anyone else but Weaving.  But this isn't really an actor's movie, is it?  (Although Stephen Rea does some magnificently simple yet enthralling work as Chief Inspector Finch, the policeman who gradually goes over to the \\"dark side.\\")  I was astounded by the way that, individual plots points and loose threads seem to disappear into outer space while leaving us with a modern fable of great power and communal beauty and fire.to a mainstream American movie that dares to raise these issues in the current climate of rightwing homophobia. <br /> <br />Someone at the theater said the filmmakers had originally cast James Purefoy, whom I remember as the faun in NARNIA, to play V, then after a few scenes realized he wasn't working out, similarly to the way Viggo Mortensen wound up replacing Stuart Townsend as Aragorn in THE LORD OF THE RINGS.

B00000AF95|5.0|This was KISS' greatest album of the 80's.  The songs are dirty and hard driven.  I would've been interested to hear how the band would've sounded with Mark St John on more albums.  It was seeing this particular tour that made me pick up a bass and start playing.
B000E1YVZU|2.0|This was really hard to get through. Around the 48 minute point, the urge to turn off the movie became evident and did not leave throughout the whole movie. Rent is set at the East Village of New York City in the late 1980's. The film, adapted from the Broadway show of the same title, follows a group of bohemian artists through their journey of trying to produce the art that they love, yet still be able to have enough money to pay the rent of their respective Penthouses. Apparently, 90% of people that live in New York City have AIDS, or so that is what you are led to believe by this film. Rent tries to grab the bull by the horns and produce a film that touches upon the issues that city dwellers are plagued with. Here are some reasons why it fails to do so. <br /> <br />\\"Rent\\" the film, tries way too hard to replicate \\"Rent\\" the play, and fails miserably. Many of the original cast members of the stage return to act their roles in the film. The result is a slew of lackluster performances. These actors who are not used to the cameras so close because of the separation they have from the audience on stage seem unemotional and undetermined to make their roles believable. Or maybe it's because when they are on stage they are more diligent on the acting side, but with the audience replaced by a camera, maybe their heart isn't in the role as much as it usually is when they are amongst the people in the crowd. For whichever reason it is, the acting didn't deliver nearly as effectively as it does when seen live on stage. <br /> <br />The musical numbers were sang well and conducted correctly, but yet again the lackluster demeanor of the cast makes the music mediocre at best. When you see the Broadway performance of Rent, the personalities of the actors seem a lot more real. With the separation between you and your TV screen, you realize that the songs are not even as great as you thought they were. The magic of seeing a Broadway show is the relationship that you feel with theactors. There is a certain chemistry that lives in the electricity that the actors emit while on stage. On the big screen, the audience is extremely emotionally detached from the cast, which is very quick to disappoint. <br /> <br />I really think the movie could of worked if it hadn't of focused so much on trying to be the play. Director Chris Columbus tries way to hard to keep the spirit of the stage show, yet produces a sloppy production with a ton of continuity. People appear at scenes to participate in musical numbers, then reappear in the next scene, but at a different setting. The corniness of the film becomes evident when everyone in the streets start singing along with the main actors. Ok...it's a musical...we get it.  <br /> <br />In no way does this film represent the stage production of Rent. In fact, the stage production is one of the best and most popular since classics as Cats and Ms. Saigon. The film feels like a parody of the play. It is quite disheartening that this movie was made because now the reputation of Rent will always be linked with this movie. I can not ethically recommend this film, but I can recommend sticking with the play. In fact, I highly recommend the play. As for the movie? Don't waste your money. And if you must, then rent with caution...no pun intended...well maybe a little. <br /> <br />2/5
0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has written a very good and fascinating book with Team of Rivals.<br /><br />The book traces the political competition of Lincoln, Seward, Bates and Chase as they seek the 1860 Republican presidential nomination.  After Lincoln's surprise nomination (surprise to the other three), and win, he includes his rivals in a cabinet he knows will enjoy trials like no other in American history, wanting the best men for the difficult job ahead.<br /><br />Most of the book centers on Lincoln's war cabinet and how he first dominated it and then used it as an effective instrument to guide a fractured North to victory in the Civil War.  Lincoln' political genius is on display as he first wrestles with the egos of Seward and Chase and then maneuvers the Cabinet and the nation toward his ends in prosecuting the war.<br /><br />The reader gets four good mini-bios of Lincoln, Seward, Bates and Chase as well as exploration of the character of Edwin Stanton, Lincoln's War Secretary.  Most of the cabinet became his willing tools (in the sense the wholeheartedly worked for the winning of the war under Lincoln's direction) with the notable exception of Salmon Chase who would be an antagonist until finally removed to the high court in 1864 (noting that he performed very admirably and with Lincoln's appreciation in financing the war as Treasury Secretary).  Goodwin unfolds an excellent insider's look at how Lincoln and the cabinet met and dealt with all of the tremendous issues thrown at them by Civil War.  More remarkable, Lincoln was really the first president to break with the tradition of requiring the assent of his cabinet before moving forward.  Although he worked mightily hard to convince them of his intended direction, he did not shy from making his own decisions or acting if he though such actions necessary even in the face of cabinet opposition.  That these titans of the Republic were willing to not only serve Lincoln but also take a subordinate role as a body to the Chief Executive was a testament to Lincoln's absolute genius with people and politics.<br /><br />For the Lincoln buff this story will illuminate his political contributions to victory in the Civil War.  For the general reader, a greater appreciation of Lincoln's unsurpassed talents will emerge.  Goodwin has brought this subject to life and told the story well.to the Chief Executive was a testament to Lincoln's absolute genius with people and politics.<br /><br />For the Lincoln buff this story will illuminate his political contributions to victory in the Civil War.

This book is extremely well written with easy to understand illustrations and excellent organization.  There are color plates for easy identification of plants and animals to eat/avoid/use-as-medicine.  This book has it all, or at least all I can think of.  There are sections on camping, hiking, supplies, compass skills, shelter making, first aid, transport, catching and preparing animals and locating local edible foods, tool making, fishing, hunting, knot tying, general survival in different climates and environments and more.<br /><br />The best part of this book is by far its terrific approachability.  It is written for the layman and is very easy to understand.  Either as an outdoor accomplice or a handy at home preparedness guide, this is a book to get and know.

B000002TWN|5.0|D'Angelo's \\"Brown Sugar\\" has got to be one of the best neo-soul albums of all time. Definitely one of the best albums in the past 12 years. It dropped in 1995, and since then he dropped \\"Voodoo\\" in 2000. I also have Voodoo as well, and it's a great album too but it falls just short of this amazing Brown Sugar. Since I've just recently branched out of just general R&B music (since I'm a big fan of almost everything that you can apply an R&B tag to except for club feature-a-rapper-in-my-song-so-it-will-sell R&B now) I've never really heard of D'Angelo before. So what best to do than to get on Amazon and check the album out? So I see all the good reviews claiming that this is a classic album, so I decided to download it. Well trust me, if you are an R&B/Soul fan, you don't have to download this, go straight out and buy it (it's only $10.00 here). It's worth every bit of your money.<br /><br />To start off, my favorite track on here is \\"Me and Those Dreamin' Eyes of Mine\\". It has that real nice laid-back, chilled vibe to it. D'Angelo sings a perfect bridge and hook that will have you easily singing along to it. This song STAYS on repeat. Another favorite of mine is the explicit titled \\"Sh*t, Damn, Motherf*cker\\", which tells a story about his wife cheating on him with his own best friend. In the moment he kills both of them, and ends up arrested by the end of it. I love this track, it's a little darker than the rest of them but that just fits with the story. \\"Jonz in my Bonz\\" is another great track. It also has that chilled feeling to it (well honestly the whole album does) and it'll have you nodding your head and just vibing to it. \\"Brown Sugar\\" is a good track where he uses clever metaphors to talk about smoking reefer. It doesn't take a genius to find out what Brown Sugar is does it? \\"Alright\\" is a track that blends harmony in well to achieve a nice ear-pleasing effect. Alright describes how misundestandings and arguments in his relationship won't tear them apart because they both love each other and they can work through all that. \\"When We Get By\\" is a bouncy track that works. It takes on a real jazzy approach towards the end of it. \\"Lady\\" has a hip-hop vibe to it. \\"Crusin\\" is a good remake of Smokey Robinson's song of the same name. I've never heard the actual version by Smokey, but I have to say this song makes me want to hear it! It's slower and his high notes are hypnotizing. \\"When We Get By\\" is an upbeat, bouncy track, which will have you singing carelessly along when it hits the chorus. \\"Smooth\\" has a crisp clean chorus sung perfectly. \\"Higher\\" is a perfect album closer.<br /><br />D'Angelo did everything on this album. He produced, written, and performed everything. He is very musically talented, and it'd be stupid of you to pass up on this album. He is truly a musical genius; the sounds he beautifully crafted together on this album will have you singing along and nodding your head in no time.

0345350499|5.0|I was so disappointed when I had reached the end of the book, I didn't want it to end!  It was so good that I have declared it my new fave.  The story of King Arthur told from the woman's point of view is so well done here.  The characters are so real, the situations as if they really occurred.  Although the story itself is truly a page-turner, I found the feelings that it stirred in me to be more amazing.  This book made me feel closer with the Goddess Religion, and raised ideas, thoughts, and feelings that I've found to be very enriching on the Goddess path.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|First of all, I enjoyed this version; I really did. What it got right is a more distinct sense of the darker and chaotic side of Jane Austen's worlds. There's a lot of melancholy here, which wasn't rendered in the preceding TV series. The Brits--though this time contaminated by French input, which didn't help at all; it seldom does-can do Austen very well indeed when they put their midns to it. The BBC version of Emma with Kate Beckinsale was so much superior to the boring Paltrow cinema version.<br /><br />Where does this latest production of P&P fail?<br /><br />The first problem coming to mind is the script. Adaptation is an art all of its own, and while the TV series had time to plot out most of the significant narrative strands of the novel, two hours of film doesn't. Purely from a scripting point of view, significant characterizations--'significant' in the sense that they contributed to the explication and bringing-to-live of the central characters--were far too 'pro forma', almost as if they were thrown in because the writer felt that they needed to. The result was that many of them had no function at all, and cluttered up the action and diffused the narrative focus.<br /><br />The second problem had to do with direction. The first half, with the aid of the muddled script, was confusing, unconvincing and occasionally annoying. I loved the deconstruction of the decorous superficiality that adhered to the TV series, and the occasionally chaotic social occasions; but in the end it got too much, and the interactions of the main characters were lost, instead of, as the director presumably intended, contextualized. Also, the sound was awful. The deliberate toning-down and made-hard-to-hear-above-the-din of individual conversations may have had an element of realism, but the strain of the listener, having to work out just exactly what was being said, didn't help one's becoming engrossed in the tale. The vacuous sisters and mother and their hysterical carry-ons also became annoying and were overdone and for too long.<br /><br />Third problem: Keira Knightley. She's a cool actress, who fits perfectly into King Arthur, Pirates of the Caribbean, Love Actually--but here she was very much miscast. If the producers had had any guts they would have cast the incomparable Rosamund Pike in that role, instead of wasting her in the nearly-invisible part of Jane Bennett. Rosamund was the saving grace among the women of Die Another Day, and here, too, she basically stole the show without even trying hard whenever she appeared, whether she said or did much or, as was the case for the most time, not. Keira, by contrast, needs to act-by-effort since she doesn't as yet have enough depth of personality. Too much 'star' and not enough 'character'; quite unsuitable for this part. She battled her way through it valiantly, and I admire her for that, but it just wasn't 'right' for her. The mis-casting was rivaled only by the casting of Katie Holmes in Batman Begins.<br /><br />Fourth problem: just about all the male characters, except for Donald Sutherland, who can do no wrong. That the film should fade out with a shot of him was an unexpected stroke of genius. I wonder if it was scripted that way or a directorial decision. (I never saw the alternate ending, which I probably would have loathed; so let's go with this one and pretend that the other never was).<br /><br />Having said all these basically negative things, I'd like to finish on a positive note, which is that in the second half, when the 'busy-ness' started to abate, the film actually acquired depth and became quite touching. The final scene between Elizabeth and her father was the crown, and if an ending is what makes a movie, it makes me forgive many other mistakes.<br /><br />But just imagine if, instead of Keira Knightley it had Rosamunde Pike who had been doing that scene with Sutherland. It would have been near-perfection.<br /><br />It was meant to be FOUR stars (I entered five by mistake!) and that solely because of the second half and a great attempt to take the saccharine edge off the movie-incarnations of Austen's novels.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELADIENNAattempt to take the saccharine edge off the movie-incarnations of Austen's novels.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wonderful CD that reminds us of the excellent stage production we saw recently.  Some of the lyrics that the chorus sang were a little hard to understand in the live performance, but could be read in the CD notes and appreciated.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If there's anything I'd like to add to all the good things said about this flick, it's that I wish more people would feel as strongly about the basic evil of any attempts to 'improve' human beings as Joss Whedon does. I happen to share this belief 100%, and it made, for me at least, what might just have been a big-screen 2-hour TV episode into a movie that is worthy being called 'great'.<br /><br />Whedon, knowingly or not, may have ingested a hefty dose of R A Heinlein, or someone like him. I say this because the Firefly characters, and especially the ladies, could have jumped straight out of the pages of a Heinlein story. The actresses cast to represent them are gems, each an every one of them, each in their own way. Kick-ass ladies, each naturally possessed of a sharply-drawn and distinct character, who combine intelligence and strength with an edgy sweetness that's never vacuous. I hope the actresses never have the misfortune to become 'stars', for I get the impression that may be the worst thing that could happen to any actress. But I also hope that they will never have to struggle to find work, preferably in roles where they can enchant their audience as much as they have done in Firefly and Serenity.<br /><br />If Whedon has anything else important to say to us-and I have a notion that he isn't done talking by a long way yet-I hope he does it with another visit to the 'verse and in the company of a bunch of folks I really have come to like.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELDAIËNNA, and a lot more, soon to be published.
076113719X|5.0|We LOVE this calendar! We've tried many others, but this calendar is the best. Instead of cramming everyone's schedule into one space, each member of the family has their own area. This makes it easier to read. I highly reccommend it. We buy it every year and you will too.
B000059HB7|5.0|This is a great, laid back western that features as many character studies as action scenes. John Wayne is rather low key as Sheriff John Chance, a man with a big problem. The no good brother of the town's boss is in his jail charged with murder. The town boss has all kinds of guns on his side but Wayne has only two deputies: Dean Martin, good when he's sober, and aged Walter Brennan. Later Rick Nelson joins the fold. This film is relaxed good fun. Martin showed he could play a very convincing cowboy, Brennan does classic Brennan and Nelson surprisingly holds his own as the enigmatic Colorado. (I love the song Martin and Nelson duet on.) TV stalwarts Ward Bond and John Russell also show up. Angie Dickinson is the sassy would be Wayne love interest. Rio Bravo, while not action packed, is a very satisfying western with a strong cast. This is a film we just don't see anymore; suitable for the whole family and without political lessons. Bravo Rio Bravo!
B00004RFCM|5.0|Like so many great shows, it takes a little while for them to really catch on - and by that time, you realize that you missed the early shows.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching the first episodes and getting the background story behind each of the main characters.<br /><br />This show was groundbreaking and it is certainly a great collection for anyone that enjoys great comedy.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This show is completely awesome! I love the tension, the comedy, the drama. I recommend it for those who find House to be a bit too serious or too full of technical jargon, or who are looking for a bit more relationships between characters. I like House, but I LOVE Grey's.
B00000APLB|4.0|1) It contains the only officialy released live versions of the overlooked mid-70s classics If You Can't Rock Me, Fingerprint File, and Star, Star, and all sound excellent <br /> <br />2) The version of Hot Stuff on here is better than the album version in my opinion, for what that's worth to you. <br /> <br />3) Good performances of the smash hits You Can't Always Get What You Want and Sympathy For the Devil. <br /> <br />4) A smoking version of Happy <br /> <br />5) The blues and early rock tracks Mannish Boy, Crackin' Up, Little Red Rooster, and Around and Around. <br /> <br />Now if you are a casual fan, you should get Get Yer Ya Ya's Out first.  In fact, even the new Live Licks contains more hits than Love You Live if that's what you're looking for.  But for the more seasoned fan, there are performances on here from every Stones era up to this point - very early songs, several from the 68-72 years, and at least one song from each 73-76 album.  It's a great snapshot of the band at a crucial stage of their development. <br /> <br />Having said that, I can't give it five stars for a couple reasons.  First, it's not as good as Ya Ya's.  Second, there are a couple terrible performances.  Jumpin' Jack Flash is just awful , due to Mick's lack of effort on vocals.  I've only been able to get through this track once.  If you want this one live, buy Flashpoint or Ya Ya's.  In my opinion the Flashpoint version is the best, but anything's better than the one on this album.  But when you take this double album as a whole, there is much more good than bad, and several great moments.
B000683VI4|2.0|This movie, rather than uplifting me and making me feel like, yes, there is true love out there in the world! made me depressed.  First off, the scenes with the younger Allie and Noah weren't horrendous.  It did get a little long at times, and there were parts where I rolled my eyes, but whatever.  However, I had a hell of a time getting through the scenes with the old people.  I found myself unable to relate them to the younger versions of Noah and Allie and also found them rather dull.  At the end I was just like, \\"so die already!!!\\", reminiscent of my experience with the Gerard Depardieu version of Cyrano de Bergerac.  Plus the writing in that notebook was totally sappy and actually fairly horribly written.  If I was Allie and I had written that, I would be ashamed of myself.  I mean, the girl goes to a freaking Ivy league school and that's how she writes??  Yeesh.  Anyway, I found myself ultimately not caring about the fates of the two lovers.  The story was predictable, the characters kind of cookie cutter . . . but hey, they're working off Nick Sparks writing.  What the hell else can you expect?  The only reason this has two stars is because Ryan Gosling looked hella hot without his shirt on.  Which was A LOT.  So if you want some eye candy, just fast forward through all the dull parts.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I definitely see why they say some will like the movie and some won't. It has laughs but not gut busters. I found this movie to be very funny that has jokes at the right time. It's not that anything extremely funny ever happens, it's just the way Napoleon reacts to the environment around him. He's dressed like a nerd but talks like a spoiled/whiney kid. Making up stories to impress people who will never like him, eating in class, fending off bullies while trying to keep a cool status with the ladies, it's like being back in high school all over again!<br /><br />I think a lot of people relate to this movie, especially us not-so-popular ones. Like I said, this movie will appeal to some and to some it won't. I can very easily see where people could watch this movie and not understand what's so great about it. But it is great, and to those who think so will agree that this is a movie that will go down in cult history
B00006CXXU|5.0|I think this CD is excellent.  Each song is very personal, genuine and soulfull. Easily Christina's best album to date and i look forward to future albums.
B00003CXDB|4.0|It seems to me there's a certain type of photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them apart from any other era. I'm not arguing it's either better or worse than others, it just feels different and very distinctive. In this light, \\"Wall Street\\" reminded me vividly of \\"No Way Out\\" for instance - which happens to be from 1987 as well - and several De Palma films. Don't ask me why. It just does.<br /><br />Useless considerations apart, \\"Wall Street\\", directed by always controversial Oliver Stone, pictures the almighty frenzy in corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away. They always burn out, in a snap of fingers. And bigger they are, harder they fall, right?<br /><br />The story in itself is nothing new or previously unseen, featuring a bright young \\"sport\\", Bud Fox (played by Charlie Sheen) who happens to have a lot of potential but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life. He wants more, and hotshot Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is another broker who embodies everything he wants to become - powerful, vicious, influential and a sure winner. By sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence, Bud sneaks into Gekko's office and tries to prove his value to him. From here on the bulk of the movie shows us the average - but rather well executed in this particular instance - story of the young proteg&eacute; who rises to the top at breakneck speed until, unexpectedly, something shatters his bond to the master. Something that hits home and makes Bud question his beliefs. What this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie, so I'll let that for you to find out if you didn't see it yet.<br /><br />All the acting is quite superb, especially the relationship between Gekko and Fox. Martin Sheen - who is Charlie Sheen's father both in real life and on the screen - is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work, not selling out and not letting others - and yourself - down. He reminds me of Donald Sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he's on screen a couple of minutes at a time.<br /><br />If you like high finance intrigue, big guys pulling the strings on each other, twists and turns, then \\"Wall Street\\" is probably essential. And it will probably give you an excuse to read Sun Tzu's \\"The Art of War\\".simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he's on screen a couple of minutes at a time. <br /> <br />If you like high finance intrigue, big guys pulling the strings on each other, twists and turns, then \\"Wall Street\\" is probably essential.

0790729725|5.0|`GOODFELLAS' is the life of the gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), starting from when he was teenager, until his exile under the Witness Protection Program.<br /><br />A perfect description of his life put in great scenery adding great music, cars and outfit from every period in the movie.<br /><br />Starring Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci; They couldn't have chosen better actors for this kind of stories.<br /><br />This is probably one the best mafia movies I have ever seen. If you later share my opinion about it, I would then also recommend:<br /><br />1. Casino<br /><br />2. The Godfather; all 3 parts<br /><br />3. Once upon a time in America
B00005JOHI|5.0|Just had to add my two cents on this film....I, too, have seen the previous versions.  The mini-series does stick to the book more closely than this new movie, but with the time constraints of a two-hour film, the movie-makers had to make some decisions about Austen's story. The basic story is all there. Some reviewers have complained about the changes in scenery with regard to certain plot points, the casting, the costuming, etc., but, unfortunately, these reviewers have made these complaints without any consideration to the movie-makers' well-considered reasons for their decisions.  This movie is meticulously thought-out and it takes an exploration into the making of this movie to judge its merits fairly.  This is an adaptation of a much-loved love story that offers a little different twist to the characters, and a little different feel to the period of the story. Why not offer something a little different this time?   <br /> <br />The scenery is exquisite, the music is SO beautifully done, and the casting could not be better.  As much as I enjoy the mini-series, and as much as I appreciate that its length allows for more character development, it still has the feel of a TV mini-series.  As much as I enjoy Colin Firth's Darcy, and I much as I enjoy his other work, his Darcy really doesn't compare to Matthew MacFadyen's interpretation. MacFadyen's Darcy projects much more depth of emotion....if you TRULY pay attention to the acting, it is simply brilliant.  Just with his eyes alone, MacFadyen brings so much more human sensitivity and vulnerability to the role than Firth does. Even a wealthy upper-class gentleman is human. The rest of the cast is phenomenal, as well....so much so that I find it laughable that any reviewer of this film would suggest that the casting/acting in the mini-series is better.  It is good, but there's just simply no comparison.  <br /> <br />If you do choose to see this film, or have seen it, watch it a second time on DVD with the director'scommentary. It's very interesting. <br /> <br />The only issue I have with this adaptation of such a timeless and beloved story is that it isn't longer.  A truly wonderful film.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|I am aware that, as a teenager, I am not supposed to be enjoying this movie. I am not supposed to be pointing at the screen, laughing hysterically, and I am certainly not supposed to be writing a review encouraging everyone else to do the same. But I am, because Chicken Little is one of the funniest things I have seen in a long, long time. <br /> <br />I can't think of one thing I didn't like about this movie. All the characters are great; from the pathetically loveable title character, to his incompetent, communication-challenged father, to the self-absorbed mayor who reacts only when prompted with a cue card, everyone is a standout, and the voice actors do a wonderful job. <br /> <br />One of the movie's best parts are the extended \\"comedy sequences\\" that, according to the director, were modeled after old-fashioned Disney shorts. The laughs come quick and hard, without any dull moments. And the \\"talking\\" scenes are just as good; the rapid-fire pace of the comedic dialogue is funny the first time, yet demands repeated viewings to catch more subtleties. <br /> <br />After you've seen the movie (which has a very clever ending), the DVD version has awesome bonus features. You won't want to miss the deleted scenes, and the \\"making-of\\" featurette is actually interesting. Plus there are music videos of some of the catchy original songs from the movie. <br /> <br />\\"Chicken Little\\" should not be missed. It captures the rare magic that is usually only found in Pixar films, in that both kids and adults can have a fun, memorable experience.
B000067J1Y|4.0|This \\"Top Gun\\" spoof gets mixed emotions for me. Charlie Sheen, Cary Elwes and Lloyd Bridges are definitely the high points of the film, they are hilarious! So is this film, but towards the end during the last battle scene it gets dull. This is supposed to be a comedy, but they leave that for an almost serious battle sequence with just little gags thrown in every now and then. When you are laughing hard most of the time, you notice when the film drags. My personal favorite part is the wall eye vision. Overall, I really did enjoy this movie; it just started to drag a little towards the end, but picks up again right at the end

B000E5N62U|4.0|Donald Fagen may very well be incapable of witing bad music. So, to criticize an artist of his caliber is almost superfluous in this age of disposable music. Nonetheless, because of the high standards he holds for his own output if may be useful to discuss his work as compared to the high watermarks of his career.<br /><br />First of all, let me say that this is no Nightfly, easily the best of his trio of solo works. That being said, there are songs on here that are as musically deep, as richly textured and as lyrically savvy as anything he has ever produced.<br /><br />I read in a recent interview that Fagen considers these solo efforts to be a trilogy of sorts, the first being a look at his youth, the second an exploration of mid life and this (hopefully not his last!) being a look towards the winter of his life. Death, he claims, is the overriding theme here. While there are certainly allusions to the Grim Reaper this CD hardly seems like the last creative gasp of an artist at the end of his productive years. It is interesting to note that the one song that directly addresses the subject of death (Brite Nightgown,) is delivered in the form of a lively and infectious funky groove that makes you want to get up and boogy!<br /><br />Contrary to Fagen's stated intention, this CD does not seem to be a concept album per se. While there are a few underlying post 9/11 references, it is really a collection of expertly penned tunes which touch on a variety of favorite Fagen themes, sexual adventure (Security Joan,), rock and roll (The H Gang, a light hearted history of an all girl rock band) rocky relationships, (the autobiographical, \\"Great Pagoda of Fun\\",) political paranoia (the chilling, \\"Mary Shut the Garden Door\\",) and the ubiquitous lost souls that populate Fagen's ultra cool urban landscapes (\\"The Night Belongs to Mona\\",another gem.)<br /><br />This album, like all Fagen's stuff, grows on the listener with repeated play. The band is top notch, the horn writing meaty and tasteful and Fagen's keyboards are a joy to hear, particularly his gorgeous melodica playing which he has taken to a level of expressiveness I hadn't thought possible. At times it reminds me of Stevie's harmonica-very soulful stuff.  There are many more layered vocals here than in the past two Dan releases. It's a lushly produced recording, yet Fagen's highly accurate ear keeps everything in line and  miraculously, manages to allow the arrangements to breathe in the midst of some serious density.<br /><br />No, it's not all top of the line Fagen, but there is so much to like on here that I won't belabor the negatives. I will say that I agree with a prevous reviewer who felt that \\"Morph the Cat\\" is not the strongest tune of the lot, and seems like an odd choice to be the title track and the album opener to boot. This odd little piece about a \\"Totoro\\" like cat who showers Manhattan with good vibes seems too sunny for the rest of the album, and tends to be  pretty static. It's my least favorite tune at the moment.<br /><br />My advice to the first time listener is to hang in there; it gets better and better the further in you go. Inside, gems Like \\"Great Pagoda of Fun and \\"The Night Belongs to Mona \\" await, songs as good as anything this dependably excellent artist has ever written.

B0006B2A42|4.0|This is a 5 star for a 1968 movie and a 4 star our present time and technology.<br /><br />I was 13 years old when I saw ICE STATION ZEBRA in a movie theatre back in 1968. At that time and like any other kid I expected a submarine war action movie; in return it was a half submarine picture and a half spy story which, at that time, I hardly understood; yet I was fascinated by it.<br /><br />I watched this movie again and I am not surprised that this movie fascinated me years back.<br /><br />The submarine footage on and below the surface is excellent; the dialogue and the plot including the acting and the visual effects are way better that any other 35 year old movie I have seen.<br /><br />In general this is a great movie to watch or own. Well recommended.
B00004CZVT|5.0|A Msterpiece Theatre TV mini-series of the Nevil Shute story makes most war dramas since sloppy and unrealistic (U-571). This short novel send-up was the real deal, starring many fine actors, both Japanes and British. Told in flashback to Harry Andrews, the romantic leads are Helen Morse and a new-comer, Bryan Brown. What is missing today in any Hollywood love story is the struggle, sacrifice and testingt of potential partners dramatized throughout this series. The tension of the unselfish pair, builds to s surprise climax, but you would lose considerable enjoyment if you miss any of the realistic events that tested their resilience and courage, both the captors and the captives, when war intervenes. Well-rounded characters throughout this landscape of despair, suffering and hopefulness. A shame to be shelved this long not on DVD. Think of \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\" with romance too.
B000002IKR|5.0|Testament is awesome. Thrash metal the way it's supposed to sound. Great music for a Halloween party, with all the occult lyrics and the creeping guitar sounds (with amazing solos played by the extreemly underrated Alex Skolnick). I have no idea how this band never got huge, because they real deserved to get huge. Every single song on the album is great, with the possible exception of \\"Do Or Die\\", which gets boring sometimes, but is a good song none the less. Definitly get this if you are a thrash metal fan.
B00009AOBI|5.0|What a terrific person. How he could make so many friends despite his disease was very nice. The movie is full of drama and it's topped off with a very sad, but predictable, ending. He wasn't a famous actor or musician, he was just a normal average teen, but his life story and what he accomplished in his lifetime is a better story than 99% of the other biography movies out there. He shows us the best in us and what we can become. Cher did an excellent job playing Rocky's mother. She was very devoted to Rocky and Cher did a excellent job at showing this
B000AMF7BK|5.0|I bought this on a throwout table outside a boring local record shop. I had heard a few things by Sigur Ros before but nothing that really impressed me. I bought this because the cover was so cool. Then I listened to it. Absolute magic. The best thing I have heard for a long time. I have not yet taken out of the CD player and it has been 3 days. Like being dragged through some fantastic dream by a team of naked angels on opium. Before you leave this miserable planet listen to this record, things are not so bad after all.

0307276902|5.0|To say the least, I was undoubtedly amazed by the book.  A friend gave it to me a few weeks ago, and I simply couldn't put it down.  Even if some of the book was embellished, the central point remains - the human spirit can overcome.  I couldn't recommend anything more.
B00005JOQ9|3.0|Hostel is a pretty good movie from the director (Eli Roth) of the crappy Cabin Fever.  Almost like a snuff movie, Hostel has lots of European female nudity and bucket loads of violence.  If you like these two, this movie is for you.  Torture scenes are well done with some realism (despite the fact Hostel only cost 4 million), but I had hoped for more violence and torture.  Hostel also has a lot of laugh-out-loud moments.  From a woman getting run over by a car and a gang of dangerous children smashing in a guys head with a brick.<br /><br />Overall, Hostel is an enjoyable watch and I would recommend anyone to try it out.
B00005JMUA|5.0|And I loved it. It was an excellent conclusion to this now standing duology. I admit though, it didn't have any blood-spurting action scenes like the previous film did, but for what action there was, it was fantastic. This is for sure the best recent movie dealing with the martial arts. I absolutely loved it and it rekindled my fanaticism with David Carridine who I have been a fan of since I watched him on Kung Fu: The Legend Contiues in the 90's as well as the original series on repeats. Everyone chosen in this film fit their character perfectly. A lot of surprises that are untold are unveiled in this movie and you find yourself going, \\"oh cool\\", over and over again. Like I said, it didn't have all the action that the first movie had, but what it did have was an excellent story line. Very, very well written. I loved Pai, the one who trained \\"The Bride\\". Every character is very realistic and I just can't get passed how awesome this and it's prequel is. Tarantino really has set a new standard for martial arts movies that very few will every come close to accomplishing if they ever do. Tarantino is the genious of Hollywood and I am looking forward to his future films very much. Especially looking forward to Kill Bill Volume 3 in 10 to 15 years.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved this movie so much that, after seeing it, I purchased the entire Fire Fly series on which the movie is based. The plot is intricate, the special effects are amazing, and the acting is stupendous. Above all, there is an overwhelming feeling of camraderie that is captivating. I highly recommend this film, not just to SciFi buffs, but to anyone who enjoys movies.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|TOO MUCH TIME ON THEIR HANDS PLEASE READ..... <br />FIRST OFF....TOO ALL THE HATERS THAT FIND THEMSELVES WRITING A REVIEW ON THIS BOARD.  I HAVE TO ASK....WHY ARE YOU EVEN WASTING YOUR TIME?  IF THERE IS AN ARTIST THAT I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF I DON'T EVEN WASTE MY TIME TO WRITE A REVIEW.  FURTHERMORE, MANY OF YOU IDIOTS ARE VERY MISINFORMED. <br />I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SOME OF YOU ARE COMPARING HER TO JLO.  THEY ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ARTISTS.  MARIAH'S FIRST CAREER IS HER MUSIC & JLO'S FIRST CAREER IS ACTING. THERE IS NO COMPARISON -JUST STOP THE NONSENSE.   <br />IT IS ALSO SO IGNORANT WHEN PEOPLE SAY MC IS CRAZY. JUST BECAUSE SHE IS A CELEBRITY DOESN'T MEAN SHE IS EXEMPT FROM FACING THE SAME OBSTACLES IN LIFE THAT THE REST OF US DO.  SHE WENT THROUGH A HARD TIME AND MADE IT THROUGH.  THERE COMES A TIME IN EVERYONE'S LIFE WHEN WE HAVE TO FACE HURDLES, IT'S HOW WE GET OURSELVES THROUGH THEM THAT IS IMPORTANT.  IT MAKES US HUMAN AND HUMBLES US.  MARIAH SURVIVED IT LIKE A CHAMP.   <br />& YES, MARIAH IS THE BIGGEST SELLING FEMALE ARTIST.  NO OTHER ARTIST (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE THE BEATLES & ELVIS) HAS EVER SOLD 150 MILLION ALBUMS.  MADONNA HAS SOLD APPROXIMATELY 100 MILLION, HOWEVER THAT IS OVER A 25 YEAR SPAN.  WHEREAS, MARIAH SURPASSED THIS NUMBER BY SEVERAL MILLION IN ONLY A 10-15 YR. SPAN.  IT'S SIMPLE MATH. <br />& FOR THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE CRITICIZING HER FOR RE-RELEASING THE PLATINUM EDITION - WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE?  OBVIOUSLY, YOU ARE NOT TRUE MC FANS.  THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HER RE-RELEASING THE ALBUM WAS FOR HER HARD-CORE FANS LIKE MYSELF.  I WOULDN'T CARE IF SHE RE-RELEASED IT 5X'S.  IT NOT ONLY INCLUDES 4 ADDITIONAL TRACKS THAT ARE OFF THE HOOK, BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES A DVD.  & TO THE REVIEWER THAT SAID SHE RE-RELEASED IT 3X'S YOU ARE SO MISTAKEN.  SHE DID RELEASE ANOTHER FORMATTED COPY OF THE CD, BUT IT WAS RELEASED THE SAME DAY AS THE ORIGINAL. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE PACKAGING (ONE INCLUDING A FULL SIZED POSTER) & IT IS UP TO THE CONSUMER TO CHOOSE WHICH ONE TO PURCHASE.  & AGAIN, WHY DO YOU IDIOTS EVEN CARE.  OH, & BUY THE WAY MC IS NOT THE ONLY ARTIST WHO HAS RE-RELEASED THEIR ALBUM (LET'S SEE JLO, USHER, JESSICA S., ALICIA KEYS.... & THE LIST GOES ON).  I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE RECORD COMPANIES THAT HAVE THE FINAL SAY AS TO WHAT TRACKS WILL BE INCLUDED THE ALBUMS.  IF THE ALBUM SELLS WELL THEN THE MARKETING SEGMENT OF THE COMPANY KICKS IN GEAR AND THE LABEL DECIDES TO RE-RELEASE THE ALBUMS WITH ADDITIONAL TRACKS, ETC. <br />GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT BEFORE DISSING ON MC.  <br />THE ADDITIONAL TRACKS ON THE PLATINUM EDITION ARE OFF THE HOOK & WELL WORTH THE $.  ALSO, I PURCHASED THE PLATINUM AT WALMART FOR ONLY 9 BUCKS.  THE ADDITIONS ARE GREAT R&B TRACKS WITH MESMERIZING BEATS, GREAT REMIXES, & THE OH SO BEAUTIFUL \\"DON'T FORGET ABOUT US\\". <br />SO TO THE HATERS - SCREW YUS ALL.....ACTUALLY, IT'S QUITE COMICAL READING YOUR REVIEWS, BECAUSE THEY ARE SO IGNORANT, INACCURATE, AND MEANINGLESS.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This was Manson's Best album in my opinion. I love the dark, evil themes and lyrics in it that seem to truly express what an inner-hell must be. This is also a cd produced by trent reznor and you can tell....his artistic genious made Manson a superstar...since Manson split, the music shows and now he has no career, showing the world that he was riding on the back of a true musical genious, trent reznor. Still, this is a great CD.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember when I first heard about this western in space series and laughed it off, thinking it sounded like a silly idea. I never watched the series and when it disappeared shortly after, I felt no loss.<br /><br />At the prodding of friends I bought the movie DVD and watched it, it was decent and the setting was interesting enough. This last weekend, I was bored and snagged the DVD set on a whim. In a single day I watched the entire series. My wife, who hates when I even pass the Sci-Fi chanel on the tv, ended up watching the whole series and now cannot wait to see the movie (probably tonight, just not enough hours in a single day!).<br /><br />I have to say the series was a complete surprise as how good it ended up being. A great character study with just enough action to keep you from thinking it is just a drama. The characters are great, you learn to care about them, the setting of the show pulls you in and makes you want more, and the special effects are outstanding.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased I decided to purchase this DVD set and highly recommend it to everyone.
B000031WD9|5.0|If you are into that raunchy teen sex comedy films, then this is for you. The first time I saw the movie is when my friend let me borrow his tape after he taped it off HBO or something like that, and for some reason, I didn't like it at all, I didn't think it was funny. He had a bad tape and the volume had to be turned to the highest volume just to hear what they were saying. Maybe that was the cause of why I didn't like it. But this year I saw American Pie 2 and I thought it was hilarious! I liked it so much I went to American Wedding and it was funny as hell. So I thought that if those two were funny, maybe I should give American Pie another chance. So I went and bought a brand new copy of the movie at a store sale for $ 4.00 And this time, I was actually laughing. I love this movie just like I love the other two. I don't know if it was my friends bad copy that made me not like it at first or if it takes getting used to. But now I love it and am glad I made that decision to give it another try. So the moral to this long story is that if you don't like this movie after seeing once, but you liked the others, maybe you should give it another chance, and odds are you will love it as much as the others
B00001QEE7|5.0|Walt Disney Studio's 1989 animated adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson's classic tale \\"The Little Mermaid\\" is known for being the beginning of the Disney animation renaissance of the 1990s.  While no movie collection is complete without this gem of a film, wait for the October 2006 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD release.  Judging from Disney's treatment of their other classic films' transfers to Platinum Editions, Disney will do this movie the justice it deserves AND it will most likely be less expensive buying this new edition with all its extras than it will be to buy the currently available 1-Disc product from a private seller.  So, if you can wait a few months for the headstrong Ariel, the charming Sebastian, and the deliciously evil Ursula, it will be more than worth the wait!
0920668372|5.0|I don't have little children, so I first read this book because my mother had bought it and shared it with me. I read it to her and we both cried.  Every adult that I have shared this book with has loved it and shed tears, though it is written in language for a young child. The book starts with a mother's love for her little baby and ends with a son's love for his old mother.  The title \\"Love you Forever\\" says it all.  I highly recommend it for any age! <br />
0066620996|5.0|I bought this book at the recommendation of a colleague.<br />It did not let me down. For me it provides a guideline to follow when I will start my own business.<br /><br />When one reads this book, one should keep in mind that the companies being reviewed and praised are subject to changing management, so not all companies might still be great. But it does offer great insight into what made them great.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|OK, before seeing this movie with a friend, I'll admit, I didn't ever have an interest with king Kong, I wen't with not knowing what to expect. Wow, was I wrong. The movie was just plain amazing. It has everything you'd expect in a great movie, action, romance, scary scenes, sad scenes, happy scenes, etc. I was in awe at the end and so was everybody sitting in their seats after the movie was over. I am now a King Kong lover and am buying the DVD RIGHT when it comes out!
B00003CWPL|5.0|Some films target your mind and seek to educate you.  Some films expect you to put your mind on hold and pull for a purely emotional reaction.  A few films (darn few these days) seek to stimulate both the mind and the heart together.  \\"Eraserhead\\" is none of these; it is a visual experience that invites your mind's input, but only after your most basic emotions have had their fill.  If that sounds confusing, brother we're just getting warmed up. <br /> <br />I will not relay the events that take place on the screen (I prefer not to say \\" the plot\\" as that term feels limiting).  A description of the events would be counterproductive; it would not elicit a basal emotional response.  Suffice it to say that odd events take place, framed in an environment that both challenges and directs the senses.  Auditorially, the film has a ubiquitous background of almost rhythymic industrial noises.  Visually, the film is balck and white, shrouded by ill defined borders and shados.  This framework gives the events a dream-like quality.  The events are strange, and yet, strangely familiar (new parents and guys who have met their girl's parents over dinner will recognize some of the feelings protrayed in the film).   <br /> <br />After seeing \\"Eraserhead\\" you are likely to feel confused.  Try to resist the impulse to analyze it intellectually.  Instead, take stock of your feelings.  Did the film repulse you, attract you, or both?  Are you intrigued?  Disgusted?  Nervous?  Excited?    Personally, I had numerous emotional reactions to the film, some of which developed gradually.  That kind of varied response is something vast majority of banal Hollywood fare can never hope to provide. <br /> <br />Above all, avoid the temptation to make \\"Eraserhead\\" a mere intellectual exercise.  Anyone claiming to know the \\"true meaning\\" of the film is either deluded or putting you on.  Watch it, see what it does to you and learn from it.  There are very few movies in existence that can ofer that.
0743518136|1.0|PT Barnum had it right when he said there is a sucker born every minute. It seems that many of those poor suckers have wasted their time and money with this nonsense. The contents of the book are hardly any better than plain old astrology. Strictly psuedo science.  <br /> <br />I was ordered to buy this book by my employers corporate higher ups that had been duped in to thinking there would be value for their employees to devote their time reading the book and taking the online evaluation test.  <br />    <br />The book is designed to be a cash cow from the gitgo! You pay way too much for it in the first place, and the code that is required to take the online test is good only for a one time use. So, if you want your spouse or other family member to engage in their testing nonsense you'll have to go waste a bunch more money on another book for each new person to take the online test.   <br /> <br />If you need personality evaluation insight look elsewhere and save your money for anything else.   <br /> <br />I wish I had my time and money back!
B000050FEN|5.0|This film is absolutely ingenious. Great directing and even better writers. This film really reminds me that the majority of the movies in the theatres these days are pure crap. I haven't seen anything this good in the theatre since... I can't even remember that far back.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, and R. Lee Ermy all do a phenomenal job. This is one of the cleverest, most intriguing films I have ever seen. Seven is about a serial killer who murders six people, each in a way that acts out one of the seven deadly sins. The killer also considers himself associated with one of the sins, making for a surprise at the end. With the chilling ending and suspense throughout the entire film, this is easily my favorite crime movie.<br /><br />Flawless movie, I highly recommend it to anyone that likes suspense and/or crime.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim. I saw that this album was doing well on the charts, and wasn't hip hop or something about dancing ( I can't dance), so I figured I'd give it a spin.  I'm currently in Iraq, which isn't the most stress free enviroment. When I put this CD on, laying on my bunk with headphones on, I fell asleep. Thats the best compliment I can give this CD. Its great. It has very few loud moments. <br /> <br />It almost sounded like I was listening to a new Pink Floyd release, at the same time, which is also a compliment.  David Gilmours name has been added to my buy list, so hopefully he doesn't wait another 18 years.
0783233477|5.0|One of the greatest romantic/tragic/inspirational masterpieces, \\"Meet Joe Black\\" stars Anthony Hopkins in probably his most outstanding performance as William Parrish, a man scheduled by the supernatural mechanics of fate to die - until the Grim Reaper (Brad Pitt, in probably his greatest performance) presents himself, not as some dark and malevolent force, but as an integral part of nature - who wishes to know what it's like to live as a mortal.  The Reaper, aka Joe Black, offers Parrish a deal in which he'll extend his life, so long as Parrish agrees to act as Black's guide in the terrestrial world.  The deal is struck, but complicated when Black (inhabiting the body of a man who briefly met William's daughter Susan Parrish - brilliantly played by Claire Forlani - and who shared a mutual attraction with her) himself meets Susan, and the two begin to develop feelings for one another.  Intense, gripping supernatural drama - rich in virtually all known emotions - about characters one quickly grows to care very much about.  It's at times dark and tragic, but manages to never be outright depressing.  At other times it's bright and hopeful, and comedic and sexy.  An outstanding movie that has much in common, thematically, with \\"Ghost\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\" (both also extremely recommended).
0425188809|5.0|A suspense-filled extravaganza so alive that can only come from the masterful pen of Knootz. Detail so tightly woven together it makes a spectacular read that will leave you satisfied. I spent every waken night reading this fine noval finishing it in 6 days with blood shot eyes. Travis is the protagonist who adopted a golden retriever that will change his life forever awww[...] The epitomy of man's best friend, it will make you want to get a dog as a pet if you never had one before and i want one NOW. In rescuing a sexy neurotic recluse, they come to find out that there is more then beneath the covers. I will not give away the enjoyable plot like some people in here. Koontz's literary prowess is unmatched in the world of suspenseful horror/thriller. Anyone who never did Knootz would never appreciate man's best friend like he has. Watchers...they are out there.
B000B8QF14|5.0|back in november, shortly after i had become officially obsessed with green day, i was counting down the days until november 15th when i could go down to target and get bullet in a bible with specialy reserved birthday money. i was really not disappointed! i thought it was great, /except/... (yes theres always a but)  <br />they just cut out so darn much! i mean, even the schedualed lineup(you can see the paper on the wall back stage in some of teh shots in 'hitchin a ride') was much longer then the tracks given! evil, evil producers... even more evil, they show tiny clips of parts they chopped(tunny and the blitzkreig bop, some part where billie has a squirt gun, ect) but /nothing/! evil evil evil i say! they chopped around 2-4 hours of great content! i was upset how they edited even further in teh cd version of it.. cutting out the harmonica solo in 'minority' and tons of good crowd interactoins and extras in 'hitchin a ride' and 'holiday'.    <br />even so, i must give it a 5. even though it is the way it is, it is still great.  <br />and the preformance of 'brain stew' is awosome! /my/ favorite on there! =D
B000AXSN5G|3.0|This album could have been great.  Not a masterpiece, but pretty close to great.  Here's how.  The Painter is fine just the way it is, classic acoustic Neil and a great song to boot.  Awesome chorus, cool acoustic riff, dry production, and tight harmonies.  After this great start, the problems begin.  No Wonder is pretty bad lyrically and musically.  We know Neil does not edit his lyrics, so there is no sense in really criticizing them here.  Besides, I can handle them when they in a good tune.  Unfortunately, this song suffers from so much over production.  Had it been produced with some light drums and bass in the vein of Old Homestead, it might have been classic, but the gospel choir and electric slide guitar just make it unlistenable.<br /><br />On to Falling Off the Face of the Earth.  Great tune and melody.  Could due without Neil's falsetto at the end of the verses.  Other than that, this song is a keeper for this point in Neil's career.  Far From Home follows.  This song is total filler with lyrics like, \\"then I'm gonna really go far.\\"  God help us!  And the horns are terrible.  At least we get a little harmonica on this one.<br /><br />What follows is the obligatory piano ballad, It's a Dream.  Definitely a listenable song.  However, it is totally ruined by strings.  Just makes the song drone on and sound so sappy.  This song would have been so great had it just been Neil and piano and nothing else!<br /><br />Okay, so we come to another big clunker, Prairie Wind.  God, I was really hoping this tune was gonna be a mid-tempo jaunt in the vein of Sugar Mountain.  Just all this imagery of the prairie and stream of consciousness lyrics.  Well, what we get is droning drop D riff and a stupid chorus repeated ad nauseum by some cheese ball background singers who are really trying to show off since they are on a Neil Young album!  Enough said.  Totally missed the boat here Neil.<br /><br />Here For You follows and is a nice tune.  Not sung to well and definitely middle of the road, but pleasant filler that would have felt at home on Harvest Moon.  The following song, This Old Guitar, is listenable too.  Nice to hear Emmylou Harris.  The song is a bit boring though and the little guitar riff rips of Neil's own, Harvest Moon song.<br /><br />He Was the King is total filler and has no place on this album.  So clich&eacute;!!<br /><br />Finally, the album is rounded out by yet another piano ballad.  Like the previous one, When God Made Me is pleasant and in this case has excellent lyrics.  Unfortunately, it is totally ruined by the gospel choir again.  If this had just been Neil and his piano, it would have been a great way to end this album.  Especially considering the health issues that surrounded Neil during the recording process.<br /><br />Initially, when I heard Neil was recording in Nashville, I had low expectations for a new album.  Then I heard The Painter and got really excited.  Well, my expectations were dashed.  I was really hoping for a strong mellow album.  Unfortunately, we get bombast and over production.  I thought those days were over since we just finished two decades of over production.  Alas, this could have been a good album if we got rid of the horns, strings, and gospel choir dropped Far From Home and He Was the King completely, and rewritten Prairie Wind's music.  My suggestion, make a killer mix with the three good songs from this album, the first three songs on Hawks and Doves (since that album is ¾ bad), and add My Boy (the only good song from Old Ways).  Sweet!itely middle of the road, but pleasant filler that would have felt at home on Harvest Moon.  The following song, This Old Guitar, is listenable too.  Nice to hear Emmylou Harris.

B000C65Z1G|4.0|This movie is based on the novel of the same name. Though you will not find any scene that comes directly from the book, the movie is well done. The director takes a different point of view in showing us the story then the author did. I found it wonderfully entertaining.  The movie takes its time working itself up to the thriller it is, but that is also how the author writes. <br /> <br />The acting is done well and I like the fact they shot the film on location. You can see the actual <br />locations described in the book. Definitly worth renting.
B00022TPSO|5.0|Quite simply, this is probably the most influential debut release ever.  All hard rock and heavy metal that is in existence today, whether the artists performing it know it or not, is indebted to this classic.  The question is: how does it hold up today, 36 years later?  The answer: better than almost every hard rock or heavy metal album released since. <br /> <br />1. Black Sabbath-5/5.  This song is superb.  I can only imagine what was going through people's minds the first time they heard this song in 1970.  It starts with a thunderstorm and a faint church bell and blasts into one of the most recognizable riffs in history.  Slow and doomy, with some of the greatest lyrics ever.  Perfect song. <br />2. The Wizard-5/5.  Very cool bluesy song with some great harmonica playing by Ozzy.  The lyrics are excellent and the vocals are superb. <br />3. Behind the Wall of Sleep-5/5.  This one has a hard driving beat from Bill Ward on drums.  The music isn't that heavy, but the beat is great and the lyrics are trippy.  Great vocals, too. <br />4. Bassically-4/5.  An excellent bass solo by Geezer.  Just goes to show just how great of a player he really was back then, and he has only gotten better since. <br />5. N.I.B.-5/5.  My personal favorite Black Sabbath song.  The riff is super heavy.  The lyrics are excellent and the vocals are perfect.  This song really epitomizes heavy metal.  Meant to be played REALLY loud. <br />6. Evil Woman-4/5.  I don't particularly care for this song very much.  It's a cover song that, I think, was forced on them by the powers that be in Britain, considering that it was not on the American release.  A little wimpy, but they attempt to make their own. <br />7. Sleeping Village-4/5.  A slow and sludgy song that's mostly instrumental.  Great music that is played perfectly. <br />8. Warning-5/5.  A bluesy, obscure cover song.  The lyrics fit Sabbath perfectly.  Instead of covering the song and leaving it at that, they use the opportunity to open the song up a bit and showcase how great the musicians, particularly Tony Iommi, the guitarist, really are.  A little long, but never boring. <br />9. Wicked World-5/5.  Another bluesy, but heavy, song.  Really heavy riff by Iommi and great vocals by Ozzy.  Excellent. <br /> <br />This album holds up perfectly.  In fact, it may even be better than it was 36 years ago, because at the time, the only thing to compare to was Deep Purple's \\"In Rock.\\"  This just blows that release out of the water.  In sheer heaviness, it can still compare to much of what is being released today.  Highly recommeded to any fan of classic rock and modern hard rock or heavy metal.
6302420326|1.0|JFK, the worst of Oliver Stone, begins with General Eisenhower's 1961 warning to America about the complex miscegnation of the military & industry.  Eisenhower's warning, which has totemic or iconic status on the Left because it seemed to presage a half-vast right-wing conspiracy, was apparently abbreviated for public consumption.  According to the leftist New York Review of Books, the old general intended to denounce an unholy alliance of militarism, industry, and Congressional Democrats who berated Ike for Cold War bomber gaps and missile gaps that he knew didn't exist.  One of the Democrats demanding more billions of dollars for useless armaments against the USSR was Senator John Kennedy, who almost certainly knew the gaps, if they existed, were in our favor, not theirs.<br /><br />Oliver Stone and his JFK fantasy are oblivous to truth and nuance;  they are deadly to history.  Even as dystopian fantasy, letting a thousand rotten fleurs du mal of fever-swamp conspiracy wilt & die in the light of day, Stone's JFK doesn't work.  That's mostly because Costner doesn't work as Garrison, Garrison doesn't work as Warren, & Warren probably got it right the first time:  the best evidence & our best guess is that the filthy little communist (Jackie's words) did it with the Mannlicher-Carcano in the Depository.<br /><br />Stone emptied the asylum on this one.  He built his bogus bs on Jim Marrs (sane, but a mercenary for the unhinged), Prouty, & the jolly green giant who easily ran over the Big Easy until a sober jury took about one hour to laugh him out of court.  Jim Garrison was an American monster.  He got headline news in the most fevered swamps (Ramparts Magazine) of the Left at a time when the Left's fevers were almost terminal.  He destroyed a good man, Clay Shaw, in a judicial conspiracy of emotional blackmail & emotional extortion.  Emotional rescue for New Orleans came only when Garrison took his bad case to court where the case collapsed, like Shaw, for whom rescue came too late.<br /><br />Stone should be ashamed of himself, but he's shameless, smirking all the way to his large-cap portfolio.  If he was going to make an Ed-Wood horror show, he should at least have hired a better man to play the lead, but hey, people bought their tickets & bought his septic-cesspool posturing anyway.  Then they went to see Stone's Natural Born Killers, maybe even worse than Stone's JFK.  Go, as they say, figure.
0380820846|2.0|When I read An Offer From a Gentleman I thought for sure that I had found my new favorite romance author, but this book really didn't do anything for me. <br />I like the 'Sabrina' like story, but I think Colin's attraction to Penelope wasn't developed believeably. He fell in love with her too fast and for no reason.  <br />And Lady Danbury was just obnoxious. I had to roll my eyes every time she said how clever and wonderful Penelope was (which was about 45 times), because Penelope never really said anything clever.  <br />I liked the Lady Whistledown mystery to a point, but overall I thought this book was pretty weak.
B000002A3T|5.0|My guess is that the complete morons who gave this album less than 3 stars would probably list The Wall or Darkside Of The Moon as their favorite Pink Floyd album.  Why, because they don't have an original thought in the microscopic minds.  So, continue to FOLLOW like sheep, you'll never be capable of anything else.  The Division Bell is a great album for any true Pink Floyd fan.  It's a triumph over A Momentary Lapse Of Reason which just didn't come together very well.  There's not a song on The Division Bell that doesn't display great song writing and musicianship.  I now have to put this album on the top of my Pink Floyd list.  In two words... Roger who?
B000002UAF|5.0|This is the 1987 CD version released in America of the original 1964 British LP, not the American LP. In England, it was the group's third full-length LP, and not merely a \\"soundtrack recording\\" to their film. This CD version here is exactly how The Beatles intended the music to be ... as a full album. It also has the original blue and white British cover found on the British vinyl version from 1964. All of The Bealtes CDs released in 1987 were the British LP versions, not the American/Capitol Records version. And, all of the British LPs (the American CDs) are superior to the American vinly versions from the 1960s in sound, song sequencing and cover art. <br />Enjoy this for what it is, an original!
B00005NB8K|4.0|4 stars for Val Kilmer who fills the boots of a \\"lamentable wreck of a human being.\\"  Meg Ryan belatedly caught on to the obvious fact that she was playing a part in a cautionary tale, but she caught on too late to improve her part in a sordid tragedy that grinds down from not bad to bad. <br /> <br />Oliver Stone's movie is, again, Oliver Stone OD'd on purple strychnine.  He's stoned, lost in a purple haze, but is very far from immaculate.  What saves him here is what saved the lizard kingdom (until the main man, like Marat, went down for the very last time in a bathtub in Paris ... or so they say):  a powerful, insidious, incantatory sound confected by Paul Rothschild at a console in the lab.  A sound from the dead past that lights up the deadly present with flashes of holy lightning. <br /> <br />Jim Morrison was pronounced dead years before he died.  He was, said the cool coroners & smiling morticians of his generation, a dime-store Rimbaud, puerile, simplistic, sophomoric.  He had been a sophomore, maybe a high school freshman, very high, who wrote about the mute nostril agony of the horse latitudes, words that seem almost perfect now, almost alive, almost evocative of our deepest secret fear. <br /> <br />Like a horse in a dead sea, Morrison was pushed overboard. Kilmer catches some of the stiff green desperate gallop of a bad man, prematurely old, poising, pausing, sinking & subsiding.  Of the convenience of death at an early age.  Of a fat man sick of himself, flailing with shoulders as smooth as ravens' claws.
B0000696I0|5.0|Sure, the first TMNT film is a classic, but I've always prefered TMNT II, and it's one of my favorite movies from my childhood. It has the coolest/greatest opening sequence out of all of the TMNT movies, the foot soldiers, Paige Turco as April, and most of all, SUPER SHREDDER! Let's not forget Vanilla Ice's \\"out of nowhere\\" performance as himself, performing \\"Ninja Rap\\". What more could a young TMNT fan ask for (especially in the early-to-mid 1990's!)?<br /><br />In this film, the turtles find the substance that made them mutate into humanoids, and they find out where it came from. Shredder finds out about it as well, and he uses it to become SUPER SHREDDER, as well as create two monsters that will defeat the turtles, Rahzar and Tokka! So, basically the turtles have to recover the ooze, and defeat Shredder and his monsters.<br /><br />Sure, the film seems to be \\"sooooo 90's\\". Sure, the TMNT fad from my childhood is over. However, this film holds up well, as does the first film. Today, I'd consider this a great B-movie, or even a guilty pleasure. If you were a fan of TMNT during the late 80's/early 90's, check this out if you haven't already! Oh, and do yourself a favor by AVOIDING the third TMNT film. It's atrocious.
0684824906|5.0|A great book, easy to read and easy to get caught up in. Doris Kearns Goodwin did an amazing job with this book. She delivers  the incredible story of one of the greatest leaders in human history, and the gifted yet temperamental cabinet that he chose to maintain. Abraham Lincoln's magnanimous leadership style should serve as an example to todays leaders to help eliminate partisan bickering, and the practice of revenge politics.
B00005JOE8|4.0|Cinematic translations of graphic novels and comic books seem to be gaining prominence these days with \\"Sin City\\", \\"A History of Violence\\" and \\"Aeon Flux\\" as three examples of this growing genre. Here is another one adapted from a series of comic books written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd between 1982 and 1985. Produced and written by the Wachowski Brothers in their signature \\"Matrix\\" style and directed by their protege James McTeigue, the movie has a wildly inventive premise that despite its twenty-year old origins has a timely relevance in a post-9/11 world. It is indeed a comic book come to life, but it's also an often powerful political allegory that takes subtle jabs at the current administrations in both the UK and the US.<br /><br />It's all set in a dystopian London in the year 2020, a time when England has turned into a totalitarian regime under the thumb of fascist chancellor Adam Sutler. The story focuses on a young TV station assistant named Evey. On her way to meet her co-worker, TV personality Gordon Dietrich, she is caught after curfew by some thugs in a dark alley. A savior arrives in the form of a masked vigilante named V, and their ensuing relationship is what drives the labyrinth plot. Starting with the nighttime destruction of the Old Bailey, complete with fireworks and Tchaikovsky's \\"1812 Overture\\" blaring over loudspeakers, V orchestrates terrorist acts in a one-man attempt to usurp Sutler. Evey is frightened but ultimately intrigued by V, as her parents were taken away by Sutler's storm troopers as political agitators. She eventually seeks sanctuary with Dietrich but then gets caught in what appears to be her own purgatory. At the same time, the tenacious Inspector Finch attempts to find V before any further terrorist acts occur.<br /><br />This apocalyptic movie dares to ask the question of whether terrorism is ever justified, and the filmmakers go about making V a scarifying but ultimately sympathetic figure. Many of the visual elements are impressive here, but various plot points do not coalesce into a coherent narrative. The Wachowskis have constructed a complex, elliptical story with so many convolutions around the various targets - the government, the media, the terrorists - that it gets difficult to keep track. Part of the problem is simply scope because the movie's agenda feels so broad as to make some of the elements feel trivial, in particular, the \\"Beauty and the Beast\\"-cum-\\"Phantom of the Opera\\" connection between V and Evey.<br /><br />On the other hand, certain passages work quite well, such as the brutalizing sequence when Evey is incarcerated and she starts to read a series of notes from a prisoner named Valerie, who has been executed for being a lesbian. There are also welcome bits of humor, for example, Evey dressed in one scene as a little girl to gain the trust of a bishop critical in allowing one of V's attacks to occur, and the Benny Hill antics on Dietrich's TV show meant to ridicule both V and Sutler. With a convincing British accent, Natalie Portman is solid as Evey as she shows both her adventurous and vulnerable sides with equal aplomb. As V, Hugo Weaving does what he can behind the confines of the Joker-style mask. In an ironic twist to his role as Winston in \\"1984\\", John Hurt chews quite a bit of scenery in the decidedly Big Brother role of Sutler. Stephen Rea makes a subtle Inspector Finch, while Stephen Fry uses his dry comic manner to good effect as Dietrich. The movie runs a bit long at 132 minutes, but it is relentlessly creative filmmaking.impressive here, but various plot points do not coalesce into a coherent narrative.

0312263120|1.0|Thanks to the recent plagarism trial, Dan Brown has released his \\"formula\\" for writing a bestselling thriller.  This book, his first,  features all the proper ingredients the author says are needed: \\"Some kind of shadowy force; a \\"big idea\\" that contains a moral \\"grey area\\"; a treasure, and ..strong male and female characters.\\" But one key ingredient is sadly missing:  any shred of skill on the part of the author.  Reading this book is more like drudgery than fun - Dan Brown trots out a series of unbelievable characters, overblown dramas, and senseless and cynical plot twists, all folded into a swiss-cheese plot so riddled with holes the reader is forced to give up from sheer frustration.  Skip it.

0684800713|5.0|With all due respect to Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, nobody could make a better story out of nothing than Ernest Hemingway. No novel of his displays that more than his first, \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"<br /><br />The world is spinning, and so is Jake Barnes' bedroom as he tries to sleep off endless boozy evenings. Living in Paris as a writer after literally losing his manhood in World War I, he wastes his days writing news dispatches and his nights drinking with comrades he can barely stand, not to mention wilting under the glow of a woman named Brett he loves but can't have.<br /><br />Near the end of the novel, Jake neatly summarizes his last few days with Brett with the same asperity Hemingway would probably use if he wrote Amazon.com reviews: \\"Send a girl off with one man. Introduce her to another to go off with him. Now go and bring her back. And sign the wire with love. That was it all right.\\"<br /><br />One nice thing about Hemingway is he doesn't need to work with much of a plot to draw you in. His writing style is so engaging in its efficient but alive-to-the-moment style that he can describe everyday things like Basque peasants passing around a bota of wine in a way that draws you in like a Jet Li fight scene, and makes real moments of action in a bullring all the more exquisite to follow.<br /><br />Humor, too, makes this journey worth taking, as Barnes takes stock of his situation, the people drifting in and out, the different styles of bullfighting, and the casual cruelty of Brett with her various suitors, including a fellow writer named Cohn whom Jake suspects read one romantic novel too many too late in life. \\"For a man to take it at thirty-four as a guide-book to what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of the same age to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent,\\" Jake narrates.<br /><br />The fact Cohn is a Jew gets a working over, and Hemingway at times seems in danger of producing 1926's second-most anti-Semitic book. The author also presents alarming anti-black sentiments. Perhaps women are pilloried most of all. They come off here as harpies and vultures, none worse than Brett, whom Cohn in an inspired moment calls Circe for her ability to \\"turn men into swine.\\"<br /><br />Some say Barnes and Brett suffer because they know they are meant for each other, which is rot. Barnes' loss of his sex organs only spares him the opportunity to be cuckolded, which both acknowledge in unguarded moments. \\"I'd just tromper you with everybody,\\" she says early on. No, Brett is one of those fascinating but heartless examples of the user as sexual athlete, and gives \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" a lot of its punch.<br /><br />People talk about \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" as the calling card for the Lost Generation's literary wing, but while it may be true, it is hard to pigeonhole it too much. There's little talk about politics or the Great War, even intellectual matters don't really preoccupy this crowd, and the attitudes about religion are more muddled than dismissive.<br /><br />Yes, maybe there's something here about the search for meaning after the certainties of civilization were blown apart by World War I, especially Jake with his love for bullfighting and paying his bills. But what makes \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" so special is the spirit of disenchantment that hangs over everything. Why bother trying to remake a world when there's drinking to be done?<br /><br />The principle may be debatable, but it's rendered here with such precision, passion, and charm you go along with Jake and his bar-hopping buddies, enjoy their assignations and petty gossip like it was a prime-time soap opera, and after its over go back to read it again and figure out what you missed.timents.

B0000DIXDR|3.0|This movie should be previewed by parents before even considering letting your children (teens and NO younger) watch it if you are the least bit concerned about the influences of its content affecting the moral character of your child. Good acting, several scenes could have been left out and still had a good story to tell.
B00000ILDF|1.0|The \\"Alien\\" series got off to a rousing start in 1979 with Ridley Scott's masterpice \\"Alien\\", then rose to even greater heights with James Cameron's superior sequel \\"Aliens\\". Then, in 1992, came \\"Alien3\\". Read on for my review.<br /><br />It's pretty much unanimous among fans of the movies that \\"Alien3\\" is awful. However, agaisnt my better judgement, I decided to rent it. I wished I hadn't. The fans are right. \\"Aline3\\".<br /><br />The oh so convulted plot goes something like this. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), has crashlanded on a desolate planet at what she calls \\"the ass end of space\\". She awakens to find that Hicks and Newt (those who've seen the movies know who I'm taking about) were killed while in hypersleep, and Bishop has been severely damaged. She is rescued by Clemens (Charles Dance) and taken to an intergalactic prison complex, where she is surrounded by murderers, rapists and child molesters, who have managed to find faith in God. Most of these men haven't even seen in a woman in years. The leader of this born again group is the vicious yet compassionate Dillon (Charles S. Dutton). Ripley fights for acceptance and trust in this new society, but is unable. However, when prisoners start mysteriously dying, Ripley begins to get suspicious. It turns out that the alien she had battled in the previous two movies has made its way to the planet. And worst of all, it's planted its egg in Ripley. Sounds pretty good right? Wrong.<br /><br />The film is dull, depressing and uninteresting Director David Fichner ignored the ingenious vision brought forward by Scott and Cameron and made \\"Alien3\\" more of a straightforward horror movie, whereas the other films went much deeper.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that there is no moral center. Not one of the characters in this film is likeable in any way. Even Ripley herself begins to show signs of the b*tchy, dominating woman (clone) she'd soon become in 1997's \\"Alien: Resurrection\\" (which I've yet to have seen).<br /><br />I can go on and on about the film's flaws. But in the interest of saving time, I'll leave you with a word of advice: don't ever see \\"Alien3\\". Ever.<br /> <br />I can go on and on about the film's flaws.

B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|This is a eclectic collection of  synchronizing harmony. \\"The Damage\\" happens to be one of my favs of this CD, \\"Don't Hurt Yourself\\" gives a glimpse of why we all need to appreciate the small things in life.

B000E5N62U|5.0|Firstly, let us rejoice in the news that \\"Morph the Cat\\" is a LOT better than \\"Everything Must Go\\", which was Steely Dan's car boot sale nadir, and the semi-vapid Kamakiriad.   <br /> <br />Sadly, its no \\"Nightfly\\", although we're getting there - there are songs in this collection which stand up well in comparison to Fagen's finest hour.  Indeed, if you found \\"The great pagoda of funn\\" tucked away between \\"The Nightfly\\" and \\"The Goodbye Look\\", it would not seem out of place. <br /> <br />It sounds to me as if Fagen has started to tap into what Steely did best, the jazz voicings, dazzling harmonies, magnificent ensemble playing, the harmonic side, rather than just rhythms and grooves. <br /> <br />Will he ever make an album as good as \\"The Nightfly\\" again? <br /> <br />On the strength of this collection, the answer is \\"quite possibly\\"... <br /> <br />

B000BRBA8S|3.0|2046...sounds like the title of a science fiction film? But no it isn't.  <br />2046 was in my humble opinion, kind-of disappointing.  <br />I didn't really approve of the storytelling style, the pace, and the title. If they added \\"room\\" to the \\"2046\\" it'd be better. I also found the trailer I saw for it misleading. It looked like a spectacular CGI adventure romance film set in the future. But no it wasn't.  <br />It's mainly a slow, droning love story about a ladies' man writer and his numerous adventure during his life. The format of a TV series would be more suiting for it. I would have made 1/4-1/2 about his life influences for his novel 2046 and the rest acting out his actual novel, it maybe would have seemed less boring. <br /> <br />The story had an interesting premise and I liked the writer's novel 2046 (that's why I think more of that should have been acted out) The CGI sequences were a beauty to watch. And my favorite was the musical score; nicely composed.  <br /> <br />Maybe it is a film to be watched several times and with more concentration? Perhaps some of the subtitles were too simple or weren't selected right? Understanding some mandarin Chinese, I founf that some of the subtitles were short off of what they were actually saying (e.g. woh-bu-yao = I do not want (to) was subtitled as just 'no') I really wish I could have loved this film...I might go back to this film and watch it some day in the future...say 2046? <br /> <br />Reluctantly I give '2046' a three...out of five <br />~ LazerBlader
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Well actually it's their first good one.  I got into A7X a little backwards, I've had City of Evil for a couple months now (kicks ass in it's own way) and just picked up Waking the Fallen yesterday.  At least I found something to get COE out of my CD player for a while.  If you like heavy metal w/ a little punk feel I would recommend picking this one up.  I was a little leary to buy this album because I hate punk w/ a passion and hearing some people call these guys punk made me a little nervous.  I wouldn't really call them punk at all, if you like the In Flames (or have ever even heard of them, I'm sure most of you haven't though) or other bands like that check it out.  Heavy metal may still have a chance at a future.  On a side note to that guy who compared these guys to Slayer, if I ever run into you at a bar I'm going to bitch slap you.  You can't compare a newer bank like A7X to proven bands like Slayer and Metallica, give them a chance dude.  They're off to a good start.  It will be really funny in about 5 years when they're still around and kickin' ass in the heavy metal world and you decided to jump on the band wagon once other people start giving them credibility.  But that's alright, posers are cool in their own right.  Let's all try being a little happier while writing these reviews and review the album rather than resort to high school arguments. It sounds pretty stupid when you're trying to read a review about an album and someone is talking trash to someone on the other side of the country that they have never met and probably never will. I like to think there's still intelligent people left in this world. Let's not disappoint me kids.  Well I've strayed a little, but I feel much better now.   <br /> <br />Bottom line on Waking the Fallen, it's a successful attempt and good aggressive heavy metal...and there's even solos!  Almost unheard of these days.  Why are you still reading my rambling anyways, go buy it.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Like most Star Wars fans, I literally counted down the days until this was released. Then, on opening day, I saw it. And all the magic I experienced as a kid was gone. Sure it has great visual fx, but my God! The story was horrible! The Trade Federation is blockading the planet of Naboo? Huh?! What the hell does that mean? How many kids are going to understand that? At least in the original trilogy the story was easy to comprehend. An evil empire. A big, bad Death Star that can destroy entire planets. A princess that needs rescuing. It was simple, but it worked. With this new trilogy, George Lucas seemed to think that computer fx was all he needed to make a great movie. The story, obviously was secondary. As was the acting. I swear, there were times I literally cringed when certain dialogue was spoken. Ok, enough of that. It did have a few good things to offer us \\"old fans\\", but not enough to give this even a 3 star rating. Here is where I think the film succeeded and where it failed. <br />The good: <br />1) The visual fx. Wow. The film sure looks good. The vehicles, the digital characters. It sure makes the fx in the first trilogy look antique. <br />2) The pod race. Holy crap! The was ten times more exciting than the speeder bike race in \\"Return of the Jedi\\". <br />3) Darth Maul. Need I say more? <br />4) The lightsaber battles. Finally we get to see what the Jedi (and the Sith) are really capable of. <br />5) The origin of C-3PO. So, Vader/Anakin made him huh? Cool! <br />6) R2-D2. As usual, he pulls everybody's fat out of the fire.  <br />Now, the bad: <br />1) The acting. Ugh! Awful. It looks as if everybody learned their lines five minutes before they went in front of the camera. Natalie Portman is especially bad here. Sorry, but it's true. Her acting is horrible.  <br />2) Yoda. While it's great to see the old Jedi Master again, he doesn't look like the Yoda we remember. He looks...well, I'm not sure. But does have fat lips. And a strange head. <br />3) Thestory. As stated earlier, it's too confusing and many times just makes no sense. Why would the Trade Federation blockade Naboo of all planets. And why would the senate condone it? The whole story just seemed forced. <br />4) Anakin. Boy, is he annoying. <br />5) Jar Jar Binks. He's the worst one of them all. He's a very stupid, annoying and just plain dumb character. He's not funny. He adds nothing to the story. Sure, the film needed some humor, but not like this! Lucas may as well have put digital versions of the Three Stooges in here!  <br />Okay, I've been a little harsh, but I was expecting so much more from George Lucas. It was fun at times, but overall, it actually embarrassed me. Sorry, but that's the truth.
B000002KFJ|5.0|this a classic cd, every song is great. my personal favorite is megalomania, just a classic song you never hear on the radio, starts off really slow and trippy and then goes into on of the greatest riffs ever created, also love the ozzman's voice on this track. other greats are the drug induced sympton of the universe that also has a killer riff, also love the acoustic jam on this one towards the end. what else can i say, every track is awesome but definitely get this one for those two tracks alone, highly recommended.
B0009ML238|5.0|Wow! Simply Amazing! How are these guys staying under the radar?! So far this cd has been the surprise purchase of the year. It hasn't left my cd player in three months. I bought this cd because I love prog metal (Angra, Symphony X, Fates Warning, etc.) and I had heard this band sounds like Dream Theater. Already liking Dream Theater, I figure what have I got to lose. Well, let me tell you this was money worth spending.  <br />Every one of these guys just shred on here. The singer is just phenomenal! Amazing range, incredible tone, and very melodic! There's not a bad song on here. Everything works on this cd. Imagine Dream Theater's Images and Words or Queensryche's Empire. There wasn't a bad note on those cds, everything just fits perfect and Circus Maximus has done just that. This cd is full of intelligent songs with awesome phrasing, killer melodies, and plenty of odd timed sigs. The production on this cd is crystal clear. Nothing gets lost in the mix. I was surprised, especially since this cd is their first. I hope they keep the same production team for round two. <br />Like the other reviewer said, if they sound like Dream Theater. <br />SO? <br />If they're good enough to pull off Dream Theater, shoot, let 'em. Maybe this will prompt Dream Theater to start sounding more like Dream Theater! I'm not trying to piss anyone off. I'm just hoping for another Images and Words. Anyway, if you love prog metal that's insanely structured, technical with odd time sigs but has a melody you can remember. Than look no further than Circus Maximus. GREAT job guys! <br />Also, some other killer prog bands worth checking out are: Seventh Wonder from Sweden and Solid Vision from Italy.  <br />P.S. If you love this singer, he also sings for Carnivora, a band out of Norway. Ronni Le Tekro (TNT) also contributes on the cd. Unfortunately, the cd is an import and hard to find....

This story will truly stir your heart!!  <br />In other words, they just don't make 'em like this anymore!! Besides, who in today's world of actors could fill the shoes of a Gregory Peck??..or a James Stewart??...or a Spencer Tracy??   <br />Nuff said!!
B000E97HIA|5.0|I absolutely love this cd.  Everytime I open a Prince cd, I get a little scared because you never know what you are going to get.  I am always pleasantly surprised.  This cd takes you all the way back to when you first started liking Prince.  I have listened to \\"The Dance\\" about a million times now.  Tell everyone that you know about 3121.
B000002UAO|2.0|How the mighty have fallen. I recently purchased the new Beatles LP, \\"Rubber Soul,\\" and was startled to see how (a) long their hair is! It's literally resting on their ears! I didn't even know hair grew that long! And they're not smiling! (You can tell if you look at their picture on the front cover of the LP) When a camera takes your picture, smile!    Also, they've lost all creative powers. They used to sing about holding hands, twisting and shouting, dating girls who are \\"just 17.\\" Now they sing about Norwegian Woods and Nowhere Man (what is Nowhere Man? I have no idea, but I have a feeling Superman would have no trouble beating him to a pulp!)    And there's this crazy Indiany music on this one too. Hey, Beatles! You're American, use American instruments!     With our boys off in 'Nam fighting for us right now, we don't need music like this. We already have that miserable Bob Dylan to listen to with his Tamborine Man (I guess another subpar superhero) on every station on the AM dial.     Listen: I don't need this. I come home from work, all I want is for my wife to hand me a drink and put the needle on a nice LP. If that's what you want too, gentlemen, this isn't the LP for you.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|There's nothing good about 'Hostel'. That's all you need to know. <br /> <br />But since I do so love writing reviews, let me explain to you why there's nothing good about it.  <br /> <br />The basic plot concerns two monosyllabic and broadly-drawn sex hounds, (played so amateurishly by Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson: a tip, boys - find new careers!) and their new friend John Q. European, as they trek across bog-standard European cities in search of new sexual conquests. At the recommendation of a friendly Russian pimp, they head to Bratslava, to seek out girls he's shown them photos of (it must be said, the three dames in the snapshots look exactly like all the other prostitutes and loose club women they've met so far, but hey, beauty's in the eye of the beholder, right?) and be treated like the whitebread Kings Of Western Capitalism that they are. <br /> <br />Or so the picture would have you believe. From there on in, 'Hostel' becomes a mere parody of a parody: pathetic make-up effects, totally unoriginal direction and a climax so predictable as to inspire deja-vu merely add to the preposterousness and general boredom brought on by the first thirty minutes of the movie. <br /> <br />I love unnessecary violence in movies. Ditto gore. And no, movies of this genre don't really need Pulitzer-worthy dialogue in order to achieve their aims. Examples of This Sort Of Thing that work can be seen in 'Saw' and in the fight sequences in 'Kill Bill'. The directors there knew what they were doing! But the problem with 'Hostel' isn't really with the script (or what seems to pass for a script, here), nor is it with the overall low standard of performances given by the lead 'actors'. No, the real fault must once more lie with that notorious hack, Eli Roth. How, tell me, can you show a respect or a sense of affinity with your chosen genre when all you do with your movies is rehash (badly!) the same kinds of camera angles and visual devices as those movies that have gone beforeyou? Fans of Roth will claim otherwise; fine, but I have to wonder how respectful it is to reproduce someone else's work at a lower grade of quality and call it your own? <br /> <br />I really should point out the lousy special effects, too. If you're going to be voyeuristic and gory, then for heaven's sake, do it properly. Yellow goo, bright scarlet blood and rubber fingers just won't cut it anymore. <br /> <br />You can see the themes of nihilistic social commentary and anti-American, anti-European, anti-Sexism, anti-whateverthehell coming a mile off, and that puts paid to any satisfaction we might have gained from a carefully-planned subtext. So Jay Hernandez's character starts out shallow and ends up a murderer, so what? How is it possible to be interested in the escapades of a movie antihero whose sole traits are irresponsibility and gross ignorance? And to make matters worse, the script attempts to give him a little depth, a little raison d'etre, with a mawkish Hallmark-style tale of how he saw a kid drown when he was nine. Why bother, when clearly the character is 'designed' to make you not like him in the first place? The end result is confusing and throwaway. <br /> <br />'Hostel' is full of these little contradictions, these self-defeating conflicts of characterisation and idealogy that ruin what little interesting premise it had to begin with. When you add to this the total banality of the visuals and even the lack of interesting dialogue, what you're left with is a wasted 90 minutes and yet another totally substandard DVD movie, gathering dust on your shelf. <br /> <br />Avoid it.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is a great album. Anyone thinking about getting it should buy it right away. Their sound is very atmospheric and they sound like they were heavily influenced by Joy Division. Since Joy Division is long gone (don't look for New Order to help) Interpol will have to do. Great stuff, worth a listen. Great for a nighttime drive...
0140177396|4.0|\\"Of Mice and Men,\\" is a gripping story about two men who are wondering through life, from dead end job to dead end job, with only each other to rely on. George, a bright man and clearly the leader of the two, and Lennie, as the book puts it \\"a gentle giant,\\" dream of a simple life of one day owning their own land. In a line of work that does not often lend itself to forming such close personal relationships, the two men are able to use each other as a support system to some how make both of their lives a little better.<br /><br />Steinbeck perfectly describes each scene placing the reader right in the action. One almost becomes the third stooge in the story. Each chapter builds upon the suspense, ultimately culminating in an ending that does not disappoint!
B0007WZUMO|4.0|I consider myself a NIN addict - yes, I'm one of THOSE kind of people who has to have every release with every track possible. <br /> <br />When I found out the CD was coming out, and that the Japanese release had three exlcusive tracks, I immediately ordered the Japanese import instead.  The price is really hefty, but in my opinion, the three bonus tracks make the purchase worthwhile; without them, the CD is fairly lackluster. <br /> <br />For me, the first three tracks aren't listenable, and \\"With Teeth\\" starts off with \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", the first single that everyone should have heard by now either on the radio or the half-dozen movie trailers it has appeared in.  \\"All the Love in the World\\", \\"You Know What You Are?\\" and \\"The Collector\\" are all essentially boring songs with Trent repeating key lines over and over and over and over again, backed by funky, obnoxiously loud, and straightforward uninspired guitar tracks respectively. <br /> <br />In fact, other than \\"Getting Smaller\\" (which may be the weakest NIN track ever) in the middle, listening from \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" straight through is the best way to go.  Sunspots/The Line Begins To Blur/Beside You In Time/Right Where it Belongs is a FANTASTIC suite of songs that mesh together very well.  \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" also segues well into \\"Home\\", a slow, electronic song backed with methodic drumming and a neat bass line.  \\"Home\\" is an excellent song, and could (nay, SHOULD) have replaced one of the first three tracks or Getting Smaller. <br /> <br />\\"Right Where It Belongs (V2)\\" is almost an unplugged version of the album version, and the one that NIN seems to be playing on their current live tour.  It contrasts with the original, as well as compliments it, and is another great song. <br /> <br />\\"The Hand That Feeds (Ruff Mix)\\" is an awesome mix of The Hand That Feeds, and should have been available instead of one of the slew of other remixes we got on the singles.  It's a very abrasive mix, and sounds more like a Danny Lohner mix than a Photek mix, and sounds nothing like the other two Photek mixes. <br /> <br />All in all, I give \\"With Teeth\\" 2 1/2-3 stars, because there are actual tracks that I just can't stand.  The bonus tracks though, they're some real gems, and make the album much stronger.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is the best album of the 90s.(Note I said 90s not eighties like the \\"kid's review\\" who said they were a kid in the eighties)Anyways, people bad mouth this band so much on the review page that it drives me crazy! This album is a solid classic. Music will never be re-created to the glory of this album.  <br /> <br />  This is the type of music that either you hate or love. If you love hard music buy it. If you were a fan of the 80s bubble gum movement, stick with that.  <br /> <br />  This album is possibly the best album of all time(tune in to Much More Music's \\"Listed\\" 40 best albums). But then again if you love the soft ones it could very well be the worst.
B000E5N62U|5.0|Fagen's latest relaease does not dissapoint.  This disc contains a serious groove all throughout!  All tracks are solid.  like most fagen stuff this takes a few listens to fully appreciate, but the sweet groove will be apparent on first listen.  This is so much better than most of the crap out there these days it's ridiculous. <br /> <br />I was lucky enough to see Donald and his superb band in detroit and the show was phenomenal,  definitely go see it if you have the chance.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|My opinion is that's why madonna is who she is today she really knows how to make me dance, and that's why I've been a fan for 21 years and I'm only 27 it does'nt matter how old she is, she has better body then a 20 year old girl. this album is one to buy you will love it if you like dance music ever since I have it I just can't get enough of it I really like it.I think madonna looks so hot in the video hung up you should check it out <br />
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Still, it's the best concert I've ever been to - I knew it would be when I walked out of the hall in 1994.  I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD.
B000BKDOCA|1.0|I'm sorry but I don't like this remix album, I think she has better remixes in her singles, and I really  think the guy she is with we all know who is just using her for her money. and please britney don't ever think you can be better then madonna there is noway, madonna doe's sing live at her concert. I know you don't
B000089CKH|4.0|I think somebody compared Nada Surf to Toad the Wet Sprocket. I think it is a fair comparison. Most of the songs are mellow, guitar based numbers with a few faster songs thrown in. One of the latter types is \\"The Way You Wear Your Head\\" which is the reason I bought the CD. It's the best song on the CD in my opinion and one of my favorite all-time tunes. It may be an easy, pop-hook tune, but what's wrong with that? It's fun as heck!! Another song, \\"Hi-speed Soul\\" could very well be a Toad the Wet Sprocket song.\\"Treading Water\\" is another faster paced song with good hooks.The rest are good, fairly mellow tunes which I enjoyed.
B000000W5L|4.0|If a album sums up a band sound and integrity then this album does all that imo. The different takes of such musical nuances all in one package.Aside from the elitist that has said much things not up to par or off kilter etc. Just sit back and let it stand on it's own two legs and possibly it will run up and boogie woggie along with honky tonk your soul to bluesville. Loving cup torn and frayed (A brilliant cover by the crowes on their latest tour by the way) stop breaking down shine a light  among many others are simply in my mind just a seance of magical interweavings of a band working as one.And Keith Richards lead vocals on happy are simply blissful to one's ear.As another reviwer advised pass the bourbon mama and let's take a exile on main st. <br />
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This movie was just as I remember as a child.  My kids loved it. This is a nice family movie.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I read somewhere that \\"Get The Party Started\\" was added to this cd to lighten things up, because the other songs are said to be \\"depressing\\".  I don't find these songs depressing at all.  If anything, they are inspiring.  I love Pink's style and her I-don't-care-what-anyone-thinks-of-me attitude.  This album is really, really good.  Every song is different from one another.  My favourite track on the album is \\"My Vietnam\\".  I don't know what it is, but something about the lyrics make me love and respect Pink more and more. <br /> <br />Take my word for it, and give this cd a listen with an open mind.  Who knows, maybe Pink will be your new favourite artist one day. <br />
B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|Can someone give some info about how this REMASTERED version sounds?  If we want a review of the record, we'll go to the original release page.
B000000OAN|4.0|Don't listen to other reviews that say this album is overrated and that Queen is overrated. They are one of the greatest bands of all time. Their music is great and always different, unlike many bands of today that sound basically the same with every album. A Night At The Opera is Queen's breakthru album and contains the song that made them international superstars - Bohemian Rhapsody. I agree that there are a few weaker songs but they are still good and fun to listen to. <br /> <br />Death On Two Legs - 10/10 great opener <br />Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon - 7/10 possibly filler but good <br />I'm In Love With My Car - 9/10 Drummer Roger Taylor's best vocal on a Queen track <br />You're My Best Friend - 10/10 nice pop song great for radio <br />'39 - 8/10 <br />Sweet Lady - 6/10 <br />Seaside Rendezvous - 7/10 <br />The Prophet's Song - 10/10 <br />Love Of My Life - 10/10 <br />Good Company - 7/10 <br />Bohemian Rhapsody - 10/10 <br />God Save The Queen - 10/10 great closer to the album <br /> <br />Overall 104/120 excellent album. Not my personal Queen favorite but great. If you like Queen but aren't familiar with a lot of their music I suggest you check out these albums: <br /> <br />Innuendo <br />The Miracle <br />The Game <br />The Works <br />Sheer Heart Attack
6305736650|5.0|Casablanca includes the perfect blend of mystery, romance, humor, and intrigue. More than once, tough moral decisions must be made amidst formidable consequences. Rick (Humphrey Bogart) runs the most popular nightclub in the corrupt town of Casablanca. Most guests come to Rick's place for entertainment and libations. Others are gambling for a better life at the roulette table or a special favor under the table. An unpleasant outcome to a past brush with romance enables Rick to make decisions not governed by typical human emotion. However, when his painful past (Ingred Bergman) shows up in desperate need of help, will emotion blur his judgment? Bogart's debonaire portrayal of the go-to man well compliments Bergman's emotionally tortured devotee of men with contravening agendas. Casablanca is a well-cast enjoyable classic.    Movie quote: \\"Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.\\"
B000000OA6|5.0|If you know the story of Queen then you'd know that this album, released in 1991, was the last one released while lead singer Freddie Mercury was alive. Sentimentality reasons make this the greatest Queen album for me, and the tracks back it up as well <br /> <br />Innuendo - Great opener. much different style for Queen. 10/10 <br /> <br />I'm Going Slightly Mad - fun lyrics. Video is also fun. 10/10 <br /> <br />Headlong - nice rocker featuring great guitar work. 9/10 <br /> <br />I Can't Live With You - another nice up-tempo rocker. 9/10 <br /> <br />Don't Try So Hard - very moving song with great lyrics. 10/10 <br /> <br />Ride The Wild Wind - close your eyes and listen to this and you can picture yourself in the song. great song. 9/10 <br /> <br />All God's People - many fans don't like this song but I think it's a nice change of pace with some good lyrics. 9/10 <br /> <br />These Are The Days Of Our Lives - extremely moving song. if you watch the video it may bring a tear to your eye. 10/10 <br /> <br />Delilah - again, many fans don't like this song but I think it's fun and brings some color to the otherwise somber album. 9/10 <br /> <br />The Hitman - one of Queen best rock songs ever. 10/10 <br /> <br />Bijou - great guitar, not a lot of lyrics but song is great to listen to. 10/10 <br /> <br />The Show Must Go On - another moving song that'll bring tears to your eyes. Lyrics are haunting and very emotional. 10/10 <br /> <br />this album is definitely a masterpiece and should be in the home of every music fan no matter what genre of music you like. Overall rating: 115/120. Incredible album by the greatest band ever
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|The most recent rendering of Jane Austen's masterpiece \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is not the A&E version that I own and adore, but it stands well on its own. <br />I'll admit, being a Colin Firth as Darcy fan, and a huge fan of the A&E version, I was prepared to dislike this movie, and dislike it intensely.  While it was not as good as the A&E version, I did enjoy the film. <br />My biggest problems?  First, and perhaps most importantly, the length.  A&E did a five hour masterpiece, with wonderful character interpretations, dialogue and a general overview of Austen's cultures and times.  This version, coming in at 2 hours, requires certain characters and plotlines to be abbreviated, or left out entirely.  Which leads to problem number two.  Lizzy's Uncle and Aunt Gardiner are barely represented here, although they play a huge role in the book (and the A&E version).  Bingham's sister and brother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Hurst, have been axed.  Caroline Bingley has few scenes.  We never see her meeting up with Jane in London.  Mr. Collins and Charlotte have very few scenes. You are not left with the impression that Charlotte and Lizzy are good friends, but maybe just acquaintances.  Lady Catherine de Burgh (played wonderfully icy by Judi Dench)appears in perhaps two scenes.   <br />The Bennets themselves, with the exception of Mr. Bennet, are woefully underrepresented.  Despite the loveliness of the actress playing her, you don't get a sense of Jane's modesty, shyness and affection for Bingley.  You also don't get a sense of the close bond that Lizzy and Jane shared.  Mrs. Bennet in this version lacks the hysterics and dramatics that the A&E Mrs. Bennet possessed - - to the detriment of this film, in my opinion.  Mary, Kitty and Lydia seemed to be simply secondary characters, at least until Lydia runs away with Wickham . . but even then, the viewer may not have the impression of what a huge lout Wickham is, nor how precocious Lydia was.  All in all, having to tell such a beloved love story, with so many characters, is a daunting task, but a very difficult one in two hours or less.  As a result, this version feels rushed - - there is no feeling that nearly a year has passed since Bingley has seen Jane, or since Darcy and Lizzy first met. <br />Now, what is good about this version?  The two lead actors are wonderfully endearing.  No, Keira Knightly is not Jennifer Ehle and Matthew MacFadeyn is not Colin Firth.  But they are very sweet together and have definite chemistry.  When I heard that Knightley was cast as my favorite literary character, originally, I was horrified.  But I have to say that she does a very credible job.  Again, she plays Lizzy very differently than Ehle does, but it works in this film.  The scenery is absolutely beautiful and the music is absolutely perfect for a timeless love story. <br />All in all, I enjoyed this film.  If I had to choose, I would take the A&E version over this one - - just because Firth and Ehle are impossible to top, and the five hour mini-series was simply magnificent, in casting, direction, sets, etc.   <br />But for a 2 hour Jane Austen fix, this movie is worth a watch.
B000000OAL|4.0|Personally I think this is Queen's second best album of the 70's behind A Night At The Opera and just ahead of A Day At The Races. Tremendous debut for a band that would soon become a worldwide phenomenon. <br /> <br />Keep Yourself Alive - 9/10 great Queen rocker. great opener <br />Doing Alright - 8/10 nice ballad that turns into heavy rock <br />Great King Rat - 10/10 love this song. one of their best early rock tracks <br />My Fairy King - 9/10 <br />Liar - 10/10 my personal favorite on this album. also great live <br />The Night Comes Down - 7/10 not a great follow up to Liar but still not bad <br />Modern Times Rock And Roll - 9/10 great fast-paced rocker <br />Son And Daughter - 7/10 only Queen song to contain a 4 letter word which I won't say here <br />Jesus - 7/10 interesting song about the life of Jesus but not a great Queen song <br />Seven Seas Of Rhye (Instrumental) - 7/10 nice teaser to Queen II's Seven Seas Of Rhye <br />Mad The Swine - 9/10 included on 1991's re-release of this album. originally a b side. nice song <br /> <br />This album is underrated by Queen fans. It's definitely worth having in your collection <br />
B000E97HIA|4.0|One listen to 3121 and the dreck on contemporary radio will become even more unlistenable.  Prince has integrated the sonic landscapes most prevalent in popular music and synthesized it with his own unique blend of multiple music genres to create the most consistently entertaining pop record in some time.  No one, I repeat, NO ONE, can play as many different forms of popular music as convincingly and naturally as Prince. (The Black Beck?  With all due respect to the editorial writer, Prince has been at this for thirty years.  Beck makes attempts to be the white Prince! <br /> <br />Stand out tracks are, of course, FURY (a truly incendiary rocker that will bring down the house in concert), GET ON THE BOAT (super funky), BLACK SWEAT (put on the headphones and crank the volume to fully appreciate this well-produced cut of futuro-funk), LOVE (wonderful melody), INCENSE AND CANDLES (2006's slow jam of the year), and TE AMO CORAZON (not the most appropriate single, but a lovely album cut that grows on you, with no small assist from Claire Fischer's string charts). <br /> <br />The Teacher has returned...
B000000OAH|3.0|Once again, this album fails to measure up to some of Queen's other work (A Night At The Opera, The Game, Innuendo, The Miracle, and The Works). It has some great moments but also has some bad ones. <br /> <br />Mustapha - 4/10 for the life of me I can't figure out why Queen fans like this song. It's terrible! <br /> <br />Fat Bottomed Girls - 8/10 nice rocker. fun lyrics <br /> <br />Jealousy - 10/10 tied for best song on the album. awesome song <br /> <br />Bicycle Race - 9/10 nice up-tempo Queen song <br /> <br />If You Can't Beat Them - 8/10 <br /> <br />Let Me Entertain You - 9/10 great rock song <br /> <br />Dead On Time - 9/10 didn't like this one at first but now it's one of my favorites on Jazz <br /> <br />In Only Seven Days - 7/10 nice song but seems like filler to me <br /> <br />Dreamer's Ball - 8/10 see previous song <br /> <br />Fun It - 7/10 Queen's funk songs would get much better I promise <br /> <br />Leaving Home Ain't Easy - 7/10 okay Brian May tune but not great <br /> <br />Don't Stop Me Now - 10/10 see track 3 <br /> <br />More Of That Jazz - 6/10 album should've ended before this one <br /> <br />overall rating - 101/130. one of Queen's weakest albums but worth buying for tracks 2, 3, 4, 7, and 12.
0743454537|5.0|This story was everything that I look for in a great book.  Characters that are so well-defined that you think about them as if they were real.  I couldn't put this book down - it was that good. The story was believable and well written and I wasn't expecting the ending.  This book was fun from start to finish!
B000000OAC|3.0|This isn't Queen's best album by far, but it's still worth listening to. It has some great track on it. Believe it or not, We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions are not the best songs on the album but of course they're great. <br /> <br />We Will Rock You - 10/10 fantastic opener, a Queen classic <br />We Are The Champions - 10/10 another Queen classic <br />Sheer Heart Attack - 6/10 not much for the punk sound but if you like that then you'll love this song <br />All Dead, All Dead - 8/10 nice gentle ballad <br />Spread Your Wings - 10/10 one of Queen's most underrated tunes <br />Fight From The Inside - 6/10 <br />Get Down, Make Love - 6/10 <br />Sleeping On The Sidewalk - 8/10 <br />Who Needs You - 7/10 <br />It's Late - 10/10 another underrated song. Queen fans will tell you just how great this song is <br />My Melancholy Blues - 10/10 one of Queen's best ballads <br /> <br />This album is worth a listen but if you want to get into Queen's music, check out these albums: <br /> <br />Innuendo <br />The Miracle <br />The Game <br />The Works <br />A Night At The Opera
B0006IIPIK|3.0|I bought this movie for just one reason - I'd just bought a new HDTV and wanted to buy a DVD that would look good on it. I got exactly what I was looking for. This movie looks ravishing - a crisp, sumptuous, beautifully crafted feast for the eye.<br /><br />Not only are the visuals gorgeous, they're imaginative. The robots and monsters that parade across the screen are fascinating. I could hardly wait to see what would pop up next. Unfortunately, in the midst of all this imagination and craft, there isn't much of a movie. The plot is pretty simple - mad doctor sets machines loose to plunder and eventually destroy the world, while plucky, brave, and handsome/beautiful pair - an adventurer and a reporter - team up to stop him. Will they succeed? You needn't lose much sleep pondering that one, and the proceedings occur without too much tension. As they escape from various perils, you aren't balanced on the edge of your seat in worried anticipation. You sit back and admire the technique of the production and figure, if they live, they live. They are, after all, only so much attractive cardboard.<br /><br />I did enjoy this movie. It's fun to just watch when you want your brain to wind down. It's definitely worth the price, but only if you have a nice big HDTV screen to watch it on. If you can't rely on your TV to dazzle you, you'd do better to find a movie with fleshed-out characters and an absorbing plot.
B000000OAA|4.0|This is perhaps the most versatile album by Queen, incoporating many different styles of music. I don't know of many bands that can have heavy metal, ragtime, pop, rock, and even some ballads all on the same album and make it work like Queen does with Sheer Heart Attack. <br /> <br />Brighton Rock - great opener which shows off Brian May's incredible guitar ability. 10/10 <br /> <br />Killer Queen - the band's first big hit. great lyrics. great guitar work. great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />Tenement Funster - this song doesn't work for me and it is the second weakest on the album 6/10 <br /> <br />Flick Of The Wrist - hard lyrics but works well. 9/10 <br /> <br />Lilly Of The Valley - great ballad by Freddie. a little too short but great nonetheless. 10/10 <br /> <br />Now I'm Here - a Queen concert staple, traditional Queen rock song. 9/10 <br /> <br />In The Lap Of The Gods - at first listen you may think \\"what the heck?\\" but trust me it's a very good song. took me about 5 years of having the cd to actually listen to this all the way through. but now i really like it. 8/10 <br /> <br />Stone Cold Crazy - Metallica, eat your heart out! Queen's version takes the cake in every way. Awesome hard rock song. 10/10 <br /> <br />Dear Friends - complete 180 from the previous song. great change of pace though. 8/10 <br /> <br />Misfire - first Queen song written by John Deacon (bass guitar). Not his best but it's okay. 7/10 <br /> <br />Bring Back That Leroy Brown - I could picture Freddie doing this song in a Vaudeville show. Great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />She Makes Me - the weakest song on the album by far. Brian's worst, in my opinion. 5/10 <br /> <br />In The Lap Of The Gods...Revisited - Great way to close the album. I prefer this one to In The Lap Of The Gods, although this gets a bit repetitive at the end. 8/10 <br /> <br />Overall this is a good album, definitely sets the stage for A Night At The Opera which was released one year later. Overall rating: 110/130
B00005JO04|5.0|\\"Syriana\\" is one of those seemingly long and boring films that has so many layers and subplots you have to really desire to see them all. It's one of those films you got to use your brain to fully appreciate it, it's no cheap entertainment. Most of good political thrillers are like this, and I'm really talking only about good ones.<br /><br />And I have to say \\"Syriana\\" is truly frightening picture. Well, we all know the world is run by a bunch of rich guys and a bunch of wannabe rich guys whose lack of funds is compensated by their connections and authority. But in a daily routine we usually forget about global problems and when reminded by means of films like \\"Syriana\\" it frightens. I feel a bit uneasy about living in such a world.<br /><br />It's useless to talk about the story line since it's very complex and consists of many layers as I already said. In a few words I can say the picture is about nowdays' political and economical situation in the world where everything is based on one thing - oil. Everyone is interested in it - big concerns hence big influential politicians hence big services like CIA. This vicious circle sucks in many people in \\"Syriana\\": idialistic Gulf prince and his family - emir father and soon-to-become-emir brother, a CIA life-beaten operative who has to eliminate the prince, a young oil-broker, who's into energetics, and his whole family which is rather far from all these problems, a corporate lawyer dealing with two major U.S. oil companies, and a Pakistani boy who's out of despair joins a radical islamic organization and is being prepared for a suicide bombing raid.<br /><br />Oil affects them all in some way spinning this story into a vortex of tragedies, deceptions, money and power. All these people playing roles of small particles in a giant engine have no idea that their every action will have a great impact on today's world, that their every word will have maybe fatal consequences. And since this story only pretends its characters and events are fictitious, it makes me rather sad - \\"Syriana\\" is a reminder we are living in a place everything is very far from being quiet and peaceful.<br /><br />\\"Syriana's\\" narration seems pretty ragged and that's for a reason. All its characters look like they don't have anything to do with each other and everyone has his own story. But if to look at the film from some distance it's getting clear they all are like small parts of a giant puzzle. Fitting together they form one big picture of today's world where they can't exist all by themselves. They depend on each other. But it's not like this at the first glance, so everything is not as it seems.<br /><br />\\"Syriana\\" is a great film, if you once started to watch it and stopped thinking it's boring (as many of those whom I know did), try one more time - it's indeed very thoughtful and actual. You'll be surprised you didn't make it through the first time.are fictitious, it makes me rather sad - \\"Syriana\\" is a reminder we are living in a place everything is very far from being quiet and peaceful.  <br />\\"Syriana's\\" narration seems pretty ragged and that's for a reason.

B0006L16N8|3.0|The recipe for Coldplay's massive commercial success with their \\"X&Y\\" album is simple--first, have some incredibly banal, faux-uplifting, lowest common denominator lyrics on hand; start the tune off with an atmospheric, drumless intro; then steadily build up to a 'big', 'anthemic', densely-produced chorus; end the song with a little outro to ease the listener out of the song.  Then, repeat the process until there's enough material to fill out a full album.  Oh, and give the album's first single--\\"Speed Of Sound\\"--an opening piano riff that's a virtual clone of the one from their previous smash hit \\"Clocks\\".    That's essentially what's going on here.  I'm not denying that the band has talent for nicely-produced, tuneful pop-rock songs that are sometimes even ear-catching.  The thing is though, these guys are trying to turn basically every song into some kind of soul-stirring anthem, and that's simply never going to happen with such consistently lame, obvious, witless, and crassly-calculated lyrics about how they will \\"try to fix you\\" and how \\"you don't have to be alone\\".  To put it another way, the 'hugeness' of the music is incompatible with the thinness of the lyrics, and it really gets to be disheartening by the end of the album.    I'll admit that Chris Martin's vocal delivery isn't BAD.  He does have a nice falsetto, and he knows how to use it effectively, sometimes when you're not expecting it.  Frankly, he even manages to beat Bono at his own game--Martin's vocals aren't nearly as pretentious and overblown as Bono's are. However, it's still laughable how Martin takes the shallow lyrics so damn seriously all the time as if they're high poetry--the melodically toothless intro on \\"Swallowed In The Sea\\" is the most eyeroll-inducing example of this.    Musically, the band does have talent.  Nice use of atmospherics, bass lines, and overtones help make the music highly listenable--their co-producers Danton Supple and Ken Nelson probably deserve at least some of thecredit for this.  The group also knows a thing or two about assimilating musical influences--they neatly weave Kraftwerk's \\"Computer Love\\" melody into \\"Talk\\" (the composers of the original \\"Computer Love\\" ARE credited here in the booklet); the bit before the chorus on \\"Speed Of Sound\\" instantly recalls \\"Running Up That Hill\\" by Kate Bush, another influence the band has openly admitted to.    The only way I can understand anyone thinking this album is a masterpiece is because they simply haven't listened to that much music.  I mean, it's 2006, folks.  This album, which came out in June of last year, really doesn't offer us anything musically that hadn't already been done, and with far better lyrics matched to it.  If you took a really talented lyricist and singer, a Jackson Browne for instance, and stuck him in front of Coldplay, the difference could be tremendous, supplying the group with an emotional center that it so desperately lacks.  As it is, the group remains stuck at, ahem, \\"Square One\\"--okay, okay, not THAT bad (sorry, I couldn't resist), but you get the idea.
B000E33VWW|5.0|All writers---even those of us on the lowest level of the totem pole---subject themselves to moments of intense reflection where the telling of the story from different emotional and rational vantage points simply overwhelms and neutralizes their real world existence.  The aspiration to endow a piece of writing with as much realism as possible equates to countless hours of research where the writer loses himself as he attempts to juxtapose facts from the concrete universe with those rare intermittent lightning strikes of artistic creation that are born in the Valhalla of imagination.  In certain circumstances, the experience plunges the writer into dangerous `heart of darkness' territory where his sentinels of morality shirk their duty and allow their charge to freefall, perhaps irrevocably jeopardizing the very soul desirous of immortality.<br /><br />In the 2005 biopic, \\"Capote,\\" director Bennett Miller focuses on this process and its repercussions by concentrating on five years in the life of the charismatic and unconventional Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as he germinates and brings to malevolent life a new genre of literature, the quintessential non-fiction true crime epitomized by his brainchild \\"In Cold Blood\\" published in 1966.<br /><br />From the opening sequences, we recognize Capote as an electro-magnet of social attention, reigning over raucous Holly Golightly-ish parties with a wavering lit cigarette while enjoying the sound of his own chalk-to-the-blackboard drawl dropping power names that appeared on the Who's Who list of that era with a Southern boy's charm of sounding not only intimate but just plain neighborly.  However, Miller quickly switches from the communal to the cerebral.  Piqued by a short article in the New York Times printed in November 1959, Capote tells New Yorker editor William Shawn (Bob Balaban) that he wishes to write an article exploring the impact of the brutal murder of the well-to-do Clutter family of Holcomb, Kansas on the small mid-western town and its sense of morality.  Accompanied by his research assistant, Nelle Harper Lee (of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" fame) (Catherine Keener), the eccentric Capote arrives in middle America, where all his blatant accrued New York verve puts him at odds with the less blaring local color.  Again, his gossipy social skills and his ability to reveal the darker aspects of his rather less than happy childhood allow him to burrow his idiosyncratic way into the homes and hearts of the town's inhabitants that will best help him appropriate the most exacting detail to fashion characters and circumstances for his thrilling and introspective account of the crime.<br /><br />Capote's manipulative skills wax diabolical once Capote sets eyes on Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr), one of the two ex-cons who perpetrated the crime.  Sensing that with his similar background and his need for recognition, Perry may indeed be the living representation of a darker Capote, Capote cannot help but empathizes with him.  He admits to Harper Lee that he feels as if they were both brought up in the same house, only that he, Capote, went out the front door while Perry went out the back.  As Capote is hell-bent to discover what really occurred in the Clutter house on that fall November evening to endow his non-fiction novel with as much gruesome reality as possible, he tries his darnedest to entrap Perry with the accoutrements of friendship---finding him a lawyer for his appeal, spoon-feeding him through a hunger strike and constantly visiting him for the duration of his prison stay.  As time goes on, however, Capote wishes only to finish the book.  The stays of execution that he helped perpetuate gum up his final vision and in spite of his obsession with his subject, he desperately desires only for the state of Kansas to put him and these criminals out of their misery.  The success of `In Cold Blood\\" speaks for itself, but the toll it takes on Capote is intimated by the film's printed after message noting Capote's descent into alcoholism and his inability to finish another book.<br /><br />On a purely theatrical level, the film's players succeed in bringing an intensely complex psychological study to life without a moment's boredom.  Amazingly, actor Hoffman visibly shrinks as Capote; his huge frame somehow manages to suggest the 5'4\\" literary dynamo and at the same time implies an aspect of decay not quite actively present during the depicted time period.  Instead, the viewer senses its initial metastasis beneath the surface like an erosion of ethical behavior attributed more blatantly to the visage of the figure in the attic portrait of Dorian Gray.  The lisping baby voice, the affected broken wrist gestures, the Southern drawl, the New York mannerisms all contribute to the illusion Hoffman successfully effectuates.  At first, these seem too theatrical even for Hoffman whose upper crust Freddy Miles in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" albeit true to character bordered on the obnoxious.  That is until the real Capote seems to take possession like a spirit inhabiting a medium.  Hoffman becomes Capote so much so that the viewer has difficulty distinguishing between the actor and subject.<br /><br />Bruce Greenwood, as Capote's long term partner and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee act as our human barometers, aiding us in accessing Capote's true intent while ferociously taking his story to its inevitable conclusion.  We watch them roll their eyes and exchange knowing glances and understand that on some level they perceive Capote's unraveling even before he does.  They exercise patience with Capote's genius and fully comprehend that the obsession that accompanies the hypo-manic personality can only fail on some lesser human plane.  Gravitating towards that dark place holds no sway with their far more contented souls.<br /><br />As Perry, Clifton Collins, Jr. smolders with dual natures both tender and repulsive.  The audience senses his desire for acknowledgement and then cringes when his eyes turn black with suspicion and inner rage for his own misfortunate fate.  The dark intensity of his inner visions acts as a perfect foil for Hoffman's pink and pouty relentlessness.  The two orbit around each other like the blue hot double star Sirius in a macabre dance of eclipsing yearning that drains the audience with almost as much ferocity as its two participants.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Director Bennett Miller constructs a fascinating two-hour study of the process an artist undergoes to give birth to his creation.  Exploring Capote's mind as it unearths the facts necessary to assemble \\"In Cold Blood\\" reveals that the selfishness, the desire for perfection, the condoning of deception and the necessity to retreat from the commonplace world that all writers on any level must endure exist in varying degrees in us all and unfortunately take their toll with our dealings in the real life arena of people and circumstance.

B000EGDC0A|5.0|Its a rarity that I become smitten with a cd from the get go. However, Supernature caught me and won't let go. Its in heavy rotation in my car and on my MP3. I feel like I should be cruising down the highway on a warm summer day with the top down on my convertible. Its sexy and fun and I totally recommend it if you are a fan of the song Strict Machine.
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|In one sentence: \\"The Longest Yard\\" is the Hollywood rendition of the video game \\"NFL Blitz\\" (2002/2003). <br /> <br />Heavy-hitting, off-the-top, not-to-be-taken-too-seriously, mean football but with a warm-spirited heart that is both fun to play in the game, or in the case of the movie -- to watch. <br /> <br />
B000002I53|5.0|Coltrane, Davis, Tyner, and Jones went into the studio for a week and came out with material for three albums.  \\"My Favorite Things\\" is the standards album.  \\"Coltrane's Sound\\" is the originals album (pretty good), and \\"Coltrane Plays The Blues\\" is the blues album. <br /> <br />The album starts with Coltrane's most public unveiling of the soprano sax.  It's a classic rendition, he takes something that seems lightweight and makes a classic jazz song out of it.  \\"Everytime We Say Goodbye\\" is a beautiful ballad, \\"Summertime\\" is perfect, and \\"But Not For Me\\" is great as well.  It's difficult to come with adjectives for the sort of classic album where you wouldn't change a note.  One of the best things about the album is that the bass is LOUD, and you can hear, and get lost in, Steve Davis' playing. <br /> <br />This was the first jazz album I got, and of course the first Coltrane, so I think it's better in the conventional, accesible, sense than \\"Giant Steps\\" or \\"A Love Supreme\\".  In other words, it's great for a non-jazz fan, as well as jazz fans.
0060934719|2.0|This is my first book by this author, and I honestly feel like I might like the story after-the-fact, if the author didn't ruin all the punchlines in the book. The fact that he felt the need to explain away every twist in the plot made me feel like I was being beat over the head with a \\"Did you get it?\\" stick. I also thought he was over-doing the fairytale theme, with the swirly chapter pages and obligatory detail that had zero quirks.
B0000DC14V|5.0|Malden seems to start true, but then turns out to be living a lie. He gets his come-uppance in the end. Marlon tells one lie after another, but slowly appears to be reaching down to the deeper truth. He gets away with it in the end. The basic theme of this film seems to be the clash of the misfit with society --- perhaps this is the underlying theme of all films, since they are told from the point of view of the individual; and society is composed of nothing but a bunch of conformist misfits. If you want to succeed in society, you have to fake it --- cover up your miss-spent youth, or put it behind you,  don a front of respectability, hide your flaws. This is the way society operates, and two-faced old Dad has it figured out. Only show the acceptable side of your face, and you've got it made. One of the best things about this movie is that Brando managed to kick Kubrick the cube off the set. Many of Kubrick's films show the individual being flattened by society's values: and the individual is often shown as being demented or vicious beyond redemption in the first place. Instead of the heavy-handed Kubrick treatment, Brando gives us a sensitive, nuanced, moody, brooding, highly romantic, subtle and poetic story which perfectly fits the locale and the Mexican Western genre. Brando is great, as nearly always in his earlier work: 80% languor and 20% explosion. Malden, as always, is nothing less than 110% professional. To be beautiful, however, you have to suffer; and, boy, does Brando suffer. You have to ask yourself if he finished up working for the government in Oregon, leaving nothing but a little memento South of the Border. With five hours and a million feet of film in the can, you also have to ask yourself about possible alternative endings. For instance, did Malden get in a deadly shot from behind the fountain? Or did he shoot the girl in the back, and kill the baby, before the couple made their getaway? That would have been just too audience unfriendly in 1961.I've now read pretty well most of the internet reviews of this movie, and the only one which halfway recognizes its power is the London Time Out piece by TM. Check it out, and you begin to get some idea of why OEJ is a great work. Time will tell. Its reputation can only grow.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam-Ten A Awesome start to one of the best bands ever!!!!!

B00004WEJZ|2.0|I don't know, I just can't consider this a true James Bond film.  It's not that Sean Connery is past his prime (which, for this type of role, he probably is); Roger Moore was a little long-in-the-tooth for at least his last couple of appearances as 007. It's not that the script is un-Bondish in any way.... stolen nuclear missiles in the hands of a madman employed by none other than the insidious terrorist organization SPECTRE.  It's simply that this movie was not produced by the same people responsible for the other Bond films and it shows. The movie is slow-moving and rather boring and discrepancies in well-established characters from the series leaps right out at you..... M is suddenly quite a bit younger than Bond, Felix Leiter has suddenly become a black man, and Q is, well, not Q.  There is, perhaps, some value in this film for an action adventure but it just doesn't fit in with the rest of the films. Contrast this movie with the other (TRUE) Bond film of 1983: Octopussy, and I think all this will be quite clear.

B000001E7V|5.0|Maxinquaye is definitely a breakthrough album--perhaps the Nevermind of trip hop. What's amazing about this CD, especially in the context of so many others in Tricky's catalogue, is that while it is able to maintain the uncompromising creative feel that is ubiquitous of Tricky in his first few albums (basically continuing up to Angels With Dirty Faces), this album is also pretty easy to access for most listeners. Other CDs Tricky has released, while often equally creative and hypnotic, are much harder to grasp for most people. So Maxinquaye makes a wonderful way for someone who is interested to cut their teeth on Tricky's ideas before jumping into something much more esoteric like Nearly God. What's also nice is that this album tends to explore multiple musical perspectives with an equal command of each one, going from up-tempo beats to hazy grooves fluidly. <br /> <br />Those looking for Portishead need not apply. Tricky's music, even Maxinquaye, is by default a bit more challenging than that of his contemporaries. But perhaps that's why it is so enjoyable: between his raspy vocal stylings and Martina Topley-Bird's gorgeous singing, wrapped in all of the dark grooves and sexy beats, is something magical that time cannot remove. If you're looking for something to inspire you and give you a truly intelligent interaction with your music, this is where it's at.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is so well done, so classy, so obviously a labor of love and respect and intelligent choices, that it is stunning to contemplate the lightly tapped well of talent in this man. While Harrison may not have been as fast-food prolific as the Lennon-McCartney duo, this tribute to a collection of his best work makes it inarguable that at his creative best, HE WAS THEIR PEER. He had the stuff, Mr. Ramon. I miss the collaborations that might have - ahem - taken Wings - but for ego, pride and condescension.

0375751513|2.0|While trying to start some kind of an aesthetic as well as a moral revolution, The Picture of Dorian Gray instead became a disappointment in the world of literature. I began reading this book upon the premise that it would contain fascinating worldviews, as well as a gripping plot. Rather, the book fell flat on its face. Wilde reflected his views of the importance of art, the pitfalls of beauty, and the horror of aging in this novel, and though it wasn't the views that were a problem, it was how they all contradicted one another. The author claimed, \\"all art is useless\\" in the preface of the novel, yet eventually it is art itself that becomes the bane of Dorian Gray's existence.<br /><br />The novel follows a young, beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, along with two of his friends, Basil, who paints a stunning picture of Dorian, and Harry, who leads Dorian into a world of lies, sin and betrayal. Though it starts off interestingly enough, the novel drags after the 50th page, and it only gets worse and worse until the very end. It is meant to shock its readers, with tales of murder and drugs, yet the writing isn't sophisticated enough to support these statements. The downward spiral of Dorian Gray's life is deserved, and the novel fails to leave the reader with a strong residual message. To its credit, however, the original premise was interesting, and the decay of Dorian Gray's existence and how he views himself makes for a decent plot.<br /><br />I will not bother to go into the details of the novel, for example the sexism and the portrayal of women in the book, and how it is questionable whether the characters are more in love with women, the idea of women, each other (yes, they are all male), or themselves. The homosexuality in the novel did not bother me, though the inaccurate portrayal of women did.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading about art, corruption or murder in the late 19th century in England, please, spare yourself the torture of reading Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages.Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages. <br />

I truly would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Daft Punk, Animated movies, or just good movies in general. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|I love this CD.  When I first recieved my friends and I were all listening to it.  All of the songs are good, but my favorites are definately numbers 1. It's like that, 5. Say Somthin', 6. Stay the Night, 7. Get your Number 10. Your Girl.  They are all pretty much up-beat and get you to wanna dance for sure.  Numbers 2. We belong together and 9. Circles are great love songs.  Something you listen to and absorb the words and melody. <br /> <br />I use to listen to Mariah when she first came out but quit about 6 years ago and just started picking her up again last year or so.  I'm glad I did, this cd is still one of my favorites.  She's always pretty much had her personal style and she still sticks with it, maybe just more \\"funk\\", which I like.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|As a lover of film noir, I was almost reluctant to see this film. It seems like the preoccupations of noir are outdated as far as the modern world is concerned. Well, I guess Sin City ain't the modern world.<br /><br />It gets both the style and the substance of noir, and tells real stories with the iconography. Sexual obsession as \\"love\\" and the idea of a man trying to redeem himself in the eyes of a woman who may or may not deserve it. And the dames themselves-- tough, smart and above all pragmatic. The movie is also a genuinely cynical, ambivalent meditation on the subject of corruption-- both personal and political. AND it's a green screen version of an old studio movie! --Actors walk on treadmills while the crew move things in front of the key light to get an interplay of light and shadow. John Alton would've been proud!

It's too bad Dre didn't have even a tighter beat. <br /> <br />This is a slept on classic by most. Probably Nas's second or third best album depending on your view.
B00000273M|4.0|The Bangles - Greatest Hits.  What can I say?  I really enjoyed this album.  Not only does it contain have my favourite tracks \\"Walk Like An Egyptian\\" and \\"Hazy Shade of Winter\\" but there were other tracks that, to be honest, I hadn't heard before but found them to be catchy all the same.  I rate this album alongside Belinda Carlisle's Greatest Hits - which I reckon is a great \\"road trip\\" album.  I unashamedly admit to liking a lot of 80s music - whether the lyrics make any sense or not, isn't the be all and end all - so the Bangles get my vote.
B00005NFL5|5.0|Usually I am not the type who likes dark, indeterminate, artsy movies -- I prefer to be entertained by a good story, quality comedy or satire. Had I read these reviews, I probably would have not chosen to view this film. However, not knowing what to expect, I found this one very engaging, gripping and more than a bit haunting. Increasingly repulsive, yet fascinating on a number of levels. There is less plot than in the visually-stunning \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" or beautiful muscial \\"Sweeney Todd,\\" (both highly recommended), but this similarly takes you deeper into the twisted psyche of a monstrous human being -- in this case, a repressed middle-aged, French classical piano teacher. Powerful images stayed with me long after viewing. It's a well-crafted, superbly-acted film on a very difficult, abstract subject. Highly recommended if you like looking into the darker layers of humanity, society and sexuality, without Hollywood's mandatory PC crap or in-your-face politicizing. The French may be pains-in-the butt in terms of international relations, but boy can they paint a twisted celluloid portrait. Excellent, but not a first-date movie!
B00030590I|4.0|I don't believe I have to register just to write this, but to those naysayers bashing this movie as Chinese propaganda: The message of this movie could have applied to ANY country. Instead of \\"All Under Heaven\\", or \\"All under the People's Republic of China\\", it could very well have been an American movie set in the Civil War echoing the cries of \\"All under the Union\\".  <br /> <br />But that's besides the point. IF it was propaganda, then EVERY character in this movie would have supported the Qin from the get go, but this is not the case with Maggie Cheung's character, who resisted the Qin right to the very end, until she takes her own life rather than live in the enemy regime. And Nameless' decision not to kill the emperor was a very humane one. What point was there? He knew it would have just spawned a whole new war with the next strongest faction vying for the Mandate of Heaven, and what we get is an endless cycle of violence in a divided China. (I doubt any of the other warring states were any less ruthless than the Qin either, just that Qin were more cunning) Human beings are not one dimensional characters who will stick to their beliefs indefinitely. Had Nameless killed the emperor, this movie would have degenerated into another one of those cheesy westernized version of a Chinese movie. Because of his humanity, his mercy, and his ultimate sacrifice, that's what makes him the hero of the movie. It's too bad some people here can't see that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />4/5 stars
B00005JO9J|5.0|There are very few regular TV shows that catch my attention.  I had always loved E.R., and since I work in the medical field, I thought I would give Grey's Anatomy a try. The very well-written shows never fail to keep me on the edge of my seat. I've grown to know all of the characters and look forward to seeing them all every week. Give it a try.....you'll get hooked!!
B000A1OG2W|3.0|I paid the extra cash for the added e.p. Cuttings, and hearing this after The Back Room opened up the original album much more. I then repeated a play of the Back Room, and within the slightly more textured sonic backgrounds added, the more spare settings of TBR became less harsh. There is a spartan quality to this bone-dry album mix; the vocals are a bit too similar across the board for emotion to really sink in to the atmosphere conjured. Still, the Joy Division/Echo & the Bunnymen comparisons show that, for a first album, that this band holds promise. I predict future releases will color in more shades to, as the photos here accurately show, a rather too-monochromatic effort. This works better in short doses. To my surprise, however, the grooves stuck far more persistently in my mind after hearing this than I'd have expected--a sign that Editors already have, behind a drab exterior, more subtle hues that I look forward to hearing in their next efforts. Not without imitation, yes, but I do also acknowledge that this band has the smarts, like their forebears, to progress into less stark, and more fertile, musical terrain.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is Back!!! American Life wasn't so good, but with Confessions, she proves that she is still number one. If you want non-stop dance music, this is the cd for you. You will not regret this soon to be classic from the Queen of Pop.
B00005S6K6|4.0|I found this film to be touching and for the most part, realistic. These are two basically honest married people who happen to have fallen in love. Very well done portrayals by DeNiro and Streep. They help to plug up a few obvious thin spots in the plot, and their inner torture really makes you feel for them both. If you enjoyed this movie and this subject matter, I highly recommend the 1945 classic British film, \\"Brief Encounter\\". I actually consider Falling in Love to be a re-make of this film, they are so similar. Brief Encounter is an extremely well-crafted and unusually constructed film. It is told to the viewer as a thought narrative by the woman imagining a full confession to her husband. I would give Brief Encounter five stars. This movie also served as the inspiration for another great film, \\"The Apartment\\".
B00004BZ0N|5.0|London Calling. I first heard this album my sophomore year in college and did not think too much of it. Then my roomate made me listen to it again and the light bulb went off. Not only is this the greatest Punk rock album ever recorded....this is arguably the greatest Rock album...PERIOD.<br /><br />I agree with everything everyone else says and it is all true. Before I heard this \\"Darkside of the Moon\\" ranked very high on my list as the best Rock album along with the all the Zeppelin classics. But what stood out about this album is how DIVERSE it is. The first Clash album is a fantastic Punk album and is what I pretty much expected from the band. (I still think \\"Nevermind the Bullocks...\\" is slightly better than \\"The Clash\\") But this album DESTROYS everything else.<br /><br />How this band had the ambition and foresight to make such an album astounds me. Not only did they make something completely different from their first two efforts but it is also a double LP. This was also the band's make or break effort. Making an album like this could have decimated the band's career because it is the direct opposite of all punk at that time...and yet it worked.<br /><br />What makes this record so special is how the bands virtually plays a different style of music on almost every track and YET is still in the Punk asthetic. There's Reggae, (\\"Guns of Brixton\\") Hard Rock (\\"Clampdown\\", \\"Death or Glory\\", quasi-disco (\\"Lost in the Supermarket\\") of course political joints, (\\"London Calling\\", \\"Spanish Bombs\\") hell...there's even rockabilly!! (\\"Brand New Cadiallac\\") And the pop hit (\\"Train in Vain\\"). This all sounds messy, even my review is messy but that is the same reason this record is so revered. No fear whatsoever, this band flat out put it down! The majority of the tracks even have horn sections!! (\\"Jimmy Jazz\\", \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\") A first in punk music.<br /><br />This album is the watershed of Punk...the greatest recording of the genre. Virtually every Punk band after has been influenced by this directly or indirectly. Don't expect to hear 3 chord songs played super fast. Rolling Stone (a magazine I personally hate) ranked this #8 in their 500 greatest. Go get this now. This is essential listening for anyone who claims to like Rock music. No wasted space on the record whatsoever, this album proved that Punk could be artistically challenging. Few double albums have no filler...and can be so rich and magnificent. \\"London Calling\\"...One of the best rock records I have ever heard.
B00004WG2F|5.0|I can't really fully explain the appeal of this film.  It is beautifully filmed, and the score is equally as beautiful.  The story is an epic, and epics are always inherently powerful, as time is everyone's enemy eventually.  It is the story of three brothers who love each other.  All are good men, as is their father, and as are the native americans who are given prominent and important roles.  Circumstances, not their failures, draw the brothers apart.  That is the tragedy in the film.   Anthony Hopkins plays the role of the father, and hits the part perfectly.  He is a man haunted by the horrors he has seen as a leader of men in warfare, and it is his failure to protect his sons from these horrors that sets the stage for the rest of the film.    Brad Pitt is great as Tristan, his father's favorite, a man whose unbridled enthusiasm for life does not come at the expense of his integrity.  Ultimately, his integrity is what both creates the tragedy and the very satisfying resolution for the story.  We end up liking and caring for all of the main characters in the film, and that makes for a very fine movie experience.
B0000019PA|5.0|The first time I heard this album, I was literally hooked from the first three seconds. The insanely catchy gutair strumming on the first track just tells your in for a treat.  <br />Throughout the 11 tracks of the disc you'll be treated to more wonderful guitar tunes, delightfully odd lyrics, and obscure solos that actually work (Bagpipes, anyone?). <br /> <br />Last week I listened to this album again, in it's entirety, and was still blown away completely. The last 3 tracks are the ones that really hit you hard. \\"Ghost\\" is a spirited track that builds up over the top with some of the most effective drumming I've heard. The next track, \\"10\\", is a wonderful instrumental that will get you jumping around dancing and feeling great. But the final track, \\"Two Headed Boy pt. 2\\" immediatly stops the innocent fun of the previous tracks. It's a very sad, slower version of \\"Two Headed Boy\\", and the last verse has some of the best lyrics on the album.  <br /> <br />This is my all-time second favorite album, right behind \\"Mellon Collie\\" by The Smashing Pumpkins. <br />If you don't enjoy this album you have no soul.
B00005JJX8|5.0|i don't know why it was so cheap, it's a fantastic Cary Grant/Grace Kelly Hitchcock thriller, and it has extras on the DVD, not just \\"subtitles on/off.\\"  Highly recommend it.
B00005JOE8|5.0|V for Vendetta is based upon a graphic novel by Alan Moore, which I was unaware of prior to seeing the film.  I cannot speak for the adaptation from the book but I found the film inspirational in that one understands the experiences from which the courage to face up to a totalitarian regime come from.  <br /> <br />The story begins some years in the not too distant future when England has been transformed into a Fascist state under the rule of a chancellor (played by John Hurt).  The United States is embroiled in a civil war (origin unknown).  The dictatorship (with overtones of Hitler) has a foot in Orwell's 1984 in describing a regime that has literally banned all freedoms but it struck me more that these are the hallmarks of all dictatorships: the cult of the leader, suppressing free speech, spying on their citizens.  The film centers on the mysterious character called \\"V,\\" who is part Zorro and Phantom of the Opera (in that he is disfigured) wearing a mask of Guy Fawkes (famed for the Gunpowder Plot during the reign of James I); he is an avenger and a liberator.  The pivotal character Evey (Rachael Portman) has suffered under the dictatorship with her parents (who protested against the regime) dying in labor camps and her brother dying as a result of biological weapon released by the government to instill fear.  The key part of the story is Evey's transformation from a fearful person, who bows to the dictatorship, into a defiant freedom fighter.   <br /> <br />However, Evey is not the only person affected by \\"V.\\"  After his initial act of defiance (blowing up the Old Bailey on Guy Fawkes' Day) all of the people are awakened into their own acts of defiance.   This is the focus of \\"V for Vendetta,\\" that power is with the people to produce change.  This is true throughout history from the American Revolution to the Orange Revolution.  After seeing the film I read the reviews of some film critics who believe the film is a jab at the Bush Administration.  Lately, several films have been exploited for a political message that I think is simply not there.  Even the \\"March of the Penguins\\" became a political football when it was held up as an example of \\"family values!\\"  One can read into \\"V for Vendetta\\" what one wishes but I do not see how it can be labeled as having an anti-Bush agenda.  The point of the film is that we all have a responsibility to hold our governments accountable for what they do, not just a single figure who has the courage to stand up; we all have to be ready to make sacrifices.  For me, this is a story of the triumph of the human spirit. <br /> <br />The casting is perfect on all levels.  Hugo Weaving rises to the challenge of acting behind a mask using his voice alone to bring depth to his character and Natalie Portman goes from a frightened young woman to being committed and fearless.  Stephen Rhea's Inspector Finch is an interesting everyman whose aim is to capture \\"V\\" but gradually understands the depths of the corrupt regime he is supporting, Stephen Fry has an excellent part as a television comedy show host who has much to hide and Tim Piggott-Smith is a superb villain.  Being a long-time fan of John Hurt it was enjoyable to see him again, especially since in the film of \\"1984\\" he was the victim of Big Brother. <br /> <br />I was drawn into the film from the start and the 132 minutes passed faster than I wanted, and I highly recommend it.   <br />
B00005JMJ4|5.0|For all those people out there who believe this film is just about the two stars being troubled because thier in another country is stupid. It is much more than that its about how the two stars share their troubles outside where they are they have a connection she is lost in her life she doesn't know if it will ever get better. and He is in a world where his wife doesn't seem to love him and his job had become a joke. They are both lost in life and they don't know if it will ever get better.This was a wonderful movie if you can relate to it. Superab acting!! This movie really was extodinary.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I put off seeing this film, unsure how the subject would be handled.    What a mistake!  This is absolutely one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is superbly acted - Heath Ledger puts forth the best acting I have ever seen, and I've seen plenty! Direction, music, cinematography - all amazing. It left me wrung out and haunted.  It portrays such an intense, palpable love, yet as I thought about it afterwards, I don't believe there is a single \\"I love you\\" uttered in the entire film.  Made me think about how talk is cheap! I am strictly a \\"renter\\" when it comes to movies, but I am buying this one because I know I'll want to see it many times. While some think that the the story ignores the pain of the families of the two men, or that their love is used as a justification of the pain they cause, I say \\"au contraire\\" - you've got it backwards!  The pain is deeply felt - however the CAUSE of the pain is NOT the relationship between the men. It is caused by a society where people are forced to deny their true feelings and are obligated to lead \\"acceptable\\" heterosexual lives.
B000006NXP|3.0|As I write this, there are 31 reviews ahead of me, all of them exuberant on Kleiber's interpretation. I cannot contest that. I must assume that all, or most, of the reviewers have listened to the music with the score in hand or have listened to 8 or 10 conductors who have read this music.  Theres hardly any mention of the sound quality of the recording, except one reviewer who says it is an early digital. The Penguin Guide - which I read after buying the CD from Amazon - puts it way down among the recommended recordings, noting that while any Kleiber recording is an event of stature, it admits that this early digital exposes its  technical limitations - \\"shrill and glassy\\" sounds above the  stave. I have many DG Originals with outstanding sound and outstanding performances. This disk is a great disappointment, even after hearing it several times. It certainly shouldnt be the beginner's first choice!
B000E33VWW|3.0|This is a rather boring movie, not just because of the deliberate moody  pace, but more because of the dated story and characterization.  Huffman delivers a cheesy portrayal of Capote.  In my opinion, the best actor for that role would have been Peter Lorre.  Overall, this movie is instantly forgetable - a really weak entry among the Oscar selections.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Ha sido anunciado en varias oportunidades como pronta salida comercial, esperamos y esperamos.... y seguimos sin novedades, hasta cuando sera la espera para tener este maravilloso filme en casa?????, gracias!!!!.
B000001FCB|5.0|I discovered this album because of the song, \\"Aguas De Marco.\\"  Each of the two artists is talented on his/her own; but, the combination is greater than the sum of its parts.    Elis Regina sings effortlessly, bringing authentic emotion to each song.  Her voice can be sexy, sad, joyful, and even playful.    Tom Jobim's voice and music complement Elis Regina.  Their music transports the listener back to a simpler time...even if that simplicity is mere illusion (i.e. 1974 wasn't a \\"simpler time\\").    PS--For those who like printed lyrics, this CD has all of the songs' lyrics in Portuguese, and they are all translated into English.
0060899190|4.0|The book was great! Just what I expected. Though it may be a \\"bathroom reader\\". Sitting down trying to read it novel-style is a bit exhausting.
B000BT97AO|5.0|I remember when I heard that Henson productions was coming out with something else I got a little worried.  How could they follow up Labyrinth?  The Dark Crystal?  The Storyteller?  Not to worry.  While this film doesn't resemble those other films, it is unique and captivating.  They manage to create another new world.  It's based on the art of Dave McKean and I was worried about that as well as his print stuff is incredible but I didn't know how it would work in 3-D.  It works great.  I felt like I was watching something *new*.  I highly recommed it.
B000BGH22W|1.0|I have to admit, when I learned that John Williams didn't do the score for this film, I felt a little weary about the quality of this new installment.  But having no expectations, I went into it very opened minded and willing to accept whatever new motifs, themes, and lyrical expressions Patrick Doyle had come up with.  Unfortunately, my assumptions were correct. <br /> <br />Cardinal rule when scoring films in a series, keep the principal themes.  This doesn't mean to \\"copy\\" the past installment's music.  No, that's not what it means.  It just means to include anchoring points that link subconsciously link this film to the past installments. <br />Now the reason why you DON'T take out established character's themes is because these themes are now subconsciously linked with their respective characters, it links each character to their state of being/presence, and as the characters develop and change throughout the series, they have their themes that change and develop along with them.  Now that doesn't mean whenever your scoring a cue for the scene involving the character you write a full out sonata featuring just their thematic motif, you work it in there creatively, find some way to subtly clue in the audience to something about that character with their theme (and it doesn't have to be used for EVERY cue a character is in, I'm just giving an example). <br /> <br />Patrick Doyle left out EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER'S theme (except for a crappy variation on Harry's).  Who knows exactly why he did it.  Maybe he didn't feel comfortable writing music that had bits and pieces of something another composer wrote, maybe he felt it would be cool to \\"do something drastically different.\\"  Whatever the reason, the result is obvious: this score is like the horrible film adaptation of a book.  Every director goes into it thinking they have a better idea than the original concept and every time it fails.  Patrick Doyle's concept contradicted every concept from the past original scores and completely ruined the feel of this movie.  This movie did not feel like a Harry Potter Film mainly because the music just wasn't there.  For example, when Lord Voldemort returns, for the first time, what do you think is missing?  His theme, it's completely gone, and in it's place there is no theme, not even a motif, just a melodic expression (which is completely different from a them). <br /> <br />Even though it's good that Patrick Doyle's music \\"matured as the content matured,\\" like I hear everyone saying, it doesn't excuse the fact that he did a bad job. Sorry to say, but anyone else who's had ANY experience actually scoring films in such a way to fit the emotional and characteristic feel of movies would have done a better job.  Just looking at the difference between the scores of HP and the Sorcerer's Stone and the Prisoner of Azkaban (I won't compare Chamb. of Secrets because J. Williams didn't do the whole score) you definitely sense a shift in the maturity of the themes.  Just that 3 note motif for Sirius was a step forward in character development, it shifts the whole feel of the film in another direction (though Book 3 still represents the characters as somewhat children, the big change in maturity wasn't until Book 4). <br /> <br />This score has no notable themes whatsoever except those variations of what John Williams wrote, and the variations sucked.  Don't get me wrong, some of the original cues that Mr. Doyle wrote were fantastic, but they did not fit this film.  It's a shame John Williams was scoring 4 films this year, because than he lost the chance to score the pivotal installment in the Harry Potter series, and it's a shame, and Patrick Doyle should be ashamed of himself, that such a lack-luster, brittle, and slovenly written score was written in Williams's stead.  If I could've have given this soundtrack 0 stars, (I mean, come on, rock songs?) I would have.
B00009TB5G|3.0|After getting through the extended version of Fellowship with no prior interest or knowlege of these films I felt I was prepared well enough for the long \\"Part II\\" of this series, The Two Towers. <br /> <br />Well, to be honest I was a little underwhelmed by this movie overall and it's long length started to make itself felt towards the end.  The first film was also long but I didn't \\"feel\\" that it was too long because it moved with more coherency and things unfolded more naturally.  This film jumped around a lot and that's OK as long as things are moving along nicely and the story advances during these scene jumps.  Too often, I felt that the individual stories in this film didn't really have anywhere to go or they took too long to get there.  It had points where it was truly getting dull... not too much but enough to notice it.  There were times that I found myself asking \\"where is this going?\\" or \\"this side-plot had better mean something really important to be dragging like this.\\"  Still, the movie did advance the story enough that it is worthwhile to see.  Just expect it to feel more dragged out than the first film. <br /> <br />Here is a summary: <br /> <br />GOOD: <br />- A few good twists and pot shake-ups that I liked.   <br />- Some of the new characters are pretty solid. <br />- Gollum got a good amount of screen time and I like him.... I even feel sorry for him sometimes! <br />- An epic battle at the end with some wild action. <br />- Solid effects and camera work as always! <br /> <br />BAD: <br />- Stupid side story with Merry, Pippin, & the \\"alive\\" trees.  The trees are cool and important but this side story received WAY too much screen time and was boring. <br />- More cases of characters that you think are dead/killed only to reappear later...dont want to spoil it so no names will be mentioned here! <br />- Frodo and Sam didnt gain much ground and did not get much screen time in this film.  They really didn't \\"do\\" very much. <br />- Movie felt a little long, unlike the first one. <br /> <br />OVERALL: <br /> <br />Certainly watchable and if you have the collection then you'll want this movie as well.  It's just not quite as good as the first one.
B000E5L8BG|1.0|it's actually painfull to see how placebo repeats everything they did in the past, but in a very enoying, uninspired way. If you have the first album, without you i'm nothing and black market music- you have more then enough. From there on placebo has nothing to say... I guess that's the tragedy of pop music.... <br /> <br />The production is awfull, Brian Molko doesn't sound pure at all and  the lyrics are so pretentious you really want to go back to the store and get you money back.. bad deal.
B000B19BCG|4.0|Hardly anyone in Australia has heard of Supergrass...it's a real shame because millions of people don't know what they're missing out on...nevertheless I was fortunate enough to hear their self-titled album one night two years ago when a band here threw in a Supergrass CD between sets...and I havent looked back.  <br /> <br />\\"Road to Rouen\\" sees a maturing of Supergrass. 'Tales Of Endurance (Parts 4, 5 & 6)',  'St. Petersburg' and 'Low C' are the elevated moments on this too-short album (9 songs is a bit of a rip-off, hence the 4 stars) that sees a musical development that was touched on with the previous 'Hollow Little Reign', 'Moving' and 'Prophet 15'. You'll be excused for thinking like I do that you're listening to a titivating rendition of \\"Abbey Road\\"...there is no mistaking it...it's very Beatleish but that's ok because it works without being tacky. It's low point is 'Coffee in the Pot\\" which sounds like it should be on a Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass album but Supergrass can get away with it becuase their music is so diverse...I just don't think many people will like it. Overall the album is good; very good. Now I just have to wait for the next one!
0684800713|5.0|My view would be how money played a big role in the novel
B00005JOE8|4.0|MOVIE: The story of V, the masked freedom fighter (or terrorist), is a dark vision of the future and how the government basically runs our lives. We have seen a recent lineup of films that take on this 1984 theme of Big Brother and we must overthrow it. If you remember the slightly enjoyable Equilibrium, and the recent Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet then you can see that this has been expressed in film already. However, with the Wachowskis helming the script we finally have a real intellectual look at the subject of a totalitarian government. The film takes place in Britain and is ruled by a dictator who is played by John Hurt (you know him as the guy from Alien who had his chest bursted open). V is the man who was betrayed and left for dead by the government and almost lost his life in a fire. Now he stands against his nation's leader by destroying government buildings and rounding up society to stand with him. He covers up his scarred body with a black caped outfit and a vaudevillian mask. Natalie Portman plays the supporting role who ends up seeing the world has V sees it. The film is very stylish and the dialogue is rich with meaning. I haven't read the graphic novel, so I cannot say if this interpretation is faithful the the comic character. But it's hard to find whose vision is being represented in the film, and that kind of makes the film a little unfocused at times. You have the original source material by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, the screenplay by the Wachowski's, and first time director James McTeigue. McTeigue was First Assistant Director on all three Matrix films, so it looks as if he is just being largely influenced by the Wachowski's. It basically feels like there are 5 directors, and not one straight vision. Hugo Weaving seals the movie with his sophisticated voice and really gives the character a reason for his motivation. It's an overall entertaining film with lots of ideas being expressed. The only thing is that these ideas have been expressed many times already in a variety of similar films.<br /><br />ACTING: Hugo Weaving (known as Agent Smith in the Matrix films) plays V, and he does a fantastic job even though we never see his face. He expresses his character's emotion through voice, and his voice is a perfect fit for the character. Natalie Portman basically becomes V's back support, and becomes more attracted to him and his goals throughout the film. She goes through a rebirth and sees the government the way V does, and basically fights alongside him. I have to mention though that her British accent was quite weak. John Hurt does a satisfactory job as the angry dictator. The cast does a fine job, but no standout performances.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: How does one man secretly manufacture and ship vaudevillian masks, black capes, and black hats to the entire population of England while the country is under a dicatorship and everything is run by the government? I don't know, but if you can get past some illogical plot holes and a familiar plot; the film itself is entertaining and enjoyable. It's well done, but it has inconsistant direction.

068987474X|4.0|While this book is cover to cover common sense, we've all known girlfriends with just too little of it when it comes to a relationship.      The book is a little repetative but very funny and full of situations you may be familiar with (hopefully through girlfriends, not your own experiences).    I read it in one sitting at the library.  A very quick and funny read.
B000E1ZBFY|3.0|Karol Wojtyla was deeply influenced by the events of the Second World War, or rather, the German invasion/occupation of his native Poland, to be more specific. That's the reason why this film is called what it is; as it tries to convey how the man himself was \\"made\\" by a particular historical era into the man the world has since come to know.   If you are looking for an all encompassing 'Life of John Paul II' this isn't the film for you. (See \\"Witness to Hope\\" on DVD for that, and/or read George Weigel's biography of Pope John Paul II by that same title.) Roughly half of this presentation concerns the era in which World War Two was fought, leaving not much time to address the half century of this man's service that followed. In many ways, thus, this film is very much a window into Nazi-occupied Poland; a film that one could usefully watch along with \\"The Wannsee Conference,\\" \\"Schindler's List,\\" and others. On that level it is a fine film indeed. Piotr Adamczyk, the actor who portays the future pope, moreover, handles the role with remarkable aplomb.   As the story of \\"The Man who became Pope,\\" however, this film suffers from some very serious shortcomings. In the film pivotal scenes, for instance, are portrayed by a \\"Father Tomasz Zaleski,\\" who plays Karol's close friend of many years---his spiritual advisor even; a man we ultimately see get shot by a Nazi firing squad. Too bad all this is, in George Weigel's words, \\"a complete invention. Young Karol Wojtyla did have a spiritual director, Father Kazimierz Figliewicz, but Figliewicz was not his contemporary and was not shot by the Germans, \\" Weigel has written. Karol's relationship with \\"Hania,\\" in real life the Polish actress Halina Krolikiewicz Kwiatkowska, is also doctored. A close friend of Karol, she is portrayed as kept in the dark by his decision to join the priesthood (seemingly belied by the fact that he was very open about this with friends supposedly); who then doesn't marry for 7 years---seemingly to imply something here.

1592401791|5.0|Other recent books about the Beatles,like Spitz's biography or Bramwell's gossip collection, had tended to be more about group politics than about the one thing that made the Beatles great: their music. In his book, Here There and Everywhere, Geoff Emerick, along with music journalist Howard Massey, correct this trend, presenting Beatles fans with a memoir of how the Beatles, along with the production team of George Martin and Geoff Emerick pushed the boundries of recording during act of creating the greatest music of the 20th century.<br /><br />Beginning as an extremely young boy, Emerick learns the ropes of recording according to EMI policies, which he shows are anti-intunitive and throttling. Using their financial clout, the Beatles override all sense about the technology, allowing Emerick to experiment in various dire ways, trying (and mostly suceeding) to please the Princes of Pop.  He is plainspoken about the musical deficiencies of the band, showing Paul McCartney to be the consummate music within the group. The rise of George Harrison from the fumbling guitarist who had his solos rerecorded by the ever more invented McCartney, to the writer of his later hits is one of the more interesting pieces of the book. Happily, Emerick is light on the Lennon/Ono debacle, although perforce by his observation of the recording studio during the White Album and Abbey Road session, we see how Lennon's new obsession ruined the band. Interestingly, the only verge into rancor is directed towards Ringo, who unforgivingly to Emerick, ruined the new Apple recording studios. Et tu, Rings?<br /><br />Having now read many many books on the Beatles, I can say that Emerick's memoir is among the best. Compare this book, if you will, with George Martin's two slight memoirs, and you may find yourself agreeing with me, especially if you want to know about the music, as opposed to the mayhem.
0425163407|2.0|It'll do if you just need to read something.  Kay Scarpetta has just about played out with me.  I'd like to read a book by Ms. Cornwell entitled \\"The Bloody Murder of Lucy\\" with this happening in the first paragraph.  This character elimination would delight me and I'd certainly buy that book.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Sounds like a typical Floyd record & then some!!  Great audio expressions & lyrics.  The instruments used (all the glasses filled to different levels w/water) filled out the sound very nicely.  A little short though... could have gone a little more instrumental crazy.  I know, I'm living in the past.  So be it, just buy the album.
B000301YY8|1.0|HIs voice.... one of the most unplesant noise, definitly top my cat scrathing a plastic surface.
B000BYRCGU|4.0|Into the Blue is not  intended to be a \\"serious\\" film produced with the conceit of competing for any prestigious movie awards. It is simply meant to be good pure fun. Just the fact that the likes of Alba and Walker, neither of whom will ever be accused of being accomplished thespians, should have shown the lack of artistic pretensions by the producers. Likewise, the fact that the characters are shown engaging in impossible tasks such as going deep underwater for long periods of time without any sort of air tank or other breathing apparatus. Also, the characters go directly from the sea floor to the surface without even so much as pausing to avoid getting the \\"bends\\" and sure enough they never get the bends. Anyone who is even vaguely familiar with swimming knows that such things are impossible. The presentation of impossible acts is meant to enliven the fun of the flick and, in that context, it works. <br /> <br />Into the Blue is set on the coast of an unspecified area in the Caribbean Sea. Walker is Jared who is more or less unemployed while Alba is Sam who is a shark handler at an amusement park. Together, they live in a dilapidated trailer whilst managing to have all sorts of expensive designer swim suits not to mention their very own boat.  <br /> <br />Soon, some folks who are new to the area enter the lives of Jared and Sam. One is a treasure hunter (Josh Brolin). Another is Jared's rich lawyer brother Bryce (Scott Caan) and his gal pal Amanda (Ashley Scott). Bryce has just come into possession of a local mansion courtesy of a drug dealer client who left the building, speed boat and jet ski as payment for legal services. They head off into the ocean looking for sunken treasure and as luck would have it, they find one of the biggest treasure troves of all time with hardly any bother.  <br /> <br />Shortly thereafter, they discover another trove 100 yards or so away that consists of a downed drug smuggler's plane loaded with cocaine. This discovery brings drugsmugglers into the picture. As a result, our heroes have to contend with both bringing the treasure to the surface while simultaneously fighting the evil drug lords. As is typical of such movies, our heroes never bother to contact law enforcement for strange and mysterious reasons never explained to the audience.  <br /> <br />Overall, Into the Blue offers lots of escapist fun in the sun. Add some action/adventure and some danger/violence with both drug runners and sharks, and you have yourself a whale of a popcorn flick. While the acting is highly suspect, the combination of a strong script and fantastic photography lift Into the Blue straight into the winner's category.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a Great Series!!! Superbly written stories that are not watered down by to many special effects.
B000E97HIA|4.0|While this may not be the Prince album so many seem to be wanting its still worth owning if you liked Musicology or funky sex related (which is pure Prince)material. Not a bad cd by any means. Times and music have changed so if your looking for another Purple Rain then stop listening to Prince altogether, he has moved on and so should everyone else that genuinly loves music. P is a funk master! <br /> <br />As for the review written by Danny the lover of all metal....why are you even comparing Prince to Tool or Slayer??????? You need to learn to be quiet about things that apparently arent your taste.
0446613444|2.0|This was my third Connelly novel (it's the second in the Bosch series), and I have to say reluctantly that it didn't work for me as well as the first two. At first I thought maybe I was just overdosed on his style, but on reflection I'm going to blame him and not me. <br /> <br />The plot moves police detective Harry Bosch back and forth between LA and Baja California -- and then back and forth uncountable times between the border towns of Mexicali and Calexico -- in his attempt to unravel the intricate (and stunningly implausible) story behind the suicide (or is it murder? or is it something else entirely?) of a fellow cop. I could never remember where I was in the story, literally or figuratively.  <br /> <br />The book is too long (and tedious) to read in a couple of sittings, but if you stretch it out you are going to need an index to find the threads of the story required to keep your place. There are too many characters, too many changes of scene, too many emotional complications, too many babes, too many business fronts and drug deals, even too many murders. I think that Connelly lost his balance in this, his second book. Fortunately I hear that he gets his game back again later, so I'm not going to give up on him. <br /> <br />If like me you are starting the Bosch series, and want to read the books in order, I'd advise just skipping this one. Wish I had; life's too short.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Ofcourse this is a film made before it's time.  The American people were not ready for such shocking truth in 2004.  However as time passes, some of those voices of hate and anger  at this film and it's truth telling will soon diminish.  Great insite into the the morning of 9-11 and why Bush did nothing with the warnings he received from his PDB's.  Why Norad stood down instead of following normal protocol...  Why the air traffic control tapes were destroyed...  The personal story of a lady who loved Bush had a military family and had a son who went to Iraq for Bush.  She later comes to grip with the death of her son and makes a 180 degree turn in her thoughts about war and Bush after not getting answers from the Pentagon.  Great insite as well into the thoughts of some of our young boys over there who have fun like a video game spraying down \\"ragheads\\".  I don't blame them, but it's the culture we have created of fear, hate, and ultra patriotism (jingoism).
B00005JOUM|4.0|After the disaster in 2004 that was \\"She Hate Me\\", Spike Lee is back in top form here with \\"Inside Man\\", a great thriller starring Denzel Washington (Training Day, Fallen) as Detective Keith Frazier who with Detective Bill Mitchell played by the always superb Chiwetel Ejiofor (Serenity, Four Brothers) go to a bank where Dalton Russell played by Clive Owen (Sin City, Croupier) is talking hostage. Why is he doing it? What does he want? Well, Denzel doesnt think it's a bank robbery. There's someone off about this particular robbery in which the money isnt even taking. During the film we see Denzel and Chiwetel talking to hostages that were in the building because Clivey Boy had every single hostage strip and put on painters suits and masks which the robbers were wearing as well so it would confuse the police. Christopher Plummer (Sound of Music, The New World) plays Arthur Case the bank owner who goes to Madeline White played by Jodie Foster (Silence of the Lambs, Flightplan) who still beautiful at her age. There is something within the bank that holds value to Plummer which if it gets out could probably ruin Plummer. Which is basically why Owen is in the bank in the first place. I dont wanna give away any more details just go see this great movie for yourselves. Denzel is back in top form. He hasnt made a movie since The Manchurian Candidate and he gives a blazing performance as usual. Clive Owen! Come on! This guy is the word \\"awesome\\". Hes a force to be reckoned here. He's brilliant. What was with the music Spike at the beginning and end? That song was kinda weird. Also starring the fantastic Willem Dafoe (Shadow of the Vampire, Boondock Saints), Kim Director (Blair Witch 2, Summer of Sam), Daryl \\"Chill\\" Mitchell (10 Things I Hate About You), Ken Leung (Keeping the Faith, Rush Hour) and Peter Frechette (Profiler, Grease 2). One of the best movies so far to come out this year, well that's what I think
B000002J27|4.0|When Peter Gabriel quit Genesis, he deprived the band of his powerful and unique voice, his often mind-blowing lyrics and his theatrics.  These were some of the defining aspects of early Genesis, and one might think that without them the band would fall apart (or at least lose quite a few of its fans.)<br /><br />Considering all this, \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" is a surprisingly strong effort.  Maybe it shouldn't be surprising; after all, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford wrote a lot of the melodies from the beginning, and as expected the songwriting on \\"Trick\\" is still (mostly) excellent.  Five of the eight songs are really great and full of exciting musical ideas.  The styles of these five songs are all quite different, from the super-proggy 7/4 time \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" to the short, poppy title track.  Most importantly, these songs are catchy and memorable, just like the songs of the Gabriel-era Genesis.<br /><br />However, \\"Trick\\" has a few flaws.  \\"Robbery, Assault and Battery\\" becomes a bit annoying after the two minute mark, and while Phil shows that he can do some decent character voices, it's no \\"Willow Farm\\". Likewise, \\"Mad Man Moon\\" is far too long, and I could do without the irritating faster middle section.  Not to mention that the main melody of \\"Moon\\" sounds a little too much like that of \\"Firth of Fifth\\".  At least Banks sticks to the piano throughout most of the song.  I also wonder why the guys thought they had to end the whole thing with a pointless instrumental reprise of the first seven songs (\\"Los Endos\\").<br /><br />Then there's the problem of the dominance of Tony Banks' keys on the album.  Excepting a few solos, I can't hear much of Steve Hackett's guitar at all.  When he does play, his guitar sounds so much like Tony's synths that I can't distinguish them.  Tony isn't quite smothering the songs with layer upon layer of murky synthtone yet, but it's easy to see how this leads to the following year's \\"Wind And Wuthering\\".  Yet this is a great album despite the production and a few weak points, although it never reaches the heights of \\"Foxtrot\\".t album despite the production and a few weak points, although it never reaches the heights of \\"Foxtrot\\".
B00005JOE8|4.0|Guy Fawkes tried to blow up the parlaiment many years back because it was corrupted. Swing to the future where people are being controlled by a \\"Hitler\\" type person played by John Hurt (Hellboy, Love and Death on Long Island) whos really an evil bugger in his role. People have a curfew. Evey played by Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer) gets mugged one night and thats when she is saved. Enter \\"V\\" played by Hugo Weaving (The Matrix Trilogy, Lord of the Rings Trilogy) a man who hides behind a mask...a Guy Fawkes mask. He sprouts poetry, rhymes and all sorts of good stuff. He's out to get parlaiment and well, do what Guy Fawkes didnt do all those years ago. Evey doesnt know if she can trust this guy because he manipulates with her. She finds out that \\"V\\" was part of a project that went horribly wrong and he was burned badly hence the wearing of the mask. The dynamic Stephen Rea (Interview with the Vampire, In Dreams) plays the dectective on the case looking to try to bring \\"V\\" down before he does any damage. Also starring Stephen Fry (Gosford Park, MirrorMask), Rupert Graves (Extreme Ops, Room To Rent), Sinead Cusack (Winter Solstice, Waterland) and Natasha Wightman (Revelation, Gosford Park). I'm sure a lot of people think this is aiming towards Bush and what not but I'm not big on politics so I just see it as an entertaining action packed joy ride from start to blazing finish filled with brilliant performances done by our main man Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman who releases herself from the druk that was Star Wars Revenge of the Sith last year. One of the best films that has come out this year. I recommend it highly
B000003S0I|5.0|Wow. This one might take a lot of listens to be comfortable with, but it's definitely worth the effort. In 1972, Robert Fripp must have decided he'd had enough of \\"Islands\\"-style directionless classical-rock noodling/cacophony, because \\"Larks' Tongues\\", recorded with a completely new band of highly professional musicians, is focused and hard-hitting. Former Yes drummer Bill Bruford really widens his scope on \\"Larks'\\" and plays like he never had before, John Wetton contributes his cool voice and great bass playing, violinist David Cross brings in an unexpected but effective element to the music, and mad percussionist Jamie Muir bangs and rattles away on everything in the studio that he can hit.<br /><br />Of course, at the center of the band stands Robert Fripp, who tears up \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic Parts One and Two\\" with the guitar he seemed to have forgotten about since recording \\"In The Wake Of Poseidon\\". The title track instrumentals are terrifically threatening, and although they might sound like random improv at first listen, they are actually well-constructed pieces. \\"The Talking Drum\\", which leads into \\"Larks' Tongues Part Two\\", is probably my favorite of the album; slowly building from a quiet drum-beat to a raging rocker with Bruford and Wetton holding down the piece, Fripp ripping away with his riffs and Cross swooping about with his violin.<br /><br />The remaining three tracks are actual songs, albeit with much jamming included. \\"Exiles\\" is a beautiful ballad, and while John Wetton can't beat Greg Lake at belting out such epic lines (but who can beat Greg Lake at this style?), he gives a great performance anyway. The playing is excellent as well. \\"Easy Money\\" steers more into rocking territory, with some aggressive vocals and a long mid-song guitar-led jam that doesn't get boring for one second (I especially like the part around 6:02 or so, although I couldn't tell you why.)  I can't forget to mention the funny sound effects throughout the song, which I guess are courtesy of Jamie Muir. Finally, \\"Book Of Saturday\\" is really quiet and unremarkable when compared with the rest of the album, but it's a nice ballad in any case.<br /><br />Despite all my praise, this really shouldn't be your first King Crimson record. One album reviewing website called \\"Larks' Tongues\\" \\"unfriendly music\\", and I don't think there's a better description for it. This album is cold, inaccessible and not inviting at all. You'd better go for \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\" or maybe \\"Red\\" first if you're not familiar with the band. If you find yourself loving these albums, however, don't hesitate to get this one. Listening to \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\" is quite a jarring experience, even after a hundred spins.esy of Jamie Muir.

B000AP2ZDK|5.0|This album is amazing....When i popped it into my computer, I loved every second of it....Here, Dilla takes inspiration from Madlib's sampling and chopping techniques, and uses it to create a true hiphop masterpiece.........THe tracks are blended together with numerous jazz and soul samples, and makes all the tracks 1-2 minutes long each.....Jay Dee, aka JDilla for most that do not know him, sadly passed away Friday early morning on Febuary 10th, 2006 due to heart complications from Lupis....3 days after the release of his new record 'Donuts' <br />His departure has a left a huge gaping hole in the hiphop world, and affected so many of his fans, and freinds, and loved one's. I admit, I just caught on to J-Dilla, and learned a lot from him when he was living, and even more shockingly after his untimely death. This album, I will NEVER forget, and I will cherish this forever......If you werent a fan before, well this album shows and defines what he is and what he stood for, a pioneer that was elevating hiphop to new heights, and became one of hiphop's biggest assets......he is the inspiration for today's producers, Kanye West, 9th Wonder, Dj Premier, and Pharell Williams.....without his influence, who knows where hiphop would be today.....Thank you Dilla, for sharing with the world for one last time,  a powerfull album that will be remembered for years and an album that will inspire the new wave of turntablists/Producers....Its very sad that the Innocent have to die first....James Yancey, aka JDilla was only 32, a short life span, but accomplised MANY, MANY things during that lifetime....He's served as producer for the hiphop group Slum Village, and produced for Common, Ghostface, and many others........Thank you again for gracing the world with your music, and thank you for putting out one last album in your career......RIP, Jay Dee aka JDilla
B00005K3NR|5.0|Unknown director Brian DePalma made a low budget horror movie based on a book by unknown writer Stephen King starring an unknown Sissy Spacek...and the rest is history.Enduring a horrible life at home with a religious nut for a mom and failing to fit in at school Carrie White has everything going against her until unexpectandly she gets an invite for the prom.But then things take a turn for the worse and Carrie's telekinetic powers are released.Spacek's vulnerable performance is perfect and Carrie is one of the best directed horror movies ever.Without giant special effects Brian DePalma crafts some great cinematic sequences like the agonizing slo-mo buildup to the prom diaster all the more painful to watch because you know Carrie's one true moment of joy will suddenly be cut short and will lead to tragedy.Unlike some classic horror films Carrie still stands the test of time because the themes are timeless.We all know what it's like to not fit in and at times  wish we can teach those that are bad to us a lesson .The slick T.V. remake is nowhere as good as the orginal,this is the only version to have.
B00008PW2D|4.0|The 5th Season of Sex and the City has a lot of really great story lines and works around the pregnancies of two of the actresses quite well, but the season is sadly only 8 episodes long, which kind of leaves you wondering why you had to pay so much for a season that was so very short! However, the character development was fabulous, especially with Cynthia Nixon's portrayal of Miranda as a new mother. I laughed, I felt sympathy, my jaw dropped in shock and occasional horror, and I feel that despite its brevity, Season 5 is just as good as the rest of them.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|I've seen over 130 movies of 2005, and Brokeback Mountain was clearly the BEST for me. This movie is groundbreaking, beautiful and incredibly haunting. I can't get this movie out of my head for an entire week after I saw this movie, and I was moved & touched so profoundly & deeply.    The acting of this movie was fabulous, Jake Gyllenhaal & Michelle Williams both did a great job, and Heath Ledger, all I can say is WOW! I never knew he was this amazing before I saw this movie.  His magnificent performance is miraculous. He seems to tear it from his insides, and he breathes his character so truthfully & brilliantly. His performance in this movie will be watched and admired for years to come as a landmark in acting. Bravo!    Another strength of this movie is the simplicity and strong symbolism of the way the story is told. The story-telling is so genuine, like the characters' feelings for one another, you won't realize how powerful it is at first. But by the conclusion, with its definitive, heart-wrenching portrayal of what will always be divided and what can never be, you will realize that the story has entered its souls.    The cinematography was mesmerizing, those images were so beautiful, and they just keep coming back to reassure you. The music score was also remarkable, and it captured the essence & emotion of the film flawlessly.    This adaptation stays true to the original short story and the two lead actors fit the roles perfectly. Solid work all around and with Ang Lee's vision, they have created an amazing piece of cinema that should not be missed by anybody. Kudos to the phenomenal director of this film - Ang Lee. Thank you so much for making this wonderful masterpiece.    This is a powerful movie that totally worth checking out. Besides, this film will live with you for a long, long time. As for me, it will live with me FOREVER!

0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton was a tenured Associate Professor of Anatomy at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine - but was deeply unhappy with his job and his life. He had begun his career as a cell biologist with great enthusiasm, excited to be working at the leading edge of science. However, he was totally stressed by having had to care for his father while he died of cancer, at the same time struggling to maintain his teaching schedule while writing grants to continue his research program, and dealing with an economically devastating divorce. He abruptly left to take a sabbatical to work in a medical school in the Caribbean.  <br /> <br />He became fascinated by the cooperation between the various plant and animal inhabitants of his island. Gradually he came to see that cooperation appeared to be the guiding pattern of nature, rather than competition, as Darwin had proposed and as had been taught within western science for decades. He published several papers confirming his alternative views of biology, showing that DNA was not the sole control mechanism for life processes, but then abandoned for good his position as a cellular biologist. <br /> <br />In a book that is peppered with wry humor, Lipton engagingly shares his understanding of the interconnectedness of the universe, building on theories derived from cellular biology, quantum physics, bioenergy medicine and plain old common sense.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended as an engaging as well as an informative read.

B0007PAMR4|5.0|Judging from the long list of previous reviews there is certainly a wide range of opinions, both good and bad, concerning this release of the theatrical and extended versions of 'Dune.'<br /><br />Personally, I'm delighted all the legal hassles have finally been resolved and the multitude of Dune fans can now enjoy this film whenever they want. Personally I enjoy the original theatrical version much more than the extended, but I also like to have the extra footage, being the obsessive completist that I am.<br /><br />Just enjoy it, the DVD containing the theatrical version has been OOP for some time now and now we have it available again along with the extended version in widescreen.<br /><br />REJOICE!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You know, when a show this fun, this creative, this funny, this brilliant can't even be allowed to survive a full season on television, it's about time to just unplug our TVs altogether.  Joss Whedon's only mistake, I suppose, was making a show that wasn't about surgeons, lawyers or cops.  Then maybe Firefly would have had a chance.  Maybe if he'd written another copycat crime drama that took itself too seriously, or some meaningless and mundane sitcom, he'd have had something that would go on for season after season.  But no, he made something really .... COOL is the word for it.  Quality.  Unique.  Heaven forbid the network powers-that-be would let that continue.<br /><br />Update October 2012: Going on many years now and still have not watched the FOX network since their shameful treatment of this series.  Yep, fans have long memories, and hold grudges. :)
0307276902|5.0|No matter all the controversy about what was true and what wasn't, Frey deserves credit for an incredibly insightful, daring, and creatively written piece of literature.  While reading A Million Little Pieces I was constantly sharing scenes from the book with my friends.  His language, although some may find offensive was very unique, and in all seriousness -what kind of recovering addict of his severity wouldn't ? Anyways- despite any fiction in the novel, Frey's work is one of a kind and should be highly commended, congratulated, and remembered.

0525948023|5.0|A New Earth is an excellent follow up to The Power of Now. It brings the stillness into the writing and gives clear insight to bringing Presence into what we do and how we live. It shows that our \\"purpose in life\\" is always secondary to Awakening and unless it is coming out of that place, it is more mind attempts to solve or control our \\"situation\\" and is doomed to fail. It expands on the Pain Body as a primary ill of humanity and shows how that too, can be awakened. This takes the opening of The Power of Now and gives a practical perspective on integrating it into daily life.

Many of the ideas contained in it are available in other works (people who have read any Gurdjieff or Ouspensky will recognize a lot of the thoughts, though that doesn't make them any the less worth hearing in this format...also, please read Gurdjieff, Ouspensky and their followers (e.g. Nicoll) if you haven't already).  At any rate, I think this book is an excellent, thoughtful, insightful work.  It will make you examine yourself and your life in many ways and can hardly help but improve it.   <br /> <br />

The chorus sounds alot like the batman theme tune and features some great harrison licks. <br /> <br />Ealenor rigby 11/10 written by paul macartney one of his best on the album witch he genrally dominates (songs that are credited lennon/macartney may be either one of the two they just wanted to share royalties) it has a haunting tune counterpointed by the strings playing in the background. It is melenconic and haunting very different to the beatles earlier work that was light hearted and cheery.  <br /> <br />Im only sleeping 11/10 written by lennon is a very soft soothing track very unlike ealenor rigby its very relaxing and lets your imagination flow.It features warm harmonies and nice melody lines a beatles classic that was never a single. <br /> <br />love you to 10/10 harrisons indian stylings turn out to be very convincing and this track shows how he is a very competent song writer. <br /> <br />Here There and everywhere 10/10 paul macartneys attempt to parodie the beach boys who he very much respected. Is simmilar to im only sleeping but much slower. There are warm harmonies and great vocal interplay between the members of the band. <br /> <br />yellow submarine 8/10 (written by paul macartney) this song is either one you love or hate. Its a good track ringos vocals are very out of tune but it works with in the song it has one of the catchiest choruses in pop music \\"we all live in a yellow submarine\\" <br /> <br />She said 10/10 (\\" \\" johnlennon) boosts from a great guitar riff and vocals from john lennon. its very much a straight pop song in my opinion. <br /> <br />Good day sunshine 9/10 ( \\" \\" paul macartney) a very upbeat track. is very reminsant of boogie its another example of the diversity of the beatles. <br /> <br />And your bird can sing 11?10 (\\" \\" john lennon) Starts off with some great country style guitar followed by great infecious pop melodies. <br /> <br />For no one 11/10 (\\" \\" paul macartney) this is a very uplifting track great tune one of paul macartneys most inspired. Features a great horn solo and a nice wistful tune. <br /> <br />Docter robert 9/10 (\\" \\" \\" lennon) starts off with a nice crisp riff with snappy chords.there is some of the best interplay between the beatles on the whole album there is some great harmonising between them. <br /> <br />I want to tell you 10/10 (\\" \\" goarge harrison) Very upbeat with some nice piano fills and and good riffery and big booming bass lines make this a very rocky number. <br /> <br />Got to get you into my life 11/10 ( \\" \\" macartney) Very sleezy and tongue in cheek but brilliant. The brass sections are incredibly catchy and paul macartney displays some his best vocal work. <br /> <br />Tomorrow knows (\\" \\" lennon) 8/10 sounds as if the backing is being fastfowarded its a great track very wierd and experimental but a very good track to close the album with
B000E8QVWY|5.0|<br />     I was so impressed with this movie when I saw the acing and the voices were amazing especially Johnny Cash.  I recommend this strongly to any Johnny Cashes fans they will not be dissapointed with the performances.  I am going to talk about the 1 disc dvd! <br /> <br />        IMAGE: <br />Now, here's the interesting thing about the picture quality.  Despite this movie being an important and popular release, the transfer is not quite up to Fox's usual high standards.  The colors are vibrant, but they can also look oversaturated at times and maybe a tad too bright for ultimate realism; the overall delineation is good but not great; the clarity is occasionally veiled by a touch of grain; and the general appearance is sometimes rough.  Put it another way; Fox's transfers are usually much cleaner,clearer, sharper and more natural than this.  Then again, maybe its just my eyes.  The picture quality is certainly adequate. <br /> <br />Sound: <br />The sound is in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1, the Dolby Digital 5.1 that I listened to being more than adequate for the occasion.  Indeed, it's excellent.  There is a very wide front-channel stero spread; terrific surround sound in the rear channels, immensely helpful in reproducing the ambient noises of live concerts; strong bass and transient response, and almost ideal clarity for midrange dialouge.  The result is an enjoyable listening experience all the way around. <br /> <br />Special Features: <br />On the single-disc edition that I watched, the major bous items are an audio commentary by co-writer and diretor James Mangold. On the main commentary, Mangold tells us the movie is about a man who got a second chance in life because he was blessed enough to be visited by an angel in the form of a really incredibly great woman.  The commentary is fun to watch. <br /> <br />There are also ten deleted scenes.  They last about twenty-three minutes and they are in anamorphic widescreeen. <br /> <br />Last, is a theatrical trailer and a soundtrack promo. <br /> <br />VIDEO: 7 stars out of 10. <br /> <br />Sound: 9 stars out of 10. <br /> <br />Special Features: 5 stars out of 10. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UAI|3.0|it is not devoid of its own strengths but this album lacks any real killer songs and includes the awful eight days a week. on this album there are some good songs that seem to of been rushed im a losers awkard arrangement in the chorus really dosnt compliment the song the verse of eight days a week by be catchy but it is little better than the worst of any era.there are a few songs worth hearing im a loser may have a shoddy arrangement but is a decent song babys in black is an upbeat very sixties sounded track witch sounds very much like country music.its worth listening to. No reply is also a standout although not as good as the bulk of their work it stands out as being better than alot of bands best songs.Ill follow the sun has a nice wistful tune i personally think this is one of the best on the album and one of the few tracks i belive worthy of the beatles catagory. There is also the brilliant what your doing witch also holds its head up high above the other tracks on this slightly below par beatles recording. dont want to spoil the part and every little thing are two songs witch also help to give the album some credibility. Another highlight is the cover of rock n roll music john lennons voice is overpower and it captures the essense of the song. heres a rating of each song <br /> <br />no reply 9/10 <br />im a loser 7/10 <br />babys in black 9/10 <br />rock and roll music 9/10 <br />ill follow the sun 9/10 <br />mr moonligh 3/10 <br />kansas city/heyheyhey[medly]5/10 <br />eight days a week 5/10 <br />words of love 7/10 <br />honey dont 5/10 <br />every little thing 7/10 <br />i dont want to spoil the party 7.5/10 <br />what your doing 10/10 <br />everybodys trying to be my baby 7/10
0689878451|1.0|I purchased this book, read it once, and promptly returned it. The book has one purpose - to advocate homosexual adoption. If as a parent, this is a message you want to express to your child, by all means buy the book. The message is not subtle; it is direct and is the only theme of the book. As a parent I feel that 6 years old is not an appropriate age to address the topic of same sex marriage and homosexual couple adoption.      I simply felt there was no value or purpose to the book other than the social message. If you're not purchasing the book solely for this message - skip the book. I did.
B000E97HIA|2.0|well where to start,i do believe some people must be paid to give those reviews,but i also believe some people that gave those reviews,don't like sign o the times,so there is the problem i am not askin the purple majesty to rehash old stuff but it is true,he lost the capability to craft good song's,the man is awfully desturbed and it shows,lack's inspiration and refuses to understand that he got both worlds workin his black and white side that is the main factor here,u the yes mam people will not make this record successful because sometimes u can not fool,hopefully he will soon wake up and truly be able to make music from his heart,t'il then i will put on the true records of his,and after all music is a matter of taste,but unfortunately my antenna is not in tune anymore with his output,to bad!!!!!!!!!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|After you've seen thousands of movies they start to get boring. It takes a lot to get a reaction out of you, and you notice you aren't startled or surprised when some \\"clever\\" director tries something new. That's where Oldboy comes in...<br /><br />This movie is awesome. The storyline and turn of events keep you interested the whole time. One of the best films I've seen recently, and would recommend it to anyone (over 18 that is... it is full of mature content after all). I have to give credit to the director here, his vision and art direction is all by itself.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Inspector: Deux-Deux, why do we see California Cool trashing David Gilmour. Deux-Deux: Inspector, he needs to stop bashing people who like Pink Floyd without Roger Waters and Rush(I dare him bash Rush if he had the guts). Inspector: This album is great. My favorites are Where We Start, the title cut, Castellorizon and Take a Breath. Deux-Deux: Si Inspector, those tracks are great and not to like this deserves being arrested! Inspector places anyone who gives this album one star under arrest for bad musical taste(like the last reviewer)!
006054094X|4.0|As you will see from the reviews below, either folks believe 100% in the book or deny it completely. I am going to choose a middle ground. This book clearly and undeniably proves the existance of maps which show the new world BEFORE columbus got there. Now did the Chinese discover the new world? Did the fleets truly circumnavigate the globe? Much debate on that, even now a map may have been found from 1418 which at least throws Menzies dates in question, that Zheng He too either had a guide map or sent out ships before the visits Gavin mentions in 1421-1423. <br />But one thing is clear, we shouldn't be celebrating Columbus Day in October in the US, we should celebrate at Most \\"Discovers Day\\" where the contributions of those before Columbus get acknowledged as well.
0321146530|4.0|Many other reviewers have, with some justification, bemoaned the crunchingly slow pace of this book.  Yes, the book moves through its examples slowly.  Yes, sometimes Beck's mock humility comes off more than a little snide.  It's not perfect on those counts, but please keep in mind that this is a book about a _process_, not a _result_. <br /> <br />The first example takes up almost half the book just to go through a pretty minimal implementation of a multi-currency representation for money.  If this were a book about how to implement money representations, it would be a dismal failure.  But of course, that's not the point at all -- the point is to use an example that's simple (so as not to be distracting), but just complex enough to produce adequate talking points to drive a discussion about test-driven development (TDD). <br /> <br />TDD is incredibly important, surprisingly late in arriving as a TLA unto itself, and Beck certainly gets points (cf. the review about \\"90% is just showing up\\") for producing a good straightforward introduction that's sorely needed.  Nobody's going to come away from this book feeling filled to the brim with facts and sophisticated techniques.  It's a short book (around 200 pages), and its pace is unhurried.  What it does is focus on _fundamentals_. <br /> <br />TDD is all about buyin -- once you \\"get religion\\" and become \\"test-infected\\" (per Gamma), you've got a solid basis to grow from.  It's about habits, and habits can be hard to teach.  What's obvious to one person is mysterious to the next.  Beck's approach of \\"sit here with me and listen to my thoughts on a simple, representative problem\\" is perfectly adequate.  It concedes (repeatedly) that some of the steps are obvious, but the pages quickly and one never feels truly bogged down.  He's really just teaching a handful of concepts throughout the whole book.  You could write the concepts in a single paragraph; that's how much real, critical information is here.  But it's _really good information_, and sometimes the key to grasping a fundamentally new (to you) viewpoint or idea is just hearing it rephrased for the 101st time, this time in words your brain is prepared to listen to. <br /> <br />So... it's a quick read, maybe a little pricey on that count.  I'd say buy it anyway, and recoup the investment by loaning it to others on your team.   <br /> <br />TDD is an incredibly beneficial infection; it's worth exposing yourself to a plainspoken explanation like this.  You'll probably know within 50 pages whether you agree.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|This movie is the best romantic comedy ever! I love Renee Zellweger as Bridget. To quote from another Zellweger film, she had me at \\"hello:\\" her drunken lip-synch at the beginning was so charming and real. It's great to finally see some heroines who have vices! Although the book was much different (especially concerning a major plot vehicle involving Mrs. Jones and her quasi-lover Julien), I though the differences made for a great movie. It's like getting two versions of Bridget's life, each one sweet, funny and naughty. This movie is so real (down to a sexy but very wrinkled shirt that Bridget wears to work) and charming, I had to rent the requel immediately!
B000E1KN5W|5.0|This extremely well digitally remastered version of Court in a beautifully designed mini-lp sleeve replica package is a real treat for Crimson fans. Not only has the sound been remastered to perfection but the liner notes are also very well designed with lyrics and paper clippings harking to the old days included to boot. I thought the 30th Anniversary version was great but if you can believe it, this version is much better.  The sound quality is excellent and makes the 30th Anniversary version sound mediocre in comparison.  For want of a better definition and to satisfy those that absolutely have to categorise everything that they hear, this would be the godfather of the progressive rock genre. To call it the progenitor of progressive rock would be misleading and incorrect as depending upon how you think about it, even Sgt Pepper's, Velvet Underground's first album and Pink Floyd's Sid Barrett days could all be called progressive rock but still this album is a work of art on it's own and is deserving of all the accolades that it has received to date and continues to receive today. Great opening powerhouse track followed by more mellow Moody Blues-like stuff and ending on a powerful note. Essential listening for music hobbyists and a recording that is seminal and really grows on you. Recommended.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|While I'm not happy with how long its taken to get out.. I did download it way back in september becasue the wait was too long. Its a very beautiful and artistic peice. Not everyone will get it or love it and thats sad.  <br /> <br />Since many people like and many people don't I highly suggest that if you can you rent it before you buy it, or even download it, but warning.. when you download the movie it will 99% of the time be in japanese with subtitles. Otherwise I suggest you buy it!
B00006DEFA|5.0|As a cellist, I love Mozart so this is decidedly a biased review. The scoring and sound quality of this movie is excellent given the year it was produced. The acting is very good and moves one to tears. Even my stoic 15 year old son finds the movie to be engaging and moving. I think it is also a decent portrayal Amadeus Mozart's life... although it mostly focuses on his final years. A good sound system is essential to really losing yourself in this movie. Make the whole family watch too!
6305718954|5.0|As much as this movie is meant to be derogatory to the Catholic religion, it is also a compelling and thought-provoking work. <br />The soundtrack is just as electric as the subject itself. <br />It is an amazing story with a unique approach. Stunning with its message of faith that comes from the absence of faith in an unbeliever who is transformed so completely.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|Just saw him in concert at the 930 club and he was great.  I was waiting and waiting for this cd to come out and I'm so happy to have it my hands.  I love Rob Zombie and this is great.  I agree it is a little different, but it has a fresh new feel yet still the same Rob Zombie.  I can't wait to rock this cd out!  Def go to the store right now and pick it up!  you won't be let down
B000EJ9VUW|5.0|Liars seem to be characterized ultimately by their extreme boldness within their own musical environment.  On They Threw Us All In A Trench And Stuck A Monument On Top they showed up as inovators of what one could call a very short lived period of dance punk, which seemed to morph pretty quickly into a much less experimental pop phenomeon with groups like Bloc Party and what have you. <br /> <br />              But immediately following the great success of this album they fired their rhythm section (who have since become the group No Things, who sound much more like that first album than either of these second two Liars albums).  It was an incredible bold move, and one that made the unfaithful very wary and hateful of their second album, They Were Wrong So We Drowned. <br /> <br />               However, with Drum's Not Dead, the Liars sound seems to be congealing (hopefully not too much, i'm quite enjoying their erratic career so far) into something that can stand on its own without the context of their previous two records.  Drum's is probably more similar in aesthetic to Drowned than Monument, but it definately stands on its own, and seems to be a step forward in a relatively similar direction. <br /> <br />             There is definitely a tribal element to their rhythms on this album, and I can see some similarities to Animal Collective in their use of tons of congos and some Black Dice like drum effects.  While many of the tracks have a driving rhythm, overall its too dark to be dancable like their first, but will get your head bobbing nonetheless. <br /> <br />            The album flows as one cohesive musical piece, each track bleeding into the next, but not to a point where it all seems like one song.  Lastly, the DVD full of 3 entire low budget video versions of the whole album is an amazing bonus.  The video's are very fitting to the music, and the live footage in the studio is very fun to watch with the songs.  One of my absolute favorite recent albums, pick it up for sure.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I did not want to see the movie after having read some of the critics reviews but my brother who noticed I was still playing an old cassette of the original soundtrack told me that it was a very good movie and that I shouldn't be afraid of being disappointed.  So I purchased the DVD and I am glad to report that it was money well spent. Never having seen the original, but having imagined the entire thing in my  head from the soundtrack, I was only slightly disappointed the first time I saw it since I still missed the voice and style of Michael Crawford.  But after the second viewing, I realized how much I liked Gerald Butler's phantom and thought Christine a wonderful singer and a lovely girl. The entire cast was excellent and the visuals extremely well done.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B000EGDC14|5.0|This is a great CD from Goldfrapp. I've been a fan since they came out in 2000 with FELT MOUNTAIN. I also really enjoyed their 2003 album BLACK CHERRY. In many ways, SUPERNATURE is a combination of the two albums, filled with some chillout tracks, and some electro-disco numbers that will get you moving on the dancefloor! The first single \\"Oooh La La\\" is a perfect example, same goes for the other singles \\"Number 1\\" and \\"Ride A White Horse\\", the latter being my favorite. Other highlights include \\"Slide In\\", \\"Time Away From The World\\", \\"Satin Chic\\", overall really the whole album is stellar!
B000DZIGDU|1.0|Sorry, but I cannot give this film a fair objective evaluation because it hit me personally as a former Marine of 8 years and current Air Force Reservist of 9 years, and also as an OEF/OIF combat zone veteran.  So unfortunately I will have to state my opinion and fall into the ranks of the other evaluators whose reviews are voted on according to social poularity contests and not according to the actual content of the reviews.  But it's okay...I can live with 0 helpful votes out of 26 reviews! <br /> <br />I watched Jarhead for the first time yesterday.  My stint in the Corps lasted from 1986 to 1994 and I spent plenty of time living in open squad bays, two-man \\"hooches,\\" GP tents with all kinds of Marines from 0311 grunts and 9th Recon Marines to pencil pushing office pogues in a variety of countries and secluded, tense conditions.  Of all the personalities I was exposed to and all the practical jokes, mind games and stress releaving activities, I can honestly say that I never ran across such sustained extremes of group behavior with such complete disregard for the UCMJ and the safety of fellow Marines. <br /> <br />The opening scenes of Jarhead are less than convincing as the main character is harrassed by a drill instructor who somehow manages to get away with sporting a moustache.  Small detail but an inaccurate one, from any of the USMC drill instructors I ever saw.  The actor appears to try desperately to follow in the foot steps of R. Lee Ermey of The Boys in Company C, Full Metal Jacket, Mail Call and the real U.S. Marine Corps.  The behavior is not far off the mark (as any bruised-up Third Battalion Parris Island recuit can tell you) but the acting is not quite convincing. <br /> <br />Throughout the movie the main character whines and moans about what a raw deal life has given him, and he frequently throws childish temper tantrums.  If these were the actual real-life antics of this \\"Marine\\" then it surprises me that boot camp did not successfully weed him out or that he was not eventually sent home with a Section 8 or Bad Conduct Discharge.  And yes, there WAS a designated way to deal with psychological issues: it was called the Chain of Command/Company First Sergeant, Chaplain's Office (or tent in combat zones), Consolidated Substance Abuse Control Center, Family Advocacy, and the Base Psychiatrist.  These and other resources were no mystery to any Marine during that era.  <br /> <br />Not withstanding the over-exagerrated and almost mindless depiction of Marines (I assure you they are neither that ignorant, lawless, savage or ill-prepared, either as far back as the first Gulf War or today) Jarhead seems to entertain the basic idea of the meaning of life, somewhat along the same vein as The Thin Red Line and Apocalypse Now though approached from its own unique perspective.  The character struggles with why he ever came into the Corps in the first place, cannot understand why he does not fit in, and grapples with the gnawing agony of wanting to make his mark in life.  God knows that any Marine worth his salt can identify with the frustration of being restrained from doing what he or she was trained to do.  It seems to be on this level where Jarhead earns points with those who give it higher ratings: it taps into the rudimentary psyche of almost every living human being.  \\"Why am I here?  What is it all worth?  Will my existence count?\\"  As a \\"war film\\" or documentary of the Marine Corps military subculture, however, Jarhead is WAY off track.  Overall, this is a film that poses questions with no answers and provokes self-evaluation.  Aside from that, it is only Hollywood and the rantings of an off-balance, almost criminally insane little non-hacking snot who completely missed the whole idea of what Marines are and why they do what they do.  That's my first-hand experience. <br /> <br />Honor, integrity, valor, self-control, service before self... <br /> <br />Semper Fi.  <br /> <br />
B0000025C0|4.0|How does a band follow the greatest selling debut album in history and avoid becoming a \\"One Hit Wonder\\"? It's done by releasing another solid album which stands on its own to this day.  <br /> <br />BOSTON's self-titled debut was an absolute smash and hit the music world by surprise in 1976, but 1978's Don't Look Back is a worthy album in its own right. Building off of their first album and the sound which continues to inspire, Don't Look Back had many hits including `Don't Look Back', `A Man I'll Never Be', and `Feelin' Satisfied'. <br /> <br />The lineup was headed by lead guitarist and musical mastermind, Tom Scholz, an MIT graduate whose hobby as a guitar player turned into an obsession. An avid perfectionist in the studio, Scholz meticulously harmonized instruments as much as he could, sometimes having two or three guitars playing the same lick. In addition, the pure Rock vocals of Brad Delp were the perfect compliment to Scholz guitar work. The rest of the lineup was rounded out by Barry Goudreau on rhythm guitar, Fran Sheenan on bass, and the versatile Sib Hashian on drums. <br /> <br />Don't Look Back's first track `Don't Look Back' is clearly the best song on the album. It showcases every aspect of BOSTON's sound from start to finish. The signature driving opening riff leads into a more melodic verse, which leads to a sharp chorus that features Scholz and Goudreau's double melodic guitar licks. Delp's ability to hit harmonies on command gives Goosebumps during the song's final climactic chorus. <br /> <br />`The Journey' is an eerie instrumental which leads very nicely to the easy rocking `It's Easy', which is a lighter song that's not centered on specific riffs such as `Don't Look Back', but nicely showcases Scholz's improvisational skils. <br /> <br />The A-side is rounded out by the ballad, `A Man I'll Never Be', which is a soft but solid track that is once again centered ar <br />ound a double guitar riff, which almost acts like a chorus in itself. Again Delp's creamy vocals are incredible as he puts all of his emotion into his voice. <br /> <br />Being pressed by their record label, Epic, Scholz felt rushed in creating the album and admits that it wasn't the perfection that he had hoped for. Ultimately this perfection cost BOSTON as their next albums took many years to produce and suffered in record sales. It's worth saying that the B-Side has a couple of good tracks such as `Feelin' Satisfied' and `Party' and is rounded out by minor songs `Used to Bad News' and `Don't Be Afraid'. However, some of these B-sides closely resembled tracks on BOSTON's first album and cause some to argue that this album is just the same formula repeated over again. This clearly is not the case for the whole album as BOSTON expanded the melodic sound that they originated in '76, and created a monster A-side, which arguably rivals BOSTON's first album. <br /> <br />Overall, Don't Look Back was a very strong follow up effort for BOSTON in 1978 and cemented their status as a staple in rock history. As mentioned above, the A-side is phenomenal, with about 20 minutes of Tom Scholz finest guitar work and the best of Brad Delp on vocals. It is truly an album which stands on its own, even though it will forever be in the shadow of BOSTON's 1976 debut.
B000A2WF3S|5.0|According an almost genetic tradition, there has not been any other instrument so closely associated with Jewish musicians. Szigetti, Heifetz, Stern, Menuhin, Morini, Rabin, Gitlis, Perlman, Vengerov and Zukerman among others seem to confirm it. Gideon Kremer virtuosity would seem to run parallel to its humbleness. He is far to be a star of the instrument; he has always known to maintain a low profile, even every time he decides to make a public appearance or to record determined work, it' s an issue of constant attention by many musical followers of his art.<br /><br />  Gidon Kremer made of this special recoding a cult performance in all the sense of the word. His impeccable phrasing and fabulous technique have credited him as one of the most legendary interpreters of this instrument.<br /><br />Go for this record. It will reward you.
B0000024SD|5.0|If you think the title of my review is totally random and came out of nowhere, you've obviously never heard Subterranean Homesick Blues. Thankfully, we can fix that. How? BUY THIS ALBUM!<br /><br />If your image of Dylan is a guy with an acoustic guitar and harmonica (in other words, the image on my Dylan t-shirt), this LP will prove it wrong. Hilarious, surreal rockers such as Subterranean Homesick Blues, Maggie's Farm, On the Road Again and Bob Dylan's 115th Dream dominate the legendary first side of this LP. And if you think Side 1 was good (even though it was), hang onto your hat and give the acoustic second half a spin. It will change your image of folk music forever. After all, since when were folkies spitting out verses such as \\"Upon four-legged forest clouds, the cowboy angel rides\\" or \\"And if my thought-dreams could be seen, they'd probably put my head in a guillotine...but it's all right ma, that's life and life only\\"? (from Gates of Eden and It's Alright Ma, respectively). And then there's It's All Over Now Baby Blue, a beautiful song, at least at face value. But listen closer...pretty dark, no? And of course you've heard Mr. Tambourine Man. If you're tired of the Byrds' butchered version, LISTEN TO THIS ONE!! Certainly among rock's finest drug-songs!<br /><br />BUY BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME!!!
B00003BDXG|3.0|The well known generated controversy around this very special movie aroused extreme commentaries around the world. Oliver Stone built a provocative and corrosive parody around a couple absolutely surrounded by a sick violence atmosphere.<br /><br />To my mind there were just two premises that visibly affected his final purposes; a marked excess of personal ambition and narcissist self tribute (after all who can deny his absolute domain around his discursive lexicon shown in JFK for instance), loading the screen of vertiginous visual innovations which resulted quite effective during the first ten minutes, but absolutely pernicious due the reiterative abuse of those sensationalist devices; on the other hand Stone also incurred into the orgiastic and bombastic flow he pretended to underline, being eventually dragged by this frenetic burden of violence which pitifully became a boomerang for him.<br /><br />All the unjustified excesses eventually, reflect a certain lack of discursive material.
B000002UYZ|4.0|Like so many other Beatles fans born after their breakup (multiple decades, in my case), this is where I was first exposed to the Beatles.  My parents owned (and still own) a vynil copy of this, and I remember listening to it obsessively, constantly replaying tracks such as Please Please Me, Can't Buy Me Love (that particular band of the vynil is probably worn out by now!) and Drive My Car. And then I used to sing Beatles songs at school, which would often earn me stares from several fans of MTV. Shortly after, I blew most of my hard-earned money on Beatles CD's. Sorry...<br />Anyway, the music...OF COURSE IT'S GOOD! OK, maybe All My Loving is very skippable...and Revolver was DEFINITELY under-represented. (TWO cuts? Gimme a break!!!) However there are so many GREAT songs on this collection, it should be bought by any music fan!!!!
B00005JO20|4.0|you could believe there was some feeling between the girl and primate. Never love, that was always weird. Great action, except for a buggy, sluggy interlude that is way too long. And the ice was dumb. But otherwise a good action flick.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Of course I'm a fam, and yes I am giving it two very enthusiastic thumbs up! The Man has definitely gone through it all and back again. I especially like the bluesy Satisified. If you are looking for typical Prince, then this is it. He has never disappointed his loyal friends. If you are a TRUE fam, then you know that Prince is ALWAYS ahead of the curve when it comes to music. Think about it, 1999 was 15 years ahead of its time-all of Prince's music is. So those of you who think this album is boring, buy it in about 20 years and see if it isn't right for the time.
B000E33VWW|5.0|`capote', the biopic of a few years in the life of novelist and short story writer, Truman Capote, directed by Bennett Miller, and starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman, for which he won the Best Actor Academy Award, is very much of an `insider's movie with strong influences from it's primary subject, Capote's `nonfiction novel', `In Cold Blood'.<br /><br />For starters, the director and writer, Dan Futterman, take a very minimalist approach to their subject. For a film about a writer, there seem to be remarkably few words spoken in the script. This may have been a big mistake for the sake of many viewers. Even though my mother lived through Capote's height of celebrity with many appearances on the talk show circuit, she was totally unfamiliar with what he had written, even though she was quite familiar with both the magazine `The New Yorker' and the novel and movie, `Breakfast at Tiffany's' for which Capote was most famous before `In Cold Blood'. Even if you knew of Capote, or at least knew more of his reputation than the Kansas locals he met at the outset of his research into the book, you may have had trouble identifying the other major literary characters appearing briefly on the screen, such as Harper Lee, the author of `To Kill a Mockingbird' and Capote's assistant on his trips to Kansas, Bill Shawn (played by Bob Balaban), the Editor in Chief of `The New Yorker', and Richard Avedon, the extremely talented and influential fashion photographer who, until his recent death, did almost all the photographs for `The New Yorker'. The role of Capote's companion who we meet only through telephone conversations between he and Capote, is even more subtle, as this individual could easily be either Capote's agent or simply a colleague.<br /><br />This movie seems to me to be extremely similar in style to the recent Coppola / Bill Murray film, `Lost in Translation', which also has sparse dialogue and very little character development. That is not to say there is no significant character development in `capote', especially on the part of Capote himself. The perps of the Clutter murders had a profound effect on Capote, expecially Perry Smith, the more articulate of the two. And yet, in spite of the fact that Capote's interest in the case was to some extent responsible for various stays of execution and improved legal representation, Capote always put completing his book ahead of their fates. As Hoffman and Miller state in some of the commentary, Capote wanted them to be executed not so much because they were guilty as because it would enable to wrap up the story of his book.<br /><br />The DVD package includes my favorite special feature, that is, voiceover commentaries by the director and star and the director and cinematographer. In my experience, this is the only extra which is often worth troubling with, expecially in a movie with such a narrow focus. All the `making of' featurettes often simply repeat what you get first hand in the comments, unless it happens to be a special effects action fest where you need the specialist's point of view on how, for example, Andy Serkis did Gollum or King Kong.<br /><br />The very best thing about this movie is Hoffman's portrayal of Capote, which is probably only really interesting if you happen to have seen him on TV or know a lot about his work. I have the feeling that aside from major cinema fans, this movie may be lost on the average movie audience used to the richness in George Lucas / Stephen Spielberg / Peter Jackson ourves.<br /><br />The fact is, I enjoyed this movie a lot, but that is probably because I am well versed in the history of both the author, `The New Yorker', Capote's connection to the magazine, and his connection to this crime.nt character development in `capote', especially on the part of Capote himself.

B000BTJDGC|4.0|I was eagerly waiting for this movie to come out, I have heard the case of the German Girl Annliese Michel, first from Ed and Lorraine Warren and then from Ralph Sarchie.  This was a very good movie.  I personnaly don't consider this movie better than the Exorcist, as of yet there has been NO movie at all to outdue themselves, until this day I have to watch the Exorcist in the day time.  I didn't find it scary as the reviews, or from people saying how they couldn't sleep after watching the movie.  It was good but not scary. <br /> <br />
0156012197|5.0|A neat book to give as a gift for a gifted student.
0553579908|4.0|Where as the first book seemed to center on the political intrigue, this ones brings in more of the fantasy elements to set up the stage for magic and dragons. Mr. Martin still keeps his elements of pain and torture as in the first book where you many of the characters get disillusioned with life and to suffer through the events that unfold. It feels like he is telling the reader, life is unfair, get used to it.<br /><br />If you liked the first one, then this one is sure to please. The characters are rich and multidimensional. The plot is deep and twisted. This reader is caught and just can't put it down.
1932100385|1.0|I guess I expected more information about the cultural groups and their actual diets.  This book is really for other scientists not the layman looking for information that could be applied to their everyday diets.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|I can see where some people were not able to get exactly what this movie was about.  It makes you think outside the box. <br /> <br />Imagine being a young Marine trained to kill, that is your only goal while in the Marine's...kill, kill, kill! <br /> <br />Now imagine being sent to war...the onle thing you have been trained to do and you are very much looking forward to going.  But they get sent to Desert Storm, which we all know is more of an airforce war than a ground war.  You sit and wait, and walk and wait, and stand your post and wait.  Do you get the idea, not a lot going on here.  Than you also see what happens to their loved ones back home stateside, which is very interesting point of view I had never really considered. <br /> <br />If you want a Marine Sniper's point of view on how the Desert Storm was fought, this is a great movie.  If you want a full of action and killing war movie, this is not the movie for you. <br /> <br />Step outside the box and put yourself there.  This movie tells that story, one hardly ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br />Great job!
0060899220|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from cover to cover.  As I have never worked in a kitchen, much of it was interesting to read just as a peek into the kitchen.  I found it humourous account of one man's rising through the kitchen ranks- it educated and entertained.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|If you are looking for a story of the man that was Johnny Cash and the woman he loved almost his entire iife this is the movie that tells it.  <br /> <br />It goes in depth on their relationship, which can be quite amusing and somewhat challenging at times, but aren't all relationships.  It is just wonderful to get an insight on one of the best love storys in music's history. <br /> <br />If you are looking to get a movie about Johnny Cash and an insight on him, this is not the movie for you!
B000E97HIA|5.0|This CD is one of his best.  I have all of them and it is so refreshing to have music that is old school plus new school.  Some of these songs remind me of his past work and some songs sound like music of today. Thank you so much PRINCE for making me feel 20 again at 46.
B00005JOE8|4.0|Just what my title says. Immagine the doomsday, totalitarian government and gritty realism of 1984 mixed with the power and derring-do of The Scarlet Pimpernel, with  a(n) (anti-)hero definetly reminescent of that deranged genuis, the Phantom of the Opera, all in the best way possible.<br /><br />A bit more on the hero: the ordinary-guy past of the protagonist of 1984, whose name escapes me at the moment, the way he turned himself into a minor superhero through intense physical and mental training like Sir Percy (of Scarlet), and his obviously tormented mind, like Erik (of Phantom).<br /><br />I truly loved the message. It could've so easily turned into \\"Life's a bitch, then you die. Whatcha gonna do about it?\\", but it turned into more of a \\"I help those who help themselves\\" sorta thing.<br /><br />The world in which V and Evie and the others live is scarily accurate. In one of my favorite scenes, a purple-faced, bellowing dictator shakes his fist in the air as he stands at a podium emblazoned with his ominous red-and-black emblem, as rows of gray-uniformed, blank-faced soldiers march past in a neverending wave of death. Think Hitler's Nazis mixed with Stalin's Soviets.<br /><br />Enough rambling and ranting, now. Go see it, and if you have, rock on. Vive la Revolution!
0689865384|4.0|When I first picked up the book I didn't like it. I had to get pass the first chapter or so to fully understand what they were talking about and start enjoying it. When I understood what was going on, I couldn't put it down. The story just pulls you right into it and makes you feel for them. When they get caught or in a suspenceful situation you hope that it all works out and they get away. As soon as I finished Uglies, I went straight out and bought Pretties. I am already more than half way done with it and it's amazing just like Uglies. I recommened you all reading it.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|I really cannot understand the negative feedback about this movie. <br />I think this film hits a raw nerve in the American public, that prejudice and hate cripples everyone. This film is important to remind all of us that life and love can present itself in many different ways. There is no reason to be disgusted by this story. Even our Christian friends were moved. Now thats History!  <br />Congratulations Ang Lee and the actors for being daring, unafraid and courageous enough to go to the limit with your talents. That is true artistry. <br />My wife and I loved this movie and we were pleased to bring our kids too. <br />We need to start teaching our kids there are different people out there... <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|Worth of 5 stars without a doubt, this is one of the greatest albums of all time. I am not even that hardcore of a radiohead fan, this album turned me on to them. Their best work by far, right up there with Dark Side of the Moon and London Calling, as well as Zeppelin's greats.
B00001SIES|5.0|Being one of the Greatest bands in this world for many years now it comes as no suprise that the Americans have fianlly cought up with MUSE. their first album - Showbiz (sunburn & Unintended=brilliant) is one of the greatest debuts i've listend to and it only got better and better. Origin Of Symmetry really pushed them into the spot light and showed us all that Matt, Chris and Dom are without doubt musical geniuses.  <br />if you can i recommend getting Hullabaloo. a sort of 3rd album, but lets not call it that. it contains 1 cd full of B-sides and a 2nd cd with much of their live Paris gig in 2001. this album contains the two stunning singles - In Your World - Dead Star - which were never released on anyother album, just as singles. <br />then came their latest album Absolution. their 3rd album for us and their 1st for you. i saw them live for this tour (twice) and it really was amazing. my complete favourite is - Stockholm Syndrome - but another fully packed album from MUSE.  <br /> <br />been a huge fan since Showbiz and seen them live a few times now, i cant think of a better band this world has ever produced. i now make that 3 English bands in the all time top 3 for me. 1.MUSE 2.The Beatles 3.Radiohead.  <br />my american top 3 though - 1.Jimmy Eat World 2.Green Day and then its out of The Doors, The Foos or Guns & Roses? <br /> <br />i really expect them to go on and on and lets all hope for Musics sake they do.  <br />other great bands that you might not have heard, worth listening to - Hell is for Heroes, Feeder(you may know), The Cooper Temple Clause, Mogwai and INME, to name but a few.
B000301YY8|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time. Every single track is great, I didn't want to skip a single song. I can't listen to Goodbye My Lover without crying! James Blunt's voice is so unique altho the songs don't all sound the same. A must have for anyone's CD collection!
B000002WU9|5.0|All these WU CD's I can listen to over and over again, they bring back good memories. I can remember the summer Only built for cuban linx came out.. rocked that CD over and over and over again. These are CD's to hold on to, bahhh.. the memories.
B0001K9IJ8|5.0|The breezy and haunting sounds of The Girl in the Other Room has moved through the air of my home, gently filling the space with the resonating notes of a steady bass, the soft tapings of a high hat and cymbal and a voice that feels to whisper the lingering lyrics of songs written from the soul. Diana's fingers seem to barely touch the keys of her instrument, her heart expressing the existence of languid spirits, lost loves and memories of abandonment, past affairs and the fading scent of summertime.<br /><br />The music of Diana Krull redefines the meaning of the word \\"cool\\" or more so, brings its meaning back to its original roots, where cool can really only be expressed through the sounds of jazz and blues.<br /><br />Most of these tunes are a creative collaboration between Diana Krull and the genius of Elvis Costello. It is entirely evident that these two artists' have that mysterious ability to bring their minds and souls together, creating some extraordinary music.<br /><br />Hearing track twelve for the first time, Departure Bay, Diana's voice, like the magical chanting of an ancient magi, entered my being and opened my spirit to the endless possibilities of music, seemingly transporting the soul to other realities, beautiful worlds and landscapes, places the soul always yearns for in secret, waiting for the chance to finally go there...and stay.<br /><br />Diana and Elvis Costello have truly exceeded themselves with these songs.<br /><br />This CD is magical, strangely enchanting and truly mesmerizing.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|I liked the movie mainly because it remided be of full meadal jacket with out the combat. I was hopping for a more emersive film but I fell asleep after about 50 min. This movie a rental.

I would love to thank them all. Once you think he cant top the last one he does!<br /><br />Words fail for this movie, just see it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />L
B00004SYWZ|5.0|The mature and strong artistic approach A-ha started in 1990 with their underrated classic, \\"East Of The Sun, West Of The Moon,\\" is catapulted to the finest heights imaginable with \\"Minor Earth, Major Sky\\" just ten years later. While the band may have gone through inner turmoil throughout that decade, the conclusion is the light at the end of the tunnel is burning bright .... and we are still proudly feeling the effects today. This album has been judged as the 'comeback of A-ha' but to the true/devoted fan (both overseas and here in the States) it was just another milestone in an otherwise honorable career.  <br /> <br />The sound of \\"Minor Earth, Major Sky\\" is a somewhat return to the synth-like sound that first brought A-ha fame (and what most listeners out there know them as). However, technology has advanced a great deal and by this point the craft was able to be more perfected, allowing a truly haunting and classy feel. The lyrics (like \\"East Of The Sun, West Of The Moon\\") have an introspective look and forlorn tone. The prevelant theme here is an aching sense of lonliness, heartbreak at relationship splits and a quiet desperation with sadness as time passes. The most dramatic (and tearful) song on the album is 'I Wish I Cared' which has a lyrical tone of anger to it, but at the same time (thanks to Morten's unmatched falsetto giftness) is deeply sorrowful. A good thing to note is that this time around, Morten has stepped into the songwriter's chair (besides the singing one, which he does the best) and pens 2 tunes. Alert fans will see this his solo side (of 1995's \\"Wild Seed\\") coming to life with his band members. Many have said \\"Minor Earth, Major Sky\\" reveals an influence/structure to such artists as the Beatles, but I personally feel that A-ha is their own voice (with all of the time passed) that stands out perfectly. <br /> <br />The most captivating and enjoyable thing about this album is the impressive sound of each track. All of them pack a punch in their own way, but the result is deeply moving to both the consciousness and subsconscious. Some call this A-ha's best album, and their is certainly much validity to those claims. I urge everyone to give this album a chance, for they will not be disappointed. You will be moved to tears at times by the sheer vocal prowess that Morten has, which is allowed to come to life thanks to his 2 other bandmates. On that note, all I can say is .... \\"Venture Out, Find, Purchase, Sit Back, Enjoy!\\"
B000AADYYO|5.0|In all of the reviews here absolutely everything is covered, except one thing.  This also happens to be the only problem I have with Opeth.  Opeth are a double edged sword, and they have spoiled me, and they will certainly spoil you.  They transcend genres, and yet could be considered overachievers in any one.  Opeth makes music, not metal, prog, baroque, jazz, nor folk, and after you have experienced Opeth, nothing will ever compare. <br />You have been warned
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is incredible for all sci-fi and non sci-fi lovers.  It is very original, has great storytelling and humor, and develops the characters perfectly.  In just 15 episodes you will fall in love with the series and be running to the store to buy Serenity (Firefly movie).  I recommend for everyone!!!
B00006ADD5|5.0|There's not much I can add to all the customer reviews. This film is an absolute classic. It's an amazing story of one man's influence on an entire culture. A great cinematic portrayel of the arabs' life in the vast expanse of the desert. It very deftly depicts the political waves of the time, how the colonizing nations of Europe tryed to exploit the less civilized nations of Asia and the middle east. <br /> <br />But the theme and crux of the film is about one man: Lawrence. A man with the guts and bravery to inspire Millions, yet a man who was psychologically tormented. Lawrence, essentially, seems to be a manic-depressive. Most of the time he has a corageous nothing-can-kill-me attitude, with unending hope and optimism. But then he falls into a pit of depression and lonliness, and even hopelessness. <br /> <br />I found this aparent dichotomy in the man to be most fascinating, and it is portrayed very skillfully by the actor who plays Lawrence. The contrast in Lawrence is an intersting historical perspective on the man, and a great allegorical perspective on men in general. <br /> <br />
B00005JKNF|5.0|Not to be a snob, like so many of the characters in this great film, but I can see where not that many American viewers will like this movie.  I loved it, but I don't think myself too representative of the typical American moviegoer.    First of all, the storyline is slow moving, subtle and moves in many directions at once.  Most American multiplex offerings tend to hit you over the head with heavy-handed action, plot twists, fewer actors, fewer subplots, and more (but less subtle) drama.      While I found the acting in \\"Gosford Park\\" excellent, especially Maggie Smith's portrayal of a snobby old lady who loves to look down on everyone around her, many lines can get lost in a soundtrack teeming with overlapping dialogue and British and other accents.  (I cheated by turning on the subtitles, and it helped me to catch things I probably would have missed.)    For me, much of the movie's appeal stemmed from the many ironies depicted and the viewer's familiarity with British and European history in the decades ahead while the characters are stuck in their 1930s worldview, unaware, for instance, of the coming Second World War, the end of British colonialism, and the general decline of Britain's position in the world.  I also liked the way Altman takes a well-worn movie genre, stands it on its head and uses it to make observations about a class of people few of us are truly familiar with but have plenty of preconceptions about, and their behavior and relationships to each other and especially their treatment of servants, all while making a whodunit that would have done Agatha Christie proud.      Altman has given us an entertaining and insightful movie.  Unfortunately, it's a movie that not that many American viewers will ever appreciate for the masterpiece of irony and subtlety that it is because not many have heard of it, and few will ever be willing to take the time to watch it.    My only quibble is that the end comes perhaps too quickly and quietly -- well, I am an American myself, after all -- and seems almost anticlimactic.  I felt like it was just about to get REALLY good, when suddenly it was over.
B00000IPAX|4.0|This is easily my favorite Blink album, and while I wouldn't put it up there with my favorite albums of all time (Dookie by Green Day and Rage Against the Machine's self titled debut, for example), it is certainly a competent power pop album, and one of the better albums of the late ninetys. Here's a track-by-track breakdown. <br /> <br />1. Dumpweed- A fun opener. I especially like the buildup to the chorus and then the chorus itself. 8.5/10 <br />2. Don't Leave Me- I love this song, both musically and lyrically. The chorus is fun to listen to. 9.5/10 <br />3. Aliens Exist- A lot of people love this song, but for me it's kinda meh. Doesn't really hold my attention. 6.5/10 <br />4. Going Away to College- A pretty good song. The lyrics are well written, and Mark sounds pretty sincere... well, sincere for Blink, anyway. 9/10 <br />5. What's My Age Again?- God, how I loved this song when I was in fifth grade. And it really hasn't lost much since then. I don't laugh at the lyrics anymore, but it's still catchy as all get out, and still fun to listen to. 9/10 <br />6. Dysentary Gary- An underrated song. This is one of my favorites on the album. The dynamics change a few times in this one, as do the lead vocals from Tom to Mark and back to Tom. The lyrics are some of Blink's best; they're sincere and tongue-in-cheek at different points in the song. 9.5/10 <br />7. Adam's Song- Realize that you will either fall in love with this song and totally relate to the lyrics or you will hate it and dismiss it as a clichd attempt to move units by trying to make gloomy kids relate to the lyrics. Sadly I was one of the former (No pun intended). 9.5/10. Your results may vary. <br />8. All the Small Things- I never liked this song much. I didn't like the lyrics at all, and the music just never did anything for me. 6/10 <br />9. The Party Song- Well, at least it's fun to try and figure out what he's saying. And even more fun to sing along to! 7/10 <br />10. Mutt- Why does everyone lovethis song so? (Don't say because it was in American Pie.) I mean it's an alright song, I just don't really like it as much as everyone else. The lyrics are pretty good though. 7.5/10 <br />11. Wendy Clear- For some reason I've only listened to this song once or twice. And I hardly remember it. From what I remember though... 7.5/10 <br />12. Anthem- A good closer. I think I appreciate it more now that there's an Anthem Pt. 2, but regardless, this is a good song. The lyrics are both entertaining and relatable, and the music, once it gets going, is energetic. A good end to a good album. 9/10
B000BYA5G4|4.0|I thought this movie was interesting and had some great action in it.  Nicholas Cage was awesome, as always.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday.  All of the DVDs were in perfect shape and the packaging was nice as well.  It was a great gift!  I would recommend both this supplier and this product to everyone!
B000E97Y6K|3.0|I was not impressed.  The acting was not great, and it was too long.  I give it 3 stars because it is still worth seeing because of the action.
B000ENWKN8|4.0|I just got this CD and I have to say, it's good to see Rob is still writing good music. After taking so much time away from music to do movies, it was a comfort to hear good tunes and see that one of my favorite bands still can crank out good tunes. I do have to say though, that this is not your usual ROB ZOMBIE record... <br /> <br />Since RIGGS's departure to the band SCUM OF THE EARTH in 2004, I (like many Rob zombie fans) was somewhat shocked because, Riggs was (in my opinion) the driving force behind the guitars and grinds of the signature \\"Rob Zombie sound\\". Knowing this, I didn't lose faith in Rob and the long wait was well worth it. Despite Foxy Foxy being pushed as the single, I think the best tunes are \\"17 Year Locust\\" with a great mid-tempo crunch, and \\"Death of it All\\" which sounds like it could easily be on a soundtrack from another of his horror films. This album is not your typical ROB ZOMBIE release, it's not what I expected. It's different, it's evolved and it's got a fresh, but familiar sound. The difference is that RIGGS is no longer contributing, but that's OK for me, because now we have TWO great bands, for the price of one... the new ROB ZOMBIE, and SCUM OF THE EARTH, both are my faves.   <br /> <br />All in all, we get another great piece of work from ROB ZOMBIE, and with his new fresh sound, some hardcore Zombie fans may shun away from it and say he sold out, blah, blah, blah... There's nothing wrong with an artist EVOLVING. It's important for change and growth, and this change and growth I see is a good, no... a GREAT thing!
B000AP04FG|2.0|I didn't think this movie was that great.  I give it two stars because I enjoy both the main characters, but other than that it was not worth seeing.
6305910340|5.0|Searching For Bobby Fischer is the best chess movie I've ever seen, and you don't have to know anything about chess to appreciate it.<br /><br />If you're into sports movies or war movies, you'll find the competition every bit as absorbing, by the final tournament, as any movie.  It's not actually about searching for the real Bobby Fischer, though the narrator does tell us quite a lot, as this story unfolds, about Fischer, his rise to championship, and his disappearance.  But this story is about a seven-year-old boy who could become the new Bobby Fischer, if his teacher (Ben Kingsley), parents (Joe Montegna & Joan Allen), and friends (Laurence Fishburne, et al) can strike the right balance.<br /><br />It's appropriate for the whole family, with the usual lessons about parental pressure to compete, and fascinating insight about competition, gamesmanship, and decency.  The tremendous cast includes David Paymer, William H. Macey (Fargo), Austen Pendleton (Guarding Tess), Dan Hedaya (Joe Versus The Volcano), Anthony Heald and Josh Mostel.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Usually 'mtv' music hurts my ears and my brain but I have to say I find both this and Demon Days to be really great stuff. <br /> <br />I've listened to both CDs about more times than I can count would have to call this one my favorite.  Its just a little edgier, a litte more upbeat, and a little more fun.  Either way, both are great and for 10 bucks you really cant go wrong here. <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Even as abbreviated as it is, this version of Austen's classic story is a revelation -- for once, we have a real sense of the Bennets as a middle-class country family, with pigs and chickens in the garden and crowded, energetic rustic dances for amusement.  The Bennet girls' hair is disheveled, their clothes are plain and unadorned -- in short, they're real.  I had my doubts that both Knightley and MacFadyen would be suitable in their roles, but in the end they are the most purely romantic, emotional Elizabeth and Darcy ever (and yes, I'm a great fan of the Ehle/Firth version).  This is the only version that has ever made me cry!  I just love it.

0375831002|5.0|This is as much a young adult novel as Angela's Ashes was a young adult novel. <br /> <br />This is wonderful book that should be read by all.  It is hardly only a young adult novel, yet I had to go to the children's section in my bookstore to find it.  Perhaps that is the stigma of his first two books being children's book. <br /> <br />Yes, it is accessible to young adult readers but I think Knopf really did the author a disservice by putting it in that category. <br /> <br />Others have written about the storyline so I will not.  I will say the writing is poetic and moving.  The first 30-50 pages may be difficult to get through but don't let that deter you.  There is a style and rhythm that is unique and takes a bit to get into but after that...what a joy...or should I say heartbreak ...no, I think haunting is the word Mr. Zusak would use.  The story stays in your psyche for weeks.  I hope this never goes out of print. <br />
B00005JO20|5.0|This movie was very well done and fun to watch.  I hope they release an extended edition like the lord of the rings....the extended editions of lord of the rings were 10 times as good as the theater versions.  I hate when people complain about the length of a movie being too long....as long as the movie is long to help further the story thats being told and not to drag something out then the longer the better because it means i get to be involved and entertained by it even longer!!  Bring on the extended edition because ill buy it for sure!!
6305657947|5.0|...shaken and stirred. This was an absolute stunner that I picked up. So, there I am at the grocery counter checking out; Hmm, $9.99, huh? Pierce? Why not.    Everything about the movie is a winner. The chemistry. The soundtrack. The performances. The dialogue. EVERYTHING. I almost feel guilty for paying so little and getting so much. Guess that's why there are charities, like my Xbox 360 fund and my DVD boxset drive :) Having been just burning through Season One of Remington Steele I thought I'd take another look into the career of Pierce Brosnan, and I had no idea I would find golde.
0393316041|2.0|Clearly Mr. Feynman is brilliant, but he comes off as a self-aggrandizing jerk; always having to show that he's smarter than anyone else and playing 'jokes' on people that they probably didn't find so funny.  Would I want to hang out with someone like that?  Nope!  Then why waste my time reading all of his clever anectodes?
B000E97HIA|2.0|Prince, what can I say. This man is a musical legend. Plays dozens of instruments, composes, arranges, sings. Prince is one of the greatest artists of his time, but this new album just doesn't live up to his talent and potential. I am sorry. I know everyone is jumping on the bandwagon now that he is in the spolight calling this album one of the greatest things he has put together. Hardly. Granted many of the tunes are catchy, almost infectiously so. But a great album this doesn't make. It makes the album poppy. Usually a good album take times to learn to love because it's complex. That's good art. For example, Musicology was this for me. I have listened to 3121 about a half a dozen times and I know every word, beat, groove in it already. But this doesn't surprise me. Prince had a strecth of albums after the symbol album and before Musicology that really didn't suit my tastes. This album has given me the same feeling. I just hope he does not take several years again to live up to his great potential. If you want to hear great Prince music listen to:     For You  Prince  Dirty Mind  Purple Rain  Diamonds and Pearls  Controversy  1999  Musicology  Batman  Sign O'the Times  Symbol Album
0385512104|2.0|There was a decent novel in here somewhere, but it got lost in the endless \\"autistic\\" digressions the author imposes on the reader. Frankly, I skimmed through most of these, as I'm sure most readers do. While they may indeed present a fair picture of how some autistic people think, they are an impediment to the flow of the narrative. They quickly grow tiring in their relentless \\"I don't like to be touched, I take everything at face value, I make weird noises and don't like strangers, and 9,993,002X6781=67762546562\\" Rain Man-style blah blah blah. To me it looked like padding for a fairly thin plot. Speaking of plot, it died when the focus of the book shifted from Christopher's experiences of life in general to his parents' domestic problems.    While it is not a criticism of the book per se, people who read \\"Curious Incident...\\" should not take it as a primer on autism. It focuses on but a sliver of the autistic population-autistic savants, i.e., Rain Man. (As for the idea Christopher has Asperger's--he's extremely violent, not an Aspie characteristic.) Certainly there are autistic geniuses, but there are many, many more autistics with slightly-above-average, normal, or below average IQs. Perhaps it's understandable that popular entertainment will tend to focus on the exceptional rather than the everyday, but readers should keep in mind that the experience of the main character is hardly the way most austics experience the world.     Oh, but disregard my criticism if you can't bear to have your favorite little thingies held up to scrutiny.
B000683VI4|5.0|The story of everlasting love is a beautiful theme, and not many movies pull it off, but this film did wonderfully. The younger Allie and Noah were gorgeous together and their chemistry was very believable. The older couple was also commenable. James Garner was heartrending as he watched his one true love leave him. Ryan Gosling was every girl's dream man and I fall in love with him every time I see this film. Rachel McAdams was beautiful and fun, and I believe that they love one another and that she deserves him. Gena Rowlings was heartbreaking at the loss of her husband and love Noah. Joan Allen and James Marsden did a great job making their characters, which could have so easily been made into bad guys, likeable and pitiable. The cinematography was beautiful, the story well writen, and the characters vivid. Way better than the book, in my opinion. Make sure to bring tissues, even if you don't cry in movies.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|I only discovered Joe Bonamassa about a month ago when a friend gave me a copy of Had to Cry Today. I then purchased this DVD and was blown away with Joe's skills. It's the kind of music video that you want your friends to have cause you know they will love it.
1400031354|4.0|This is the kind of book one reads on an airplane. It's about 240 pages and there's nothing taxing about the plot. There's nothing sad to bring you down. Perhaps there's a joyful reunion to lift your spirits.  <br /> <br />At the same time one is taught the subtle or profound differences between Botswana and the USA, as well as countries closer to Botswana.  <br /> <br />Ms. Ramotswe is thoughtful, smart, full of common sense, and an unforgetable character of modern-day fiction. Apart from other detectives who are always unerringly never outsmarted, she is sometimes fooled by an adversary or the subject of her investigations...a purely common happenstance in real life, and she is all the more likeable for it. <br /> <br />This is my second read of this series and I will probably read them all as long as the situation is right: a lazy summer afternoon on the porch swing, the aforementioned plane ride, or perhaps during an ill day from work.
B00006JJ51|5.0|Man, these guys are awesome, and a lot more relevent than any of todays lame ass motherf*()ing posers. Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and Eazy E make up NWA(or N words with attitudes) and they all bring something different to the mic. Forget that queer 50 Cent, and get into some real Gangstas!
B000BKDOB6|5.0|Having had advance notice of this album through both [...] and the longstanding Babelogue e-mail group, I pre-ordered this and received it the day before delivery. <br /> <br />I've given the original \\"Horses\\" as graduation gifts to MANY people...and at the same time, somehow, their mamma's were especially turned on by it as well. <br /> <br />Of course I'd heard the album when it was new, and when she first appeared in Houston, at University of Houston's Cullen Auditorium, all of my best friends made it.  I even met a coulda-been at the after-party  :)  (ahhhh, damn liver disease), and at one point we had to step over a lady with an owl-mask on, reclined on the staircase, with a gentleman being very gentlemanly.  That's the sort of night the entire month became.  Good, loving and special vibes everywhere. <br /> <br />The concert really took off when Patti read one of her Babelogues leading into \\"Ghost Dance\\", but became primal and cosmologically True during \\"Land/Horses\\".  When she and Lennie traded places, while both playing Strats, \\"doggy style\\".  Patti pulling the strings out to breaking when she was in front, to the point we could see the blood on her fingers. <br /> <br />I have to say that, because this Live disc almost lives up to that concert.  Which is in my top-5 or so ever.  (Patti, two Dylans, Jimi, and Ravi Shankar) <br /> <br />The double-bassing which Flea helped is amazing.  It's under the surface, like good bass-play is (including Jack Bruce in Cream, who, after all was said and done, WAS the leader of the group) (ok, here come the Eric debaters, but I love all 3 of them) <br /> <br />The Babelogue to \\"Land\\" doesn't grab me nearly as much as the original, in fact I think that it takes away from the part about \\"Johnny was against the locker, He drove it home he drove it home\\" etc), but it is up to date, and grand, no matter my own personal biases. <br /> <br />Focusing on just the one song, I'd have to listen again (and I did just 2 hours ago), butI think that she left out the verses of Oceanic love,  with her legs open to the Sea, the Sea of Possibilities  <br /> <br />The best line...I missed it 2 hours ago but I know it's on the live disc (I was kissing my amour) (blush)... <br /> <br />>>I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour <br />But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area&lt;&lt; <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br /> <br />The entire collection is worth so much that anyone who's not yet a Patti Fan HAS to buy it.  Don't forget to listen to the music and lyrics of the album-ending \\"Elegie\\" <br /> <br />As an aside, she and the PSG played \\"Free Money\\" and one or two other songs on The Mike Douglas Show \\"back then\\"  :D <br /> <br />AHHHH, one can only dream of What If...she and Link Wray could have ever played together... <br /> <br />PS: as a fun addendum, I saw Cannibal & the Headhunters, as an opening act for The Beatles, do \\"Land of 1,000 Dances\\".  That was fun. <br />Jimi Hendrix may also have been in King Curtis' Band, who played right before The Beatles, but my 8-mm's were stolen about 25 years ago, so I don't really know  :( )
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Holy macadamia nuts, I LOVE this music! I'm not, like, a long time fan of David Gilmour or anything. In fact, I didn't even know he did solo stuff until I heard this. But the first time I heard this I knew I had to have it. That in itself is a story which endears this music even more to me. I was in my art classroom, semi-caught up in the actual work I was doing, but concentrating, I'll admit, more on a certain senior guy who I'm totally crazy for. He's a music addict, like me, and so when he puts his iPod on, I listen. That day, he asked the art teacher if he could turn on the new David Gilmour CD, and she of course said yes. I was enchanted. Ironically, this music did have an \\"on an island\\" sort of affect for me. It's heaven.    How do I describe it? The guitar is haunting, chilling, absolutely transporting. His voice is sublime. The songs are inspiring and captivating. The lyrics are unlike anything I've ever heard before. Take the lines from the cover song, \\"Children again, on rusting swings getting higher/Sharing a dream, on an island, it felt right.\\" The closing piece lyrics are like the most mesmerizing Robert Frost poem, except with a feeling completely right for this album. \\"Along by the river we feed bread to the swans/And then over the footbridge to the woods beyond/...We walk ourselves weary, arm in arm/Back through the twilight/Home again/We waltz in the moonlight and the embers glow/So much behind us/Still far to go.\\"    I can't say anything for what he's done in the past or where he'll go in the future, because I don't know anything about either. But right here, right now, this is one of the most stunning CDs I've ever heard.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Like the most recent entries I to first saw Mononoke on Cartoon network last saturday. I had already owned Spirited Away (seeing that also for the first time on cn about a month ago) and I thought I would give it a shot after seeing on the sa Dvd that mononoke was supposed to be better. Well it did not lie. I had the movie recorded on vhs but I rather own the movies instead of having choppy commercails in them. I plan to see the last two movies before I buy them but I'll tell you one thing mononoke is already in my shopping cart. (though I can't affrod to ask my dad to buy it yet after just buying spirited away)   AS for the descripition I'm not one for gooy romance sort of films I'd rather have romance be the frosting or sprinkles to any good movie or book. Mononoke is just my type I love action and adventure stuff (my friends find it weird seeing as I'm a girl and should simply love romantic movies. four words yuck, way to mushy). Miyazaki is a pure genious!  Mononoke is about a boy who is attaked by a demon and gets fataly cursed. he heds west to try and find the spirit of the forest and beg it to lift the curse. That is basicly the jist of it with alot more details but you'll have to watch it.  What's ironic is that as far as I can tell the name Princess Mononoke is only metioned once. the rest of the time she is called san (though how you spell it I have no idea).   Over all this movie, though bloody hence pg-13, it has to be the best animated film I have ever seen. I will say once again Miyazaki is a genius.    You've got to buy this I know I am.     Oh! and for the people who think this is to gory and not for little kids. Hello!! It is PG-13. they don't rate just for fun!
1559408855|5.0|First of all, the first time i saw this movie, i was blind drunk and it shocked the hell out of me. Because of the alcohol i was unable to actually grasp anything other than what i was seeing. I had a strange memory of the sodomy scenes and the ending for a few days afterwards and queried the friend with whom i had been drinking. He lent me the movie and i sat down and watched the whole thing. Without any sort of inhibitors i was actually incredibly unsurprised by the visual content of the movie. It was the symbolism that was so beautifully woven into the story that really affected me. Several of these reviews call the movie disgusting and the writers speak only of what you see, and even the people submitting praise complain about the lack of emotional empathy involved. To be someone who can fully appreciate this movie you also have to be someone who can pick up on the subtle (and not so subtle) metaphors which pervade the movie, visually and verbally.It represents all the oppresive forces in the world; fascism, tyranny, and every action is to gain power. The youngsters are the innocence we enter the world as before we take the role of someone who takes and siezes as much power as possible, or the person who accepts that they cannot win an sinks into submission. If you have not developed a sense for those fine distinctions then you can never appreciate this movie, and you will continue to be shocked only by the perversity and perhaps miss out on the controversy it has to convey. As for the people who are unsatisfied with the lack of emotion; This movie is sadistic in every sense. The sadism and the perversity serve a purpose, of course. The substance of sadism is nothing to do with emotion. The victim is not a human, it has no feelings. It is only a lump of flesh we can contort any way we choose, and if there is pain then so much the better. That is the way sadism works in the extreme sense and Salo captured the true essence of it. As for the lack of emotion in thevictims, they were also meant to be portrayed as simple fleshy playthings. The viewer takes the perspective of the Sadist in this movie, and Pasolini succeeded brilliantly.I hope perhaps some of you take a closer look at the movie. You have to let go of that little voice in your head that tells you what is disgusting and wrong, and that a picture is just a picture. i hope you can appreciate the movie more fully for it has to be one of the most brilliant work of art i have seen.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|I had not seen the original version prior to viewing this version. I absolutely loved it. I watched it in the theater and I knew I wanted to have this movie to keep. My little brother and sister absolutely loved it as well. We can almost recite the entire movie. It is greatness!!!!!!!!!!
B000EQH2QK|3.0|What's wrong with the record companies these days?  They add two extra tracks (only one being a complete original), re-release the album, and expect us to buy it again?  It's just irritating that this happens so often these days, regardless if you can get the track for free through her website.  (And you can only get one of the tracks by the way.  Clever, huh?)<br /><br />Ever heard of a \\"SINGLE\\"?  Remember those?  You've got to look at the bigger picture people!  Singles cost about $5-$6.  Albums cost $12-$15.  Which one do you think the record company wants to release?  You do the math, and see if this release is about showcasing an artists musical talents, or the record companies business talents?<br /><br />Mariah did the same thing with Mimi.  She had a great year with that album, but unfortunately she didnt win \\"Album of the Year\\".  I'd say because it was re-released.  I'm sure Grammy voters don't appreciate that too.
B000ENWKN8|3.0|I bought the new rob zombie cd and wasn't that impressed with it. I can't stand the track foxy foxy, it sounds like he is trying to appeal to the pop rock faze. Pretty much the first listen I wasn't to impressed. The second I felt a little better, it grew on me slighty. Not the typical Zombie music, but it's ok. I love \\"Let is all bleed out\\" and \\"The Lords of Salem.\\" Basically for me the cd was best 7-11. I do like \\"American Witch\\".. but, the rest of the cd, to me lacks the typical zombie lyrics that give him that edge. In a way the cd sounds like this was the last album he wanted to do and didn't try. But, I do give him credit because like I said the last tracks of the album are really good. I'm sure this album will be better in concert.
0060005424|5.0|I am currently reading \\"Abhorsen\\", the 3rd book of the trilogy. As an ardent fan of this genre, I have read enough fantasy to honestly say this trilogy is first rate and among the best. It's up there with TLOTR, the Harry Potter series, etc. I can understand why \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Abhorsen\\" are award winners, and I loved \\"Lirael\\", too. It was funny, poignant, and jam packed with  adventure, horror, and fantastical creatures and elements that I've not seen elsewhere. Lirael, the Disreputable Dog, Sam, and Mogget are unforgettable characters up there with Frodo, Samwise, Harry, Ron, Hermoine, etc. I can't wait to finish the trilolgy and start on some of Nix's other books. Wow! I highly recommend \\"Lirael\\" and the other two books in the trilogy to anyone who loves great fantasy.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I'm not going to repeat what has already been said.  I have to say I loved this film for many reasons.  The music score is haunting and excellent.  There is a good reason Gustavo won the Oscar for his compositions.  Acting is top notch.  Heath Ledger raised his acting credibility by leaps and bounds.  I am truly sorry he did not win Best Actor for his heart wrenching performance in this film.  Lee's Direction is inspired and the cinematography breathtaking. <br /> <br />For those who would condemn this film, I ask that you give it a chance.  Brokeback Mountain has no agendas.  Brokeback Mountain's themes are Universal and important.  This film is a gift.  I feel pity for those that would not open their eyes to the messages portrayed so beautifully in this film.
0596009208|5.0|Head First Java is an excellent way to learn Java. It is written in a light-hearted, fun way. The book is unique in that it uses lots of images, puzzles and humor to teach the basic priciples of Java. <br /> <br />The only thing that I didn't like was the coverage of I/O, Networking and Threads. They combined Networking and Threads into one chapter and they combined I/O with Serialization. I think a chapter could be devoted to each of these topics.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was loaned the series back during the summer. It sat waiting on the floor. Finally at the urging of my fiance, we sat down to watch it. More to be able to get it back to our friend that out of a desire to really watch it.<br /><br />Honestly, this show took most of the first disc to draw me into the series. I watched the first few episodes with a lot of unanswered questions, much of which were 'huh, wha, and how did...' all getting no answers. I needed backstory. It took a good way into the second disc to start making connections about what was really going on and how the whole series worked.<br /><br />However once, I finally got into the characters, I got into the entire storyline. I needed something from them to make be want to see what they were doing next. In some cases it was a story arc, in others a few quick and simple catchy lines did the trick finally.<br /><br />Now I wish I had about 13 more episodes to continue a lot of unanswered questions and stories that this series left hanging. I know the movie is out there, but I think a true finish to the season would be needed to give a solid ending, or better way to continue the story of this Verse.
B000301YY8|5.0|When I first heard \\"you're beautiful\\" I knew I would like this guy. <br />Then I went online and heard some clips of him to put on myspace. <br />I went out and finally got the cd and I am so obessed with it! <br />Every song is moving. every song is deep and meaningful. <br />As one poster stated and I will echo...He is my new obession!!
B000ENWKN8|4.0|Actually sounds more like Alice Cooper Schools out more than Sabbath to me. Great Album different direction, which is also very Alice like..not everything has to be exactly the same as long as its all good and this is great
B00005JOE8|5.0|After what seemed like an eternity, Hollywood has finally cleaned all of the garbage out of the attic and is starting to make good movies again.  With duds like Glory Road, and contemptable films like Failure to Launch, Aquamarine, and The Shaggy Dog, Hollywood has been spring cleaning for the last three months.  But, now, we finally have the years first great movie.  I can already see right-wing conservative, Bush-humpers calling this film completely anti-American, and pro-terrorist.  However, what these ignorant people don't realize is this: IT'S A MOVIE FROM A COMIC BOOK!  Please think of it this way: If you had a government that was willingly killing, opressing, and controlling people, I would hope someone would stand up to them.  This film is completely fantasy.  There is only one instance in the film in which it describes America and the war in Iraq, and it really does not take it that much further. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the special effects are fantastic, and the Wachowski brothers are able to make everything look so realistic, without getting rediculous and corny like certain movies (Fantastic Four comes to mind).  The performances are wonderful, and Stephen Rea gives his best performance since Interview With the Vampire, and I think he deserves the year's first Oscar consideration (I know it's early).  Hugo Weaving's voice performance of V is good, but it kind of sounds like Mr. Smith with a Guy Fawkes mask.  John Hurt is also great, giving a Hitler-esque performance, from everything from his spitting when he talks to his strong bodily movements.  All he needs now is a moustache. <br /> <br />Yes, there are morals to the story, but we have really seen them all before in books like 1984 and Brave New World.  The idea of the dystopia is not a new one, but V for Vendetta displays it in such a new light, and it is really the first to use the dystopia with a superhero figure.  Everything in this film is great, from the story to the acting to the suspense.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|Being big time in the barbell game I saw this film when it first came out at the Grand Theater in Highlandtown, Baltimore City. The then famous movie house has since been torn down like everything else thst is worth while in this world. At the time I was teaching a weight lifting class at the Salvation Army Red Shield Boy's Club and I went with a crew of my students to see this timely movie. I already knew of most of the bodybuilders in the movie due to reading Wieder's copycat magazine \\"Muscle Builder and Power\\" a cheap York Barbell imitation. Some of the folks in the movie really paid their dues over the years and did great in the movie like Reg Park as the MC. Serge Nubret, Ken Waller, Eddie Gullianie (the early bird catches the workout)and even Big Lou. I think Mike Katz and Ed Corney were both exceptional. As always Arnold was outstanding as Arnold. In my opinion the movie would of been 10 times better if they left him and his other foreign buddy Culombo out. All the money Joe Weider spent to support Arnold as so all he had to do was lift, eat,rest,sleep and brag and use him to endorse his rip off protien products and half baked magazines there was no way he was going to see him loose the Olympia. Ed Corney was on the Original cover of the 1976 Pumping Iron - what happened? This movie was good but more focus should of been on the real life lifters not the ones that were spoon fed and supported by the famous Weider Brothers. Hey what happened after Sergio beat Arnold at the Olympia the first time they met. Sergio won because Weider knew he had to slide Arnold in easy or everyone would know what he was up to. The next year Arnold beat the unbeatable Sergio - BULL CRAP- talk about a Weider money stunt set-up. There is no way that if these two would compete in anything else then Weider's own IFBB would Arnold have a prayer over Sergio as no one else would either. I'm sure we all read the hype written be The Wieder Family: Sergio was smooth, Sergio was bloated, Sergio was not at his best - too bad bodybuilding is a Sport ran like a beauty contest and the winners are picked not earned. That's why I favor power lifting and weightlifting -pounds tell the winner not fame or money! The movie is good if you can over look all the bragging and boasting from the so called Weider's \\"Oak\\"! <br /> <br />                    \\"Enjoy\\"  Joe Kopeck   Parkville, MD / USA
B0007PAMR4|3.0|The extended edition is the exact same as many of the already available long versions.  Just polished up.  So if you've already seen the 3 hr version elsewhere, I wouldn't waste my time on it as I found theatrical version much more entertaining.  The most annoying part of the extended version is the background music.  It's like it never ends!  Basically the same score throughout the entire movie!  It even made some of the best scences anti-climatic!  The extended version just ruins the whole movie.  But if your a major Dune fan and want more of the movie, better to find yourself a copy of the Dune mini-series version.  My favourite thus far....
B000E97Y6K|5.0|I saw this movie eight times when it was in theaters and each time i loved it. Of course this movie is nothing to the orignal 1933 King Kong but its a hell of a movie none the less. I was completely blown away by the F/X and the realism of Kong is unlike anything i have ever seen. Granted there were (in my opinion) some things that could have been left out but over all i think the movie is a momumental achivement. Also (personally) i would have casted another person to play Denim because i am not a huge Jack Black fan but i am utterly tounge-tied about this movie and how much i enjoyed it. A +++
B000A6CLL0|5.0|I didn't see the entirety of this season during it's original airing so a lot of it made zero sense to me at the time. But looking back at it now this season of Enterprise is the beginning of what could've been a very strong future for this series.[[ASIN:B0009I7NGW Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Second Season]] ended with an episode called 'The Expanse' in which the NX-01's mission is abruptly changed when a race called the Xindi attack Earth unproked,killing millions including Trip's sister. After learning the multi species Xindi are building a weapon to destroy the planet it's on with this season. The subplot about the Xindi gives these episodes a great base on which to build rather then drowning the stories out-overall this stories presented this season are a lot more varied and interesting then the previous season.Everyone here has their own favorite episodes so I will name mine:<br />IMPULSE<br />  On a ship of mutated Vulcan zombies T'Pol is exposed to trilium which causes her to experiece intense emotional reactions-a great sense of drama.<br />EXTINCTION<br />  In a similar plotline to the TNG episode 'Identity Crisis' Archer,Hoshi and Reed are mutated into alien primates and it's found this is a dead races long lost method of repopulating itself. Some of the \\"transformation\\" FX sequences are eerily incredible!<br />NORTH STAR<br />  One of my favorites of the season-Archer and company go Western style when they discover a colony of 19'th Western-era Americans whose ancestors were kidnapped from Earth by aliens to work as labor. A great,fast paced tale about the prejiduce created by gross revisionist history.<br />SIMILTUDE<br />  This episode is a lot of people's favorite from this season.Trip dies and the only way to save him is an organ transplant from a close Phlox creates from a mimetic lifeform that starts out looking like a ball of tripe. But as the Trip clone realizes who he is he begins to have doubts about his reasons for life.Another one of those great \\"tough choice\\" episodes.<br />HATCHERY<br />  Captain Archer becomes an \\"obsessed mother figure\\" to a group of infact insect Xindi after he becomes obsessed with delivering the infants back to their people.One of Scott Bakula's best moments in this role!<br />E2<br />  There are suddenly two Enterprise's when an alternate timeline is created where NX-01 is forced into becomming a multi generational vessell.<br /><br />  One thing about this season is it's NOT  for the time travel phobic-this season is chock full of episodes involving time travel to the past,future (including the return of Daniels and a cameo from the 26'th century Enterprise J) and every kind of alternate reality you can think of. One interesting plot twist is the awkward interpersonal relationship between the suddenly heavily emotional T'Pol and Trip. Not to mention that,even the episodes featuring the multi species Xindi keep a non-stop progression;this season has none of the dead,boring moments the previous one did. It's really a pity Enterprise never was able to continue beyond the next season because this could have been a new beginning for this series rather then the near end it turned out to be.hose great \\"tough choice\\" episodes.<br />HATCHERY<br />  Captain Archer becomes an \\"obsessed mother figure\\" to a group of infact insect Xindi after he becomes obsessed with delivering the infants back to their people.One of Scott Bakula's best moments in this role!<br />E2<br />  There are suddenly two Enterprise's when an alternate timeline is created where NX-01 is forced into becomming a multi generational vessell.<br /><br />  One thing about this season is it's NOT  for the time travel phobic-this season is chock full of episodes involving time travel to the past,future (including the return of Daniels and a cameo from the 26'th century Enterprise J) and every kind of alternate reality you can think of.

B000ENWKN8|5.0|This is Zombie's darkest album yet <br />This is Zombie's heaviest album yet <br />This is Zombie's slowest album yet <br /> <br />All of those things in the same album!  There's dark acoustic guitar, higher notes for Rob...definitely got a dark classic rock feel.  Even the lyrics are different.  Carnivals and real life horror!  There's not even a parental advisory sticker. <br /> <br />this album is dead serious...dead.  and it's awesome.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Yes, it's true.  A two-hour movie can't cover as much ground as a five-hour mini-series, and it may be unfair to expect it to.  What is a reasonable demand, however, would be expect the filmmakers to make judicious cuts in the narrative and not to rush, rush, rush through a fairly complex storyline and to run roughshod over the elegant dialogue that the story's original author provided her flawed, but self-aware and articulate characters.    This film's failings--when compared to the artistic success of the 1995 BBC series--begs the question as to whether or not a novel this rich and this subtle doesn't deserve a full five or more hours to unfold on film.  Maybe that's the only real way to translate Austen's literary genius successfully to a visual medium.      For the first half hour or so, I thought the problem may have just been me.  But when we got to the \\"Mr. Collins\\" scenes, I knew something internal to the film had gone awry.  The equivalent passages in the book--as well as the equivalent scenes in the 1995 production--make for masterful comic moments.  In this film, it's BING (Collins arrives) BANG (he proposes to Elizabeth, who rejects him completely) and BOOM (he marries Charlotte).  The acting is fine--especially Tom Hollander, who has some fine comic moments as Collins.  But the timing is way off.    I will give director Joe Wright and his collaborators credit for coming up with a top flight ensemble cast overall.  There has been considerable attention payed to the casting of Keira Knightley, who is somewhat closer in age to her character than previous Elizabeths had been, and there is something to be said for that kind of \\"age appropriateness.\\"  All well and good.  She's a fine young actress.  But her dialogue--like so much else in the movie--is too rushed and therefore almost awkward.  Elizabeth should speak with a kind of regal self-confidence.  That she doesn't quite manage that may not be Knightley's fault.  It's hard to be a witty and spirited conversationalist when you're obliged to dash through your lines.    Matthew McFadyen as the more taciturn Darcy has it somewhat easier.  Like most educated young men of his class and of his era--and like any proper Austen hero--he is supremely well-spoken when he chooses to speak. McFadyen is an appealing actor, and certainly not a bad Darcy (he will have his camp followers, just as Colin Firth has his), but just about all he has time for is a furrowed brow here, a wounded look there.    Probably the only really bad casting is that of Judi Dench as the Queen of the Night--I mean, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  In British cinema, Dench is, of course, an institution.  Here unfortunately, she's more of a mental institution.  Her moments onscreen are almost painful to watch.  Someone on this site (perhaps the Amazon critic?) has kindly described her performance  as \\"full throttle.\\"  That's polite for \\"overkill.\\"    Well, she does liven things up a bit.  But what we really need and what we really expect from any production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a certain esprit,  a sense of narrative driven by intelligent, incisive dialogue.  That's where the subtle social satire comes in.  Do away with that and you have a romantic 19th Century love story.  Not bad, but not all it could be.  And not really what it's supposed to be either.    PS--I notice I received a number of \\"non-helpful\\" votes within less than 24 hours of posting this qualified (not actually NEGATIVE) review.  Well, people are certainly entitled to their opinions (just as I am entitled to mine).  However, I do wish readers of these reviews would learn to make the distinction between \\"non-helpful\\" and  \\"I disagree with this.\\"  If a negative (or mixed) review gets you to THINK about why you liked the work in question, then, kids, it is HELPFUL.  You just happen to disagree with it.  I sometimes get the impression that some readers out there want nothing more than to see their own biases confirmed.  Which begs the question:why even BOTHER to read what anybody else thinks.
B000E97HIA|4.0|OK folks. There seem to be two main sides to reviewing this album.  <br />1. People who just don't get it. They're too cynical to enjoy an album without someone whining and complaining about the world or too twisted to hear someone talk about romance instead of talking about sex like they're a horny animal. God forbid someone embrace his spirituality. <br />2. Kool-Aid drinkers who think Prince can do no wrong.  <br /> <br />I have been listening to Prince since I was 11. I'm 36 now. I think he is clearly one of most prolific, versatile, talented artists in music history. I still cringe when I see his music listed under R&B/Hip Hop. Get rid of the labels, please.  <br /> <br />Now to the album.  <br /> <br />I actually listened to it 3 times in a row. It has been a LONG time since I've been able to do that with ANY new cd, especially a Prince cd. That's the key. This album is meant to be listened to as a whole. It's about a party. You can chill/relax for a minute, snuggle up in a quiet corner with someone special, then get up and dance till you feel like passing out.  <br /> <br />As singles, most of the songs don't work nearly as well. Te Amo Corazon is boring by itself but on the album it gives a nice break. Plus I appreciated the lyrics more.  <br /> <br />There's something I like about each piece, even if I don't like the whole song. If you know Prince, he'll never just give it to you straight. He's gotta put a twist in every song. He'll come up with an incredible melody and music like on \\"The Dance\\" \\"Love\\" and then put some rather odd transitions in the middle.  <br /> <br />Highlights <br /> <br />\\"Incense and Candles\\" This is like my theme song. For a while I've appreciated the effect of a room softly lit with flickering candles and infused with the beautiful fragrance of incense. Not crazy about the bridge. For people who freak out because he \\"raps\\", get over it. James Brown, George Clinton and many others talked through songs. Prince is more a part of thatheritage than the knuckle-dragging, mindless thugs and wastes of flesh and oxygen that we see on our tv every day.  <br /> <br />\\"The Word\\" I love the music and the basic concept. The Word can save us all. Although I wish he had chosen some lyric other than spiders and sticky webs to describe evildoers. Again not crazy about the bridge. LOVE the ending. <br /> <br />\\"The Dance\\" Sensual. Honest. Passionate. I've felt like this before. <br /> <br />\\"Get on the Boat\\" This song should make every other musician pack up their gear and go home. <br /> <br />\\"Beautiful, Loved and Blessed\\" is the most straigtforward tune, but it's for another artist so he toned down the oddness. It's very affirming and I think we all need to hear that every now and then. The old funky ending is there like on some other cuts from the past.  <br /> <br />The true test for this cd like with any other: when it ended I wanted more. The ride is a lot of fun.  <br /> <br />Get on the Boat.
0061020710|5.0|Terry Pratchett's first book is filled with humor, wit, and in-sewer-ants. Being the first book, it has an amazingly solid plotline and interesting characters. This wasn't the first Discworld book I read, though, and was surprised to find the Luggage was introduced in this first book. It has a humorous outlook on tourists, and with the introduction of insurance, Ankh-Morpork has quite a bit of remodeling to do. This Discworld book is as good as any other, following the escapades of the wiz(z)ard Rincewind and the tourist Twoflower. Any Discworld fan will want to read this book, it's the one that started them all.
0307165485|5.0|I am sick of reading this book to my daughter.  I know every story by heart.  That's what I get for remembering that this was my favorite book as a child.  35 years later and it is still a great book.  Wonderful pictures and stories, your kid will love to have it read to them (constantly) and when they get a little older, they can read it themselves.
B000003Z4C|5.0|This album is just amazing. But I must warn you. If you are a little down, you girlfriend leave you, or the the day is too rainy, well, maybe you don't need to list this particular album.  <br />But, in the other hand, if the sun is shinning, well enjoy. Nick Cave use the words (and his voice) to took you into the deep of human soul, and is a  very ugly place. Specially \\"Do you love. Part 2\\", when he describe a taxi-boy, is so cruel, and at the same time so human. But is not only the lyrics. The musicians are truly artists, like Blixa (guitar) and Mike Harvey. Loverman and Red Right Hand are an exemple of that. It is one of the Cave's greatest album
B000AARKOO|5.0|lovely movie, just the fact that people fought ebven then and they still do in the holy land, its just what they fought for then and what they fight for now, in those days, it used to be to upkeep the peace and the sanctity of jerusalem, now its to uproot it, ridley scott does the justice he is known for, i liked the way Liam Neeson played his part, A message we all need is delivered.
B000035P7X|5.0|I'm a fan of reality television even though the contestants on Survivor and Big Brother are in a completely artificial situation, as far from reality as can be.  Yet nobody is writing their script; they are writing that themselves.  These comments are also relevant to this excellent documentary of young Bob Dylan on tour in England in 1965.<br /><br />I don't like the Spotlight Reviews on this site.  They are too \\"expert\\" and don't get everything right.  They are too full of themselves.<br /><br />One of the main impressions I get from this documentary concerns the clash between beautiful and brilliant Dylan, who is actually doing something good in the world, and the reporters/critics.  True, Dylan is very confrontational with them, but they are lucky to have his attention at all.<br /><br />It seems like these nothings, these cogs in the wheels that employ them, don't get the point at all.  The point is Hattie Carroll, being murdered by a rich and apathetic white s.o.b. and getting away with it.  The point is that Bob Dylan is coming out and saying something that needs to be said.  The point is that Bob Dylan believes in right and wrong, and therefore is a mouthpiece of God, cutting through all our crap.<br /><br />And very few others were doing this at the time.  Not too many are doing it now either.  Put on the radio.  What do you hear?  You hear personal lyrics, I love you, I find you attractive, I'm mad at you, whatever.  In one genre you hear that you are worthless except to the degree that you turn me on, and that the singer is worth more than you because he has a fancier car and more expensive jewelry, and will blow you away with a shotgun.<br /><br />What a bunch of baloney.  What kind of values are we offering to the young people who listen to this idiocy and think it is cool?<br /><br />Then you have Dylan.  Justice.  Poetry.  Intelligence.  How often do you hear a lyric on the radio that is intelligent?<br /><br />Contrast the Dylan of this documentary to some of the more recent Dylans.  Do you know the song Union Sundown?  That's the one ripping globalization to shreds, a decade before everyone else realized it needed to be stopped, a way to maximize profits by paying pennies for labor, firing American workers and replacing them with slave labor overseas.<br /><br />Contrast that Dylan to this younger one.  The more modern one, the older one, isn't physically beautiful anymore, isn't a pixyish darling anymore, but he's just as on target, just as sharp and penetrating.<br /><br />One of the highlights of this video is the live performance of the beginning of It's All Over Now Baby Blue at the special request of Donovan.  First, Donovan sings a perfectly nice song, then Dylan sings a freaking masterpiece.  I like the way Dylan smiles as he sings \\"yonder stands your orphan\\".  Think about that line.  Your orphan?  That means you are dead, doesn't it.  I like Dylan's smile as he sings that line, a smile saying hey, listen to that lyric, get it?  It's one of the really interesting lines to It's All Over Now, Baby Blue.<br /><br />At the Albert Hall, Dylan is alone with his guitar and harmonica, no band behind him, and he is mesmerizing the world's most elite audience, the Beatles among them.  He's doing it just being himself, his brilliant self.<br /><br />I like most of the commentary.  This is one of the few videos where I played the film a second time to listen to the whole commentary.  It's funny the way one of the commentators gives all his reasons for being pleased that Hattie Carroll was cut off before its climactic ending and thunderous applause, and then the other commentator, who is obviously right, completely disagrees with what we've been listening to, in a perfectly non-confrontational way, and says that was the one song that should have been shown in its entirety.  Far from detracting from the effectiveness of the film, this song would have made the entire point of the film, that Dylan was a powerhouse.<br/><br />Real people, worth watchingn was a powerhouse. <br /> <br />Real people, worth watching
B00006690G|5.0|The Eminem Show is the best Eminem CD. It is absolutely flawless.  <br /> <br />Tracks: <br />1. Curtains Up [Skit] - N/A <br />2. White America - 5/5 - Great political message.  <br />3. Business - 5/5 - Really funny song. <br />4. Cleanin' Out My Closet - 5/5 - Very good personal song about his upbringing. One of Eminem's best songs. <br />5. Square Dance - 5/5 - Love the beat. Funny song as well. <br />6. The Kiss [Skit] - N/A - Perfectly executed skit. Leads up to Soldier very well. <br />7. Soldier - 5/5 - Great flow on this song. <br />8. Say Goodbye Hollywood - 5/5 - Great song about the struggles of being famous. <br />9. Drips - 5/5 - Obie Trice steals the show. Really, really good. <br />10. Without Me - 5/5 - Great song. Really funny. <br />11. Paul Rosenberg [Skit] - N/A - Kind of pointless, but its short so it doesn't matter. <br />12. Sing For The Moment - 5/5 - One of the best songs Eminem ever made. Great sampling of Aerosmith. <br />13. Superman - 5/5 - Love this song. If you ever get to see the video it's really good as well. <br />14. Hailie's Song - 5/5 - Really sad song. It's something a little different from the usual Eminem but still great. <br />15. Steve Berman [Skit] - N/A - Finally Steve gets what he deserves. <br />16. When The Music Stops - 5/5 - Eminem has a great flow. Bizarre also has an excellent verse. The other members of D12 have very good parts as well. <br />17. Say What You Say - 5/5 - Really good diss song to some of Eminem's and Dr. Dre's enemies. Love how Dre and Shady flow seamlessly together. <br />18. 'Till I Collapse - 5/5 - Another one of Eminem's best songs. The beat is absolutely amazing. Nate Dogg does a great chorus as well. <br />19. My Dad's Gone Crazy - 5/5 - Really good song. Pretty funny in parts too. <br />20. Curtain's Close [Skit] - N/A - Ken Kaniff is really funny in the end. <br /> <br />Overall - 5/5 <br /> <br />Every song on this CD is perfect. Highly recommended.
B00005LQ04|1.0|I just didn't get this movie at all.  I've heard a lot of good things about it for years, I've even heard it referred to as a \\"horror classic\\".  Well...this movie has taught me to believe none of which you hear and half of what you read.<br /><br />The plot was fair, but the storyline just drags and drags.  The viewer finds himself longing for something (anything) relevant to happen, and when it does...yawn.<br /><br />Okay...I've heard an endless amount of praise from a multitude of different people on the color scheme of this film, \\"Oh...the colors Dario Argento uses in Suspira are amazing...oh, the colors, did you see the colors he used?\\"  Who the hell cares?  I certainly didn't.  The movie was colorful, so what?  I saw an oil stain in a department store parking lot that had all the colors of the rainbow in it, should I give that two thumbs up?<br /><br />The score in the film was decent.  That hardly makes up for everything else though.  I tried to like this film, I really did.  I watched it twice just to give it a fighting chance.  Nothing, not even an inkling of suspense , terror, or creepiness.  Not impressed at all.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />This movie is more hype than delivery.  If you are impressed with something as irrelevant as \\"a color scheme\\"  or a storyline with a turtle-like-pace, you'll think this is a winner.  For those of you who are a little more intelligent, save your money.  If you're in the market for something really creepy, I recommend the original \\"Halloween\\".
B00029LNHS|3.0|I'm not really into their type of music, but when \\"Where is the Love\\" started conquering the radio stations, I took notice of them. I thought \\"Where is the Love\\" was an OK song, but \\"Shut Up\\" is even better. It's so catchy with a nice radio sort of sound and has a great beat. \\"Hey Mama\\" is also a magnificent one, it gets you in the mood, it's got terrific background music (I actually want to listen to it very much right now). The very best is \\"Let's Get It Started\\" or \\"Let's Get Retarded\\", it's actually the same thing, it was the reason I set out to get this album. I fell so in love with it, (\\"Started\\" was better than \\"Retarded\\", personally) it's exactly the sort of music you play at the start of a party, I often hit the repeat button when I come across this one! It reminds me of \\"Get the Party Started\\" by Pink. <br />Basically the only reason that I gave this album three stars only, is that despite the love I have for their singles, the other songs were plain and boring. They're not fillers but there is not one other song that has caught my attention yet, and I've had this album for two weeks, which means it'll leave my CD player for a while, and I won't miss it. I think their second album \\"Monkey Business\\" is better and I recommend that album more.
B000001DYJ|5.0|I'm not one of these old fogies who was a teenager back in the 70's.  I didn't see KISS live until I was in 6th grade and they came to town on the Animalize tour.  I have all of their albums.  This is the lineup I like best.  Bruce and Eric play circles around Ace & Peter and it shows up in this performance.  The production on Alive 1&2 sucked.  This shows a tighter sounding and more talented KISS than that of the 70's.  Nice selection of songs as well.  Go ahead and keep the first 2 ALives.
B00007LTIB|5.0|\\"To Be Over\\" is a magnificent track, i.m.o. the best single thing Yes ever recorded.  It's the only track I repeatedly listen to off of this CD, and it is MORE than enough to recommend this cd to anyone who likes progressive rock music.  \\"To Be Over\\" = the capstone of prog rock.
B00005JOUM|4.0|There are movies that don't want to end.  You think the credits should be running anytime now, but no.  The movie keeps throwing \\"ending\\" after \\"ending\\" at you until you're just ready for it to be over with.  Inside Man is one of these movies.      There are some good even great things going on in Inside Man.  As a character and genre study, its amazing.  Screenwriter Russell Gewirtz has fun with the heist film cliches, by creating a situation that's unknown to the viewers until close to the end, and then building a heist film around it.  There is a motive here, hidden and entirely secret that stretches beyond a mere bank robbery much like this film is more than about a heist.  Half of the film's fun comes from confusion and trying to ascertain why the heist is happening, what's going through Clive Owen's Dalton Russell's head.      As a character study, it's also interesting.  Not one of the main characters has morals.  Each character has a motive, a desire and not one of them is pristine.  Its nice after seeing her in two women in distress films, that Jodi Foster can bring the cold-hearted and calculated feelings to her character.  The characters are morally ambivalent and, while it can be considered a jaded view of society, but it was interesting seeing conflicted characters who might not be interested in what's right or wrong, but what's good for them.  It might be jaded, but it also is in some ways a good representation of how some things work.      Of course there were some indications that this is a Spike Lee film.  Some of his critiques on society are spot on and humorous.  I did take offense with the very minor, but definitely frustrating poke at video games.  Very minor in the film and has nothing to do with it that I hate to bring it up.  But the implication that even these morally ambivalent characters have a problem with a video game (not even an actual game, by the way) was frustrating to me.  Others seemed timely, but stretched.  As an example, the Arab who's really a Sheik and the police saying something to the effect \\"Oh my God he's Arab!\\" seemed strained.  Timely, interesting, yes, but seemed stilted.    Spike Lee also does a great job of introducing minor characters that really help to flesh out the story and provide a backdrop for what's happening.  For instance, the cop who comes on the scene in the beginning and his story of when he first had a gun shoved in his face is interesting.  Needless, maybe, but interesting.  Its just unfortunate that at times, Lee seems more interested in pursuing these little details instead of keeping the film moving.    At any rate, its an interesting film that gets bogged down toward the end.  Pacing issues aside, it is a good film that turns some heist conventions on its head while presenting jaded characters who each have a motive and who are very human and real.  It would have been better, though, with a litter tighter script that didn't have to explain every little thing at the end.
B000002HRE|4.0|Metallica's 'Load' albums are one of the most overlooked and underappreciated Metallica albums ever, why? Because Metallica changed their image. From thrash to hard rock, Metallica created the Load albums, Reload, the second of these albums has to be the best of the two and one of my favourite Metallica albums. Old school fans for some reason have a problem with these albums, because the speed metal that created Metallica no longer exists, the contriversial Load album unfortunatly wasn't a very good album and because of this many people have overlooked Reload, despite it being actually a really good experience. <br /> <br />As mentioned this album is actually really good, it isn't as brilliant as some of the previous albums, but it still is a great listen, the album opens up with a really catchy, speedy song, Fuel. This is a great opener to the album and is one of the greatest songs on the album, it's quite fast with fun lyrics with a short but great solo - 9/10. <br /> <br />The next song, The memory remains, is actually a good one, but the S&M version is much better, as it doesn't have the crude voice of Marianne Faithfull's backing vocals. - 7/10 but the s&m version is simply a 8/10. <br /> <br />The devils dance is slow paced but with great use of the bass, the lyrics are very good and the solo is also very entertaining, if not a tad short, not to be overlooked - 8/10. <br /> <br />The Unforgiven ll, an awesome song indeed. I think that this version is a lot better than the previous one on the Black Album, the guitars are much more stronger, the song is longer, with very emotional back up vocals at parts, Hetfields singing is improved and the slow paced acustic is gone. Just like the original, the lyrics are very metaphoric and have some repetition. Even the small solo is great fun and emotional, but not as good as the originals solo. - Best song on the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />Better Than You - Isn't a bad song but isn't really one to go crazy about. 6/10 <br/> <br />Slither - A great rhythm, and the drumming is very well timed and precise, but there are better songs again. 6/10. <br /> <br />Carpe Diem Baby - Now this is a great song, it's a song you have to sing along to, the guitars are very dominant and Hetfield doesn't sound like he's straiing to sing in this song, it's very relaxed, the riffs are good and the solo is quite lengthy for this album and is actually quite good. \\"Then make me miss you\\" - 9/10 <br /> <br />Bad seed - nice lyrical value but this song isn't one worththe listen really, give it a miss. -6/10 <br /> <br />Where the wild things are - Just awesome, you'll really like this song listen to it and enjoy the chorus and the simple yet, fine musical power. 9/10 <br /> <br />Prince charming and Low man's lyric aren't that great either, not quite 6 not quite 7. -6.5/10 for both. <br /> <br />Attitude - Great one, it seems quite overlooked though it really is worth the listen as it's riffs are great and the production of this song is very well done. 8/10 <br /> <br />Fixxxer - Hightlight of the album, a terrific closer with great lyrics, a great introduction a great chorus and an amazing finish. the solo is good and the slow stretching period emphasizes the conslusion all to well. 9/10 <br /> <br />As you can see above, there are some songs that really deserve the listen, they are really great and show a lot of maturity in Metallica's performance and song writing, forget your strickly 'metal' attitudes, take a look at this and see soem great songs on offer,
B000ENWKN8|4.0|I just picked this up this morning and I couldn't get over the booklet. All the pictures remind me of the old promo photos of Black Sabbath, which I thought was pretty cool looking, and then I put in the cd and liked what I heard as well. The songs have that same lyric material that Zombie has become synonymous with (but even like I said about the booklet, the songs kind of reminded me of Sabbath-esque material as well), however the actual music of the CD is kind of lacking, and here's why - John 5. <br /> <br />This man is a terrible guitarist and most of the riffs come off sounding like leftovers from his run with Marilyn Manson. He even seems to have infected Tommy Lee and Josh Freese's drums on here with that same monotonous \\"Beautiful People\\" sounding beat. Why he was chosen as guitarist on this CD, I'll never know; there were dozens of other awesome guitarists to choose from, but hey, whatever works. It's his CD, not mine. <br /> <br />Overall this is definitely a 5 star CD even if it is slightly watered down compared to his previous solo work and his White Zombie material, so one star is missing from my review due to John 5 and his lack of creativity.
B000001EIA|5.0|I saw this live on MTV before I bought this CD.  This was a pretty interesting show having the old and new members all play as one.  It was refreshing to hear some of the songs played live like \\"Coming Home\\" and \\"Sure Know Something\\" that haven't seen the light of day in a live performance.  It's here we saw the great chemistry between the band members (old and new) as every song sounded great.  I think KISS needed to do this.  It was new and exciting.  It reignited my interest in the band.
0141301074|4.0|The Twits is another hilariously entertaining book by Roald Dahl. The story revolves around Mr. and Mrs. Twit, a hideous couple, just possible the ugliest couple in the world. They love to torment each other in all sorts of ways in a never ending battle to get back at each other. Glass eyeballs, balloons, and worms, the list just goes on and on. Their house is a prison-like building with a huge garden full of nettles and thistles with a dead tree looming somewhere in the mess. After a couple side stories, the main plot comes to play. The Twits are soon faced with the greatest danger they have ever encountered, a vengeful monkey family and an army of birds tired of being stuck in pies. This book seems to cover it all. <br /> I particularly liked the descriptions of Mr. and Mrs. Twit. The portrayal of Mr. Twit's hairy beard is shown in this quote from the book. \\"By sticking out his tongue and curling it sideways to explore the hairy jungle around his mouth, he was always able to find a tasty morsel here and there to nibble on.\\" Not to be outdone, the diabolical Mrs. Twit doesn't come short in a contest of evilness between the two. One excerpt from the book can clearly depict that. \\"But the real reason she carried a stick was so that she could hit things with it, things like dogs and cats and small children.\\" <br /> My favorite part of the book is definitely the description of Mr. Twit's massive beard that covers almost all of his hideous face. The author's vivid portrayal of leftover food pieces stuck in the bushy hair is very entertaining. You can almost picture it in your mind as you read. In the end, this book was definitely worth buying.
B00000K31Q|5.0|No matter how old I get, I'll never be too old to enjoy a good teen movie.  Yes, it's rather formulaic, but 10 Things I Hate About You is smart and funny and more intelligent than your average teen comedy.  It also stars Julia Styles, which is a definite plus in my book.  I can't say my high school was anything like Padua High (how many high schools take place in a huge castle?), and I certainly never had an English teacher like the one teaching here, but every high school is pretty much the same when it comes to cliques, romances, misunderstandings, sibling rivalries, and the like.  One of the things I really liked about this film is the fact that it didn't break down according to the overused formula of rich kids vs. poor kids and never the twain shall meet (unless you're, say, Molly Ringwald).<br /><br />It's true that this film is loosely inspired by Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, but don't make too much of that.  How many teens would even know what a shrew is?  Personally, I don't look at Kat Stratford (Julia Styles) as a shrew; she's just a bitter, disillusioned teen who can't stand the thought of doing what is expected of her - and she does have reasons for taking on this persona.  Her sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is her exact opposite, a vivacious girl who just wants to be a normal teenager.  Her problem is the girls' overprotective father, who refuses to let Bianca date until Kat starts dating (which doesn't look like it will be happening any time soon given Kat's nature).  The new kid in school, Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is smitten with Bianca, and he puts together a plan to make her date-eligible by having someone else take out her sister - ingeniously using the school's pitifully shallow cool guy (and Bianca admirer) as the middle man.  The chosen one is the school's mysterious new tough guy, who has to earn the money he's being paid to win the reluctant Kat over.  Obviously, he ends up falling for the girl, which puts everything in place for the predictable conclusion.  Will Kat and the designated dater become a couple, or will everything explode in the guy's face?  Will Bianca ever win the right to get out of the house and spread her perkiness all around?  And who will Bianca choose - the hot, brainless Mr. Cool or Cameron, the nice boy who looks like he should still be in junior high?  And, since she's already taller than the guy, will Bianca ever stop putting her hair up when she goes out with him?<br /><br />Clich&eacute;s abound, but the script really is rather witty.  For those keeping score at home, the film does feature one wild dance party and the required minimum of one barfing scene, but it never crosses the line into a completely dumb teen comedy.  10 Things I Hate About You isn't quite as good as the classic John Hughes films of the 1980s, but it's easily better than most of the teen films produced in recent years.  With its PG-13 rating, it's also a teen movie suitable for teens of all ages - a little table dancing is about as racy as this one gets.lace for the predictable conclusion.

0451527046|4.0|The classic pirate tale by Stevenson, \\"Treasure Island\\" has been retold in various forms for the last 100 years.  And there is a good reason why this story has been kept alive, as it is a classic adventure tale and a coming-of-age tale.  It is geared toward a younger audience, but a reader of any age should find this tale entertaining and an easy read. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, the unlikely hero of Jim Hawkins emerges.  He is first introduced aa a fearful young boy, who runs to his mother in the face of intruders to their seaside inn.  However, Jim quickly matures as cabin-boy of the treasure-seeking ship, and he soon realizes his full potential as a young hero.  Although he may be impulsive, his actions help to defeat the pirates.  Indeed, Jim shows his bravery and intelligence as he attempts to capture the ship away from the mutineers single-handedly. <br /> <br />Certainly an overriding theme is that of greed and desire.  The nobleman Trelawney becomes giddy and gleeful when he hears of a possible treasure and quickly procures a ship and crew.  The pirates, or \\"gentlemen of fortune\\", lead their whole lives whose sole purpose is the pursuit of wealth by whatever means necessary.  Indeed, it is this greed and burning desire for gold that eventually leads to their downfall.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great adventure tale that appeals to readers of all ages.

B00005JKHP|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theater back in 1979.  I still have the original plastic popcorn cups to prove it.<br /><br />At the time I thought it was slow and bombastic, and I was dissappointed that they rehashed \\"The Changeling\\" episode from the original series.<br /><br />Well, perhaps I've mellowed a bit but I watched this DVD version last night a thoroughly enjoyed it.  The key is to relax and soak in the experience.  It's sort of a great, epic, mood piece with incredible visuals and a gorgeous sound track.  Lower your expectations and let the movie come to you.<br /><br />But beyond this, the movie poses a rather important question.  What do you do if you spend your life searching for God, and you discover that God does not meet your pre-conceived notions of what He should be?  V'ger finds that her \\"god\\" is a \\"carbon unit\\" and she doesn't believe it, but when the \\"carbon unit\\" enters  the transmission code -- proving his claim to be \\"god\\" -- she puts her faith in him, and she joins herself to her \\"god\\" and becomes a greater being for it.  There's a little to ponder there.<br /><br />Beyond this, the documentaries on the second disk are interesting, and I enjoyed the various deleted scenes that showed the differences between this directors' cut and the original version.  I haven't sat through the commentary track, but I'm looking forward to it.<br /><br />Perhaps it wasn't all it could have been (and the documentaries explain a lot of why this is so) but I believe this movie has a lot to recommend it.  I'll probably watch it again every few years until I transition to whatever the next life turns out to be.
0553573403|1.0|This has to be one of the most over-rated books I've ever read.  I honestly could not finish it.<br /><br />1.  It is extremely slow.  Only Jordan has this author beat as far as using the maximum number of words to explain the most mundane things.<br /><br />2.  Dialog is unreal and contrived.<br /><br />3.  I really did not care for the obscene material.  I felt it was uncessary to the plot and character development.  WARNING if you care about that kind of thing or are considering buying this book for your kids, I'd rate it X... Definitely.  And there is no hesitation in that at all.<br /><br />4.  Very trite.  You'll feel like you've read about these characters before and you know what?  You have!  Fantasy does tend to be very restricted in its form but how come I don't feel this way when I read Stephen Donaldson, David Gemmell, or Raymond Feist?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor... skip this series all together and read something else.

B00005JOUO|5.0|After watching \\"Inside Man\\", starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster, I tried to think of something, anything that didn't work. Honestly, I couldn't. \\"Inside Man\\" is an excellent, enjoyable film.<br /><br />Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) and his crew walk into a large bank in the middle of the Manhattan financial district, dressed as painters, and begin to rob the facility. This crew is professional; Russell seems to have thought of everything, down to the infrared lamps to knock out the security cameras. Detectives Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor, \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\", \\"Four Brothers\\") are the assigned hostage negotiating team. Frazier has a dark spot on his record, so he is anxious for the opportunity to prove himself. As soon as Mr. Case (Christopher Plummer) hears the news of the hold-up at his bank, he enlists the help of power broker Madeline White (Jodie Foster); he needs her help to ensure that something in his bank remains in his bank.<br /><br />\\"Inside Man\\" is a heist film. As soon as you realize that, you know a good example of the genre will be fun, light and breezy, keep you guessing and take you on a bit of a roller coaster ride. Check on all points. \\"Inside Man\\" is a great example of the genre.<br /><br />I have never been a fan of Spike Lee's films. Film is an art form and the best films engage your imagination, feelings and emotion. Too many of Lee's films (and Oliver Stone's for that matter) bludgeon the viewer over the head with their message. Great films also have a point of view, but Lee's films always seem to portray the ONLY message, according to the filmmaker. If you disagree, screw you.<br /><br />If \\"Inside Man\\" did not have Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster in it, I probably would not have seen it, because of director Spike Lee. I am glad I did see it because it is an excellent film. All four people are integral to the film's success, but the biggest surprise for me is Spike Lee.<br /><br />Any successful heist film is going to have to move, keep the viewer engaged and provide a form of suspense. Lee clearly recognizes the rules of this type of film and runs with them, playing with them a bit, but keeping them intact. Addressing each of the conventions of this genre, he makes them his own. All of the key points are depicted, and depicted well, leaving no stone unturned. Of course, in a heist film, the stones are unturned when and if the writer and director feel like it. I think he realized he wasn't going to be able to solve the race problems in our society, with this film, and decided to have fun. This is his most mainstream, most commercial film.<br /><br />This is not to say that Lee has gone soft. He incorporates messages and ideas into the framework of this convention. For instance, when a bank employee is released by Dalton, in disguise, the cops approach with caution. When they remove the mask, they reveal he is wearing a turban. One of the cops shouts \\"He's an Arab\\" and they tackle him to the ground. Later, an exchange between this man and Frazier leads to some telling comments about our country's current paranoia against anyone who appears different and also one of the funniest lines of dialogue I have heard in some time. Another memorable exchange concerns a video game and there are many more instances like this throughout. As the machinations of the heist are in progress, these moments help make the characters more real and the film even more enjoyable.<br /><br />Like the best Sidney Lumet, Martin Scorcese and Woody Allen films, Lee uses New York City as a character. A lot of the crew's plan depends on certain aspects of life in the large metropolis. At one point, Dalton walks right by a bank employee and they only give him a cursory glance. The city's melting pot of personalities and cultures also provides a rich backdrop for the film. Every character has been changed by life in New York and they change the story for goodand bad. From cops who immediately set-up crowd barriers to keep the onlookers back, to a cop who is dedicated to his job, but racist due to his interaction with the public, to citizens who expect a little quid pro quo for helping the cops, everyone gives the film a richness sorely lacking from most multiplexes.<br /><br />Denzel Washington's Detective Frazier is one of the actor's most memorable characters. Even with the blight on his record, he is confident, gung ho and ready for the challenge. Arriving at the bank, he meets with Captain Darius (Willem Dafoe), the police officer in charge of tactical operations. Darius is used to working with someone else and immediately discounts Frazier's presence. But the Detective realizes this will not help the situation and quickly establishes his authority. Throughout, he is always thinking, trying to guess Dalton's next move before it happens. He proves very adept at this and equally good dealing with New York.<br /><br />His character has good dialogue throughout, adding an air of levity. When we first meet Frazier, he is discussing his relationship with his girlfriend, in frank and suggestive terms, establishing his character very quickly. Frazier jokes with people throughout, while at the same time is ready to instantly become serious should the need arise, adapting to the changes. When he is interrogating people, this same tactic proves disarming, disorienting people, perhaps allowing some truth to get through.<br /><br />Clive Owen (\\"Gosford Park\\", the unfortunate \\"Derailed\\") is very good as Dalton Russell, the mastermind behind the robbery. Clearly, Russell has thought through the entire plan, many times, in an attempt to ensure everything goes flawlessly. Dalton frequently seems tired of, or perhaps resigned to, dealing with less, intelligent people. He seems to treat people with slight scorn, deriding them because they are less intelligent.<br /><br />Dalton is always clear and calculating. Through most of the film, he even appears to be more ruthless than you might think, adding an unexpected element to the heist. The film is also good about casting doubts on his character a few times; we begin to wonder if he has, in fact, thought of everything.<br /><br />Jodie Foster's Madeline White is, essentially, a supporting character, but no less memorable. As a high powered power broker, Madeline thinks everyone is beneath her, including her clients for needing her in the first place. But that doesn't stop her from working for them, and extracting huge fees. The great thing about Madeline is that even though she is a powerful woman and disliked by everyone she meets, she recognizes this and doesn't care. She knows that everyone she meets; from the Detective, to the Mayor, to Mr. Case, to Dalton Russell, everyone no matter how small, will one day be a person who can help her make new clients, settle new business, and create new favors.<br /><br />\\"Inside Man\\" is the best film I have seen so far this year.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable action movie from beginning to end.When it starts in mock-seriousness to a shuffle-dance sequence that segues into a Sergio Leone parody with Godfather shadings, you are in for an enjoyable ride. Shatters all sterotypes throughout, and yet moves along through thrilling surprise upon surprise. The ghetto set alone, the seed of great martial artists, is very reminiscent of \\"Dead End\\"/\\"Full Metal Jacket' with jarring delight.Wonderful to see good use of mature actors as martial artists.It also captures the exhilarating wish you find in \\"Life Is Beautiful,\\" that life can be redemptive and inspirational. It is a wonderful appreciation of Hollywood film work and yet original in many ways. Its awesome imagination elevates its derivative aspects completely.

B000B8QG4A|5.0|Disney's \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" was just re-released as a new two-disc DVD to celebrate the film's 50th Anniversary. It is worthy of everyone's money and attention. Children in the family? Fond childhood memories of the film? A film student? Interested in filmmaking? A kid at heart? This is the film for you.<br /><br />\\"Lady and the Tramp\\" is easily one of the best films ever made by Disney, animated or otherwise. It combines an irresistible romanticized view of Victorian America with great animated characters and a couple of catchy tunes. Perhaps the best thing about this film is the relative lack of overly cutesy elements. Because the film is told from the viewpoint of the animated animals, they become a much more important element of the story, downplaying the tendency to make animated animals `adorable' and `cuddly' (see Disney's current \\"Chicken Little\\" for an example of how overdoing it doesn't work).<br /><br />On Christmas morning, Darling, the lady of the house, opens a gift from her husband, Jim Dear. The box moves, wiggles and whimpers, and Darling finds a little Cocker Spaniel puppy inside whom they quickly name Lady. Lady is soon an integral part of the family and has grown into a beautiful adult dog living a happy life following Darling around and waiting for Jim Dear to come home. When Darling has a baby, Lady initially feels neglected as she no longer receives the attention she once did. The Tramp, a mutt who makes it his practice to visit many of his adult friends on a weekly basis, stopping at the Italian restaurant one night, the deli the next, takes a liking to Lady. Darling's aunt comes to visit and take care of the baby while Jim Dear and Darling are away on a trip. Her two Siamese cats, Si and Am cause mischief and Lady gets into trouble and become banished to the dog house. Can the Tramp help her?<br /><br />Made in 1955, \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" is a beautiful, fun animated film, certain to please every one in the family. Thankfully, the DVD release features both a full screen and a widescreen version of the film. When the film was released, both anamorphic and academy prints were made available to theaters. Anamorphic films were created in an effort to battle the impending threat of television.  Watching the widescreen print, I was struck at how beautiful the film looks. The colors are crisp and bright, the images are believable and lifelike, and it just looks mesmerizing. This is the result of restoration done by the studio for this DVD.<br /><br />There are two more reasons why these Disney Platinum DVDs are so important for any family or film aficionado.<br /><br />In each of the Classic Disney films, the primary reason they are remembered today is because of the story. As subsequent generations watch the films, they are equally entranced by puppets brought to life, the plight of a deer, the story of a boy who would never grow up and two dogs who fall in love, in addition to the adventures of various kings, queens, princes and princesses. In the late 80s and early 90s, the studio enjoyed a resurgence creating a new batch of films with timeless stories. These films work because both audiences can enjoy them; the kids can enjoy the stories along with the adults. Because parents grew up with them, and loved them, they take their children to them or rent the DVDs for them, exposing a new generation to the magic of these films.<br /><br />The story is charming. It was a stroke of genius to set the story in Victorian America. Walt's childhood home of Marceline, Missouri seems to have been the setting, feeding off of the filmmaker's romanticized memories. Not only are the settings and backgrounds beautiful, but the depiction of a simpler time is beneficial to the story. Because there are fewer things going on, the relatively simple story has greater impact. The story also calls on familiar moments in our lives. Many people have received pets on Christmas day, a little box squirming around, with a pet wearing abow inside. Many people have dealt with jealousy and being blamed for something we didn't do. It all brings back memories of our childhood and of happier times, making the film all the more endearing.<br /><br />When the story does deviate from the traditional, it does so in an exceptional manner. When Lady arrives in the pound, her fear is palpable until she meets the other dogs, realizes they are all very nice and would do her no harm. This is also the opportunity for the filmmakers to introduce another song, \\"What a Dog!\\" by Peggy Lee. While the song doesn't exactly fit the setting, it is very memorable and enjoyable, introducing a very timely Jazz theme into the film. \\"The Siamese Cat Song\\" and \\"Bella Notte\\" only further enhance the musical heritage of this film. I think a large number of people who have never seen the film could at least tell you something about these songs.<br /><br />The film does have some racial stereotypes, but they don't seem offensive or mean-spirited. Any dog character uses the accent associated with their name. For instance, a Chihuahua has a Mexican accent, a wolfhound, Russian. Jock, a Scottish terrier, speaks with a heavy brogue, Rusty, an old bloodhound, speaks with a heavy Southern accent. Then, of course, there is Tony and his assistant. Because they are Italian chefs, they have heavy Italian accents. I think the key here is most of the characters involved play an integral part to the story. Tony is the host to Lady and Tramp's first date, including the very memorable and often spoofed spaghetti kiss. With the exception of the Chihuahua, none of the stereotypes seems mean-spirited or offensive. Perhaps you could use this as a platform to discuss this type of behavior with your kids and help them recognize why this practice is no longer PC.<br /><br />The Disney Platinum DVDs are like encyclopedias of information. They include deleted songs, storyboards, portions of Walt Disney television shows explaining techniques or promoting the films and much more. Each DVD title has a second disc containing a plethora of extras. Of course, the more recent titles have more extras, but the folks at Disney usually come up with at least two or three great finds, making these discs a great treasure for film historians.<br /><br />Disc Two features a lengthy documentary about the making of the film, covering everything from the origins of the story to the design of the characters to the different voices used for different characters. Each of the segments in this documentary can be watched separately or as part of a nearly hour long documentary. There are two particularly interesting extras featuring reconstructions of abandoned scenes and a different, extended version of the song \\"La La Loo\\". There are also the obligatory kids' games and excerpts from related Disney TV specials. There is a lot of information here and it will provide any film scholar with a good look at the making of this animated classic.<br /><br />\\"Lady and the Tramp\\" is a joy to watch, anywhere, anytime, anyplace. Since they seem to have stopped re-releasing the films in movie theaters, this DVD is the next best thing to watching it on the big screen.et wearing a bow inside.

Since they seem to have stopped re-releasing the films in movie theaters, this DVD is the next best thing to watching it on the big screen. <br />
B000E97Y6K|3.0|Peter Jackson's first movie since the Lord of the Rings trilogy is King Kong, which could have been great on so many levels.  What really killed the film experience for me was its length.  After watching it in the theater and then again on DVD, I was as disappointed as the first time.   <br /> <br />I will give the director his dues for production values - the special effects are extraordinary and his direction spot-on.  The fact that he was able make the relationship between the woman and Kong plausible and emotional should have earned him more credit. <br /> <br />Otherwise, the movie's alright.  At 3 hours, a lot of the film could have been cut (an EXTENDED version coming in November?!...) especially the (too) many staring sequences between the two.  A lot of the action was cool looking (the Kong and Rexes sequence is amazing) but some of it was totally unnecessary (the insect sequence grosses me to this day) and made it longer than it should have been. <br /> <br />While I know that I am one of the few who aren't praising the film completely, there are merits to it and it deserves to be seen just because of what he accomplished with the relationship. <br />Otherwise, it's just another Kong film.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|Everything is Illuminated is a bit of a mixed bag. It's a wildly uneven movie that starts off well, and is strafed with a sort of darkly comic irony, but soon descends into an under whelming and rather anemic road movie, where the resolution doesn't nearly pack as much of an emotional punch as it should. Consequently, the film doesn't really satisfy or illuminate. Maybe it has something to so with Live Schreiber's earnest and overly languid direction; there's a lot of warm eccentricity here, but not that much dramatic heft.  <br /> <br />Based on Jonathan Safran Foer's novel Everything is Illuminated, the film tells of New York writer Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood), who arrives in Odessa looking for the village of Trachimbrod, and a woman he thinks saved his late grandfather from the Nazis; he is helped by a hip-hop-obsessed young stud named Alex (Eugene Hutz). Alex lives in Odessa and helps to run a family company that drives rich Jews around Ukraine in search of their lost heritage. The car's driver is Alex's dyspeptic grandfather, also named Alex (Boris Leskin) an anti-Semite with a transparently guilty conscience.  <br /> <br />There's also the grandfather's dog Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. whom he claims to need as a seeing-eye dog, even though he's not blind, being the driver, whom Alex cheerfully calls \\"deranged,\\" and is actually the cutest thing about the movie. Schreiber wisely gives us lots of Alex and Sammy David Jr. because without their comic relief the film would probably be deadly dull.  <br /> <br />The charismatic Hutz - in his acting debut here - is about the best thing the film has going for it, especially when one considers the character of Foer. Sticking Wood in a black suit and nerd glasses to accentuate his big blue eyes, and have him walk around like a faulty android comes across as just too weird, This all may be meant to parody the stiffness of Foer, a quietly obsessive collector of family artifacts, but the character seems forced and doesn't sit well,but next to the film's other, wonderfully three-dimensional and realistic characters.  <br /> <br />The film is lovingly photographed; particularly the lush countryside, and the moments of dreamlike surreal images - a cabin surrounded by an improbably perfect field of giant sunflowers - are handled well. But there isn't enough drama here to sustain an entire film, and Schreiber's direction is just so relentlessly timid and overly cute. That lush soundtrack of traditional music is all right for about half an hour, but rapidly becomes irritating and swells up in all the wrong places.  <br /> <br />The ideas behind the movie are good - the importance of memory, history and heritage, holding onto the detritus of the past, the necessity of storytelling, and of sifting through and distilling and bringing the imagination to bear on one's past. But Schreiber isn't able to incorporate these ideas into a completely dramatic scenario that resonates with the viewer; consequently the movie remains abstract, rather closed, and almost wimpy. When the eponymous illumination comes and a secret is revealed, it's horrific, but also quite confusing, and even unexpectedly hackneyed. Mike Leonard March 06.  <br />
B00005JOFQ|3.0|I'm not sure why people are giving this 5 stars because BB definitely doesn't deserve that. <br /> <br />On the other hand, many that gave it 1 star (also undeserved) seemed to expect some action movie or blatant plot twist(s).  I was expecting something else, too, but found an elusive, though present, \\"plot\\" presented in a minimalistic style.  <br /> <br />It's set in the early 60s, so complaints about the characters \\"responsability\\" aren't really relevant. I suppose one must have been alive then or be acutely knowledgable about the era to compltely understand this aspect of the film. <br /> <br />BB is not a bad movie and, to it's credit, had me thinking about the story long after I left the theater (unlike most of today's  Hollywood offerings).  3 stars. <br /> <br />
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I think it sounds just as good as the original. I always thought Megadeth were better than the other 3 thrash bands(though all 4 of them are awesome). Dave Mustaine's vocals are pretty good, unlike some people have said. He is a master at guitar as well. He is constantly switching out between lead & rhythm with Marty Friedman, another godly guitarist. Those stupid emo kids in Hawthorne Heights wish they could play guitar like this. Dave Ellefson is a very underrated bassist, and I find him to be a master of it. Nick Menza is a great drummer as well. This album is technical, progressive laced thrash/speed metal.<br /><br />Track Ratings:<br /><br />Holy Wars...The Punishment Due:100/10<br />Hanger 18:1000/10<br />Take No Prisoners: 100/10<br />Five Magics:100/10<br />Poison Was the Cure:100/10<br />Lucretia:100/10<br />Tornado of Souls:100/10<br />Dawn Patrol:10/10<br />Rust in Peace..Polaris:100/10<br /><br />I didn't bother rating the extras.<br /><br />Score:1710/100<br /><br />This album is a masterpiece! If you like metal, this gem's for you. If you like emo, go cry in a corner and slit your wrists, because this album's too heavy for you, and it might break you in half.<br /><br />Long live Megadeth!<br /><br />Go jump off a cliff Hawthorne Heights!
B00005JOFQ|3.0|Is there anything wrong for telling my own opinion?  It is really ironic, they can make a movie showing their  genital area and nipples and I can not even talk about them!?    Come On! If it is a good movie, why every audience walked out   silently after watching this film? Were they overwhelmingly  touched by it? NO! Did they get a tremendously melancholic   emotion in their minds? NO! The reason was: THEY DID NOT FEEL  ANYTHING! No one could utter a negative comment about this   movie because almost all the press and critics praised this   movie so ridiculously, it is like you are a 'No Taste' person  if you dis it.    I have feelings towards many men in my life of 28 years, I know  how it feels about the love or fondness unable to be known, but  I just didn't see how they have developed such a \\"love\\" in   this \\"romantic\\" drama. It looked like Ennis was seduced by Jack  after he was drunk. and he kinda felt he should have been held   responsible to be Jack's good 'husband' so a strange \\"fishing   buddies\\" situation was maintained. According to the story line   of the film(not the novel), Ennis even didn't seek for Jack for  4 years! And Jack still went to get escorts to fufill his   physical needs even if after he and Ennis' reunion!    Can we call this 'LOVE'? It looked more like a long-term sex   relationship.    You can say you like this movie or not, just don't tell me it is  \\"A Story About Love\\"! Do not downgrade love to such an animal   level.    Another pity of this movie is Anne Hathaway; I love her very   much, but here again she is like an big wallflower in an   ugly wig showing her breasts...again. I don't even know what is   the meaning of her role.    There was a suprise while watching this movie, however, that was  Michelle Williams's performance. If there was anything touched   me during watching Brokeback Mountain, that was it. I could   feel the wife's pain and anger through her acting and thus made  me sympathized the situation the role confronted.    Nonetheless, it did not save Brokeback Mountain from being an   overhyped awards-winner. The sucess of this movie is based on   an international renown director and a good original story, and  most important, the promotion strategy of the company released it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I think it is important for all fans of music to understand the great importance and influence that the Beatles have had on everything since the 60's.  This does not translate, however, into an automatic affinity, and that is easy to understand.  What is good and what is bad is totally an opinion, and that is impossible to try to argue.  Chuck Berry preceded the Beatles and had a huge influence on the Fab Four, but many Beatles fans may not like or even know Chuck, and that's fine.  The Beatles took Berry's rock'n roll concept and took it to a totally completely different level that helped to enable the hard rock explosion of the 70's and different tangents related to rock from there on after.  However, it is very important to cite them as amjor influence and to not just throw them off as just some 60's pop band, because they were much more than that.  As for the music, it is amazing.  I actually just re-discovered this a few days ago and realized once again why I love the Beatles.  I am more of a fan of the later songs on the album because I personally like their experimental approach they took in the late 60's.  If you are interested in starting a Beatles collection or would just like a convenient source for 27 of their greatest singles, then this is the album for you.  But the Beatles are not, however, a band that everyone will like, but please just understand their importance to pop culture.  Also check out Plastic Ono Band by John Lennon for an album straight from the heart. <br /> <br />Rock on!
B00005JNQS|3.0|after the excellent \\"Ice Age\\" from this studio, I was really looking forward to \\"Robots\\".   <br /> <br />the 3D is excellent and the story starts off very promising (scene where they \\"make a baby\\" with parts), but quickly dissipated into...well, something that didn't hold my attention.  <br /> <br />the first sign this movie was going downhill was that stupid  Jack-in-the-Box character that guards the main city gates.  The animators must have beeen so desperate for footage that they refused to edit that long winded, unnecessary scene.  <br /> <br />dissapointing to say the least
B000AU1NY2|5.0|I love this cd however the only reason I bought the Japanese version was because it was supposed to have How You See The World as a bonus track and it does not. The bonus track is Pour Me. I was disappointed, as How You See The World is one of my favorite songs. Coldplay is THE BEST band in the world though so this cd is wonderful regardless of what the bonus track might be!!!
B000ENWKN8|5.0|Well what can one say this album is amazing.  This is what rock music was rob zombie.  All his songs on it are amazing.  My favorite songs are \\"The scorpion sleeps\\" and \\"Let it all bleed out\\" but all the songs are good.  If anyone is interested and if you have xm radio they are replaying a rob zombie interview with bodhi at 11am on thursday, check it out its really good.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I am personally glad that they went a little more main stream or I would of never discovered this album. It's a work of art and very uplifting. We need more artists out there like them. I'm a new fan in a big way. I think there should be more indie artists like them and Tim Kirker's \\"Like Distant Sounds\\" album. Recommended.
B000DWMYQ8|3.0|Although the 3D is top notch, the voice acting is marginal and the story is borderline ridiculous.   <br /> <br />Unlike Pixar movies, this has little to no inuendo and will only appeal to children (or very immature adults).  As far as strictly childrens movies are concerned I give it 4 stars- for anyone else I give it 2 stars.
0425152251|5.0|This is an excellent book by Gaarder. The writer holds us by the hand and leads us to the world of philosophy. He has conveyed the history of philosphy in the simplest mahnner. The difficult the topic was, the comprehensive it is in the book. Easy to grab,it creates an interest of philosophy . Recommended for students of fine arts and literature and a must for personnal collection.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I just bought this CD past Saturday and LOVE the soothing sounds that make up Celtic Music. Listening to these women can help ease the stress of the workday! My personal favorites on this CD, are \\"Someday\\" the song from the Disney hit movie \\"Hunchback of Norte Dame\\" and \\"One World\\" If you don't have this CD and love Celtic music, then get it when you get the chance.
0812550706|4.0|What I loved about Ender's Game was that the author, Card, created an amazing science fiction universe and filled it with deep, emotional characters. Characters that you can relate to, and that you like reading about. This is NOT a mindless story filled with human heads getting blown off my slimy green aliens. It is a very \\"smart\\" book, and it goes much deeper than your ordinary sci-fi adventure. <br />Ender's Game is a wonderful book for lovers of science fiction(there are plenty of wicked sci-fi battles and stuff like that)and for those who aren't crazy about the genre as well. I believe that everyone would get something out of this heartfelt, moving, adventure novel!
B000EHRVP6|4.0|In the same vein as SAW and SAW2. Disturbing ,violent stuff! Paxton (Jay Hernandez) is a total hottie!! Can't wait to see more of him.
0307276902|3.0|As one author said: There is a big difference between a recovering addict and a sober one. James Frey represents a person who hasn't worked through any issues to become sober.  he continues to possess the addict personality and behavior.  sure he may be sober but he hasn't changed the addict.  His anger is really just a facade for someone who doesn't want to deal with his addiction.  He acts like a tough ass by telling people to mind ther own f...ing business.  Is this truly a responsible recovering addict.  He never does blame anything or one for his addiction which is suprising for all the anger he holds in.  Is it surprising that he elaborated and manipulated the reader with his flamboyant art of the written word. That is what the addict is about: manipulation.
B00005JKES|5.0|I LOVED this release: <br /> <br />1.  EXCELLENT STORY <br />2.  Great DVD release ...Dolby Digital 5.1 AND DTS!!! Picture Quality was good too. <br />3.  David Lynch...enough said. <br /> <br />Now, I was disappointed at the lack of the pilot episode, I understand there was no avoiding this at the time.  They did, however, include a full page written summery of the pilot so you were not completely lost when you started viewing the DVD, which I thought was nice. <br /> <br />Now, we just need the pilot in a separate release (and not one of these crappy imports) as well as season 2.  Then I will be happy...
B00022TPTI|4.0|This is the album from the Ozzy era that tends to get panned the most.  The reason?  Coming off the heels of three superb bluesy and heavy classics, this album expanded their range a bit.  This has some mellotron, some piano, and some weird sound effects that normally are found on King Crimson albums.  Does that mean that this album is bad?  Nowhere near it.    1. Wheels of Confusion-5/5.  This one is a great choice for an opener.  The first thing that strikes you is that the production has a more psychedelic feel to it.  The lyrics are excellent and the music alternates between slow and heavy to  create an excellent track.  2. Tomorrow's Dream-5/5.  Not quite as heavy as most of the other songs from this era, this is still an excellent rocker with some great guitar playing and a flawless vocal from Ozzy.  3. Changes-5/5.  This is the song that most fans hate, but I happen to love it.  It consists of Ozzy, a piano and a mellotron.  The music is beautiful and Ozzy's vocals are very emotive.  Excellent.  4. FX-2/5.  Pointless sound experiment.  A sound collage that is absolutely unnecessary with no redeeming qualities at all.  5. Supernaut-5/5.  An upbeat, heavy rocker with a very psychedelic feel to it.  The lyrics are especially strange, but the vocals are excellent.  6. Snowblind-5/5.  Probably the best song on here.  The lyrics are about the dangers of using cocaine.  The vocals are flawless and the music is very well written and performed.  An excellent mid-tempo rocker.  7. Cornucopia-4/5.  The emphasis on the song is heavy guitar.  That is the thing that sticks out the most.  The vocals aren't particularly good and I can't really understand what is being sung, but the music is still very cool.  8. Laguna Sunrise-5/5.  An absolutely beautiful acoustic guitar instrumental.  Very atmsospheric.    9. St Vitus' Dance-3/5.  Not bad.  A heavy midtempo rocker with a repetitive fast guitar riff that gets a bit annoying.  Vocals and lyrics are simply average.  10. EveryDay Comes and Goes-5/5.  An excellent closing song with one of the coolest riffs ever as the song fades out.  Great lyrics and vocals from Ozzy.    Yes, this album is quite a bit different than the three that preceded it, but its not so far out of left field that it is without its merits.  I personally think it is an excellent album, but its not a good starting point.  Highly recommended for fans.
B000BHN7DE|5.0|Anastacia is...the worlds best kept secret! And this mix of greatest hits is the best way to join in on all the RAVE!
B0000042MY|5.0|This movie rates as my most favorite, but the music will stir your soul, I still get chill bumps listening to this music, as I can shut my eyes and be taken to another place. This has to rate as one of the all time best movie soundtracks ever made.
0393317552|4.0|The only reason I came across this book is because it was required reading materail for my tech ethics class. It's a very good book, very detailed and informational on this particular subject. It's a good read also. I would recommend it to anyone interested in this field.
B00022TPSY|5.0|There is a reason why many people, fans and non-fans alike, put this album in their greatest albums of all time list.  It is simply a complete masterpiece.  The truth is that the first six albums by Black Sabbath are all 5 star quality without a single weak song on any of them.  However, \\"Paranoid\\" stands out as the best of that group. <br /> <br />1. War Pigs-5/5.  Another one of those \\"everybody knows this one\\" songs.  Excellent lyrics about politicians who make war for profit.  Not exactly an anti-war song.  The music is superb and the vocals by Ozzy are haunting.  Perfect. <br />2. Paranoid-5/5.  This is the classic rock radio song.  It gets played on every classic rock station across the nation at least once a day.  Fast paced rocker with great lyrics and vocals. <br />3. Planet Caravan-5/5.  Beautiful atmospheric song with bongo drums and acoustic guitar.  The vocal effects make this song very haunting.  It is a totally unique listening experience.  Pantera's version is also great. <br />4. Iron Man-5/5.  The song that cemented Iommi's reputation as the ultimate riff-master, and he hasn't been dethroned yet.  One of the wildest and heaviest guitar riffs ever.  Weird sci-fi lyrics with great vocals. <br />5. Electric Funeral-4/5.  Another great song.  Excellent heavy riff with some great gloom and doom lyrics.  The only downfall to this is Ozzy's vocals.  They aren't as perfect as they are on the rest of the songs.  Still great, though. <br />6. Hand of Doom-5/5.  Great bass line from Geezer.  Slow and soft in the beginning that quickly turns heavy and sinister with another spectacular vocal performance from Ozzy. <br />7. Rat Salad-3/5.  The one and only weak link on the album.  An instrumental that isn't particularly great, but not too bad either.  Thankfully, it's very short, so there is no real need to pass it. <br />8. Fairies Wear Boots-5/5.  An earlier reviewer said this song was about neo-Nazis.  I've never heard that before.  My impression was that this was about an LSD trip that Geezer had, but I don't know that for sure.  Whatever the case, the lyrics are weird, but the vocals are perfect and the music is quite trippy. <br /> <br />All in all, this is one of those few albums that actually comes close to complete perfection.  No one with any appreciation of music, especially rock, should be without it.
0812548094|5.0|In my opinion Stone of Tears is one of the best books I've read since Harry Potter, and it is easily better in my own opinion. Still, I do not understand why so many people are more interested in Harry Potter, perhaps though, it's just because most people don't find this book commonly. <br /> <br />This book is based around middle ages, but it is really hard to tell. A summary would be to say that a great Underworld overlord called the Keeper is trying to get out and take over the mortal world. The stone that can keep him from doing this though, is on a young girl. The two main characters, Kahlan, the Mother Confessor, and Richard, the Seeker and War Mage, are separated. And their nemesis, Darken Rahl, or Richard's biological father, has come back from the Underworld and is trying to help the keeper get out, with the help of the Imperial Legion. <br /> <br />In the end, the two main characters are re-united, and the world is once again safe from the Keeper. <br />
B000ENWKN8|1.0|I think it is going down hill for our Zombie god. This album is really lame. It all sounds very calculated and safe, unlike most of his past work. Very disappointed Rob. I always looked forward to the new Zombie albums, White and Rob, but this absolute re-hashed, unispired American Idol fan base directed stuff. Don't serve two masters Rob. Give us back the Zombie we love. The cover is Hellbilly Deluxe minus the Zombie, if that is any indication.

B00022TPT8|5.0|How do you top \\"Paranoid?\\"  That had to be the question that was often hurled at the members of Black Sabbath in 1971.  For me, the answer must have been, you don't.  So let's not try to top it and do what we want to do.  That is what Sabbath continued to do up through \\"Sabotage.\\"  While \\"Paranoid\\" might have been the closest to perfection, all of these albums are 5 star quality and \\"Master of Reality\\" holds up right along side them all, although it was the shortest and probably the least known.    1. Sweet Leaf-5/5.  One of the bands most beloved songs.  The lyrics are about marijuana opening up the mind to a heightened sense of awareness.  The riff is alow and chugging, and this was an early hint at the psychedelic sounds that the band would later experiment with.  2. After Forever-5/5.  The best song on the album by far.  This one is an upbeat rocker.  The lyrics are great with an attack on atheism.  The music is superb with constant changes going in several different directions.  Perfect!  3. Embryo-4/5.  An interesting but rather pointless guitar instrumental track.  It's about 35 seconds long and segues right into the next track.  Not bad.  4. Children of the Grave-5/5.  One of Sabbath's heaviest ever.  Tribal drums add to an already heavy percussive song.  The lyrics are great and the vocals are perfect.  5. Orchid-4/5.  An acoustic finger picking guitar instrumental.  Pretty, like \\"Embryo,\\" its a bit unnecessary, but not bad.  6. Lord Of This World-5/5.  Another great super heavy riff with more great vocals.  Slow and gloomy with some weird lyrics.  Excellent!  7. Solitude-5/5.  Similar to \\"Planet Caravan,\\" this one is an underrated gem.  Slow and soft with some of the most beautiful guitar work this side of Pink Floyd.  Perfect.  8. Into the Void-5/5.  Another great riff.  Heavy and driving, this is an excellent way to close the album.  Excellent lyrics and vocals.    As I stated previously, you can't go wrong with any of the first 6 Black Sabbath albums.They are all unique in their own way.  My only complaint about this one is the two short, but useless instrumentals and the fact that it is considerably shorter than the rest.  It is still just as good as the rest of the albums.  Highly recommended.
B000EDWL82|4.0|There are lots of bands doing 80s Brit-rock these days: The Killers, Interpol, The Bravery. But here's a novel idea, how `bout Brit-rock from a band that is actually (gasp) British! Hailing from Birmingham these four former Stafford University students have had the U.K press buzzing about their 2005 debut disc The Back Room. Well after months of waiting, The Editors have finally hit the U.S. market.  <br /> <br />I will tell you right now I love this disc. I have had it in my play rotation for four solid months (I got it as an import). Yes, they sound a bit like Interpol from the standpoint that both singers have that deadpan sort of Joy Division style going. But I think that The Editors' Tom Smith brings more of a flow and less of a drone to the music. His baritone voice fits in nicely with the overall minor key mood of the songs and never tries to go where it shouldn't.   <br /> <br />A more apt comparison of the Editors' sound is to that of 80s alternative bands The Chameleons U.K., Cactus World News and Echo & The Bunnymen. Soaring and edgy guitars layered with just enough minor chords and shadows of goth to be cool but not too depressing. The guitar firepower is not in flashy solos but in mood building chords that instantly catch you and keep you focused and hooked. <br /> <br />\\"Lights\\" comes hard and fast right out of the gate while Smith croons, \\"I've got a million things to say.\\" The bass and drums lay down a blistering pace and the guitars reverb up a storm of melody. Hot on the heels is \\"Munich,\\" with more of the same guitar power and passion. By this point in the disc you will have already decided whether you love them or not.  <br /> <br />The beat keeps driving but the lyrics turn a bit darker on \\"Blood.\\" As Smith's warbling voice sings, \\"Blood runs through your veins / That's where our similarity ends.\\" Lies, promises and trust are all themes here. \\"There's nothing believable in being honest / So cover your lies up / With another promise.\\"  <br /> <br/>Another high point is \\"All Sparks\\" with it's repeating chorus hook of \\"all sparks will burn out in the end\\" sung over dark guitar and a slightly slower heavy bass. It reminds me a bit of Bauhaus. Smith belts this song out like an anthem. To top it off he also adds, \\"You burn like a bouncing cigarette...all sparks will burn out.\\"  <br /> <br />The first big noise from The Editors was with the U.K. single \\"Bullets,\\" which sold out in a single day. Once again we get a soaring guitar hook with the fast-paced lyrics, \\"You don't need this disease / You don't, you don't need this disease.\\" Here in print it may not seem that cool but believe me, when you hear it you will be instantly sold.  <br /> <br />The lads also do well when they slow the pace down a bit. \\"Fall\\" and \\"Camera\\" both show off the band's ability to deliver intensity and passion without all the guitar bombast. But make no mistake, both songs continue to build throughout and churn up a good guitar noise before they finish. It's a very 80s throwback touch indeed.  <br /> <br />But the best of the slow jams is without a doubt, \\"Open Your Arms.\\" A little pop of drums starts it off very nicely and the guitars are very understated. After a couple of catchy verse - chorus exchanges the guitar begins to echo and the bass starts pounding as the drums get louder and louder. Smith howls above it all, \\"Open your arms and welcome / Open your arms and welcome...people to your town.\\" The disc really should end right here.  <br /> <br />\\"Distance,\\" is the last track and while it is not a bad song it just doesn't have the power of \\"Open Your Arms.\\" It is a minor quibble and certainly does not diminish the disc's overall appeal.  <br /> <br />The Editors are not perfect on their debut. There is still plenty of room to grow and develop, especially in the lyrics department. Most every song here has a great line or two. So we know they have it within them to come up with really good lyrical hooks. Their next challenge will beto string a bunch of those lines together in a single song. They really didn't do that this time out but I am more than willing to give them a chance to work on it.  <br /> <br />The Editors deliver the big, bold minor chord anthem better than any of their contemporaries. As I listen to this disc I can envision these songs sung like stadium rock anthems ala U2. I also know that right now they are a long way from that status and only time will tell where they go. Here's hoping that the Editors find the kind of success that they deserve. Like I said before, I love this disc.  <br /> <br />R#
B000E97Y6A|4.0|I must say this film was by far one of best movies I have seen all year. Great spec effects, I love how the ape was protrayed as a real natural. It was a little emotional at the end.  All the ape wanted to do was to be at peace, return to the wild and, nuture his beauty queen. It was awesome! I can't complain. You want a good recipe? By all means: add 2 cups of King Kong, 1 cup of popcorn, and 1/2 cup of soda. Mix all the ingredients together and presto! you have a great movie that you can enjoy with or without the ones you love!
B000EOTAM6|5.0|I had no idea I would love this move as much simply because I heard it got some bad reviews, I'm not a Chalize Theron fan and I have never watched the original cartoon. Man I was wrong, to heck with all the negative rubbish, I love it!  <br /> <br />The film itself is pure fantasy captured on the screen. I felt transported to another world for the time it took me to absorb the story and on a minor vain note I ended up loving Aeon's hairdo- do, it was awesome! <br /> <br />Aeon is the equivalent of a bounty hunter in this movie, as she is a part of rebel group called the Monicans. She has a secret mission to kill Goodchild, the chairman who oversees the last surviving place called Bregna as he rules with other scientists. Since 99% of the population was killed by a virus, he is in charge and Aeon with her rebellion are about to change that.  <br /> <br />What I loved, other than the fantastic costumes and surreal landscapes was the twists and turns in the story! This reminded me of those books I read and loved, when you didn't really know who the bad guy was and that was really going on. You must pay attention as a lot goes! Aeon and Goodchild are caught in a game of cat and mouse and it was enticing to see how they were connected and what the truth would do. <br /> <br />The twist start when Aeon if faced with fleeting memories of a previous life that keep her from fulfilling her mission and as the truth is revealed to her, she changes the future of Bregna with the equivalent of taking the bottom block of the foundation out. She lets all the skeletons loose as she jumps, shots, cartwheels, slinks through the night, paralyzes and disarms army men and fights for the truth of her and her people. <br /> <br />As I said, I'm not a die hard fan, I've never even seen the series and I absolutely let the movie swallow my brain and possess my interest till the end credit. I loved it, cant wait to own the DVD so I can pop it in when I have a sweet tooth for some sweet , eccentric and off-the-wall action.
B0007M22TI|4.0|Celtic Woman the DVD, I enjoy when I'm in the mood of entertaining. The soothing music of \\"Old Irish\\" and the brilliant scenes produced by David Downes accent the women of Celtic Woman.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have listened to this soundtrack more times than I can count and the songs just get better each time I listen to it!  Both leads (Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenowith) are absolutley breathtaking in their performances as Elphaba-the wicked witch of the west (Idina Menzel) and Glinda-the good witch of the north (Kristen Chenowith).  Both lead women have big, gorgeous voices and every song they sing, you can tell that they really put their heart and soul into every note!  This has become my favorite CD and it is by far the best musical soundtrack that I have ever heard!
B0007GAEGC|4.0|Celtic Woman the CD, I enjoy listening too while on my computer. The soothing relaxing music of \\"Old Irish\\" sung by Celtic Woman allow me to excape the hum-drum of everyday life. <br />
B000EGFVQS|4.0|In reading other reviews of this book, it made me realize that this book may only touch certain people the way that it touched me. Towards the end, I found myself with tears rolling down my face a few times as I easily found myself relating to the turmoil the Salmon family was going through. But then again, I had a brother who passed away far too soon and I experienced the affect that had on myself and my family every single day. I knew exactly the emotions every person in that family was feeling. <br /> <br />The story is very well written. I am not much of a reader at all but I finished this book in two sittings. It was hard to put down. Unlike another person who gave a review on this book, I did not find it depressing at all. The family did fall apart in the years after Susie's death, but that is just a reality. The hope came when her mother came back from California, after 10 or so years of trying to forget about her daughters death. 10 years of being away from a husband and two children and a house that were a constant reminder of her first born who lay dead somewhere, never to be found. She came home and fell in love with her family all over again. The hope was when her father and sister were finally able to let her go. It took over 10 years, but the grief was finally lifted. <br /> <br />The thing that inspired me most about this book was the idea of the dead being able to watch over us and stand among us. The idea that they watch us every day to see what decisions we make. They are happy for us in times of joy. They want so badly to be with us again. But they are content being in heaven. A place where their surroundings are all that they ever dreamed of or wanted when they were on Earth. This book gave me hope that my brother is with me every day, watching over me and that his heaven is way better than what we have here on Earth.
B000BNX3B4|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this film is FAR from horrible BUT it's far from unique either.  It's very predictable and very familiar.  Actually, it's so predictable that during a scene my wife said \\"I bet in the next scene she'll be in  the bathtub\\" and sure enough, she was.  The film has it's moments, both funny and sweet but there was just not enough to it to keep me wanting to care.  Diane Lane, as I've said before, is a brilliant actress who commands her roles, and she does that here even when she doesn't have much to work with.  I've always been a fan of John Cusack as well so as far as I was concerned the acting was great (all except Christopher Plummer who really got on my nerves)  Diane plays Sarah, a recent divorcee (8 months) who's family is very pushy in that she should get out in the dating world...so pushy that her sister actually puts her on a dating website.  Jake's (Cusack) divorce has just went through and his friend/lawyer is trying to hook him up as well and so he answers Sarah's add that she didn't write and tells Jake to meet her in the park...and they meet...and even though it all goes wrong theres just something there...but theres someone else.  A father to one of Sarah's students is seperated and wanting to pursue Sarah, and she's flattered.  So she has to choose.  And then bad things happen and feelings get hurt and all goes wrong, but as all romantic comedies go, theres a happy ending.  As I said, not terrible, but not great...but if your a fan of Lane or Cusack and are in the mood for a movie you've never seen, although it's been done before, pick this up and enjoy.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|I'll be honest from the get-go-- this movie changed my life. I'm a married woman who has been wrestling with her sexuality for years ( I realize that now). My husband is a wonderful man, he even went to see BBM with me in the theatre and liked it. But, I've also had a relationship with my best friend (a woman in another state), and this movie made me realize that I'm Ennis and she's my Jack and that what we have between us is even more than my marriage. Luckily, my husband understands.  <br /> <br />For those of you who have not experienced a love like Ennis and Jack, I pity you. For those who have, you know the heartbreak and pain it can cause. This movie isn't just a movie to me-- it's my life, right up there on the big screen.I thank Ang Lee, Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger, and all the others associated with this movie who took the biggest chance you can possibly take in Hollywood and came out shining. Kudos to all of you! <br /> <br />And for those of you who have commented on the infidelity aspect, may I ask, did you like Titanic? Did you swoon and cry over the Bridges of Madison County? Well, my friend, your hypocrisy is showing. Meryl Streep's character cheated on her husband, and Rose cheated on her fiance with Jack. So, what's the difference? <br /> <br />I am not justifying infidelity. I know firsthand the pain it can cause, and I would take it back if I could and handle it differently.  <br /> <br />This movie changed my life.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|Hugh Jackman has the confidence to make this movie enjoyable. Kate Beckinsale and Hugh had chemistry and you could tell they enjoyed working with each other. The rest of the cast were wonderful too, the entire show was just one twist and turn and it all fell into place.  At the end when they were riding their horses past (what appeared to be) Stonehenge, it was almost as if you could imagine that Stonehenge was THE DOOR to Dracula's Lair !!  I enjoyed this movie very much- buy the DVD so you can watch the out takes and how the movie was made - just great stuff!
B000021YQV|5.0|This is my favorite System of a Down album.  It's got several singles you've probably heard on the radio, and a few others that I think are even better than those.  Unlike many albums I've purchased in recent years, there's not a loser on this disc.  It's well worth the price.
0689865384|5.0|i love this book it is my top 5 fav books i am reading pretties right now i want to be done with it and read the 3rd book but the 3rd book doesnt come out untill may 9th ahh if anyone is thinking bout reading this read it every one should read this no matter how old or if ur a guy or a girl its bout being urself and being a great friend also falling in love on the way.
B000069HK2|5.0|A simply amazing band. An equally amazing C.D. Bert McCracken may just be the only person who can truly pull off the whole Sing/Scream thing without being overwhelming or tuneless. All the songs are entirely unique, yet manage to form together into one big mass of stripped-down screamo that broke (and continues to break) the boundaries of what music 'should' or 'shouldn't' sound like. Considering the wide range of backgrounds, personalities, and yes, futures, of these kids, the band, as well as the sound, is incredibly close-knit. To me, the Used sound like they have been making music for years and years, unlike so many other bands just starting off. I have had this C.D. for a while now, listened to it almost every day, and I will never get tired of it. Overall a truly good effort, worth paying retail for, if you have to. &lt;3<br /><br />~M.
B00007M5CO|1.0|I agree with the fellow who used the word Muzak to describe this nonsense.  It has all the feel of elevator music made for a business park in suburban Buenos Aires.  In fact it made me rethink my feelings about the Gotan Project, which has one or two good cuts to its credit with the rest of its output being similar drivel.  Honestly, begin with Tango Zero Hour by Piazzola and you will never tolerate garbage like the Bajafondo Tango Club.
B000068IEU|2.0|Like so many reviewers on this site, I came into this movie with reviews in mind claiming it to be one of the most terrifying horror films of all time. Not a good way to go into this film. At all.<br /><br />With the exception of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (which is a brilliant and honestly numbing film to watch, and frankly, far superior to this one), horror does not seem to be a genre that ages particularly well. Not that my problems with it are technological in nature. The killings are fairly believable, especially considering the limited budget, no glaring special effects shortfalls here. Maybe this movie, as a pioneer in modern American horror movies, simply didn't understand what tone to take with the film, as the narrative is noticeably schizophrenic. Imagine darting between a scene of a brutal rape and murder of a young girl, and two plucky small town policemen walking down a country road before talking to an aged black woman whose sisterness would be enough to embarrass Queen Latifah, all to the soundtrack of something out of Dukes of Hazzard. Well that, minus the black woman, who appears only once, represents a sizable portion of this film.<br /><br />I wouldn't describe that sort of scene as scary or horrific. Odd certainly, and if surrealism was the filmmakers' intent, then they succeeded, however absurdity and surrealism were not what I had been told to expect. Had I come into this film with a more open mind, I think I would have enjoyed it more. As it is, the movie feels clunky, and more than a little uncertain of where it wanted to go and what it wanted to say.not. In the future, don't bother adding such useless remarks to a review.  I didn't give \\"Office Space\\" a crappy review because it contained \\"totally uncalled for and gratuitous levels of humor\\". It's a comedy. Expect humor.
B0000508U6|5.0|Rarely have I seen such controversy in reviews over one artist.  What is more amazing is that much of the controversy has to do with the genre of the group rather than quality or style of the music.  The music on this CD is interesting and enjoyable, especially if you like Coldplay and \\"Parachutes\\" or not.  Coldplay is listed as alternative, but alternative has pop variations and I would classify this music generally as pop or perhaps pop-alternative.  That this music appears on the Hot 100 and Adult Top 40 charts would seem to confirm the tendency toward pop.  I also think this CD has a grunge feel to it as well.  If you feel a need to become argumentative about whether Coldplay is pop, grunge or alternative, I would say you have too much time on your hands.<br /><br />This CD opens with a song that reminds me a lot of the Cranberries' early music.  \\"Don't Panic\\" is just a tight little song that sounds as though it should be five minutes long rather than a bit more than two minutes.  The song has a great refrain and catchy music that makes you beg for more; a very nice opening song on this 2000 debut CD.<br /><br />The mellow and melancholy continues with \\"Shiver.\\"  There is a catchy guitar hook in this song that is used sufficiently sparingly that I kept hoping to hear it again.  This love song has some high vocals and a slightly heavy beat.  The pace also speeds up during portions of the song.  I enjoy this song, which was released as a single and hit #26 in the U.S. on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, but I think this CD contains even better music.<br /><br />I enjoy the third song a lot.  \\"Spies\\" has paranoia and melancholy and will be a perfect soundtrack song when someone gets around to recognizing the fact.  The vocals on this song are excellent, and the music is very competently supportive.  I must admit that this combination of vocals and music I have enjoyed from other artists, so I am partial to this song regardless of its other attributes.<br /><br />The slow, heavy \\"Sparks\\" is a bit too ponderous to be one of my favorites.  The song is bluesy and melancholy, but I prefer the lighter tracks over this one.  The music is nice and easy, and I could have listened to this track without the vocals.<br /><br />The song \\"Yellow\\" has received a good amount of airplay, and reached #6 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.  I like the honesty of this love song, and the often surreal feeling we sometimes have when we are so in love that we are unable to describe the feelings of love.  The song is so sincere and heartfelt that it can send shivers down my spine.  I love a well-executed love song, and this one verges on being a great rock love song.<br /><br />Coldplay ventures into territory executed well by but a few artists as they center \\"Trouble\\" on a piano.  Here is a song that could easily have been at home with several artists, including Billy Joel, Elton John and Dan Fogelberg.  The vocals are what set this song apart from those other artists.  The song is bluesy and emotional and melancholy, and the singer brings you into his world of regret and desire and moments lost in a \\"web for me.\\"<br /><br />\\"Parachutes\\" is very short, less than one minute, and is almost an intermission between the first and second halves of the CD.  The song is all acoustic and very mellow.  I must admit to being clueless as to where the word \\"parachute\\" fits into this song, but maybe I am getting too old to understand some poetic allusions.<br /><br />Remember earlier in this review when I talked about genres?  The song \\"High Speed\\" kicks straight into alternative, and even has moments of progressive.  The introduction to this song is mellow within the context of this album, but the ethereal elements, the guitar chords and synthesizer are marvelously innovative and clever.  The lyrics seem to refer to the pace of our lives and our often frequent feeling that we are not in control of how fast we slide down the slippery slope.  The song alternates between mellow moments and more dramatic moments with some semi-power vocals that make this song quite unlike any other song on this CD.  I suppose you can tell I really like this song.<br /><br />Keeping in topic with the previous song is \\"We Never Change.\\"  The lyrics of this song express a desire to live simply.  The line \\"I wanna live where the sun comes out\\" expresses to me the desire to live in the country, assuming that either tall buildings or pollution obscures the sun in a large city.  The languid pace of the song also implies a bucolic setting.  This song is almost too slow, and near the end I thought it struggled to finish out.<br /><br />The final song on this CD is the longest on this CD, clocking in at over seven minutes.  This song is morosely sung, and yet the words are modestly hopeful.  The music is relatively simple and catchy.  The instruments provide musical accents rather than overwhelming the song.  There are moments when the music verges on progressive, and yet resists the temptation to slide across the boundary.  This song also contains marvelous blues elements and provides the album with a flavor quite different from the remainder of the music in the album.<br /><br />Coldplay hit big with this debut release.  The CD hit #1 in the UK and #2 in the U.S., and won the 2002 Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album.  Three singles from this CD hit the charts in the U.S., and four singles hit the charts in the UK.  By any measure Coldplay is a group that deserves your notice, particularly if you like good music, and most especially if you like mellow alternative, pop or blues.

B000E97Y6K|3.0|I'm really split on how I feel about this movie. Did I like it? By and large, yes. Was it as good as I was expecting? Unfortunately, no. I think the problem I had with it is the story arc is just too simple to be made into a three hour epic. There were several times I said to myself \\"enough with the CGI creatures and crawlies, let's get on with the story.\\" I'm becoming more and more convinced that CGI is too powerful a tool for most movie makers to handle. There simply isn't enough restraint while using it. Peter Jackson should have stuck with the LOTR movies, as they were more in the nature of an epic storyline. Kong felt like a movie being forced into an epic, as if Peter Jackson felt he had to follow in his own footsteps. If you're looking to kill three hours while being mildy entertained, then Kong is a good choice.
0790731509|1.0|Sorry to be the skunk at the garden party, which for some reason seems to be becoming my wont.  But if you are to analyze this movie objectively, I think you'd agree that it pretty much sucks.  I know you're thinking: \\"What?!?  How can anyone say anything so outrageous!  It's a *classic*!\\"  Hear me out.<br /><br />First, Newman isn't very believable.  It's not just that he's too good-looking to be on a chain gang.  It's not that he's a lousy actor.  He's not, he's a great actor.  It's just that in this movie his acting is lousy.  Think of the scene where Luke is broken by the guard after digging a hole and being beaten.  Even a high school drama teacher would blush at that kind of overacting.  It's embarrassing.<br /><br />Another annoying thing is the stage play (placement of actors within the shot).  The movie was done in the style that I thought had died out by 1967, but apparently hadn't.  It's a stagey, overly-dramatic style that kills any verisimilitude (it's also the sole problem I have with \\"The Searchers\\").  A group of people are lined up on one side of the screen while observing the action on the other side.  It's very unrealistic.  After seeing this in the jailhouse among the inmates three of four times, I began to expect at any moment that the other inmates, being grouped together like that, would burst into a rendition of \\"New York, New York, it's a Helluva Town!\\"<br /><br />I also didn't like Newman's character.  I know that a movie like this needs to be understood within its own cultural milieu, and 1967 was a very turbulent time, with lots of people feeling good about fighting the Pow-uh in a lot of really stupid ways.  But stupid acts of public destruction are just that, not the archetype of an individual's struggle against the Man.<br /><br />And heavy handed.  Jeez.  Lying him out on a table like he's been crucified?  Dressing in white?  Could you *be* more obvious?<br /><br />Overall, a really obnoxious, poorly-executed and shallow presentation on a number of levels.  By the end of the movie, I was cheering for the guard with the mirrored glasses to put an end to both Luke's misery and my own.entation on a number of levels.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|By far Mr. Gilmour's most creative work since 'Momentary Lapse'. <br />Aptly named also, as the music is spacious yet confined at times. Brilliant, fresh guitar work from Gilmour- who is the only man on earth who owns that sound... Lyrics fit perfect for each song... Kudos to Sampson. Get it now, even if you're not a big Floyd fan, its worth having.
B000002KIQ|5.0|Yes, Ry is a wonderful guitar player.  And, yes, the material is well chosen.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes to all the other reviews.  But let's give a hand to the arranger, as well.  Within the first few notes after placing the 12\\" LP of Jazz on my turntable many years ago, I was scrambling to find who did the arranging!    Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be Joseph Byrd who was the leader of the 60s rock groups, The United States of America and Joe Byrd and the Field Hippies (The American Metaphysical Circus).  (He was also put out a great synthsizer album on John Fahey's Takoma label.)  Joe Byrd and Ry Cooder make magic together out of their deep love for the mongrel musical cultural that has taken the world by storm over that last 100 years!  It is a high point of our popular music.    One note of caution, if are looking for a historically accurate recreation of classic Jazz, look elsewhere!  That sort of thing has nothing to do with the real spirit of Jazz that you will find here!  Enjoy!
B00005JOUM|4.0|I am a big Spike Lee fan and this movie was well done. I love when Denzel and Spike Lee hook up because they make great movies.

Great movie Spike!
B00000ING2|5.0|I honestly have to say that this movie gets better every time I watch it.  Is the plot unrealistic? Sure.  Are the characters over the top? Absolutely.  Is everything I mentioned intended to be that way? YES!  This is a story about inspiration and dreams, corporate corruption, power hungy executives, hardnosed reporters and the fact that some people actually have a heart if you look hard enough.  If you did not enjoy this movie then I recommend you look at it one more time.  These are stereotype characters, parodies of reality.  The naieve rube, the conniving businessman, the \\"anything for a story\\" reporter, and a little bit of sand, to make the experience more enjoyable.

1577311523|4.0|I'm surprised by the number of reviewers who expect to become \\"enlightened\\" simply by reading a book. Anyone who has spent time studying the Eastern philosophies that Tolle draws from would understand that ultimate \\"Truth\\" cannot be demonstrated or given, it can only be pointed towards. And Tolle does just that. It's no wonder that so many Western readers would have a hard time digesting what he is trying to say. We are goal oriented, always looking forward, our thoughts behind us and in front of us in the past and the future. To stop and live in the moment might even seem ridiculous.<br /><br />To live in the \\"Now\\" means just that. The past is gone and the future has not come (paraphrasing the Buddha). We cannot go into the past and when the future gets here, it is simply the \\"Now,\\" the only thing that has ever existed. The real message here is to get your happiness from what is happening right NOW, this moment. Don't place contentment in the future: \\"I'll be happy when I get a nice car. Things will be better when I get that promotion. I'd be complete if I could only meet someone.\\"<br /><br />Try to imagine just \\"being,\\" that is to see the world as we once did when we were children. Remember that time when everything we saw, felt, smelled, and sensed was amazing and curious? But as adults, we've rationalized away the true awesomeness of being into a word like \\"tree\\" or \\"cloud.\\" But what do we really understand about these things beyond the concepts we've placed on them? To be lost in and controlled by one's thoughts is like being caught in a river, or as Siddhartha said, to become a \\"leaf in the wind.\\" Without the right understanding, you have no control over how the events in your life affect you, good or bad.

0684833395|4.0|There is a place in a world where irony meets comedy, courts it, marries it and from this marriage reality is born. This world is called \\"Catch-22\\" by Joseph Heller. In this land of probabilities a narrative encircles a reality (like a ball encircles roulette's bowl before landing on a lucky number for some or a cursed one for others) before revealing the final results. And in the process of encircling, the same narrative paints characters out of the white pages with the colors of stories full of absurdities, and in spite of these absurdities these characters represent parallel witnesses of real personalities - the ones in our own reality.<br /><br />The more I read the book, the more I discovered how Heller's world complements mine, how it reflects it like a mirror as it examines the meaninglessness of war, name, rank, serial number, order, death, economy, capitalism, love, sex, religion (and not necessarily in the same order) and several other highly regarded objects of (im)moral value, and in this reflection it condemns them.<br /><br />Initially, I thought everyone in this novel was crazy. Then, I thought Heller was crazy. In the end I found out that it's the (I) reader who is crazy, that the world (I) he lives in is crazy, the job (I) he does is crazy, the aspirations (I) he holds are crazy, the mind (I) he tries to expand is crazy, and yet it feels good, and sacred, and meaningful, and happy, and cuddly, because (I) he makes it to be so, and because others say it is, and because (I) he is never going to be Youssarian (although secretly (I) he dreams of becoming like him).<br /><br />For those of you who don't have time to delve into the story completely I recommend the movie. Otherwise, the book is a must read.<br /><br />-by Simon Cleveland

0670824399|5.0|In this story a little girl named Matilda was brilliant, though her parents did not care for her. When she was about six she read newspapers and chapter books, while her parents watched television all day. One day, Matilda went up to her father and asked him if she could go to school. He replied saying that school is a waste of time and what do you need it for, but in the end they let her go to school, so they could get rid of her. So when she went to school the next day she found out that she was one of the smartest girls in her class. So days passed and one day Mrs. Trenchble, the school principle, came into the class and asked them a lot of questions. She was being really rood to Matilda's teacher, and to all of the students. She was known to hurt the kids who disobeyed her. One day, she was getting on Matilda's nerves and she got so mad that she made water splash on Mrs. Trenchble with her brain. So then when she got home everyday she would usually pull a trick on her parents for not caring for her. She put glue in her dads gel, and she also did other tricks to them. Matilda and her teacher became really close, almost like best friends. One day, Matilda went to her house and they talked for hours. They talked so much that they began to love each other. Matilda's teacher told Matilda that Mrs. Trenchble was her aunt. That was why she was so mean to her. In the end, Matilda and her teacher ended up living together. She adopted Matilda and lived happily ever after.  <br /> One thing I did not like about Matilda was that her parents did not like or cared for her. I don't think that any parent should not like their child. I did not like in the book when Matilda's father said, \\"Who needs to go to school? \\" I think that they should not have said that too her because it is making her think she doesn't need school, and everybody needs to go to school. I also did not like how Mrs. Trenchble treated her students. She was very mean to all of them, and even including Matilda's teacher.  <br /> My Favorite part of Matilda was when Matilda and her teacher just sit and talk and talk for hours. I think that they were meant to be once they saw each other. Matilda deserves a mom who can help her and be there for her and I know she can do it. I also love the ending because the ending is always the best part of the whole story. This is my favorite book. I love all the books Rauld Dahl has read.  <br />
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I've seen the previous version with Colin Firth and have read the book - my personal opinion of this rendition of one of history's finest pieces of literature is that Jane Austen would be turning in her grave if she were forced to sit through this tiresome and pityful movie. The actors for the principal characters ill-chosen and clearly not capable of doing justice to the complexity of their literary personalities: Keira Knightley cannot even begin to fill the shoes of the fiercely defiant and headstrong Elizabeth Bennet, and Matthew Macfadyen's ridiculously poor portrayal of Mr. Darcy pales in comparison to that of Colin Firth. Moreover, the movie completely fails to capture essential high-lights of the story, limps through the development of major relationships between characters, and in general is more tediously boring than any period drama in recent Hollywood history. A COMPLETE HIT-AND-MISS!

1400062071|5.0|After turning the last page of Liz Strout's Abide with Me, I wanted to shut down the outside world and hold on to the ending, savoring my time spent in West Annett (with a generous cast of very real, fascinating characters), in the way that only the best books can make us do. Strout's richly drawn characters and her beautiful, graceful prose held me in thrall to the end. And the end! Such a wonderful ending. If you had told me that I would read a book about a small town preacher from the 50's and that my hands would literally be sweating with anxiety over a long awaited give-em-hell sermon that I was absolutely dying for him to give, I would have laughed and called you nuts. But this was exactly my reaction to the story. And the fact that the sermon doesn't happen in the way we have been craving, but turns, slightly--in an absolutely unexpected but at the same time inevitable way--makes the ending just that much more satisfying, surprising, and redemptive.<br /><br />This is a gorgeous, expansive, timeless, beautiful book.
6305910340|5.0|From the title you might imagine a swarm of detectives combing the city looking for champion Bobby Fischer missing from a chess tournament. However, this is the story of a very gifted young boy named Josh Waitzkin who possesses an intuitive grasp of chess (and other games). Though SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER features chess, it's not about this game so much as it is about nurturing a child to grow into his own person. The mysterious disappearance of Bobby Fischer, world chess champion, did leave a void. But does this give family and coaches the right to demand that another child fill that vacancy? Can Josh continue to enjoy chess along with all the other things \\"normal\\" children do? Or is he destined to become part of a regimented chess-champion making machine?     A poignant point in the movie is made when Josh's coach angrily tells him his behavior is inconsistent with prior champion Bobby Fischer. The prodigy replies, \\"Well, I'm not him.\\" This is a movie an entire family can enjoy together. The PG rating is earned from drug dealers and gamblers depicted in the park where people play chess.    Movie quote: \\"To put a child in a position to care about winning and not to prepare him is wrong.\\"
B000065V3H|5.0|\\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" (1987) was probably made to cash in on the rush of 80s romantic comedies but it succeeds where others fail, mainly because \\"Love\\" has a real message to send out - - be very careful what you wish for; you just may get it and it may not be what you thought you wanted. <br />Patrick Dempsey, pre-Grey's Anatomy, is Ronnie Miller, a nerdy, smart kid who hates being in the unpopular group, who can't sit in the home section at football games and can't sit anywhere near the \\"cool\\" kids in the school cafeteria.  He's been saving up for many summers (cutting grass) to buy a really awesome telescope.  He goes to the mall to get it and instead runs into Cindy Mancini (Amanda Petersen), the girl of his dreams, who is pretty, popular and the head cheerleader.  Although they go to school together and Ronnie cuts her grass, Cindy doesn't even know his name.  Cindy is in a predicament - - she has worn her mom's off-limits suede outfit to an end of summer party and got wine spilled on it.  A replacement is a thousand dollars - - which Ronnie happens to have handy.  He forsakes his telescope, instead \\"paying\\" Cindy a thousand dollars to pretend to be his girlfriend for the first month of school. As imagined, the alleged match is met with skepticism and horror by the \\"in crowd\\" and just plain skepticism by Ronnie's old friends, who he will soon abandon for life in the fast lane of the popular kids.  Cindy makes Ronnie over, to make him look more hip and cool, and she soon begins to see more in Ronnie than originally met her eye.  But their one month contract is up, and Ronnie has come to believe his own popularity.  Will Ronnie fall from grace with the popular kids?  Will he realize that Cindy has fallen for him?  Will they get together? <br />Pretty basic stuff, but \\"Love\\" is such a fun movie because it will really remind you of high school.  The popular kids look down on the \\"nerdy\\" kids, picking on them when bored.  The popular girls that never gave Ronnie a lookwhen he was sitting with the nerds are now falling over each other to date him, once he is \\"seeing\\" Cindy.  Cindy proves to be a pleasant surprise - - she is pretty, blonde and a cheerleader, but she has depth.  She is a secret writer, something she shares only with Ronnie - - and she complains to him that she doesn't \\"do\\" anything but hang out and shop, and she wants to do more, but people don't expect anything else from her.  Touching stuff.   <br />Amanda Petersen is wonderful as Cindy - - you can feel her admiration and affection for Ronnie building, and feel as crushed as she does over Ronnie's transformation into the media monster who believes his own hype.  What ever happened to this appealing actress anyhow? <br />The message the film sends across is perhaps a little schmaltzy towards the end (only filmmakers in Hollywood think that popular kids in school are going to applaud what a perceived nerdy kid says in the cafeteria) but incredibly satisfying.  While feeling that Ronnie deserves the come-uppance that he gets, you also feel sympathy that he was exposed in such a public manner and that he is blacklisted not only by the popular group but also by his former friends.  Patrick Dempsey brings a tenderness and yearning to Ronnie that makes him so appealing, even when he's being full of himself.   <br />Does Ronnie get his girl at the end?  Well, it is a romantic comedy and an 80s movie, so that answer should be fairly clear, but it's a fun journey to get there! <br />A really sweet and endearing film - recommended.
B00000J7SS|5.0|In August of 1970, Miles Davis changed the face of jazz, yet again, in the recording of \\"Bitches Brew\\".  It is an album that receives a lot of attention, both positive and negative-- for some, it's the end of an era of greatness, for others, it's the beginning, and still for others, it's a pale imitation.  But what \\"Bitches' Brew\\" is clearly is a statement by one of the most respected jazz musicians and an album that would change the landscape of jazz forever. <br /> <br />Davis was by 1970 no doubt totally alientating his crowds-- having surrendered the ballads and hard bop pieces that made his reputation first for the new compositions of his second great quintet, Davis further confused and alientated his audience by his use of electric instruments in establishing the soundscape of \\"In a Silent Way\\" the year before.  In the interim, Jimi Hendrix brought distortion and feedback to mas attention and Tony Williams had a jazz group playing rock and roll.  Davis took all of these ideas and, like Hendrix brought distortion to the masses, brought rock music to jazz in a way no one else could do. <br /> <br />For the album, Davis began with his working quintet-- then saxophonist Wayne Shorter (performing exclusively on soprano here), pianist Chick Corea (heard here on electric piano), bassist Dave Holland and added to them guitarist John McLaughlin-- Davis courted McLaughlin endlessly and he's present on virtually all of Davis' early electric albums.  Davis also doubled reeds (Bennie Maupin on bass clarinet), keys (Joe Zawinul, with Larry Young also playing on a couple pieces), bass (Harvey Brooks) and drums (Lenny White), as well as adding percussion to the mix (Don Alias and Jumma Santos).  The result is a dense stew that, contrary to the notion of this being a jazz/rock fusion album, creates a structure that is wholly unique-- there is always something going on, sometimes several things, with the wash of keys and percussion providing a backdrop on which the horns and guitar and emerge from the backdrop to provide lead voices.  For his part, Davis seems unnervingly inspired, either by the sound or the music or the musicians, his playing is superb, exploring his upper register and playing with a passion and energy.  But really it's the group performance that shines-- the band (McLaughlin in particular) find ways to counter, backup, reply and encourage the lead voice or to provide a constant blend and shifting sound base where no one is really the lead. <br /> <br />The music itself seems most similar to the sort of compositions on \\"Kind of Blue\\"-- rough sketches or simple themes serving as springboards for soloing.  Several of the pieces are extended (the first disc consists of two tracks both extending past 20 minutes and three of the second disc's four tracks run past 10 minutes), but the pieces never feel overlong-- instead they feel like extended suites as ideas turn into themes and back into ideas.  Individually, the tracks matter less than the whole, though I've got my favorites (the rabid jam of the sublimely titled \\"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down\\" being the high point for me), but there's no wasted time, no material not worthwhile, it's pretty much fantastic start to finish. <br /> <br />This reissue gives the album the sonic quality it deserves-- anyone who's got the old issue of this (withe purple border) really has no idea what you're missing-- the sound here is fantastic, crisp, clean and fresh, well worth the upgrade, and adds a bonus track from a session at the beginning of 1970 (\\"Feio\\") as well as extensive liner notes excerpted from \\"The Complete Bitches' Brew Sessions\\". <br /> <br />\\"Bitches' Brew\\" is often mentioned among the critical recordings that everyone should own, the best of jazz and whatnot.  These things are all true, but despite it's reputation as a jazz/rock fusion label, the album is a bit less accessible then most people would assume.  While I love this record, it's extended tracks and focus on improvisation can make this a difficult listen for someone unfamiliar with jazz.  Conversely, it's constant ready-to-boil stew can make this equally difficult for someone used to the looseness and economy of sound on a jazz recording.  In the former case, Davis' \\"A Tribute to Jack Johnson\\" would likely make a better intro-- it's a bit extended, but it's essentially an album of blues jams, in the latter, \\"In a Silent Way\\" with it's sometimes minimalist approach may work better.  Regardless though, albums rarely get better than \\"Bitches' Brew\\", and it is something everyone should have.
0375751513|4.0|Of all the fears that creep into a man's heart,the most disturbing is the fear of one's own self. A man may evade the whole world but can't deny his conscience and as William Shakespeare remarks somewhere,\\"Conscience doth make coward of us all\\". One may accomlish painting goodliness on one's visage but would never be able to blend his soul in a similar fashion. The whispers of the soul about one's past sins and misdeeds keep lingering in one's heart.<br /><br />And that's precisely the theme of Oscar Wilde's only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". It is a telling tale about a stunningly handsome,almost beautiful,man's bizzare idiosyncracy of authoring his own tragic doom,about how a youth so splendidly bestowed with beauty,wealth,royalty and women could get sucked in by the myriad forces that he himself gave rise to,about a man's confused,complex frame of mind.<br /><br />Dorian Gray is that ultimate effigy of an ideal youth gifted with all arts and talents. He's the instinctive and eternal source of inspiration,\\"simply a motive in art\\" to his friend,artist Basil Hallward. The backdrop is the gentry and the royalty class of London during the late 19th. century and the Irish writer's genius lies in exploiting this landscape to picture in words and absolutely ethereal imageries man's obscure desires. Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait traced by Basil and in the general flow of the tyde,conceives an unimaginable notion:to remain forever young whilst the portrait may wither! Indeed such a wish lurks deep inside everyone and so does the realisation o its fruitlessness. But for once,at least in fiction,the fantasy is translated into truth,a dark,troublesome truth.<br /><br />Evey novel,and for that matter every incident,requires a certain spark to unfold a series of actions to conglomerate into a rare item called literature. That urge in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is impelled by Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and witty man just ten years older than Dorian,whose eloquent gush of words \\"touched some secret chord\\" in Dorian's heart and sets it \\"vibrating and throbbing to curious impulses\\". The philosophies and crisp remarks by Lord Wotton about life in general and youth in particular push the youth onto his demise.<br /><br />Supernaturally Doian Gray's desire to remain young for good does manufacture itself into a fascinating reality but there's nothing called free lunch under the sun. Commencing from the time when Dorian turns an implicit murderer of his lover Sibyl Vane through the constant denudation of principles and character in the subsequent fourty or so years culminating in him murdering his friend Basil,Dorian stays protected under the shade of evergreen youth whilst his portrait consistently deteriorates and ages---it even turns a mirror of Dorian's own soul with dark contours signifying the crimes committed by him lining its entire figure and in his attempt to relieve himself of the picture,and with it his hideous sins,the eponymous potagonist brings about his own end.<br /><br />The theme of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is singled out to be about how we get disturbed by our own souls but there're other ideas webbed in as well. That the author Oscar Wilde had an inclination towards gay culture is of course a subtle truth and this is ever so slightly pictured in Basil Hallward's unassuming and suspicious admiration of Dorian. The general occurrences in the gentry society and invokation to women's feelings too are colossaly and humourously penned down superadded by a streak of confusing and often conflicting ideas of life that never falter.<br /><br />There was never really a Faust who sold his soul to the Devil but it was actually Goethe's authorical magic that made it seem so. There was never really a Dorian Gray who exchanged peace for youth but it's actually Oscar Wilde's staunch belief that \\"it is the spectator,and not life,that art really mirrors\\" that materialiases into a concrete portrayal of life in fiction.After reading Emile Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer.ring Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer.

B00005JOEA|5.0|Sections: FILM; ISSUES; REACTIONS. <br /> <br />FILM <br /> <br />The film is an acute and welcome departure from the Matrix excesses. The only criticism I have is in the sound production. The multiple plot layers and other aspects emerge through dialogue with sometimes one or two words being of significance. I found it difficult to catch the words in a few spots, and to answer some questions, saw it a second time in IMAX, which was much better overall. <br /> <br />The direction is fine. Editing is quite good, especially during the historical background montage scenes. The pacing of the movie is excellent. At over two hours running time, it never dragged. The unfolding of the story through the police investigation helps too. The photography and direction during some of the Evey/V dialogues are also very good.  <br /> <br />The CGI effects, so ubiquitous in the Matrix films, are kept to a minimum, to good effect. Also, the action scenes, i.e. the blood letting, are a smaller proportion of screen time than would be expected, also to good effect. <br /> <br />The sound track is an excellent complement to the visuals. Very atmospheric as well as dramatic, it supports the momentum of the film. The liberties with Tchaikovsky work well and structurally these scenes bookend the film. <br /> <br />What really makes the story line work is the acting. Beyond the three key characters of V, Evey and the detective Finch, the other parts are relatively leaner and several are short lived. Having an excellent ensemble of actors for these parts is a real treat, especially Robert Allam's Prothero, John Standing's Lilliman and Sinead Cusack's very touching Delia Surridge. John Hurt is very fine and Stephen Rea does an excellent job of keeping the development on track. <br /> <br />Natalie Portman's Evey is solidly good, but not extraordinary in my view. The affected English accent wobbles a bit between parts of England and occasionally crosses borders. Much has been made of her havingher head shaved in the film. It works and her performance during that scene works well, if you keep in mind she was born and raised in Israel. Her physical stature is a bit problematic in being so waif-like, she has no where to go in terms of showing the effects of her imprisonment, but this is a minor point. Just praise has to be given for her scenes with V, as she cannot act off the expressions of the other actor. Lastly, she does a good job of evolving from a more childlike innocent in the beginning of the film, to a much more seasoned character by the end. <br /> <br />Kudos go to Hugo Weaving. It is hard to imagine another actor pulling off this role. It would certainly be a very different V if (say) Sylvester Stallone was in the part. Weaving's voice is one of his strongest tools as he demonstrated as Agent Smith in the Matrix series. The vocal one-dimensionality of that role is dispensed with in V. With material from Shakespeare and uniformly well written dialogue, he has ample opportunity to display his mellifluous range. As he re voiced the scenes after they were shot, he had the opportunity for nuance that might not have been achievable with set microphones. Volumes are spoken sometimes with the fewest words as in one incredibly atmospheric scene (D: \\"Is it meaningless to apologize?\\" V: \\"Never\\") or between Evey and V (E: \\"You knew her?\\" V: \\"Mmmmm\\"). <br /> <br />But the voice is not everything. The body language and mannerisms work tremendously well with the voice. Which brings up the mask. (Terrific costume conception, i.e. hat, wig and cape.) The voice, body language and the mask create a unique character. Eye movement or anything else would have diluted the effect. With only voice and body, you end up looking at the mask and looking for an expression, at times almost seeing one. The shrugged shoulders during the rooftop conducting scene have you imagining a conductor's expression of eyes closed in musical passion. Similarly, when V relates to Evey hismoment of personal breakthrough, the mask seems to come alive. A very interesting aspect of the mask, the other side of it hiding meaning in the dialogue, is that allows for ambiguity. A facial expression often explains a statement, but this makes V the more enigmatic. The mask also makes V iconic and more than human, an idea or ideal. V, in his last scene has the same appearance as always, and we think of him as unchanged. <br /> <br />ISSUES <br /> <br />Freedom fighter or terrorist. Both are clearly in the film. In the TV skit scene, the film makers identify the terrorist. Is V a terrorist? I would say no, although the government continually refers to him as one. He is a revenge seeker, but that is a positive quality in American cinema. My old dog-eared Webster defines terror as a state of intense fear and terrorism as the systematic use of terror especially for coercion. The population in the film, who would appear never to be even scratched (V explicitly states it is the symbol of Parliament that is his target.) seem never to be the least bit frightened and are in fact portrayed as becoming progressively supportive of V. The only people who realize intense fear from V are the government characters. (This might be a more difficult question about the graphic novel, with which I am unfamiliar.) <br /> <br />Pro Liberal/Anti Republican? Don't think so. I never heard mentioned anything about fiscal responsibility, size of government, government sponsored medical benefits, free trade/protectionism, social safety nets, trade deficits, strength of currency, labor, taxation, pro life/choice, but to name a few topics. Is it anti Bush? The name never appeared in the film and little reference is made to America aside from \\"America's war\\" having gone rather poorly. As has been pointed out many places, the source novel on which the film is based was attacking the England of the Thatcher era and the screenplay began before the Matrix series. The film is certainly critical ofcensorship, government control of media, intolerance, lack of political process, kidnapping, torture, popular complacency and authoritarianism. If you feel any of those things are part of the Bush/Republican administration's policies, then it is understandable how you might be offended. (I alwasy thought black bag was a fashion accessory.) <br /> <br />REACTIONS <br /> <br />The trailer for this film as well as it being a Wachowski product probably made most people think it was a continuation on the Matrix trajectory. Frankly, I thought the trailer appeared rather silly. Expecting a couple of hours of action distraction that I felt reasonably confident would not be a complete disappointment since both viewer and critic reviews in Yahoo were B's, why not take a chance? I had not read any reviews so the real tone of the film would be a surprise. And once the V character embarked on his alliterative soliloquy early on, it was pretty clear that I was not going to get what I expected. Some reviewers, particularly those whose saliva is not clear, angrily accused the producers of a bait and switch promotional campaign. Perhaps. Certainly not a marketing sin. <br /> <br />An interesting observation on Yahoo reviews. There is almost no middle ground. Either you loved it (A/A+) as thoughtful and provocative or you loathed it (F) and venomously, I am sure hypertensively and with Cap Locks on (and Spell Checker off), denounced its political disposition as anti Bush/Republican pro liberal propaganda of a bovine nature, being an al Qaeda training film (never made that connection), pro gay, anti Christian/ pro Muslim, and on and on. This apparently was enough to give the grade of F for Direction, Visuals and Acting. Interesting.  <br /> <br />According to the advertisements, the film is rated R for strong violence and some language. In one viewer's comments, he/she was so incensed about the presumed promotion of homosexuality that they implored you \\"DO NOT SEE THIS GAY MOVIE\\". Tooffer proof of the earnestness of their conviction, the reviewer went on to say that because of this, his/her six year old daughter cried for several nights after seeing the movie. Under 17 accompanied by adult caveat aside, now that's concern for family values. <br />

Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again.
B00005JO9J|5.0|While its plot may not be revolutionary, new, or partiuclarly breathtaking, the rich and diverse characters of Grey's Anatomy make the show one of the best.  <br />Even if you've never seen the show before, this is still a worthwhile investment. The characters are deep, loveable, and different. Watching their struggles, which are not necessarily unique to television, makes you feel what the characters feel even as they pull you deeper into the immediate and ongoing plots. The endings of each eppisode are nearly always happy, or atleast bittersweet. You'll never feel like you've wasted your time in watching them. <br />The extras could have been done a bit better. I have to admit, that I was a little dissapointed that there were not more deleted scenes. If I were to rate the extras seperatly, they would only recieve three stars.  <br />Regardless, after watching all nine eppisodes of the first season, I can't wait for season 2 to be realeased!
B0000256KE|5.0|This is one of the great glam albums of the 70's. Bryan Ferry and Mr. Eno and co. created a perfect listening experience that is mysterious, literate, and rocking.. This is right up there with Bowie and T. Rex - but it has its own unique charm that is so different. The lyrics of this album are really good especially in 'In every dream home a heart ache'. And the music is so wonderfully experimental for a rock group (i think this can be credited to Eno). This album is more complete and well-rounded than the groups debut album (another fine album) despite the conflicts that were supposedly taking place between eno and ferry.

B0000VD04M|5.0|Arising from Hollywood Babylon, from the depths of evocative cinematic arcana, here we remember Edward D. Wood Jr., one of the most underrated actors, producers, directors of all time. Driven by an insatiable passion for pictures, he brought his imaginative visions unto the silver screen with all the resources he had available, using wile and guile, remaining the nucleus of his own creations no matter what obstacles beset him. Wood {here portrayed by Johnny Depp} struggles for recognition and gathers around him a cadre of misfits from the crew to the actors themselves:<br /><br />Bela Lugosi: He meets with the legendary Bela Lugosi upon a fortuitous outing near a coffin shoppe, they quickly become friends, and remains Wood's primary star. Herein, he is portrayed as a pathos-inducing, flawed character surrounded in precious memories and the treasures of his career. Wood spends time with him watching Horror films and is regailed with tales of his experience.<br /><br />Vampira {Maila Nurmi; here nicely portrayed by Lisa Marie}: Meets her at a shindig literally begging her to appear in a movie, but is coldly denied. Until later when she is fired from her career as the nocturnal hostess of a horror movie show, finally agreeing to appear in a mute role for \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\". Lugosi actually took quite a liking to her, even remarking on her ample cleavage.<br /><br />Tor Johnson {played by George \\"The Animal\\" Steele}: A brutish wrestler whom many will recognize as a bald zombie character immortalized in Halloween mask form.<br /><br />Lugosi {Martin Landau} became addicted to morphine which plagued him during this time, yet his love of films bade him on until he reaches a point of mandatory recuperation at a detox center, experiencing the horror of withdrawal, and where Wood meets his next wife after knitting Lugosi some black booties to \\"match his cape\\" - it was instant love after that. He eventually confesses his penchant at the local spookhouse for dressing in women's clothing, opting to get that out of the way before progressing with the relationship, and she accepts him nonetheless. His first wife became an ingrate and opted for a so-called \\"normal life\\".<br /><br />Prompted by a brief though motivating chat with Orson Welles, his most memorable accomplishment occurs after this departure, funded, by all things, two Christian ministers whom he convinced would in turn fund several religious films. Wood and crew actually become 'baptized' to ensure this cooperation. One of the most humorous lines in the film consists of his friend 'Bunny Breckinridge' {Bill Murray} who said \\"How do you do it? How do you get all your friends to get baptized just so you can make a monster movie?\\"<br /><br />The black and white format really manages to place one in Noir Hollywood, enhancng the overall storyline in certain classic style.

Then [the vocalist's] tongue slips firmly into his cheek as he adds: And when you put it all together in one good looking, young, 21st Century rock band, you can't fail!\\"<br /><br />This quotes pretty much sums up what's wrong with metalcore. All that matters is which band is new or \\"trendy\\" in the \\"scene,\\" or looks the best. Musical value? What's that? Who cares if the music is mediocre, the lead singer has HIGHLIGHTED BANGS! OMG! ^_^

B00001OH7T|5.0|I can understand how this album might not appeal to certain people, I suppose. That being said, I suppose the best way to put into words how I feel about this album is that it is like a religious experience for me. <br /> <br />I started out listening to Bowie albums like Ziggy Stardust and Diamond Dogs, so I was totally unprepared when I heard this. My father swore by it, and after listening to it myself I wholeheartedly agree with him that this is a completely underappreciated album. <br /> <br />\\"Young Americans\\" is my second favorite song period. Not second favorite Bowie song, just second favorite period. This song alone is almost worth the price of admission, and I would make the case that it is one of the best songs ever written. Maybe I'm going a bit overboard there, but I'm simply in love with the tune. <br /> <br />As for the meat of the album, turn the stereo up, grab a glass of your favorite wine, dim the lights and enjoy. This album simply screams - or croons, rather - smooth. I'm thinking of \\"Can You Hear Me\\" in particular.  <br /> <br />I'd recommend this album to anyone and everyone, but if you're a Bowie fan and you don't already have this within 10 feet of your person while you read this, you should probably be ashamed of yourself.
B00001ZWTT|1.0|WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. they have taken a great tv show, which many of us fondly and raped it. this is so wrong headed i don't know where to start,but here goes. <br />1. why would they make a black man an agent in the 1800's when he couldn't go in many places and would stick out like a sore thumb. because of the race change for jim west this becomes series of crass racial jokes and has no place in a light hearted adventure series. in fact the tv show never stuped to that level,infact it showed that west's greatest villin was the small in size only dr.loveless played by the great michael dunn!he and west were always evenly matched and had great respect for each other,even when loveless was tring to kill him. <br />2.the changeing of loveless's person to a legless southern general,and once again the race card is used to makeloveless less likeable when on the show you really liked him even if he was a mad ,evil man. <br />well you get the idea this is the reason you should leave some things left unmade or in this case unremade. just the pits ,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS, instead by the complete first season of  \\"THE WILD,WILD,WEST in june of 06 and see what the movie should have been.  <br />
B000001EAQ|4.0|I picked up Pop the week it came out. I listened to the album a couple of times, but had really just begun to discover U2 as a band, and therefore balked at the idea of this sounding a bit different than the U2 albums I'd listened to thoroughly at that point: Achtung Baby and Zooropa. <br /> <br />Recently I began listening to the album again, and was surprised to find that I really enjoy it. Now that I've really given the album a close listen, I think it's definitely underrated. \\"Discotheque\\" is okay, and \\"Mofo\\" really stops this from being a 5 star album, in my opinion, but there are quite a few gems here. <br /> <br />\\"The Playboy Mansion,\\" \\"Staring at the Sun\\" and \\"Last Night on Earth\\" are all standouts. This may not be the ideal album for listeners new to U2, but for vets this is definitely a must have.
B000002JS6|5.0|Nobody was expecting AC/DC to recover, let alone record another album after the death of Bon Scott in 1980. As devastating as it was to lose such a dear friend, Angus said to the rest of the band, 'Well, F**K this. I'm not going to sit around moping all f**king year,' and picked up his guitar. Thank God he did. Brother Malcom called up his bro on the phone two days after the funeral and asked Angus, 'Do you want to come back (to the studio) and rehearse?' The rest is music history. They began auditioning new singers and once they heard Brian, it was all done. Bon Scott actually saw Brian perform in 'Geordie' and was very impressed. He mentioned Brian to the rest of the gang, too. <br />Before the recording of their new album in the Bahamas, Mal was getting off the plane and a customs officer grabbed his gutiar.Malcom almost socked him in the face, but the other guys in the band held him back! Mutt Lange was brought back to produce as he had on 'Highway to Hell'.  Malcom later said, \\"Mutt never liked the fact that we raged a bit too much at the end of our songs. He said he'd give the new album a bit of spit and polish. He got the best out of us.\\"  No argument there. <br />Brian Johnson turned out to be amazing, helping create \\"An album about Bon, and for Bon.\\"  <br /> <br />This monster album went #1 in England in 6 days, selling 10,000 copies PER DAY. It hit #4 in the USA in July and was certified Platinum on Oct. 13th, 1980.(to date it has sold 19 Million copies worldwide) At that time, it was unheard of to see such numbers. AC/DC embarked an a grueling 7-month world tour and their actual list of required beverages,etc. to be backstage for all of their gigs included: <br />  <br />4 bottles of the finest Highland-bottled Scotch <br />4 bottles of Jack Daniel's Bourbon Whiskey <br />4 bottles of Blue Nun <br />4 cases of Heineken <br />2 large pizzas - (must be fresh and hot after each show with no f**king anchoivies!) <br />1 Deli-Tray for 42 people (including roadies) <br />NO TURKEY ROLLS!! <br />4 Different kinds of Bread <br />1 jar of Black Currant Nectar <br />3 Dozen Assorted Soft Drinks <br />4 Bottles of Perrier Water <br />2 Quarts of Gatorade <br />2 Quarts of Milk <br />2 Cartons of Benson&Hedges Cigarettes <br />And a pot of hot tea with a jar of honey for Angus. <br /> <br />The critics said more of the same crap-\\"Their lyrics reek with satanic messages and blatant phallic humor,\\" and \\"More songs about humping and booze.\\"  Well, the fans said screw you and came to the sold-out stadiums to worship their gods. Brian summed it up the best,wearing his trademark Tam-O-Shanter, \\"They (the fans) have this intense loyalty. The kids don't want to just come to the show. They want a t-shirt that says,\\"I like AC/DC and I'll fight anyone who says different.\\"  <br /> <br />During that tour, and others to follow, AC/DC used the biggest and loudest sound system in the world.(At the time)and even pissed off Tennis superstar John McEnroe by booking the stadium across the street from his tennis match with Bjorn Borg on the same night! <br /> <br />According to a very recent musician's review from Amazon.com;  <br />\\"Most rock bands at that time used slick production techniques to mask their shortcomings in the studio which resulted in a 'dated' sound. Back in Black didn't have any tricks and sounds just as powerful today as it did then. How did they do that?\\"  AC/DC's mission was simple and to the point: <br />A loud, uncompromising assault of \\"pure masculinity.\\"  As this true fan worded it so brilliantly, \\"A Man's Album, with a man's basic deires: women, booze, and heavy-metal.\\"  <br /> <br />I wanted to rate this album with 8 stars but the Amazon.com scale only goes up to 5 (Five being extraordinary). <br /> <br />History will remember 'Back In Black' as a milestone in music from the 20th Century.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001H00|5.0|Milstein's playing of these incredible pieces is overflowing with a patrician elegance balanced by his own style of almost \\"fiddling.\\" The Stradivarius he utilizes is a happy balance between the resonant power of today's modern instruments with the warm, natural sound highly prized in Baroque violins.<br /><br />His tempi are never too fast or too slow, and he has a magnificent sense of pacing throughout the great Chaconne. Because of his background in performance, Milstein's technique blends classical aristocracy with the soulful bends and vibrato of the Gypsy fiddle style. The result is a recording of the Six Sonatas and Partitas that captures them in all their technical accuracy, while reaching a depth of humanity rarely seen in other recordings. Milstein's 'Six' form an organic whole, not just a collection of pieces that happen to be placed together on a disc (unfortunately, many modern recordings of the solos feel exactly that way).<br /><br />Milstein's unique intonation gives his interpretation a highly earthy and personal quality. Not to be missed.

B000ETRCMQ|3.0|If I were not transsexual, I would probably have loved this movie. It's a wonderful story, well-told and well-acted. Unfortunately, the makers don't understand the subject. <br /> <br />Their conception of transsexuality is rooted in the false idea of \\"a man who wants to be a woman.\\" What is hard to communicate is that a transsexual woman has never been a man. We are born with female brains. All of our lives, our consciousness and emotions are those of a woman. We don't know what it is to be men, because we have never experienced the world as men. <br /> <br />We do know what it is like to pretend to be men, to try to fit in as men, to be treated as though we were men. But we never were. <br /> <br />Everything about the character of Bree screams out \\"man in a dress.\\" Her clothing is a false stereotype of how we dress. Lots of pink, lots of over-the-top touches like the pink hat. I don't know a single transsexual woman who dresses like that. We dress like any other woman. We like blue jeans and comfortable clothes like any other woman. <br /> <br />Her mannerisms are the same. When she camps out with her son, she plays it like a stereotyped woman in a bad 1950's comedy. Again, I don't know a single TS woman who acts like that. I certainly don't act like that. <br /> <br />So if you want a film that shows what it's really like to be transsexual, this isn't the one. But if you want pure escapist entertainment, a fascinating tale of a growing relationship between parent and child, this film is an excellent choice.
0743424425|5.0|That quote from the book may not make scence now but it will after reading this book.  This book is one of the more mind bending and also scary things ive seen or read.  Most of the horror is held within the feeling of isolation.  <br />                                               Jack, Wendy, and their son Danny  move from thier ( Jacks ) past in Stovington.  Luckily Jack gets a job from his friend Al to be the caretaker for The Overlook hotel   from the months of October through April, By Himself, with only danny and Wendy for company.  There is a catch that only the ones who \\"Shine\\" can see.  The Overlook has some very dark secrets (REDRUM). <br />                                     This book surprised me on the way that it gave me nightmares.  Just the thought and visions makes me wake up in a cold sweat.  I will close in the words of Hallorann the cook at the Overlook-  \\"Promise me Danny you will stay out of room 217.\\" <br />

B0002S94OS|4.0|Fans of true metal can rest assured that bands like Lamb of God are still laying down the law, with no hint whatsoever of grunge, rap, or emo. Lamb of God have the potential to both move metal forward while also staying true to the classic death and thrash of the 80s. This album gets pretty interesting as it goes along, with unexpected song structures that bring out the fearsome chops of the musicians. The true hero of the band is the relentless and airtight drummer Chris Adler, who especially shines in \\"Blood of the Scribe\\" and \\"One Gun.\\" Guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler also really stretch out on those two songs, plus other winners like \\"The Faded Line,\\" \\"Omerta,\\" and \\"What I've Become.\\" However, even though these two guys have real power riffs, like most modern metal guitarists they seem to have lost the art of the solo. This is a bit embarrassing because the two best solos on this album are actually from 80s thrash heroes Alex Skolnick and Chris Poland, who are guests on the instrumental title track.<br /><br />The music of Lamb of God is true to the standards of real metal, but they also have the weak point shared by just about every metal band we have these days &#8211; the vocals. I have nothing against Lamb of God singer Randy Blythe, and in fact he has a fair amount of flexibility, and even subtlety in a few places. But he pretty much refuses to get out of the standard metal screaming and growling \\"cookie monster\\" mode (a tragic corruption of Phil Anselmo that a billion singers are doing), and this holds back Lamb of God's forward momentum. The politics of this album's lyrics are also a bit muddled and unfocused, though they are certainly forceful. If Lamb of God weren't so worried about fitting into their category, they could easily make that category stronger. [~doomsdayer520~]
B000E1YVZU|4.0|My first RENT experience occurred on Broadway.  There was so much hype surrounding the play at the time that a let down (considering my expectations) was, perhaps, inevitable.  Still, I liked many of the musical numbers and that prompted me to buy the soundtrack.  And that is where I fully appreciated what Jonathan Larson had created.    Flash forward several years later and I still listened to the original Broadway soundtrack when I heard that a RENT movie was finally going to happen.  I thought the trailer was great, giving you a real sense of what was at the heart of the movie: love and friendship.  I love the movie.  It was great of Chris Columbus to utilize so many of the original Broadway cast members.  The musical numbers, I thought, were crisper and tighter: edgier, if you will, than on the stage.  I actually find myself preferring many of the film's song versions than the Broadway versions.  I do prefer the original Mimi's voice, Daphne Rubin-Vega, but Rosario Dawson is still great.  Whoduthunk?  Chris Columbus' use of flashbacks to show the Roger-April relationship was a nice touch and it was sad (in a good way) to see Angel slowly slip away to AIDS - something you didn't get in the stage version.  It's a long movie, but so is the play.  With the magic of DVD it's great that we still get to see some original numbers such as \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Goodbye Love\\" which were cut from the movie.  I still think \\"Goodbye Love\\" should have been included in the film's final cut.  The documentary on Jonathan Larson was really great, thorough and informative.  It's wonderful to see how his parents carried the torch for him after his untimely passing. And the director's commentary with Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal was fun (who'd have thought that Taye Diggs performance during the funeral scene was so bad it had to be cut?).  Gripes?  Not many.  I wish the trailers would have been included in the extras.  Also, it would have been fun to hear from more of the cast in the commentary.  During the commentary, Chris Columbus also mentioned several scenes that were filmed, including, for example, April's suicide scene.  If they were going to be cut from the movie, they should have at least shown up as deleted scenes.  It also would have been nice to include the video diaries that were on-line during the making of the movie on the DVD as Peter Jackson is doing for KING KONG.  At the end of the day, RENT, the movie, is a great final tribute to the play that shook Broadway to its core. And I am anxiously awaiting the chance to see the play again.
B000024D4R|5.0|So, you've decided to look for another Floyd album, eh?  If you're like the majority of the music-buying public who owns any Pink Floyd albums, you probably already have the popular Big Three - \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"The Wall\\" - and now you've come to a major intersection with different paths to head on down.  None of the routes are bad choices, but they all have very different landscapes - and besides, you can always come back and try another direction!      If you're looking for something more like Dark Side at this point in your journey, I would recommend you try the criminally underrated \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" (Wot's...Uh The Deal may be the best radio-friendly Floyd song you've never heard).  If you're looking for something completely different (besides Arthur Frampton), try the Anglo-psychedelic tour de force \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\\"  Or, if you're looking to take extended excursions along musical landscapes with lyrics that bite into your walk like pine needles on soft soles, the legendary, one-of-a-kind prog-Floydian Animals should be your next step.    Pigs on the Wing Parts One and Two sandwich the three meaty songs within - Dogs, Pigs and Sheep.  There are plenty of other reviews that analyze Roger Waters' Orwellian meanings in the songs, so I'm not going to do that here.   I will briefly discuss one aspect of the music, though.    Once the Syd Barrett era ended, Roger Waters became a major contributor to Pink Floyd.  As time went on, he steered the band's direction more and more.  By the time they put out \\"The Final Cut\\", the band had basically become a Waters solo vehicle with David Gilmour being allowed a few flourishes here and there.  \\"Animals\\" was the last album where Rick Wright's keyboards played a prominent role in the music.      Many fans love talking about the sharpness of Waters' lyrics or the soaring solos of Gilmour, but I think it's Wright's keyboards that provide the texture holding it all together.  Dogs simply would not have worked without Wright's undertones to Gilmour's solo from 5:32-6:46, or the atmospheric sounds from 8:00-12:15, or his playing anywhere else in the song, for that matter.  His gentle arpeggios balance out the opening bassline in Pigs perfectly and provide a background to the entire song that would seem empty without.  This can be demonstrated in the space left by his keyboards dropping out at 6:10 for the quick break while Gilmour and Waters oink and slide, before Nick Mason kicks it back in a couple of seconds later, that only makes Wright's presence that much more noticeable.  There are too many instances of his playing to go on, but you get the point.     As I said earlier, \\"Animals\\" is one-of-a-kind in the Pink Floyd discography.  Other albums will have a track or two that are extended magnum opuses (opi?) like \\"Meddle\\" or \\"Atom Heart Mother\\", but \\"Animals\\" is the only one that has all of its songs in a non-radio-friendly length.      Regardless of the duration, though, \\"Animals\\" is one of those albums that, the more you play, the better it gets.
B000E97HIA|4.0|I have been waiting for a Prince CD, like 3121, since \\"Diamonds And Pearls\\". I read the first sentence of someone else's review and could not agree more: \\"You never know what you are getting when you are opening a new Prince CD.\\"  SO TRUE!!!<br /><br />I have had many disappointments over the years when hearing a new Prince CD...Either too jazzy or just too off the wall to be able to  get in to. Not the case here. This CD is GOOD!<br /><br />I heard \\"Black Sweat\\" and it brought me back to the likes of \\"Controversy\\", \\"I Would Die 4 U\\", \\"1999\\".....It has that classic and vinatage Prince sound to it. I LOVE it. I was hoping the CD would lean to that style as well. It pretty much does and I could no be happier.<br /><br />Prince takes his old, trademark sound and blends it with the vibe of today and that makes 3121 what it is. A funky jam fest with a few ballads thrown in. I am not too into \\"Te Amo Corazon\\" - I just find it to be bland & boring. The first song on the CD and the title track \\"3121\\" is alright. The sounds on that song get a little annoying after a few spins. Besisded those 2 songs the rest are GREAT! It's on heavy rotaion on my iPod already. A few of the songs remind me SO MUCH of \\"Soft & Wet\\" which takes me WAY back...love it! He busts out the vocoder and is back to his loud shouts and screams.<br /><br />My Top 4:<br /><br />\\"Love\\"<br /><br />\\"Black Sweat\\"<br /><br />\\"The Word\\"<br /><br />\\"Incense And Candles\\"<br /><br />A Must have!!!!
B000BYCAJE|5.0|This is still one of my all-time favourite albums in this genre...CSN (and sometimes Y) have produced a vast body of work over the years, some of it good, some great and some better off left in the vault.  I especially enjoy hearing outtakes and demos, the four chosen here are superb, albeit the tip of the iceberg.  It would be so nice if they did a really extensive archival box set as there are dozens of cool things lurking in limbo....time will tell, but don't hesitate to pick this up if you are a fan of this stuff.
B000ENWKN8|3.0|I think the other reviewer is right about this having slower songs than usual.  Most of the songs are pretty good but not as interesting or spooky as anything from hellbilly delux or astro creep.  This CD is like a mix of Manson's the golden age of grotesque, Alice Cooper's Brutal Planet, the tunes from house of 1000 corpses, and Zombie's the sinister urge - so in other words nothing original here.  Also Rob Zombie's toned down image is rather dull and unimpressive.  His lack of brutality in his lyrics also makes this somewhat of a duller effort when compared to his past.  Buy it if you are a fan of white zombie or rob zombie or metal but don't expect this to be his best.  The best songs on here are Death of it all, Ride, Lords of Salem, American Witch, and Let it all bleed out (being my favorite).  I give this CD a 7 out of 10.
0307276902|4.0|I actually enjoyed the book, had it been an actual account of James Frey's personal experiences.  After the recent disclosures in the press and the media that Mr Frey might not have been totally honest in publishing his \\"memoir\\", I read the book with a little bit of cynicism.  It was well-written, and could be used to describe addiction, on many levels, in many different subjects.  However, I could not get over the fact that Mr Frey had not been entirely truthful in his recollections of his past. Therefore, I recommend to anyone who reads the book, that he or she should read it as a novel \\"inspired by true events\\", rather than, \\"based on true events.\\"
0553381407|5.0|I have read a number of books on this subject, and found this one to be excellent in identifying with the children and adult-children of toxic parents.<br /><br />It didn't get into the labeling of the different types of behavior disorders that a parent might possess, (i.e. Narcissistic, Borderline, Anti- Social), but instead focused on the hurtful behaviors, and gave sound advise on how to recognize, understand and remedy these problems. So many of the other books on this subject get into identifying the names of the various types of behavior disorders, as well as the labeling of the dysfunctional behaviors of splitting, projecting, etc...  All very important to understanding toxic parents, but it was refreshing not to get a review of these facts for the umpteenth time...  As a result of this style of writing, I was able to get more engaged in the topic at hand, toxic parents.<br /><br />I also found the book to be more intraspective, not only with the children and adult-children of toxic parents, and how they were affected by their parents, but with the adult-child as an adult, and how he or she may be repeating or avoiding the sins of their parents.<br /><br />I found the book to be written so well that I'm beginning to read a second book by the author, Susan Forward, Emotional Blackmail.
0066620996|4.0|I was inspired, for awhile. Actually, many valuable concepts remain with me to this day. One concept: If your company is doing too much narrow your focus to what you are passionate about and it will drive you to great success... Simple. Caveat: Eventually after reading you may become frustrated in an endless cycle of good with great out of reach when you realize your \\"Stop doing list\\" doesn't really work since your \\"To do list\\" continues to grow. Perhaps Good to Great can work if a company really embraces the principles and puts them into action, at least the research shows this to be the case.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|All things are said about this wonderful and haunting film. I made me stay up all night after the first view and I had to see it again the next day. I funny and logic to see the reviews spreading in utter two sides: totally not or totally perfect. Well, I logic in a sence it presents two kinds of people: the ones who feel and have a heart, the ones who do not. Simply!~<br /><br />For the ones who feel, who felt pain and suffering, who is in touch with her/his feelings, go see this film. It will change your life.
0141301104|4.0|This book was a book about trying to kill the witches! The narrator (his name is not stated in the book) is about 7 years old at the time and his parents died, so he lived with his grandmother. His grandmother was an expert when it came to witches. She told him that witches are bald (so they wear wigs), their tongue is blue, they have no toes, they have a keen sense of smell, and they have no fingernails (so they wear gloves). His grandmother also tells him about the Grand High Witch, which is the ruler of all the witches. Every year, they have a meeting. Witches hate children, so they use many different methods to kill them. Summer comes and the narrator's grandmother decides to take him to Hotel Magnificent.(They were supposed to go to Norway, but his grandmother is too sick to go so faraway.) Before they leave, he is given two mice he names the girl, Mary, and the boy, William. He is caught bringing the mice and the manager doesn't allow mice, so, he has to keep them in the cage. One day, he sneaks to a meeting room and hides there to play with his mice. That's where the witches' meeting was. The narrator is caught and is turned into a mouse with their new medicine the \\"Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker\\". Then, his grandmother finds out and they take the \\"Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker\\" and put it in all the witches' soup. At the end, the witches are all gone and the narrator and his grandmother live happily ever after. <br />I liked this book because I thought it was very creative! Like in this part it says: \\"'Don't interrupt, \\" she said. \\"Just take it all in. The second thing to remember is that a REAL WITCH is always bald.'\\" Also, this book is a very fun book. Just like in this part: \\"No witch would be stupid enough to leave anything suspicious lying around for the hotel maid to see.\\" <br />I didn't like the book because I thought it was a bit disgusting. Just like the ingredients for the Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker. It says: \\"Tventy-vun hours of boiling, \\" answered The Grand High Witch. \\"And while this is going on, you take exactly forty-five brrrown mice and you chop off their tails vith a carving-knife and you fry the tails in hair-oil until they are nice and crrrisp.\\" <br />My favorite part of the book is the ending because it's happy and everyone can relax at the end.
B000002GQL|5.0|There are good reasons why this album went all the way to #1 on the Billboard album chart in 1972...The reissue of \\"Night In White Satin\\" as a hit single at the same time Seventh Sojourn was zipping up the charts, two strong singles from this album both penned by bassist John Lodge (\\"Isn't Life Strange\\" and \\"I'm Just a Singer\\"), one of flautist Ray Thomas' best songs written for the Moodies in \\"For My Lady\\", lead guitarist Justin Hayward's bittersweet \\"New Horizons\\", plus his incredible talents abounding on all tracks.<br /><br />The last of the classic \\"Core 7\\" albums from one of the most admired bands of all time, Seventh Sojourn was the final touch on an incredible 5 year run for the Moodies.  Their overall sound since this era has never been duplicated without Mike Pinder's unique mellotron embellishing their music. This album is a wonderful testament to the Moody Blues, and the glorious sound and power of their music during this time.  It still sounds like music that could have been recorded yesterday, and Seventh Sojourn will go down in Moodies history as ONE OF THEIR BEST...EVER.<br /><br />Now how about nominating The Moody Blues for induction into The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame???  LONG OVERDUE!!!
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I am a huge Mariah Carey fan! I fell in love with her when I was in the 3rd grade and first heard \\"Always Be My Baby\\"...now I am a freshman in College and still love her! <br /> <br />This album is easily her best album!! It is filled with great dance tracks, beautiful ballads and great hip-hop beats. Lets do the run-down: <br /> <br />1. It's Like That(7/10)-Very fun song! Not that great of a 1st single for the album, but its still really good.  <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together(9/10)-Everyone knows this song! Very simple but kute lyrics! Her most successful single of her amazing 16year career!! <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off(10/10)-This is one of my favorite songs from the album! I LOVE it!!! It's a great kiss-off to any guy that has ever done any girl wrong! Makes you just wanna sit back and bounce along! LUVS IT! <br /> <br />4. Mine Again(8/10)-This is a great ballad! S0o0o0 pretty! Awesome song, just not a personal fave! <br /> <br />5. Say Somethin'(6.5/10)-I don't really like this song. It's kinda boring. I don't care too much for it... <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night(10/10)-Another fave of mine! I love this song! It's beautiful!! I think this has a possibility as being the final single from this album. <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number(8/10)-This is a really fun song. It features Jermaine Dupri. It's really kute and fun to dance to. I like it! <br /> <br />8. One and Only(10/10)-This, I think, is probably my favorite song from this album! The lyrics are just so awesome! I can relate so much! \\"Everytime I turn around I found my heart in pieces on the ground!\\". I just love it!!! Features Twista. <br /> <br />9. Circles(9/10)-This is another fave of mine! I love it! Great lyrics. <br /> <br />10. Your Girl(7/10)-This song is so kool! I really like it! Kute and simple lyrics! <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew(7/10)-This is like a live track, like she's in concert. It's pretty good! I like the lyrics! Very vulnerable! <br /> <br />12. To The Floor(7/10)-This is an alright song. Features Nelly. Hot beat by the Neptunes. <br /> <br />13. Joyride(10/10)-This is also my fave song from the album. The lyrics are just so beautiful. Even with the title, it actually has nothing to do with riding. LOL. It's about being in love and how she feels like shes on a joyride. I love it!!!!! <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird(7/10)-Very great lyrics. Gospel is not my style though! <br /> <br />15. Don't Forget About Us(8/10)-Not a big fan of this song...but its good! <br /> <br />16. Making It Last All Night(What It Do?)(8/10)-I really like this song! It's awesome! Very fun to dance and groove to! Features Jermaine Dupri again. <br /> <br />17. So Lonely(One and Only Part 2)(8.5/10)-Really great song. Track produced by Darkchild. Its awesome, just not as good as \\"One and Only\\". <br /> <br />18. We Belong Together(Remix)(7/10)-Just a remix! It's good though!
B000021YQV|4.0|While System of a Down's debut album was a decent effort, this pretty much blows it away. \\"Toxicity\\" is a terrific follow-up, one of the best albums of the 21st century. These guys are definitely different than most bands out there today, and they're also one of the best. There is a lot of great stuff on offer here, such as \\"Chop Suey!\\", \\"Needles\\", and my personal favorite, \\"Aerials\\". There are not too many low-points, \\"Jet-Pilot\\" is pretty annoying but that's about it. SOAD are one of the best numetal bands out there right now, trying their best to keep the genre alive. If you're gonna get one System of a Down CD, make it this one. They've yet to match this awesome album and they probably never will.
B000002AVF|5.0|This woman sure can create great music!! Best songs: <br /> <br />1. Forever(10/10)-Has become one of my fave Mariah songs! LOVE IT! <br /> <br />2. Meltaway(10/10)-Another fave!! It's gorgeous!! <br /> <br />3. One Sweet Day(9/10)-This song has a new meaning to me now since I lost my Grandmother! I love this song!! <br /> <br />4. Underneath The Stars(9/10)-Antoher great song! I love it! :-) <br /> <br />Other standouts include \\"Fantasy\\" and \\"Looking In\\"
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Growing up with the previous Batman films I had grown a fondness to them, especially Tim Burton's first two. Heading in to see this new take on the series I expected another typical film, better than Forever and Robin, but not Batman and Returns. I was amazed and entertained more than I have been before from this type of genre and I have only seen a few films which are as close to perfect as this one. From the design to the acting this film is great for anyone, even if you aren't interested in comic book films. This double disk dvd makes the experience even greater, with an interactive comic book menu and in-depth special features. It makes me clammy waiting for the next film in the trilogy due out in 2008.
B000002BQK|4.0|This is one of Mariah's best albums! She put out some really good music! The best songs are:    1. Breakdown(10000000/10)-This I think is my favorite Mariah Carey song EVER!!!! the lyrics are just AMAZING!! She writes songs like no other person on this planet! I love this song with a passion!    2. Butterfly(8/10)-Typical Mariah song about love that you once had. Very kute lyrics.    3. My All(10/10)-I love this song so much! Her voice! Her lyrics! She's just amazing!!    4. Honey(7/10)-This song is okay. Not that great, but it's good.    Another good one is \\"The Beautiful One's\\" with Dru Hill and \\"Fourth Of July\\"!
B000E97Y6K|2.0|I felt that King Kong did not live up to Peter Jackson's previous works, Creatures, Frighteners, LOTR, and was at times filled with too long of V Rex fight scenes as well as death and looking scenes. The pacing was slow after the first hour and it became less interesting until the end of the film. Although the energy of the first hour was building it up, it failed to deliver what was promised from the strength of the opening of the film. It would be a good film to sit at home with on a rainy day when you have a lot of free time that you don't know what to do with, but it is very different than what he has done before.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|No, it's not like Hellbilly Deluxe or Sinister Urge. It's a little slower, but still good. If he made something that sounded just like his other solo efforts everyone would be bashing him for not doing something different. I think making a copy of Hellbilly Deluxe or Sinister Urge would be the safer way to go. You can't win with everyone. People get older, mature, and change. It happens.  <br />I, for one, like the album.
078324228X|5.0|I watched this with total absorption at the plight of this unusual man, the Hurricane.  His story, as others outlined in reviews here, is very sad and unjust:  accused of a crime he didn't commit by a racist cop with an odd hatred of him, he is thrown in prison at the height of his career.<br /><br />I thought that Denzel Washington was absolutely brilliant, bringing an entire environment and life story with him in each scene as only great actors can do.  He is perhaps the greatest actor in America today.  This performance is one of his best - you sense his internal struggle to survive, with little of it stated directly.  And he grows throughout the film, from a battered youth into a hyper-disciplined athlete, and then as an inmate seeking deeper meaning in life.  It is truly amazing how well he pulls this off.<br /><br />Then there is the youth who contacts him, a boy from a similar background who is given a chance by a remarkable and unorthodox household.  For some reason, the Hurricane responds to him after ignoring many others, and these two - as well as his foster parents - embark on their own journey of discovery.  As the youth matures, he learns about the political system and feels empowered to change things. That is a profoundly healthy of the American political system.  Eventually, they do change things, which is also a big step of trust and engagement for the Hurricane.  It is really beautiful and uplifting, deeply moving as I identified with both characters.<br /><br />I now want to learn about the protagonists, perhaps in biographies.  The story goes to the heart of an America in transition, when I grew up.  I do not know enough to answer the critiques about his character by other reviewers.<br /><br />While I think that more details should have been included in the film, the drama is taut and well told in my view.  It is a completely successful film experience and I am sure I will introduce this to my children when they are ready to learn about race in America.  FOrtunately, the racial tensions are infinitely less acute than when I grew up, so much of this will be historical for them.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.t race in America.

B000002MTR|4.0|I have been a Peppers fan a large portion of my life, however it has only been about 2 years since i've been completey taken back by this band. Already owning Californication and By The Way, i was intrigued to buy past albums and completely loved BSSM, Mother's Milk, Uplift Mo Fo, Freaky Stley. But i had hesitation to buy this album only because it has been reviewed horrbly over the years and said to be the worst album of the Peppers.  <br />This album is not better than Californication or BSSM but it is equal to By the Way. Dave Navarro brings to this album, a very rythmic and powerful guitar, a bit more melodic than that of Frusiante. Navarro, has never recieved credit from RHCP fans, only because they are so narrow minded about John Frusiante. Frusiante is one of the best but give Navarro his credit here.  <br />Without a doubt the best song on this One Hot Minute is \\"My Friends\\", which is definately in the top 5 songs ever made by the chili peppers, but this is very well known song that most fans have already heard numerous times. The track \\"Walkabout\\" is a very jazz oriented beat which really shows off the skill of Navarro. \\"Aeroplane\\" has a classic Flea bassline to it, which is great. Anthony Kedis's ode to Kurt Cobain \\"Tearjerker\\" is a very harminous and mellow track, with some of anthony's better vocals for that time. \\"Transending\\" is a strong track as well.  <br />There are a few tracks that i haven't cared to listen to very often, there is a track entilted \\"Pea\\" which i dont care for, there is no other way to put it than plain stupid. \\"Deep Kick\\" and \\"One Hot Minute\\" usually are skipped in my cd player, these tracks sound like forced tracks just to meat deadlines during recording. This album will not blow you out of the water like Blood Sugar or Californication but it is a must for the collection of every RHCP fan.
B0001IN07Q|1.0|Love Michael Buble, but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience.  Parts of Michael's head was cut off, and then; sometimes, his whole head was cut off.  Most of the time, the camera man didn't expect where Michael was going to move to and you'll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get Michael back into the picture.  I wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert.  That this was just home made videos.  This was definitely not worth $20.  If you want a professional quality concert, I would recommend buying Michael Buble's Caught in the Act.  Caught in the Act was worth the $20 bucks.  You get professional camera men who anticipated Michael's movements, and parts of his head was never cut off like Come Fly with Me's DVD.  Also, the sound quality on Caught in the Act was way better.  Now, I understand why some places sold Come Fly with Me DVD's and had the word enhanced after it.  The DVD that I received was not enhanced.  Anyways, skip this one, and get \\"Caught in the Act\\" instead.
B00000J7SS|5.0|I've owned this recording in various formats since 1976.  Is it my favorite Miles Davis release?  That depends on what day it is.  Contrary to the three-star show-case reviewer's pontifications and pronouncements, this was a VERY revolutionary record and it makes for great listening.  First of all, this was one of the first commercially released sessions that featured performances that were \\"sculpted\\" into a composition.  That's right, the performances were recorded and then, through the use of looped tracks and scissors and sticky-tape, many of the pieces were created.  THAT was VERY revolutionary for 1969.  So, anyone claiming this isn't revolutionary is a musical M-o-r-o-n and doesn't know anything about how this release was created.<br /><br />This musical work was to jazz what Stravinsky's Le Sacre Du Printemps (Rite of Spring) was to orchestral music.  Revolutionary.  This work evoked some very strong reactions both for and against it. Similarly, fist-fights broke out in the audience at the Parisian premier of Le Sacre Du Printemps.  And speaking of Stravinksy, Maupin's bass clarinet actually reminds one of the bass clarinet heard in Le Sacre Du Printemps.  It is used in much the same way. A constant, mysterious sound surrounded by a cacauphony of instruments declaring their version of the truth.<br /><br />The lengthy \\"jams\\" are not out of place or overly indulgent  that reviewers comment was pretty lame considering that the lengthy pieces are precisely the point of Bitches Brew.  I will write that I find it very interesting that Miles once said of Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet playing: \\"It sounds like someone is standing on Eric's foot.\\"  Yet, here Miles has Bennie Maupin playing bass clarinet and sounding very much like Eric Dolphy throughout this session.<br /><br />Miles brought electricity and a new kind of power to the world of jazz.  I love this recording, all of it from Pharoah's Dance to Sanctuary (the original closer).  The remaster is superb, the drums have far more clarity than previous editions.  Kind of Blue still has its place and this belongs right along side that landmark work.<br /><br />I like the way Brian Eno describes these sessions. I'm paraphrasing here but essentially he says itt's as if Miles is in a panoramic landscape.  Over on a hill over there we find John McLaughlin, in that valley over there we find Bennie Maupin, on a hill over there is Chick Corea and so on.  Miles is in the middle of this vast landscape, directing the musicians as needed.<br /><br />I won't say much about the other pieces as there is just so much to say that I don't know where to begin.  I will mention a particularly beautiful passage on Spanish Key that Miles plays at about the 13 minute mark that is extraordinary.  It is a few lines full of heartache and tenderness that come out in what is otherwise a tune with a very cool, driving beat. It's strange but simply incredible and so very beautiful.<br /><br />You need this landmark session in your collection and if you have the previous Columbia Masters series, dump it and buy this 24 bit remaster! You'll hear all sorts of little subtle sounds, especially from Airto, that you just can't hear in the previous Masters release.ity than previous editions.

B000BVQ9JO|2.0|Ok, so I've only listened to this album once and because it's The Strokes I'll listen to it again and again because I want to like it. It kind of reminds me of when I heard The Cure's \\"The Top\\" for the first time...I couldn't believe the boys actually thought that album was worth producing at all. I loved \\"Is This It\\" immediately. Not so with \\"Room on Fire\\" but it grew on me. This one, well we will see. I will give it another shot after I have recovered from the shock.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is the most intense love story I have seen in a long time!!! I can't wait for it to come on video to add to my dvd library...It's a one of a kind movie that made me realize love is so real or so powerful...It also made me very sad that there are closed minded people out there who disapprove of gay love and mocked the movie or put it down. If everyone opened thier minds and hearts and had compassion for their fellow man, maybe this world would be a better place to live!!
B00005QIPH|5.0|How could anyone dislike The Strokes? Being voted one of the worst live band performers in 2005 and recieving many critics' batterings has probably contributed to their unpopularity but honestly, as far as the general public is concerned, have many people ever honestly listened to and taken in this band? I love this album...every song is colourful and exhuberent! Sure, there are the Blink 182's of this world but, to me, they relay a common sound. The Strokes offer more...a raw, sharp innocence that just grabs you by the throat and says \\"Hey, wake up\\"!. Go on and listen to this album. Don't be put off by critisisms if you havent heard it already because you could very well be missing out on something that will uplift you.
0060977264|5.0|I read this book a while ago after reading another of Paulo Coelho's book, The Alchemist. I recently bought this book for a friend because I remember just how great this book was and how easily we could relate to the character's struggle. From what I can recall, this book continues on with the character trying to find his destiny and along the way, having to decide what can truly make him happy and yet knowing that there will be sacrifice involved.
6305291446|4.0|There have been a lot of 'Halloween' films, and no doubt there will be many more.  But only three of them carry the spirit of the original, and only three tell the core story of the saga.    'Halloween,' the classic original.    'Halloween II,' picking up right where the first leaves off and setting the stage for . . .      'Halloween H2O,' echoing the first two, and bringing the original story arc to a close.    All the other films are purely exploitative.  Films three through six wander all over the place and are completely gratuitous in terms of violence, gore and illogic.  Number eight should never have been made, undoing all that H2O accomplished, much as 'Alien III' so severely undermined James Cameron's 'Aliens.'    I, II and H2O.  Stop right there.  Do not pass GO, do not collect $200 -- and enjoy a classic horror/suspense trilogy as John Carpenter intended, made in the tradition of Hitchcock.
068987474X|1.0|Ok, so I have a brother and a large number of male friends who come to me for advice on women. I can tell you this much: if never pays to generalize- you will make a lot of harmful assumptions. Generalization gives us all sorts of negative things, such as sexism and racism, and even marketing for that matter. The best we can ever do is use common sense, and get advice from people who respect us and who know a particular situation. Sure you can read a book that tells you  \\"Don't get tricked into asking him out. If he likes you, he'll do the asking.\\" and pretend that there is no shy guy out there who is intimidated by your looks and intelligence and doesn't think he can get a girl like you. You could lose good opportunities that way. Also, think of the endless paranoia that reading a plethora of \\"he's not interested\\" situations can bring. <br /> <br />In short, save yourself some money. Use common sense instead.
B000B8QF14|3.0|Having seen Green Day live twice, I can agree with many of the other reviewers when they ask if there is a better live band touring  today than Green Day.  I, along with them, can assure that there is not.  The concert recorded in this set was at The National Bowl Milton Keyes in England.  The set list mainly consists of the bands most popular songs, which is hard to digest for me personally.  The concert that we have here is absolutely fantastic, but as my title suggests, Bullet In A Bible could have been far better. <br />     My complaints are that of the concert.  The concert was edited in it's length, meaning that there are songs missing from the set list, which is probably the worst thing about this set.  The DVD is great visually, and musically.  Green Day is a real visual band.  You have to see them play live.  The flow of the concert is interupted by documentary footage placed in between each song.  The footage is pretty cool, and shows many emotions of the band and what it is like going on tour. <br />     Considering that this is Green Day's first full-length live CD (they have several live EP's such as Foot In Mouth, Bowling, Bowling, Parking, Parking, and Tune In Tokyo. . .), there is room for improvement.  What I would suggest is to not edit the concert's length, and to have documentary footage on the  DVD be listed as a extra feature.  This CD/DVD combo is a great example of Green Day performing live.  I do recommend this for all Green Day fans.  Do yourselves a favor!  The next time Green Day comes to your local venue, buy tickets!  They put on a fantastic show, and you can have this at anytime. <br />
0670451495|3.0|Sorry but I fail to see what is so great about this book. I didn't like for one thing the mother duck's arrogant attitude that she's such an expert mother and her proudly parading her brood down the street oblivious to the trouble she is causing the drivers and the endangerment to her ducklings. Not a good example for children either is her intial attempt to cross a busy street. If the policeman hadn't been there she'd have been road kill. I think it would have been better if the ducks had been characterized as dumb animals instead of one's with arrogant thought processes.      And I didn't understand why they returned to the place where they could hardly get food except by begging peanuts and where they nearly got run over by a little boy on a bike. And why did father duck take off? A strange book, so I plan to read it a few more times to see if I can get something else out of it.     The old-timey illustrations are detailed and interesting. Thus the three stars.
068987474X|5.0|This book changed my life. When I read it, I was trying to get over my ex who I loved, but unfortunately, he didn't feel the same. I honestly didn't know how I was going to get over him. Or find a man that wasn't a jerk or one that wouldn't vanish off to that island of lost men I'd heard so much about. He's Just Not That Into You changed all that for me and gave me the closure I needed for my break-up with that last ex as well as closure for the hurt I'd endured from guys I'd been dating who would disappear. After reading this book, I realized I deserved better. And I realized I only wanted a man who only wanted me, for my good points as well as my not-so-good ones. It gave me the courage to be single and to live my life on my terms. The advice in this book is right on the money. Not long after I put my new \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" mentality to the test, I met my wonderful boyfriend who is solid proof of what Greg & Liz speak of in this book. He made the effort to call me and send me emails, and despite having a very demanding job (yeah, we've all heard that excuse) he made the time to see me. This book opened my eyes to the things men do when they are really truly into you. And if you really think about it, why chase after some guy who doesn't think you're great? That's what this book is all about. I've loaned this book to many of my girl friends who have thanked me profusely and even asked to pass it around to other friends of theirs. Don't settle...we all deserve better, and it is far worse to settle into a relationship that doesn't suit you than it is to be alone.
B000069AT7|3.0|ET was that film that moved many of us.  I was and still am a fan.  I was looking forward to the DVD release when I found out that the movie had been recut for DVD.  Spielberg has cut the single disk set so that the film is sensitive to today, not that there was anything wrong with it.  One can see the original version on televison all the time.  The only place that one can get the original is in this box set.  The low rating is do to that fact that the original version is not readily available to the public.  I have no trouble with extended edits or directors' cuts but Hollywood should be reminded that people fall in love with films. Give us what we want and remember. Don't get me started on G. Lucas.
B000E6ESL2|3.0|STAY is the epitome of the old clich \\"all style and no substance.\\" There is a lot of serious camera trickery, wild editing, nifty camera movies and the like. It's also got lots of moments that are clearly meant to be creepy, or at least heavy with foreshadowing...you just don't know what's being foreshadowed. Directed by Marc Forster, who did both MONSTER'S BALL and FINDING NEVERLAND, STAY misses the mark when it comes to a STORY we can truly care about. Forster has proven himself to be a fine director. He also has probably done nearly as well as he could with this film...I suspect it's a movie that should not have been made in the first place.  <br /> <br />STAY is nominally in the same ilk as SIXTH SENSE, THE RING, etc. Heck, it even features a psychiatrist working with a disturbed youth. Lots of portentious things happen throughout, so you certainly get the sense that something weird is going on, and that you've got a puzzle to sort out. I guess it's fun to try to put the pieces together before the movie does it for you. Thinking back on it, I think it MIGHT be possible to figure out where the movie is going to twist in the end...but there are an awful lot of red herrings on the way too.  <br /> <br />The film starts as the story of a psychiatrist (EWAN MACGREGOR) who is assigned the case of a young man (RYAN GOSLING) who has stopped his car in the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge and set fire to it, and now is threatening to commit suicide by midnight on Saturday...just three days away. The shrink believes the kid means it, but somehow he can't manage to get him committed, and can't even really keep track of him. Gosling shows up on his time, not MacGregors, and they play a cat and mouse game, where MacGregor pries a few \\"facts\\" from Gosling, who then darts away. Things get stranger when Bob Hoskins appears as MacGregor's mentor (and he also happens to be blind), because Gosling sees him and declares that this man is his dead father come back to life.  <br /> <br/>So, as MacGregor digs deeper, he begins to experience strange things himself...perhaps even carrying on conversations with ghosts. His artist girlfriend (an underused Naomi Watts) tries to offer support, but she becomes a bit obsessed with the idea of meeting and helping this kid herself, as she has in the past attempted suicide herself.  <br /> <br />Things become more and more confusing as we approach the time of the suicide. And then all is revealed. The \\"twist\\" ending is rather mundane and has been done numerous times before. I won't spoil it by hinting at what it is, but my impression was that I had just spend 90 minutes waiting for a pretty disappointing climax.  <br /> <br />The movie never really makes us care very much for anyone in it. MacGregor's character mostly comes across as a bit of a wimp (who can apparently cast aside all his other patients at the drop of a hat) and a terrible problem solver. Watts is a moping cipher. Janeanne Garafalo makes a brief appearance, and her character is one-note as well. Gosling has the most to work with, but his character changes moods for no apparent reason, so it's difficult to work up much sympathy. The whole puzzle of the film is academic...we don't invest emotion into it.  <br /> <br />Then there are the pants. MacGregor's character wears high-waters throughout the film, for NO good reason. If you watch the ending VERY carefully, you'll know why his character dresses this way, but it is NOT worth it for the filmmakers to have thrown this in the mix. Every time we see Ewan, we see his short pants and it is HUGELY distracting. \\"WHY???\\" you ask yourself over and over. \\"It makes no sense and it looks really stupid besides,\\" you answer yourself.  <br /> <br />So, in summation, the film has a lot of style and cool trickery. It lacks a heart, and unfortunately, the climax lacks real surprise or impact. The final scenes do manage to develop just a bit of sadness...the first real emotion we feel. I can't recommend the movie to anyone, but I can see that some people might like it more than me, depending on how intrigued they are by the idea of figuring out the \\"puzzle\\" of the film. It is rated \\"R\\" for some strong language, but otherwise the film is pretty mild, and could easily have been PG-13...perhaps this would have helped the opening weekend box-office, cuz this film is going nowhere fast, based on its initial box office take.  <br />
B00005JOUM|4.0|MOVIE: Spike Lee has never been on my top list of directors. His movies usually have very strong social commentaries, and nothing more than that. Those social commentaries though are usually the same thing, and it always has to deal with race. Hell, he calls every one of his films \\"A Spike Lee Joint\\". I'm not against it, but it usually detracts from the story. Inside Man is really his first movie that really focuses on the narrative and is intent on telling an entertaining story. The film is his most mainstream film to date, and in my opinion is his best. Clive Owen plays a bank robber who decides to go Dog Day Afternoon style and perform an elaborate bank heist, but this theif has everything planned to perfection. The film opens right into the action and wastes no time. Denzel Washington plays the \\"average joe\\" hostage negotiator who is assigned to the case, and Chiwetel Ejiofor plays his partner. As the story progresses we learn more of what the true purpose of this bank heist is. The owner of the bank, played by Christopher Plummer, has a secret about his past that could destroy his repuation if released to the public and it happens to be located in an unlisted safety deposit box in that bank. He hires Jodie Foster to help him try and reason with Clive Owen's character, while all Denzel Washington is concerned about is serving justice. The film is quick, superbly edited, and extremely entertaining. Spike Lee doesn't compromise his techniques and the film still retains all of the familiar Lee social commentaries. Race and politics become the underlaying theme for the film and it moves it in the right direction. All the reviews and ads talk about the twist ending and a plot full of surprises. It's not that kind of movie, there isn't a Shyamalan twist waiting at the end of the movie, but there are a few secrets about the characters that are slowly revealed throughout. There are some surprises that will make you grin with shame becaue you didn't see them coming, and those are always fun. The racial and political theme is not overpowering, it's not what drives the film but rather enhances the character relations in the film. It's a really well put together piece of filmmaking. Sharp dialogue, light tone, and great entertainment make Inside Man a joint worth passing to the next person.<br /><br />ACTING: This is the dream cast that any director would kill for. Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, and Willem Dafoe headline this impressive ensamble. I mean, how can you have bad acting with a cast like this? It's impossible. The cast is so experienced that they make it look easy to pull off roles like these. The characters feel natural and real, and are emotionally involving. It's a great cast.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Spike Lee proves himself to be a great storyteller. He focuses on the important things and highlights them with his personal touches. He even has his trademark \\"floaty camera\\" technique, which he uses to show determination on Denzel Washington's character's part. Even the opening titles and credits are done with style. He uses a very catchy song for the opening and closing credits that sets the perfect tone for the film. It's a song from Bollywood composer, A.R. Rahman. It's titled \\"Chayya Chayya\\". You can find the album on Amazon, it's the soundtrack to Dil Se. Inside Man is a tightly woven piece of filmmaking, and is worth your timethose are always fun.

B000002LEE|4.0|Well I'd say in 1988 this was fairly shocking anyway, and 3 years before \\"Nevermind\\", which makes me wonder who really started that alternative craze. Alot of people really fell under the spell of Jane's Addiction, because they were such a wonderful mesh of art, funk, metal, and punk. Other bands incorporated these same things, but something about Perry's voice, Dave's riffs, and Stephen's drumming really stood out. I also love the fact that they could drop the heaviest song like \\"Had A Dad\\", and then the most beautiful one like \\"Summertime Rolls\\". They excelled at both. Plus, how amazing is the opener \\"Up The Beach\\", which needs volume by the way. Overall I hesitate to say this is better than \\"Ritual De Lo Habitual\\", but it's almost there, and the album cover made for a sweet poster on my wall for many years.
0140042520|5.0|This book was great!!! Being that I am from Washington state, this book was a real easy read, not only that, the descriptions of the pacific northwest were well written.  After I finished this book, I proceeded to take a trip up to Mt. Rainier and spent three days hiking, camping and just enjoying all that this nature and the world has to offer. Do yourself a favor, if you feel bogged down by the stresses of modern fast paced life...pick up this book and just get away for a while. <br /> <br />
B00005NWRS|3.0|Other than the complete \\"Love Is Hell\\" album which I find very consistent, this is your typical Ryan Adams album. Meaning half these songs ARE gold, and of course the others are just so-so. His first real hit \\"New York, New York\\" is here, and that's a great start to the album. I find the rest like \\"Firecracker\\", \\"Gonna Make You Love Me\\", and \\"Nobody Girl\\" to be good, and others like the last few should have simply been dropped. My overall favorite track is \\"When The Stars Go Blue\\", which is a primo Adams song if there ever was one (also covered by The Corrs and Bono). The bonus disc is a nice extra for the big fan, and I enjoy it, but not so essential to buy this twice for. In short a must for the fanatic, but I like \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Cold Roses\\" better.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing! I love films, I want to write screenplays, and I have gotten much influence from David Lynch. When I first saw this movie, I didn't quite get it, however, I was soooo fascinated, intrigued, mezmerized, you name it!! Second time I saw this, I think I got it. HOWEVER, I feel like my \\"theory\\" on this film is not the only \\"right\\" one, this is what leads me to my title on this review. I don't think anyone will know exactly how this movie makes sense except for David Lynch, and I also feel that Lynch also wrote this film so the viewer could think of numerous theories on how this movie makes sense. Anyone see where I'm getting at? Anyway, I think the people who don't like this movie are people who just don't wanna think, this movie, in my opinion, is outstanding for that! You can talk about it for hours with someone who has also seen this movie, and come up with so many different angles for this movie. I LOVE IT! CAN'T GET ENOUGH!
B000BEZQ18|5.0|The movie soundtrack is a well-packaged CD mixing Gustavo Santaolalla's deserved Oscar-winning score with some great country pop songs.  Best soundtrack from a non-musical picture in a long time.
B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater's 'Scenes From a Memory' was released in 1999. This is DT's first (and the only one so far) concept album and their debut with keyboardist Jordan Rudess.    This is definitely a masterpiece in any sense of the word but I gotta say something out of the way. Some people already said that but I feel I need to say this. When I first listened to Images & Words I was instantly blown away by songs like Metropolis, Pull Me Under, Another Day, Learning to Live and Under a Glass Moon (especially UAGM), the I picked up this, Awake, Falling Into Infinity and Train of Thought and from these albums, SFAM was my least favorite and I didn't get why people are obsessed with this. But after all this has drastically changed, now this is my 2nd fave album by them next to I&W and FII is my least favorite. So don't expect to be blown away at the first time, it really pulls on you with time. Think at it like wine, it gets just better when it remains in your library.    The story (from what I understand) is about some guy called Nicholas who has nightmares and goes to a psychotherapist who throws him back in the year 1928 to where there's a girl called Victoria who he falls in love with and she is getting murdered by his brother. It's basically part 2 of 'Miracle and the Sleeper' from I&W. It's one of the better stories you can find on a concept album. In fact I think the idea of making a rock album and throwing in a story is generally stupid, there's only one story on a CD I really like (on Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime, which has a less good musicianship, but for a change that album has hooked me on the first listen, so if you're inerested get also that album), but here the story is really cool notheless. Musically it also rocks, Petrucci really delivers here and proves he is one of the best guitarists ever, rigt up there with Van Halen, Satriani, Page, Friedman etc. In fact I don't have a favorite guitarist, but I, a guitarist with average skill can tell you it's someof the most difficult stuff to play. Labrie's voice is perfect for this album, Mike Portnoy's drums will blow you away, as the same with bassist Myung. Although I think Kevin Moore was better, Rudess has here some [...] keyboard solos. 'Regression' is one of the strongest DT album openers, Overture is a nice instrumental, 'Fatal Tragedy' is great also and it couldn't close off any better than with 'Finally Free'. 'Dance of Eternity' is one of the best instrumentals I've ever heard. 'Beyond this Life' is perhaps the heaviest song on the album. But the best song on the album is by far 'Home'. It is one f**king song, enough to blow the whole 'Wall' album outta the water. It starts with a nice soft intro, then it becomes heavier with a wah-wah effect, and some middle-eastern-like riff. The keyboard solo is awesome, Petrucci's solo is one of the best ever made, it worths alone the price of the album. I'll say there's one poor track here, which is 'Through Her Eyes', which is a softer song but it's being killed by the cheesy moaning in the beginning, but make no mistake - the rest is awesome. Oh yeah, don't listen to all the nay-sayers who say this is mindlessly self-indulgent. True, there are some passages that the band mainly made them to show off their abilities, but you just have to 'The Spirit Carries On' and tell me it isn't emotional, even to 'Home', 'Finally Free' or any ballad on the album. The rest nay-sayers are just mallcore retards like MTV rocks or Avrillavigne#1fan, it will just be pointless to explain how pathetic these mentally challenged low-lives are.    There you have it. A must-have masterpiece, recommended to anyone who likes good music in general. If you're like that jack@$$ MTV rocks who thinks that Good Charlotte and Limp Bizkit rock the world and Avril Lavigne is the best guitarist ever avoid at all costs. It may not blow you away at the first time but it will certainly grows on you.    LONG LIVE DREAM THEATER!!
B000E6ESL2|5.0|\\"Stay\\" came and went from theatres around Halloween 05. Seems like the studio didn't know how to market this film and it suffered at the box office. I was fortunate to have seen this movie in the theatres and have been haunted by it since. Now that its out on DVD, I hope it finds the audience it deserves. Buy or Rent it -- just see it. Pay attention to every detail, every word spoken. Watch the backgrounds, the sets, the characters. Its dripping with symbolism but at the same time everything is spelled out right in front of you. Some say this movie is nothing but a trick. Its not -- the answers are right in front of you from the first frame (hint, hint). The reason that \\"Stay\\" may not have found it audience is because ostensibly, it appears to be horror film or ghost story and it may be at times. I think that ultimately \\"Stay\\" is a tragedy. After seeing the film all the way through, you realize that this is a simple, sad story of a troubled young man.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|I'm giving Peter Jackson, Naomi Watts and the incredible special effects four stars.  They've really done something special here.<br /><br />Enough has been written here about the great things in KING KONG but I'll just add that I didn't care for Jack Black in the role of Carl Denham.  His desperation would've been more dramatic (and believable) with a more expierenced, older actor.<br /><br />And I thought Adrien Brody was so physically different from Black that it was distracting: I kept waiting for them to go into a \\"Who's on First?\\" routine.  Brody's hangdog expressions and his transformation from gawky New York playwright into Indiana Jones weren't believable either.<br /><br />Naomi Watts was great, hands-down.  She always delivers.<br /><br />(Now if today's Hollywood can give a brand new story the kind of innovation and energy that Jackson gives to KONG, maybe we'll have something new to cheer about.  Anymore, the only movies I get excited about have been done before, some several times).
B000E33VWW|5.0|First and foremost, this film is anchored by the brilliant performance of Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I know many others have said the same thing, but this performance MUST get an Oscar nomination. It seems highly unlikely that there will be a better lead performance this year. This is a riveting, intelligent movie...but would be completely sunk without a great performance. Truman Capote was an odd man...and his mannerisms and voice would have been easy to turn into caricature...Hoffman makes him as real and believable as such a person could be.  <br /> <br />The movie surrounds the creation of the non-fiction novel IN COLD BLOOD, about a brutal murder of a family in a small farming community. For 1959, it was particularly brutal (although while watching the film, I couldn't help thinking that if the same happened today, it might not even make the national news), and Capote initially sets out to write an article about the effects of the killings on the community. But he's first drawn in by the crimes and a fascination with the brutality. (He even peeks in on the closed caskets to discover that the faces of the victims have been swaddled in cotton because they were so badly damaged by the shotgun blasts.) He wins the reluctant trust of the head law enforcement official (Chris Cooper) and the story begins to take shape. But when the perpetrators are caught, and Capote attends the perp walk, he is instantly drawn to one suspect, Perry King. He finagles a meeting with King and discovers a soft-spoken, highly intelligent soul, in some ways a kindred spirit. Capote is also gay, and the film hints that there might have been a physical attraction to Perry, but it never asserts this as a primary motivator...which is good, because there is no real historical evidence for this, and it would have cheapened this highly textured and layered movie.  <br /> <br />Capote is a man torn apart by conflicting feelings. He misses his lover back home (well-played by a gently aging Bruce Greenwood) but he begins to feel at home in the small town. His manner of dressing even begins to tone down for the \\"local folk.\\" He is horrified by the crime, but drawn to King. He also senses that he has the makings of a groundbreaking book. King and his partner are quickly tried and sentenced to death...before Capote can get all he needs from King. So he arranges high-priced legal help for the men, just to draw out the process. Naturally, King is grateful for the friendship. But is Capote really a friend? Or is he just a selfish man? The movie has it both ways...which is its strength. At no time does it settle for easy answers or clichd feelings. Hoffman is compelled again and again to depict a man who doesn't clearly know his own heart...or doesn't want to face it. He runs for months at a time, but is pulled in again and again. Hoffman handles these challenges brilliantly. Frankly, I doubt there is another film actor working right now capable of executing this role. I can't even imagine who else the director might have had in mind for the part.  <br /> <br />Another key role (an another Oscar nomination, one can hope) is the character of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD author Harper Lee, played by Catherine Keener, one of the best actresses around. At first, she is simply his lifelong friend and now his \\"research assistant.\\" They travel to the crime scene together and she helps Truman seem a little more normal. But halfway through the film, her book is published, and she becomes the most celebrated writer in America. Capote is torn apart by jealousy. It's an unattractive side to him, and there is a brief but lovely scene when Lee recognizes how torn up Capote is, and instead of confronting her old friend (and believe me, she isn't one to necessarily spare his feelings), she offers a brief moment of comfort. Her understanding allows us to know just deeply Capote has gone off his tracks at this point.  <br /> <br />Towards the end of the film, all the appeals run out for the two condemned men, and there are some death row and execution scenes that are downright chilling. We don't feel bad that the men are sentenced to die, but the quietness of the scenes is very effective. Yes, executions make almost naturally compelling drama, but the filmmakers have gone above and beyond. These are not glossy scenes (a la THE GREEN MILE or DEAD MAN WALKING); they are dusty, grim and heart pounding. The young actor Clifton Collins Jr, who plays Perry, does a terrific job throughout, but he shines in these scenes. Never over the top, we nonetheless get a sense of the terror and resignation he is feeling. And we can get a pretty good idea of why Capote's career descended into booze and ineffectuality after these events.  <br /> <br />The movie is not flawless. Although it's less than two hours, the pace is just a little slack and indulgent, and the movie feels just a little bit too long. While the movie does a terrific job in art direction (it feels beautifully of the late `50s and early `60s), the cinematography seemed a bit obvious at times. The same establishing show of New York City was used over and over...I assume some of this was budget limitations, but it's a flaw nonetheless. But these are minor flaws. What the film DOES have going for it is a terrific script, a compelling story, and a fistful of textured, highly intelligent performances. I highly recommend this film...one of the best of 2005.  <br />
078322947X|4.0|Sure, _Sorcerer_ isn't really on a par with _The Wages of Fear_, but it's not the outright failure that everyone claims it to be. In fact, it's one of my favorite movies, a film I can watch again and again and not tire of. There are many great sequences and once the men get in the trucks and start driving, the film is mesmerizing. The extended scenes of both trucks crossing the rope bridge in a driving rainstorm are awe-inspiring and the sequence where they blow up a tree trunk blocking the road is highly ingenious. I wish the picture quality was better, but there probably wasn't much incentive to try to find a better print. I'd also rather see the film in a widescreen format and I'd love to see a DVD packed with more extras than the brief actors' bios and trailer we get. _Sorcerer_ is one of most underrated films I know of and deserves more attention than it gets. Clouzot's original is one of the all-time great motion pictures, but this remake is anything but a failure. Give it a chance!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is definately one of the best albums produced in the last decade.  Norah is wonderful -- her voice hits deep into the soul.  This is passionate music, here.  I highly recommend this album!
B0000C8AV2|5.0|Ok, let me start by saying that by the standards od Dylan fans, I'm a young kid.  He had released 21 albums by the time I was born in 1977.  My father began listening to BD when he was kid.  I hit my teenage years in the early 90's.  As a typical teenage boy, I was very angst ridden and &#34;down on life&#34; in general.  I was very into a little-known band called Nirvana, and was there for their popularity expolsion, and Kurt Cobains eventual self destruction.  To say I was a negative person would be an understatement.  One day I came home to the haunting sounds of &#34;Man in the long black coat&#34; playing on my Dad's stereo.  This positive little ditty would be my introduction to Bob Dylan.  I was riveted.  The next day after school I listened to the whole album 3 times over before My parents came home from work (because who could admit their Dads music was any good?).  Songs like &#34;where teardrops fall&#34;,&#34;Ring them bells&#34;,&#34;Most of the time&#34;,&#34;What good am I?&#34;,&#34;Disease of conciet&#34; and of course my personal opus &#34;man in the long black coat&#34; absolutly grabbed hold of me and fueled my angst.  Needles to say I stole this CD from my Father and carryed it everywhere I went (in the pocket of my [no joke] long black trench coat...) and played it for anyone that would listen.  This album of course opened me to the whole world of Bob Dylan.  Albums like &#34;Desire&#34; followed soon after (another favorite)&#34;another cup of coffee&#34;, &#34;Sara&#34;,&#34;Oh Sister&#34;,&#34;Joey&#34;... All happy and I loved them all.  I started digging deeper into the Bob Dylan Lexicon and found &#34;The lonsome Death of Hattie Caroll&#34;, &#34;hollis Brown&#34;,&#34;Ballad of A Thin Man&#34;,&#34;Like A rolling Stone (still an all time fav.),&#34;Blind Willie McTell&#34;,&#34;I Pity the Poor Immigrant&#34;,  and on and on.    Of Course I'm now 29, Married with kids, I left the angst about our world behind a long time ago, but I'll never let Dylan go.  I own 35 of his releases betwen CD and Vinyl.  The soundtrack to &#34;No Direction Home&#34; is a new Must-have.  But through all of his music I own, I'll never put down Oh Mercy (though I don't carry it around anymore)  And Yes, I did replace my fathers copy I took...
0375704027|4.0|_Norwegian Wood_ is not \\"typical\\" Murakami--no weird sub-plots, mysterious aniamls etc.  It is nonetheless a good example of the bildungsroman genre and an interesting portrayal of student life in Japan in 1968-1970, not all that different it turns out, from student life anywhere at that time period.  The segment set at the sanatorium, while important to the plot, goes on a bit too long.  The Tokyo-based scenes with Toru and Midori being more interesting and better developed.  The ending, somewhat eliptical, is more typical of Murakami's work as are the many western cultural references, descriptions of food and its preparation and the sexual adventures of the main character.  An interesting read.

B000E6ESL2|4.0|STAY  is a strange bird of a movie, one that you must be rested and in the mood for to watch, and one that asks that you forget the usual linear storyline and stay alert every minute.  Directed by Marc Forster (Monster Ball, Finding Neverland, and the upcoming The Kite Runner) and based on a story and screenplay by David Benioff (Troy, The 25th Hour, and the upcoming The Kite Runner!), STAY is more a mind-bending visual excursion that explores some dark psychological questions dealing with life, death, suicide, occult, and a m&eacute;lange of all of these.<br /><br />The opening of the film is a twisted visual experience that has to do with a car crashing on a bridge, fire, and a body - all given during the opening credits.  We then meet psychiatrist Dr. Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor) as he encounters a college student patient Henry Lethem (Ryan Gosling) whom he is seeing for his colleague, the emotionally exhausted Dr. Beth Levy (Janeane Garofalo).  Hesitant to work with a 'substitute psychiatrist' Henry eventually tells Sam he is planning to commit suicide that Saturday at midnight, a re-enactment of his painter idol's absurd life.  Sam's artist girlfriend Lila (Naomi Watts) was herself a suicide attempt rescued by Sam and offers her help in dealing with Sam's patient.  Sam also gleans advice from his mentor, the blind Dr Patterson (Bob Hoskins) and after numerous attempts to contact his associate Beth for information, Sam strikes out on his own in an attempt to understand Henry before he destroys himself.  He looks up Henry's mother (Kate Burton) whom Henry says is dead, discovers when Henry meets Dr Patterson that Henry claims Patterson is his father and is also dead. Ultimately Sam engages the services of a mental institution run by Dr Ren (BD Wong) and gains the promise that the institution will put a hold on Henry so that he will be unable to commit suicide.<br /><br />In the midst of this race Sam's world begins to crumble, people don't make sense, stories clash, and Sam tumbles around in a state closely resembling madness until the final frames when the entire situation of the film is made clear.  Nothing is as it appears when dealing with the thread that separates life and death.  The script is clumsy, the camera work is distractingly of kilter, little gimmicks are used to the extreme, and the tiny roles of supporting characters hardly merit the gifted actors such as Hoskins, Burton, and Garofalo.  Ryan Gosling is again tossed into a role that is starchy and unidimensional and despite his fine work his character remains aloof.  McGregor and Watts do the best they can with the script but end up becoming tropes wandering in from other similar stories.<br /><br />So why give the film 4 stars?  Because despite all the defects it does engage the mind and forces the viewer to set aside the general principles of understanding and just release the mind to a crazy ride. That is healthy film making and deserves attention.

0743454537|5.0|This book was the best book i have ever read. It was one of those stories you just can't put down while you are reading. Throughout the whole book it made me think what I would do if I was in Anna's position.I think the author does an incredible job on telling this story from all the characters perspectives. She also put some amazing medical facts all throughout the story and I learned alot about Lukemia just by reading this book. The only thing i don't understand is why there were never any chapters by Kate. Be ready to have a kleenex box on hand when  you reach the ending.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|DT is my favorite band of all time.  Ever since \\"Pull me under\\", I buy every album (and all the previous ones).  They are so good musically, in fact, that they actually overcome their carnival keyboard sounds and LaBrie's 80's hairband sound (and mind you, I have to defend DT to my friends because of that).  In this album, they don't have to.  They nixed the fruity keyboards and LaBrie is really matured in his sound.  This is their best yet.  Pull me under!
B000E8NRR6|5.0|If you do not have DVD audio player with 5 channels speakers, <br />just buy CD. But If you have this system, just buy this CD with <br />DVD audio disk: Fagen's vocal in center, backing vocals and horns are in surrounding speakers. So much better than CD.  <br />Only recommend if you have DVD audio with  multi channels set up.

B000E8QVWY|2.0|If your interest in this film is an Oscar performance from Witherspoon, you will be disappointed. Accomplishing a credible southern accent is far from qualifying for an Oscar performance. By contrast, Phoenix delivers his usual good acting that gets lost in a pretty mediocre film.
B00005JO20|1.0|i'm one of the few people out there who just couldnt find the time to catch this blockbuster on the big screen. the masses loved it. i felt a little cheated at the time. but now, on the day of it's release on dvd, i've finally sat down and watched this retched, sh*t fest of a motion picture. and let's be fair, it was no fault of the cast. they did the absolute best they could with the script and over-cgi'd scenes. you also can't fault quality actors such as these for trying thier hand at the blockbuster (i.e. leo dicapprio in titanic). let's hope that they stay with the better scripts we're all used to seeing these solid actors in. yes.<br /><br />  now, here's peter jackson applying his \\"lord of the rings\\" touch to this depression era/big city meets bigger jungle tale. the only problem is that we all expected unfathomable outlandishness in l.o.t.r.'s. that's what it was.<br /><br />but the writing involved here was SO far past unbelievable it was distracting. i laughed alot. seriously. it was that dumb. insultingly stupid. can you say naomi watt's character would've had her neck and/or back snapped in just the first time she was thrust through time and space in the fist of kong? please? think how many of us poor working class people could've retired on this movie's budget alone. what a waste. worse yet is the fact i'm mostly alone in my opinion of this made-for-the-unconscious-masses crowd pleaser. good luck.
B000062YAZ|4.0|Back when Metallica was playing in little bars with Dave Mustaine on lead, Slayer was building cred in San Francisco just as the underground hardcore metal scene was sprouting wings. Slayer's press photos back then had them wearing runny, heavy black eye makeup that made them look like drag queens stumbling home at 5 am after a 'long night'...  <br /> <br />They came up north, some people told them to lose the makeup cuz' it made people.. err.. question their sexual preference. anyway, they lost the makeup, hit the studio, and after a couple EPs and a debut LP, out popped this Masterpiece. Slayer could produce very intense and powerful arrangements quite effortlessy, and this album was their official coronation. It basically announced to other musicians that whatever band you're in and whatever you play, you'll never be as fast, you'll never be as heavy, and you'll never be as angry as us. <br /> <br />There isn't one person I've ever met who listened to the hard stuff back in the eighties who does not love this album. When I say hard stuff, i'm not referring to Poison, Whitesnake or the Scorpions. <br /> <br />To my ears, Slayer's only weakness was their lead guitars. They could write and arrange heavy and fast rhythms that put everyone else to shame, but they couldn't play a lead to save their lives. Perhaps it's a testament to Slayer's sound that they always hit on all cyllanders when hammering out the meat of a song. There just wasn't much room for virtuosity and that hyper-fast falsetto lead guitar wailing out of key over a beautiful yet brutal rhythmic anthem always made me wince.  <br /> <br />It's just as well. If Slayer ever did have great virtuoso melodic leads over that intense burning assault of power chords, they would have been absolutely perfect. And no one would be able to listen to them without soiling their shorts and weaping at the same time. <br />
B000750OEA|5.0|From the first note to the last, this album says it all!!!  Here are 33 reasons why Kylie is the worldwide lord of dance and queen of pop!!!    Encompassing her SAW/PWL/Hit Factory days (\\"I Should Be So Lucky\\", \\"Got To Be Certain\\") and DeConstruction era (\\"Breathe,\\" \\"Put Yourself In My Place\\"), not a beat is skipped!  Although MASSIVELY successful overseas, Kylie showcases a wealth of talent throughout this collection that the US has underestimated and underappreciated.  Furthermore, her covers of American trademark singles \\"The Loco-Motion,\\" \\"Give Me Just A Little More Time,\\" \\"Celebration\\" and Tears On My Pillow\\" are more proof of Kylie's stunning voice and incredible talent!  This compilation perfectly serves as an encyclopedic volume of Kylie's career.  As a bonus, this set is a non-stop DJ stash.    Although all tracks are phenomenal, highlights include \\"Got To Be Certain,\\" \\"Hand On Your Heart,\\" \\"Wouldn't Change A Thing,\\" \\"Confide In Me,\\" \\"On A Night Like This\\" and \\"I Believe In You\\"
B000E6UK5K|4.0|<br />A recent Q magazine interview found David Gilmour rallying against all those who insist on calling him Dave (\\"You can't find a Pink Floyd record, going back to 1968, where I've used the name Dave. I love the name David. I hate the name Dave.\\"), fan fixations with exiled Pink Floyd frontman Syd Barrett (\\"I feel sorry for poor old Syd. People's obsession with him is a little unhealthy.\\") and those hoping for a Pink Floyd tour (\\"I don't think Pink Floyd will tour again. With me, anyway.\\"). With any reconvergence of Pink Floyd cast aside for the near future, fans of the old curmudgeon will have to console themselves with Gilmour's first solo album in two decades, with On An Island being a satisfying yet inoffensive addition to a back catalogue that includes only three records away from Pink Floyd's towering legacy. <br />Reading like a Sergeant Pepper's line-up of guests, the musicians assisting David on On An Island include Squeeze's Jools Holland, The Byrds' David Crosby, Roxy Music's Phil Manzanera ,The Hollies' Graham Nash, King Crimson's Robert Wyatt and even Pink Floyd keyboardist Rick Wright adding backing vocals.  <br />Even without Wright's minimal additions, there's plenty of Pink Floyd reference material here for trainspotter fans. In a nod to the similarly titled track from final Floyd album The Division Bell, Gilmour lyrically notes on The Blue that he's `still marooned', while the watery references and throwbacks continue on Take A Breath, where Gilmour's breathy vocals announces that `when you drown there's nothing else' in a further allusion to the drowning lyrics of Animals tune Dogs. Take A Breath has a stoic resonance that feels more aligned with Roger Waters' masterwork The Wall, yet its variety (church bells, acoustic strums and the hum of helicopter blades) makes it a doom-laden highlight of On An Island. <br />If a comparison to another contemporary artist must be made, perhaps fellow Live 8 highlight Paul McCartney is Gilmour's closest musical affiliate. Like McCartney's 2005 album Chaos And Creation In The Backyard, tracks such as On An Island's Smile and Where We Start strip back the pretension and production and instead highlight lyrics that wearily fight against the ravages of old age. He might still be a bit of a cranky sod, but by exposing his fears rather than simply twiddling his way through endless guitar solos Gilmour has ensured that On An Island is a meritorious outing in its own right. Nice one Dave.
B000065U1N|5.0|for all of you people that are complaining that theyre arent enough minorities in this book you need to understand something.  if u read the book black hawk down by mark Bowden u would see that in truth theyre were really only 2 minorities in Somalia for the US.  so its the truth dont complain about it
B000002UJQ|5.0|I have listened to thousands of albums in my lifetime and own thousands of albums and bootlegs. This is the most complete, complex, wonderful album ever.
B00007LTIB|4.0|YES made this record right on the heels of the first exit of Rick Wakeman from the group, and had just replaced him with keyboards player PAtrick Moraz, then recently of the short-lived resurrection of Nice, with Moraz in the Emerson role, which was Refugee. The band also did this record in some kind of portable studio, and the unfortunate result is the worst-sounding YES production job prior to the Tormato album.<br /><br />But the track GATES OF DELIRIUM is a fantastic sonic impression of war, with sometimes forced-sounding lyrics. It has also been alleged that the melody of the closing section, \\"Soon\\" was a clever shoplift from the then recent hit record by Barbara Steisand, \\"The Way We Were\\" from the film soundtrack of the same name. In Gates, Steve Howe's guitar playing is the key factor, both in leading the band and in establishing the sonic atmosphere of the piece; Moraz is limited to playing filler on GATES, in which it is apparent in interviews of the time that the keyboard parts were already written and presented to him by other members of the band when he joined. But this record has the great \\"Soundchaser\\" on it, a track the writing of which was also begun before Moraz joined, but his contribution to it in its completion was the definitive factor in making this one of the single most memorable YES Songs ever. YES as a jazz-rock fusion band! It's like King Crimson's B-side to STARLESS AND BIBLE BLACK but with more compositional structure! At first it sounds like Return to Forever, Mahavishnu, and Argent all rolled into a single YES tune, but over the years the tune wears incredibly well and can be viewed from today's vantage point as an ideal mesh of dynamic instrumental arranging and popular songwriting. \\"Soundchaser\\" is, in fact, evidence of the 'Road not Taken' by YES; because they never made another record with Moraz and left off the fusion path after his departure in 1976.<br />Oh, and \\"To Be Over\\" is a sweet, calming number to have on this album after all the frenetic but fantastic music which preceeds.enetic but fantastic music which preceeds.
B000002UAX|5.0|The track is 'Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey' by Paul McCartney. It was released on his 1971 album 'Ram'.
B00007LTIC|5.0|This was the Yes comeback record after two 1/2 years of tours, solo albums, compilations of earlier recordings, and critical disdain of their two previous studio creations: TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS & RELAYER. All of the music is great, but the crowning achievement of this album is the proud offering of \\"Awaken\\", the band's last extended-length song. If all of the other tracks on this album were bad, (and they're not- the other songs are all very strong) it would still be worth the purchase just to have \\"Awaken.\\" This song has all of the majesty, all of the feelling, that the music from TALES has, but in a much more simply-stated scope of music. In fact, back in the summer of 1973, when YES was recording the TALES album, singer-songwriter Jon Anderson stated in an interview, as part of a response to critical gripes that YES's music direction has lost a lot of people who liked songs such as \\"Roundabout\\" or \\"Your Move\\" that the YES objective was to achieve \\"simplicity through complexity.\\" A Zen-sounding oral puzzle that was, but after listening to \\"Awaken\\" one might realize that with this song YES had done exactly that: found simplity of fine expression through complex ambition.<br /><br />Now, I would like to add that I do have some picky stuff to bring up about this album. If I had been their executive producer, in the style of the old days when producers did more than shape sound, they actually determined what an album would be like; i would have switched the placement of the title song with Parallels on the album, making Parallels the opening song and Going For the One the third track. I also would have told the band to name the album \\"Awaken\\" or maybe \\"Turn of the Century\\" or even \\"Parallels\\" but not Going for the One. I also would have scrapped this cover design and placed another call to Roger Dean.
B00005ASOI|2.0|It has some very scary moments like the opening murder scene which is extremely gory and unneccessarily stupid and the final scene. But many of the goings on between the murders are actually quite boring and Argento for no apparent reason shoves in red and green colors into the film from time to time, like that's anyway to create an eerie atmosphere. Like the scene where the girls sleep in an outside hall. Why have they got bright red lights on while they're sleeping? How does the lights from the street turn from green to red so fast while Suzy is travelling in the cab. Street light don't have that strange green color anyway. Oh wait, this is somebody's idea of art, after all it's worked on so many viewers. I'd say Argento is over the top in cheesy artsy fartsyness and the samples of the murder scenes from his other movies I've seen only confirms this in my mind. You want some real suspence and horror watch The Tenant or Rosemary's baby. Movies like Susperia are really not far ahead of Scream or the over hyped Ring.
0786856297|5.0|We believe that the time of the Olympians has passed. The Greek myths were just a quaint way of explaining forces of nature to an ancient people, right? Well, what if the gods were still hanging around and getting involved with mortals and having kids like Hercules et al.? What if you were one of those kids but you did not know it?<br /><br />Percy Jackson is a dyslexic, ADHD, underachieving, social misfit. He has changed schools so many times he has lost count. His only friend is a weird little guy named Grover who gets picked on by bullies. One day on a class field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art Percy's pre-algebra teacher turns into a Fury and tries to kill him in front of a Greek marble frieze. If this is not shocking enough, his Latin teacher suddenly appears and tosses him a pen which turns into a sword in his hand that he uses to vaporize the Fury. When no one, including his Latin teacher seems to remember the math teacher or have noticed the event Percy begins to doubt his grip on reality. Percy soon discovers the truth of his parentage and then he is running for his life.<br /><br />The story follows a traditional line: three young ones undertake a quest to save the world. In this case they must recover Zeus's master bolt which has been stolen. The book is a fun and quick read with lots of action. If you are a kid who knows that the name of the three headed dog guarding the entrance to the Underworld is NOT \\"Fluffy\\" but Cerberus I can promise you that you will LOVE this book. If you do not know much about the Greek myths, this book will send you running for D'Aulaire's.
0307165485|5.0|Of the dozens of books I had as a kid, this was by far my favorite. I made my parents read it to me so many times (even acting out some of the stories) that now, 25 years later, my dad says he could probably recite it by heart. It's bright pictures and wide variety of sweet, simple stories makes it ideal for any child. My crayon scribbled words throughout its pages are proof that it was instrumental in helping me learn to read and write.  I've bought it as a gift for many of my friends' kids and a few months ago when I found out I was pregnant with my first child, I couldn't wait to buy it for the baby. (Although I still have my copy, it's too tattered to pass along). I highly recommend this to anyone with a preschooler. UPDATE: My 2 year old has had this book 3 months and it is hands down his favorite. He wants to \\"read\\" it several times a day. It has enough different stories and pictures that we never get tired of reading it to him.  Bunnies, tractors, airplanes, babies or puppies - no matter what his favorite thing is this week, there's a story about it in this book!
B00005ATQD|3.0|This review is based on an American release DVD version of the film, unnfortunately.  Had I seen this on the big screen, and had I seen it without the editing by U.S. censors, perhaps my experience would have been better.  But I don't want to blame censors either; it would have been better to allow an X rating and show it uncensored than to allow the changes that were made.  The problem was that it wouldn't have made as much money, of course.  And then there would have been the stigma of having an X-rated movie one one's resume for all actors involved, as well ...  <br /> <br />This was intended as an antithesis to the late 20th Century self-indulgent \\"coming-of-age movie,\\" such as most notably Cruise's \\"Risky Business\\" (and I think that is in fact the reason for such casting) and as such I can sort of enjoy it.  But the dragging, miserable dialogue, the horrible background music, an attempt at a Hitchcock-like piano, and the overall hackneyed adaptation of a ~ 1920's Viennese novel, all made for a miserable film experience.   <br /> <br />The film is generally about the miasma of anxiety and paranoia surrounding the sex act in the late 20th C, and the social and classist ramifications thereof.  While a worthy topic, the execution was weak, esp. in the casting and dialogue.  I think Kidman was pretty good, but her lines were utterly miserable. And Cruise was at his DeNiro-imitator worst. (Really, we only need one DeNiro.) <br /> <br />BTW, all the fluster about the nudity in this film is mostly by mouth-breathers who expected another classic hot Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman movie.  Recalling the deluge of ads at metro stations and bus stops when this was released, I think most viewers expected a \\"hot summer movie\\" where Cruise and Kidman would \\"sizzle,\\" but they certainly didn't expect realistic nudity. Perhaps a naughty dance scene, or a stripper in it somewhere, but not this kind of nudity, which was clearly not intended to get one's panties wet.) Instead they gota movie that might have helped Cruise and Kidman along with their divorce, and leave viewers (those who actually stayed in the theatre to the bitter end) with a general creepy feeling.  No \\"Top Gun\\" experience here!  <br /> <br />But as a feller who has enjoyed Kubrick's movies over the years and who looked forward to a chilling, suspenseful experience, I was disappointed.  I am sad he has passed, and I think had he been able to finish this project it would have turned out much better. I will probably never bother to purchase a foreign version so I can see the real movie, but it was a puny tragedy that I had to watch a censored version.
1592401791|5.0|The main idea of this book is to provide a different way of looking at The Beatles.  Emerick does not attempt to offer your standard Fab Four biograpghy, or any inside gossip and such. Rather, he gives a very clear and enjoyable look at how the music of the group was recorded at EMI Abbey Road Studio.  The book is technical enough to show how the sounds were made, but not so technical that you need to be an engineer yourself to get it. Emerick also gives a great look at how EMI had a strict set of rules that recording sessions were obligated to follow-that is until The Beatles changed all that. Emerick gives a fair and balanced look at all the people involved and limits himself to what he actually was a part of, with none of the sensationalistic 'scoops' that some Beatles authors claim to know.  A great look at how the songs were made.
B00062J00S|5.0|Heartwarming. A story that demonstrates just how important each person is in life. A great movie for the family. You will need a box of tissues to watch this movie. It touches the heart. I highly recommend this movie for families.
6300216543|4.0|Serpico, 1973 film <br /> <br />The opening lists the names of the people who worked on this film, adapted from the Peter Maas book. The first scenes show a wounded Serpico being sped to a hospital. Serpico thinks back to his beginning as a policeman. He will be tested as to his character while fighting crime. Serpico is taught how the system works while he is on the job. An arrested rapist is encouraged to inform on his playmates; Serpico uses diplomacy and learns more. Serpico joins the Identification Division to advance his career. Serpico gets the label of \\"weirdo\\" and hangs out with artists (or beatniks?). Serpico's grooming allow him to be well disguised. He learns that who you know is important (as in other fields of work).  <br /> <br />The story continues and shows Serpico's experiences at work in New York City. His police partners work hard at their job. Serpico works undercover. He trusts his handler; but is his trust misplaced? The political reality is that the system exists with the knowledge and tolerance of the rulers. [This is another example of the feudal system, as in politics; those who swear fealty to the ruler are always rewarded.] <br /> <br />The Commissioner tells the police brass to go ahead and investigate corruption. But rumors about Serpico abound among the police. Serpico will talk, but he won't testify against the other policemen. He is warned about what can happen if the force is not with him. [Can any institution be reformed from within?] <br /> <br />The 'NY Times' prints a front-page story, and the Whitman-Knapp Commission starts to investigate. Serpico is transferred to Brooklyn South to work on drug dealers; this could be dangerous. Then a drug bust goes wrong and Serpico is shot. His gold shield (#761) came through (he is now a first-grade detective). But the wound damages his hearing in his left ear and affects his left side. The film ends by showing Serpico making a speech. But what has really changed since then? There are parts in this film that suggest it was oriented to a foreign audience. The film suggests no answers to the recurring problem of big city corruption. Would placing the police in the Civil Service system prevent corruption? Does it work with other government agencies? Or is corruption inherent in our civilization, like human error? <br />
B000B5QWKG|5.0|I'm a big Franz Ferdinand fan and finally got to see them in concert, just before this album was released.  I have to say, that this album absolutely captures the energy and excitement their concerts provide.  The music is wonderful.  Their songs range from exciting and fun like \\"Do You Want To?,\\" mellow and melodic like \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots Back On\\" and dark and sexy like \\"Evil and a Heathen.\\"  I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoyed their last album and anyone who just wants music they can dance to.   <br /> <br />As for the Dual Disc issue, I enjoyed it, simply because I can watch the video for \\"Do You Want To?\\" over and over again.  For me, that alone was worth paying for it.  If you want something more than that, just buy the regular version.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is now like one of my favorite movies, it has a weird storyline at first that is pretty hard to grasp, and most people won't understand it the first viewing, or maybe at all unless you look for an explanation somewhere on the net.  But if ya give it a chance, it's a really great movie.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|Ok lets be honest. This is not the thrash your head till you bleed album that one expects from Zombie. However, it is still rock and roll hall of fame worthy. The Zombie I have been a fan of for so long has grown and changed. I must admit a slight fear during the first listen about how heavy it was, but by the end of the cd I feel this is one of the best. Reading other reviews I understand each opinion, but Rob Zombie has not let us fans down. Instead he has given us new hope in the future of Zombie. With the long break from recording I was worried that this was the last of our famed rocker. I now have new hope to see future albums and growth. To the reveiwer who said Zombie did not really try on this album, i say shove it. I think this is one of the greatest efforts an artist has given.I think this album finally shows the true core of Rob. So join me, raise your hands high and jump like there is no tomorrow. Rob Zombie is back and better than ever.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Trent Reznor is back, with a new drug-free lifestyle, a fresh outlook on life, and one pissed off record which gives no indication of the first two points. With Teeth is the latest NIN outing since The Fragile's two disc epic release, and ultimately a tighter album in overall structure from The Downward Spiral and The Fragile, both records which interspersed tracks of pure static, electric insanity among the more structured songs. Not so with Reznor's latest audio monster, upon which almost every song is presented in catchy, pop-like structures which almost defy the angst-ridden lyrics and abrasive music which is contained in them. With Teeth is a record meant to present the mentality of being unsure of oneself, and the lyrics do the usual depression-laden justice so such a gloomy theme, almost all of the songs using the experience of love gone wrong to lead us through Trent's tormented and angry mind. The cohesiveness of the record harkens us NIN fans back to the days of Pretty Hate Machine's pop qualities, being not nearly as sprawling or ambitious as The Fragile, and the change, in my opinion, is a positive one. <br /> <br />The most notable difference between this one and other Reznor releases is that NIN now sounds more like a live band than a one-man synthesizer assault, Dave Grohl's unique drum style contributing highly to dragging Reznor away from his drum machines and keyboards, although the electronic ambience can still be found lurking in the background of every track. It now seems that the sonic keyboard effects which made Reznor famous have taken a backseat to an acoustic piano, and the playing presents Reznor's classical piano playing in a form that is rarely exposed through his music, the instruments light, soothing touch providing a small sense of comfort and a contradictory sense of beauty behind the madness. <br /> <br />Don't worry though, if one thing is true it's that NIN definitely isn't going soft. Aside from the tear-jerking album closer of Right Where It Belongs, which immediately brings to mind images of Hurt, every track on With Teeth drives forward with the fury of a man possessed, You Know What You Are? and Only tearing out of the speakers with a metal fury which is unparralleled. Trent might be 40 years old now, but he certainly doesn't show any signs of aging. Those worried that the Pretty Hate Machine-esque synth rock is gone from the classic NIN sound will also find comfort in The Hand That Feeds and Beside You In Time. To sum it all up, everyone complaining about how much this record sucks and how Trent has sold out really needs to grow up. Though it is somewhat of a departure from the bands former sound, With Teeth still stays close enough to Reznor's classic touch to be comfortable for any fan, and though the whole album might take a few listens to appreciate as a whole, anyone saying that the songs aren't damn catchy is only lying to themself.
1400062756|5.0|I was fortunate to have read the author's previous work, Self-theories, a collection of essays exploring her research into motivational patterns and achievement, and while I found her prose wonderfully accessible and lucid, especially for an academician and researcher, I wondered how she would fare in Mindset, which goes head-to-head with books in the pop-psychology mainstream. I was delighted to find that she has fleshed out the theories and conclusions from Self-theories in a light, fast-moving and enthusiastic style that makes for a compulsive read. <br /> <br />My son goes to a recently-formed progressive school where students have a lot of input into the class offerings and teaching styles are quite varied and adventurous.  If enough want a course, the school strives to make it available within the mandatory class requirements.  So languages, for instance, include French, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic and American Sign Language.  I gave a copy of Self-theories to the founder and driving force of the school and he devoured it, claiming he now had a powerful academic foundation to answer those curious about and critical of the school's approach.  I think he will find Mindset an even more persuasive tool, since it shows in example-laden manner how mindsets developed early in life can dictate our potential and our limitations - and what we can do about it at any stage in our lives. <br /> <br />What makes Mindset particularly compelling is the avalanche of vivid stories from lives of the ordinary and the celebrated in the worlds of business, science, education and sports.  (Some readers may be surprised, as I was, to find a respected professor of psychology to be almost exhaustively knowledgeable about sports and its superstars, as well as the ins and outs of the corporate world.)  Each chapter is filled with anecdotes from everyday people as well as names still making headlines today, demonstrating how a fixed mindset can constrict a life while a growth mindset can liberate and empower one.  And Dweck is refreshingly fearless in taking some of our major icons of public life to task, in often tart prose, for their failures and stubborn blunders.  John McEnroe, Lee Iacocca, Bobby Knight and others come under her knife.  There's a certain wicked satisfaction to be found in puncturing the self-importance of the rich and fatuous.  She even turns the lens of her criticism to her own life, reviewing not only her successes but also the failings and her struggles to apply the insights she's exploring.  <br /> <br />While each chapter also ends with a checklist for evaluating one's own mindset and its life consequences and there's something of a primer for shifting mindsets at the end, this is not merely a how-to manual.  It's the cumulative effect of the individual stories that makes the most persuasive argument for Dweck's theories.  I find myself coming up with my own examples of dueling mindsets among family, friends and co-workers, so apparently merely reading the book (and it's a quick 255 pages) begins building the recognition skills the author stresses as an important first step to making changes in one's own life.  And as she carefully points out, it's never too late to change a mindset that is limiting one's potential and accomplishment in any aspect of life, including love and relationships. <br />
B00005JKZV|5.0|Everything that came as a shock last December, when ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' was released, we're ready for now: the surging, unfamiliar New Zealand landscapes that serve so well as Middle-earth, the way director Peter Jackson creates a privileged aura of legend while propelling the story forward, the preposterous rightness of Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, and - really, who knew? - Liv Tyler as Arwen.<br /><br />The miracle is that ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' is better: tighter, smarter, funnier, and graced with a more realized sense of epochs shifting on the actions of smallish individuals. It builds cleanly toward the climactic battle of Helm's Deep instead of constantly pausing, as ''Fellowship'' did, for a series of donnybrooks. And it introduces a character who, in Jackson's imagining of him, provides the one thing Tolkien never had much use for: dramatic irony.<br /><br />That character is Gollum, and he catches up with Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin) early on in the new movie. Since the Fellowship abruptly splintered at the end of the last installment, ''Towers'' shuttles back and forth between the group's constituent parts. Pressing into the country of Rohan to confront the armies of bad-seed wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) are the three warriors: human Aragorn (Mortensen, eye candy for the ladies), elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom, ditto for the teenage girls), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies, comic relief for everyone else).<br /><br />Spare-wheel hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are captives of Saruman's orcs until they are rescued by Treebeard the Ent, who is perhaps best described as the apple tree from ''The Wizard of Oz'' minus the sociopathic urges. Frodo and Sam, of course, are bound for Mordor to drop Sauron's one true Ring of power into the fires in which it was forged. Since AAAdoesn't exactly provide a Triptik for this sort of thing, the two are forced to rely on the guidance of Gollum, the slimy, devolved flapdoodle who lost the Ring to Frodo's Uncle Bilbo back in ''The Hobbit'' and who has been lusting slurpily after his ''precious'' ever since.<br /><br />Gollum is a computer-generated character, and your heart may sink when he first waddles into sight: with his perfectly mottled skin, street-lamp eyes, and deftly rendered strands of lank hair, he pulls the film in the direction of a high-end video game. But the kindness with which Frodo treats Gollum short-circuits the creature's rage and leads to some marvelously bipolar dialogues between his good and evil sides. Gollum's voice and movements are provided by Andy Serkis, and it's a tribute to the actor that by the time ''Towers'' comes crashing to a close, we've accepted Gollum as a full-time member of the crew - and by far the most interestingly conflicted.<br /><br />True to Tolkien, everyone else is stalwart in heart and deed, and thus a bit of a stick. Characters don't speak in ''Lord of the Rings,'' they declaim, and all that earnestness might pall if the scope of ''Towers'' weren't so convincingly epic. The audience jaws start dropping from the very first scene, which rewinds to Gandalf's battle with the Balrog from ''Fellowship'' but this time plunges over the cliff with the combatants as they wrassle and smite in midair.<br /><br />It's a sequence most movies would save as a capper; Jackson serving it up before the opening credits roll is just his waggish way of reminding you who's boss.<br /><br />The main action in ''Towers'' centers on the kingdom of Rohan, which is being assaulted by the combined armies of Sauron and Saruman as a prelude to a full-on conquest of Middle-earth. King Theoden (Bernard Hill) is under the spell of evil adviser Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) - do you deserve to be king if you hire an adviser named Grima Wormtongue? - the prince is dead, his cousin Eomer (Karl Urban) exiled, and Eomer's tough-but-tender sister Eowyn (Miranda Otto) besieged by Grima's unwanted attentions.<br /><br />When Aragorn and the others arrive to buck up the Rohanians' esprit de corps, he and Eowyn exchange a few heavy-lidded looks - and a good thing, too, since Otto is the most warm-blooded actress to wander into these movies yet. Aragorn's heart, though, remains with faraway elf princess Arwen, and, anyway, who has time for first dates when the armies of the night are approaching in all their terrible computer-generated splendor?<br /><br />Jackson is one of the very few directors able to fluently combine live-action footage and digital animation, and he has a gift for pop-Wagnerian grandeur that reclaims cinema's primal power. The skirmish midway through between the heroes and Saruman's hyena-riding troops rivals Kurosawa's desperate choreography, and the Helm's Deep wrap-up is as clear as a military diagram and a frightening, panicky chaos.<br /><br />It's all hooey, of course - unless you're an adolescent or a Tolkien addict, you have to admit this - but it's hooey with conviction, muscle, and wit, and for the film's three hours you're raised up into the kind of exalted storytelling that the ''Star Wars'' and ''Harry Potter'' movies only feebly promise. George Lucas should watch this and hang his head in shame.<br /><br />A final thought: ''Towers'' is a war film when all is said and done and some will take that all the way to the metaphorical bank. Is it a coincidence that the movie appears as America tries to reinvent itself as a lean, mean aggression machine? Well, yes, it is. In point of fact, ''The Lord of the Rings'' makes a lousy recruiting poster, devoted as it is to the notion that war is hell on Middle-earth.<br /><br />Anyway, the major structural problem with the story has always been that its archvillain, Sauron, is a smoke-and-mirrors bugaboo - a barely anthropomorphized stand-in for whatever you think is wrong with the world.

Bush.sister Eowyn (Miranda Otto) besieged by Grima's unwanted attentions.  <br /> <br />When Aragorn and the others arrive to buck up the Rohanians' esprit de corps, he and Eowyn exchange a few heavy-lidded looks - and a good thing, too, since Otto is the most warm-blooded actress to wander into these movies yet. Aragorn's heart, though, remains with faraway elf princess Arwen, and, anyway, who has time for first dates when the armies of the night are approaching in all their terrible computer-generated splendor?  <br /> <br />Jackson is one of the very few directors able to fluently combine live-action footage and digital animation, and he has a gift for pop-Wagnerian grandeur that reclaims cinema's primal power. The skirmish midway through between the heroes and Saruman's hyena-riding troops rivals Kurosawa's desperate choreography, and the Helm's Deep wrap-up is as clear as a military diagram and a frightening, panicky chaos.  <br /> <br />It's all hooey, of course - unless you're an adolescent or a Tolkien addict, you have to admit this - but it's hooey with conviction, muscle, and wit, and for the film's three hours you're raised up into the kind of exalted storytelling that the ''Star Wars'' and ''Harry Potter'' movies only feebly promise. George Lucas should watch this and hang his head in shame.  <br /> <br />A final thought: ''Towers'' is a war film when all is said and done and some will take that all the way to the metaphorical bank. Is it a coincidence that the movie appears as America tries to reinvent itself as a lean, mean aggression machine? Well, yes, it is. In point of fact, ''The Lord of the Rings'' makes a lousy recruiting poster, devoted as it is to the notion that war is hell on Middle-earth. <br /> <br /> <br />Anyway, the major structural problem with the story has always been that its archvillain, Sauron, is a smoke-and-mirrors bugaboo - a barely anthropomorphized stand-in for whatever you think is wrong with the world. Some have decoded him asHitler, while others believe Tolkien's gripe is against the modern industrialist state. If you want to see Saddam Hussein in that fiery eye of Mordor, be my guest - if you squint, Christopher Lee's Saruman might even pass for Osama bin Laden - but keep in mind that it would be just as easy for someone else to see George W. Bush.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|Maybe you are thinking what I was thinking when I first heard about this movie.  \\"Oh great, they are making a cute movie out of a horrible problem called addiction, and are going to sum up rehab in a darling, romanticized way.\\"  I refused to watch it for a long time because of this presumption.  Relax, and give the film a try.  Although cute in places and using some subtle but great humor, '28 Days' does not romanticize the problem of addiction.<br /><br />What it does manage to show, much to my amazement, is how trite and cheesy 'Recovery' can seem to the addict.  The scenes of chanting, serenity prayers, and singing 'Lean On Me' are not portrayed as inspiring or moving, but as irritating customs of the Center.  Perhaps portions of the movie go to the far edges of each condition, drunkenness and sobriety, but it does not come across as contrived.  People really do these things, and some people really recover from it, and '28 Days' follows Gwen Cummings story, who is an exceptionally \\"gravitational\\" personality, easily allowing for a larger than life story.<br /><br />Gwen (Sandra Bullock) is a writer, and along with party-time boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West) show up late and manage to ruin her sister Lily's (Elizabeth Perkins) wedding.  After being late, Gwen ruins the mother-in-law's dress, takes a spin on the dance floor and winds out crushing the wedding cake, then steals a limo to drive to a cake store and replace it.  Careening down the road, Gwen wrecks the limo into the side of a house.  Sentenced to twenty-eight days in rehab or prison, Gwen finds herself at the Serenity Glen Rehabilitation Center.<br /><br />Gwen's lifestyle as a New York writer/columnist is not conductive to sobriety, but even Gwen never realized the extent of her reliance on booze and prescription drugs.  Not until she breaks the rules of Serenity Glen and her counselor Cornell (played by the amazing Steve Buscemi) arranges to have her sentence continued in prison.  Only when Gwen practically leaps from a third story window in an attempt to retrieve the pills from Jasper that she earlier threw away does Gwen realize something is wrong with her.  She decides its time to do something for herself, and convinces Cornell to let her stay at Serenity Glen.<br /><br />Gwen must face many aspects of herself that she finds intolerable while sober, while also facing visits from Jasper who doesn't see the point of leaving their old life behind for sobriety.  What follows is a touching, and yes, comical romp through Gwen's rehab, but it fits well because Gwen has a tendency to use humor to deflect emotional response.<br /><br />The characters in this movie are outstanding.  Sandra Bullock plays Gwen to perfection.  Steve Buscemi is amazing as always, Dominic West as fun-boy Jasper is perfect, and look for a ridiculously intriguing performance by Alan Tudyk as Gerhardt, the funniest character in the movie.  Gerhardt is an eccentric, over-the-top, emotional, stammering geek, and steals the movie with only a few lines.  (\\"Oh my God, look at my package!\\" and \\"I want my foreskin back, no one asked when they took it, they just took it.\\")  Also, at the very end of the movie, check out Gerhardt's T-shirt that he's wearing.  Hysterical!!<br /><br />Even through the horrid cheesiness of ridiculous rehab ritual, Gwen manages to make friends.  Aside from Gerhardt, there is Daniel (Reni Santoni) the doctor who used to pump his own stomach, Andrea (Azura Skye), Gwen's roommate, a seventeen year old heroin addict who is far wiser than her years, Betty (Margo Martindale) as the crotchety but not humorless receptionist, and Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortenson) a professional baseball player addicted to booze and sex.<br /><br />I was surprised at how well this movie actually turned out, comparing in my opinion to the classics 'Days Of Wine And Roses' and 'Lost Weekend'.  Pay special attention to Cornell's speech for the group, where he talks about using whether something happened or nothing happened.  While there is good humor in this movie, and it realistically portrays the cheesiness of all those rehab clich&eacute;s, it still winds out to be a good (though somewhat tragic) story about a good person.  Gwen is obviously a loveable personality, both drunk and sober, which makes her choice more realistic than someone who makes a \\"dramatic change\\".  There is a very funny scene where Gwen uses her talents as a writer to create an impromptu play based on Andrea's favorite soap opera, Santa Cruz.  The clips of this soap opera are so over the top that you will laugh your hinder off at them.<br /><br />Great acting, fantastic characterizations, good photography, a healthy dose of realism, a great script, and insightfully surreal flashbacks made this movie much better than it should have been.  Oh, and it made me thirsty (he  he he).  Definitely a 'buy', but I always recommend rent first.  Enjoy!happened or nothing happened.

B000ENWKN8|3.0|Following the release of 2001's \\"Sinister Urge,\\" Rob Zombie took a little hiatus away from music. During this five year absence, Rob made two feature films, so it was questionable if he would ever return to music, or just focus on his movie career full time. But now his fans can rejoice because Rob has finally returned with a new studio album.<br /><br />\\"Educated Horses\\" keeps the b-side/horror movie samples to a minimum, so it may very well be the most focused and professional album of Rob's long and storied career. Plus, as songs like the churning \\"American Witch,\\" and the rhythmic \\"17 Year Locust\\" show, Rob still knows his way around a good hook. And there are a handful of standout tracks on here. \\"The Scorpion Sleeps\\" features a catchy stop-start beat with stutter-stepping guitars; songs like \\"Let It All Bleed Out\\" and \\"Ride\\" are backed by a powerful chug and churn guitar lead; and \\"Death Of It All\\" has a beautiful acoustic guitar intro/outro and an unexpected, hooky hand-clap pattern.<br /><br />But, unfortunately, \\"Educated Horses\\" has just as many drawbacks as good aspects. Firstly, there are no classics anywhere on here, and no songs that are anywhere near as good or memorable as, say, \\"Dragula,\\" \\"Living Dead Girl,\\" or \\"Never Gonna Stop.\\" It's doubtful that any of \\"Educated Horses\\" will stick with you or bounce around your head for very long.<br /><br />Next, this is doubtlessly Rob's most experimental and least heavy album. The single, \\"Foxy Foxy,\\" has a syncopated beat and digitized/electronic vocals, whereas songs like the aforementioned \\"17 Year Locust\\" and \\"The Devil's Rejects\\" feature (what could be) a sitar. Experimentation isn't inherently a bad thing, but most would agree that heavy songs are catchier, more infectious, more exciting/exhilarating, and hold the listener's attention better.<br /><br />Finally, the biggest flaw this C.D. has is that, like most RZ discs, \\"Educated Horses\\" is WAY too short. At a mere 11 tracks (with only nine of those being actual songs) and 39 minutes, it doesn't have time to be to wow the listener or be a satisfying step forward from \\"Sinister Urge.\\" It's curious that it took Rob this long to make a C.D. that's this brief.<br /><br />So, there are a few good tunes here, but, as a whole, \\"Educated Horses\\" just kind of falls flat and isn't memorable. In fact, it's probably Rob Zombie's weakest album (that he's made by himself or with White Zombie). If you're not a diehard fan who needs a complete collection, you can definitely afford to skip this one or buy it used.es, it doesn't have time to be to wow the listener or be a satisfying step forward from \\"Sinister Urge.\\" It's curious that it took Rob this long to make a C.D. that's this brief.

0765348780|1.0|I have discovered a new level of writing beneath the pulp of Goodkind and Jordan, and it is The Malazan Book of the Fallen.  A few pages in, this book struck me as a gussied-up transcript of a some kid's Dungeons & Dragons adventure.  Sadly, a quick wikipedia search confirmed this (well, it was the GURPS RPG system, but close enough). <br /> <br />There is absolutely no character development, no interesting themes, not even a spark of dramatic tension.  As one might expect from its origins, the story contains a hodgepodge of names and settings with little underlying consistency.  The book masks its lack of depth with needless complexity.  I don't mind complex storylines, but the lack of payoff left me feeling robbed of my time. <br /> <br />I'm sure Mr. Erikson runs a fine game of Dungeons & Dragons.  I just don't want to read about it.
B00013F38K|2.0|I love the content and watch the series religeously when it was on originally. So I wanted to collect the DVD's. First I ordered all three seasons as a set and after four weeks Amazon cancelled my order because it was back ordered and wasn't being filled. So, I spent extra money and ordered each season separately.  <br /> <br />Then I receive the three seasons worth of discs and begin to watch them and I enjoy them thoroughly until I get to the second disc on the first season. The disc freezes part way through an episode. So, I send them back for replacement. I get the new set of discs and finish watching the second disc and I get part way through the third disc and it freezes again. So, I try to return it again and Amazon says it won't replace but will give me a refund. So, I get the refund on the first season. <br /> <br />Now I am watching the second season and it freezes on the first disc. GRRRRR <br /> <br />I have tried both of my DVD players and my computers and they all freeze at the same point so I know the discs are bad. <br /> <br />The moral of my story is. The content is great if the manufacturer would make the disc of better quality. Cheap transfers make for bad discs and unsatisfied customers. <br /> <br />If you buy these check all discs before the expiration of the return period. <br /> <br />Archon
B000AP04FG|5.0|Okay, this was not your run of the mill action film. This was very different. This was your basic married couple, who are trying to work through their problems. Especially, now when they find out that the other is a hired assassin and they've been contracted to kill each other. Which makes things very interesting.
0380820846|4.0|I had read `the viscount who loved me' from Julia Quinn before this one which was much better than Colin and Penelope's story, but this one was also good.  In this book hero and heroine were not burning up with lust for each other like they did in her earlier novels. And I think there was a reason for the slow build up of passion between Colin and Penelope. After all they had known each other for most of their lives. It just wouldn't feel right if suddenly they, especially Colin would start lusting after the woman he barely looked at earlier. Well Penelope always had feeling for him, so it was different for her.<br /><br />I find it very erotic in a romance if hero and heroine were good friends and slowly they realize their feelings run deeper and discover each other. The scene when Penelope asked Colin to kiss her was the turning point I think for this couple. The scene was very well written. And somehow Penelope wasn't sounding as pathetic as she must have felt at the time she asked Colin to kiss her because she didn't want to die without ever being kissed.<br /><br />I must admit that this books preoccupation with lady Whistledown did get on my nerves at times, but in the end it was clear there was a reason to it.<br /><br />Another sweet romance by Miss Quinn.
B00005JMAH|5.0|After, a really bad incident that takes place at the Dursleys. Harry is taken to meet with the magic counsel and fines out that a mass murder named Sirus Black is looking for him. Possibly, to get revenge on him. The magic counsel has sent some special guards called \\"Dementors\\" to guard Hogwarts. Just in case, if Sirus shows up there. But, Harry is thinking there is more to this than what he is being told. That and Harry also thinks that this is maybe connected to his past and his parents death.
B000AADYYO|5.0|This title is an obvious mashup of Porcupine Tree and this album's title. Is that a bad thing? No. <br /> <br />Steve Wilson's atmospheric crunch is splattered all over this album, even turning Mikael Akerfeldt into a waxing poetic anxiously calm brit at times, but the stylistic collision is perfect. <br /> <br />\\"The Ghosts of Perdition\\" apes both PT and Tool, while leaving classic Opeth ebow and unusual harmonic twists. It sets the stage for the rest of the album. <br /> <br />\\"The Baying of the Hounds\\" devolves from heavy metal to what sounds like it will be a Damnation-esque moody folk-jazz doom rock piece, only to pick up a tremelo-laden electric piano that made me remember the \\"7th Guest\\" computer game sound track (!!) <br /> <br />\\"Reverie / Harlquin Forest\\" is another sprawling, pure Opeth track, this time taking the somber and atmospheric electric guitars to the next level with the recent influx of keyboards and Wilson's influence. <br /> <br />\\"Hours of Wealth\\" is easily the best song on the album, a stunning near-acapella ending with a jazz-blues guitar solo. <br /> <br />All in all, this is death metal for people who don't like death metal, goth metal for people who don't like goth metal, and progressive metal for someone who needs a little more metal than progressive.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I must admit that seeing this movie with my girlfriend and her mother made me skidish, and there were sections of the movie that expressed physical passion which made me, feel somewhat uncomfortable.  However, if YOU the reader are willing to expose yourself to fresh material, and original characters, the film is beautiful.  It would not have worked in any other setting (I felt the scenery was a third character).  I agree with those who feel that cheating on their wives and children were wrong in any capacity, but that is not the point.  The point is that the two characters are not allowed to be who they truly are and would have been together forever had it not been for society's stigma towards homosexuality (\\"case and point\\" all of the brokeback jokes flying around, and crazed \\"top 10\\" religious reasons why this movie is a sin).  It truly deserved to win an Academy Award, and it not winning (partly because some Academy voters never even saw it) is just another \\"case and point\\" example of narrow-mindedness!
B000BBOUU4|5.0|I was always a large fan of the Gene Wilder version over the yeras, since I was a child, and I knew that any \\"remake\\" would have to work *hard* to earn my admiration and respect.  Not to mention I'd always had very little respect for Tim Burton and I'd never seen Johnny Depp. <br /> <br />So when I settled into the theatre to watch this movie, I was both astonished and very, very pleased.  Generally this version stays closer to the original book than the first movie, and Charile just stays an ordinary little boy having an extraordinary adventure.  Depp as Wonka evoked many powerful emotions in me--the character hates children, dislikes being touched, and uses outdated slang, but is very passionate for his candy and, coupled with the flashback bits, there's a hint of deep sadness in him.  I loved how the movie was resolved; however that resolution involves a Wonka backstory that was in neither the book nor the first movie.  Still, I think it fits perfectly. <br /> <br />I would reccommend this movie to most, except for very young children.  Some of the demise of the 'Ticket Winners' in this movie may frighten a very young child under, say, six.
B000023VR6|5.0|Legendary West Coast producer and rapper / emcee Dr. Dre release after critically acclaimed debut solo The Chronic.  2001 followed closely to the same format with additional production help from long time prot&eacute;g&eacute; Mel-Man.  \\"Lolo Intro\\" featuring Xzibit & Tray-Dee introduces the West Cost styling of California's lowrider bouncing.  This album solidified Dr. Dre as a triple threat, an executive, a producer and an artist.  The production contains a gangster funk groove with the signature kicks and drum patterns.  Dre's lyrics were personally tailored with industry facts and emotional attachments such as the titles \\"The Watcher\\", \\"Still D.R.E.\\" featuring Snoop Dogg, \\"Big Ego's\\" featuring Hittman, \\"What's The Difference\\" featuring Eminem & Xzibit, \\"Forgot About Dre\\" featuring Eminem and \\"The Message\\" featuring Mary J. Blige & Rell for example.  To give the album more depth, \\"F*ck You\\" featuring Devin the Dude & Snoop Dogg and \\"Xxplosive\\" featuring Hittman, Kurupt, Nate Dogg & Six-Two are explicit sexual tales.  The more gangster attempts \\"Murder Ink\\" featuring Hittman & Ms. Roq and \\"Bang Bang\\" featuring Knoc-Turn'al & Hittman definitely are highlights of this album's complete feel.  \\"Some L.A. Niggaz\\" featuring DeFari, Xzibit, Knoc-Turn'al, Time Bomb, King T, MC Ren & Kokane is a good collaboration of styles found in Los Angeles and Compton emcees / rappers.  This album is only an interlude to the Southern Hip-hop / rap takeover as this LP is a breath of fresh air or Chronic for that matter.
0062502182|2.0|I had been looking forward to reading the Alchemist for a long time. When I finally got around to reading it I must say it was a terrible disappointment. While I appreciate the simplicity of the story and the message it conveys, I just think this book was, for lack of a better word, cheesy. The writing is bad, often overwrought with sappiness and unnecessary capitalization of Important Concepts. The characters are unidimensional and the whole motivation for the boys journey is unconvincing. And it just doesn't work. There were some interesting bits, but not enough to carry the book. If you would like to read some better books of a similar ilk, try \\"Siddhartha\\" by Herman Hesse or the Chinese folk novel \\"Monkey\\".

B000E97HIA|5.0|Mainstream media reviewers have made much ado about Prince's  spiritual bent these days but, I think what they don't get is that he's had it all long just not in the popular sense.<br /><br />  So he doesn't play \\"Darling Nikki\\" live anymore,<br /><br />that doesn't mean he's selling bibles door to door either,<br /><br />  he's just backed off from the vulgar and mautured into the spiritual vibe that had always surrounded his music.<br /><br />  I liked Musicology well enough but 3121 really moves me,<br /><br /> it just seems from start to finish the tunes are open to the interpertation of the listener. The possibilities are endless and that to me, is what makes this album so quintessentially  and classically,<br /><br />  Prince.

0385510454|4.0|Everytime I finish reading a Grisham novel I end up going through withdrawl symptoms and end up ordering another novel.  He is one of the best story tellers I've encountered.  Even though The Broker felt like half history lesson and half information on the Italian lifestyle it was still very interesting.  The novel definetly kept me up at night with me constantly reading.  I just wish the ending would have been more extensive.  Grisham drags on with the history and language of Italy for a good 250 pages before he even starts Marco's escape.  He kind of just ran out of energy at the end of the novel it seemed like.

B000E97HIA|5.0|First off let me say that I am a TRUE fan of Prince and have been since 1979.  I still have \\"Soft and Wet\\" in 45 single version. <br />  I have been with him through the \\"For You\\" and the \\"Controversy\\" years.  I rejoiced with \\"Purple Rain\\" and suffered mild disappointment with \\"Rave Unto The Joy Fantastic.\\" <br />  I am once again rejoicing with \\"3121.\\" <br />  I'll admit, like Musicology\\", it took a couple of listens for me to get a handle on this work, but I am now a firm believer. <br />  I love the title track with it's weird synthetic twists and turns. (I used to live in a crib with the address \\"3121\\"...) <br />  My favorite cuts at this moment are \\"Incense and Candles\\", and \\"Fury\\".  These tunes will become imbedded \\"under your hair\\" as Prince liked to say. <br /> I do think you need to rate the album as a complete work. It flows, man, really flows.  \\"Get On The Boat\\" and \\"The Word\\" are awesome and inspiring. <br />  This album could definitely become the next \\"Purple Rain.\\" <br />OW-OO-AH! <br />
B000BBOUU4|1.0|Am I the only one who believes that this new \\"Charlie\\" film is nothing like the book?  I doubt I'll convert anyone to how I see the story, but if this review counts for anything let it count for this: that there is someone who completely disagrees with the notion that Roald Dahl would have liked this garbage, and that it stays true to the book.   <br />  This new movie doesn't improve the book (it's so good it doesn't need that) nor does it \\"visually\\" capture it, but does it a terrible disservice.   <br />  First, let's talk about the visual aspects. There are reviewers who'll say that this film perfectly captures visually the book.  I like the choke with bitter laughter when I heard that.  What a lie!  EVERYTHING is changed!  Mr. Wonka is not the short delightful little man, with a bright purple velvet jacket, green pants, curly hair, and gottee (like in the book), but in the film, he's a grossly pale face man, with jet-black girly hair, black pants, black shirt, and a violet jacket.   <br />   The Oompa Loompas aren't little children with rosey white faces and golden brown hair (like in the book), but in the film some dark-skinned looking Arabians with tight-skin red suits.  In the book, Willy Wonka and his Oompa Loompas have their act together.  In the book, the Oompa Loompas are obedient and hard workers,each working on fantastic machines for many different candies and purposes.  Everything was neat and in order, not the senseless chaos and mayhem displayed in the film.  In the film, the Oompas Loompas are potrayed as a bunch a silly ugly guys that look like they play video games all day; so many things are going on at once; complete disorder.  Where is that in the book?    <br />  The movie's Chocolate factory and candy machines are way too fancy.  Everything is overwrought.  There's too much machines, too many gizmoes.  None of the visuality of the film came close to my imagination from Roald Dahl's description.   <br />  Secondly, the dialogue.  Sheesh...don't even get me started there! 90% of the dialogue is not from the book! So many lines from Willy Wonka and the children are no where to be found at all in the book.  There's so much darkness added.  I respect the fact that Mr. Burton wanted to make his own version, and wanted it to be different than the original, but I think it's a blatant lie that he was trying to be truer to the book. If he was why not include the ORIGINAL dialogue that is in the book?   <br />  Thirdly, the book gives its morals in a way that is delightful and profound. The Oompa Loompas with their CHILD-LIKE voices and little drums sing there songs all to teach the reader not to make the same mistakes the children make.  In the film, the Oompaas are singing with guitars, discos, saxphones, and all other kind of dreadfully modern day stuff.   <br />  Tim Burton takes the punishments of the children (which they did deserve) and runs thirty yards with it.  In the book, it's done in a funny and profound way. But in the film, the punishments are done as if it was a horror movie.  The squirrels don't just dragged Veruca to the hole, they do it while she's screaming her lungs out, and her fingers are clutching desperately onto the floor, her nails leaving long horrible sratch marks.  Mike Teavee doesn't just get zapped into a T.V. of his own fault, but has to run from side to side as fast as he can while an Oompa Loompa is trying to stab him through with a knife.  Where is that in the book?  The atmosphere of the film as a whole is oppressive, aggressive, and dark.  You feel like your watching a horror film instead of the beloved story by one of the best loved children's authors in the world.  <br />   While watching the film, I really and truly got the impression that Mr. Burton doesn't give a flip about the book or the author's intentions.  When watching the film, I don't see a director who loves and respects the original children's story, but actually who thinks it's corny, and in order to make it better for himself, remakes the story as dark and twisted as possible.   <br />  This IS NOT charlie and the chocolate factory: this is Tim Burton and the Chocolate Factory, folks!
B000ANXLB2|5.0|Thank heavens that the protracted wrangling between DG and Unitel seems to have been amicably resolved and this long-admired set of Beethoven symphony films has reached DVD.  <br />Karajan was arguably at the apex of his conducting career in the late 1960s and early 1970s and this set - laid down between 1967-1972 - captures this gloriously.  <br /> <br />The superbly-honed Berlin Philharmonic respond to their maestro as if one man and Karajan is certainly the embodiment of what the Germans call fingerspitzengefuehl - a combination of experience and intuitive instinct. He had, after all, lived and breathed these peaks of the orchestral repertoire for many years and that knowledge and feel for the works pays off here in spades.  <br /> <br />Karajan's keen interest in film-making is also showcased as he directs symphonies 4, 5 and 9 himself. Other celebrated directors take the helm for the remaining symphonies, including an endlessly fascinating Pastoral from Hugo Niebeling whose arty shots and quirky, psychadelic take could only be a product of the 1960s and which distills an interesting collision between high art and flower power - definitely one to see and one I have returned to time again. A sense of experimentation is also evident - a stunning Eroica has the BPO parcelled-up into inverted triangular segments (ancient Greek theatre is brought to mind) while the glossy floor under Karajan's podium is washed by different colours as the symphony progresses. Some may think it tacky, I found it a refreshing and stimulating visual treat.  <br /> <br />As for the performances themselves Karajan's famous 1962 DG cycle on disc and his follow-up 1976 cycle have long been highly recommendable. And though the Beethoven symphonies were well-established in Karajan's conducting schedule over this period, there is not a whiff of routine here. This filmed cycle blends breathtaking elements of both sound-only cycles - fire and ice, pinpoint precision, gloriously sweeping strings,biting brass and that formidable burnished BPO sound. The DTS soundtrack is truly first class.  <br /> <br />Image quality is also faultless (in spite of the age of the films) as I imagine 35mm film stock was utilised and it has a warmth and clarity that his later Sony Legacy cycle sadly lacked. His latter performances were good but he was longer in the tooth by that stage and the decision to record the cycle with seemingly no audience present robbed those recordings of a certain sense of realism.  <br />Karajan and his Berliners at this time represented the high water mark of orchestral musicianship and anyone who is even slightly interested in either the works or the superb performers will find their outlay repaid a thousandfold. For fans this is, of course, a no-brainer: do not hesitate.  <br /> <br />
B000E97HIA|5.0|Not since his O(+> album back in '92 have I worn out a Prince CD like I have 3121. The more you spin it, the more it infects your mind. Get on the boat and support a real artist.<br /><br />I wish it had more tracks, because this joint is jamm'n!<br /><br />PS - Beck would be the white Prince!  There was Prince way before there was a Beck, shoot Prince had like 16 albums out before Beck even released his first.
B000002IV8|4.0|Well, I've written a lot of Overkill reviews, and I dunno if I have anything new to say.  'I Hear Black' is perhaps there most reviled album, and while it certainly isn't in their upper tier this is still a solid metal album.  I imagine it's largely hurt by the fact that it was preceded by their two best albums.  Though this does mark the end of classic Overkill this is still a thrash album, more or less.  It's got some more groove elements, a seeming Pantera influence, but Overkill has always been good with the groove, and they don't let it get in the way of the rocking too much.  Lotsa people hate this album's production, but I think it's an interesting chang of pace.  'Horrorscope' had some very standard metal production, while \\"I Hear Black' is a bit more unusual, with a fuzzier, more ominous guitar tone and a just generally distant sound making it sound a bit darker.  I really like the thin, snappy drum sound too.<br /><br />As usual, there are no real bad songs here, though it doesn't have as many classics as some of the better Overkill albums.  This album is a bit front-stacked, opening with the three strongest cuts.  'Dreaming in Colombian' is one of the fastest, thrashiest things here but it's still got a cool chorus.  The title track is one of the slower, more atmospheric songs, but it's got some awesome vocals and still plenty of crushing riffs.  'World of Hurt' is probably my favorite track here, just very fun and driving with a solid collection of riffs.  I also particularly like the drumming on this album.  'Weight of the World' is probably the most notable song after this point, and it's just the most pouding piece here, with some really intense drumwork.  I also particularly like the power-ballad 'Shades of Grey'.  Fairly standard stuff, but well executed.<br /><br />Yeah, I like this album.  Not their best one, but still worth owning, just like everything else they've recorded.
B000002AH1|5.0|My vinyl copy of Live/Evil arrived soon after its original release, on my 15th birthday. I had just begun listening seriously to music, and Live/Evil branded itself deep in my brain. \\"Soundtrack of my inner life\\" sounds corny, but that is just what this music has been for my last 35 years. <br /> <br />I have no hesitation calling this rock 'n roll because of its high volume, distortion, and relentless beat. Yet the simple, even crude melodic structures allow the players room to weave and writhe in amazing directions. The band was an improbable collection of eccentrics, yet Miles fused them. Only he could have lead the furious interplay one hears between Keith Jarrett and John McLaughlin, or between Mike Henderson, Jack DeJohnette and Airto Moriera. <br /> <br />There's no missing the angry, aggressive mood of much of the work, yet there's a deep optimism beneath it. I have always felt that Miles wanted not just to lead us to a new kind of music but to a new way of living -- a way that involves asking new questions and passing up old answers. Like so many other early '70s musicians, Miles was trying to shock us with inspiration to create a better world. And I think Live/Evil can still do that in 2006.
B000002MY3|5.0|As you know, this album sold 30 million copies worldwide. Most people purchased the album for the singles, and although the singles You Oughta Know and Ironic rank around the best of the album, there are other really good tracks also.<br /><br />The album begins with the fun rocker \\"All I Really Want\\", it is an informal and immature (not that there's anything wrong with that) song, but doesn't really go anywhere in my opinion, although it does set the tone for the album and Alanis defiantly gets her message across. It was the last single in the UK and peaked at #59 there. \\"You Oughta Know\\" is my favourite song on the album. The album is accessible but also very angry and about many many things, from oral sex to who knows what. It got to #22 in the UK, and #6 in the US. \\"Perfect\\" is an okay song but a great contrast to the other songs on this album. I guess it is about the stereotypical figures that teenagers in particular encounter each day. \\"Hand In My Pocket\\" is another fun song about what Alanis does with her 'other' hand when one is in her pocket. It got to #26 in the UK as the second single and is a very random song indeed.<br /><br />\\"Right Through You\\" is a loud rock song with a loud chorus - which is a great contrast to the moderately quiet verses. There are many electric guitars, and this song is about a guy who Alanis can see right through etc. etc. This is the shortest song from the album. \\"Forgiven\\" is a great song with a very Tori Amos-like subject matter. In fact, this song is very Tori Amos-y. It is the longest song on the album, and one of my favourites. \\"You Learn\\" was one of the four songs I had heard before purchasing this album (others were tracks 2, 8, and 10). It is a great adult pop song, and is another contrast from the anger of the other tracks. This song peaked at #24 in the UK, and #4 in the US (the 'main' a-side to the US single, with Ironic). \\"Head Over Feet\\" follows and is a nice song, and the most successful single in the UK (the only one to go top 10 - #7), and was the fifth single there. It is the most accessible / radio-friendly song from here.<br /><br />\\"Mary Jane\\" is another of my favourites. It is composed in 3/4 and is a very beautiful and peaceful song. \\"Ironic\\" follows, and is nothing less than a pop masterpiece. It starts out so folksy, and then turns into a masterpiece of the pop song that it is. It peaked at #11 in the UK, and #4 in the US, and is a song that everyone can relate to. Many of the tracks on this album use the quiet verses / loud choruses formula, and this song is no exception, with the question, did Alanis even know what irony meant? \\"Not The Doctor\\", track eleven, also uses this formula and is another of my favourites. It is a serious and abstract song and each chorus is louder than the last. The album closes with the brilliant (understatement) \\"Wake Up\\". Although this song is very accessible, it is still great and maybe could have been released as a single in place of \\"All I Really Want\\"<br /><br />This is my first and only Alanis album, but do look forward to purchasing more. As you probably don't know, and album has to be an absolute masterpiece for me to give it a 10 (see my other reviews if you have time), so I will unfortunately not be giving it one. But who can complain over a 9 and a half?<br /><br />9.5 / 10- #7), and was the fifth single there. It is the most accessible / radio-friendly song from here.    \\"Mary Jane\\" is another of my favourites.

B000002WPI|5.0|In 1993 Westcoast rap dominated the hit lists, with Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Ice Cube in the front. This was about to change pretty soon. 9 rappers from Staten Island and Brooklyn started on a musical revolution that summer with the two bangers \\"Protect Ya Neck\\" and \\"Method Man\\", and a couple of months later we got an album that where so hard and mind-blowing, that nobody had heard before, not then, not afterwards. <br /> <br />Today about every song on this record is marked with the word classic on it. The whole kung fu gimmick where genius and contributed to create something different, and gave the album a mystic feel. I assume this record worked as aggression therapy for frustrated teenagers, songs like \\"Bring Da Ruckus\\" and \\"Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthin' To F' Wit\\" are extremely hard, and that's what people wanted. There where a lot of great spittin' here, not surprising since nine rappers fought for mictime, and the production was pure illness. \\"Tearz\\" (which where they first indie-single) are one of my absolute favourites, featuring a great Wendy Rene vocal-sample. And who can forget \\"C.R.E.A.M.\\"? Raekwon and Deck's verses are still pumpin' through my brains. <br /> <br />In '93 it was time for eastcoast-rap, and RZA and the rest of clan excepted the challenge with open arms. It's often those who gives a f', that manages to create something new. On Enter The Wu-Tang there's no convention, they where just creative, and when it comes to all, that's what hip-hop is about, right? Don't sleep on it. <br />
B000000OQY|4.0|GN'R Lies is the second album that Guns N' Roses released.  For some reason, it does not get all that much attention from the general public, even though it is a decent album (albeit a very short one) and it has one of their greatest songs (\\"Patience\\").    The first half of the album actually predates the \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" material.  These are fun, hard-rocking songs done in classic 1980's \\"hair band\\" style.  The second half was their fresh material, and is pretty much acoustic rock.    The highlights are the original \\"You're Crazy,\\" the controversial \\"One in a Million,\\" and, of course \\"Patience.\\"  Also, the album cover has some interesting pictures and commentary.    I would suggest \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" and perhaps \\"Use Your Illusion I\\" first, but this is definitely worth a listen, especially for Guns N' Roses and classic rock fans.
B0000501C3|5.0|Great recording, Great Music.......It has music written by Lully's father in-law as well. You should 1st watch the DVD and listen to this CD!
B000E33VWW|5.0|Oh! The long-awaited film based on the biography of one of the best American authors to ever have lived. And who doesn't love an independent film? With Phillip Seymor Hoffman, one of the most overlooked actors of our time, and Catherine Keenor, wasn't she in 40-Year-Old Virgin? Sometimes a secured Oscar is enjoyed more than a barnburner. <br /> If you have, or haven't, seen Capote then please read some of his masterpieces. In Cold Blood is probably one of the best Non-Fiction pieces ever written. Breakfast at Tiffany's will make you wish he would have written a sequel. And don't forget to pay due attention to his less famous short stories. Truman Capote led a very interesting life that is worth much attention and study. This is a film that must be seen and admired by many.
B000001ESF|5.0|Neil Peart has some of his best percussion work on the title track.  To this day I can amaze people by playing passages of his drumming on '2112'.  The music making up this long piece is excellent.  It's a great futuristic storyline that's a lot of fun for the listener.<br /><br />The band handles this early musical challenge well.  It's still hard to believe Rush is just made up of 3 guys.<br /><br />As excellent as the '2112' opus turned out to be the other songs are the real treat here.  'Twilight Zone' might seem like a throwaway but Geddy Lee takes the straightforward lyrics and creates a creepy atmosphere that almost puts the listener into one of the old episodes of the 'Twilight Zone'.  'A Passage To Bangkok' remains one of my favorite Rush songs.  The other songs are just as good.<br /><br />2112 is an early musical tour de force and remains a favorite of their fans to this day.  Unfortunately, you can't just have one Rush cd.  You'll need to pick up Hemispheres, A Farewell to Kings, and Permanent Waves along with 2112.  That's a lot of Rush to buy but you'll be glad you did.
B00097A5I6|5.0|I will have to say that I was sceptical of the new band, but I do truly Love this album. I went to the concert in Nashville on 3/26/2006, and the show was magnificent. I really beleive that the new band works well together. The best song on this album is LYLA by far, but Your love's like a bomb would be my next favorite. I would recommend this album to any hardcore Oasis fan.
1400062071|5.0|I loved every page of Strout's Amy and Isabelle and have been eagerly awaiting her second novel with high expectations.  Abide with Me exceeded these expectations with its beautiful description and wonderfully developed characters.  I could not put this book down, and found myself rereading it within 24 hours. <br />Strout's prose is in a league of its own-she stands apart from her peers in tone, description, and humor.  You will not walk away from this novel untouched.  <br />I highly recommend this novel.  <br />
B000000P17|3.0|This Is NOT a \\"BAD\\" album, But even as a huge Guns N' Roses fan, I can't call this a \\"GREAT\\" Album and it is an Unfortunate way to end the legacy of \\"THE GREATEST SEX, DRUGS, & ROCK & ROLL BAND OF ALL TIME\\" So when I see other reviewers calling this album \\"Strange\\" or \\"Odd\\" I feel it is important to mention that THE SPAGHETTI INCIDENT? is not what it started out to be,  S.I.? was initially intended to be a stop-gap release of a FEW Punk Covers.  This Punk [EP] was meant to be released during the long period between LIES & The USE YOUR ILLUSION album.  Jamming on some of their favorite Punk songs was supposed to be a way for the band to get focused before diving into NEW songs.  It worked (perhaps Too well).  The Band ended up with so many ideas & songs that Use Your Illusion Became 2 Albums & the [EP] was shelved only to re-emerge after the U.Y.I albums as a Full-length [LP]. <br /> <br />I think THE SPAGHETTI INCIDENT? would have done much better & been better received, if it had been released as intended. As a Fun [EP] to wet our destructive appetites, And it would have been cooler if GNR had left on the much grander note of their ILLUSION epics than a comparatively  weak cover album, but who am I to complain about MORE songs...  especially now that GNR is gone  <br /> <br />But If your New to Guns N' Roses, I recommend  <br /> <br />GNR's GREATEST HITS: <br />(If you like the songs you may have heard on the  radio or seen on MTV)  <br /> <br />or  <br /> <br />APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION  <br />one of the best hard rock albums of   all time, & one of the few from the 80's that hasn't become a joke) <br /> <br />...& I know GNR isn't gone but I consider what Axl is doing a completely different animal        <br /> <br />  ....................................CHINESE DEMOCRACY NOW!!!
0380799006|5.0|What a superb book! I didn't think I'd ever find a way to keep my 2- and 3-year old children from bickering, throwing toys at each other, and whining. I always despaired that my son (the firstborn) had a powerful and intense personality, whereas his younger sister was shy and timid, and couldn't stand up for herself. After reading this book, I realized the importance of staying away from labels like \\"intense\\" and \\"shy\\", and that put me off to a great start! I quickly learned that, given the chance, my \\"shy and timid\\" daughter had every ability to defend herself. I've been using the techniques in this book for less than a week and I'm already seeing a very noticable difference in my children's behavior.  <br /> <br />Here are some specific reasons why I recommend this book: <br /> <br />* EASY TO UNDERSTAND <br />Each chapter comes with a series of \\"comics\\" designed to reinforce the lessons given. Seeing the tactics used in real situations helped me see exactly how to use the tactics, and why they worked. <br /> <br />* EMPATHETIC TO THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN <br />I have never read a parenting book that is so in-tune to the needs of children without spoiling them. By helping me see things from a child's point of view, Adele Faber illustrates many important points (such as why labeling children can be very harmful). <br /> <br />* RICH WITH EXAMPLES <br />Adele Faber wrote this book based on a parenting course she taught. She uses real-life examples and describes how her techniques worked for many different kinds of families (e.g. parents of three teenaged girls, parents of a newborn and a preschooler, etc.).
B000750OEA|4.0|A fairly complete history of Kylie Ann's career. This DVD covers EVERY VIDEO that matters from her origin as an artist; the SAW years (Stock, Aiken and Waterman productions), the radio-pop years, the disco years and the ultimate smashing success of the \\"Fever\\" CD and it concludes with her most recent R&B/Soul music videos. It shows her entire evolution. From squeaky clean cutie to blazing hot seductress. As a bonus there is a nice live performance at the Brit Awards on here. I only wish there could have been more bonus footage, but all and all there's 30 videos on here and in pretty much chronological order. Accurate color, clear picture and digital stereophonic sound throughout. NOT TOO SHABBY an awesome value.
B000AP04NI|3.0|The Region 2 DVD has just been released in the UK and yes, the TODD-AO version is inferior. However, with a little tweaking of the TV (we use the PAL system) it's not unwatchable. After the initial disappointment I still prefer it to the CinemaScope version. In the UK/European release, Fox have included a sort of apology before the Opening Titles, claiming that the 70mm Master used was the best available element to them and that the restoration is the best currently achievable. If this did not appear on the Region 1 release then perhaps Fox have got the message.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|This is probably the best cd ive herd from rob zombie. dont get me wrong i love his old music but as a whole this is his best cd.
B000ENWKN8|4.0|This album actually has better production than Sinister Urge. Whats interesting is that I hear a lot more of Alice Cooper early 2000 era on this album. On American Witch, the intro pretty much has the identical flow of the intro of Alice Cooper's Brutal Planet. The Scorpions Sleeps sounds like something that could've came off of AC's Dragontown album. Bleed It Out sounds like typical upbeat Rob Zombie music. Foxy Foxy still sounds like something Alice Cooper would've done. <br /> <br />I like the addition of John 5 to this band. I was actually surprised to hear a solo on Bleed It Out. <br /> <br />The album altogether sounds OK but nowhere as good as Astro Creep or Hillybilly Deluxe.
0736041850|5.0|This is not only an excellent anatomy book for strength training, it also has good guidelines for performing exercises correctly and tips for getting more out of each movement.  It goes beyond most similar books in detail and the diagrams are great without being overly complicated.<br /><br />While the book doesn't talk about how to put together workouts or routines for various body parts, it delivers on its title.  If you want specific workouts collected in book form, this isn't what you are looking for.  However, for strength training anatomy, it's simple, straightforward and well done in every respect.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|I will admit at first I was a little confused by the sound of this album and I have been a fan of Rob for years. After listening through I began to realize this is a masterpiece of an album. I realized that I was taken back because of what Rob's sound evolved into from his White Zombie days. Instead of being pure hard rock he had turned into near industrial metal. This album takes both the new Zombie and old and mixes it into one. Think of White Zombie's La Sexorcisto album from 92 mixed with a little of the modern Zombie sound and you have Educated Horses. Rob Zombie goes back to his hard rock roots and delivers in my opinion his most mature and entertaining solo album yet. No that doesn't mean I don't like Hellbilly Deluxe or Sinister Urge. It's just I prefer the real Hard Rock sound to the industrial sound. Great job Rob!! Keep up the great work, I am never disappointed by the work of the great Zombie!
1573225517|4.0|Normally if I like the movie, I am eager to read the book as it is almost always better.  Yet I have recently encountered a couple of examples to the contrary and was therefore a bit apprehensive as to whether HIGH FIDELITY would continue with that unfortunate trend.  Glad to say that the spell has been broken.  Indeed, I laughed out loud on several occasions.    We are taken into Rob's inner world as he ruminates over the recent loss of his girlfriend Laura, who has run off with the upstairs neighbor whose sexual staying power, based upon what they heard through their ceiling, seems to be akin to that of one of the better established male porn stars.  Combined with Rob's doubts about what he has accomplished in his life, his interactions with his employees at the record store and his quick affairs with pretty American musical singers all makes HIGH FIDELITY as enjoyable a read as it is a quick one.    As I myself am also a single male in my upper thirties, perhaps I was able to appreciate this book more than others.  I cannot say for sure.  I can say that Hornby's observations about his characters are spot on and at times a bit too close for comfort.  That such an accurate portrait is created in such a lighthearted and funny book is a testament to Hornby's talent.
B000E97HIA|5.0|This album just shows how versatile Prince still is and that the brother still has it! The song 'The Word'...so heavy. Buy this album and support real musicianship. We love you Prince!
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|THIS ALBUM ISN'T UR TYPICAL HIP HOP DISC THIS OPUS IS ONE OF THOSE JOINTS THAT COME AROUND EVERY COUPLE TIMES.
0812580346|3.0|Like Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat, Flashforward is a confounding, challenging, magnificent thought experiment that is, at once, breathtakingly simply and yet staggering in its possible scope and ramifications.<br /><br />Lloyd Simcoe and Theo Procopides (a pair of brilliant Canadian particle physicists ... hip, hip hooray!) are hot on the trail of the elusive Higgs Boson and the Nobel Prize that would almost certainly follow in the wake of success. To say that their experimental set up at CERN, Switzerland's Large Hadron Collider, producing over eleven hundred and fifty trillion electron volts - energy levels that haven't been seen since less than one billionth of a second after the Big Bang - went off the rails is an understatement of epic proportions. In fact, the experiment resulted in a complete shut down of humanity's collective consciousness and every single person in the world, awake or asleep, experienced a full two minute blackout. But what they also saw was, apparently, a crystal clear vision of a two minute segment of their own future twenty years ahead.<br /><br />As people blackout for two minutes, the immediate mayhem and destruction is almost beyond imagining - car crashes, botched surgeries, people falling down stairs and off ladders, burns as people collapse into their hot stoves, planes falling out of the sky, fires as people drop the lit matches that happened to be in their hands. But, as the dust of the immediate disaster settles, the magnitude of what happened sinks in and people begin to coordinate their two minute peeks into a consolidated vision of the world's future twenty years hence. Sawyer's fertile imagination simply runs riot as he presents us a with a humorous, lucid and very personal peek into his version of how the world might look twenty years from now. I howled with laughter; I nodded in agreement and I cringed in disagreement and dismay at some of the snippets he hypothesized.<br /><br />Take a gander at just a few examples:<br /><br />\\"In 2017, at the age of ninety-one, Elizabeth II, Queen of England, died. Charles, her son, at that time sixty-nine, was mad as a loon, and, with some prodding from his advisors, chose not to ascend to the throne. William, Charles' eldest son, next in line, shocked the world by renouncing the throne, leading Parliament to declare the Monarchy dissolved.\\"<br /><br />\\"In 2019, South Africa completed, at long last, its post-Apartheid crimes-against-humanity trials, with over five thousand people convicted. President Desmond Tutu, eighty-eight, pardoned them all, an act, he said, not just of Christian forgiveness but of closure.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ozone depletion was substantial; people wore hats and sunglasses, even on cloudy days.\\"<br /><br />\\"Despite bans on their hunting, sperm whales were extinct by 2030.\\"<br /><br />\\"George Lucas still hadn't finished his nine-part Star Wars epic.\\"<br /><br />\\"The 2029 World Series will be won by the Honolulu Volcanoes.\\"<br /><br />\\"The President of the United States was African-American and male; there had apparently yet to be a female American president in the interim. But the Catholic Church did indeed now ordain women.\\"<br /><br />As people ponder the ramifications of what they've seen and experienced, the world becomes a global forum for a heated debate on the issues of determinism, free will and destiny. Social pressure quickly builds for a repeat of the experiment under world-wide controlled conditions and Sawyer treats us to a realistic, shocking example of cultures clashing in the forum of the United Nations.<br /><br />Sadly, it's been my experience with Sawyer's novels, and this one doesn't break the pattern, that he has difficulty resolving a plot line and providing a satisfactory ending that is up to the incredibly high standard set by the rest of the novel. In a problem that is reminiscent of Hybrids, the ending to Flashforward, while it might be perceived as thought provoking to some people, is just a little bit too overthe top Hollywood and, in my opinion, reduces a potentially great novel to a good one.<br /><br />Keep `em coming, Robert. I'm a fan and I'm still looking forward to the next one!<br /><br />Paul Weissem coming, Robert. I'm a fan and I'm still looking forward to the next one!    Paul Weiss
B00069YE0W|5.0|For anyone who can appreciate warmth in music, this album is for them. The guy who wrote that really crappy review was obviously an idiot. I mean, music is a matter of personal taste and everyone is entitled to their opinion, but if you don't like it then why come on here and write a really harsh review? You're clearly a struggling human who can't deal with genius when faced with it. go back to your fu**ed up musical ideal and your 'raw' performances. raw is a word. music is emotion and you clearly lack that. stop being such a synical f**k-witt. try and feel something for once instead of judging people and their own personal efforts at beauty. if i heard u'r music i may not like it. but i'd still commend you for your efforts at making a beautiful piece of art... something that you and others really appreciate. the bottom line is... critics are useless, they serve no purpose. they do nothing for everybody and you are doing just that. go and listen to what makes you happy and stay there quietly. you don't deserve to have a musical opinion if you can't appreciate all kinds of music.
B00005JO1R|5.0|This is an all around great movie. It's well directed, well shot, and well written. It's brilliantly acted and very entertaining. Reese absolutely deserved the Oscar. And If Phyllip Seymore Hoffman had not made \\"Capote\\" this year, Joaquin certainly would have walked away with the Oscar. I feel it's a travesty that this film wasn't even nominated for best picture. I guess the Acadamy didn't want back to back musical biography movies.   Anyway, this is a must see for any fan of Johnny Cash, Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, or anyone who likes great movies.
0060922583|4.0|This book is well written, however there are somethings i don't like about this book. The book does give VERY good information that gets the reader to think pretty deep. However, after the first 80 or so pages, it gets somewhat off topic i think. It goes on through out the rest of the book about how this holographic view can be used to describe a bunch of mystical things that have happened throughout history.  While it is a cool topic to talk about, some of the stories seem kind of unrealistic. If even half of the stories in this book ARE true however, this would make for an amazingly complicated and fantastic world.  Would i recommend this book? If you like to read this kind of stuff (like i do) i would say yes!  Besides... it's paperback and so it doesn't cost much to give it a try! :)
B000E33VWW|5.0|This is a well done and entertaining movie, but as one reviewer said \\"It's worth seeing for Hoffmans performance alone\\". That is true! He absolutely deserved the oscar. If you want to see some other movies that Philip could have been nominated for. Check out \\"Love Liza\\", \\"Owning Mahony\\", and \\"Flawless\\". He's also very good in \\"Happiness\\" but that movie is not for everyone!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I liked this adaptation very much and have watched the dvd more times than I would care to admit..especially as I am in my late 40's!  Matthew Macfadyen is so compelling to watch..his facial expressions and body language spoke volumes.  Keira Knightley is a very good actress but there were occasions in the movie I felt she over-acted. <br />The scenery, the subtle humour, and Matthew Macfadyen :) made this movie eminently watchable!!!
0064407667|4.0|\\"The Bad Beginning\\" is one of the only books I can truly say that I `couldn't put down.'  A short volume with a very flowing and easily read narration makes this book a very enjoyable read. <br /> <br />The writing of this book is absolutely marvelous.  Within the first few pages, you have a good grasp of (and know perhaps all you nee to know about) the three protagonists.  The antagonist, the vile Count Olaf, is well described and certainly detestable.  Points in the story make you laugh out loud, but not due to the plot, due to the hilarious manner in which the story is written in.  It is told as if someone is sitting in front of a fireplace on a cushioned arm-chair, telling the tale to you and humorously describing the meaning of words you may not understand that are used in the story. <br /> <br />Characters that you grow to love are put in a seemingly hopeless situation and though the ending is a bit silly, Lemony Snicket definitely makes it work.  I'm not going to spoil it, however, so I will say no more other then \\"get this book.\\" <br /> <br />Get this book! <br /> <br />PS: There is a particularly funny part that was stupendously written, when the Baudelaire boy is reading a book while he is trying to not go to sleep.  Look for this part!  It's amazingly creative! <br />
B000002U9W|2.0|Though only a few diehards will agree with me, Pink Floyd took a creative nosedive once Syd left the band. Ummagumma had a few interesting lysergic diversions and Meddle has its momemts but Atom Heart Mother is a dyed in the wool \\"concept album\\" that goes nowhere. Unfortunately, Pink Floyd were finding their sound which they would hit with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" at which point they had absolutely nothing in common with the beginnings of the band and skyrocketed in the \\"top 40\\" category. Every trapping of prog rock pretension in manifest on this album, the brass instrument back up, the piano diversion, the pseudo Freudian bizzare titles (\\"Father's Shout\\"). Its not fair to say that punks hated Pink Floyd. They just had legitimate grievances against what it became. Many psych-punk bands have lionized and covered everything Syd. Its not that Atom Heart Mother is really so terrible. Its just once David Gilmour set the controls for the heart of the band, they were not the same creative visionaries that Syd, without his issues that caused him to leave the band could have made them.
0446577383|2.0|The first half of the book seems kind of flat and he appears to telegraph the plot line, i.e. typical terrorist take over. However some of the characters do come thru with interesting hidden backgrounds, that prove vital to their survival. Again, in a somewhat tyipcal fashion and \\"won't talk about it\\" etc. Taking all that into account is was not bad but I will not be saving it to read  again in the future.
B000E97Y6A|3.0|Initially, I was a little disappointed in this movie. I have changed my mind as I have seen this now several times and each time I pick up something new I missed. Thus, I enjoy each viewing and my opinion of this movie has improved over time. Though I believe the original movie is better, I still highly recommend buying this movie. There are many parts that were very well done and I feel it well worth the cost of having this version too.    I assign a VG to this version of King Kong. (I assigned a VG++ to the original version.)    Just the idea of the story - lost island, prehistoric monsters, extensive jungle scenes, ancient ruins and temples, horrendous statues of great antiquity - this is enough to send me desperately searching for that movie or story. Yet plot is important too. Why are the characters there to begin with - are they lost?, searching for somehting? why?      In this current version of King Kong, by Peter Jackson, I believe that the casting could have been better. It was ok. Carl Denham in the original movie was basically a good person. He came across as a sincere, energetic movie director, but one who was likely to take too many chances with the safety of the people he worked with. In the Jackson version, he came across as a liar, mean-spirited person, who just used people. I prefer the original Carl Denham.    I have mixed feeling about having the supposed writer, Driscol, along. He became the love interest for Ann Darrow, rather than the First Mate, as happens in the original version. This was probably done because it made more sense that Ann would develop a sincere relationship with someone nearer to her work interests, than some sea-going mate, who may or may not hold down a job in the same place where Ann could. So for this reason alone, I think the role was fine. My only complaint is how he gets stuck on this voyage to begin with. Why didn't he go directly to the captain and ask to be let off the ship? According to the original movie, tugs controlled the ship in harbor, releasing once the ship was safely away and able to steer on its own. It is hard for me to imagine Driscol not being able to get back to shore, if he truly wanted to.    I initially thoroughly disliked the presence of the guy playing the role of the \\"big-time movie star\\" being aboard. What made me change my mind is how he eventually becomes a 'hero' of sorts, rather than some dandy who thinks he is a hero and turns into what he really is, a coward. This character development was done just fine, and I sort of liked him at that point. In addition, he provides some laughs and did not take himself seriously either. He earned my respect and I felt he added to the plot.    I liked the tramp steamer captain the most of all the characters - Englehorn - from the start. His role was very good. He was consistent, for he maintained the \\"ideal\\" view of captain in my mind. He was someone to depend upon who would come to your aid, even though you might be foolish with risking your own life and those of everyone else associated with you as Denham did. He had authority, but he did not abuse it. Instead, he used this to help his crew consistently, and helped his passengers, Like Denham, who did not really deserve help.      The Ann Darrow part was done very well too. Initially, I did not care for the part in which she dances for King Kong. However, in time I came to accept and enjoy how the relationship evolved. I could not make any suggestion to improve the approach taken to show this development. What I have come to accept is how their relationship does eventually grow, it does become \\"interesting\\", and that feeling of loss and tragedy that was so poignant in the original was even more present in this film. It was definitely there and I felt that tragic loss of Kong even more in the Jackson version. This is due certainly to the excellent acting of Ann.    The build-up of this movie was fine. I enjoyed the ocean voyage, the expectancy of getting to SkullIsland grew and developed well with me, but not as strongly as the original film. This was all fine. Then came the islanders themselves - like being stranded on an island with a bunch of evil, drugged idiots. They all looked like they were on crack, stoned on some bingo-juice, and, is short, they appeared more like a bunch of stupid idiots than dangerous natives. I thought this part could have been improved upon. How did these people survive this island, since they all looked diseased, for heaven's sake. Then the wall, yes the wall was dumb. Compared to the original movie, this wall was a sieve that couldn't keep water out, let alone  anything like a charging Kong. This was a big disappointment to the huge build up that occurred to this point of the movie. I did not care for the natives, nor the \\"wall\\" at all. The original has this beat by far. The overall scenery was great and had more than the eye can take in with one viewing.       In addition, the dinosaurs were the biggest disappointment to me. These encounters left a lot to be desired. I did not want a magical Disney tour of a theme park approach as was done in this movie. The stampeding brontosaurs was nonsensical, to say the least. The sailors would have been destroyed by any stampeding brontosaursi as they were all running together down that \\"alley\\". No way anyone would have survived such an event. This was insane, to put it mildly. Then I ask myself why did they stampede to begin with? It was likely due to the presence of raptors, I guessed from what I observed. Generally, I would have expected the brontosaur to be capable of crushing attacking raptors by using its tail to send one to the moon, stomping on one with it monstrous legs, etc. So the stampede of a herd of massive reptiles in the face of pigmy attackers, as presented in the movie, mountains of massive flesh fleeing from the itty bitty attackers, was far fetched and just not believable to me. And it appeared as if this attack wiped out this branch of dinosaurs on the island since so many fell either off the cliff face or were involed in that massive car-wreck of a mess when machine guns took down the front running dinosaur with the raptors too. I think this could have been a little better done.    Then the T-Rex. What a disppointment! In the original version of King Kong, I always wondered what would have happened if Kong met with one of these actual monsters. In the original version, he fought, what appeared to be, a toothless, tired, old T-Rex. What about Kong fighting a 10 ton, charging beast with teeth 8-10 inches long, and having massive jaws capable of ripping many pounds of flesh per bite. This sort of beast attacking him might lead to a different outcome entirely, and this would be enormous interest to this movie, if done properly. I do not think a real Kong could survive such an attack without some terrible wounds of his own. I always felt this would have been one horrendous battle. Something for the ages, to be remembered for all time. Yet this movie turned that battle into a quick down and out joke. Kong made happy meals out of three - yes, 3 - T-Rexes. Impossible! Stupid! Idiotic! I hated that part, even though I watched it with interest. I got bored with it once I saw how quickly Kong was dispatching not one but 3 of the fiercest land predators that ever lived. These beast weighed over 10 tons, for heaven's sake, not a few hundred pounds. Yet Kong tossed them around. Not possible. Then I asked myself, would Kong so easily have dispatched a charging Triceratops? I bet they would have made a comedy of that one too. And again, how about a sabertooth? Such a nightmarish, horrendous predator would have been a challenge to a charging Mastrodon, and I bet could have ripped parts of Kong to pieces, if it ever got onto his back or even got hold of his arm. It would have been impossible for Kong to fight such a creature without shedding some blood too. Yet, I bet this too would have been a one-two punchand out for the producers of this movie. Hence, I lost interest in this entire section with T-Rex.      What would I have done? Yes, Kong has to live to end up in New York to finish this film. So he would win the battle, but not before he had some rents and tears in his own hide from the incredibly fast jaws of an attacking T-Rex. It might have been close to a take-down on the part of T-Rex, if I had my way. No way would I have made this battle into a comedy.     Then the island itself. What a nightmare world it was. A fascinating, lost world to end all lost world stories. Yet, the island seemed confined, with alleys for the dinosaurs to traverse, not spooky jungles, and it was too mountainous for my tastes. Have mountains, yes, but not dominating the scenery throughout as was done in this movie.    In conclusion, I gave this movie a VG, or 4 stars. If the inslanders did not look completely stoned on crack, and if the dinosaurs were truer dinosaurs, and if the battle between Kong and the T-Rex was an epic battle, then this movie would have gotten a higher rating from me. The Original movie, I gave a VG++. It was not beaten by this new version for consistent mood, for keeping my interest intense, for believable acting, and for flow of story.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Really beautiful \\"Movie\\" that will make you forget the time, bring up your tears , break your heart, and teach you \\"something\\". It's really worth seeing \\"Movie\\"
B00005JO9J|5.0|I started watching the second season on tv but never saw how the show got started so I bought the first season.  I watched all episodes in one day.  I could not stop watching it because I was caught up in the story line. Grey's Anatomy is a great series to watch.  I love to watch E.R. but I love Grey's Anatomy even better.
B0000028RR|5.0|I never liked these guys when I was a kid. \\"Why is this guy yelling so much?\\" Of course, I was too young to comprehend the politics that did indeed give Zack de la Rocha a right to scream. And I was to young to appreciate the funky bass of Tim Commerford, the solid drumming of Brad Wilk, and, of course, Tom Morello's guitar work, which was both heavy and innovative. I bought this album on a whim after hearing Killing in the Name on the radio. And what a purchase it turned out to be. This album is chock full of heavy riffs, funky bass, and angry, tortured left-winged screams.    For most of my reviews, I give a track-by-track breakdown. However, I am not going to do that for this album, simply because A. Only one song on here would have recieved less than a 9/10 (Fistful of Steel gets a 7.5), and B. You will either like this album or dislike it. Very rarely will someone love Take the Power Back and hate Know Your Enemy, and most of the tracks could be inserted for said songs and the statement would remain true (the one exception could be Killing in the Name, which I could imagine non-Rage fans liking, but hating the rest of the album). This is not a collection of 10 angry songs, this is entire angry album, so it will be hit or miss with most people. And make no mistake, this is not an album for everyone. If you absolutely cannot accept the amount of liberalism in the lyrics, this is not for you (You do NOT have to completely agree with them, but you must be able to at least temporarily see things from Zack's point of view to enjoy this album). However, if you can handle the point-of-view and are into agit-prop, you MUST pick up this album. You will be greatly rewarded.
B00005RG6B|3.0|Operation Mindcrime is the only Queensryche album that I own, bought due to a fondness for concept albums, and I consider it to be an absolute masterpiece. It has an extremely coherent plot combined with great individual songs that fit together to make an album that flows seamlessly. <br /> <br />I knew nothing about Queensryche before buying this, not even what they looked like, and I found this DVD to be a bit of a letdown. It is typical overblown 90's arena rock in the worst way. From the sly wink at the camera mid-guitar solo, to the Kevin Keegan-style permed mullet of the bassist, the constant phallic gestures with the guitars, the dodgy leather outfits, the spinning round on the spot by the guitarists and bassist, there's just something a little embarrassing about watching it.  <br /> <br />Technically the music is flawless, although on a few occasions the singer fails to hit the high notes, or tries to vary the vocal delivery by speaking certain phrases syncopated to the music, which doesn't really work. This is the only allowed deviation from the original though, and the performance is almost note for note what is on the album.  <br /> <br />Personally, I would much rather listen to the album than sit down and watch this. With the album you can concentrate on the music and the storyline, but here too much of your attention is taken up by cringing at the band, and this tends to detract from the experience, despite the excellent songs and the undeniable quality of musicianship. <br /> <br />It's difficult to give this anything other than a fairly neutral 3 stars. If you like Operation Mindcrime then you certainly will not hate this, but in my opinion it is far from essential.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Admittedly, I did not have high hopes for this moving knowing that it would be hard to do in 2 hours what A&E did in 5+ hours.  But,  I had thought it would have been better--Emma and Sense and Sensibility were much better shortened Hollywood versions of Austen's books than this was.      So what did I find wrong with this adaptation?  1.  The Bennets looked sloppy and poor.  I immediately thought back to two lines from the book that made me think that this was not how the Bennet's should have appeared:  Jane tells Lizzy \\"We're not very poor.\\" and Lizzy telling Lady Catherine \\"He is a gentleman and I am a gentleman's daughter, so far we are equal.\\"  I felt that the Bennet's looked just a little better than the orphans in Oliver Twist.      2.  Mr. Bennett was portrayed as a grumpy old man.  One thing I  loved about Pride and Predjudice was Austen's humor and Mr. Bennett had in my opinion some of her best lines.  These were totally lacking in this movie and didn't need to be--why change his character completely?  True, he did redeem himself a little in the end and I loved the line about sending in any beau's that may call for Kitty and Mary.\\"        3.  At the movie's beginning, Lizzy seemed to have a chip on her shoulder and hated Darcy from the moment he walked in the door.  I couldn't account for that.  She felt at liberty to make biting comments to him before she ever overheard his critical comment of her.  She really irritated me from the beginning and it was hard to get past that to enjoy the rest of the movie.    4.  Mr.  Bingley appeared as a bumbling imbesole instead of a humble and likeable gentleman and I agree with one writer that the actress who played Jane would have made a better Elizabeth.  Jane seemed to have more wits about her than Lizzy.   Kitty and Lydia and sometimes Lizzy seemed to giggle for no reason.  I found them irritating as well. Georgiana Darcy's character was also altered.  The book describes her as being very shy as to appear a snob but that is not so.  This Georgiana was not a bit shy.    Overall, I felt that the end of the film was better than the beginning, but I still would never buy or recommend this movie.  I wondered if I would have liked it better having known nothing of the book.  I would have preferred much more of the story cut out to develop the overall love story between Elizabeth and Darcy and give certain characters more presence.     I know that my reviews will probably be unpopular, since others who have rated this movie poorly have recieved ratings to reflect that, but to be honest, I find it hard to find many things I liked about this version.      I'll stick to the A&E version.

B000ASATWQ|2.0|well, i thought i would be up for a big surprise with this album but i just wanna say that someone who's last name's Marley, son of the King, really spoiled it up by trying to make something that could somehow distinct him from his father...Distinction from Bob Marley??? C'mon Damian...i respect the freedom that everybody thinks they should have in all matters, but trying to prove your worth by spoiling reggae and living up to OUR father's reputation? you are the one who should be doing something much more profound and valuable, continuing Bob's neverending faith and dream! i just can't get it... The only two songs i dig in this album are \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\" (awesome bass), and \\" Road to Zion\\", i can't appreciate any other songs. And by the way, your live show has no vibe, besides the covers of Bob, which you also ruined with those ragga jams at the middle. <br />Not for any true reggae fan, sorry

B00005JOFQ|4.0|The unfocused, teary stares of each of them, especially Health Ledger (Ennis Del Mar), is so familiar to anyone who has yearned for a loved one out of reach. As a recent widow I could relate in my grief to those stares and found camaderie and comfort. The story is universal. It shouldn't matter who the players are. We are souls who love.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|Because Peter Jackson is such a fan of KING KONG '33, his 2005 remake is tough to separate from the original.  And because I know the old film very well, it's tough for me, too. <br />      <br />     To begin with, I feel that Jackson's KONG is too long.  If it were up to me, I would cut about 45 minutes out of it easily.  However, the special effects are (mostly) great, though I feel that JURASSIC PARK (1993) is still better in this regard. <br />      <br />     I think the effects depicting Kong himself are very well done.  Kong as a character is well conceived here, too, with some silver hair and battle scars.  Given these positives, it's a shame that, for me, a lot of the film doesn't live up to them. <br />      <br />     *WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!* <br />      <br />     Jackson opens the film with titles in the '33 style, then does a 1930's montage (Hoovervilles, bread lines, etc.) to educate today's audience about the period; these are flawless recreations, but go on too long for me.  He then introduces Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts--good in the role) as a struggling actress.   <br />      <br />     Filmmaker Carl Denham is later introduced as a ne'er-do-well con-artist in the Orson Welles mold (put six inches and a cheesy moustache on Jack Black--good in the part, BTW--and he'd be a ringer for Welles, c. 1942).  Always on the make, he meets Ann as she contemplates employment at a strip joint, and sets sail on The Venture for parts unknown (Skull Island) before he can be arrested for absconding with studio funds.  Trapped on board is Jack Driscoll (Adrian Brody), in this version a playwright and reluctant Denham partner (Brody is not bad in the part, but I feel he's not given much of a character to work with). <br />      <br />     The Venture's Captain Englehorn is a 40-ish, shady German; his first-mate is a strapping African-American guy named Hayes, who mentors teen crewmember Jimmy, a troubled youth (I feel that much of this sub-plot could be cut).Bruce Baxter, a preening male actor, also goes on the voyage.  It's fully 45 minutes before The Venture crashes on the rocks of skull island--after Denham has been educated by Hayes and the English cook Lumpy about its history (in this version, he has the map to the island, but knows nothing of Kong). <br />      <br />     The natives they find on Skull Island are horrific--pierced, red-eyed, savage--and they kill some of the landing party (Englehorn saves Denham with his Lugar!).  But here, I feel that the logical problems in the film begin--we never see their civilization.  The gigantic wall is a ruin, and where the natives are encountered is a barren wasteland--exactly what is this wall protecting?  These scenes are also filmed like a Sting music video from 1985, I'm guessing to underscore the action; I personally found that to be annoying, but your opinion may differ. <br />      <br />     Ann is kidnapped by the natives in a way even more illogical than in '33 (a native on a huge pole vault [!] Spidermans his way onto the ship and drags her off), and a terrifying female witchdoctor leads the ceremony sacrificing Ann.  Ann is strapped into what looks like a giant slingshot and is semi-catapulted across a ravine to await Kong.  When the big guy shows up, it's a whole lot like the 1976 Dino DeLaurentis version (not the last allusion Jackson makes to that film). <br />      <br />     Denham and the boys set out after Kong, though Denham is seen cranking his camera rather than leading the party (at times, I feel this is taken to ridiculous extremes, especially when he's on the log bridge while Kong is shaking it).  The guys (mostly) survive a brontosaurus/raptor stampede (these scenes have a cartoon feel for me, though others might disagree), and the log bridge scene features more creepy bugs than I think would be logically possible (overall, however, it is effective).  Jimmy machine-guns a ton of the slimy critters off Driscoll at close range--ridiculous, in myview.  Miraculously, Englehorn and Baxter arrive just in time (again) to save Denham. <br />      <br />     In KONG '33, the giant ape's battle with a T-Rex is a highlight (and an inspiration for many filmmakers, including Steven Spielberg).  Because it's the 21st Century now (\\"been there, done that\\"), Kong here--Ann in hand--fights three V-Rex's at once, falling off a cliff in the process and battling them in the hanging vines as they Wiley-Coyote their way to the bottom.  These scenes are Nintendo fast, with sweeping camera, and, as such, are both exciting and annoying--I couldn't catch all that was going on (plus, they're so over the top logically that there's no credibility--and that's saying something, considering we're talking about a film featuring a 25-foot ape).  Anyway, Kong finishes the last one off on the ground in '33 style--in my opinion, the best part of the film (here, Jackson tones down the Sly Cooper imagery, allowing for a long shot or two, which helped me orient the action). <br />      <br />     In a throwback to the '76 version, Ann begins talking with and entertaining Kong (though, unlike the '76 version, there's nothing sexual implied).  These parts are bad in my opinion, and I'd cut them.  Then, Driscoll appears out of nowhere (in '33, we saw him tracking Kong) and--while Kong battles huge bats [!]--the playwright and Ann make their escape by (at first) climbing down a vine, then GRABBING THE FEET OF A BAT and hang-gliding to the river below (this is absolutely the worst thing in the film). <br />      <br />     Like the Denham character Fred Wilson in '76, Denham risks the lives of everybody to capture Kong.  The natives have strangely disappeared (to where?); it's only what's left of The Venture crew behind the wall.  Kong's rampage once he gets through the gate is good, though illogic strikes again when Englehorn shoots him in the leg with a harpoon gun and cripples him (since Kong's brushed off at least three V-Rex bites FLUSH ON HISARMS--which would surely cause more damage--I'm not sure why this harpoon thing threatens him so much).  Ann does the, \\"No, don't kill him!\\" routine, and tries to get off the lifeboat to protect him (awful).  Denham hits the big guy in the face with a bottle of chloroform, puts him to sleep, does the \\"we're millionaires, boys\\" speech, and, like '33, we're suddenly in NYC on Broadway. <br />       <br />     As in the '76 version, Ann and Jack boycott the event (he opens his play off-Broadway, she acts in a review across town).  Denham has Baxter and an un-named actress sub for them.  At this point, Jackson does an interesting homage to Kong '33 by having the on-screen orchestra in the film play a variety of snippets from the original score--which, unfortunately, points up how lacking in drama the score for HIS film is (also, on stage, they recreate the '33 natives and their dance--interesting). <br />      <br />     Wanting to see Ann, Driscoll shows up at Kong's NY unveiling--and, like in '33, the photographers fire away, enraging Kong.  He escapes (a good scene), gets loose, and throws cars around (okay--but, again, Nintendo).  He's chasing Driscoll in a cab and about to kill him, when Ann appears in the street (her hair highlighted in a halo) and calms him down.  He takes her through ice-covered Central Park (complete with decorated trees for Xmas--did they do that in 1933?), and, in an infamous scene, plays on the ice with her until the army starts firing missiles at him (all of this really should have been cut, in my opinion).  He then climbs the Empire State Building--very effective--and sits up there with Ann as the sun rises (absurd). <br />      <br />     Six planes arrive with no warning, and Kong goes 'way on top of the building to battle them.  There are some terrific shots here, though Ann--absurdly, like Dwan in KONG '76--tries to stop the planes from killing him (she apparently has NO FEAR of heights, and--in spite of what must be BRUTAL COLD UP THERE--doesn't shiver once in her party dress as she Indiana Jonses from perch to perch).  In some spectacular images, Kong knocks out three of the planes before they get to him, though he has to take time out from the fight to catch Ann when a ladder comes loose from the side of the building (I get the feeling he could have beaten the planes if he didn't have to worry about her). <br />      <br />     When he finally begins to die, Ann's right on top of the building with him (in high heels, no less), and, as he falters, they stare at each other face to face, sharing a tender goodbye before he slips off (absurd in my view, though most critics don't agree).  Driscoll then appears and hugs her RIGHT ON THE PINNACLE--apparently, this exchange of affection is more important than getting the hell DOWN from there. <br />      <br />     In Dino style, photographers stand on the dead Kong's chest for photos, Denham delivers the famous beauty-killed-beast line (but since he's been presented as such a con man and liar, I'm not sure why we should consider it to be profound, coming from him), and the film comes to an end. <br />      <br />     Overall, I found KONG '05 to be slow in spots, 'way overdone in others, and absurd in several. <br />However, there are enough good things in the film to make me glad I saw it. <br />       <br />     Compared with KONG '33, it's better and it isn't.  Obviously, the effects are far better--though, again, I still feel they're inferior to JURASSIC PARK.  I find KONG '33 to be unintentionally funny in spots--the brontosaurus attack for example (and the jerky stop-motion effects take some getting used-to these days)--but once Kong tangles with the T-Rex, things get good and stay good.  Denham, Ann, and Driscoll all make sense in '33, and I have to give the makers of the original a lot of points for coming up with all of this in the first place.   <br />      <br />     In my view, what Jackson did to Denham in the remake is a crime, and though Ann '33 screamed too much, her \\"save-the-animal\\" sensibility here seems forced, maudlin, and anachronistic (I have to admit, though, that I have no idea how I'd react if I were a gorgeous blonde plaything for a giant ape).  Too, the story MOVED in '33, and the music underscored the drama (a lot of illogical things weren't obvious because of the pace).  In my opinion, Jackson has bogged the story down with unnecessary characters and motivations, and the musical score is nothing special. <br />      <br />     Stylistically, however, I think Jackson's KONG is gorgeous, though as I've mentioned, there are annoying (to me) music video/video game sections.  In short, Jackson and company have made a good film.  Had they stuck closer to the '33 script with modern-day effects, I think it would have been great.  But I'll be buying the DVD from Amazon, no doubt. <br />
B00006RINF|4.0|If you've recently gotten into Lacuna Coil, it's either because you've heard comparisons drawn between them and Evanescence (which is unfounded) or you discovered one of their more recognizable songs, \\"Swamped\\" (which is just the tip of the iceberg). Well, at this point in time, \\"Comalies\\" is the essential Lacuna Coil disc, that is, until they blow up and get bigger very, very soon, as the forecast predicts. It's quite simple to see why they've been getting the attention they deserve. For one thing, a great hard-rock/metal band fronted by a woman is so hard to come by, and Lacuna Coil have one hell of a frontwoman in Cristina Scabbia, whose looks are overshadowed by her gorgeous voice. Plus, the band combines bits of electronica and even classical arrangements into the mix for their own signature style. Truly, comparisons to other bands and lofty gimmicks are not needed when the band is this good.<br /><br />\\"Comalies\\" opens strong with the aformentioned \\"Swamped,\\" which is admittedly starting to sound a little tired by this point. However, the album keeps up momentum with songs like \\"Heaven's A Lie\\" and \\"Self Deception.\\" \\"The Ghost Woman And The Hunter\\" is possibly the darkest yet most gorgeous piece on the album, with it's haunting chorus and twisted keyboard work. Meanwhile, \\"The Prophet Said\\" and \\"Unspoken\\" are more staright-forward, hard-rocking songs that don't take much brainpower to appreciate. \\"Aeon,\\" one of the more stripped down songs of the album, takes a moment to really let Cristina shine, without any dramatics or any male back-up vocals, courtesy of Andrea Ferro.<br /><br />While we're on the subject, I've gotta say, this guy is what brings it down for me. The band is flawless and Cristina is amazing, but Ferro just doesn't bring much to the table, aside from some tacky vocals that just don't fit in. Don't wanna rip into just one person, but honestly, what is he doing here? Otherwise, Lacuna Coils' sound is flawless. All thirteen songs on \\"Comalies\\" are solid, and show a bright future for this band (maybe Ferro's vocals will improve on \\"Karmacode,\\" the upcoming follow-up album). I can totally see Lacuna Coil blowing up this year, so I highly recommend picking up \\"Comalies\\" now.es\\" are solid, and show a bright future for this band (maybe Ferro's vocals will improve on \\"Karmacode,\\" the upcoming follow-up album). I can totally see Lacuna Coil blowing up this year, so I highly recommend picking up \\"Comalies\\" now.
B0009MAO46|5.0|10 years. 20 years. It will be 50 years and this movie won't get old. It doesn't matter that animation is 100 times more detailed and cooler today than it was in 1995, when the movie first came out. The strength of this movie is in the story. There is so much territory to explore on this flic, and you have so much fun while you watch it, that you will never grow tired of it. And, with a 2.5-year old who loves to see Woody once and again, I can tell you it really doesn't get old, no matter how many times you watch it!<br /><br />The second disc does a superb job of accompanying the Pixar classic, going into the legendary details that have made Pixar's DVDs famous. There is plenty to sink your teeth into, for the die-hard fans and those who are simply a bit curious alike. The entire package is a movie for all ages, for the ages. Get it and enjoy it once and again. The truth is you can never go wrong with Woody and Buzz Lightyear!
B000AYQLX6|4.0|John Lennon topped the US Singles chart for the first time in 1974 with the hit Whatever Gets You Thru The Night, a radio-friendly duet with Elton John.     Following the success of the single came the album Walls And Bridges. Despite mixed reviews, the album contained some of the best songs and music Lennon had written throughout his entire career: the soulful Going Down On Love; the rhythmic What You Got (that sounds a lot like Stevie Wonder's Superstition); the slow and beautiful Old Dirt Road (co-written by Harry Nilsson); the dark rock tune Scared, which follows past songs like Isolation; a subliminal angry message to former agent Allen Klein in Steel In Glass (that uses the same musical pattern of How Do You Sleep); the affectionate ballad #9 Dream, also a song for Yoko; and what could possibly be the highlight on Walls And Bridges, the Dylanesque Nobody Loves You (When You're Down And Out), where Lennon expresses his feelings of depression and loneliness in such an honest way.    Walls And Bridges may not be the best Lennon album, but it is definitely one of his standout contributions to rock history.    Recommended    B+
B000E97Y6K|4.0|I absolutely LOVED this remake. I was a little dissappointed at how fake the CGI looked. But then I realized this was done by Universal and we all know how abyssmal Hulk was. But King Kong (the origianl 1933 version) was the movie that put the moviemaking bug into Peter Jackson's head. So this movie was a lifelong dream-come-true for him. <br /> <br />The ONLY complaint I have about this DVD is the fact that it does not include a director commentary. I don't know about anyone else, but I love hearing a director's comments and thoughts. I love hearing what was going through his head when he made a particular scene. That's the only thing that would have made me give this DVD 5 stars.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Very well done, but from Peter Jackson the maker of Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't expect less. Excellent production values and good acting make this well worth seeing. Overall I was very impressed with the movie. Now let me tell you a couple reasons why I didn't give it five stars. I took off one star for the following reasons. It is too long. Not everyone wants to sit through a three hour movie. All my family felt it was to long. Sorry, but Jackson could have cut some of the New York scenes out or a few other spots to make this about two hours or just over and it would have been incredibly good still. I think the natives were a bit overdone as cannibalistic zombies and overall I don't have the desire to sit right back down and watch it again as I did with the LOTR movies. Unlike the LOTR movies some of the time in King Kong dragged a little. Don't get me wrong it is well done and certainly in competition with the original and far above the other remake. I think a little less of head bashing natives and so many New York scenes would have made it better. What happened to them in boats and chased by the dinosaur in the water? And as one other reviewer mentioned Kong fighting three T-Rex was overdone. You saw Jurassic Park, the T-Rex didn't travel in packs, that was Velociraptors. Sure I liked the stampede scene too, and the spiders put back in, but they overdid the number of bugs and shooting them off. I still bought it and I am glad I did as I will certainly go back and watch it in a couple weeks or so, just not tonight. So those of you that love it blindly give me some credit for not being all glassy eyed over it, and those that think it stunk give me some credit for being objective about it. Those of you that vote negative at my review because you disagree are obviously not movie critics but just fans, and that doesn't help someone improve their work. I'll take constructive criticism any day over unfounded praise.
1881273156|5.0|My pastor spoke about the 5 Languages of Love over a few weeks at church.  I was really amazed so I ran out and bought this book.  As I read the book, it was as if all the pieces to a puzzle came together.  I began to look over my past realtionships and have a better understanding as to why they perhaps they did not last.  It made a HUGE difference in my life, I applied it to not only my marriage, but other relationships as well.  Even though there are a few different languages of love books, pick one of them and apply to all of your relationships and see the difference.  It is a must have for everyone in any relationship.
B00006IU73|5.0|It doesn't matter how many times I go back and play this album, I never get tired of it and I cannot praise it enough.  It is undoubtedly one of the most inspired albums ever recorded and you should own it - really - if you care even slightly about brilliant song writing, passion, artistic vision and creative energy.   <br /> <br />Porcupine Tree generally are something out on their own but this...god almighty...it just doesn't get any better. Still, you should also buy Signify, Sky Moves Sideways, Coma Divine, Up The Downstair, Deadwing, Lightbulb Sun, Metanoia...basically, just buy them all.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|Brian Eno's seminal masterpiece is quite simply beyond being among the best ambient albums of all time. It is among the best albums ever, period. Recorded in a time of musical turmoil (think punk) and after his glam stint alongside Roxy Music and helping bring in \\"enossification\\" and some other of his recording techniques into the life of numerous bands in the UK in the mid-to-late seventies, \\"Ambient 1: Music for Airports\\" became a timeless piece without much effort.<br /><br />Eno captured the essence of the instruments he recorded, looping them and interweaving them to accomplish an exquisite minimalist sound in all four songs. From the first track (over 17 minutes in duration), which features pianos and synthesizer, the album captures you. In the second track, the haunting sampled voices that walk the aisles of a multitude of sound layers bring a dimension to the music that was unheard of until then. Track 1/2 combines the instruments from the first two tracks (voices and piano) in a new fashion, due to the phasing of the tape loops, which makes them \\"explore\\" new musical spaces as they evolve through the track's 12+ minutes of duration. The last track only reconfirms the exquisite character of the album, bringing it all back home.<br /><br />The fact that this album was recorded in 1978 is very impressive, since it became a landmark of the ambient movement to follow in future decades. But the fact that it was recorded at all and it reaches such levels of (almost) painful beauty would suffice to place Eno in the level of the best artists and producers alive. Other musicians influenced by Eno that are highly recommendable would be Mark Isham (OST for \\"Crash\\") and Cliff Martinez (OST for \\"Traffic\\").
B000002B30|4.0|I am not a big fan of Bruce Springsteen. I don't understand why people call him \\"the boss\\" anyways. But upon listening to his greatest hits compilation released in 1995, you can't help but fall in love with some of his songs that set the tone of the past 30 years. <br /> <br />The compilation includes the classics Hungry Heart and The River from Bruce's earlier years; the 80's signature songs Dancing In The Dark, My Hometown, and Glory Days; the 90's rockin' ballad Human Touch, the elusive Secret Garden, and the Oscar winning Streets Of Philadelphia. The collection also includes brand new hits as of 1995 which features the dynamic Murder Incorporated. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B
B00005JOUM|2.0|I was not impressed by 'Inside Man' at all; in fact I thought it was below average.  Spike Lee ruined the film by trying to sell a political message about tolerance and equality wrapped up in a long, drawn out and anti-climactic crime caper and it just did not work.<br /><br />While I have nothing against the message that Spike almost always puts into his films, I just felt that the context of this film was inappropriate for the type of movie that Spike is known for making, primarily because the political message overshadowed the main plot of the film, which was the bank robbery.  As it turns out, the movie is nothing like what the trailers leads one to believe, in fact the bank robbery and the hostage negotiation process takes a backseat in a sense to the underlying theme of the film which was bringing awareness to racial inequality and correcting the sins of the past and that actually plays a part in the motive behind the robbery as well.<br /><br />The story itself was not all that intriguing, and the presentation of it was sort of a mess that seemed thrown together at the last minute.  It starts off with a straightforward story with the robbers entering the bank and quickly the audience learns the means by which they will get away with their crime, and even though it has been seen before in other films, it's a rather ingenious escape plan.  Later on though they begin with quick jumps into the future showing interviews with some of the freed hostages, and then all of a sudden they jump back into real time as Denzel's character is attempting to negotiate with the hostages.  It wasn't confusing as much as it was distracting, breaking up the momentum of the robbery and the standoff with the police.  Sprinkled throughout there were people of various ethnic backgrounds and they raised the issue of being harassed by cops because of their looks, and there was heavy emphasis put on these aspects.  Some of the cops were racist due to their jobs dealing with criminals of various backgrounds, and this conflicted with Denzel's character and his partner who were two detectives assigned to the case.  They were actually assigned to the case simply because the main detective was gone on vacation, and there was some initial rejection of them as lead detectives by the primary SWAT cop on the scene played by Willem Dafoe, so once again Spike Lee made ethnicity the main issue.<br /><br />There was a sub-plot involving Jodie Foster as a top-negotiator for the rich and famous, but surprisingly her character was rather minimal and underused.  That was disappointing because she's such a great actress but there was not much for her to work with, and the little that she had seemed kind of pointless even though she worked out a lucrative deal with a couple of key characters.  To be honest, the movie would not have suffered had she not been in it at all.<br /><br />Denzel's character Keith Frazier left much to be desired.  There was not much that I really liked about his character or found intriguing or endearing.  There was not a great deal of depth to him period, which left me not caring one way or another in regards to what happens to him, and his partner Bill Mitchell was even less developed.<br /><br />Then there were the bank robbers, and the only one that was even slightly fleshed out was Clive Owen's Dalton Russell, but by the end of the film, we know next to nothing about who he was or what his motivation was.  Sure, the audience can make an assumption about his role in the bank robbery based on the final outcome, but do we really know his true motivation?  Maybe he was a part of the family, or perhaps he was just a man hired for the job, but it's impossible to say for sure.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer was another actor that more or less wasted his talent in this film because he was the stereotypical rich white man who had stepped on too many toes in his life to get where he was at, and he had attempted to atone for his sins ever since histransgressions took place, yet there was not enough screen time devoted to his character to really give any sense of emotion to his motivation nor his plight to right his grievous wrongs.  Was his motivation explained, yes, but it was miniscule to the point of striking on par.<br /><br />As the movie ends on a less than exciting note, I'm left with a movie that really drags on in the middle with no characters that were engaging in any way, and neither the heroes nor villains had enough idiosyncrasies or dynamic chemistry between them to make it a memorable or entertaining film.  I would not even go as far as saying that it is a film worth watching just to pass time.  The movie felt schizophrenic as in it had two vastly different personalities but not enough personality to make either one a whole person, and there was not enough of a story to keep one's interest throughout and beyond the end credits.<br /><br />Essentially it is an anti-racism movie and also a heist movie, but it never quite becomes either of the two themes and ultimately leaves the audience stranded somewhere in the middle between the two which makes for a very unsatisfying and unfulfilled film that had great potential given the cast, talent and basic premise, leaving much to be desired.er since his transgressions took place, yet there was not enough screen time devoted to his character to really give any sense of emotion to his motivation nor his plight to right his grievous wrongs.

B0000029LG|5.0|Michael Jackson is the greatest artist of all time and I have followed his work from day one....he has a gift that no one can describe.The dancing,singing,song writing etc.There is no better artist than can perform better on stage.Also Michael still remains the biggest selling artist and of course has the biggest selling album of all time \\"Thriller\\".On this album \\"History\\" he finally gets down with the press and lets them have it.I don't blame him either.Every artist will have a deep and personal album..and this happens to be MJ's.This album did sell well though.It debuted #1 in the US and spawned some amazing singles.\\"Scream\\"(duet with Janet Jackson)debuted at #5 on the Pop Charts...and You Are Not Alone debuted at #1 (the first song in history to do so)...also had one more single \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" #30.I believe it would of gone higher if it had not been removed from radio stations.It's a great song.The album is certified 7x platinum in the US and has sold nearly 21 million worldwide.An of course everyone is going to love Disc 1...but on Disc 2 there are a few songs to skip but some that are very good.No one can forget the classics on Disc 1....Billie Jean,The Way You Make Me Feel,Black Or White,Bad,Beat It,Thriller,Remember The Time etc.You never get tired of hearing these songs.Now for Disc 2 there a few highlights.Scream,They Don't Care About Us,Stranger In Moscow,Earth Song,You Are Not Alone,Childhood,Tabloid Junkie,2Bad,Smile,and the title cut.Thats about it.But this cd is well worth the purchase.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was one of the best series I have ever seen, sci-fi or not. <br /> <br />Sure I could download the show... but I will probably buy the whole series and the movie, to show my support in hopes that it will be restarted!  Worked for Family Guy.  Come on people.
6304936303|3.0|This movie is a cross between Die Hard and Willis' David Addison of Moonlighting fame: violent, wise-cracking, slapstick and football - what more could a guy want.  It is, however, over the top with more cursing than necessary, but believe it or not the chemistry works between Willis and Wayans.  I was hoping it might spawn a sequel or two given that Willis at the end of the film asks Wayans to join him as a partner in his detective business.  Perhaps the box office take just wasn't there.  Lots of comedians in this film.  Wayans comical, but in a more serious role, Rick Ducommon as the guy with the car in his pool and Taylor Negron steals this movie as the oh so seriously deadly Milo.  Chelsea Field hasn't much of a part, but this movie does seem to have a low opinion of women.  Also, despite her unnecessarily foul mouth Danielle Harris as Darian is charming despite that preoccupation.  If you blink or go to the fridge you'll miss Halle Berry.
B00069YE0W|5.0|This album is magnificent, I have a copy of it on vinyl (recordcollectionmusic.com) but unfortunatly not on CD.  I say unfortunatly, because while the quality of vinyl is so much more alive, it is extremely difficult to carry around.  I suggest buying both, the CD for the car and the Ipod, and the Vinyl for relaxing at home to the musical stylings of, in my opinion, one of the century's greatest musician.  John Frusciante has never disappointed, and he exceeded my expectations astoundingly with his newest works.  The Vinyl has a different arraingment of songs, which I think flows better. <br />1. The Past Recedes <br />2. lever Pulled <br />3. Anne <br />4. The Real <br />5. A Name <br />6. Control <br />7. Your Warning <br />8. Hope <br />9. Ascension <br />10. Time Tonight <br />11.

B000000W5F|3.0|The line you hear repeated in reviews on this site, as well as elsewhere, is that Tattoo You is the last great Stones album.  In a sense this might be true, as no subsequent album contained any songs as good as Start Me Up or Waiting On A Friend.  However, I think it's more accurate to describe Tattoo You, as an album, as the first mediocre to poor release by the Stones, inferior overall to Emotional Rescue.  While Emotional Rescue took risks, Tattoo You sounds stale and uninspired in comparison.  And the risks they do take are not executed as well. <br /> <br />However, since Waiting For A Friend was inexplicably left off of Forty Licks, even the casual fan must buy this album to get that song, unless you can find a copy of the out of print \\"Rewind\\" compilation somewhere.  Along with this song, you'll get Start Me Up, and a few other decent songs such as the moody \\"Heaven,\\" the fun Keith song \\"Little T&A,\\" and the Mick Taylor leftover \\"Tops.\\"  Other than these tracks, however, there's really not much to get excited about.  \\"Black Limousine\\" sounds flat due to either bad production or uninspired playing, perhaps both.  \\"High Fire\\" sports the Stones attempting some sort of new wave sound, which could be good or bad depending on your taste.  \\"Neighbors\\" has to be one of their worst songs as of this album's release date - the drums sound terrible, the production is bad, and you realize how much better it could have been when you hear the superior version on Live Licks.  The rest of the tracks are similarly mediocre, although not poor.   <br /> <br />The notion that this is so much better than later releases just doesn't hold up.  Compare \\"Neighbors\\" to \\"You Got Me Rocking,\\" \\"Saint Of Me,\\" or \\"Oh No, Not You Again\\" on later albums.  More such comparisons can be done, but I will not do them here.  Bottom line - the Stones 90s-2000s output is underrated, and this album is overrated.
B000083E79|2.0|Cher has been around since the 60's and she may of had a few hits but still she cannot sing.She sounds alot like Madonna.Now some of her songs were catchy such as I Got You Babe,Half Breed,If I Could Turn Back Time,and Gypsys,Tramps,& Thieves.But as for the song Believe...that was just horrible....but if your a new Cher fan...this would be good for you
B000E97Y6K|4.0|First I would just like to state that I am a huge LOTR fan, so I had high hopes for this movie. As I watched this movie in the theaters I was not very impressed for the first hour. I felt Jackson spent too much time setting up the rest movie when he really did not need to do so. As a result, the first third of this movie dragged. However, once the movie got to Skull Island things picked up quickly.<br /><br />The second part of the movie is where the film won me over. It took on a Jurassic Park-like feel except better. The special effects were incredible (the clips showen on TV do not do it justice). The battle between Kong and the T-Rexs is sure to become a classic. Also, the relationship between Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) and Kong went much more indepth than the 1933 version. I think Jack Black did a good job in his role although some critics did not think so. Another area of the film that really impressed me was the realistic 1930's New York. I urge anyone who watches the film to look at how detailed the city really is including advertisements for real 1930's radio shows.<br /><br />If not for the slow beginning, I would have given this movie 5 stars.

B00000JKH2|5.0|Vaya is one of those EP's that should have been an full length album. Aside from the debut record, Vaya is ATDI's most emotionally  intense records due to the choatic nature of all those involved. That compiled with the ametuer like musicianship make Vaya that much more intense. <br /> <br />Though the album open's up with a slightly subdue song, the rest of the disc picks up from there. Just about every song is comes at you full force and without inhibition, evening the slower ones. However, the songs are well written and fully formed. This is ATDI's most sophisticated album before they decided to take it a notch up on the slightly overrated Relationship of Command. Prime cuts include Ursa Minor and Heliotrope, though all seven songs are worth listening to. <br /> <br />Put this one on if you're going to have a quick drive. The intense beginning and slightly subdued ending will have an effect on your mind so that you will feel angry and then feel calmed. By far, this is one the best EP's you can get. If you are a fan of ATDI, then do yourself a favor and get this. You will listen to it nonstop.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Without repeating everyone else's review, in which I totally have to agree, this soundtrack definitely compliments the movie.  My favorite track is \\"Your Hands Are Cold\\", this is truly a beautiful piece of music that worked well in the scene with Lizzie and Darcy in the field..
B000084T18|3.0|Tracks: <br />1. Intro - N/A - 6 seconds of a gun. Woopdeedoo. <br />2. What Up Gangsta - 4/5 - Annoying chorus, but the verses are fine. Good beat. <br />3. Patiently Waiting - 5/5 - Eminem steals the song from 50, but it still an amazing song. One of the 3 best songs on the CD. <br />4. Many Men - 5/5 - One of 50's best songs ever. Everything works in this song. <br />5. In Da Club - 4.5/5 - Good song to blast in your car (well, maybe back in 2003). Still, it's a good song 3 years later. My little problem is 50 is hard to understand in parts of the song. <br />6. High All The Time - 3.5/5 - Good, but not great, song. As a side note, 50 admits in interviews to not smoking so how exactly does he get high all the time? <br />7. Heat - 4/5 - Gets mindnumbing in spots, but a great beat saves the song. <br />8. If I Can't - 4/5 - Good song. Gets boring in a hurry though. <br />9. Blood Hound - 2/5 - This song sucks. Just plain annoying. Young Buck isn't very good either. <br />10. Back Down - 5/5 - Great Ja Rule diss. Especially the ending. Hahahaha. <br />11. P.I.M.P. - 2.5/5 - Great song to play if in your at a party, but otherwise it's just an overrated and overplayed radio single. Gets old real fast. <br />12. Like My Style - 3/5 - Okay song, although Yayo doesn't do very much and 50 doesn't rap very well. Easily skippable. <br />13. Poor Lil Rich - 1/5 - 50 sucks on this song, the beat is whack, and it's just plain annoying. Boo! <br />14. 21 Questions - 4.5/5 - Pretty good song. Nate Dogg does a very good chorus. Even though it was way overplayed, it's very catchy. <br />15. Don't Push Me - 5/5 - The best member of G-Unit Lloyd Banks and Eminem drop amazing verses. 50 also does a great chorus and a great verse. Cool song. <br />16. Gotta Make It To Heaven - 1/5 - Worst song on the CD. I can't even get through 30 seconds of the song it's so bad.  <br /> <br />Overall: 3.6/5 <br /> <br />Bonus Cuts: <br />17. Wanksta - 5/5 - Great song to play in your car. 50 has agreat flow. <br />18. U Not Like Me - 2/5 - Annoying and stupid. The only good part is the opening.  <br />19. Life's Life On The Line - 5/5 - Great song. One of 50's best.    <br /> <br />To sum up, GRODT has some very good tracks but some really bad filler mixed in. G-Unit's \\"Beg For Mercy\\" and The Game's \\"The Documentary\\" albums are much better.
B000E6ESL2|3.0|Marc Foster's Stay has lots of visual flair, but not a lot of discernable content. It's a silly, perplexing psychological thriller, featuring some good performances, but is ultimately dressed up like one of those pretentious Euro trash video installations. Stay is a dreamy, surreal exercise in what is imagined, a world of delusion and illusion, where the lines between reality and fantasy are constantly crossed; it's just a pity that through most of the film, it's not clear what is going on.  <br /> <br />Henry (Ryan Gosling) is a damaged and disturbed young student, who starts seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor). He's been hearing voices and he can't deal with the fact that his parents died a horrible, blistering, scorching death in a car accident on the Brooklyn Bridge. Henry tells the doctor that he's going to kill himself on Saturday at midnight, so they only have 3 days to talk.  <br /> <br />Sam lives with Lila, his girlfriend (Naomi Watts). She teaches art and worries that her own work doesn't pass muster. Lila once tried to commit suicide and Sam worries that she might try it again, even though she now realizes that life is too full of beauty.  Sam becomes steadily more obsessed and worried about Henry and goes looking for him around the city, bumping into acquaintances of the young man - an actress-waitress (Elizabeth Reaser) who used to serve Henry pecan pie at a diner, a recently-blinded gentleman (Bob Hoskins) who may be his father, Henry's former doctor (Janeane Garofalo) whom he apparently drove nuts, and his supposedly dead mother (Kate Burton). <br /> <br />As Sam discovers more about his patient, the movie begins to drift into a bizarre dreamlike territory and there's a real sense of spiritual and emotional anxiety from all the characters. Henry shows his emotions intensely and you see the inner turmoil that's going on inside his head. You feel his grief and pain - especially when he burns himself with a cigarette on a subway train.<br /> <br />However, the problem with Stay is that Forster isn't devoted to seriously understanding the human experience of his characters or the precarious connections that are purported to exist between their physical world and the sacred spiritual beyond. Stay's cheap window dressing - the flashy, conceited visual effects, and the irritating jump cut editing, simply exists to blind us from the fact that its story is pretty slender, mechanical, even soulless.

B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is one of the most difficult bands to get into. Frankly, I find it hard to believe so many people are fans of them. However, many of these fans tend to only align themselves with more popular songs, lending credence to the fact that Tool is not a friendly band.    Lateralus may even be the most difficult of their albums to sit through. Aside from the more friendly songs Schism and Parabola, the rest of the album remains full of dynamics that most fans of music will not be able to appreciate, let alone like. However, for those willing to sit through this 80 minute sonic assult, Lateralus is one the most amazing records to ever be released.    Many of the songs are not of the traditional song length, even the singles. Plus, like the rest of Tool's albums, this one remains a complete work, so it is not wise to just listen to individual songs because they do not tell the whole story nor sound as impressive when juxtaposed with the rest of the songs. So much is going on that missing the many piece of the puzzle and  focusing on the more commerical ones will leave you with the idea that Tool is nothing more than an art rock band.    However, the music contained on this disc is not much complex for the sake of being complex. Sometimes, having such songs can still result in commercial appeal, such as in bands like Yes or metal bands that themselves too seriously. Listening to Tool requires patience that many of us do not have. I found myself listening to this one several times before I really started to like. With that, it's hard to recommend just any single song because Tool's albums are not meant for that. Despite Tool's massive popularity, chances are many of their fans do not truly like this album in its entirety.    Is this one worth getting? You must have a lot of patience for this one; It won't sink in immediatley. However, if you were willing to look past the popular songs and focus on this one as a whole and give it time, you will find Lateralus to be an albumshimmering with pure genius.
B00005JOFQ|1.0|Rejected by most moviegoers but not for the reasons the left wants you to believe. It is a boring movie and the characters were too wooden and not believable. There were no real 'good people', just victims of numerous bad decisions. The two cowboys were victims and later they turned their families into victims of adultery, pain, and betrayal.<br /> Many couples got up and left the theatre and it was only a quarter full at best even after the Academy Awards. An American tragedy with one redeeming quality ... the nature scenes were very well filmed. Save your money and buy The Chronicles of Narnia.
B0007O38F8|3.0|Tracks: <br />1. Intro - N/A - Maybe he should have changed the intro, since the album didn't come out on Valentine's Day.  <br />2. In My Hood - 3/5 - Kinda catchy, but gets really boring and annoying. <br />3. This Is 50 - 2/5 - Beat sucks. 50's rhymes suck. The song just sucks.  <br />4. I'm Supposed To Die Tonight - 4/5 - One of the few listenable tracks on this CD. I especially like the chorus. <br />5. Piggy Banks - 2/5 - Weak diss. I could make a better diss. Dissing people like Jadakiss just for being on a song with Ja Rule and saying he's only like in New York is just stupid. His rhymes also suck in this song. The beat is the only good thing about this song.  <br />6. Gatman & Robbin' - 2/5 - Eminem just plain sucks on this song. 50 has truly poisoned Eminem. Eminem used to be so good, but he's slowly slipping. This song is just stupid and annoying. <br />7. Candy Shop - 3/5 - This song should be renamed Magic Stick Pt. 2. Anyways, it is fairly catchy and the beat fits the song well. However, it was way overplayed and now I just hate it. <br />8. Outta Control - 4/5 - Fun song to listen to. Great beat. <br />9. Get In My Car - 4/5 - I also like this song. It's good, but not great. The hook is quite catchy. I think 50 could have released this song as a single.   <br />10. Ski Mask Way - 2.5/5 - This song is okay but it gets boring and it's easily skippable.  <br />11. A Baltimore Love Thing - 2/5 - Good concept, bad execution. As with the song before, it is easily skippable. <br />12. Ryder Music - 4.5/5 - This song is actually quite good. Great song to vibe to. Great hook. <br />13. Disco Inferno - 4.5/5 - Great club song. Good song to blast in your car. Really good beat. <br />14. Just A Lil Bit - 2.5/5 - This song has been a million times before. The beat sounds middle eastern to me for some reason. The beat is actually quite annoying. 50's voice is alos annoying. <br />15. Gunz Come Out - 3/5 - Okay song to listen every now and again. Gets boring after awhile. Good hook. <br />16. My Toy Soldier - 4/5 - Good song. Both 50 and Yayo have a good flow on this song.  <br />17. Position of Power - 2/5 - One of the most annoying and boring songs on this CD. Okay beat.  <br />18. Build You Up - 3.5/5 - I don't really 50 on this song, however Jamie Foxx and the beat make song good. Good hook.  <br />19. God Gave Me Style - 4.5/5 - One of the few good songs on this CD. There should have been more songs like this on the CD. 50 has good lyrics and flow. <br />20. So Amazing - 1/5 - Olivia sucks. She should leave G-Unit and pursue a different career. This song is exactly what is wrong with 50. He claims to be a big gangster yet releases pop crap like this. Such a bad song.  <br />21. I Don't Need Em' - 3/5 - Okay song. 50 has a good flow. Catchy. <br />22. Hate It Or Love It [G-Unit Remix] - 5/5 - Best song on here. The Game and Lloyd Banks steal the show from 50.  <br /> <br />Overall: 3.1/5 <br /> <br />50 should stick to more grimy songs and stay away from crappy pop songs. This CD is an example of why. Very disappointing.
6304362498|5.0|I read the powerful and compelling novel \\"1984\\" in the late 1970s and I eagerly welcomed the film adaptation of the book. Watching the movie in 1984, I was thrilled by the way it brought to life the dark and grim story of life in Oceania.<br /><br />The movie relates the story of Winston Smith (wonderfully played by John Hurt) who is unfortunate enough to live in the London of Oceania. For convinience, he is a member of the ruling party. He has to go through the motions to survive in a country where the party has total monopoly of power. He is daily exposed (and unwillingly participates) to the lies that are the daily bread for the people. His job at the Ministry of Information involves tampering with history and changing facts to fit the will of the party with absolutely no regard to reality.<br /><br />This is a deeply disturbing film especially in view of the fact that there are people to this very day who live in circumstances not too far removed from that depicted in the movie, where Big Brother is always watching and where people are not expected to think for themselves and the umwritten party slogan is \\"Ignorance is Strength; Freedom is Slavery\\".<br /><br />The atmosphere in the film is stiff to reflect the dark story in a stinky and dingy London. One sees bombed out builbings creating a desolate and hopeless atmosphere. The constant shortages of basic necessities of life and endless propaganda seal the misery and doom for the hapless people of Oceania.<br /><br />In summary, an outstanding film with excellent acting and powerful and compelling message about the evils of communism and fascism.
B000EQH2QK|5.0|Do not worried about the extra tracks here if you already purchased OF2, using your copy you can download for FREE the extra tracks. People who wants to make drama out of this just wants to be irritating. Hips dont lie is a perfect song for this record. La tortura is already a hit all around the world. Add that to the songs already recorded in OF2 and you get an awesome record. OF2 was good as it was, but I always felt something was missing. I know now what was it: Shakiras unique latino flavour! Hips dont lie adds a whole new dimension to this record. This isnt Mimi's effort to get more money out of her fans. Shakira is a unique star, not a diva, just a musician, singer and a excellent performer. 5 stars from me to OF2 with the extra tracks!
B000E97Y6K|5.0|The more I watch this movie, the more I am awe struck and taken with it.  It is truley the 'Titanic' of 2005.  It has it all.  It is visually stunning.  King Kong is argueably the most well done CGI character ever.  1930's New York city is recreated beautifully.  The acting in this movie is excellent, especially Naomi Watts' performance which is mainly reacting to blue screens and a human stand-in for Kong.  Andy Serkis also deserves recognition for his portrayal of Kong.  The love story between beauty and the beast is done extremely well, this aspect alone is far superior to any other version of this movie.  The story is faithful to the original while not coming off as a copy of it.   I was on the edge of my seat, I was captivated, and I was even touched by the awesome spectacle that is King Kong.  I would have done a few things differently, but I feel King Kong finally got the retelling that it has always deserved.  Kudos to Peter Jackson, the man is an artist.
B000B5XOXY|5.0|Yes, I know, loving this movie isn't a popular opinion, but I'm going to go against the grain and speak out for this guilty pleasure of mine, particularly after seeing the 2-disc special edition dvd recently...    Batman Forever and its' very different tone from the first two, Tim Burton-driven films, was made to appeal to a far wider audience than those very dark films, while keeping the spirit of the Batman mythos intact. I believe the film accomplished this. There were plenty of bright lights, new bat-gizmos and bat-gadgets, exciting action-fight scenes, and even a young, edgy, heart-throb in Chris O'Donnell's Robin to appeal to kids without worrying their parents too much, and at the same time, Batman/Bruce Wayne's tortured psyche, duality and isolation was presented respectfully. Batman's darkness was still there, just shown more subltely, less graphically, yet no less tragically because we don't actually SEE people dying horribly left and right.     The story had substance and was a worthy addition to the Batman mythos. Backstories not previously touched upon were explored to my satisfaction, and the added deleted scenes in this version of the dvd flesh things out even further and make me wish that time restrictions on theatrical releases weren't quite so stringent.    Bob Kane, the creator of the Batman comic character, has said that of all the actors who have played Batman over the years, he thought blond Val Kilmer was the best and I agree. Kilmer is statuesque and stoic in the cowl and cape, using his eyes and lips to formidable effectiveness; his jaw and mouth are strong and perfectly suited for the confines of the costume.  He moved well in it, even doing some of his own martial arts (such as in the opening sequence, at the bank). The stuntmen, when they took over for him, were well matched to his body type, effective and visually exciting. And Kilmer's Bruce Wayne is suave, debonair, totally believable as the lonely billionare turned Dark Knight, comfortable with his wealth but still compassionate and aware of others' plight, just as Bob Kane intended this character.      Also, I want to put to rest the insistance of some reviewers here that several of the actors involved with the project didn't want to be.  That is nonsense; no one forced them to do the movie, and Kilmer very much wanted to do the sequel, Batman and Robin, but was under contractual obligation to do the movie The Saint. (This fact documented on IMBD). He may have driven the director to distraction with his attention to minute detail and insistance on getting everything just so, but there was no bad blood between them and Schumaker still maintains that he respects Kilmer as an actor and performer. Kilmer took the role seriously (as he does everything) and doesn't need to make any apologies for his performance. How I wish they could have worked something out so that Kilmer could have reprised the role again, rather than bringing in the forever-smirking, abominable Clooney...    My favorite character always, Alfred, was back, played by the delightful Michael Gough, who can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned. And everyone else is well-cast too.     Director Joel Schumaker offers interesting commentary in this dvd, and made a comment at the very beginning which I wish all the fans up in arms over the nipples in the costumes would take to heart: \\"Those people need to get out more.\\" He also makes another point about whose codpiece is bigger...let's not take things so seriously, hmm?    Overall, this extended version and extras are well worth the higher price for anyone who enjoyed the movie or likes to know what goes on while making a film. Great extras, including shorts on costuming, scoring, special effects, stunts, and the actors/character, added to the overall positive experience. This is a lighter but no less legitimate incarnation of these characters.    Highly recommeded.
0425188809|5.0|Watcher is probably Dean Koontz's most well known book. Devout fans say it is his best and other people do too. Well I love Dean Koontz and have read 15 of his books. While this one is amazing it is definitely not my favorite of his. In fact I like a lot of his other books better. I don't know why, but I do. Know don't get me wrong Watchers is an amazing story. It basically has every thing in it; love, hope, hit men, FBI, evil monster, smart golden retriever, scientist, mutations, and don't forget a psycho television repair man. <br />  <br /> Yes it is that good. I don't really want to say too much about the plot because the less you know about it the better it is. All I will say it that there is two dogs that have been experimented with. One is amazingly smart the other it mutilated and blood hungry. They both escape from the lab which causes a spring of events to happen and the least likely people to come together. This and the Taking are the ones the show Koontz's love for dogs the most. He makes you love that dog like it was a person and even makes yo feel sorry for the beast. <br /> <br /> This book will take you on an amazing journey and you will never forget it. <br />I am giving this book five stars and I highly recommend it, but if you are looking for Koontz's best look elsewhere. <br />Here is some of the Best <br />Intensity <br />The Face <br />False Memory <br />Hideaway <br />The Bad Place <br />Velocity  <br />
B000002H33|5.0|What can I say about this album? It's pure heaviness mixed in with speed and metallic genius. Every song has it's own vibe and a dose of brilliance in it. This was Metallica's finest moment and I dare to say, a milestone for Metal in general.The significance of this album for the genre is uncalculable and it will live on as one of the finest moments in Music history. <br /> <br />1.\\"Battery\\" - Starts out acoustic (like it's predecessor \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\") and transforms into an assault of pure thrash metal.  <br /> <br />2.\\"Master of Puppets\\"- Cliff Burton said this was one of his favorite Metallica songs and I think we all agree. The song starts off heavy and the chorus is just amazing. The mid section slows down to this beautiful melody and then builds up to the balls and chunk again. Brilliant <br /> <br />3.\\"The Thing that Should not Be\\"- Very Underrated and quite possibly one of the heavisest riffs of all time. H.P Lovecraft inspired lyrics added to the mix equals a great heavy tune. <br /> <br />4. \\"Sanitarium\\"- Amazing riff similar to \\"Fade to Black\\" but a bit more expanded. Great song and lyrics and the end riff is chunky as hell> <br /> <br />5.\\"Disposable Heroes\\"- Thrash defined!! the section where it builds up culminating with cliff bringing in the bass is what thrash is all about. Not to mention speed and a great solo by Hammett in this one.  <br /> <br />6.\\"Leper Messiah'- Good song. The main Riff is slow and heavy but the real good part is the mid section. the galloping riff after the solo is amazing. <br /> <br />7.\\"Orion\\" - Arguably the best song on the album. The bass solos during the entire song show off the unique talent in Cliff Burton. I'd say it's the highlight of the album but the album is more like the highlight of thrashmetal. <br /> <br />8.\\"Damage inc\\"- Finishing the album in pure shredding style. This song's intro is another display of showmanship by Burton and the song itself is pure technical speed. perfect ending to a perfect album!!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril isn't what you'd call a talented singer, but she proves to us that she can write good songs that will last.<br /><br />\\"Under my Skin\\" is the second album of this young Canadian rock singer, if compared to \\"Let Go\\", \\"Under My Skin\\" is darker, and we can now tell that Lavigne has grown, from her skater punk rock lyrics to \\"Nobody's Home\\", a song about a lost girl who kind of went the in the wrong direction... I was surprised that Lavigne can write songs like this. \\"Happy Ending\\" is the best out of this album, about a guy getting influenced by his friends who doesn't like this singer. Yes, most of the lyrics are shallow, and Lavigne doesn't usually show a lot of feelings when she is recording.<br /><br />From what I've heard, \\"Don't Tell Me\\" was written even before her first single from \\"Let Go\\", \\"Complicated\\". \\"Freak Out\\", another one of my favorites about believing in yourself and your own decisions (that's what Avril REALLY likes to write about, I'm actually tired of it already)is also written before.<br /><br />I used to think although I enjoy Avril Lavigne's songs, her success had been pure luck. Now I look forward to her next album, hoping it comes soon with better music!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|It seems like many people feel strongly about this film, one way or another. That fact that this film is met with as much fear and hatred as it is with love and acceptance is to me a testament to its impact. Perhaps this film is not for everyone, but I found it to be exquisitely articulated and by far one of the finest films I have ever seen. This film depicts true love.
B000002OX7|5.0|I'll be up front with everybody here and tell you that I'm not a huge fan of The Who in general, but I am absolutely into this CD.  It's got all my Who favorites on it including the classic \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" which is probably my favorite FM Rock hit from the 1970's.<br /><br />Add to this Baba O'Riley, Bargain (a great love song if you really liten to it), Behind Blue Eyes, and Going Mobile, and you've got just about all great Who songs that were played so much by the FM Rock stations back in the 1970's.  I really loved this stuff, and now this great album has been remasters and I'm listening to it on Sennheiser headphones and I'm hearing instrumental pieces I've never heard before.  So in a way I'm hearing it for the first time.
B000E5N62U|4.0|It's great to hear that typical late-Steely Dan/Nightfly-inspired sound in this new Donald Fagen release.  I liked it right away, particularly \\"What I Do,\\" which has the same kind of instantly familiar feeling of some of the best cuts on Gaucho and Aja.  However, that's not my usual reaction to a new production by Fagen.  In the past I have found myself disappointed upon the first, third, or fifth playing of new discs, but they have generally grown on me to the point that I hang on each subtle note or musical variation.  The fact that I liked this disc right away is a bit disconcerting.  Does this mean that over time I will appreciate it less?  Let's hope not.  This is Fagen's best since \\"Nightfly.\\"  While not containing a breakthrough cut or innovation that will become a classic, it's very listenable and accessible.  Comfortable right out of the shrink wrap.  I only hope it wears that well over time.
B00008H2LB|3.0|I thought Hybrid Theory was a powerful album and therefore had high hopes. But the follow up, Meteora, really hasn't got any special ingrediants in it, or you could say Linkin Park has gone in a slightly different direction. <br />Most of the songs sounded the same, except \\"Faint\\" and \\"Numb\\", the better songs from Meteora. \\"Faint\\" with the fast violin sounds like old Chinese orchestra hushed up, which I found enjoyable. \\"Numb\\" is a strong but slow song (WHAT was the opening instrument? Computers?) which I liked right away, from the first second to last. The singles \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" and \\"Breaking the Habit\\" are other songs that I kept listening to. I find that I can't relate to any of these songs, I didn't think that I was going to, either. All their lyrics are poetic but too pessimistic. There are unique hard rock in here, but the similarity of songs in the album are too great. The one thing I like most about Likin Park is that they sing every song with feelings. Even though you can't truely take in the lyrics cuz sometimes it's hard to understand, you totally think they're singing from the inside.  <br />It is a good album if you want a release when there's too much pressure (works better than Hybrid Theory), but other than that, it hasn't been in my CD player a lot.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Peter Jackson has firmly established himself as a director on the level of masters like Steven Spielberg. King Kong takes us on a journey ranging from the highest highs to the lowest lows. This is truly a stunningly powerful remake of the classic tale--a tale which inspired Mr. Jackson to get into film making in the first place. <br /> <br />First and foremost are the special effects. Let's face it, this whole movie hinges on whether or not Kong is believable. We all remember The Hulk which brought us the inhuman, laughable green man-thing. Not the case here: Jackson creates a beast that is not only believable, but lovable and powerful as well. His quirky mannerisms and expressions shine on the big screen, as does his fascination with the lovely Ms. Darrow. <br /> <br />Beyond Kong, are the dinosaurs and bugs. Kong does battle with several fierce dinos to protect Ann and the action sequences are incredible as are the dinosaurs themselves. Ann's rescue squad come across some problems of their own in the form of large insects and blobs that eat you one limb at a time. All if which is both exciting an disgusting. The SGI guys working on Jurassic Park 4 might want to take notes here. <br /> <br />Jackson goes even further and creates a complete digital model of 1933 Manhattan. Every single building is remade. Why you ask? So during the final shots of Kong battling the airplanes on top of the Empire State Building, Jackson is free to use broad and uncompromised camera angles. The entire final sequence is emotionally draining and acrophobic as the height and scale are surreal. <br /> <br />The final compelling attribute to King Kong is the bond between him and Ann Darrow. All Kong wants is to be with her and protect her. He battles dinosaurs, people and airplanes to be so. When he's taken to NYC and teased with a fake Ann, he goes ballistic to find her. Their reunion is both beautiful and sad since we all know the final outcome. Kong's chase though crowded Manhattan is another spectacular display. <br /> <br />All in all, this film is an astonishing piece of cinematic work. Jackson nails every single aspect of what an action movie slash love story should be. While some say its a bit long, you do get sucked in and time goes by rather quickly. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, period.
0201721481|5.0|This is by far the best C++ book I have ever read. It is comprehensive, explanations are simple and to the point, and, up-to-date. I am referring to the 4th edition, of course. The earlier editions might be a bit outdated.
B000EQ5SRK|5.0|On the verge of Basic Instinct 2, a re-evaluation of Sharon Stone's film career is in order.   <br /> <br />Looking through the reviews, it becomes apparent SLIVER is not necessarily an acclaimed film, but don't let that discourage you!  When you choose a Sharon Stone movie from the shelf, you probably aren't looking for a pretentious \\"message\\" picture. You are looking for entertainment, full of glamour, thrills, sex, romance, melodrama, and excitement--and that's just where the priorities are in this film. <br /> <br />It is not a dumb film. The script is well-written, the cinematography was ahead of its time, and the direction is expert. Sharon Stone is at her best as the vulnerable and lonely Carly, and gives a deep, knowing performance, but the supporting cast varies in ability. Nina Foch and Martin Landau are wasted in small roles.   <br /> <br />Many complaints concern the ending--which is apparently not true to Ira Levin's novel. Most book-to-screen adaptations are easy to find fault with when comparing to the book. As a viewer who has not read the book, the film is effective, and that is all that really matters!  The film holds its own, and is its own piece of art. <br /> <br />And art this really is--the soundtrack, including the score by Howard Shore, is tremendously effective in maintaining the eerie, lonely mood of the film.  The glossy, luxurious atmosphere is also an asset.   <br /> <br />It's surprising now to read so many negative reviews, because as far as film-making is concerned, SLIVER is not a B-movie at all. It is a very classy affair. It should not be looked at as camp or cheese, because its intentions were not to be a serious message film. It aims to be what it is--an entertaining star vehicle for Sharon Stone at the height of her beauty and stardom! <br /> <br />It really should not be surprising, though, that SLIVER is often ridiculed as a \\"bad\\" film, when our society seems to think the only films worth watching are pretentious message films (not that messages are always bad; BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN contained a very relevant and necessary message, but some films just tell messages for the sake of it, and that is the nature of camp, in my opinion).  <br /> <br />It also should not be surprising that SLIVER is so hated, considering the conservative nature of much of American society! SLIVER is a film which includes a lot of sex, nudity, and other sophisticated situations which imply \\"sin.\\" Puritans will surely find something to dislike here!  I think in the early 1990s, a lot of people went to movies like BASIC INSTINCT and INDECENT PROPOSAL, enjoyed them, and then bashed them later on because they were ashamed to say they liked such a film. The truth is they were daring, intelligent films which do not deserve their negative reputation. SLIVER is among them! <br /> <br />So, I am proud to be an exception, and say that SLIVER is a thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining, and well-made film!  It certainly is a piece of art, and if you are looking for a message, you might just find it has something to say about voyeurism, as well as sexual and romantic independence. <br />
B00005JOWF|2.0|I saw this movie last night it sucks so bad i should of known there were 3 people in the theater including me sad storyline awful fighting i feel asleep i think dont waste ur money on it
B000E97Y6K|5.0|With his fabulous remake of KING KONG (2005), Peter Jackson tops his Oscar-winning LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and enters a movie lover's pantheon for me.  This is my favorite film of last year and it could become one of my personal favorite movies of all time.  It is that good.  And it's not really a \\"guilty pleasure\\" because virtually every film critic, with the infamous exception of the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE critic, loved it and gave it highest ratings. <br /> <br />Watching KING KONG in a theater for a vast and enthralling 187 minutes, I found director/co-producer/co-writer Jackson frequently equaling the immortal 1933 classic.  The movie benefits enormously in being  a full 90 minutes longer than the original film.  There is more time at the beginning to establish Ann Darrow (an incandescent Naomi Watts) as a song and dance entertainer, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) as a playwright, and Jack Black as flamboyant director Carl Denham in 1932 Manhattan.  It takes 45 minutes or so to get the voyage underway, then another half hour to reach Skull Island in the South Seas.  In the original, the voyage starts only ten minutes in and reaches Skull Island almost as soon as the ship leaves Manhattan. <br /> <br />We are on Skull Island, in Jackson's wondrous film, for maybe an hour, long enough to have enough creature battles to please any kid at heart.  But Jackson tops the original film in humanizing Kong; he treats Ann nicely and she replies in kind.  This romance was the most satisfying romance I saw in any 2005 movie, except maybe the two gay cowboys in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, which says something awesome about movies last year!  I particularly enjoyed seeing Ann and Kong watching a sunset together from a jungle cliff plateau.  This is an immensely likeable Kong, not someone who eats villagers and throws Manhattan socialite women to the street in the 1933 version. <br /> <br />When we reach Manhattan with Kong and company, we are about 135 minutes in on a 187 minute movie with no intermission.  I remember because I needed to make a short bathroom stop during later Skull Island scenes.  That will not be a problem on home video with the pause button.  The Oscar-nominated production design and Oscar-winning visual effects of Depression era Manhattan are just stupendous here, amazingly re-created in New Zealand, Jackson's home turf.  Here he deviates a little from the original movie in having Kong be on display in a movie palace with Denham, while Jack is previewing a new play and Ann is doing song and dance in a third theater.  There is no elevated train thrown to the ground, though it is quite a sight to see Kong destroy a huge movie palace.  The movie reaches paradise when Kong and Ann go ice dancing (!) together in a snowy Central Park, then view dawn New York City together in a pink and apricot matte painting from atop the Empire State Building.  This is some of the most beautiful visual effects and production design I have ever seen. <br /> <br />I have the double disk, widescreen format DVD of KING KONG in front of me, but am basically reviewing the theatrical experience from the beautiful Century 20 movie palace near me in Daly City.  Peter Jackson's imaginative masterpiece may be even more enthralling on letterboxed DVD, and not just for a bathroom or food break pause capability.  A second disk has almost three hours of Post-Production Diaries, the history of Skull Island, and how Depression New York City was re-created mostly in New Zealand. So if you are renting this baby, figure on three nights for the double disk edition of KING KONG.  Better yet, buy this glorious film masterpiece to enjoy over and over along with the great 1933 version, depending on which vision you are in the mood for.  I prefer Jackson's 2005 vision more, and I cannot wait to see how he tops an untoppable and unequaled movie. <br />  <br /> <br />
B00005JOWT|4.0|Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is a spin master. He travels around the country defending the tobacco industry as its main spokesperson, making sure their voice is heard along with the cancer survivors, health advocates and doctors. He deserves every penny he earns. Appearing on the daytime talk show \\"Joan\\", he manages to get a 15 year old cancer victim to side with him. Appearing at his son's career day, he proves to a little girl that her mother is wrong about cigarettes. He does his job, and he does it well. Vermont Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy) proposes putting a new graphic label on all packages of cigarettes, a none-to-subtle skull and crossbones. This stirs the debate up, causing Nick to look for new alternatives. He decides to enlist the help of Hollywood to make smoking sexy again, prompting a trip to Los Angeles, to meet with the most powerful agent in town, Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe). He decides to take his son (Cameron Bright) along, for the experience.<br /><br />\\"Thank You For Smoking\\", directed by Jason Reitman, son of Ivan (\\"Ghostbusters\\", \\"Stripes\\", \\"Twins\\", \\"Junior\\") and based on the popular book by Christopher Buckley, is a very funny film.<br /><br />In \\"In the Company of Men\\", Aaron Eckhart played a despicable man, but we still enjoyed spending time with him. It says a lot for his acting ability that he was able to charm us into liking his character, despite all of his flaws and bad qualities. Nick Naylor is a variation on this theme. As he meets with various people, he works hard to convince them the tobacco industry is not evil. A large part of Nick's likeability lies in the relationship he has with his son, Joey (Cameron Bright). Joey is at an impressionable age and Nick is not above trying to persuade him that smoking and tobacco are not bad. But he realizes that as a parent, everything he says is soaked up by his son. Nick talks to Joey about the art of argument, trying to explain to him what he does for a living. But Nick's character is more than just a father. As a spokesman for Big Tobacco, he is also trying to persuade his son that what he does is not bad. He seems proud when his son seems to be learning a little too much about his father's life and job. He knows he has to be careful about what he tells his son, but he isn't above trying to slip in some backhand promotion of the industry at his son's career day or in casual conversation. It almost seems as though he is letting his own spin get the better of him.<br /><br />When he meets with his friends, Polly Bailey (Maria Bello, \\"A History of Violence\\"), the spokesperson for the alcohol industry, and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Hoechner), the spokesperson for the firearms industry, they frequently argue about whose job is tougher, based on the number of deaths caused every year. (Hint: Nick will always win this argument.) They also sit around giving each other help for their upcoming battles. For instance, Polly dreads an upcoming story by Diane Sawyer on alcohol fetal syndrome. How can she spin that? When the two friends find out Sawyer will be doing the interview, they conclude Polly is screwed. Why? Because Sawyer will hug the mother she is interviewing, getting the sympathy.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Nick walks a tightrope. He is charming, well-spoken and enjoys his job, but his job is to defend Big Tobacco, so he isn't beyond spinning the truth. Eckhart does a masterful job of making this character funny, intelligent, smarmy and evil.<br /><br />There are a lot of stand outs in the large, well-known cast. William H. Macy is hilarious as the senator from Vermont. In one scene, we watch the senator, sitting at his desk, mulling over a problem, surrounded by bottles of maple syrup and cheese figurines and advertising mascots and wearing Birkenstock sandals and thick socks, all made in his home state. Rob Lowe is very funny as the uber-agent Jeff Megall. Clearly modeled after Michael Ovitz, we get a glimpse of the character even beforewe meet him as his assistant gives Nick and his son a tour of the new, Asian-themed office, complete with Zen-garden keeper. When we meet Jeff, we realize he has taken the Asian thing way too far. Adam Brody (TV's \\"The OC\\") is very good as Jeff's hyperactive assistant. Robert Duvall makes an appearance as The Captain, the oldest surviving member of Big Tobacco and their leader. He has made a fiefdom for in himself in Winston- Salem and Nick can't help but be impressed. Sam Elliot plays the original Marlboro Man, now wracked with cancer, but not beyond considering a little payout. Katie Holmes is also very good as Heather Holloway, a reporter doing a piece on Nick. She has some complexity and guts and isn't above sleeping with someone to get some inside information. Her character is a little unexpected; sexual, ruthless, cunning.<br /><br />Director Reitman does a very good job of balancing all of these diverse characters. Each and every one could easily be the basis of a film on their own, so there is a real danger of losing some of these major personalities in the shuffle. Each character is very distinct and provides a unique part of the overall effect. With all of these well-known actors, it seems remarkable each makes a lasting impression, but they are all memorable, unique and interesting. More importantly, just about all of them are both good and bad. From Nick on down, every character realizes they are on a slippery slope and it is just a matter of how much work they put into slowing down the inevitable slide.<br /><br />Reitman also seems to have a good ear for dialogue. The arguments, conversations and debates he writes for these characters are always amusing, at the least, and quite often, hilarious. He seems to have the most fun when the three representatives from alcohol, tobacco and firearms, are sitting around at lunch, debating whose job is the toughest. But he also has fun taking pot shots at politics, the movies, education and more.<br /><br />Very often, a comedy will start off great, throwing jokes left and right, setting up characters and the story with quick shots, creating a fast momentum, causing us to miss some of the jokes because we are laughing through them. Then, the story kicks in and things slow down a bit. Hopefully, towards the end of the film, things pick up again, creating a momentum similar to the beginning. Often, films slow down too much in the middle and don't regain the momentum through the end, leaving us feeling let down, giving us a less than favorable impression of the film. \\"Smoking\\" sidesteps most of these problems, starting at a fast clip, causing us to laugh through many jokes. However, it does slow down a bit as it begins to deal with the mechanics of the story and then picks up again for the last act. Thankfully, it doesn't fall victim to its own early success and manages a fairly consistent feel through acts two and three. But the film is a little unbalanced. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just a predictable thing. It would be nice to go to a comedy and laugh your head off consistently throughout, leaving the theater exhausted. \\"Smoking\\" is very funny, well-written and well-made, but it gives us a chance to rest and recuperate.<br /><br />\\"Thank You for Smoking\\" is not really a polemic against smoking or the tobacco industry (although, there are certainly some fine jokes at the expense of both), but the main focus is on spin and how it affects many aspects of our life and how it has come to control our lives.

0553801503|5.0|A Song of Fire and Ice is probably one of, if not the best, fantasy series out there right now.  It's so good that you might want to be wary of reading it - it's one of those series where you might go crazy waiting for the next book.  I have to warn you though, this is not happy, feel-good stuff.  This guy drags you through the full emotional gamet.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|Oh, boo hoo.  We're a bunch of filthy rich millionare rock stars.  We have so many problems. Please feel sorry for us.  This moan and piss fest made me nauseous. What they should be crying about is the fact that these pus**** have put out continuous garbage since the black album.  This DVD was laughable.  It's hard to feel sorry for a drummer who has a $11 million mansion.  Anyway, I guess the current Metallica fans can relate to this pity party.  The stuff that made them strong so long ago no longer exists.  You think Cliff would've been a part of something like this?  Oh, wait, 90% of you probably don't know who that is.  I'd love to see Mustaine break his foot off in Lars' ass.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a masterpiece of a film.  Everyone involved deserves kudos for bringing this brilliant film to the screen.   <br /> <br />The Academy Awards showed Hollywood's ugly side when it did not name \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" best picture. <br /> <br />Most of the praise for this movie has gone to Heath Ledger and his brilliant performance.  However equal praise needs to go to Jake Gyllenhaal for his amazing work in this movie.  Many people have only given Jake's performance a brief mention, including Amazon editor, Mark Englehart.  Well, I say pay equal attention to Jake.  His Jack is the heart of this love story.  He is especially amazing in their final scenes.  He captures the words of Annie Proulx in their most tender scenes.  While some may think it is easier to play the less intense character, I say that is not true.  Jack's love, hurt, pain and bitterness come through in equal measure.  He says so much with his eyes it is heartbreaking.  Also, the Jack character should get attention because he is brave and is willing to live his life with the person he loves.  He is not afraid of his feelings and that is so important.  And while some think his aging job was not good, it is exactly accurate to the time period. And praise needs to go to Anne Hathaway.  While her role is not as big, it is very important and her last scene is fantastic.  Along with the wonderful Michelle Williams and her heartbreaking Alma. <br /> <br />Overall a brilliant film that deserves all the accolades and awards it has received.  Heath and Jake both make this heartbreaking and beautiful love story come to life. <br />
B000E1155E|1.0|After hearing the buzz about this in the UK magazines, how it was gonna be the next huge thing in America, and comparisons to the like of The Beatles, Oasis, Sex Pistols, etc. I was real excited to hear this.  After listening to the whole album through........I was incredibly disappointed.  Because I love rock music and like to give everything a fair chance because sometimes it takes awhile to catch on.......I listened to it a few more times only to discover that there isnt one good song on it, the band has no catchy melodies, the lead singers voice is total crap, the lyrics are nothing special, and they are not all that talented.  Honestly, the Arctic Monkeys are better suited playing bars in small cities.  If people from the UK are gonna bash American music, they better not mention this or anything new  so far this decade because they are producing just as bad, if not worse stuff than we are.  If you wanna have this album just to be part of the all of sudden popular crap indie band crowd.....this takes the cake.  If you like \\"real\\" \\"good\\" rock music check out De Nova by The Redwalls or just wait till Tom Petty or Pearl Jam's new records.
B000001ELR|5.0|Most reviewers are quick to point out that Ace wasn't on this album. Duh.  If you listen to the guitar you can tell that it's beyond his scope of playing.  That and having Eric Carr on drums heavily contribute to the this being one of KISS' greatest albums. I found Gene to be the true genius on this album.  Besides being heavy, the music is dark and sounds like something you would hear on your way down to Hell.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus does not have as many mind blowing songs as Aenima in my opinion.  Yes, all the songs are very complex and definitely masterpieces, but there's a few that just do not resonate with me, compared to Every song on Aenima resonating with me.   <br /> <br />That being said, the songs that do resonate are worth any price, and put this album so far beyond the best offerings of most bands.  I had the luck to get tickets to the Chicago show they performed right after the album came out (1 of 4 shows in small venues in the US, compared to the larger US tour they performed after a European tour I believe).  They ended the show with Lateralus, and hearing that wrap up the show is something that I will never forget.  Everyone there was just listening; hardly any movement, maybe a few people mouthing the words.  With music this heavy you might expect some moshing or arms pumping along, but this music, all you can do is 'suck it in'.  Best show ever I've been to, and I don't expect to ever go to a better show, except possibly another Tool show.   <br /> <br />\\"Spiral out. Keep going.\\"
B00005JO20|5.0|Peter Jackson's King Kong is about a film producer/director named Carl Denham and his crew's adventure on a mysterious island. They travel to Skull Island to shoot a new film, but when they find out a legendary beast and dangerous natives live on the island, their quest and curiosity puts them against Kong, the natives, and his dinosaur enemies, and while the crew attempt to catch the legendary creature, Kong's attention is captivated by a beautiful woman named Ann Darrow, which allows for the explorers to capture him and bring him to New York, where Kong's future involves commercial exploitation.<br /><br />My fave scene from the film is *SPOILERS* where Kong is fighting the dinosaurs, and he rips one of their heads in two, and the jaw dangles. *END OF SPOILERS*. It's just so random that Kong makes it's jaw dangle, that it's hilarious! If you love special effects, you MUST see this film! The stampede sequence alone will leave your jaw dropping, and Kong looks excellent! The ending left much to be desired, but it's still a good ending. After seeing this for the first time, I wish I saw it in theatres!<br /><br />King Kong is the best remake I've ever seen thus far (and I am not a fan of remakes), and one of the best films of 2005. The three hour length of the film flew by, I didn't even notice how long the film is. My eyes were glued to the screen. I think this is Peter Jackson's best film thus far, I'm not a fan of the LotR trilogy, but I've seen most of his other films, and this tops them all. If you're looking for action, adventure, or an excellent love story, you'll definitely do yourself a favor by checking out \\"King Kong\\".
630026999X|5.0|I love this move, I've seen it dozens of times and I love it every time. It's directed by George Ramero and written by stephan King...that right there should tell you it's goign to be a lot of fun to watch. it's a movie of 5 short tales of terror....honestly though, unless you're 8 years old, it's not scary. the lighting, backdrops, as well as the borders give the movie a look of a \\"living comic book\\" <br /> <br />Father's Day-- a murdered father comes back for revenge from the grave. <br /> <br />Something to tide you over--- Leslie Nielson and Ted Danson star in this tale of a jealous hubby getting revenge on his cheating wife and her lover by burying them up to their necks in sand, letting them drown...can you hold your breath? <br /> <br />It Grows on you--Stephan King stars in this tale of a simple man who has a meteor fall in his yard and develops a...ahem..weed problem....this is one of my favorites <br /> <br />The Crate--- a monster found under a stairway of a college prompts a man to murder his wife that he hates.. <br /> <br />They Creep Up On You--- an old rich man has a bit of a bug problem <br /> <br /> <br />I loved this film....it's not for everyone, but if you're into classic horror films, give it a try...you'll like it
B000E97HIA|5.0|I'm leery of the hype of this record as a return to 80s form, for the simple reason that Prince has never stopped recording and releasing outstanding music, never stopped evolving. Rainbow Children and the One Night Alone piano record, for example, are both fine records he's released within the past 5 years, and while his work may have lost consistency in the 90s, that was largely because he was putting out so much of it, not due to a decline in the quality of the best of it.  The peaks were as high as always.<br /><br />But indeed 3121 does hearken back to his classic middle-80s period, the run from Purple Rain through Sign O' the Times, when the music was as colorful as it ever was, and when Prince painted with his broadest palate.  Here we combine the usual rock-solid funk, that glorious colorful music, and modern recording technology; this last point keeps the record from sounding like it was recorded back in the day, which is to say, it does not sound dated.  What we have here, basically, is a fresh and vibrant album that evokes the color and style of Prince's most prolific, best-loved era.<br /><br />3121 is a return to a particular sound, style of work.  The vocals are rich and layered, with a heavy sense of female presence (sometimes Tamar, sometimes Prince himself); the instrumental backing is invigorating and creative and lush, and the playing, as if this even needs to be said, is right in the pocket.  Something about this music sounds \\"revolutionary\\" (wink, wink.)  And it can't be a coincidence that recently he has played live with Wendy, Lisa and Sheila E.<br /><br />I'd swear that was the old Prince alter ego Camille singing with him on this opening track \\"3121,\\" a song that merges the insistent prince funk with the sonic colors of his mid-80s work, both released and unreleased.  Dream Factory anyone?<br /><br />\\"Lolita\\" is a naughty call-and-response that invokes the Lovesexy album.  \\"Te Amo Corazon\\" has gotten some lead play as a single, and it is smooth and easy on the ears, a little bit of Latin cool with lush orchestration and some tasteful Prince guitar.<br /><br />\\"Black Sweat\\" is a funk groove that sounds a little like \\"Kiss,\\" except that it stays on the one chord.  Prince plays every instrument on this and several other tracks, and you can hear it.  However, Prince (along with Todd Rundgren and Stevie Wonder) is one of the few musicians who has a distinct and articulate voice as a one-man studio band.  He plays all the instruments, and he plays the studio.<br /><br />\\"Incense and Candles\\" is a breezy and confident piece that erupts into a sweet vocal burst at the end.  \\"Love\\" is a tasty poppy trifle (a good thing) with funk guitar chords, burping synths, and handclaps, but at precisely 4:20 Prince says, \\"Let's skate,\\" and the song flips over into a sweaty funk stomp, suddenly nasty, an extended playout that vaguely evokes \\"Le Freak.\\"  Both these two songs are all Prince, save for prot&eacute;g&eacute; Tamar on vocals.  (After catching the Tamar gig featuring Prince at Nokia in NYC, I've already wishlisted the upcoming Tamar record.)<br /><br />\\"Satisfied\\" is one of those falsetto Prince love song testimonies (e.g., \\"Slow Love\\"), and you know what I mean, and it'll give you chills; here the horn section is added to the mix.  \\"Fury\\" is instantly recognizable as a Prince rocker, lush fervent keyboards laying out the groove, Prince's rock God guitar searing over the top.  \\"The Word\\" hasn't yet grabbed me, although yet again, nice guitar work.  But next up is the sublime \\"Beautiful, Loved and Blessed,\\" his duet with Tamar, which can only be described as old school soul of the very finest kind.  Just note-perfect from beginning to end.<br /><br />\\"Dance\\" is a pleading, sad, haunting eminently listenable minor key tune that (a signature move) goes major on the chorus; like most of the record, just Prince on the track.<br /><br />The final track, \\"Get on the Boat,\\" is a classic old school funk workout featuring apercolating drum and percussion section, and the stellar Maceo Parker on horn.  This is a funk played live, not machine-made; the sound is different from much of the record because it features a full band.  The brassy horn section and Latin groove of the percussion make this one feel like a dance party in your head.<br /><br />I liked Musicology; and I really liked One Night Alone (the solo piano thing) and Rainbow Children.  It is hard to be sure this soon, but I think this will wear as the most enduring and consistent Prince record since Sign O' the Times.<br /><br />So maybe it IS a return to something.ng a percolating drum and percussion section, and the stellar Maceo Parker on horn.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|I've seen thousands of movies, but this incredibly made movie from a simple story of love transcends all boundaries.  This movie is dedicated to all of us who have loved someone in our lives who we couldn't have or show how we truly felt.  There are no walls up in this movie.  That's a first.  Truly powerful, touching, beautiful.  The only tragedy is that it was snubbed by the Oscars for a much lesser film, even though it had won best picture from all of the dozens of other award shows and film critics.  Get this DVD.  This is a historic movie.  Can't say that about any of the other ones released in recent memory.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|Rent is of course a fabulous movie...I ordered it and it took a little while longer than I had hoped for it to arrive, but it arrived in great condition and I love it! Thanks!
0739307312|4.0|the audio version, unabridged of course. If you plan to see the movie, reading the 454 page thriller would be a task, unless you have lots of time. It's pretty dense. The cassette moved quickly & you can always rewind. Lots of intricate plot twists & turns with the sneaking hunch that some of it may be true. There are revelations about the mother church that disturb some Catholics, & they condemn this book. Yeah, that will really slow down sales won't it? It's  valuable for secularist also. It's a really thrilling story. Starting with a murder in the Lourve in Paris that brings out all sorts of plots & subplots. Historical questions are raised that would interest most literate people, such as the possiblity that Jesus Christ married, had a daughter & thus may have descendants to this very day. Who is the Mona Lisa? Maybe Da Vinci in drag? Lots of stories for the history buff on Da Vinci's work, the Knights Templar, the location & the earthly remains of the Virgin Mary etc. She had a history after Christ,s birth & so much more. Too much to cram into one small review. Listen to the tape & review it here. I hope the movie does it justice.
B00009V7P8|4.0|I think this is a very, very good album. I did not put it in my vault of all-time greats, but it is worth writing about for several reasons. <br /> <br />In our world of manufactured bands, American Idol pop-culture capitalism and hi-tech sound generators, what we do have in Damien Rice is an artist who did not compose these songs, or write these lyrics with fame or revenue in mind. This is an artist who wrote and performed from what was (and is) truly the essence of his inner-self. He prepared his music without care for what the listener was going to like. Damien Rice on this CD is so strikingly accurate to his emotion that you get the sense he is not using his voice to sing with, but rather his heart to convey with. This is the type of talent we need to reserve the title \\"Artist\\" for, instead of randomly smattering it around as applied to anyone who picks up a microphone or a 6-string. The word \\"soul\\" is reborn on this CD as to what it should also; someone singing from the soul. I feel his pains and his angst on each track. Some listeners prefer not to feel these things as a result of a song, but if a song is put out there that is  powerful enough to do this, ....well, it is an exceptional work. <br /> <br />Damien, stay true to the way you put this work togther. You are a lone survivor left to carry on the true art of talented expression. I cannot listen to one more bass/drum computerized track, backing some trendy punk who is doing his best to make his mark on \\"cool\\". You have proven with this album that there are those of us out there who appreciate true music stylings.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I love this movie. It is a great love story that happened in the wrong place at the wrong time (cowboy country in the 60s). Everything about this movie is great. I cannot wait to own a copy.
B000002JOH|5.0|Its safe to assume that a Pantera fan kicked one of your balls into outter space which is why you resent this band.. For you to be thankfull of Dimebag Darrell Abbot's murder is inexcusable under any circumstances. That just shows how immature and stupid you are. Find some common sense before you write a review.. Dimebag created some of the most powerfull and rythemic riffs in metal history.. He took all of his predecessors influencal guitar riffs and refined it to a new aggressive level that happens to be very musical. There hasnt been a metal guitarist that can match Dimebags guitar intensity.    As far as the songs on this particular album go, \\"Walk\\" had a very distinct tempo from any other metal song ever made, It actually lacks an aggressive guitar tone however, the tempo and timing creates an empowering attitude. If Dimebag wasnt a talented guitarist, he would not have been able to create this effect. \\"Mouth of War\\" another great song with fast riffs and change over tempos Along with Phil's great vocals that he puts all his heart and energy into. \\"F'n hostile\\" A subtle beggining transforming into a heavey rythemic song... \\"This Love\\".. Starting out with a melodic strum and then gradually forming into an aggressive chorus. The second Chorus alternates into an extended version with changing notes which exudes a more powerfull emotion to the listener...  For any moron to discredit this Band as caveman music is someone that is close minded to good musicianship. By the way, if you want to listen to caveman music which lacks originality then go listen to Dream Theater.

B000E97Y6K|2.0|Some thoughts:    - It is possible for a movie to have too many dinosaurs. Who would have thought?    - Jackson's command of spectacle is immature. He got away with it in the first two LORD OF THE RINGS films because Tolkien's story and characters were so powerful. But cracks of obvious indulgence appeared in RETURN OF THE KING, and they open into a yawning chasm in KONG. (Literally, yawning.) Spielberg fell into the same trap with 1941.    - Digital special effects have lost their magic. This isn't entirely Jackson's fault, but KONG makes it painfully obvious. Anything that can be imagined can be now shown. The question is, who has the talent to imagine something fresh and new?
B00004XPPK|4.0|I'm 37 years old and far from an old time movie buff.  I like noir movies though and have started collecting them for a while now.  I also managed to get this movie for $9.99 at Tower Records because somebody goofed and put the wrong price on it, it was supposed to be $19.99.  BONUS!!! <br />I've seen some sexy performances in my day from older actresses (Liz Taylor in 'Cat on a hot tin roof', Grace Kelly in 'Rear Window' to name a couple).  But MAN 'O MAN was Rita Hayworth gorgeous in this movie.  It is impossible to take your eyes off her.  She showed a lot of emotions and range in her role, and throughout the movie I kept thinking to myself \\"I don't know what she did to tick-off Glenn Ford, but it must've been really, REALLY bad\\" because his character showed great restraint to her tempting ways (which are rampant throughout the whole movie).  Easily THEE sexiest role I have ever seen, regardless of day and age.  The story is a little hard to follow (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars), but it doesn't really matter because even if you could follow it, you'd be too distracted by Hayworth's performance and beauty anyway. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00029LNHS|5.0|I just got this and I really like it, especially track 5 - Shut Up. It's a nice mix and the CD isn't about pimping and gangsta stuff like all the other stuff out there.  <br /> <br />Highly Recommended!
B000ENWKN8|5.0|I've been listenin to Zombie for about 5 years now and he's always been a favorite of mine,in my mind my favorite album from him will always be \\"Astrocreep 2000\\", these songs remind me more of the 2 tracks off his greatest hits album \\"Two Lane Blacktop and Girl on Fire\\", it's not so much fist-pumpin, ass-kickin, white knuckle metal that \\"Astrocreep\\" was and the industrial feel of \\"Hellbilly Deluxe\\" is gone too,it's just a hard rock album and i feel it's able to hold it's own in the zombie catalogue. while i do admit that it will take a little while for it to grow on me i don't hate it!it's a kickass cd all it's own!Rob Zombie has matured and it sounds great!i'll always support Zombie in anything he puts out....and the next movie \\"El Superbeasto\\" looks great!can't wait to see it!
B00005JOE8|5.0|Riveting, wonderful, thought provoking entertainment!  Finally, a movie that satisfies and offers an eye opening view of what can happen to a nation whose people become complacent and excessively obedient when they are cowed into being afraid and think, as the government propaganda intends, that only the head of state can protect them and there in lies his control over them.  The acting was excellent and there were no gratuitous sex scenes.  What a refreshing thing that is. <br />The movie gave me hope that a hero type character (V) can awake people from their stupor to rebel against an oppressive, spying, greedy, power seeking government.  \\"People should not fear their government, governments should fear their people\\". <br />One of the best movies I have seen in awhile.
0800196341|5.0|So much has been written, I'll be brief.  This is a fabulous version of Hamlet.  Beautifully shot, well-acted, and complete in its scope.  While certain other film versions of this classic play are wonderful in their own right, this version of Hamlet captures the full-ness of the play, with all its subplots and variations.  Everyone should see it.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|In his most personal work yet, David Gilmour delivers everything that you would expect from such a legendary artist. Searing guitar solos, mesmerizing vocals and a Pink Floydish sound that is unmatched by any other artist. This latest work harkens back to Meddle and Obscured days of the past and touches a chord that only David can reach. From amazingly moving pieces like \\"on An Island\\" and \\"Blue\\" to his haunting instrumentals, David exposes his inner most self and growing maturity in this wonderful work. <br /> <br />The lyrics are only average however which keeps this from reaching 5 stars for me. But in the end, the music is always what has moved us the most about David's music and much more is said in a single guitar phrase than can ever be put into words. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of David or of the slower more melodic Floyd work, it is well worth the purchase. <br /> <br />By the way, for all of those who somehow think Roger Waters wrote all of the best Floyd music, I just have a few words....Echoes, One of these Days, Breathe, Time, Wish You Were Here, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Dogs, Young Lust, Run Like Hell, Comfortably Numb. Both Roger AND David are PINK. Give them both their proper due.  <br /> <br />Rich <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004TH83|5.0|It is hard to decide which English album is her best, Lara Fabian (2000) or Wonderful Life (2004). Her first album, did of course, produce the smashing hit I Will Love Again, which makes this album in my books her best English album ever. Adagio illustrates her vocal and song-writing excellence. I Am Who I Am shows us a more funky approach, opposed to the calm atmosphere Adagio creates. This album also features the English version of Si Tu M'Aimes, To Love Again and a song from the Dawson Creek soundtrack, Givin' Up On You. This album is characterised by wonderful melodies, beautiful lyrics and Lara's powerful vocal trademark. A must for every fan, especially English fans.

1400032717|3.0|I hate to give this book a bad review because of all the good ones, but unless you want to read what an autistic child thinks on a daily basis you will be disappointed.  The book did not keep my interest, was repetitive and lacked a good plot.  I struggled to finish it and was frustrated when I did.  There was no good conclusion and nothing really came out of the story.
B00004W510|5.0|One reviewer questions whether The Band can be appreciated by people born not in the 50's and 60's. That is absurd. I was born in 1950 and enjoyed the Band immensely in the early 70's, attending 9 concerts in several different locations in Southern California, including the storied outdoor bowl in Santa Barabara where they started their concert before the sun went down; it was an unseasonably hot day in Santa Barbara, but an unforgettable one because of the music blowing up Santa Barbara's rather steep outdoor bowl and careening out into the evening sky.<br /><br />I have played their music continually and frequently for the past 35 years, even though my tastes have changed dramatically to classical music. The Band persists.<br /><br />My 18 year-old son and a couple of his local pals love their music and he even tries to interest his college friends in their music. Timeless music is a cliche, but when the Band was recording albums and playing live, it was very unique, especially in that era of rock n roll--it is unique in any era, I would argue.<br /><br />I have this album, but since I also own To Kingdom Come, the ultimate Band album, and Stage Fright (and all their other albums) I play this album infrequently, but still enjoy it. It is interesting to read about other listener's favorite Band songs, some of which I like a lot, others seem second or third tier. It just shows you how universal their music is.<br /><br />The tragedy is that they broke up too soon, a fact that R. Robertson finally acknowledged sometime in the 90's, since he broke up the group. Nevertheless, we are left with many great songs from one of the several essential rock n roll bands of all time.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Updated: The &#34;new&#34; Blu-Ray is, essentially, just a straight reissue of the previous edition. The transfer and extras are the same as the previous deluxe edition and the timing is to coincide with &#34;Kong:Skull Island&#34; which can't be a prequel bexause it is set AFTER the Jackson film chronologically (I.e., it takes place &#34;now&#34; whereas the Jackson film was set in the 30's like the original film).<br /><br />The previous Blu-Ray feature a very nice looking and sounding transfer with a host of extras.<br /><br />Back to the original review:<br /><br />Peter Jackson's epic retelling of &#34;King Kong&#34; may run a bit too long at nearly 3 hours but it's an admirable and fun adventure well worth taking. Filled with wonderous Oscar winning visual effects, &#34;Kong&#34; is, indeed, the 8th Wonder of the World in this marvelous movie. Jackson manages to recreate the world of 1933 New York perfectly in this rollicking roller coaster of an adventure. Like the original 1933 classic Jackson and his crew of visual effects artists (along with a strong cast)give &#34;Kong&#34; a sense of reality even as we see all the fantastic events in the film. By the way the dialogue scene where they are shooting the &#34;movie&#34; on the boat with Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler who has a lot of fun with the role) is taken directly from the original 1933 &#34;King Kong&#34;.<br /><br /> Carl Denham (Jack Black &#34;School of Rock&#34;) a producer about to be arrested by people who invested in his only partially finished movie receives a map leading to a previously uncharted island--Skull Island. He hopes to take his new leading lady Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts &#34;The Ring&#34;) a down on her luck actress to the island to shoot a script by famous playwrite  Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody of &#34;The Jacket&#34; and &#34;The Pianist&#34;). Denham and his crew aren't quite ready for the dangerous natives of Skull Island or the giant 35 foot tall Silverback Gorilla--Kong--that the natives plan on sacrificing to Kong. Now it's up to Driscoll and the crew of the ship to fight dinosaurs, giant bugs and their the island itself to try and save Darrow. Denham has a crazy idea when he loses the reels to his film--he'll bring Kong back to New York where he'll make millions (&#34;I'll share it all with you boys&#34;).<br /><br />The DVD looks marvelous with a faithful reproduction of the original theatrical exhibition. No doubt this version will be superceded by the HD-DVD edition when it comes out later in the year or even the multi-disc set planned for November (reportedly even longer than this edition). I don't know how much more story Jackson has to tell with &#34;Kong&#34; but this edition of the film more than fits the bill when it comes to entertainment.<br /><br />The 2 disc edition is the one to get if you enjoy extras. We get an introduction by Jackson discussing the film and how the 1933 original inspired him to become a filmmaker so, in many respects, this is his chance to pay the makers of that film back. We also get &#34;Post-Production Diaries&#34; most of which were originally on the website for &#34;Kong&#34; providing a glimpse behind-the-scenes in the visual effects and other effects created for the film. &#34;Kong's New York, 1933 feature a discussion of the importance that vaudeville and other entertainment played in distracting a city in the middle of the depression. We also hear about the skycraper boom and the Empire State Building construction all of which helped the city's inhabitants earn a living during a difficult time in our history. &#34;Skull Island-A Natural History&#34; is a tongue-in-cheek look at the &#34;real&#34; Skull Island. It's very much in the vein of his fictional documentary &#34;Forgotten Silver&#34; and is a treat.<br /><br />While there isn't a commentary track for the film (we'll get that on the deluxe edition in November), the extras included here are a lot of fun to go through. This is definitely worthwhile. Is it better than the 1933 original film or the 1977 remake? That's up to you to decide but Jackson makes a memorable contemporary update of Kong retelling the story for a modern audience while staying true to the film's roots.That's up to you to decide but Jackson makes a memorable contemporary update of Kong retelling the story for a modern audience while staying true to the film's roots.
0156027321|4.0|I have to admit that I really did have a difficult time getting into this book at first. However, after I did it developed into an exquisite story! You can almost see, taste, hear, smell what's happening. Well worth the effort.
B000E8QVWY|2.0|I will start by saying that I am not a great fan of country music or the music of Johnny Cash. If you love one or both you will probably enjoy the film. If you want to see a great movie..the two stars hold. The reason I viewed it was because I like a well done biography regardless of the genre or subject matter. Unfortunately, I found that this one lacks any major points of interest. Like hundreds of other famous men, Cash had trouble with women and much of it was his own fault. He got invovled with drugs, recovered, and then married the girl of his dreams. A nice love story but hardly enough to engage an audience for two hours. The movie could have done more with the theme. Both he and Loretta made a huge impact on country music. This movie failed to reflect on that larger context beyond showing screaming fans. In the end it is simply a love story that we have all seen before. To make matters worse, this movie doesn't just feature cuts from his songs, it is largely made up of performances interspersed with acting. While they do use a few songs to illustrate how Johnny and Loretta related on stage, this device seems just that...a device to allow us to hear his music while not completely forgetting about acting. In the end what sticks most strongly in my mind is how similar the melody of the songs were with the same foot thumping bass line at the core of each one. When songs go on so long that you wonder where the movie went you begin to think that the writer ran out of material. Personally, I had to struggle to stay awake for the second half.
B00006FM77|4.0|I can still remember when I first brought this 4 disc LP home. I tore off the cellophane and popped record one on my trusty Dual turntable. I had already heard Chicago perform live 5 or 6 times and I thought I knew what to expect. After all, they could ROCK! Were my expectations correct? No! Or maybe. Sort of.  Although the performance was by and large a success, the recording was a flat out disaster--or so I thought. I also believed that the recording engineers, mixers, producers, et al, should never be allowed to work again. Ah,to be young.  Looking back at it now though, I have realized that the recording was about as close to \\"state of the art\\" as could possibly be hoped for. (Although that said, the \\"Live in Japan\\" album is a much better sounding record).  The concerts themselves were about as accurate a reflection of what a Chicago concert was all about at the time. Wild, raw, full of energy and passion. Some stunning solos. And a new piece was introduced on the album \\"A song for Richard and his friends\\". As Robert Lamm said, it is a song about \\"Wishing President Nixon would quit\\". That would happen soon enough. Who knows, maybe we now need a song about our current President.  Anyway, this is a classic period piece. I would not recomend it to anyone as an introduction to Chicago, but if you are a fan, this is a must have.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|I'll keep this short and sweet since, while I think this album was excellent, I don't view \\"The Battle of Los Angeles\\" to be the band's finest work.  I think that's a toss-up between their debut and the nigh-perfect \\"Evil Empire.\\"  This band told it like it was, is, and will likely, unfortunately, continue to be each and every time they released an album. <br /> <br />However, this one digs into the band's favorite topics a little deeper and what it uncovers is hideous and depressing.  From songs ranging about the destitution-to-desperation of the poor in Mexico (\\"Maria\\") to the us-against-them nature of abandoned/forgotten ethic groups/gangs in the inner city (\\"Born As Ghosts\\") to a song about one of their biggest causes, the freedom of (perhaps wrongly) convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal and other so-called criminals that may be in the same boat (\\"Voice of the Voiceless\\"), this album doesn't relent until the CD ends. <br /> <br />However, the one track that has always stuck out in my mind as the glimpse behind the curtain to which all others should be compared is the masterful \\"Ashes in the Fall,\\" perhaps the band's most gut-wrenching, soul-searing track in its entire career. <br /> <br />The song takes an unflinching look at poverty and the plight of the lower class, immigrants and homeless: the very people that the government should be taking care of that it instead allows to fend for themselves.  Starving, desperate, abused, and neglected, these people see no other way out of their situation than resorting to violence and crime...actions for which they are arrested and imprisoned, if not killed outright.  The song's most gripping moment is when Zach de la Rocha mockingly screams, \\"Ain't it funny how the factory doors close 'round the time that the school doors close? 'Round the time that the doors of the jail cell open up to greet you like the Reaper?\\"  <br /> <br />In other words, while most children are entering/leaving school, the pvverty-stricken are walking into factories where they can be promised low wages and grueling work until the whistle blows.  If not that, then finding trouble and expending what little life is left inside them in the confines of a prison cell.  It is a bleak image and all too true in the darker corners of every city in the United States. <br /> <br />As others have said, the reference to the new sound being just like the old sound is a snide reminder to the listener that the grandiose speeches of the government's appointed representatives are just echoes of all that was said by those who came before them.  And all the while, a voice can be heard in the undercurrent calling for the expulsion of all \\"non-natives\\" in favor of the so-called \\"chosen\\" people of God, a direct contradiction to everything the founders of the nation believed it should be about, according to the Constitution. <br /> <br />It is an exceptional song on the strength of its lyrics alone, but the band truly outdid itself with the music, from the high-pitched cry of the guitar to the soft rhthym of the bass during the build to the song's final crescendo. <br /> <br />I don't know if there's a human being that can listen to this song and not feel his or her soul quail in horror at the images it creates.  If such a person exists, I hope we never meet.
B000E6ESL2|1.0|For some reason this really devastatingly horrible film has some kind of following starting to form. It's a group of people that for one haven't seen a little movie named \\"Mulholland Drive\\", and think that because you like this movie you are, per se, 'intelligent'. I say this because the most frequent attack I hear in an arguement over this movie is 'You didn't like it because you didn't understand it; because you were confused'.  <br /> <br />Not true, I understood it, I understood it quite well. If you're watching this because you're waiting for the next big 'cult' film since \\"Donnie Darko\\", pass; or if you're watching it because that guy off \\"The Notebook\\" is a main, pass. Because folks, this movie is truely horrible.  <br /> <br />There is only one good thing about it, the cinematography. In my opinion, this is one of the most pretentious movies of all time.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|I think a testament to just how an artist or work affects you is that throughout your life, you'll hear a song on the radio, or recall a few notes from a past favourite and you get this deep yearning to rediscover the soundtrack from that time in your life.  <br /> <br />You go to your CD (or tape, or vinyl!) collection and realise you no longer have the album.. what do you do? Go out and buy it again. Listen to it on a loop for a few weeks and put it in the collection with its brothers, vowing not to let it go missing again. <br /> <br />In the 17 years that I've been a Floyd and Gilmour fan, I have purchased and repurchased The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, Atom Heart Mother, Animals, Wish You Were Here, About Face (to name a handful), several times each.  <br /> <br />I bought On an Island yesterday, and I have listened to it just once so far. Being a fan but knowing that I shouldn't have had expectations of another Floyd album, I nonetheless wanted to be blown away and at the very least expected one or two sparks. I don't believe an album needs to be heavy or upbeat to get me interested.. just musically and/or lyrically 'eventful'. Some darkness, some brightness, some depth and some texture. <br /> <br />However, from track to track I found myself waiting for something to happen. Not something big, just.. something. Like the iconic cover image, I sat on the island, some birds flew overhead, water lapped at the shore.. and it was over.  <br /> <br />When track 10 finished, I didn't really have an urge to listen to any particular track again. I quite liked the opening instrumental and the title track. 'Take a Breath' did grab my attention, and I turned up the volume. <br /> <br />I have no doubt that the album will grow on me with each listen but, if in 5 years I notice it's missing from my collection, right now I couldn't say for sure that I'll repurchase On an Island.
0767805712|5.0|\\"Gattaca\\" is what could be the most uplifiting movie of all time. Ethan Hawke is a wonderful lead, while Jude Law (not being in much) does a great job too. The writing is great, not really much else to say. <br /> <br />The characters are realistic; the writing is superb. What I really like about \\"Gattaca\\" is that while the whole movie is about a murder, the movie barely focuses on it. My feelings and thoughts toward it are very hard to explain. <br /> <br />So, basically, it's an amazing movie, and very underrated. At least rent it. <br /> <br />Hopefully, I helped somehow....
B000E97Y6K|4.0|I bought this DVD for my 8 year old son who is King Kong crazy. The show didnt hold his attention until Kong actually came into the picture. The movie is over three hours long and Kong comes into the movie  about an hour and a half into it. The movie on an adult level was good. There were some boring parts as with any movie but the special FX and scenes were well made and awesome. I would recommend this movie to any Kong fan.If your not a kong fan i would still watch it for the storyline and special effects alone.
0553573403|4.0|A number of the criticisms of this series may have some truth, but lets give credit where its due, the man can really tell a story. Yes, there is some corniness and cliched writing, but this author has accomplished something few can pull off, transforming a complex vision complete with centuries of invented historical background into an immense tale people actually want to read. The more outre elements here aren't really out of place, almost a time honored tradition (anyone remember the perverse imperials of Dune?). I'm about halfway through the first book, and I say -lead on Mr. Martin, grand dungeon master extraordinaire.
B000066C4V|5.0|This is one of Robert Altman's better films and falls into a more traditional category of filmmaking but with many of his unique touches for character development pointing out the prominent idiosyncrasies of the members of his ensemble. Good performances do abound and the methodical plot moves ever so surreptitiously and comes to some very interesting revelations. This film seems to have grown much better with time proving that reflection is a good thing.
0679746048|4.0|This book offers incredible insight into the depth of despair and desperation that those who have a mental illness have to endure.  It is honest, heart wrenching, sad, and yet it is also  very interesting and insightful.  The book gives hope to those who suffer from mental problems, it offers enlightenent to those of us who haven't been affected directly by these problems, and it gives everyone an accurate historical account of what psychiatry, psychology, and medicine were like in the late 1960s.<br /><br />The books is very well written.  Kaysen's observations are candid and fascinating.  Her very analytical intellectualized account of what it is like to experience two years in a mental institution follows her own experience and also outlines the experiences of those who were also fighting their own mental battles.<br /><br />An excellent book - I highly recommend it.
0670033375|4.0|Diamond's basic point is that societies have collapsed in the past when their resource usage outstrips their resource supply.  If the supply of resources is suddenly cut off, as is often the case, then the societal collapse can occur very rapidly.  It is often a surprise to the participants because the resource supply and demand lines cross right at the historical peak in a societies growth curve. <br /> <br />This makes perfect sense to me. <br /> <br />Diamond also points out that our global usage of supplies is on a collision course over the next 50 years with our globally available resources.  Basically, global population is expected to double over the next 50 years, and the per capital standard of living (first world standards of living being more resource-intense than third world standards of living) is also expected to double.  Two time two equals four, and the resulting expectation of a four fold increase in global resource usage seems impossible to Diamond, given our current global resource usage. <br /> <br />Again, Diamond's argument seems almost irrefutable. <br /> <br />The only mitigating factor is technology.  Will technology improve over the next 50 years to the extent that this four fold growth in resource demand can be accommodated?  Diamond thinks not, and here is the only area where I think Diamond's prognostication can be challenged.  Diamond has a very different view of technology than most thinkers.  For him, new technology is the gradual accumulation of many little discoveries.  It takes a long, long time for a meaningful new technology to be developed and implemented. <br /> <br />This view is quite different from the view that new technology comes upon us as an explosive new process, lending dramatically increased productivity.  I think Thomas Kuhns' \\"Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\\" Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Tipping Point,\\" and every history course I ever took would support this latter view. <br /> <br />Diamond is convincing, however, andI think his thesis is supported by what we're seeing in oil prices lately.  As a society, we in the US should prepare to transition from a growth culture (where raw materials are under-utilized and readily available) to a stable culture (where societal success comes from balancing our resource usage with our available resources). <br /> <br />This certainly gives a new perspective on the current immigration debate.  How can the US as a country allow illegal immigration to continue?  If we are struggling to successfully balance our resource usage with our available resources, rather than focusing on growth through the use of readily available excess resources, we as a country have got to stop illegal immigration. <br /> <br />I am a bit amused by this conclusion, as I believe that Diamond would try to weasel out of it -- its not politically correct enough for him.  This is a good example, however, of a society needing to change a basic social tenet (the US was built on immigrants) in order to survive. <br />

Everything from the lighting, to costumes, to the writing was flawless. V is a modern day hero, one that we all need to become. Listen and apply it to what is happening right now, and you will walk out feeling empowered and enlightened. That, and V is totally hot;)
0671578855|3.0|A Civil Campaign is basically A Comedy of Errors set in the Vorkorsigan universe.  This book follows Miles through as he bumbles through an awkward courtship of Ekaterian and the usual cast of characters abound.  Bujold plays to her strenghts here in various fashions.  The book has more absurdist English wit then previous entries and is laugh out funny in many points.  Bujold's charactarization shines as she makes Ekatarian a strong female character who can almost hold her own in a large role opposite the amazing Miles.  Even though this is like the 9th entry into the series, Bujold finds ways to keep Miles interesting and develop his character.  Finally, even though the ending is inevitable, Bujold still manages to build some level of suspense and anxiety to the outcome. <br /> <br />Like other books in the series, Bujold has something to say about physical limitations, the importance of the mind, and the power of charsima.  Perhaps this is why she has been so popular with sci-fi dorks around the world.  Also like other books in this series, you need to start at the beginning as one could never understand all the nuances, inside jokes and refrences found within this book. <br /> <br />I agree with another reviewer regarding the cover.  It is probably a gross inaccuracy of Miles physical description although if one is willing to suspend logical thought, they might that argue that the cover models are just random dancers and not the primary characters.  Regardless, one should never judge a book by its cover.   <br /> <br />This book was nominated for the Hugo in 2000 and the Nebula in 2001 in what was an exceptionally stong year.  In retrospect this book can't really compare in scope or originality to Vinge's Hugo win for A Deepness In the Sky, (also nominated for Nebula) but the two books are so different that its like comparing apples and oranges. Other Hugo nominees from that year also included Darwin's Radio (Nebula winner), Cryptnomicon and Harry Potter III...all \\"heavy hitters\\". <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  A fine late entry into a series.  Readers who have made it this far probably won't stop here.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|OK, intellectually I *know* Highway 61 is supposed to be the best Dylan album.  But *this* is the Dylan album that spent the most time on my turntable, in my cassette player, and in my CD player these last 20+ years.  It's just too compelling.  And Blonde on Blonde is not in the same league as Highway 61 and Blood on the Tracks.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Kong Rules, Peter Jackson has created something that is priceless.<br /><br />The action was non stop, besides that Kong was so lifelike, that he won me over. There is nothing like a film full of life and real emotion. The Best film I've saw in since LOTR and Crash.

I was ready for this, really hitting bottom emotionally, but knowing there is purpose for living another day; I always regected organized religion for spiritual direction and without getting too heavy Eckhart speaks in terms that does not make my stomach knot up when he does speak of religious philosophies such as Zen Buddhism and Christianity strictly for the purpose of understanding yourself and getting a handle on your situation, I very much recommend this. Right up there with \\"The Four Agreements\\" another must read for living a peaceful and meaningful life. Good luck to all, you are worth the investment!
B000002J09|5.0|Ok I know its cliche to praise this album but I can't just help myself.  Although not my favorite Zep album it stands next to Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" as one of the quintessential seventies rock albums.  What makes this album so great is how it fully display's Zeppelin's power at its mightiest.  Beginning with the hard rock staple \\"Black Dog\\" and ending with the Bonzo thunder of \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" this album is an epic experience. <br />\\"Black Dog\\" features alternating Plant acapella with some of the hardest hitting ensemble playing to be ever put on record. <br />\\"Rock and Roll\\" is a rollicking fifties style rocker also featuring Zep's ensemble prowess. <br />\\"The Battle of Evermore,\\" is the album's underrated classic.  It is a dark mandolin driven tune featuring some haunting harmony vocals courtesy of Sandy Denny.  This tune comes complete with some trademark Zeppelin \\"Lord of the Rings\\" refrences.  \\"...The ring wraiths ride in black...\\" <br />\\"Stairway to Heaven\\" needs no elaboration.  Everyone knows its the most played song on classic rock radio.  It is undisputed as one of the greatest songs in rock history.  Beginning as a delicate acoustic piece the song erupts into a full blown tornado of guitar, bass, drums, and Robert's screaming delivery of the final verse. <br />\\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" is classic Zep groove.  \\"Four Sticks\\" is great but is the album's low point. <br />\\"Going to California\\" is one of the band's best folk songs while \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" opens with the hammer of the gods, aka John Bonham's drum kit.  I don't know if its appropriate, so if this is offensive I appologize but this song makes me think of Hurricane Katrina.  I encourage all to listen to this song and ponder on that disaster.  For me it made the song all the more powerful and all the more somber. <br />I guess I've rambled enough but thanks for reading.  Nuff said.
B0000027EP|4.0|I wouldn't go as far as to say that Motorhead's entire catalog is like one big 150 song album.  I would say it is more like three or four 40 song albums. Lemmy & co are, shall we say, consistant. <br /> <br />Few bands can get away with so little re-invention, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it. <br /> <br />This album is just more of the same.  If you like Motorhead, this one is good enough to put on in the background while you are busy, and occasionally you will hear a particularily good part and smile.  There is no Ace of Spades, or Killed By Death on this one, but it is par with about 8 other perfectly good Motorhead albums. <br /> <br />The title track is worth the whole purchase, though. To hear Lemmy's rupturing open wound of a larynx attempt to sing a solemn ballad about facing certain grim death in WW1 is surprisingly touching, if only in its candid sincerity and lack of pretense.
B000E1155E|4.0|...but I like this album.  Quite a bit actually. <br /> <br />For all the people who think Arctic Monkeys haven't put together an album filled with catchy little tunes, listen to \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor,\\" \\"Perhaps Vampires is a Bit Strong, But...\\" and \\"Still Take You Home,\\" a few times, and tell me if you're not humming each tune as you attempt to work.  I'm doing it right now. <br /> <br />I'm not much a fan of British noise, the genre which this album falls into, but Arctic Monkeys have produced a sound unique to anything I have heard in quite some time.  I'm not a Sex Pistols fan.  I don't think punk music has shaped modern rock music.  I bought this on the recommendation from a friend and from Amazon, after seeing that people who purchased Arcade Fire's \\"Funeral\\" and Bright Eyes \\"It's Morning...I'm Wide Awake\\" had been buying this album.  There is little resemblence between the three bands whatsoever, so I can't say whether fans of the other two bands will automatically love Arctic Monkeys.  In any case, if you're looking for infectious, catchy rock music, this is an album you should enjoy.
B000AARKOO|2.0|Come on now, if you've already seen the film and love it, it isn't fair to read reviews and vote \\"not helpful,\\" because you weren't going to buy the DVD anyway; you already have it.<br /><br />That said, it was hard to choke down this line from the editorial review:  \\"It's hard to believe Ridley Scott's handsome epic won't become the cinematic touchstone of the Crusades for years to come. \\"<br /><br />Actually, it is easy to believe.  The film is not an accurate depiction of anything associated with the Crusades.  Ridley Scott coughs up the same visually spectacular but morally ambiguous and substance-free film he is notorious for.<br /><br />As for inaccuracies, the weapons, armor and combat styles are inaccurate.  The theology presented is inaccurate for both sides.  The ethnicity is inaccurate.<br /><br />The dialogue is so 21st century it is almost painful to listen to the anachronisms and malapropisms. The political correctness may go down well in Hollywood these days but it is hardly faithful to the times of the film and it is almost surreal to imagine any European man of the eleventh or twelfth century behaving the way they are portrayed herein!<br /><br />But hey, if you just want to see an \\"epic\\" and don't care about veracity, if mediocre acting is all that you require, or if you are keen on Orlando Bloom, go for it!
B00007E8O5|5.0|They say that \\"grunge\\" is gone. Jerry Cantrell is officially categorized as \\"post grunge\\" but calling Degradation Trip \\"post grunge\\" is like comparing Bill Haley and the Comets to Led Zep. It's apples to oranges. <br /> <br />If Degradation Trip Volumes 1&2 had come out in the early nineties it would surely be one of the seminal \\"grunge\\" albums of all. It has all the key elements. Distorted guitar. Slow deliberate tempos. Dark lyrics. <br /> <br />Don't let the double cd scare you off in favor of the original release. This is the most utterly captivating, electrifying, and satisfying 140 minutes of heavy rock music you will ever experience. <br /> <br />Be prepared though, this album is no Polyanna. It's dark, almost scary at times. \\"Feel The Void\\", for example, is eerie and just plain makes my skin crawl. I love it! It's like going to a good scary movie and being delightfully frightened. I love music that makes me feel something. This'll do it believe me. <br /> <br />But, at the same time, the feel of the album is not heaviness just for the sake of heaviness. It's dark, as I said, it's harrowing, it's almost depressing at times, but it is also obviously a brutally honest musicl revelation into the life experiences and inner emotions of Jerry Cantrell. <br /> <br />The first song on the album \\"Psychotic Break\\" starts the strange eerieness of Jerry's Degradation Trip. Oddly enough, these songs were written before the death of Jerry's long time friend and Alice in Chains musical collaborater Layne Staley. And yet, a line in \\"Psychotic Break\\" says \\"Thinking 'bout my dead friends whose voices ring on.\\" I can't help but view this line as almost a eulogy in advance for someone he knew was dying. <br /> <br />\\"Bargain Basement Howard Hughes\\" is ostensibly directed at Layne Staley. \\"Enigma wrapped in a riddle. Your life I belittle . . . Stubborn bast**d, hard head knocking. We had our good years too. Though apart, you're still in my heart. I'd give anything for you.\\" It'sobvious that Jerry's frustration with Layne's situation came flooding out in this song. <br /> <br />Jerry dosn't just vent about Layne on Degradation Trip either. In several songs he points the finger directly at himself. Songs such as \\"Owned\\" and \\"Pro False Idol\\" are brutally honest without, however, sounding like someone whose whinning \\"Nobody loves me, everybody hates me, guess I'll go eat worms.\\" He just sounds honest. <br /> <br />By the way, I was skepticle about Jerry's vocals at first because I always felt that he lacked the vocal edge that Layne Staley demonstrated. I realize now that his lighter vocals with Alice in Chains was needed to offset Layne's heavy, screeching, style. Jerry lowers his voice on Degradation Trip and this gives the songs the edge they need to be truly effective along side the dark theme of the album as a whole. <br /> <br />It's hard to believe that Degradation Trip has not received more interest and radio airplay but like many solo attempts by members of supergroups, it may well be in the shadow of the great Alice in Chains musical catalog. <br /> <br />Hopefully, even years after it's initial release, word of mouth will help this album garner the attention it richly deserves.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I saw this movie at least 13 times while it was in release and now own the DVD which I took out for the first time in months and was still blown away. This is a magnificent work of art and shouldn't be missed.  Jim Caviezel's performance as well as the rest of the cast is superb and Mel Gibson again proves he is a master film-maker. Unforgettable.
0345409671|1.0|**I request not reading on if you don't want me to ruin this or later books in the series** I am a fan of Anne Rice's earlier vampire novels. I thought that this novel and the ones that followed were plainly stipid due to the whole intertwining religion into vampirism. I think these books were just cheap shots in attempt for her to make some cash or an wasted attempt to satisfy fans. I'm a big fan of vampires and this ruined any enjoyment in reading any more of her novels. In my own opinnion she should not have made Lestat go all \\"goody-goody\\" and run to god.
B000024D4R|5.0|It is commonly accepted that this lp is underated.Also it is common knowledge that Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin were the two most influential bands of Rock ever.Big fat words you may say but this is the truth.Anyone who can't accept this,meybe he should start all over his musical journey.The album is gloomy personal and so emotional full of political innuendoes,that is why is so hard to be widely accepted.But remember,only musical prodigies can combine all these elements.Pink Floyd were one of them.Top of the cream.For sceptical and requiring fans..They always chalenge the audiences.They were the lords..everybody knows that..
B00005V0X5|5.0|After being disappointed by the remasters of Peace Sells... and Rust in Peace, I was a little hesitant to try the remaster of KIMB, but after hearing this new version I can safely say that while there are places that it still could've been improved, it blows away the original release.   <br /> <br />GUITARS: <br />Unfortunately, the new mix wasn't able to completely take away the sludgy production on the guitars, but it does help a great deal.  It also balances Mustaine and Poland much better and brings out things that were buried in the original mix, especially in the intro to \\"Looking Down The Cross.\\"   <br /> <br />BASS: <br />The new mix gives Ellefson's bass lines a much-needed boost in the bottom end, which adds significant weight and drive to each song.  However, it de-emphasizes the high end of the bass mix, which sacrifices some of the clarity of his picking; this is most noticeable in \\"Killing Is My Business...\\" and \\"Chosen Ones,\\" where his picking was very prominent in the original mix. <br /> <br />DRUMS: <br />The improvement on the drums is phenomenal.  Samuelson's work was fairly complex but you'd never have known it from the original mix.  The remix brings out his drum lines in almost crystal-clear clarity and makes all the songs sound 100X better, especially \\"Rattlehead.\\"  My only complaint is that the toms, especially the lower ones, seem to have more emphasis than the kick drum(s?) and snare. <br /> <br />VOCALS: <br />The new mix also helps Mustaine's vocals immensely, making them much clearer and easier to understand, a trend which carried over to the other remixes that I've heard.  It brings out more clearly the dual vocals on \\"Killing...\\", and adds in a layered vocal on \\"Loved to Deth\\" that was either absent from the original recording or completely buried in its mix.  There are also a few extra screams that weren't present on the original release.  One thing that the new mix takes away from the original is in the chorus of laughter before thelast verse in \\"Loved to Deth\\" which has a lot of the cheezy-sounding \\"demonic\\" laughter taken out of the mix.   <br /> <br />In regards to the extra material:  I found the \\"edited\\" version of \\"These Boots\\" to be hilarious the first time I listened to it, and the demo songs are a good way to see how Mustaine has improved as a singer.  Incidentally, I read somewhere that these demos are what landed them with Combat Records. <br /> <br />All in all, this is the one Megadeth remix/remaster that I can recommend without any reservations.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|It's an impossible job to take a wonderful \\"stage production\\" like Phantom of the Opera and reproduce that \\"ambiance\\" and \\"feeling\\" that come from a live performance and turn it into a film/DVD project, but this version does a remarkably job at doing just that.  No - a \\"canned\\" film version will never be as good as a live stage performance - but, I think this one comes as close as possible.  I love this play, and I actually like how they made the Phantom out to be a little more human and realistic in this version.  In this version, we see and feel the Phantom's pain and suffering and longing for Christine.  Yes, it makes him a more \\"tame\\" version of the Phantom; but I liked that.  The scene when the Phantom witnesses Christine and the Viscount declaring their love for each other - you can just feel the anguish he's experiencing knowing that his precious Christine cares deeply for someone else.  It's the ultimate heartache of unrequited love, and this emotion comes across vividly on the screen.  This version almost makes you root for the Phantom to win Christine in the end, and I think that is what makes it so special.  It's a heart-wrenching love story, and I was enchanted throughout the whole movie.  If you are a \\"Phantom\\" buff, this is a worthy production.
B00005JO20|3.0|I saw this film four times in the theater and even with it's shortcomings felt very entertained each time.  This DVD release does not feel very satisfying and leaves one hoping for a LOTR-style 4 disc version later in the year.   <br /> <br />The audio mix is not lively at all.  All that's included is a 5.1 Dolby mix.  How about a DTS version?  The extras, even on the 2 disc \\"Special Edition\\" leave much to be desired.  The 1st disc has Volkswagen and NYC commercials.  The second disc, which I did not spring for included the Post Production diaries, which were seen on Kongisking.net and a few other featurettes.  Like I said, with these paltry extras, there had better be a 4 disc film-geek special edition in the fall.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is a film-making masterpiece.  It is hard to watch and some scenes are frighteningly graphic, but that is the whole point of this story.  We sometimes tend to \\"gloss\\" over the Crucifixion, thinking only of the goodness (Easter, God's love and grace).  We tend to forget how very much Christ suffered for us.  Not only was the physical torment horrifying and and heart-wretching, but He took on every sin we ever had or ever will have.  Imagine having the sins of murderers, child-molesters, and every form of human evil there is thrust upon you --- along with being beaten unrecognizable and hung upon a cross.  It is simply more than we, as mere humans, can ever possibly imagine.  Seeing this torment that He endured for us should (and does) make us feel humble, guilty, and overwhelmed with what He did for us.  This is a powerful, moving film - and I have watched it numerous times, and cannot make it through without bursting into tears.  It touches your soul and makes you realize just how precious and unbelievably incredible the power of salvation through God's grace is.  It is a humbling experience, and this film is absolutely magnificent.  You cannot watch it without being moved in some way.
B000002AGE|5.0|Depending on your point of view, this is either a stellar five-star release or a listenable but disappointing two-star release. Please read the entire review before you press that \\"not helpful\\" button.<br /><br />For the typical person, this isn't a bad recording. In fact, it's a great recording. But...<br /><br />I absolutely loved this band when I was a younger man, I had every single record they made, including this one. Heavy Weather was the last Weather Report release that I purchased. It isn't that the playing is bad, it's great! It isn't that the tunes are bad compositions, they're great! But this release was a major departure, the artistic sensibilities of Zawinul and Shorter evaporated with Black Market. Afterward they went from explorers to conquerers. I like explorers, especially musical explorers. The Mysterious Traveler that was Weather Report landed after Black Market. It was a soft landing. I'm thinking it is because Black Market must have been the pinnacle of what this band was originally about - the exploration of sound and rhthym. This release is about the use of formula - taking what you know works and crafting it into something very marketable.<br /><br />So what? Heavy Weather seems to be more about the cash - and that's ok. Having cash is definitely a nice thing. These guys want nice things too. And why shouldn't they have them? They paid their dues. But it's still a little sad to me. It's as though Zawinul and Shorter abandoned the mission, abandoned the spirit of exploration for sure-fire hits. This was/is a popular release and made this band the superstar darlings of jazz - and rightly so. You might like Heavy Weather, but to my ears it was clear this band was headed in a direction that did not, and still does not interest me. I cringe everytime I hear Birdland (especially if it's done by the Manhattan Transfer). Give me Blackthorn Rose, Boogie Woogie Waltz, 125th Street Congress, Orange Lady, The Man in the Green Shirt and Nubian Sundance anyday over this polished, highly produced set of hits (you can dance to all of it)! If you like this release, please don't get mad...<br /><br />How can I say this... To me, listening to Weather Report's earlier recordings is like a date with the love of my life and talking long into the night about the things you often wonder about: Is there life \\"out there?\\" Who invented bread? When the universe stops expanding and starts deflating will history run in reverse out of the past? But listening to Heavy Weather is like a date with a good looking, well-dressed, expensive call girl with whom I have absolutely nothing in common. We know why we are here and we can have a good time for a few moments but there really is nothing there, no mystery.<br /><br />And now for today's weather report - \\"Starting today, everyday will be warm and sunny.\\" ...So why even bother to tune in?<br /><br />Postscript: Joe Zawinul's recent offerings are exponentially better than this release. Zawinul reclaimed his soul from the devil himself. One can hear he has returned to the status of explorer. His heart must not have really been in the world of pop-jazz. Vienna Nights... now THAT's more like it Joe. Awesome!hed, highly produced set of hits (you can dance to all of it)! If you like this release, please don't get mad...     How can I say this...

B0007GAEGC|5.0|The songs on this CD are simply beautiful.  The voices, the music, the melodies are all enthralling and enchanting.  I listen to this over and over, and it never fails to make me smile and find peace and tranquility.  I would highly recommend purchasing this.  It is wonderful.

B00005Y6YB|5.0|I Recently introduced my Wife to Lonesome Dove. At the end of this 6 hour long mini-series when Woodrow F. Call walks across the bridge as the credits begin to roll she turned to me and said, \\"is it all over? I wanted it to keep going!\\" That statement is a great testimony to what a wonderful and moving story Lonesome Dove is.<br /><br />This star studded movie is lead by the brilliant acting of Academy Award winning actors Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones as Captains Augustus McCrae and Woodrow F. Call, two former legendary Texas Rangers who embark on an epic journey from Texas to Montana to build a cattle ranch. Filling out this televised mini-series is other Academy Award winning actors including, Angelica Huston, portraying Clair Allen, Gus MaCrea's long lost love, and Chris Cooper, as Arkansas Sheriff July Johnson. Academy Award nominee Diane Lane portrays the sweet yet tragic Miss Lorena Wood who is trying to over come her current profession and find a more respectable life. Another Academy Award nominated actor, Frederick Forrest plays the evil half-Indian Blue Duck. The rest of the cast is a list of equally impressive actors; Danny Glover, Rick Schroder, Robert Urich, Barry Corbin, Steve Buscemi, Glenne Headly, and D.B. Sweeney.<br /><br />The movie revolves around and is sustained by Duvall and Jones's characters. These two embody these characters and bring them to life as no others could. With a roller coaster ride of human emotion along the way, viewers will be drawn into this spectacular story and the rest of its captivating cast of characters as they live out the drama of this epic journey. The story is creatively woven as the synchronicities of each of the characters lives become entwined with one another. This movie will transport you back to the splendor and the tragedies of life in the American West of the 19th century and it will reveal why this time period holds such a fascinating hold on the minds of people today. This mini-series is a classic and it deserves to be. The quality of this movie is equal to, if not surpassing, any feature film that has been produced by Hollywood studios.be.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Q: How many recording artists can claim to have made their best album more than 20 years into their career? <br />A: Very few, but add Madonna to that very short list. <br />Confessions on a Dance Floor is Madonna's long awaited masterpiece. This CD is a winner from start to finish. No tracks to skip. No clunkers/cringing moments (no whiney-rich-girl-rapping or overwrote ballads) Just a solid, A+ CD that accentuates what she has always done best: great dance-pop! <br />5 stars...easy.
B00005B36H|5.0|I have been a Tool fan ever since I was in the 6th grade when aenema came out.  This is by far my most favorite cd of all times.  It is a very complex cd to figure out and in order to do so you must listen to it over and over until you know what comes next! My favorite song is Lateralis.  This song has the most amazing words along with a beautiful rhythm, and the drums are the most amazing in this song in my opinion (i am a huge drum fan) At about 7 and a half minuets through the song you hear the sliding bass lines that are awesome too.  Other great tracks are The grudge, The patient, Ticks and leeches, Parabol and Parabola.  If you are new to Tool try the Undertow cd first then dive into this one!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|All of these songs just make you want to sing along with the CD.  He has such a great voice.  I totally recomment this CD to anyone.  At first I only had one favorate song but now I have at least four.  I am so glad I made this purchase!

055380457X|3.0|On the surface of it, the story of Google is about as exciting as a tale of the Dewey Decimal System. Google is the 21st century equivalent of a library's card catalog. The excitement -- and inflated stock prices -- for Google is somewhat hard to explain.  It seems to be compounded of admiration for the computer skills of Google's founders, amazement at their youth, and envy of the billons of dollars in assets they now possess.    <br /> <br /> This is a biography of the 30-something Google founders and of the company.  There's little here that amounts to \\"inside\\" information. The portrayal of Brin and Page, the founders, is superficial.  There virtues are touted, but we don't get any insight into their personal lives -- except that they like to go to an annual counter-culture event in Nevada which is distinguished by pot smoking, nudity, and unconventional philosophical discussions.  Likewise, we learn little about how Google and its search engine works. At the end of the book about all we know is that Brin and Page have a penchant for secrecy and control and that Google has outfoxed its competitors with a combination of technical skill and competitive spirit.         <br /> <br />The book gets off to a dismal start with one of the founders spouting platitudes to a high school class in Israel.  It gets a bit better after that as the creation and development of Google is described.  The two best parts of the book are (1) the fried chicken recipe, which, as a favorite of both Elvis and Google, can't be bad; and, (2) several appendices in which cool things to do on Google are described and a wildly unconventional aptitude test used by Google for employment applicants  is reproduced. The aptitude test (I would certainly fail) gave me a taste of how Google thinks.      <br /> <br />Smallchief
B0000033OT|5.0|This album is one that I always end up returning to. Donny Hathaway's vocal and piano talent really shine on this one and that combined with the strong song selection made for an impressive debut album. I don't usually like instrumentals that much, but \\"The Ghetto\\" remains one that I never tire of. The addictive groove of Donny Hathaway's keyboard work and the drums have made this a favorite of mine. \\"Thank You Master (For My Soul)\\" also remains one of the most moving songs I've ever heard. Donny Hathaway's vocals are simply amazing, and he attains just the right touch of gospel delivery in this thank you to God. Donny Hathaway is someone who deserves more credit than he gets for his contributions to music, and any fan of R&B should own this. His live CD is also highly recommended if you enjoy his music. When Donny Hathaway died the world not only lost a talented musician, but also lost a very spiritual and caring brother. Thank God he left us with this music to remember him and his message.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I love both Kill Bill movies and can watch them over and over again.  The two soundtracks provides a great recap of the movie itself.  I had to admire the selection of these songs - so subtle and to the point.
B00000099Y|5.0|I simply cannot say enough positive things about this CD.  I won't go into all the sophistication of it, that's been beaten to death.   <br /> <br />This is easily one of the top 5 CDs I own (of around 1000).  If I didn't like it, I wouldn't have now bought it 6 separate times (due to being stolen, scratched badly, etc.) since it came out.  It's everything a great rock CD should be.  It's one of a few CDs (all of Tool's plus some others) that I can listen to all the way through.  That usually takes awhile though, since I tend to listen to each song 4 or 5 times. <br /> <br />Seriously, if you love great music and musicianship, get this.  Otherwise, go get the new Buckcherry CD.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|More than a great love story, Brokeback Mountain is a powerful relevant film because it shows the costs of homophobia which is still a current problem for some. It shows how Ennis' internalized homophobia affected the lives of the two lovers (Jack and Ennis) and the families surrounding them. And this makes their story all the more tragic.    Director Ang Lee shows this in a very subtle, subdued manner which is one of the best films assets. And the movie grows on you and the effect stays long after you've watched it.     If you get the DVD, watch out for the other scenes you might have missed like the exchange of glances between Jack and Ennis while Randy Quaid picks up the phone during their initial briefing; the interchanging of shirts which I read somewhere is Heath's suggestion; the long distant glances while sheepherding, etc.    My favorite scenes are definitely the last encounter between the two and the flashback \\"sleeping like a horse\\" scene afterwards.  Look at young Jack's expressive eyes as Ennis leaves...
B000E8NRR6|5.0|Chill out on the \\"techno-talk\\" guys, this album is SMOKING HOT! <br />The guitar firm of Herrington, McCracken, & Krantz have brought back the creative diversity of Steely Dan albums like \\"Katy Lied\\" and particularly \\"Royal Scam\\".

B000005H40|5.0|Not counting his output with Miles or Monk, this is Coltranes most indispensible recording of the '50s and the only album Coltrane cut as a leader for the Blue Note label. Unlike his Prestige recordings which comprise the bulk of his work in the 1950s, Blue Train is not a loose and quickly recorded standards jam session, but an individual and more fully realized work. Coltrane composed all the music except for the Jerome Kern/Johnny Mercer standard I'm Old Fashioned, and wow, what a difference! Blue Train is so much better than his Prestige recordings. Coltrane and company are given the opportunity to take flight and they do. The playing is funky, swinging, powerfully emotional, and oftimes stellar. With a supporting cast of a teenaged Lee Morgan on trumpet, Curtis Fuller on trombone, Kenny Drew on piano and the Miles Davis rhythm section of bassist Paul Chambers and the redoubtable Philly Joe Jones, my favorite drummer of the '50s, how could Blue Train be anything short of amazing? If you're a fan of Coltrane or swinging hard bop, buy this thing now.
B000ENWKN8|1.0|First of, John 5 is an amazing guitar player, but he is restrained to power chords on this release just like he was in Manson. But he can wail, just listen to his solo stuff. I can only assume that person didnt know much about his guitar style.<br /><br /> That said, his inclusion doesnt really add up to much on Educated Horses. The whole thing falls dead on its feet in under 40 minutes. I understand change and new direction but this just seems so forced and fake. The riffs are the same ol' back forth notes, with a few pretentious acoustic numbers. The cool horror film samples would have helped this album some, but not much. Get everything he has done before this, but skip the new one cause it is average at best.
B000002ADT|5.0|Miles walked into the studio that day with minimal arrangements, his men picked the order of the soloists and went for it. With Kind of Blue the jazz world was introduced to modal improvisation and one of the best examples of telepathic group mind ever recorded. The strikingly disparate personalities of the players blend together perfectly and every sublime note counts. Coltrane's entrance during So What? is my favorite moment in jazz. Pour a glass of wine, or roll a fatty, dim the lights and listen.
0679422714|1.0|Jung Chang reminds me of someone who ran away from home and started criticizing her own family. I guess everything of her new life to her will be the best and she will discard all her roots including culture, religion and what her parents have taught her to braise her new found home. I guess it is just human nature and I cannot blame her. She may even been guilty of being a Red Guard before during the real sick period in Chinese history. However, now that she has tasted success and easy money from her last best seller which I agree is creditable as it was based on her own life, she will now not hesitate to stoop low to be even more successful and rich by publishing such a personal vendetta, one-sided and biased account and expect everybody to believe in what she wrote. Such controversies will certainly sell in the Western world and make her filthy rich. People seem to like to talk bad and read about others. To be believable, we have to be fair and balanced in what we write. No person is all bad especially someone who is also admired by so many. You now even have to pay quite a bit just to listen to her lecture now. No, I shall not be brainwashed and fooled by such a person.  As \\"London Review of Books\\" clarified that the book contain distorted, misleading or far-fetched use of evidence and many of their discoveries come from sources that cannot be checked, others are openly speculative or are based on circumstantial evidence, and some are untrue. This portrayal thus impedes serious moral judgment. Every bright piece of evidence goes in, no matter where it comes from or how reliable it is.  Some of Chang and Halliday's arguments go beyond the misuse of sources to make claims that are simply unsourced.  Her next book should give all accounts of how she obtained the so called evidence. Such as where did the interviews take place and when and for how long on each case. Proof and authencity  of source.  I am not surprised her books are banned in China as I am sure they regard her as a traitor to her own country.
B000ENWKN8|4.0|I was thinking o this is just gonna be anothe zombie cd. Im dead wrong. Im very impressed. Normally every song sounds the same and very raw, but i loved em anyway but this was you can kinda say he is more mature. Very very good im excited to see him.  <br /> <br />You might have to get used to it cause its not like BAM right in your face zombie its better. John 5 was a good change but alot of it sounds liek Manson.
B000E97HIA|5.0|As the quintessential Prince fan, I have witnessed not only a musical maturity but an obvious personal maturity as demonstrated in his lyrics (\\"Lolita- you're a fine mama mia, but you'll never make a cheater out of me). I am loving this CD. It has an old school electronica funk to it. I can hear the same vibe from some of his earlier work. Because I feel like I know Prince, I feel a certain pride when listening to 3121.  The music feels (notice I said feels, because one just doesn't hear a Prince song, you FEEl it) like a purposeful effort, like he wrote these songs with us in mind.  The songs I like least are `Black Sweat' and `Satisfied'; they are too reminiscent of older songs. 3121 is my favorite because the listener can interpret it in many different ways. Tamar as an additional vocalist is refreshing. Her voice is not overpowering like Rosie Gaines used to form the NPG.  I find it interesting that Prince can sing  \\"gospel\\" songs, `Word' & `Beautiful, Loved and Blessed', and not at all sound preachy nor sacrilegious. 'The Dance' is a captivating song, especially the ending seemingly ad libbed lyrics. <br />One of the best things about the CD is the photos in the liner notes. I feel like Prince is sharing his world with his fans by allowing us a tour into how he lives. The Purple Highness is nearing 50 years old and is aging like a fine wine. I feel honored to drink from his cup. Keep the music pouring. <br />
B00030590I|1.0|The whole story is nonsense. Some actions are ok, and very colorful, but the story did not make any sense at all. There are four heros who took great risks and got two chances to kill the king of Qin in order to save their own country Zhao, but at the last moment they both give up for a ridiculous reason, and would rather to have their own country Zhao destroyed by Qin. That is the whole story.
0739318101|1.0|Unfortunately some audio books are read in monotone-very dull indeed-but in this audio book the reader goes too far in the opposite direction by reading an adult book as if it's story time and she's a preschool teacher.  <br /> <br />My daughters and I loved the main characters in audio books such as Bridget Jones Diary, The Nanny Diaries, and Sammy's Hill because the reader made us sympathize with them. We knew that whatever the characters did they did with sincerity and whatever happened to them could happen to anyone. Emily Gray, the reader of Can You Keep a Secret, made the main character sound witless and very, very phony. All of the other characters sounded one dimensional. <br /> <br />We listen to audio books on our frequent long car trips. Although we had nothing else to listen to at the time, we could only stand  of this book before we had to turn it off. A few weeks later I randomly read a few chapters of Can You Keep a Secret in a bookstore and thought that it was amusing. Perhaps Emily Gray didn't find the book amusing, so she thought that she needed to go \\"over the top\\" to add humor. If so, it didn't work. She took a lighthearted, enjoyable book and turned it into the equivalent of listening to nails on a blackboard. <br />
B00005JNX0|1.0|I watched this movie with my little one and wished we would have never purchased it.  I spent alot of the movie wanting to cover my child's eyes and ears!  I could definitely have done without all of the sexual references, language, references to alcohol and drug use in this movie that was marketed for kids. Some things you have to watch closely for others are not even disguised in the least....crabs, rectal thermometer jokes, drug hallucinations, etc. This movie definitely taught me a lesson that not all things the movie industry markets for young children are appropriate for them. I would advise any parent buying this for your child to proceed with caution.  Maybe borrow it from someone and watch it first to decide if this material is suitable for your kids before purchasing.
B000BVEKO0|1.0|Youve all lost your minds.Please take a break.2 years or so.In this time listen to your first cd.Notice the awesome sound???The bass,the drums.Notice the singer friggin going crazy.Now when you make the next cd make sure the tone is exactly the same as the first.Exactly.Nothing different.It was perfect.Like KFC chicken!!!Also Jon,start wearing the Adidas suit again and maybe youll have a flashback and start singing with true emotion again.Also get rid of the lame Masters of the Universe mic stand!Money has destroyed yet another great band!!!!!

B000E8N690|2.0|Another movie that got me with the hype. At least I was too busy to go to the theatres when it was playing so I didn't waste a trip. <br />I watched this with friends and was twiddling my thumbs with boredom. It was just like any other musician movie where. outside their jobs, the musicians have pretty mundane uninteresting lives. <br />I was worried something was wrong with my attention span but then someone suggested turning it off and everyone agreed immediately!  <br />We all wondered - whats the fuss about? <br />I think the acting was pretty good but it is hard to tell with a script this mediocre!

B0007PAMR4|5.0|Ah, what COULD have been, what SHOULD have been, alas, never WILL be ...<br /><br />Director David Lynch's quest to adapt Frank Herbert's seminal science fiction epic for the big screen is, in retrospect, one of the more tragic minor chapters in cinematic history. Everyone who knows this story is aware that, in the best of all possible worlds, Lynch might have truly succeeded, in the same way Peter Jackson succeeded with \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Given true artistic control over the project, Lynch might have given us a truly brilliant, if lengthy, film. Lord knows he shot enough footage! Instead, what we are left with are both the tantalizing, albeit abridged, theatrical release, and the horrifically inept \\"extended version\\" that was cobbled together so shoddily that Lynch had no choice but to completely disassociate himself from it. Both versions are included, along with a rich selection of extras, on this DVD package. So if you're going to get David Lynch's film, you might as well spring for this.<br /><br />Lynch has made it abundantly clear that his involvement with this project is not one of the most well-remembered episodes of his filmmaking career. According to the Dreamers of Dune website, \\"The film ... ended up at being more than three hours in length. Unwisely the decision was made to cut it down to just over 2. However this cut hurt the film's exposition, and thus made it nearly incomprehensible to anyone who hadn't read the book.\\" Personally I loved the film when it was released in theaters. A truly faithful adaptation would have to have been at least a couple of hours longer, yet if anything I felt that David Lynch had succeeded in giving us a rich taste of the Dune mythos, dropping us into an almost incomprehensible universe ten thousand years in the future.<br /><br />Years later, when the Sci-Fi Chanel scheduled a broadcast of the film for the first time, there was a great deal of anticipation over news that it would include a lot of extra footage not seen in the theatrical release, and I was psyched. As the broadcast began, my enthusiasm quickly turned to confusion. Directed by Alan Smithee? Who the hell was THAT? But it got worse. Gone was the ethereal introduction by Princess Irulan (Virginia Madsen), replaced instead with lousy illustrations and a potted history of the Galactic Empire as read by some cheesy male narrator. Gone were some key moments of Lynchian weirdness, such as Baron Harkonnen's dispatch of the meek slave boy (the famous \\"heart plug\\" scene) and the baron's spitting in Lady Jessica's face. Hmmm, I guess THAT wouldn't do for TV, now would it?<br /><br />Other aspects of this \\"extended version\\" are simply wrong. The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is shown being escorted to Caladan by ... what, the same Harkonnen henchmen who later take Paul and Jessica out into the desert? Spacecraft are supposed to be landing on Caladan or Kaitain, yet we are shown spacecraft approaching Arrakeen? And that music! What did they do to the music? It's all punched up and melodramatic, not used sparingly and effectively as in the theatrical version. Sure, there's some extra footage here that is fascinating enough in its own right, but overall this \\"extended version\\" has been pieced together so badly that it's no wonder David Lynch disavowed it.<br /><br />Well, this is all water under the bridge now. What's done is done. David Lynch has gone on with his career and learned his lessons about artistic control, giving us sublime films like \\"Blue Velvet,\\" \\"Wild at Heart,\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive.\\" He can't be expected to return to the editing room to give us the version of \\"Dune\\" he should have given us to begin with. Meanwhile, the Sci-Fi Channel eventually went on to fund a couple of admittedly auspicious \\"Dune\\" miniseries while relegating the \\"Alan Smithee\\" version to an occasional broadcast once in a blue moon. Older DVDs of Lynch's original theatrical release gather dust on the shelves of stores, and those of uswho still admire that version are left to lament what might have been. Oh well.hose of us who still admire that version are left to lament what might have been. Oh well.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|I picked up this album today, and yes, at first it does not sound like the typical Rob Zombie album.  But I applaud him for wanting to change and do something new with his music.  This album is not that heavy, and has alot of acoustic arrangments and shows a more mature, melodic side.  Yes, we could've had another album like his last two, Hellbilly Deluxe from 1998, and The Sinister Urge from 2001, but what we got is a nice welcomed change that shows more artistic growth.  On the first listen, you may not think its a great album, but take a few listens, and it will grow on you. <br /> <br /> <br />I won't give a track by track review of the album, but stand out tracks noteworthy of saying are \\"American Witch\\", with its hard guitar driven chorus, and there is a nice short guitar solo in there.  Of course \\"Foxy Foxy,\\" the first single off the album which mostly everyone has heard by now. Some people might think it has a pop-rock sound to it, which it kinda seems I agree. Nonetheless, a great choice for the first single.  And other two hard rockers are \\"Let It All Bleed Out,\\" and \\"Ride,\\" which are sure to be moshers at any Zombie concert.  <br /> <br />All in all, I defintley recommend this album to all longtime fans of Rob Zombie and also just any lover of rock and metal music.  You won't be disappointed! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />TRACKLISTING OF THE ALBUM: <br /> <br />1. SAWDUST IN THE BLOOD <br /> <br />2. AMERICAN WITCH <br /> <br />3. FOXY, FOXY <br /> <br />4. 17 YEAR LOCUST <br /> <br />5. THE SCORPION SLEEPS <br /> <br />6. 100 WAYS <br /> <br />7. LET IT ALL BLEED OUT <br /> <br />8. DEATH OF IT ALL <br /> <br />9. RIDE <br /> <br />10. THE DEVIL'S REJECTS <br /> <br />11. THE LORDS OF SALEM
0743454537|5.0|The ending of this book took me totally off-guard.  Many parts of it are unrealistic.  Jesse's crimes were way too serious for any father with a conscience to sweep under the carpet as Brian did.  I also doubt a person with epilepsy as serious as Campbell's would have a driver's license.  I disagree with the reader who thought that every character's voice sounded the same.  I could feel the difference in each character when he/she told his/her side of the story.  I love this book because it opened my eyes to the complexity of the subject matter of the designer embryo.  The most powerful moment is when Anna testifies.  Picoult did a masterful job of managing the timeline and switch between past and present.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|The Chariot Stripped CD is amazing - I just put in on my iPod this last week and it's been playing pretty regularly. I've had the regular Chariot on there for a while, and though I love that CD, this Stripped is so beautiful and melodic - reaches right in and grabs you. <br /> <br />Must have!
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Everything else has already been said so i'm just gonna say that Peter Jackson is truly one of the greatest Director's of all time & this film is a Masterpiece! He captures the moral message in how the human race will take mother natures beauty & selfishly detroy it. To me Kong is a metaphor for the planet earth! Anyway Peter Jackson takes us on a visual & emotional thrillride before punching us all in the gutt with an ending that we all new was comeing but we just didn't want it to come. Kinda like watching a repeat of the 86 world series & already knowing the outcome but just hopeing the ball this time around won't go between Bill Buckner's legs. But it always does!

0684833395|4.0|The ad in The New York Times for Joseph Heller's Catch-22 overpowered the eye, while the text overpowered the mind of its readers.  The book revolves around one catch, Catch-22, which states, \\"a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he formally requests to be relieved proves that he is sane and cannot be relieved\\" (45).  The catch changes meanings several times throughout the novel; but always clearly conveys the satirical tone of Heller's work.  <br /> <br />Heller, a bombardier during World War II himself, begins his novel with the main character, Yossarian, in the hospital.  He had vowed not to fly any more combat missions.  Readers are introduced to a variety of other characters: Orr, Yossarian's roommate; Clevinger, Dunbar, Havermeyer, other bombardiers; Doc Daneeka; Hungary Joe; Major Major, and many more.  Each chapter focuses on a different character.  The novel follows Yossarian on his combat missions, leaves in Rome, and stays in the hospital.  Throughout, readers are told of Yossarian's fear. <br /> <br />Heller's Catch-22 is worth the time to read.  Heller clearly conveys the feeling bombardiers have during their combat missions.   <br />   <br />   \\"There was no established procedure for evasive action.  All you needed was fear, and Yossarian had plenty of that, more fear than Orr or Hungry Joe, more fear even than Dunbar, who had resigned himself submissively to the idea that he must die someday. Yossarian had not resigned himself to that idea, and he bolted for his life wildly on each mission the instant his bombs were away\\" (50). <br /> <br />Seeing the machinery that could kill you at any second would take many hours of mental conditioning just being able to remain calm.  No one would be able to get used to the flak.  In a way the catch states that as long as soldier possesses fear, he is sane. <br /> <br />Heller uses a disrupted stream of consciousness to help create his tone.  The novel covershuge leaps of time.  At one moment, the novel will be before a mission called Avignon, but suddenly will be right after Ferrara, a mission that happened long before Avignon.  What one comes to realize is that the chronological order does not matter.  The novel is more about the fear felt by the men and the different ways each man copes with fear.  More importantly are the repeated images and concepts. <br /> <br />Yossarian's fear never ends, which is why some of the imagines and concepts are repeated.  One such image is the soldier in white.  When Yossarian was in the hospital, a soldier was brought in during the night that had a complete body cast on.  He later died of his injuries.  As Yossarian's fear is always with him, so is the memory of the soldier in white.  Yossarian could easily picture himself as having \\"two useless legs and two useless arms\\" (10).  Yossarian did not appreciate the reminder of what could happen to him on any of his missions.  Another repeated concept is the namesake of the novel, Catch-22.  Catch-22 changes meanings throughout the novel.  For Yossarian and the men, the meaning has already been stated.  For the citizens of Rome, a city occupied by American troops, \\" `Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing' \\" (407).  Troops could evict people from their homes or force a restaurant to close and the Italians had to follow the orders, only because they could not stop the troops.  What the men are afraid of changes for each man, but they are all afraid.  Hungary Joe is afraid of going stateside, Nately of losing his beloved whore, and Yossarian of losing his life.  Many repetitions appear in Heller's Catch-22, these are just two examples.   <br /> <br />Heller also portrays the fear felt by the men by telling the novel in a third-person point of view.  When a reader only experiences one character's viewpoint, the reader can have difficulty judging what may be exaggerated or underestimated.  With the third-person, readers enjoy objectivity.  For instance, one could come to the conclusion that all of the soldiers are afraid.  For example, Havermeyer is a bombardier that will fly in straight, drop his bombs, and fly out with little or no evasive maneuvering.  However at La Spezia, an Italian port where the men encountered very heavy antiaircraft fire, \\"even Havermeyer resorted to the wildest evasive action he could command when he saw what a vast distance he had still to travel to escape\\" (375).  Readers realize that the fear that Yossarian feels is universal.  However, Yossarian is the prime example of what fear can drive a person to do. <br /> <br />Yossarian is driven to many unusual actions because of his fear of dying.  He pretended that he had a liver condition so as to stay in the hospital.   <br />   <br />   \\"Yossarian ran right into the hospital, determined to remain there forever rather than fly one mission more than the thirty-two missions he had.  Ten days after he changed his mind and came out, the colonel raised the missions to forty-five and Yossarian ran right back in, determined to remain in the hospital forever rather than fly one mission more than the six missions more he had just flown\\" (165).   <br /> <br />He also walked \\"backward with his gun on his hip and refused to fly any more missions\\" (392).  Yossarian was willing to start injuring people from his company, just to keep from flying.   <br /> <br />Heller's novel, Catch-22, deserves its place as one of America's classic novels.  The book explores the mentalities of the men putting their lives on the line for America.  Heller's past influenced his writing of the book, and his use of several literary devices form his message.  The catch is that people will take advantage of a person, just because that person cannot stop them.  He was able to mold his novel into a classic by asking one question: what's the catch? <br />   <br />
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Unfortunately, so much is lost in translations. I personally speak all 3 languages(English, Russian and Ukranian) AND was born and raised in Odessa. <br />The movie is definitely a gem, but for a very specific audience :)
B000E1155E|5.0|It just blows my mind how people rate this CD so low. These guys are SO YOUNG and they best most rock bands out today. (Notice I said TODAY, not YESTERDAY with bands like Beatles and Zeppelin)<br /><br />Its style is unique, and I think thats why a lot of people don't like it. The opening track \\"The View from the Afternoon\\" is a great song, with a great beat, and great drums.<br /><br />Second comes \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" which, in fact, I find myself comparing to Green Day's \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" because when you first hear it, you're like \\"Oh my God, this is the best song ever.\\" Then, as you continue to listen to it, it grows old. Still good though.<br /><br />Third is \\"Fake Tales from San Francisco\\" which is also a great song, though not my favorite on the CD. It gets repetitive, but that's sort of the theme of the song. It also follows a really cool style that I don't think I've ever before in rock music.<br /><br />Fourth is \\"Dancing Shoes\\" which is a song with an amazing bass part. Anyone who plays or is learning to play bass guitar should give this song a listen. As the song progresses, it gets even more catchy and soon you will find yourself blaring it.<br /><br />After that, the CD sort of goes downhill.<br /><br />Fifth is one of the longest song titles I've ever heard of; the title is so long Windows Media Player won't even display it fully. The title is \\"You Probably Couldn't See the Lights for Yourself But You Were Staring Straight At Me.\\" As for the song, its ok, but theres nothing special about it. I usually skip it.<br /><br />Sixth is \\"Still Take you Home\\" which is a song that relates to the fifth track, but it has a more bouncy beat but to tell you the truth I don't really don't like the song.<br /><br />Now the CD picks up again.<br /><br />Seventh is \\"Riot Van\\" which is a slower song with a good guitar part. The song reminds me of Led Zeppelin's \\"Gallow's Pole.\\" But then again, that's just me. Overall a good song.<br /><br />Eighth is \\"Red Light Indicates Doors are Secure.\\" I happen to love this song. Has a really bouncy beat but there's one problem, and that is that the song is simply too short! I want more. REALLY good song.<br /><br />Ninth is the best song on the CD, and one of my all-time favorite songs at that. \\"Mardy Bum\\" has an amazing guitar part, and it is one of the few love songs on the CD. I'm actually listening to it as I type this. I'm not sure if I can compare it to any other songs I know. If you don't want to buy the CD, get the song on iTunes or MSN Music or whatever service you use. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Tenth is one of the worst songs on the CD, maybe the worst. \\"Perhaps Vampires is a Bit Strong But...\\" It doesn't really sound like a real song. It's not the worst song I've ever heard, but I usually skip this one too.<br /><br />Eleventh competes with Track 9 for the best song on the CD. \\"From the Ritz to the Rubble\\" is the probably one of the most unique songs I've ever heard. What happens when you mix rap with rock? You get this song. I happen to hate rap, but I find myself listening to this song over and over again. The verse is REALLY cool.<br /><br />The twelfth and final song, \\"A Certain Romance\\" was the second song performed by them on SNL a couple weeks ago. Its slow like Riot Van, but has a better guitar part and is overall a better song.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this CD. Don't listen to the other users. Get this CD and add it to your collection, load it on your MP3 player, and you will find yourself listening to it over and over again, like I did. Enjoy yourself!good song. <br /> <br />Eighth is \\"Red Light Indicates Doors are Secure.\\" I happen to love this song.

0375751513|5.0|Oscar Wilde is a witty and brilliant writer, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a treasure.  One of it's best aspects is something another reviewer mislabeled as a flaw, that every viewpoint presented by Wilde is contradicted in another part of the book.  This is absolutely brilliant.  By building an entire book out of contradictions, the reader can take absolutely any message they want from the book, or no message at all.  It meet Wilde's goal (if indeed anything Wilde said can be taken seriously - remember that the paradoxical Henry Wotton is basically a fictional version of Wilde) of \\"art for art's sake,\\" but it can just as easily be a morality tale for anyone that wants one.  Henry Wotton can either be the worst kind of villain or a quite harmless and likeable chap who a dumb kid took too seriously.<br /><br />So read this book for it's witty and memorable dialogue, mostly from Henry Wotton.  Read it for the shocking (at least at the time) tale of Dorian Gray.  Read it for the myriad meanings you can take from it.  Just don't skip it because it doesn't have one, consistent message.  Anyone can write a message.  It takes a genius to write a collection of messages that perfectly balance and disprove one another.

This is probably his second best book but I think they all pretty well suck. Very formulaic and not well done.<br /><br />I'd heard so much good about this book that I wasted money on a hardback, I gave the book away when I was done laughing at it.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This show is terrific.  The acting is spot on, the plots developements intriguing and the arcs terrifically paced.  Weekly subplots that usually have a small tie in to the main season mystery make this show completely must see.  Kristen Bell IS Veronica Mars.  She makes you smile, laugh and cry.  I love this show.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is the only review I've ever written.  I've seen this movie probably several hundred times, approaching 1000.  An equal portion of romance, comedy, and science-fiction.  It's almost a scientific impact analysis exploring every possible result or every conceivable dimension, but done in an incredibly witty way, of ones actions.  It's guaranteed that you will enjoy this movie if you are even remotely fond of any one of the above-mentioned genres.

B000067DCZ|5.0|Usually I am not the type who likes dark, indeterminate, artsy movies -- I prefer to be entertained by a good story, quality comedy or satire. Had I read these reviews, I probably would have not chosen to view this film. However, not knowing what to expect, I found this one very engaging, gripping and more than a bit haunting. Increasingly repulsive, yet fascinating on a number of levels. There is less plot than in the visually-stunning \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" or beautiful muscial \\"Sweeney Todd,\\" (both highly recommended), but this similarly takes you deeper into the twisted psyche of a monstrous human being -- in this case, a repressed middle-aged, French classical piano teacher. Powerful images stayed with me long after viewing. It's a well-crafted, superbly-acted film on a very difficult, abstract subject. Highly recommended if you like looking into the darker layers of humanity, society and sexuality, without Hollywood's mandatory PC crap or in-your-face politicizing. The French may be pains-in-the butt in terms of international relations, but boy can they paint a twisted celluloid portrait. Excellent, but not a first-date movie!
B000BEZPQE|1.0|This band is a joke and a disgrace to the world of not just metal, but music in general. First of everyone needs to realize that this Slipknot is about as much of a metal band as they are a country band (that means they're not much of a metal band). I mean turntables? What the h*ll is that? Metal does not include turntables. But it should, right? because we all know how cool scratching vinyl sounds. In addition to that, if any of you maggots listened to some real metal like Slayer or Death you probably would retreat from the area and bury your head in some sand. Music is suppose to be one of the highest forms of artistic human expression, but what kind of message does music send when it is waterdowned, bland, colorless filth? Let us micro-analyze. Corey is a weak vocalist in my opinion but his performance on this CD is pathetically weak. Ok, dude, take that stupid mask off. You'll be able to breath better. But at the same rate everyone could hear you better, so keep the mask on. Now the guitars...nothing stands out in this department except for how bad it is. Granted, they may not be performing up to their full skill level so I will give them the benifet of the doubt and pass judgement for now. Next, the bass. If music where a house, the drums would be the foundation and the bass would be the wall studs onto which the guitar walls are afixed. Most people don't realize that bass is a one of the most important fixtures of a heavy band because the low pulsing notes help give it the characteristic \\"heavyness\\". Paul Gray just doesn't cut on this album. Oh, alot of low Bs played in time with the kick drum. Whatever, but I have heard that he isn't playing up to his full potential because he was in a technical death metal band and did all kinds of techniques like tapping and such. Now for the most overrated drummer in the history of music. No way is this guy great. Yeah he can play some fast double kick drum but so can hundreds of death and black metal drummer (and probably do it much better and through in some really great fills too). This band is just garbage, as is this CD. No matter how bad they are in the studio, Slipknot really drops the ball live, terrible, absolutely terrible. I'm not going to say that people that like this have bad taste, maybe you're just a little confused. I don't recommend this at all, not even for attempting to force zealous cult leaders and their followers from their hold ups or for torturing Gitmo detainees. Save you're money and spend it on something more useful, like a tie-rack.<br /><br />P.S. This goes to Spike. For starters, Slipknot is not metal (please see above) and their mask certainly kick a** if you are a prebubescent dolt. To me, when a bad has a gimmick like mask or makeup it means that the band is insecure with their music so they are basicly saying, \\"Please look at our mask so you don't realize how weak our music is\\", but I degress. Why is he \\"weird\\" for hating Slipknot? And lastly, Slayer kicks major a**!<br /><br />PSS. To the guy above me: You have completely missed the point I was trying to make about Slipknot's mask. I didn't mean that they were there to gather people's attention, but rather because their music is not that great. The mask act as a gimmick or even as distraction so people don't realize how bad their music is, atleast in my humble opinion. And the comparison to Kiss just confused me. Yes Kiss was/is a hugely popular band, but sense when does popularity equate to what is good? The Back Streets Boys were huge, but I don't think either of us would consider them to be talented or good musicians.<br /><br />I never said that the drummer sucked, I just thought he was vastly overrated. The only reason people think of him as a drum God is because they have never heard anyone better to compare him to. Listen to Cryptopsy or a boatload of other death/black metal bands or even jazz drummers then come back and say that Joey is one of the greatest ever.do it much better and through in some really great fills too).

B00003CXZ4|2.0|I really thought I would like this movie. Everyone I spoke with, said it was like the movie \\"The Machinist\\". It was not! Only the notes and the guy being lost was something like it. Also, I really can't stand Guy Pearce. He is pretentious and arrogant. I could not stand to watch any more of this film. It should have been filmed mostly at night. With some good haunting music for the film score. Just way too bad I paid $18.50 for this mind puzzling crap. Tortuous and it really hurt my brain to try to follow this film. This best part about this film was that it was low budget. I did like that. [...]
B000002L9W|5.0|When David Lee Roth parted ways with Van Halen, there was a ton of bad blood between him and the brothers Van Halen.  We all saw it on MTV in daily diatribes and tauntings and all the hooflaw.  Feelings were hurt, egos bruised, and the press was having a field day stoking the fires.  So Diamond Dave, being exceptionally pissed off, goes out and finds his replacements for the brothers Van Halen.  Welll... many would say that it is almost impossible to find a guitarist to fill Eddie Van Halen's shoes.  Steve Vai fits the bill and then some.  Technically better than the Edward the Great, Vai can play anything.  Will he ever eclipse EVH's legacy as the absolute God of Rock Guitar?  Never.  Sorry Steve, but never, ever, not in a million years.  Being technically superior counts for very little in the eyes of the masses.  Still, if there was ever a burner to give EVH the finger it was Stevie Vai.  And Billy Sheehan?  Could Michael Anthony aspire to lick Sheehan's boots?  Hell no, Billy is God on bass.  So that left Alex Van Halen, a typical but popular drummer in the heavy rock genre.  How about a schlep from The Maynard Feguson Big Band by the name of Gregg Bissonette?  He makes Alex look like a fool.  The band is complete.  All the hired guns are in place.  Diamond Dave can turn his back on the brothers Van Halen and shake his spandexed ass.  Eat 'Em And Smile is born.... along with the Picasso Bros.<br /><br />Right out of the gate we have \\"Yankee Rose,\\" a straight-ahead rocker with David Lee Roth and Steve Vai (via his axe) having a conversation about The Statue of Liberty.  The video was an MTV staple forver and it intoduced us to The Picasso Bros. (DLR & Pete Angeles).  If there was ever a way to tell your former bandmates to \\"F*ck Off!\\"  David Lee Roth found it in a big way.  \\"Shyboy\\" is a song with strange beginings.  Although DLR's name appears on the credits as one of the co-authors, \\"Shyboy\\" is a song straight out of Talas' set list.  Talas?  That would be Billy Sheehan's former Buffalo, NY band that had quite an east coast following and a few records released on independant labels.  A great tune even before it became DLR's, \\"Shyboy\\" shows off the prowess of both Vai and Sheehan.  \\"I'm Easy\\" is a cover tune of the same ilk as \\"Just A Gigolo\\" & Dave's earlier solo effort the Crazy From The Heat EP.  He takes oldtime rock and roll and makes it accessable to a whole new generation of listeners.  Awesome!  \\"Ladies Nite In Buffalo\\"  another little nod in Sheehan's direction, DLR and the boyz take it down a notch and deliver a solid slow rocker.  \\"Goin' Crazy!\\" another MTV staple as the DLR vs. VH war continued all through the summer of 1986.  Straight ahead party boy DLR kinda fun song.  Classic.  \\"Tobacco Road\\" another cover tune.  This one starts with the killer Steve Vai lick and moves into a rollicking good time.  DLR knows how to pick cover tunes.  He's a genius.  This works on every level. \\"Elephant Gun\\" another straight-forward rocker that shows off Vai and Sheehan to the world.  Catchy.  Every hook in the book.  This is why he got the nickname Diamond Dave.  \\"Big Trouble\\" another slow rocker and one of my personal favorites.  Great live.  \\"Bump And Grind\\"  Silly and sexy.  Dave sure knew how to slap a tune together that chicks could strip to.  \\"That's Life\\"  Sinatra.  Who else had more of an ego than DLR.  An oldie but a goodie.<br /><br />All in all, David Lee Roth walked away from Van Halen and when the angry words started flying, he came back singing.  A million times more honest than the pop-tripe the brothers VH started to slop out with their new singer Sammy Hagar.  The best band money could buy.  Would it last forever?  No way in hell, but it was worth the price of admission.  I remember seeing the Eat 'Em And Smile tour when it came to San Diego back in '86.  DLR & Co. were at the top of their game and who were Van Halen anyway?<br /><br />Dig it!Billy Sheehan's former Buffalo, NY band that had quite an east coast following and a few records released on independant labels.

B000002UTY|5.0|I just got me a couple of Quicksilver Messenger Service albums, their self-entitled 1968 debut and Happy Trails. I was not alive in the 1960s, so obviously I couldn't be there to see them live performing at the Fillmore West (often with the Dead or Airplane). Quicksilver was certainly quick to release a live album, it took the Dead three albums before they released a live album, but in the case of Quicksilver, it was only their second album. It's plain to see on their debut, there were some more commercially-inclined pop-oriented stuff in hopes the band would receive chart success, but it also had some nice extended jams and less pop-oriented stuff too, so obviously you would want that album too. With Happy Trails they totally dispensed with any pop-leanings or a radio hit, which works to their benefit. I was a tad skeptical that they covered two Bo Diddley songs, \\"Who Do You Love\\" and \\"Mona\\", but they certainly did it in a very creative fashion. In fact the former was a several movement jam with extended guitar jams from John Cippolina, and some experiments in feedback. \\"Mona\\", the other Bo Diddley song featured some nice use of reverb. \\"Calvary\\" is a totally mindblowing number. It's has that wonderful psychedelic feel, with some Spanish/flamenco influences, then at the end they actually go in the realms of space rock, the kind many early '70s German prog/space rock groups did so well (like Ash Ra Tempel, early Tangerine Dream, Amon Duul II, etc.), with strange sound effects that drone on and on, almost like a precursor to Tangerine Dream's Zeit. Then the band had to close it with a cover of Roy Roger's \\"Happy Trails\\", luckily it's so short it hardly hurts the album. Although the cover has an Old West feel, and one might get the feeling Quicksilver decided to go country, luckily that is not the case at all.    One thing worth noting is the album cover is by George Hunter (a member of the Charlatans, and worked for the Globe Propaganda artwork team), who also did the cover to It's a Beautiful Day's 1969 debut. If you look carefully, you'll see the lady from It's a Beautiful Day once again, wearing the same dress and bonnet, this time waving goodbye to (presumably) her husband riding on horseback.    Truly a great album, and if you're a fan of West Coast psychedelia, this is certainly one to get.
B000E1ZBH2|2.0|I must admit I was excited to hear about another Pride & Prejudice, however, I was sadly disappointed.  I know that it's impossible to do a thorough job like the A&E version in just 2 hours, but it was horribly watered down.  Elizabeth was frumpy looking and dressed poorer than she should have been and Mr. Darcy . . . well McFayden isn't a bad actor but it was annoying to see him pouting through the whole movie looking close to tears in some parts.  He just didn't have the essence that was needed.  Liberties were taken and the movie (although not a bad one in itself) falls miserably short.  If you want to see an interesting version of Pride & Prejudice that is funny and it's amusement adds to the fact it follows the book loosely, check out Bride & Prejudice. <br />Poor Georgiana and Whickam died the death of a thousand deaths.  Their parts were dramatically cut and could have added more depth to the story line.  My friends and I were disappointed that by the end of the movie you had no idea why Elizabeth married Darcy.   You didn't see a real evolution of feelings.  Plus that ending was annoying and entirely too cheesy.
B000008LOU|5.0|Much forgotten album by an underrated band.  Great folk rock songs, good variation of sound, puts you in a good mood.  Necessary if you like Tom Petty or Dylan.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is one of the most underrated albums in history.I cant stop stressing about the greatness of this cd which i rate after the wall,the dark side of the moon and wish you were here.YOU GOT TO HAVE THIS.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000002I6V|5.0|I have never grown tired of this album. \\"Wounded Bird\\" is a classic   Nash song in the truest sense.... Great guitar melody flowing behind a  poetic lyric only Graham Nash could write. \\"Simple Man\\" & \\"I used to be a King\\" are also fantastic songs to listen to over & over again. \\"Be Yourself\\" & \\"There's only one\\" draws you into singing along.....just can't help it. \\"Military Madness & \\"Chicago\\" feed on Nash's political leanings & quality songs as well. If you are CSNY fan, you won't be disappointed with this contribution.
B00009V7T2|4.0|I recently heard \\"Eriatarka\\" on a surf video and was blown away. As a rush of adrenalin surged through my body, I thought, \\"WHO THE HELL IS THAT?!!\\". It vaguely sounded like the band \\"At the Drive-In\\" (2 original members), but much better and more refined. <br /> <br />anyway, after a complete listening, I still think \\"Eriatarka\\" is the best track on the CD (hell, one of the best tracks I've heard...ever). Producer Rick Rubin seems to have had much to do with the magic, considering Ruben-less TMV albums before and after this aren't as good or consistent. <br /> <br />As far as a mainstream audience is concerned, I want to give TMV a high rating for originality, but the lyrics are so random that most won't be able to sing along.  Likewise, the music arrangements aren't boring, but the guitar solos are way too dissonant or \\"outside\\" to be memorable.  TMV is too spacey for it's own good and most of De-loused ends up being only good for background music. <br /> <br />3 and a 1/2 stars (rounded up). <br /> <br />I'm digging Sparta's \\"Porcelain\\" a lot more (the other members of \\"At the Drive-In\\").   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000EGDC14|5.0|Heralded as one of the best albums of 2005 and counting Madonna as a fan, Goldfrapp's third album is a radical departure from their debut and a natural extension of Black Cherry. While not as darkly ecletic as Felt Mountain, Supernature is still nonetheless a gem in its own right.<br /><br />Fusing great dance and electronic elements together along with Will Gregory's trademark production, this is one hell of a dance record. There's the funky retro Ooh La La, the irresistable electro anthemn #1, and the poppy Ride A White Horse, all of which have been cleverly released as singles. Other great tracks include Slide In, Satin Chic and Lovely 2 CU. In fact, it's the album you pop into the CD player and you won't stop grooving until the end.<br /><br />On the US edition, the track Beautiful is tagged along as a bonus. Beautiful sounds like it could have been on Black Cherry, a little chilling and atmospheric than most other tracks on Supernature.<br /><br />The DVD companion on the Deluxe edition is something of a treat. Audiophiles get the 5.1 treatment of the album along with photos, videos and live footages. Not be missed is the teasing video of #1 featuring Alison Goldfrapp with her dog doc in the ops theater.<br /><br />Not that America is going to warm up to any good dance records, but Goldfrapp's Supernature is a treat for anyone with a keen ear for good music.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|I'm a total proponent of enabling the listener to personally tailor lyrics, but Bixler's \\"poetry\\" makes absolutely no sense to me (he can really belt it out though). <br /> <br />For someone who claims no knowledge of music theory, I'm somewhat impressed with Omar's compositions as a whole. If the claim is true, he's obviously gleaned a lot over the past decade playing with all those bands/projects (there is hope for the rest of us). <br /> <br />However, while there are some interesting musical moments, there's are also way too much blatant effects garbage. Tweaking the analog echo effect knobs takes no skill...and it sounds like it (2 minute spans of this are not \\"contrast\\" but overkill to say the least). This filler and other awkward moments probably would have been \\"discouraged\\" if Rick Rubin would have stayed on as producer, possibly making FTM as good as De-loused (both of which end up a background music genre for me). <br /> <br />I'm much more of a Sparta kind of guy.  More rock, less BS. <br />
B000002540|4.0|Of all the live albums this band has ever done, this has got to be a personal best.  Albert Bouchard, the band's drummer, stated in an interview that this was his favorite.  This may not be BOC's best recorded album of all time, but it excells in surprises and unpredictability.  It was listening to OYFOOYN that I was first introduced to this amazing band...they had an aura and a mystyic about them.  Looking at the earlier albums later, I thought...just who are these guys, and better yet...which one was which?   <br />THE SONGS <br /> <br />SUBHUMAN  This band started off with a song that deserved a live recording.  It has a certain Santana quality to it.  Good starting song. <br /> <br />HARVESTER OF EYES  Where did that oooweeoo sound come from?  Synthesizer?  Guitar?  And by the way, who will take responsibility for that? Eric? Buck? Allen? It's perfect!  This is the song that really introduces the album.  It's way better than the SECRET TREATIES version and is unrelenting from beginning to end. <br /> <br />HOT RAILS TO HELL  Joe Bouchard's hellhole trash metal.  Once again, a much different and better turn than in the studio. <br /> <br />RED & THE BLACK  A great song that is an all-time BOC classic, worth it all even just to hear Joe's bass solo. <br /> <br />SEVEN SCREAMING DIZ-BUSTERS  The song your Baptist parents warned you about.  Probably about as controversial a tune as ME-262, this entry has got some assorted treats in it. <br /> <br />BUCK'S BOOGIE  Penned instrumental by Buck and Albert, this jawbreaker has some of the best guitar and keyboard give-and-take ever heard. <br /> <br />THEN CAME THE LAST DAYS OF MAY  Blue Oyster Cult's mellower side.  Yes, this version is much better than their first album's account.  Buck's lead guitar literally sings on this one. <br /> <br />CITIES ON FLAME  BOC comes roaring back with a song I'm sure all devoted BOC fans appreciate.  Albert does the vocals, and this has got to be their best version...oh, to see all ofthis on DVD.  Allen Lanier is especially impressive-to start off with keyboards (on the whole through their career Allen does not sing), and end the song with second guitar. <br /> <br />ME-262  As The Band's The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down is an account of the Civil War from a Southern man' perspective, this song is an account of WW2 from a German bomber pilot's angle of vision...about as controversial a song as Walker Blues by Steve Earle. This take on the song is a little inferior to the one on SECRET TREATIES but worth it to hear all of them on guitar.  This is the live part to watch the early charter members do their five-man guitar frontal assault before the audience. <br /> <br />BEFORE THE KISS, A REDCAP  My top-ten personal favorite from BOC.  Actually, I love both takes on this one. <br /> <br />MASERATI GT  A song by MC5 that I'm sure BOC loved to cover.  This song has a certain roadhouse quality to it and it is enhanced by Eric's vocals and Buck's solo guitar in it. <br /> <br />BORN TO BE WILD  The classic BOC live song they never wrote.  Poorly recorded, it's sometimes hard to find out exactly what they are all doing during the song.  I guess it might have been better to insert a live take of ODed ON LIFE ITSELF or DOMINANCE & SUBMISSION.  Or even a DVD of OYFOOYN to see what is exactly going on. <br />  <br />On the whole, this album closes a chapter of BOC's first wild and crazy era.  It is called the black and white period, where Blue Oyster Cult were the original bad boys your parents didn't want to even know about, much less listen to.  Nowadays, the Oyster Boys keep on rocking the house with fans ranging from teenaged kids to 40-somethings such as me and older.  I guess BOC's future may something on the order of selling out assisted living homes.  One thing is for sure...they don't look like they will ever retire from this.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I love the video, but will there ever be a CD version released?
B00005JOFQ|5.0|First of all, can I just say, \\"MY GOD\\" I haven't seen such a brilliantly made movie since \\"MILLION DOLLAR BABY\\", even though I do think Brokeback Mountain does surpass Million Dollar Baby, with regards to better acting and just an all around, a better movie. Even though Clint Eastwood is \\"THE MAN\\"! The title of my review expresses exactly how I was feeling when I left the theater.This is the tragic love story of two cowboys who fall in love while in the mountains of Brokeback. With the first love scene, it comes of as an unreasoning or an extravagant passion or attraction, which can be defined as INFATUATION. In the movie, we later on realize that, it's not infatuation at all, but something that goes much deeper. Something many of us don't like to say unless we truly meant it, something we call.... LOVE. Regardless of the fact that it is a love between two men, we as humans should understand because love is a universal emotion which everyone, straight or not, can understand and feel. Brokeback Mountain depicts every emotion we as humans feel; Love...sadness...fear...and anger. <br /> <br />I was blown away by the performances of all the cast members including Anne Hathaway, which many people basically forgot was in the movie. Even though I do agree with her not being nominated for an Oscar because her performance was the weakest. Honestly, as hard as it is to say, because Jake Gyllenhaal is my favorite actor EVER and probably one of the most underrated,(Even though people are starting to catch on to him now) although he's been great since DONNIE DARKO. Heath Ledger's performance was stronger and more powerful than Jake's. I feel as though if anyone should've won an Oscar, he should.(Damn u, Capote!). His performance was one of the best performances to ever not win an Oscar in the history of the academy awards. Although these are strong words, they are true. I have never seen Heath act with so much heart and, passion and take on a character who isn't even an embody that fictional character like he did in Brokeback Mountain. Unlike the other actors who were nominated, who had someone who they could mirror and were trying to portray which, is still great. But to become someone who doesn't even exist with such passion and raw talent it would've seemed as though there were really an Ennis del Mar!  <br /> <br />Now on to Jake and Michelle. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was incredible as Jack Twist in Brokeback Mountain. But everyone should remember that, just because your not crying in every scene, fighting a cause, or even screaming at people in a dramatic and emotional way, doesn't mean you can't create a powerful performance. Which is exactly what Jake did, he was subtle with a lot of his expressions and feelings, and wasn't aggressive in several scenes. For the main part, Jake was very subtle, to portray a character that was in love with another man, not by choice.Best said in this line,\\"I anit no queer,\\" said Ennis, Jack replies,\\"me neither.\\" His facial expressions and body language are priceless in the film, and those are attributes which not everyone possess. During these times an actor's real talent is shown, because its not always about how dramatic you can be. <br /> <br />Michelle Williams performance is heartbreaking to watch. She, like Heath, really did a '180'(degree)in terms of the fact that I wasn't really a huge fan of their acting, and they've just done wonders in this film. We get to see her go through the horrible experience of her having to come to terms with the fact that her husband is having an affair, and to make matters worse, with the possibility that he could be gay; with his affair having to be with another man. Also, how every time he goes away to fish with his friend, they are together in more than one way. Michelle's breakdown in the movie was nothing short of incredible and moving. She may not have won the Oscar, but she surely deserved it. But I guess that it all depends on the opinion of the viewers/critics. And finally Ang Lee; Wow. No words can describe how thankful I am to him for making this movie and having the courage to carry on even with all the obstacles he had to face trying to make the movie. Thank you for your genius idea because this movie could've easily been a disaster. Even though Brokeback was snubbed for best picture, they had to give it to you Ang because your directing was nothing short of brilliant.... Thank You with the dearest of appreciation. <br /> <br />Going to the movie, I was just expecting a great movie. But now thinking back, this was more than just a great movie. It was one of a kind, and probably will remain that way. I felt, basically, every emotion that Heath , Jake , Michelle , and even Anne felt. This may be a movie about tragedies, but the biggest tragedy was the Oscars showing there true colors; giving the best picture award to a movie that in its own right, was incredible but nowhere near on the same level, and as brilliantly made as Brokeback Mountain. This movie tears at your heart for 2 hrs and 15 mins, and with the way I, and probably many others, felt for many days to come.  <br /> <br />
B000003S16|5.0|This is an incredibly modern album even by today's standards, that manages to incorporate most types of rock...alternative, punk, while also sounding very King Crimson. I was blown away when I bought this one on vinyl.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|Not as dramatic as her last album, this is nonetheless worth having for anyone who enjoys Enya, or Celtic music in general.  Wonderful music for contemplation, relaxation or meditation.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|I have listenened to this record a million timess it seems to me now. When I first bought the LP this was a revelation. The trasfer to CD has never given the same pleasure somehow. I am now unto the 3rd or 4th copy of the album and still regularly listen to it today. While the themes of the pieces are very nice, their length does represent a problem. This is where The Apollo or even Music for Films records come off better. There is a slight lacl of variety here. OK ambient records are supposed to be repetitive...I know.

B000EQH2QK|5.0|The album Oral Fixation vol. 2 (with Bonus tracks)defines Shakira as the international superstar she has become. Now with the added version of La Tortura and the hit HIPS DON'T LIE featuring Wyclef Jean this release is the best vehicle for her to show the world all of her talents. This release is a new twist of the previous one and far better due to the new songs it includes. Even if you own Oral Fixation Vol. 2, your collection won't be complete without adding Vol. 2 (with bonus tracks). The song Hips Don't Lie has become a megahit overnight. This album is truly a must-have for all Shakira fans!
B00004TH6O|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age seem to have a natural ability to make great albums without compromising the ferocious sound that is their trademark.  On this album, they combine raw, fuzzed-out power with elements of psychedelia -- and it works!  The great thing about `Rated R' is that, although the production is fantastic, it doesn't sound too polished.  There is an intensity about this record that really comes through.  It is probably the best album to showcase the band's hard edge. There is not as much of the marketable catchiness of 'Songs for the Deaf' to be found here.  (Not that that was necessarily a bad thing, I found it quite appealing.) This is Queens at their most uncompromising.  Great songs, great band, great album!  Also, featured here is the band's frenetic and talented bassist, Nick Oliveri, who has since left the band.  It's a great shame, but some of his best work can be found here.  I also recommend buying 'Songs for the Deaf', which finally earned the band some much deserved popularity.
B000ENWKN8|4.0|FIRST OFF, I KNOW THAT ROB ZOMBIE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANY INTENTION MAKING ANOTHER ALBUM. READING THE NEW ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE, ROB ALSO STATED THAT HIS NEW ALBUM WOULDN'T HAVE THE USE COMPUTERS OR ANYTHING THAT RELATES TO THE INDUSTRIAL GENRE.

0441008615|4.0|Mr. Gaiman and Mr. Pratchett have combined their talent in creating a wild fiction about good and evil, angel and demon, friend and foe. The first half is full of eleven years worth of events leading up to the final day. A lot happen on the last day of the world which fills up the second half of the book. Many odd and witty characters are introduced in the book but a reader could easily pick out the important ones as they move along pretty quickly throughout the story. The roles consist of humans, angels, demons, nuns, mothers, fathers, aliens, witches, animals, voice of god, and such. The list provided after the \\"In the beginning\\" chapter is quite useful too. Thus, an antichrist is delivered to earth as a baby, seen by a fallen angel and a group of satanic nuns. Confusion ensues and eleven years pass where incidents are surely to take place - most of them amusing. During the last day of the promised apocalypse more bizarre occurrences continue to entertain the reader. The ending is simply tied together quite nicely. Mr. Gaiman's and Mr. Pratchett's humor is definitely worth the time of a reader who appreciates fun and drollness in their fantasies.

We debated about ordering it and decided to anyway, despite the quality, because my daughter absolutely loves the stories. <br /> <br />Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised to find the book was in excellent shape. I could see where the binding had originally been made poorly, but they had rebound the book very well correcting the problem. We are very pleased with it and I recommend this book to anyone with children young and old. I still like the stories even at 40 and remember when my parents use to read them to me. <br />

B000092ZYX|5.0|Being someone whose musical tastes didn't really awaken until midway through high school(2002), I've had sort of a fractured take on Radiohead. Like anyone alive during the 90s, I heard nothing but glowing reviews of the band wherever I went, but I'd never personally listened to them and neither had my friends(Uncultured I know, so sue me, I live in the middle of Michigan for crying out loud), so I ended up getting defensive toward the whole idea of accepting them. \\"What do the critics know?\\" -Lots of the teen rebellion and whatnot.<br /><br />Anyway, I eventually decided that it was foolish to ignore the advice of experts, and after a somewhat limited Amazon.com research session, picked up OK Computer in the winter of my Freshman year in college. I loved it, finding it in fact to be nothing like anything else I had ever listened to - epic and deep, beautiful and paranoid, comforting and frightening - a spectacular album.<br /><br />Over time I worked my way through the rest of the Radiohead discography, first back to The Bends (The soulful, angsty, accessible one), and then forward to the tripped-out, apocalyptic adventure of Kid A, which felt like being an alien in a spaceship and watching the Earth itself crumble away.<br /><br />Now, a year later, I reach Hail To The Thief, the end of the line, and I find myself wondering, what does it have to say?<br /><br />I'm not going to pretend to be a total expert on Radiohead, after all, I didn't get into them until a year ago, and I still don't own Amnesiac or Pablo Honey. However, in that short year they've become my favorite band, and I've come to admire the creativity and vision they seem to represent peerlessly with every album.<br /><br />One of the things I've admired the most is the way that each successive album, from The Bends to OK Computer and especially Kid A, has broken new ground and done something musically that no one expected. So, when I learned about Hail To The Thief, I was surprised and a little worried to learn that it seemed to lack a cohesive direction. I (ever pessimistic) was afraid that it was a simple and tragic story of a band stagnating at the end of its creative journey. Maybe it is - I suppose only time will tell.<br /><br />However, more than anything else, Radiohead's newest album feels like a crossroads. It borrows elements from all their previous work, and puts them in the same context to compare and reflect on. The theme may be the confusion and anxious mistrust arising in the \\"Post-911\\" world of today, but individual songs take on the general shapes of things past. There are sweeping, multi-part OK Computer style pieces like \\"2+2=5,\\" \\"Sit Down, Stand Up,\\" and \\"Sail To The Moon.\\"  There are sleek, cold electronic tracks like \\"Backdrifts,\\" \\"The Gloaming,\\" and \\"Myxomatosis\\" that continue the trend set by Kid A and Amnesiac. There are stripped down, heartfelt songs like \\"There There,\\" \\"Scatterbrain,\\" and \\"A Wolf At The Door\\" that call to mind The Bends.<br /><br />All in all, Hail To The Thief seems to me like a sort of spiritual \\"greatest hits\\" collection. A look back, a moment of remembrance, and a gift to all the long-time fans that have experienced Radiohead's musical journey every step of the way since the beginning. A moment taken to acknowledge that, whatever past accomplishments they represent, whatever the future may hold, Radiohead are, simply, an excellent band, whether they have something pioneering to say or not.hesive direction.

B00092ZL80|5.0|the music is what sets the stage. with majority of its members in their 60's, chicago is simply inspirational. you have got to appreciate their music composition in its full depth, variations and dynamics if nothing else. their performance is pure precision. sure, EW&F interacts with its audiences more but its music in no way can surmount chicago's -- technical and yet overladen with such graceful melody. however the two bands together just simply bring out magic. nowhere else can you enjoy six horns, three superb guitars and two bass. EW&F are movie star musicians. chicago is just simply superb musicians and every member in the band is a Bach. everyone should own this DVD. Rock on Chicago!
B000002L68|5.0|Purple Rain is one of those albums that is so etched into your subconscious that it's almost hard to remember a time when the album wasn't in existance.   It's been twenty-two years and the album still sells (it's sold 2.5 million in the era of Soundscan, more than any other Prince album).  It's something that my mom threw out with the garbage when she listened to... but as soon as I got a few years older, went and rebought it, and for the past 15 years, my collection has never not had Purple Rain in it in some form. <br /> <br />I find it funny to see trolls coming in here and trashing the album in favor of tuneless music like Tool and Rage Against The Machine.  I tried to get into both bands when I was younger... I couldn't,  yet Prince's music, including Purple Rain, has been a constant in my life since grade school.   Anyone who doesn't hear this album as a five-star masterpiece is deaf, especially if you favor nonsense to this.
B000002G0P|5.0|Extreme is one of those bands that always produces great music. The main reason for this is the awesome talent of guitarist Nuno Bettencourt. He is astounding - he plays wicked guitar, he writes and arranges all the music, he sings, and he produces. You will experience everything Nuno has to offer on this album and it will make you search out all his other work. I can't begin to describe how awesome this music is, you have to hear it for yourself. This is for people who love high quality rock music with virtuoso guitar playing and amazing songwriting. As a musician, I really do think that Nuno is one of those people who just oozes creativity and virtuosity. There's is nothing he can't do. I've seen him live and he plays even the most difficult passages with ease. He truly is a gifted musician. If you're interested you should also check out his other stuff including Mourning Widows, Population 1, and Dramagods.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Five Stars isn't enough to shine light on one of the greatest American films about America's (the world's) greatest fictional character of all time.  Superman The Movie packs a heavyweight punch from beginning to end:    Christopher Reeve as SUPERMAN...\\"I'll mold this box into your prison bars\\"...Gene Hackman as LEX LUTHOR...\\"Mind over Muscle\\"...Marlon Brando as JOR-EL...\\"Neither I, nor my wife, will leave Krypton\\"...Margot Kidder as LOIS LANE...\\"So you're totally impervious to pain?\\" Jackie Cooper as PERRY WHITE...\\"Nice job on that jewelry scandle Kent\\"...And who could forget the powerful, lush, and romantic compositions of John Williams, (a character unto itself in this film).  All of this artistry coordinated, and directed by the master...Richard Donner.    This is my favorite movie of all time...and I don't say that lightly.  If you've never seen it, you're missing an epic adventure like no other.  ENJOY Superman The Movie today...PURCHASE it from Amazon.com (or other fine retailers) NOW....\\"And don't call me sugar!\\".
B00005JO20|4.0|you probably already knew that considering the original is the greatest monster movie ever made. still this remake is a good try and peter jackson has obviously become one of the better film makers in the world. the remake closely follows  the original movie's storyline but is twice as long. the added stuff doesn't improve the story which was from a very different era and is more than slightly out of date. the story doesn't retell well. there's also something off about the tone or attitude of this version. probably it's naomi watts' charactor's ridiculous attitude toward the monster. she seems to be in love with it. maybe jack black is miscast as well. in the original movie carl denham (black's charactor) was a risk taking, visionary tough guy. in this one he's a slightly comical, conniving con man. anyway, this was a very difficult assignment for jackson (on the order of a remake of frankenstein) and he did a pretty good job. the movie is at least visually spectacular. for those who have never seen it, check out the original KING KONG and see what i mean about it being the greatest monster movie ever made. it's much better than this remake.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I live to far away from New York to have ever gotten the chance to see this on Broadway, but I did listen to the soundtrack several years ago of the Original Cast, so when I heard a film version was coming out I was excited to see it for the first time. <br /> <br />I could not have been more moved by this film. Alot of people tried to tell me not to see this because of the many issues it addresses such as gays, lesbians, AIDS, drug addictions,cross dressing and so on and so forth. I feel people who look at this in a small minded view will not see the beautiful story it tells.  <br /> <br />I believe this film captured me from the moment of silence before \\"Seasons of Love\\" started until the very end when my eyes were so filled with tears that I couldnt hold back. I feel like I know each of the characters personally. they are people I could know and hang out with and who would deal with my hardships and I would deal with theirs. <br /> <br />It is artistic, real, beautiful, and reverent when it deals with the support group when it could have turned sappy and to mushy for me to feel connected to or even understand. I thank Chris Columbus for that.  <br /> <br />Overall, it has to be one of the best films I have ever seen.......EVER. <br /> <br />Thank you Jonathan Larson for you music!
B000002LQR|5.0|Wow, this album brings back memories, I remember listening to it non stop in the early 90's when I was only about 10 years old.  I bought it after hearing Under The Bridge & Give It Away, and it doesn't dissapoint, all 17 tracks are worth listening to.  However I stopped listening to The Chili Peppers some time ago, and haven't been overly impressed with their recent efforts, but I found this cd while searching through my house last week.  It had been over 10 years since I last gave it a proper listen so I wasn't sure what to expect, my music tastes have changed a lot in that time, my music collection now consists almost entirely of hiphop, in fact I generally dislike rock music and hate rap/rock with a passion.  Thankfully though I still love this album, I instantly remembered every track and I have been playing it since, it is staying in my collection.<br /><br />Whether or not you are a Chili Peppers fan or even a fan of the genre you should still listen to this album once.  People generally try to put this music into one genre, but they clearly draw their influences from many different types of music, from funk, rap and rock.  In fact the reason why I found this so easy to get into is probably because I love funk & funk inspired music as well as the rap elements of this album.  While you couldn't really say Anthony Keidis is a great rapper or singer there is something about the way he brings his lyrics across that I have always liked.  There are also genuinely meaningful lyrics written by him particularly on the ballad type tracks such as Under The Bridge & I could Have Lied.  The music is excellent mostly bass driven by Flea, and has a very funky sound to it, for my money this is by far their best album, though I can't comment on all their early work.  The album contains a great mix of ballads & up-tempo tracks and from The Power of Equality through to Theyr'e Red Hot it's all excellent.  If I had to pick favourite tracks i'd go with Breaking The Girl, I Could Have Lied, Give It Away, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Under The Bridge & Apache Rose Peacock.  This is a classic album that has stood the test of time (and will continue to), fans of any music should enjoy this album, superb.d Have Lied, Give It Away, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Under The Bridge & Apache Rose Peacock.

Repeatedly. <br />Just tired of films about drugs and users and that entire scene.  <br />Shot in that annoying MTV music-video style. <br />When will directors learn to stop swirling the camera and allow the actors to do what they were hired to do?  <br />Not a complicated concept at all, filmmakers. Leave the actors alone. That's right: point the camera at  them and let them show that they can act. How about that? If they can't act, hire someone who can--but please stop the idiotic camera tricks. Tony Scott does it, Tarantino does it, Robert Rodriguez does it... Why? Because they don't trust their minimal talent. That's exactly why. <br />You're giving us a headache, man. Get it? If I want my brain to ache I'll take a rollercoaster ride.
B0000AR8NK|2.0|I just recently felt compelled to write a review of this for some reason.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of this man, so I'm biased.  His innovative note<br /><br />combination/chord structure stylings are unparalleled in pop music.<br /><br /> I, like many other \\"critics\\", try not to compare albums.  I just look for creativity. Ok,<br /><br />Reality, the latest offering.  To be blunt, (and I'm sorry to say, as I wanted to love it)<br /><br />it's not very creative from a note perspective.  The tone colors are unique, but the notes themselves aren't.<br /><br />Not a bad album, just not the kind of innovation we have come to expect (expectations = murder).<br /><br /> As some reviewers have mentioned, I was surprised at the lack of emotion on this.  The<br /><br />melodies are fairly flat at times (\\"New Killer Star\\", I'm looking at you; this song is<br /><br />barely listenable... ) and some of the lyrics are silly (\\"Ready, Set, Go!\\"??? Yikes!).<br /><br /> For a bit of a modern context, Outside is great, Earthling blows me away, and I think BTWN, Hours, and Heathen<br /><br />are damn good.<br /><br /> This album is worth owning, if you're ever in the mood for basic, semi-interesting rock.  However, I am hoping he<br /><br />does a little better next time (emotionally, at least).<br /><br /> On a side note, don't watch that \\"Reality Tour\\" DVD. It will just make you depressed. :)

B00005JOE8|5.0|I read the graphic novel of \\"V for Vendetta\\" when it was originally  released in the mid 1980s. Right from the beginning, I could see that this was Alan Moore's homage to Orwell and \\"1984\\" - he was most likely inspired by the book as the title's date approached and Moore observed Thatcher's England and Reagan's America unfold. What an amazing story \\"V for Vendetta\\" told. Alan Moore saw that Fascism was still alive and well in the world of 1984 as it was in Orwell's Post WWII 1940s.<br /><br />Jump forward 20 years, and we have a retelling of this amazing story, but this time on film instead of the comic panel. In this day and age of Terrorism, the fear of Terrorism, and the Fascist use of that fear, the story is more important than ever in Bush's America/World. Fear is the most powerful tool of the fascist as has been demonstrated in both the real world - Nazi Germany and Post 9/11 America - and in fiction - \\"1984\\" and \\"V for Vendetta\\".  \\"V for Vendetta\\" capture's this by potraying a not-to-distant future where plague and terrorism have crippled the world and are  cooped by the fearful conservative right (where all fascism is born as they are similar psychoses) to control the masses and \\"protect\\" the people.<br /><br />Though Moore set \\"V\\" in his native England, 20 years after its writing it could have been set in Post 9/11 America where even treehugging is consider terrorism by the ruling administration. Yes, this film portrays a terrorist as the \\"good guy\\", but it actually delves deeper into the heart of all of us; and it challenges every one of us to stand up for ourselves BEFORE we would need to resort to acts of violence to safeguard our freedoms - or worse have to reclaim them. Watch this film to be inspired for what we have to loose, before it becomes what we have lost.<br /><br />A final note on Alan Moore not endorsing the film...Moore doesn't endorse any of his works being made into film. But, I would like to think that he will see it and see his vision properly realized; this is what I saw in the film...his vision on screen (though I was disappointed that the musical numbers found in the graphic novel were missing!). With this film, I await \\"The Watchmen\\" even more.ion properly realized; this is what I saw in the film...his vision on screen (though I was disappointed that the musical numbers found in the graphic novel were missing!).

B0000CABBW|1.0|This is my number one most overrated movie of all time.  We saw it at a pretensious artsy theater, along with an assortment of ex-hippies and wooly haired intellectuals.  They all cheered, of course, when the young girl beats the boys at finding the prize in the water, then becomes the chief.  The truth is that every single scene is utterly predictable, given the politically correct theme.  The truth is that old people are not bad just because they love their culture.  The truth is that tradition is not inherently evil.  The truth is that girls are no better or worse than boys.  Basically, if you hate men, this is the flick for you.  But it is not good.  It is not creative.  There are no surprises.  There is just nothing there.  As I edit this, it's no surprise to find so few people liked this review.  There are still plenty of hippies and politically correct so-and-so's out there.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|Let us go over the 'facts' about this band: <br /> <br />1. They were signed prior to EVER performing a live show.  This is not something to brag about.  This simply shows they have no idea how to actually play music, and the sacchrine studio sheen that glosses the mix of this album attests to the fact that these boys probably never really learned to play these songs until after the studio treatment. <br /> <br />2. They have very 'original' lyrics.  As far as I know, the singer does not even write these lyrics (one of the other band members does).  So, you have a teenage wannabe poet letting a pretty face/voice try to cram all these unwieldy phrases and ideas into 3 minute bubblegum pop.  This is not good.  In fact it's plain embarrassing and awkward to listen to at times. <br /> <br />3. They are the first band signed by Pete Wentz's Decaydence label (an imprint of Fueled By Ramen).  Again, this is no amazing  feat, made even less amazing by the fact that the average listener would be hard pressed to tell the two bands apart if they were not familiar with the songs.  Fall Out Boy signed a band that sounded just_like_them.  Whoopee. <br /> <br />The bottom line is, this is immature music made by immature songwriters and to claim this album is anything more than a massive miscalculation and/or overreach by some indulgent teenagers is disingenuous or plain retarded.  Someone please slap some sense into these kids.
B000026258|5.0|For those fortunate to have viewed the film THE DYING GAUL either in the theater or on the DVD now on the shelves, the music of Steve Reich struck all of the right moods and lent the support and atmosphere  to make this the fine film it is.  Hoping that the Soundtrack from the movie will be available eventually, at least for now this very fine recording of STEVE REICH: MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS  will suffice.<br /><br />Reich as been around for a long time and has been affiliated with the LA Philharmonic, recently honored in the Minimalist Jukebox Series.  This recording serves as an excellent introduction to his music - some of the most important of the minimalist school.  His ability to cover the vast range of repeated sounds and rhythms so that the performed work never ceases to both float the mind and expand horizons with the delicately nuanced changes is well demonstrated in this excellent recording.<br /><br />Steve Reich has a strong following among new music lovers and it seems secure to say that he definitely has staying power.

B000002UR7|5.0|Ok. First of all I'm a big Radiohead fan. I have most of their albums (still have to find Amnesiac and Hail To The Theif) including The Bends & OK Computer. Now don't get me wrong, if i had to choose which album from them I would pick, i would say ALL of them. This band ROCKS!!!! But if you want to know my personal favorate from them, I would say Pablo Honey. \\"WHAT!!!\\"  <br />\\"THAT PIECE OF CRAPPY RUBBISH OF A DEBUT????\\" \\"WHY NOT THE BENDS OR OK COMPUTER???\\" Didn't I just say that ALL their albums rock? Yeah I did. But everyone always has some personal favorate in their collection, I don't care what kind. And to me, my personal favorate is Pablo Honey. The guitars are amazing, Thom's voice is incredible, and his lyrics are honest and streight to the point. Lyricly I can relate to Thom's lyrics, as I too am a 'Creep'. And eventhough the drums sounds are a little low, they only add to the intensity of each song.  <br /> <br />Every song on this album is just amazing. Especally Creep. A song I can realate too. But Creep isn't the only song to behold in greatness. songs like the guitar catchy \\"How Do You?\\", the lyricly urgent and guitar great \\"Stop Wishpering\\", the heart-broke acoustic balled \\"Thinking About You\\", and the emotionaly soothing \\"Lurgree\\" all have their own intensity to bring to the listener.  <br /> <br />Personally I would recommend Pablo Honey for die hard fans, but if you're looking for Kid A/Amnesiac or even OK Computer Radiohead, then stear clear of this album 'cause you wouldn't like what you'll hear. But if you're a die hard fan like me, then get ALL of their albums, including this amazing debut by one of the greatest innovaters in Rock music.
B000E6GBV2|5.0|Melancholy, shimmering, at times suffused with adolescent angst, these pop tunes have been compared to My Morning Jacket. But I think the comparison is only valid in terms of sensibility. If you like this type of plaintive alternative rock which often dwells on loss, longing, and alienation, you might also want to check out these other likeminded bands: Rogue Wave, Big Phony, Fan Modine, Destoyer, Run Chico Run, Page France, Midlake, Easter River Pipe, and The Decemberists.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Mixed feelings about this one. OK, let's see now. <br /> <br />This is without a doubt, their darkest album ever, even more so than Black Celebration. A deep, heavy brooding atmosphere is present in almost all the tracks. Keeps you longing for even more of the sinister stuff that they used to create earlier on!  <br /> <br />Honestly, I still prefer Exciter. It was more intelligent, with a better sounding production and songs that got stronger as they progressed. I feel that some of the songs here build up but finally stop short of delivering that final hook that floors you.  <br /> <br />This album contains bits of almost all their previous albums, from Construction Time again to Exciter (I intentionally left out Speak & Spell). While I do not like artistes to fall back on earlier stuff, these guys have done it so well and upped the \\"darkness\\" level, and completely turned everything on its head.  <br /> <br />On the whole, a very solid Depeche Mode album but not their best.  Don't get me wrong. This is very, very good stuff and very highly recommended, but I did expect a little more from them. These guys however, will always be way ahead of their time.

He learns everything quickly, becomes a leader in every situation, and is eventually put into a position for which he was meant.<br /><br />A related genius subplot is that of Ender's siblings, Peter and Valentine, both of whom help to deliver different aspects to the story.  They show Ender's weak side and his strong side, which may or may not be the same.  Peter and Valentine also help to develop what might be the overall moral to the story.  Is it love?  Is it forgiveness?<br /><br />Ender's Game is a great read that will have any reader dreaming about the battleroom, trying to devise the strategy that will defeat the other combatants.  It's a wonderful, imaginative, and thoughtful \\"can't put down\\" book.
B000E97HIA|5.0|I wish that I could give this CD more stars.  This is one of the best CDs Prince has ever released!!!  The album is perfect.  This CD is way better than Musicology. I listen to the CD all of the time.  My favorite track is definitely 'The Word\\".  The song has a DEEP message and the music behind it is perfect.  I have listened to that track so many times, I can not count.  If you are a true Prince fan, you definitely NEED this CD!!!
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Peter Jackson's King Kong is an marvelous achievement that carries astonishing clarity and vision within every frame. 2005 was a year that saw cinematic masterpieces such as Capote and Munich, but King Kong successfully embodies and often elevates to a new level the elements of storytelling, action, and visual effects that made cinema emerge as the 20th century's premier art form. <br /> <br />King Kong seizes on the story provided by the 1933 original and expands upon it in the way some great films bring novels to a vibrant life no one could have imagined the material was capable of. Taking place during the Great Depression, we meet Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a struggling actress and performer. She has a good heart, but her life has been little more than a series of crippling disappointments. In a seemingly divine stroke of luck, movie producer Carl Denham (Jack Black) approaches Ann on the street, offering her the chance to star in one of his films. Unbeknownst to her, Denham's plans are to travel the Pacific in search of a mysterious island, misleading both film and ship crews to get there.  <br /> <br />The voyage to Skull Island receives most of the first hour of screen time, but never does it become tedious. Jackson's characters are likeable and clear, the dialogue never attempting to be clever or flashy, but a perfect component to lay out the action ahead. Already a good film, the film rushes forward at breakneck pace upon reaching Skull Island, never missing a step or skipping a beat. Skull Island may be the most malevolent location ever put to film, replete with vile monsters that could each serve as their own horror series. <br /> <br />When King Kong (Andy Sekris) finally arrives, he occupies the screen with a dazzling sense of power and flawless movement.  Sekris, who did the fabulous movements of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, works with special effects to bring the giant ape to life in way that outshines that of most human actors.  <br /> <br/>Outwardly vicious and intimidating, Kong grows attached to Ann. She performs her vaudeville act for Kong, an enthusiastic audience who may not have ever received kind attention from another being. We slowly realize the two share a sort of connection that goes deeper than words. Both are outcasts in their societies, living solitary existences defined primarily by their physical traits. Kong protects Ann from the appalling creatures on Skull Island, and after the humans capture the great beast, Ann tries to protect him. <br /> <br />The knockout action sequences come furiously during the film's latter 2/3's, utilizing state of the art f/x and imagination for all they are worth. During one breathtaking sequence, Kong battles three tyrannosaurs rex's while holding Ann in alternating hands, while in another terrifying sequence, the film crew comes under assault from thousands of disgusting insects. Each sequence would likely be the highlight of the average film, but when Kong runs amok in New York City, the exhilarating payoff never falls short of awe-inspiring.  <br /> <br />Peter Jackson has come a long way. Originally known as the director of cult horror schlock such as Dead Alive, he shot to worldwide fame as the driving force behind the superb Lord of the Rings films. With King Kong, he proves himself to be an artist with phenomenal potential to add his name to the lexicon of great filmmakers.   <br /> <br />When Kong brings Ann to the stop of the Empire State building, he looks longingly at her, his deepest sadness being that their time together has run out, and I tearfully felt the same way. Roger Ebert often states \\"No bad film is short enough, while no good film is long enough.\\" These words rang true throughout my psyche as this exciting, wonderful, deeply sad, and beautiful film came to a close. <br />
B000002UVX|5.0|Between raw and refined it's the perfect sugar rock candy baby. Hard and hurts your mouth. Right here blues and soul met like the origin of rock did in a tent after the preacher went home. Blues from a paratrooper back when vet blues were heard sweetheart. Do you hear them now? No matter what version, this rock has already hit you.
B0001LYH9S|4.0|I'm a huge Bowie fan (Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust probably my favorites) until now. OUTSIDE kinda took me by surprise, but not in a bad way. Bowie's music on this record is a quirky and addictive combination of an old school Nine Inch Nails sound, jazz, and some trippy sci-fi storylines.     'The Hearts Filthy Lesson', 'Hallo Spaceboy', and 'No Control' have that vintage Nine Inch Nails feel, however, Bowie manages to create a unique new take on the music because of his amazing vocal abilities and eccentric, jazzy sci-fi undertones. This album is great and proves once and for all how truly brilliant Trent Reznor is at this type of music. ('The Downward Spiral' came out the year before this!!!)    This album is a all of 77 minutes and there are some shortcomings. The first half the album is absolutely brilliant and has few weak spots. However, the album ends extremely poorly with some poppy 80s type sounds and music. (reason for the 1 star deduction) As far as the spoken voice overs, I kinda ejoyed them because they're so strange.    Otherwise, this album is must own and is right now........my favorite Bowie album.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|This was the first disc that possessed me with the rythms between Jordan, John P, and John M. Atop all of it is Mike and James who seriously deal the final blow. The first song that hooked me was \\"This Dying Soul\\", which i won't go too into because it has different stages within the song, which is a very different thing amidst todays mainstream. Although Opeth have the same effect i feel that this is much cleaner and proves effective in it's own right.<br /><br />Anyways i pursued the rest of the CD with hopes of more tunes, only to be bored stale. How can such a CD with such potential be brought down with blandness? This is a nightmare, but there are better, which keeps this Dream alive.<br /><br />Other song I liked was actually \\"In The Name...\\", which has this Middle Eastern tune i can't get out of my head, i just feel like dancing to it or something like that. Whatever just don't buy this CD try and find a way to hear both full songs of \\"This Dying Soul\\" and \\"In The Name Of God\\" they are the best on here (when i mean \\"find a way to hear\\" i mean download them).<br /><br />Listen to some of their earlier stuff just before this it will not submit to mediocrity like this did. Also heard that Octavarium wasn't anything special either, but i don't know too well yet.
B0006IJ5PM|5.0|Hey everybody this is a really great movie. If you are looking for a football movie that has great actors and such you have found it.
B00070DK1E|4.0|Great return to form by the Tull after the lacking Under Wraps. The atmosphere, the music are the reasons this one is worth buying. Budapest is a great composition along with others such as Steel Monkey. The whole package including the cover makes me smile. Thanks Tull!
B00005KHJM|4.0|This is not what most people would call a horror film, yet the situation created in the movie is indeed horrific.  Being on this island is like being stuck in the Twilight Zone, where everyone has gone mad and no one will listen to reason. The strange beliefs and rituals of the residents of this island painfully stretch the imagination of the God-fearing Sergeant Howie. He is shocked at every turn by what he sees and experiences, but he remains determined to fulfill his duty: to find the missing child.  <br /> <br />The Wicker Man is quite a unique film. The tone set on the island is morose and dark, layered beneath a seemingly happy culture of \\"flower children\\" dancing and making love in the fields. This is the type of movie that truly makes you think.  You feel as though you are Sergeant Howie, trapped on this island where common sense seems to be sharply askew - where you are essentially on your own. <br /> <br />The end sequence of this movie is quite disturbing. This begins with the May Day ceremony, where the townspeople dress in costumes and proceed to the mountaintops. The whole aura of the scene is unsettling. It is here that the plot unfolds and the horrifying intent of the people of this island is revealed. The final scene is gripping and distressing. Very well done.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Why was the Pink Floyd Pulse DVD release delayed yet again? Hear the truth from David Gilmour himself.     David Gilmour Speaks! from the May 2006 issue of Guitar World magazine (Vol. 27/No. 5), \\"Shine On\\" an interview by Alan Di Perna. The following is a full quote from the interview concerning the Pulse DVD release (pp.96-98):    \\"GW: Speaking of live shows, why is the Pulse DVD coming out later this year, some 12 years after the Division Bell tour?    GILMOUR: It was out on VHS long ago. We had a lot of technical problems converting it to DVD. It was shot on video rather than film, which I now think was a mistake: it doesn't look very good when you enlarge it on a big screen television, which everyone seems to have these days. We'd been investigating all sorts of ways to digitally enhance the footage.    By the time we'd surmounted all the problems, it was way too late to make our November or December ['05] deadline. I didn't see any point in putting it out at the same time as my album (On An Island), so I asked that we put the release back until September\\".      Nuff Said.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|I don't use that word in normal discourse, but this movie is certainly deserving of it.    The effects are simply masterful. Kong is a REAL character, created and brought to life with the magic of CGI. The movements are thoroughly ape-like and Kong is given a unique personality. The imagination that went into this is unreal. The other inhabitants of Skull Island are also extremely impressive. Jackson and crew have created a surreal prehistoric land of mystery and wonder. Truly amazing.    The drama is touching, as experienced in the relationship shared by Kong and Ann. There are a few scenes in this movie that are immensely moving, such as when Kong is captured on Skull Island, when Kong discovers ice amidst his chase through the city and, of course, Kong's final stand atop the Empire State Building. You will truly feel for this beast who has been horribly exploited by man. All he wants is to care for and protect Ann and yet because of the greed of man, he now faces impossible odds for his own survival. The final scene is done wonderfully. I mean, you really feel a sense of impending dread as you watch Kong corner himself to be alone with and care for Ann. It's quite tragic.    This is a staggering movie achievement.    The bonus disc includes hours of material.  There is a featurette concerning the history of Skull Island, a featurette about 1933 New York City and the Post-Production Diaries, covering all areas of post-production of this film.  The making of this epic tale was an amazing undertaking - and it has all been well-documented. The bonus disc provides great supplemental material that is worth seeing.
B000056C6D|5.0|No further good words 'bout this masterpiece of West-Coast-Beat-Generation record!!! Time Out is one of the warmest and lyrical jazz record ever.

B0006399FS|4.0|...Except for those that either hate U2 outright, or believe this is the greatest U2 album ever.<br /><br />I will admit this is not my typical review style, maybe more of a rant than an observation, or maybe I'm just feeling fatigued with U2 overall.<br /><br />Have been a fan since Unforgettable Fire, and in all honesty, Joshua Tree was the album that got me through the darkest days of my life, it actually made me believe in hope and redemption, it had that much power in the sheer soundscapes it created.<br /><br />Achtung Baby was equally brilliant, and I relished in the darker, re-structured U2, what other band truly has been able to reinvent themselves and succesfully pull it off as U2 did?<br /><br />Even loved Zooropa & Passengers, for the experimental departures that sometimes worked, and sometimes fell short, but at least they were still experimenting with new sounds.<br /><br />PoP was an enigma, some good tracks, but the whole \\"Irony wrapped in a K-Mart\\" blanket bit was uninspiring. It was IMHO their weakest album up to that point, but with all they have done, they are entitled to a bit of a flop (although it's not as bad IMHO as some believe, but certainly not legendary).<br /><br />Then ATYCLB comes, a fair album with some decent tracks, but lacking any real imaginative soundscapes, deep passion, and other traits that I had come to expect from U2 without fail. Even when the entire music industry would be crumbling, I always believed that there would at least always be U2 standing proudly above the ruins.<br /><br />Now we have HTDAAB, and for the most part it sounds exactly like ATYCLB, unimaginative and complacent, dry and without any REAL passion or anger, even the essential U2 \\"Protest/Angry\\" track that accompanies most albums, in this case \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", sounds so contrived that it's more amusing than inspiring.<br /><br />There are two brilliant, or at least very good, tracks on this album, and two good ones:<br /><br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\" at least has the anthemic quality that U2 made their mark with, and is a great track. \\"Miracle Drug\\" does harkon back to Achtung, and that is a good thing.<br /><br />\\"Crumbs from your Table\\" and \\"SYCMIOYO\\" are polar opposites, but are both good tracks in their own ways.<br /><br />The rest, well it's filler, dilluted to the point of mediocrity.<br /><br />What does that mean for me?

B000002KHF|5.0|I agree with one of the previous reviewers. i cant beleive that there isnt a remastererd version of this album. i have had this cd for years but just wanted a new one cause the one i have has gotten really beat up over the years. such an amazing album cant believe there is no remastererd edition.
B00000FCBC|2.0|I've never been a fan of Metallica. I like Ride The Lightening, Master of Puppets, and that's it. That's the extent of my enjoyment with their abilities. <br /> <br />However, if there is one quality I've always admired in Metallica, it is their lyrics. They've always had excellent lyrics in their songs, and that was what got me to keep buying albums. <br /> <br />However, I can't credit them for any lyrics on this one. Unfortunately, we're dealing with a bunch of covers. <br /> <br />Some of the songs are pretty good. The only one I can say I really like is Turn The Page, though Seger's original version is leaps and bounds ahead of it. It's got decent music, and the vocals aren't bad. Metallica just couldn't figure out how to honor a classic, and they occasionally sounded like James was trying to lift a thousand pounds while he sang, leading his voice to sound overly forced. <br /> <br />Other songs, like Killing Time, were not spared on this album. Unlike with Turn The Page, Metallica didn't even do a halfway decent job covering this. They destroyed a pretty good song. And to be honest, Metallica's guitarist just can't compete with Sweet Savage's (Vivian Campbell??). <br /> <br />Tuesday's Gone was also destroyed. It was too slow and acoustic, but not in the good way it was in the Skynyrd original. In this case, James' voice was terrible. It sounded like he was bleeding the entire time and trying to ignore it. That is, at least, the effect I get from it. <br /> <br />Overall, if you're a die hard fan, you won't like this. It just doesn't have what Metallica did have for songs back with Ride The Lightening and Master of Puppets. If you're just looking for some Metallica, you might as well get this. As long as you are just a small fan, and not a huge one. <br /> <br />Otherwise, this may come as a dissapointment.
B00003CXAW|5.0|Thought the reivew I thought was really good, I had a few gripes with it.   <br /> <br />1. Naomi Watts not better then Fay Wray?  COME ON!  Watts sold me on every second of the new Kong.  Plus, she had the harder acting job, compared to Wray.  In the 30s, Kong did look obviously fake, so the audience took this with a grain of salt.  But, now that the computerized Kong looks, on the whole, realistic, Naomi Watts has the MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TASK of keeping the illusion alive for the diagetic world of the story, as well as to hook the audience in.  Also, for the scenes where she is not wearing a coat in the middle of winter in the city, maybe the warmth from Kong's palm while in his clutch heated her up enough.  Maybe when you are on top of the Empire State building and planes are firing at a 25 foot monkey, the last thing you are thinking about is if you are hot or cold.  Or, maybe it is a movie, and you should just drop it.   <br /> <br />2. Why not include the battle with the snake?  etc?  Jackson was not trying to duplicate this film completely.  There would be no point in remaking it then.   <br /> <br />3. This leads me to the point of the love story.  While the S.D. reviewer brought up the love story reminded them of the 1970s Kong, I was in shock.  How can you compare the new 2005 version to that one?  Jackson's version of the infatuation between Kong and Ann was the right way of showing their relationship, where as the 70s version tried, but missed the mark.   <br /> <br /> <br />I realize I am writing a review for this version, the 1933 film.  I will say none of the other Kong's should be comapred to it.  This film is in a class, and a time of its own, and it is a certian special type of greatness.  I just think the 2005 Kong is a nice counterpart to this film, that makes the story its own, but also pays homage to the roots of its origin.
0802130208|4.0|A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole   A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is about an immensely overweight man who wears a green hunting cap over his balloon shaped head named Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius has many comical adventures and complains about anything he doesn't like or doesn't get to do. He must battle through life from getting a job to complaining about people that scare him. On top of all of this he still lives with his mom whom which spoils him every step of the way through his long, yet absurdly funny, journey he calls a life. Ignatius thinks that everyone surrounding has a problem whether it might be an oddity they may have or their customs of life and how they do it. He has trouble with landing a good job even though he has a master's degree. Ignatius can't even work at a hot dog stand withought ruining the job by eating the hot dogs and not paying!     In this book there are not that many things I disliked. In fact, there probably is only one thing I despised in this hilarious novel. The one and only thing I disliked about this book was the many characters in this book get confusing at times and made my head spin.     What I particularly enjoyed about this book was the descriptions of the characters. John Kennedy Toole did an amazingly excellent job describing the characters in such detail yet, at a comical fashion as well. I also enjoyed the real life accents and slang used in this book. This way of bringing out the characters gives them their own personality that is fairly realistic to the present. I really enjoyed Ignatius. Ignatius was just funny anywhere he went. Whatever Ignatius tried to do, it always ended up into something hysterical.      This book was one of the best novels I have read so far and really enjoyed the way John Kennedy Toole made all of the characters from Ignatius to Bartenders. This book was one big laugh all the way! Just the way the characters acted, talked, and their personality was hilarious.

B00005JOUM|3.0|Spike Lee's new film, \\"Inside Man,\\" stars Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier, a man who would like to move up in the police force.  Unfortunately, Internal Affairs suspects him of wrongdoing, and unless he vindicates himself, Frazier may never make Detective First Grade. He gets the chance to show off his expertise when his captain assigns him to negotiate with Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) who has organized what appears to be a major bank robbery.  After storming the bank and disabling the security cameras, Russell and his confederates take a large number of hostages.  If Detective Frazier can bring this standoff to a successful conclusion, it could provide his career with a needed boost.  However, there are several complicating factors that make the situation extremely volatile.<br /><br />The head of the bank, Arthur Case, portrayed with suave malevolence by Christopher Plummer, is very worried about something that he has stored in one of the safe deposit boxes, and he hires Madeline White (Jodi Foster) to protect his interests. In addition, Dalton Russell's unpredictable behavior stymies Frazier, who is not quite sure what the man is really after.  Everyone in the film appears to have his or her own secret agenda, and the viewer is too often left in the dark.<br /><br />\\"Inside Man\\" is a flashy film with many weird camera angles, loud, jarring music, and a headache-inducing script by Russell Gewirtz.  Denzel Washington is effective as a savvy and courageous hostage negotiator who senses that this is no ordinary heist.  Jodi Foster has very little to do as an icy and smug woman with important contacts and a shadowy vocation that is never fully explained.  Dalton Russell is also a cipher; his motives remain a mystery until very late in the film.  Willen Dafoe is underutilized as Captain John Darius, a cop who is anxious to storm the bank with his SWAT team.<br /><br />The main problem with \\"Inside Man\\" is that the characters, with the exception of Detective Frazier, are remote and one-dimensional.  Even the most clever film needs to engage the viewer emotionally at some level if it is to succeed.  \\"Inside Man\\" is a puzzle that one wants to solve, but once you leave the theater and try to figure out what you just saw, you will soon forget about it.

B00000DQSS|5.0|As you know, this is Kate's third album, and it was followed by the masterpieces \\"The Dreaming\\", and \\"Hounds of Love\\". To me, \\"Never Forever\\" sounds like a cross between her debut and the Dreaming, but still is a very rewarding and challenging experience.<br /><br />The album begins with favourite Kate Bush single ever (besides \\"The Dreaming\\"). It is such a strange pop song, but it somehow got to #1 in Australia and top 5 in the UK. The song starts out with a cello, and the verses are rather quiet, and the chorus just explodes with Kate singing 'All yours / Babooshka / Babooshka / Babooshka ya ya' - the video is one of Kate's best also.  The second track is the strange \\"Delius (song of summer)\\". It is one of my least favourites, but this is not to say that it is bad. It is a nice contrast to the out-there-ness of most of the other track and makes a nice chillout song. \\"Blow Away\\" is another great song that Kate wrote for one of her band members. This is a nice and catchy song that would have made a great single. \\"All We Ever Look For\\" is yet another strange song about we should really look for, and about the relationship between a father and son or daughter especially.<br /><br />\\"Egypt\\" is another strange (I am really overusing this word today), and one of my favourite songs EVER! The song sounds so modern - it could be released today or in the future, remembering that this album is 26 years old. The climax in this song is one of the best Kate Bush moments ever (others are the climaxes of Hello Earth and Jig of Life), and I cannot understand how anyone could dislike this song. \\"The Wedding List\\" sounds like a novelty song musically but is much more than that. Kate sings about anger and hurt in a fun way, which I thought was strange... \\"Violin\\" is just an out of control song about who knows what. All I can say is that the vocals are great, the music is great, and this song is very fun and very crazy.<br /><br />\\"The Infant Kiss\\" is a nice ballad, but not one of my favourites, but does feature one of my favourite lines ever: 'There's a man behind those eyes'. \\"Night Scented Stock\\" sets the mood for the album, and its running time is not more than one minute. There are just backing vocals in this song basically. \\"Army Dreamers\\" is a mysterious song and defiantly one of my favourites. It was the third and final single and peaked at #16 in the UK. The song is about war and how bad it is, and tells the story of a man who wanted to be a successful father, but died (in a war) before he was 20. \\"Breathing\\" closes the album, and should leave you in awe. It is another strange song, and I am surprised in peaked so highly in the UK (#16) because it is so different and inaccessible. The song begins with some weird piano chords, and has another great video, and I think the Never Forever/Dreaming was the era when Kate produced her best videos. The song is about a baby inside a mother's womb, breathing in toxins such as nicotine, because of a war.<br /><br />9.5 / 10<br /><br />As you don't know, for me, and album has to be an absolute masterpiece for me to give it a 10, and this album (with tracks such as 2 and 8) just falls short of this. But the album is still great, and ranks around my 4th/5th favourite Kate album at the moment, but her albums ARE VERY hard to rank, because they are all really really good (yes, including Lionheart and The Red Shoes). Kate Bush is my favourite artist/band etc. ever, and this album is one of the main reasons why.of my favourites, but does feature one of my favourite lines ever: 'There's a man behind those eyes'. \\"Night Scented Stock\\" sets the mood for the album, and its running time is not more than one minute.

The song is about a baby inside a mother's womb, breathing in toxins such as nicotine, because of a war. <br /> <br />9.5 / 10 <br /> <br />As you don't know, for me, and album has to be an absolute masterpiece for me to give it a 10, and this album (with tracks such as 2 and 8) just falls short of this. But the album is still great, and ranks around my 4th/5th favourite Kate album at the moment, but her albums ARE VERY hard to rank, because they are all really really good (yes, including Lionheart and The Red Shoes). Kate Bush is my favourite artist/band etc. ever, and this album is one of the main reasons why. <br />
B000E1155E|3.0|Hype Hype Hype.All i get is just 2 great bands-The Strokes & Bloc Party-.This band is ok but not great.Their songs aren't interesting except 3-4.The rest are a worse version of Libertines.I don't understand why they get this promotion...
0790729377|5.0|I can't believe that this film rated less than On The Waterfront per Amazon reviewers!!! In my mind On the Waterfront SUCKED compared to A Streetcar Named Desire.  Oh well... if you want to view a FANTASTIC film get Streetcar Named Desire. On The Waterfont had GREAT talent, no doubt, but it DID NOT deserve the accolades it has gotten. It is maudlin. It is uninspired. It is a cash-in on the then highly popular Marlon Brando. DO NOT read the movie review pundits. Watch and feel. The choice will be obvious.
B00005JO20|3.0|Am I the only person who is wondering HOW THE HECK they got Kong off the Island and back to NY??? It's just a \\"small\\" detail, right? PLEASE! They could have at least shown us how they did it! It would have been a great scene loaded with more tension as they try not to wake him up! I don't think that boat was equipped to handle a 25 ft gorilla. Don't get me wrong - I loved the effects, Naomi Watts was amazing in her scenes with Kong and the last hour was spectacular...but I'd rather Jackson had chopped off 1/2 from the front and shown us how the crew handled transporting him back.
B00005JO20|5.0|`King Kong', the second remake by master fantasy director, Peter Jackson is a major improvement over the first remake (which, however, is not quite as bad as some may have said), but somehow, it does not quite manage to outdo the impact of the original, when you pro-rate the advances in special effects technology against the great impression made by the original.<br /><br />To the good, I must say that unlike so many other movies, the trailer gives just the tip of the iceberg of special effects gee whiz impact. Many scenes which never made it to the trailer are even more impressive than the highlights. Most impressive is the brontosaurus stampede and Kong's fistfight with three T Rexs while swinging from a tangle of vines while simultaneously holding Naomi Watts in his right palm. Even better may be his interpretation of the natives on Skull Island. In the original and in the first remake, the natives seem more like Jackson's recreation of the natives on the Broadway stage than like a true primitive tribe living in the shadow of a collection of bloodthirsty prehistoric monsters. Jackson's version of these feral primitives may be his most creative change to the images created in the original and left largely untouched by the first remake. In fact, all the business between the landing on Skull Island and the contact between Kong and Watts is a major improvement over the first two movies. The set adds a moat between the prehistoric wall and the part of the island where the monsters lived. It also solves the problem of why the natives even bothered to venture into this region beyond the wall even for the short time needed to  place the sacrifice to Kong. It does not, however, solve the problem of what Kong wants with these young female `brides' as he is obviously still a vegetarian.<br /><br />The main question, however, is why the movie did not make a bigger impression in the theatre when it was released late last year, given the enormous prerelease buildup, the cachet of being the remake of one of the most important movie fantasies of all time, and the bump from the 11 Academy Award sweep from `Lord of the Rings, Return of the King' in 2003. There are two easy reasons. First, this is a remake, so most of the credit for the story and most of the images which were invented in the original movie and simply enhanced by Jackson and his crew. Second, this is easily seen as simply a clever action fantasy story, while `Lord of the Rings' involved an epic battle between good and evil, spearheaded not by a crew armed with guns and modern chemicals, but with simple grit and courage. Another possible explanation for its less than expected impact is the fact that the fourth Harry Potter movie and the first installment in Disney's Narnia franchaise came out, which was a truer successor to the `Lord of the Rings' aura than the `King Kong' story.<br /><br />The most common complaint I read about this new `King Kong' is that it was simply too long. I agree with this, adding to it that some of the new scenes on Skull Island, especially those involving some fantastical new creatures and the oversized insects simply do nothing to move the story forward. That the original movie did such a great job of telling its story in about 90 minutes makes one wonder why Jackson couldn't match them scene for scene and be done with it. It is understandable that he wants to be seen as improving on the original, but since he does that in so many demonstrable ways, why draw it out as well.<br /><br />One improvement which works is Naomi Watts' business with Kong on Skull Island and her relation with the big ape in general. This takes some additional time, but not much. Another improvement is the change in Carl Denham's situation before he leaves New York. This change works well with casting Jack Black as Denham. Black fits the scoundrel's role far better than an Indiana Jones hero type actor. While interesting, Jackson's opening miniature feature on the contrast between New York wealth and depression poverty is very well done, but it contributes little to the story. Since we've seen it all before, we don't really need to be reminded of the fact that the story takes place at the height of the depression. I'm almost disappointed Jackson didn't make something of the fact that the Empire State Building was just finished early in the depression years, and the action takes place (maybe) while the building is not even completed.<br /><br />The greatest benefit of the new effects technology, much of it created by Jackson's own effects company for `Lord of the Rings', is the characterization of Kong, done by computer enhancement of a live actor (Andy Serkis, who is best known for being the voice and business behind the Gollum character). This improved one of the few drawbacks of the original primitive effects in that the `claymation' style of animation left its traces on the Kong model fur.<br /><br />While Serkis makes a major improvement in the characterization of Kong, I really had a hard time seeing Watts' performance as an improvement over both Fay Wray AND Jessica Lange, who, at the time of her appearance in King Kong 2, was seen as simply a new dumb blond. I prefer to think that Lange was giving us an excellent performance of a character who was a dumb blond and thereby made a major improvement on Fay Wray's characterization. The improvements in Watts' character are due less to her impromement over Lange or Wray as an actor but in the improved additions to her business by the writers and director.<br /><br />I am really happy that Jackson decided to recreate the original rather than, like the first remake, recast the plot with a different motive for visiting Skull Island. I think he would have done an even better job at cutting back on some of his `improvements' but not on his most basic changes to Denhan's character and motives.<br /><br />This version has few extras, certainly none which substantially improve the experience of viewing the movie.trast between New York wealth and depression poverty is very well done, but it contributes little to the story.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions' is Madonna's clever return to purely dance music.  The crafting of this album is out of this world, Madonna & Stuart Price knew exactly the direction that Confessions' was taking: an excesive display of club music.  This sets Madonna at her best.  The first single \\"Hung Up\\" is a reminiscence of the gloriuos days of organic disco music, borrowing sounds of swedish group \\"Abba\\", this is just a fun dance track with meaningless words but fun & extremely addictive beat.  The second track \\"Get Together\\" is a simple dance track with obvious lyrics (\\"can we get together, I really want to be with you?\\")but continuos dub that enhances the tune.  \\"Sorry\\" the third track also the second single, offers a very post-disco sounds with hard stumps, the high point here is that the lyrics are more poinant and sharp, besides who can resist Madonna's take on saying \\"I'm Sorry\\" in different languages .  \\"Future Lovers\\" this fourth track is my personal favorite, the start beat is just enchanted & reminds me of \\"I Feel Love\\" from \\"Donna Summer\\", and the vocalitation is just magical.  \\"I Love New York\\" is simply fun & beatdelicious, I just have to complaim Madonna's ditching on other cities, specially on L.A., \\"Let It Be\\" a confessional track & dramatic, \\"Forbbiden Love\\" a song that falls in a chillout trance, why did Madonna repeat a title?, \\"forbbiden love: are we supposed to be together\\" \\"forbbiden lover: well I hope so\\" \\"Jump\\" the best music track of all, it takes you back to an early eighties funky beat.  \\"How High\\" has a hard beat and very dramatic lyrics, \\"Isaac\\" Madonna injects a dosis of her new believes and the sound is just mystical, \\"Push\\" here the dance beat slows down, and let a more top mainstream beat take over, \\"Like Or Not\\" it holds realistic lyrics and mature beats. <br /> <br />Confessions on a Dance Floor is pure dance hysteria, a mayhem of delightment, an album you should own, Madonna still surprises masses with original and flawless music delivery. Besides who can resist a red hair?.
B0000024K1|5.0|If there's one rap-album that has created revolutionary conditions, then it has to be this. At the starting point Chuck D and Flavor Flav basically followed in Run-DMC's footsteps (Yo! Bum Rush The Show), but with help from Eric \\"Vietnam\\" Sadler and  the Shocklee-brothers, better known as The Bomb Squad, this record titled It Takes A Nation Of Millions... turned out to be an explosive sophomore record which immediately achieved classic status. <br /> <br />In 1988 political rap dominated, and Public Enemy where the leaders. It Takes A Nation... were their manifest, and Chuck D delivered his message with authority and justice, much on same level as Malcolm X in his time. Songs as \\"Don't Believe the Hype\\", \\"Black Steel in the Hour Of Chaos\\", \\"Rebel Without A Pause\\" and \\"Night Of the Living Baseheads\\" are all classics. In fact I could have mentioned each and every track that deserves the same label. Actually everything was perfect. The sound-picture really showed Chuck D's frustration, and horns and sirens that created a feeling of paranoia. Compared with other producers at the time, the Bomb Squad made more complex beats. They used a lot of samples, and the result got energetic and loud, like we had never heard before.  <br /> <br />Chuck D, Flavor Flav and Terminator X have become hip-hop icons, and PE have blessed us with several great albums. It Takes A Nation Of Millions... clearly stands out though, not just because it was innovative, but `cause it was truly consistent and a compromise less record. Perfectionism might be the word. Let me conclude by saying that this must be one of the most important albums ever, not just hip-hop, but music in generally. Even in a cultural perspective, does Public Enemy have huge importance. Believe that!   <br />
B000ENWKN8|5.0|Like it, love it, or hate it, dispise it.. the Z-Man made a very interesting album, for me its to say the least.  Orginally Rob and a few fellow musicians made 25-30 songs, or rather thought up a lot of concepts.  I believe this was around the time prior to the making of The Devil's Rejects.  After TDR Rob went on tour at Ozzfest, when he got back from Ozzzfest he decided that the 25-30 songs did not fit his current mood.  So with the help of his long time producer, Scott Humphrey and new guitarist John 5 he made 9 tracks that fit his current mood.  They were written and recorded in 2 months.  He did not totally scrap the old songs, he did carry over some beats. <br /> <br />Personally I love this album, I do believe its better than Hellbilly, not by much mind you.  Rob has really matured as an artist.  He has not aquired a new style, he has not sold out, he has simply evolved.  Instead of doing 16 differnt songs with the feeling of Dragula and More Human Than Human, he has brought 11 new songs that sound totally different from one another.  That was a goal for him I read some where.  Sure Foxy Foxy is different, but its creative.  It shows he doesn't have to swear and yell and scream to make a song be something.  But then you have Let It All Bleed Out, probably the heaviest, most cutting edge song he has ever done IMO.  The Scorpion Sleeps is something he has never really done before, its very happy, I love that aspect.  All in all I am very happy with this album.  Its in a way fresh, new, but still bears a lot of his trade marks.  Sure, I was a bit suprised when I first heard this album, I knew this was coming though, but still it caught me off gaurd.  But after a few listens it made more sense in my head as to why he did this.  He does it for the fans and because it makes him happy. <br /> <br />And btw whoever said John 5 was terrible, have you ever heard either of his 2 solo albums?  He is a major shredder.  Steve Vai was a guest on his latest.  Steve Vai doesn't play on someone's album because they are a \\"terrible guitarist\\".
0553801503|3.0|I've enjoyed this series to-date and waited for this latest edition seemingly forever.  It doesn't take Martin long to get you thrown back in to his world of mayhem and intrigue.  A long time passed between my reading of the previous book and this one, so the murder which takes place in the early pages was an unsettling reminder of the brutality of the not unrealistic existence the author has created.<br /><br />The character development continues to be a strength of this series, but that's where I hit my issue with this book.  It seemed to be all character development (700 pages worth) and very little in the way of anything substantial actually happening.  I sincerely hope that part two of this book, featuring the other half of the character base, provides a bit more in that regard.  I really don't like the idea of having to wait until book six, whenever that might come out, before the grand story starts moving once more.
B00005JOFO|5.0|How is it, that the rest of the world can see how beautiful this movie is and you can't? Brokeback Mountain instantly became my favorite movie before I had moved from my seat to leave the theater. The scenery is amazing, Ang Lee creates a masterpiece. I might say the same thing as you and ask what the big deal was, if there had ever been a love story between two cowboys before. Westerns and their cowboys are a huge part of cinematic history, and the epitome of a man. To take that persona and show the story of two who dare to be different, is one of the bigger things that make Brokeback Mountain so great. Second, the acting is not mediocre at most. It's brilliant, and if you had ever seen Heath Ledger or Jake Gyllenhaal act before, you might realize this movie represents incredible breakout performances for both. I think the movie is easy to fall in love with, powerful in the way it's love story unfolds, and an all around inspiring movie.
B0000A0DRY|4.0|As music that once typified the thoughts of a generation, this CD still stands the test of time. Of course, it's still muddy by modern standards, (compare to an equivalent modern CD: \\"City of God\\" by Outgrabe) but it has been made more accessible. The most important thing, in my opinion, is that the music itself still lives and breathes. <br /> <br />\\"White Rabbit\\" still comes through as a journey away from conventionality, although it feels like more a hipster teen drugfest than I once thought. The \\"Bolero\\"-like arrangement retains all its original genius, however. <br /> <br />\\"Today\\" is as sweet as ever, right on the edge of smarm. The slugfests between Marty Balin and the rest of the band must have hilarious/painful to watch, <br /> <br />\\"Somebody to Love\\" is the track the continues to deliver plenty of power. Probably because of its appeal to the universal human emotion: longing.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I must say I've watched this more times than I can count, and so it's safe to say I'm in love with this film. But there are a few details that need to be touched upon if you're considering this film.<br /><br />-Book to Film-<br />For two hours of time, I think this film did a decent job of translating Austen's work into a film format. Because of everything that happens, however, I don't think I would've minded if an additional half-hour had been added. A lot more could've been touched on and explained. \\"What do you mean, explained?\\" See the next section.<br /><br />-Warning to P&P Unfamiliars!-<br />I can watch this film and see why some people who have never read P&P or watched any other film adaptations would be wondering, \\"What's up with Lizzy and Darcy anyway?\\"<br />Truly, you see more of everything else than you do of them, which could lead those unfamiliar with the story to wonder why Elizabeth wanted much to do with Darcy in the end. I don't think that their relationship was developed as much as it needed to be, and it might make people wonder why Lizzy and Darcy ended up in love at all.<br /><br />-Characters and Actors-<br />I was skeptical about Keira Knightley, as she didn't fit my picture of Elizabeth Bennet, but she surprised me and gave Lizzy a wonderfully fiery character that I enjoyed very much. I rather liked Matthew Macfadyen as Mr Darcy, and especially loved the almost boyish aspect he brought to the character--I felt it made Darcy much more realistic and even likeable. Great talent is always needed in the role of Mr Darcy, and Macfadyen definitely has that. The actors do quite well with body language--sharp eyes notice this is a prominent thing in this film, and it indeed speaks volumes.<br /><br />-In Conclusion-<br />I think this is a fresh and unique take on Pride and Prejudice, and being a great fan, I welcomed that. Small details, such as the 'grunge' feel of the Bennet household, made this film more realistic rather than giving me yet another Austen \\"fairy tale perfection\\" film. The music and imagery gave me this near-surreal or -fantastical feel that I especially love. Once again, however, I would warn someone not familiar with Pride and Prejudice to watch this film with someone who is! They'll be better able to acquaint you with the language, social behaviours, and the dynamics of the story itself.<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic and wonderfully novel take on Pride and Prejudice!nd imagery gave me this near-surreal or -fantastical feel that I especially love.

B0002ZXCY4|3.0|Take a mixture of hard rock, pop, metal, folk, blues, prog, add several guest vocalists and musicians, blend well, and you have this double disc jammed with over 100 minutes of music. The concept is interesting and would be a very cool musical. The music, vocals and performances on the first disc are solid and exhilarating but on disc two, it loses power. Originally released in 1998, this 2004 re-issue includes a CD-ROM section on the making of the album.
B000065KH4|5.0|I loved every minute of this! The story was intriguing, the scenes were beautiful and the acting was superb. I actually felt like I was in the movie, which made it that much more special. I could watch this movie every day!
B00008H2LB|4.0|If I were to rate this album based on how \\"metal\\" it is, then it may not deserve a good rating. But, that isn't fair. There are countless artists that are not metal, but are good. So, I'm not sure why reviewers are saying it's not good because it's not metal. This is a good album. My only complaint is that it's too short, but it is good to the last drop.
1400079276|1.0|Too many unanswered questions.  Too many cop-outs.

0141439513|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's masterpiece and it deservedly bears this title.  Pride and Prejudice is the perfect love story.  It starts out with the Bennet family.  Mr. Bennet has five daughters of marriagable age, and a wife who is in a hurry to marry them off.  When rich Mr. Bingley moves to town, bringing his even-richer friend Mr. Darcy with him, Mrs. Bennet plans to have two of her daughters married within a matter of months.  Things don't go quite as planned, though, when Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of the story, meets the prideful Mr. Darcy.  Elizabeth is unlike any other young woman of her time (except perhaps Jane Austen herself).  Elizabeth is smart, sharp-tongued, and stubborn.  When she meets Mr. Darcy she considers him to be the most disagreeable person she has ever met.  But sometimes first impressions (which was fittingly the original title of the book) aren't always right, and the story unfolds from there.<br /><br />  I was reluctant to read this book at first because I was afraid I wouldn't understand the language.  It was a little difficult at first, but the more I read the more I got into the rhythm of the language and the more I understood.  What inspired me to read the book was the new movie version starring Keira Knightley, which I loved.  Watching the movie before I read the book made the book easier to understand.  Not only did I love the story, but I loved the rich characters who brought life to musty, early 19th century England.  Everyone in the story has more to their character than meets the eye, and that made all the characters more realistic.  I also liked how the book was very decent.  It was refreshing to read a book that didn't have any profanity or graphic scenes.  For those who are easily bored, this may not be the book for you because it is rather lengthy and tends to drag in places. This book is probably more enjoyable for girls than for guys, but by no means does that make this novel a Harlequin Romance.  All in all,I was very pleased with Pride and Prejudice, and I am glad I got over my own prejudice of old fashioned language enough to read this gem of a book.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|This is a very good movie worth rewatching. Its probably one of the best movies I've seen from 2005. The acting is nearly flawless, and the story is engaging. I don't even listen to Johnny Cash before but my head was bouncing on almost every musical scene. Some of the scenes are quite intense and very realistic.
B00000K0DV|4.0|It's actually a good movie. Yes, it's unpleasant and sarcastic, but it's meant to be that way. Like a reviewer said, serial killing is not picking daisies. The film is carefully shot. Just watch the different length of the panning shots, the dissolving shots, the way they contribute to the atmosphere of claustrophobia. The music sounds like an early eighties cop show and it's totally adequate. For beginners of Fulci, I'd recommend Lizard in a Woman's Skin, but if you want to watch a violent murder mystery, this is it. <br />Many people mentioned the scene of the nipple and the eyeball. Well, it is grotesque, but I didn't found it that scary. The Donald Duck voice is one of those details that, before seeing the movie, I thought, what a stupid idea, but the execution (excuse the pun) here is everything, and it really works. This detail is more scary, if you ask me. A creepy film by a director who should be more apppreciated. <br />
B000BO0LLS|4.0|Those are the 2 best tracks in the album, and both are unreleased so far... and thats a pity.  <br /> <br />Stay The Night is a very upbeat song, with great lyrics and vocals. This is probably the song in the album that I've listened to the most. Its got a unique character to it that you can either interpret it as a smooth groove pop or classic R&B.  <br /> <br />One and Only is a very original song. It is easily the most artistically crafted song in the album. I've always wondered how Mariah's trademark high notes would blend with and within a rap duet, and this song answered that and more. I know she's done that style before but this pushes that envelope. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, it's a solid album as many have already stated, but those songs are clear signs of Mariah's maturity as an artist and needs to be available on the airwaves. Most of the time, Mariah's most original songs are unreleased to the public, so her music gets stuck on that perception that she's recycling her materials. The songs from this album that she's released so far: Its Like That, We Belong Together, Shake it Off and Don't Forget About Us, are great, radio-friendly tunes, but they really don't sound much different from what Mariah's been doing in the past in my opinion.  <br />
B000003CM8|5.0|The Allmans are one of the best bands of all time, there is no questioning that. So it's only natural that their self-titled debut is one of the best ever. And if you have any doubts, buy the CD and skip to track two, It's Not My Cross to Bear, which is one of the group's most famous tunes yet, interestingly enough, isn't included on all that many compilations. Then hear Trouble No More, a great cover of a blues classic. And speaking of classics, how about the closing track Whipping Post, the ultimate jam track? Duane's guitar and Gregg's organ/vocals send this one soaring through the top! Don't forget the bass intro, either. Another great jam track is Dreams with nice riffs and soloing.<br />There are a couple other cuts here that are good, but don't quite match up to the \\"Big Four\\" of Cross to Bear, Trouble No More, Dreams and Whipping Post. Black Hearted Woman features a strong delivery from Gregg Allman, but the lyrics (\\"Black-hearted woman, can't you see your man dyin'/I can count on both hands all the sleepless nights I've been cryin'\\") are fairly trite and uninspired. The second of these cuts is Every Hungry Woman, again I like it but there's a reason it's obscure. The LP has a great flow to it, especially the way Don't Want You No More becomes It's Not My Cross to Bear.<br />The last thing worth mentioning about this LP is the back cover, featuring the Allmans all standing near a church. Berry (thanks to Old Enough, and Then Some for pointing this out!) is positioned on a balcony slightly above them, with his arms spread out, looking oddly like Jesus. Besides the fact that it would make an awesome t-shirt (If it isn't already), it's eerily prophetic - Did they know that Berry would die in the next three years? I'd recommend this album to all fans of the Blues or Classic Rock.<br />As a little addition, as far as I'm concerned this and the next three LP's (Idlewild South, At Fillmore East and Eat a Peach) are essentials.
B000001GLK|5.0|This recording is A MUST for all Beethoven concerti lovers. You have tha Italian musicality of two performers (Pollini/Abbado) with the perfect sound of a German (THE German) orchestra.<br /><br />These 5 concerti were recorded live in Germany. At times you hear the pianist singing along with his phrasing.

0739309013|4.0|Up until \\"The Chamber\\" I had a signed collection of all of Grisham's books.  After \\"The Chamber\\" I just couldn't stick with him any more, though I tried. <br /> <br />Now comes this little gem, and because it is on audio CD and I can listen to it without spending any time on it, I have \\"read\\" another of John Grisham's novels.  But this one is good. <br /> <br />It is a story teller's book.   The reader has the affectations and accents of the old Southern story tellers -- sounds just like a friend of mine telling half truths mixed with facts.  Grisham has captured the personalities and dialogue.   Together they paint a picture of Anytown, Mississippi, that should have universal appeal because so much that affected Mississippi in the 1970's affected everyone, from desegregation, to anti feminist attitudes, to elections, to Vietnam. <br /> <br />Grisham builds the stories that form this book upon a cynical, humorous look at ourselves through the eyes of a reporter instead of those of a lawyer, politician or criminal. The newspaper \\"prints all of the letters to the editor\\" and hopes to hear from both sides. <br /> <br />So many things in this book are SOOOO small town -- hand delivered letters under the door, people who have \\"family money\\" instead of wealth, and an assortment of characters right out of Faulkner as well as those resembling some from earlier Grisham novels. <br /> <br />I liked it, and was happy to see Grisham do some good story telling.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|I liked Shakira's English debut and well I liked 'La Tortura' so much that (despite the fact Im not fond of Spanish music) I bought it.  I found Oral Fijacion Volume 1 boring and havent listened to it since.<br /><br />I heard about 'Dont bother' and I heard clips of it but never was so pushed into buying it.  Then as our local Sam Goody went out of business I found it for only $10...I decided what the hey it might be fun.<br /><br />To this point Id heard 'Oh its just medicore' and 'Oh its boring'.  People if this is boring...what were you expecting?<br /><br />I was pleasently surprised.  The first track 'How do you do' was a song to 'God' and not exactly in a flattering light.  Asking questions like 'Do you go to the mosque or the synagogue' and 'And if our fates are woven round your finger why are you a troublemaker?'  I loved it.<br /><br />'Dont Bother' was okay but I found it overhyped.  I have nothing against it but if thats how people are judging Oral Fixation volume 2 no wonder its got such bad buzz.<br /><br />Illegal was a bit boring, and a few other songs fell flat but they were outnumbered by the brilliant and thought provoking tracks.  'Animal City' plots on human nature, and frankly 'Timor' is one of her best songs ever.  Lines such as 'If we forget about them dont worry but if we forget about us then hurry!'  That songs is brilliant...I would buy the album for it solely.<br /><br />So overall 'Oral Fixation Volume 2' maybe isnt just thoughtless pop...but it is some good stuff.  Dont believe the critics; this one is picking up (Hips dont lie or not).
B00005UEAR|4.0|Dream Theater is the only band I would call amazing and irritating at the same time.  They have retreated as their career progressed into a swamp of pretention, operatic cheesiness and unneeded extension of song lengths.  None-the-less, they remain an incredibly versatile, virtuosic group of musicians with a knack for creating catchy, melodic and diverse music in the progressive metal niche, maintaining fantastic songcraft.<br /><br />The first disk is something I thoroughly enjoy, a diverse group of solid songs.  Since each track is very different, I'll review them separately.<br /><br />\\"The Glass Prison\\": A moody, 13 minute, flowing metal song with a lot of great riffs, variety and particularly effective and tastefully used melodic sections.  Like most of the songs on the first disk, they keep their soloing in check but do include a lot of instrumental sections that change at just the right times.  This track is supposed to be some sort of epic about alcoholism, but their lyrical skill is very limited and it seems very impersonal, even if all the notes are in their right places.  It ends with the lyricist calling out to God for help, and the idea of the closed door that opened, the shattered glass prison, is artistic if a bit cliche.<br /><br />\\"Blind Faith\\" is my favorite track on here.  I love near everything about it.  A calm musical landscape of a song until the rocking chorus, the lyrics compliment the emotion of the song well.  \\"I've painted my own Mona Lisa\\".<br /><br />\\"Misunderstood\\" is the other masterpiece of the album.  A darker, more theatric piece, it has a brilliant build up climaxing with a tripped out jam with a chord progression that reminds me of a Morbid Angel song, of all things and like Lord Chimp said can also be compared to King Crimson.  GREAT ominous soloing and the way they end the song is the best moment on the album. I love the lyric \\"From a God to God save me\\".<br /><br />\\"Great Debate\\" is like many have said very similar to something from Tool's \\"Aenima\\" album, even in its scientific subject matter.  It's a good study of the situation surrounding stem cell research, and while I'm not convinced that they really care about what they're saying, the futuristic, orange/red, clinical feel of the song comes across perfectly.  The lyrics are passable except for the line \\"..do we turn to white coat heroes?\\".  Do-anything-for-a-rhyme syndrome.<br /><br />\\"Dissapear\\" is a melancholic ballad with some similarities to Radiohead's ballads, think \\"Exit Music (for a film)\\".  The lyrics are totally cliche (\\"tell me the reasons why\\") but the music is well executed.<br /><br />None of these songs suffer from excess, they are the perfect lenghts to serve their purpose.<br /><br />The 42 minute title track (the whole 2nd disk) is where I have most of my problems with this album and it represents most of what's ever been wrong with the band as well.<br /><br />It's a concept song about mental illness, containing several 'case studies'.<br /><br />The overture seems like an aimless waste of space, orchestral music without the orchestra, utterly predictable chord progressions- I could literally sing the song as it played, never having heard it before.  The themes that appear here are all much better executed in their respective movements.  It also is not effective for setting the tone of the song, because of some inexplicable abrupt mood/key changes.<br /><br />\\"About to Crash\\" is like something from the opening scene of a musical, where the whole town is bustling around and all the characters are introduced, exchanging bits of dialogue.  Some uplifting piano and catchy guitar work, great vocal melodies.  Sadly, the lyrics and Labrie's delivery are no more convincing than an average musical... the character sketch is entirely generic and vague- nothing to do with reality, or the attributes that would make a person seem real.  It's even so cliche as to use phrases like 'perfect teenage girl'.<br /><br />\\"War Inside MyHead\\" is the most believable of the case studies, being about a soldier who, having come home, can never really escape, the war now going on only 'inside his head'.  This is a darker metal song, with good keyboard integration.  The line \\"hearing voices from miles away\\" always rings out as interesting.<br /><br />\\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\" really rocks and has some fantastic soloing and instrumental work near the end, but the first half suffers from the worst lyrics and vocal delivery on the album- it's IMPOSSIBLE to take seriously... for me anyway.  For the first verse we have Labrie successfully imitating James Hetfield, sounding almost totally indistinguishable... meaning it's uninteresting... the riffs and drumming during this part almost seem to imitate Metallica as well.  Then it comes to a sort of call and response vocal, with Labrie trying to imitate the voice of a 'doctor' or scientist, and saying things like \\"the boy is simply crazy, we have just the tools to fix him!\\" in a horrible fake accent.  At least it makes me laugh.<br /><br />\\"Goodnight Kiss\\" is a somewhat emotional but totally unoriginal ballad that I none-the-less enjoy, about a mother separated from her child.  Chord progressions are once again predictable.  They REALLY should have left out the phrase \\"mommy's love\\".  Cheesy!<br /><br />\\"Solitary Shell\\" is a catchy but fairly uninteresting light rock song with a lot of strummed clean guitars and lyrics about a cliche isolated boy who was a \\"monday morning lunatic\\" (bad lyric).  This song doesn't totally fit in the scheme of the larger piece, being really its own thing.<br /><br />\\"Losing Time / Grand Finale\\" I have mixed feelings about.  I cringe when I hear the lyric \\"she dressed in black everyday\\", uttered by a smug Labrie who has generalized human psychology beyond belief.  On the other hand, there's a great build-up to the end and finishing the song with a soaring final note that echoes for minutes and the line \\"our illusive mind\\" was a great idea.<br /><br />There's a lot to enjoy about this album, but a lot to dislike as well.  As you can see, most of my problems are with the lyrics and pretention of the band on the second disk.  If you're in for an insincere but effective opera, give this a try.  I don't think it should be priced as a double album, either.  It seems smaller in scope than other albums of such nature, and this was not the band's intent.  I would unhesitantly rate the first disk 5 stars, but with the second included my rating drops somewhat.  Dream Theater are immensly talented songwriters and musicians, but I believe they have better work than this.  I'm giving \\"Awake\\" a try next.can never really escape, the war now going on only 'inside his head'.  This is a darker metal song, with good keyboard integration.

0380973650|4.0|American Gods is equal parts hallucinogenic travelogue, religious homage, science-fiction adventure, and search for the soul of the American Country. Gaiman's novel follows an ex-convict that gets involved with ancient gods, having unwillingly taken the form of bottom-feeding humans, as they prepare for their final battle with the new idols that have usurped them. One's ability to enjoy the book depends greatly on his or her ability to suspend disbelief in the face of such a far-fetched contrivance, however, underneath it lies an intelligent and often compelling narrative that laments the loss spirituality and faith in modern American civilization.<br /><br />(read more reviews like this at<br /><br />[...]
B0009A1AS2|5.0|What's so great about DT is that they are so unpredictable.  They can release anything on any given album at any given time and somehow they still manage to make darn good music.  Many fans felt a little disappointed and disheartened with DT's last album, \\"Train of Thought\\".  However, that is only the exploratory side of them.  So that was their \\"heavy metal\\" album.  So what was next?  Of course, no one could have predicted. <br /> <br />So what is \\"Octavarium\\"?  Well, in short, it's restrained, unpretentious, and more akin to \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" than any of their other albums.  I can already hear the groans coming.  Yet do not fear, DT fans, for this is better than FII (an album I love and feel is criminally underappreciated, by the way).  The musicians of the band do not go wild and reach new plateaus of virtuosos musicianship, but I feel that unlike albums such as 6DOIT and even parts of SFAM, this helps them keep cohesion and structure.  Thus, it's a great album for both DT fans and non-DT fans alike. <br /> <br />\\"The Root of All Evil\\" - 9/10 <br />A strong vocal performance, and though Petrucci doesn't go off like he does on other albums, every member seems to mesh really well on this song. <br />\\"The Answer Lies Within\\" - 6/10 <br />The weakest track on the album, in my opinion, but that might just be me.  I never got into nearly any of their ballads, and this is no exception.  And the lyrics on this one are pretty darn cheesy, too.  (You've got the future on your side/You're gonna be fine now/I know whatever you decide/You are gonna shine).  No thanks. <br />\\"These Walls\\" - 9/10 <br />Another really good song, slow yet hard rocker that has a catchy keyboard part from Jordan.  The lyrics about insecurity have been done many times before by DT, but we all know that lyrical creativity isn't the band's forte. <br />\\"I Walk Beside You\\" - 8.5/10 <br />This song will obviously get a mixed reaction from fans.  Yes, it has a very happy, poppy chorus, complete with generic mainstream lyrics that will make some people want to vomit, but it's a very well-written song.  Just goes to show you that they can even do these kinds of songs and do them well. <br />\\"Panic Attack\\" - 9.5/10 <br />From the lightning-fast, powerful guitar opener to the awesome solo, to singing from LeBrie that reminds me a little of something from Muse, even, it's an all-around good song.  What carries this song from beginning to end is the virtuoso musicianship that is more present here than on all the other songs of the album. <br />\\"Never Enough\\" - 8/10 <br />Not quite as strong as all the other songs on this album, though not bad by any stretch of the imagination.  During the verses, LeBrie really sounds like the lead singer of Muse (am I crazy or what?).  It has some pretty good soloing, but what brings this song down a notch are the lyrics. <br />\\"Sacrificed Sons\\" - 8.5/10 <br />A lot of people seem to really love this song, but I only find it to be a little above average.   The haunting, slow, singing by LeBrie on this song doesn't interest me nearly as much as the other songs.  Yeah, it's got some inspirational, thought-provoking lyrics about 9/11, but a lot of people will think this song to be a little late in coming.  It has, after all, been 3 1/2 years, and writing a song about it this long afterward seems a little strange. <br />\\"Octavarium\\" - 10000/10 <br />Here it is.  The crown jewel.  In my opinion, this is the GREATEST song that DT has released to date.  This is the perfect example of cohesion between the musicians without having to be overly technical.  This 24-minute epic has possibly the best progression that I've ever heard.  It starts with a gentle, ambient section by Jordan (which, by the way, is pretty cool to see him play live) that perhaps goes on for a little too long.  It follows up with a soft acoustic and vocal part before the song begins to pick up.  John Myung plays a catchy bass riff in the next section, and LeBrie gives agreat peformance.  After this, the musicians go to town.  The song begins to give off the impression of falling into insanity, especially with Lebrie's frantic performance on the next two sections and downright strange, even evil, lyrics.  The song hits its climax as James screams \\"TRAPPED INSIDE THIS OCTAVARIUM\\" with more power than I've heard since \\"Awake\\", before culminating with a moving orchestral part, leaving us with the same piano key that kicked off the album. <br /> <br />All in all, it's not their best album overall, but it does have what I think is their best song, though I'll likely be in the minority there.  If you're a DT fan, you'll obviously want this, but don't go expecting instrument-playing along the lines of Liquid Tension Experiment or anything.  Just expect another outstanding DT album with great songwriting and some of the best stuff since \\"Scenes from a Memory\\". <br /> <br />5 Stars.
B00004XQP4|5.0|To the morons below me.....Your opinion about Green Day is not required. The bands that you hate are really good and the bands you like SUCK! I mean Pink Floyd, Rush, Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Beatles, & The Rolling Stones SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Enough of this saying GREENDAYSUCKS...that's not a review so grow up. <br /> <br />This CD is really great. It contains the song that rocks really hard and is one of the greatest songs in rock history and one that everyone must listen to...the title track. My other favorite one is Minority it has great guitar. The last track is good too. Highly recommended along with American Idiot and please <br />don't listen to these JERKS BELOW ME WHO LIKE STUPID BANDS LIKE PINK FLOYD!!!!!!!!
B0000DIJO2|4.0|Although I totally agree with most of the previous favorable reviews, I was so disappointed that the Bee Gees chose to sing only a very short version of perhaps the best song from their Main Course LP, \\"Nights on Broadway\\". Sound tracks are excellent but 4:3 aspect ratio is a bummer and detracts from overall impact. Other than the one-minute version of \\"Nights..\\", this was well worth the purchase.
B000003TA4|3.0|This album is really noisy and overrated. The 4 good songs on the CD would be Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are, & Lithium. The rest of the CD is overrated, lousy, and noisy. They really don't make any guitar solos thus my mom loves this band. They're pretty good. I still recommend this album because Teen Spirit is one of my favourite songs of all time, and this came out when I was BORN! BUY IT...and just listen to those 4.
0440237688|3.0|In this story there are 10 characters Jonas, The Giver, Jonas mother, Jonas father, Lily, Gabriel, Asher, Fiona, Larissa, and The Chief Elder.  The Giver is a futuristic story of a boy named Jonas who's world is perfect.  In his life there is no fear, no war, no pain, no feeling, no hunger, nothing.  Everything is made to be exactly the same.  Everything is done according to the community leaders.  Everybody in the community is given their job when they turn twelve.  Jonas turns twelve and is chosen to become the receiver of memory.  As he trains with The Giver, he finds out that the community he lives in is not fair. Everyone is not being able to feel the good things in life but the good side of it is they can't feel the bad things in life either.  The people who don't live to the rules of the community are \\"released\\".  Jonas finds out that this release process is like death.  He decides that it is his job to return what he has been taken from the community and its people.  With the help of The Giver, Jonas exscapes from the community which will result in the release of all memories to the community.  The memory release shows the members of the community the unfelt feelings of pain, famine, war, as well as human differences, love, and happiness from before.  This book reminds me of a movie that I saw called \\"Equilibrium\\".  It's almost exactly the same but they take some kind of drug to keep them so they don't feel any emotion because they believe that human emotion causes wars.  So if they don't take this drug they are killed. It is almost the same except there's alot of fighting scenes.  That's why I like this book.
B000001EL3|5.0|From the get go the big difference is the production. Thanks to the added magic of a proper producer in Bob Ezrin KISS finally evolved into a mythical beast  rather than the raw beast they were up to this point. Money in the pocket I guess frees up artistic licence. Despite the foray into uncharted waters they swam back to shore quickly after this (despite the success) and cranked up again for subsequent releases. Shame really cause they really do have more to say musically than often they end up saying (apart from a few rare exceptions). Other than the orchestrations and effects, the major change is the lyrical content, being more around the trappings of fame and their kabuki characters being explored rather than sexual gratification. The evolution of KISS can really be heard in the cinematic \\"Detroit Rock City\\" and co headliner \\"King of The Night time World\\", \\"God of Thunder\\" in its eeriness and backwards masking and the gloriously vain \\"Do You Love Me\\" complete with chiming tubular bells and trash can drums. Nine tracks in all. All classics in KISS terms.
B00000ILGX|4.0|I'll be honest. I didn't need this.  I have all Wham! albums, but I had to have this becuase I had to have all Wham! albums.   <br /> <br />This curiously titled \\"The Best of Wham!\\" contains many singles and non-single tracks from \\"Make It Big.\\"  Plus, the remix of \\"I'm Your Man\\" and \\"Everything She Wants.\\" <br /> <br />The remix is not as good as original though I enjoyed the different twists to the tracks. <br /> <br />\\"Careless Whisper\\" is not included in this collection because it was released as George Michael's solo single in the UK. <br /> <br />Including two non-single tracks from \\"Make It Big,\\" \\"If You Were There\\" and \\"Like A Baby\\" was a good choice. <br /> <br />A single \\"Bad Boys\\" were not included in this collection and I was ok with it. <br /> <br />But, \\"The Final\\" which was never released in the US, but available as imports, is absolutely the BEST.  If you don't have to have Wham!'s all albums, skip this, and buy \\"The Final.\\"
B00005JO20|1.0|I almost passed on renting this and just bought it.  I like Peter Jacksons films.  Loved LOTR.  But this is garbage.  The CG looks good by itself, but when live and CG is mixed, looks HORRIBLE!!!  Jurassic Park one looked A LOT better.  The fight scene with the T Rex and Kong was just too unbelieveable.  T Rex fully biting into Kong and no damage whatsoever?!?!?!  Come on.  Sure am glad I just rented it.  I totally agree with all the other one star reviews.  Rent it don't buy it.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Reading the press done by System of a down prior to the release of this album I couldn't help but be reminded of the way that Roger Waters slowly started to seize control of Pink Floyd in the 70's, first by writing all the lyrics, then gradually singing more and more, until eventually he was singing and writing everything himself, leaving the others as mere session musicians. All that happened over the space of about 6 years; here the coup appears to have been much quicker. <br /> <br />Guitarist Daron Malakian has now taken on the additional duties of being the principal vocalist, the main songwriter, the main lyricist, co-producer, and most shockingly the bassist too. Apparently Shavo Odadjian only plays bass on 2 tracks on this double album set, but doesn't mind because he gets to direct the videos. He should enjoy that whilst he can, because no doubt Malakian will want to do that as well next time! And the drummer shouldn't get too comfy on his stool either! The man is clearly a megalomaniac, and like all good megalomaniacs throughout the ages, he is partial to a bit of nepotism, employing his father to do all the artwork for both albums. <br /> <br />All that aside, the album is actually quite good. The most noticeable difference between this and their other albums is Malakian's voice. This is not good news I'm afraid - his voice is very whiny and nasal, and starts to grate after a while. Serj Tankian has one of the most powerful and unique voices in rock music today, but Malakian said that he thought his voice suited the songs better, and he appears to be the one wearing the trousers here. <br /> <br />Other than that it is pretty much business as usual. It starts with an acoustic intro and then runs through 8 fairly standard SOAD songs, some better than others, all fairly short, aggressive in a controlled way, tuneful, and sounding slightly more commercial than previous efforts. Then there is a bizarre song called `Old school Hollywood' which is a complete departure for them, incorporating strange electronic noises and featuring guest vocals by what sounds like someone who has had their vocal chords removed and now speaks with the aid of an electronic voicebox. This is the only way I can describe it, and yet I actually don't mind it, although it definitely won't be to everyone's taste. The album then finishes with a straightforward ballad, which again is new territory for them. <br /> <br />With 11 songs in a mere 36 minutes the album certainly doesn't outstay its welcome, and it begs the question, why weren't the 2 albums released together? The official explanation is that \\"some songs would have been neglected if they had all been released at the same time. There was a 6 month gap to allow the listener to appreciate the songs and get used to them\\". If you believe this then you need your head examining. The total running time of the 2 albums together is 75:57, which would fit comfortably onto a CD, and if they thought that 23 songs on one album was too much then they could have easily culled a few songs. If they had trimmed this down to about 15 songs on one disc then I think they could have had one excellent 5 star album, instead of two good 4 star albums. But then Daron Malakian would only have earned half as much money.......
0671027387|2.0|I enjoyed reading Dan Brown's other novels--Da Vinci Code, Digital Fortress, Angels and Demons. He may be a hack writer, but he's an entertaining hack writer. With his other tomes I could usually suspend disbelief often enough to reach the end of his story without gagging, despite some pretty wild indulgences of his imagination.<br /><br />I have but one inviolable rule when reading fun trash like this: the writer must maintain a thin thread of credibility when it comes to the main plot points. Minor technical transgressions are OK, like space ships that make sound as they fly through space or the bad guy's bomb with a nice big digital clock display. Dramatic gimmicks such as these are easily overlooked because the premise of the story doesn't depend on them.<br /><br />Alas, \\"Deception Point\\" broke that rule on page 100, when Mr. Brown revealed that the story hinged on NASA's apparent discovery of a meteorite containing the fossil remains of extraterrestrial life. He has a bunch of the world's top scientists and the President of the United States all amazed and star-struck over this find. Unfortunately, Dan Brown obviously neglected to consult any paleontologists prior to writing his opus. You see, the type of rock the meteorite in question was composed of cannot support the creation of fossils. It was made of igneous rock--essentially, rock formed from cooled molten lava.<br /><br />Fossils only occur in sedimentary rock and, on rare occasions, metamorphic rock derived from sedimentary rock. Any fossilized extraterrestrial organic life-form could likewise only appear in those types of rock, and never in the igneous rock of Mr. Brown's meteorite.<br /><br />Fossils are formed when an organism dies in a wet, muddy environment and becomes encased in sediment. Over the course of millions of years, the sediment hardens into rock, the organic compounds that made up the carcass leech away and are replaced by silicates. The fossil we see is essentially a casting of the organism composed of rock. However, molten lava would immediately vaporize any critter on contact, making the creation of a fossil impossible. Only an improbable organism based on a material impervious to volcanic heat, like tungsten, could survive such an encounter intact. But these weren't fossils of tungsten-based life forms in Brown's book, they were organic.<br /><br />For me, that was a stupid, careless blunder which ended the story right then and there. I saw no reason to continue reading it. Fortunately, a friend had loaned me the book so I didn't feel like an idiot for wasting my money on it.er, molten lava would immediately vaporize any critter on contact, making the creation of a fossil impossible.

B000E97Y6K|4.0|This new KK is fun and mostly exciting.  But it really is too long (because everyone already knows the story) and the entire movie belongs to Naomi Watts and Kong.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with that--as soon as I heard they had Naomi Watts I knew this movie would be a cut above.  But over the course of 3 hours there should be some other memorable characters and there aren't.  Jack Black and the others are ok but anybody could have been substituted and it wouldn't have made any difference.<br /><br />That's why, when its over, everybody remembers the Anne, Kong and the special effects.  The rest is pretty much filler.  My guess is, its Peter Jackson's ego and he has to embellish everything from the original, just to show that more is better.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|I am very impressed with Peter Jackson's remake of KING KONG.  He captured the correct essence of the characters while remaining true and capturing the essence of the old 1933 classic.  With stunning visual effects and cinematography; I find this film a natural beauty.<br /><br />Skull island a place where the 'flop-film maker' and his crew travel to shoot a motion picture turns out to be a place of horror;<br /><br />Great cast includes:<br /><br />Andy Serkis who did KING KONG's bodily movement thru motion capture and also plays Lumpy the cook.<br /><br />Naomi Watts and Adrian Brody who do outstanding work, and Jack Black who plays the 'eccentric director' is very humorous as he is obsessed with shooting his film so that he will just about risk anything to get a good shot.<br /><br />Others (I'm not sure of the actors names) include the 'vain actor', Jimmy the kid that works on the ship (as seen in Billy Eliot), and the natives are just fantastic...<br /><br />It's a great movie with a great cast and screen play;<br /><br />I don't want to give any spoilers away for those who haven't seen the movie; however I must warn that it is a very LONG movie- but definitely worth your time.
0393061310|5.0|Diamond really does a good job at presenting his ideas clearly in such a way that the layman can appreciate them. I can read and understand anthropological and archaeological mumbojumbo pretty well but its nice to be able to read something in non-technical terms that has not watered down the science. <br />A few people seem to have had problems with this book because they think it is biased in some way. I think one reviewer called it 'PC' because it failed to account for cultural difference as a mechanism, therefore it's 'liberal' and 'PC'. The thing is that these reviewers aren't seeing the underlying assumption behind the thesis of the book. Diamond is taking an environmental view of culture, basically saying that culture is a non-biological adaptation that forms in response to environmental pressure. So, yes, culture has something to do with the spread of Eurasians around the globe, what he is arguing is that the root of the culture and it's spread stems from the environments that they developed in. I'm not sure why or how that is liberal. He's pretty non-judgemental about the entire process.
B000035P7X|5.0|This DVD was a fascinating view into the life of the greatest song and dance man of all time. The music video of Subterranean Homesick Blues is humorously primitive, but none the less, captivating and enthralling. After watching this movie I will never throw glass out of a window or wear a Dylan shirt to a Donovan concert again. If you like Bob you will love this DVD. It is a true necessity to any self-proclaimed Dylan fan. It's worth the money to see Bob and his manager make fun of Donovan. The tension is hysterical. I also recommend to any Dylan followers to buy his book \\"chronicles pt1\\". It's so well written I began to wonder if Bob missed his calling with that one. But then I remembered he released at least 10 albums worth seriously leaving your seat right now and buying, but none the less he is also an excellent writer. As for any Folk fans out there I also recommend buying The Newport Folk Festival DVD. Artists including but not limited to Bob Dylan, Donovan, Joan Baez, Odetta, Buffy Sainte Marie, Johnny Cash, Peter Paul and Mary and many more are shown performing at this infamous gathering. This, including comments and footage of the crowds, builds a feeling of unity that has quickly diminished in this overly unappreciative world. Buy it and you'll long to be there, I guarantee it.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|Finally, a release date for the superb follow up to the first Underworld.  I am really looking forward to owning this DVD, I only hope it includes many great extras like the special 2-disc special edition of Underworld.  Underworld Evolution picks up right where Underworld left off with Selene (played by the amazingly talented and beautiful Kate Beckinsale) and Michael fresh off the slaying of Viktor.  The storyline is wonderfully written and the transition from the first Underworld to Evolution is seamless (it's like one long movie).  I don't want to give anything away (and I probably wouldn't be as I'm sure most people reading this have already seen Evolution) so I won't go too much into the story.  Let's just say the 3rd and only remaining elder, Marcus, is awakened and there are issues between him and Selene.  I will finish by saying that the original concept for this story was a trilogy with part III perhaps being a prequel.  A prequel makes the most sense because you can bring back all the characters introduced in the first 2 including Viktor, Amelia, Kraven, Marcus, Lucian, Raze, et al.  Again, I'm really looking forward to buying this DVD!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Only time will tell if Sufjan Stevens manages to churn out enough albums for all fifty states. Since 2003, he's covered only two of the states. Maybe he can combine some state names...<br /><br />But whether or not he covers the whole USA, Stevens' will keep charming people with his music, as he does in his latest album \\"Illinoise.\\" And no, that is not a typo. It's sort of folk -- dreamy acoustic pop, with songs about aliens, God, and wacky interludes. This is folk music for the Wes Anderson fans.<br /><br />It opens with a dreamy intro about a UFO, written in elusive language that could hint at either aliens or a religious vision. Your pick which it is, but Stevens' sweet voice and birdlike instruments make it sound ethereal... before it switches over into the choral singing and inspiring horns of \\"Black Hawk War.\\" By the time it's over, you'll feel like saluting.<br /><br />Stevens uses that as a springboard for lighter material -- inspiring rock anthems, mellow acoustic music, and vaguely ominous balladry. Some of the songs wouldn't be out of place at a down-home barn dance, and others are sparkling indie bliss. And yes, some songs dabble at both styles, like the sweeping dancey \\"Man of Metropolis.\\"<br /><br />By the last stretch of the album, Stevens switches over to a folk-dreampop style, with cute little interludes between the songs. \\"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!!\\" wins for most unique title, but it also shows Stevens off in his eerie folk best. It's a sound that continues its melancholy way, right to the end -- the sparkling \\"Out of Egypt.\\"<br /><br />Yep, \\"Illinoise\\" is one of those albums that qualifies as an experience -- it's the sort of music that transports you away, and doesn't set you back down until it ends. Though it borders on maudlin in places, Stevens' songcraft and musical skill are enough to make every song on this album a treasure.<br /><br />Stevens has your basic folk voice, but he uses it with such sweetness and smoothness that he sounds amazing. Sometimes he just sings as is, and sometimes he lets the chorus of backing vocals swell up behind him, singing harmony to every line. And then there's the music, which adds further harmony to his vocals. Ah yes, the music. It's a colourful patchwork of basic folk -- acoustic guitar, drums, bells, horns, piano and what sounds like a xylophone. It's bright in some places, dismal in others.<br /><br />And it's full of Stevens' bittersweet lyrics, where he manages to make us pity a serial killer, mourn a city's passing, and wonder what those lights in the sky are. He has a definite way with words (\\"i can't explain the state that I'm in/the state of my heart... he was my best friend\\"). And though Stevens often plays coy about the spiritual undertones of his songs, the passion in them is undeniable (\\"In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel....\\").<br /><br />It's going to be hard to top the eerie folk of \\"Illinoise,\\" but Sufjan Stevens will undoubtedly do it. Whatever state he chooses next. Bittersweet and beautiful.s is, and sometimes he lets the chorus of backing vocals swell up behind him, singing harmony to every line.

1400079179|4.0|I personally liked the book.  I will definitely read it again.  The book grabs you from the beginning and won't let you go until you finish.  The characters are well written and the storyline is fast and interesting.  His historical data and location descriptions will make you want to go and visit the sites yourself.  If I can, I would have given this book 4.5 stars.  5 Star is reserved for his other book \\"Angels & Demons\\".  I liked that book better than this one.  Hope this Helped!!!
0375758992|3.0|I enjoyed the writing style of this book, but found it overall depressing.  There were a few bits that were funny/ touching. I probably wouldn't reccomend it to a friend.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|For anyone who hasn't seen this masterpiece of a movie called Underworld: Evolution, you should make an obligation to do so. I have a hard time admitting it, but I have to. This second movie, if only a little bit, is better than the first, which, judging by some of the more recent vampire/werewolf movies I've seen that came after the first Underworld, is an impossible task. For the second time in a row, the story,although a continuance, is masterfully done, being one of the deepest and most immersive in movie history, and linking up with the first movie  in perfect succession. Now, frankly, I don't want to reveal any of the story, for those few people who haven't seen this. However, I will say this: you finally get to see the third, and also oldest and strongest of the three vampire Elders, Marcus, in the flesh. Tony Curran plays the role of Marcus, and I've got to say, there's not a single actor who could've done it better. The action is again perfect in this installment. Just as perfect, if not better, than in the first.  I also have to comment that Kate Beckinsale looks sexier and better than ever in this movie, reprising her role as Selene flawlessly. Scott Speedman is also great in reprising his role as the vampire/werewolf hybrid, Michael Corvin. So, overall, if you want to see a masterpiece vampire/werewolf movie, BUY THIS DVD. It's not even that long of a wait before it's released, either. I hope I've helped  those of you who're curious whether to buy this movie or not, and I hope you all do yourselves a favor, and do in fact buy it. It could very well be your favorite movie,  it's definitely mine in this particular genre. Enjoy!!!
B00001OH82|5.0|One life is not enough for Bowie, he have been David he have been Bowie, he have been Ziggy Stardust he have been Tin Machine Front man, he kills himself and then he resurects himself actually he did that twice once in the 70s when he decided to end Bowies career and started as Ziggy and the Spiders but before 80s started he came back as Bowie and in late 80s he announced \\"Bowie is dead, long live Tin Machine\\" and a couple of releases, gooooood releases came being the self tittled \\"Tin Machine\\" a pleasant surprise blues, rock, hard and that elegant element that Bowie always add to his music, his  constantly renovated music , because \\"the Chamaleon\\" seems to never run out of ideas its really amazing, with Tin Machine Bowie once again allowed himself to be a front man in a band instead of being David Bowie with capital letters all the time, and thats refreshing for a change and Bowie can afford that, not everybody can. <br />HM
B00005JO20|4.0|Award-winning director Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) gives new life to the 1933 classic with the stunning big-budget remake \\"King Kong\\". In the 1930s, ambitious filmmaker Carl Denham (Jack Black) persuades his new leading actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) on an unsuspected film expedition to the mysterious Skull Island inhabited by prehistoric creatures. The expedition discovers a 25-foot gorilla that falls for the beautiful actress. \\"King Kong\\" is an outstanding visually dazzling thrill ride. The 188-minute remake remains quite faithful to the original film. The story feels over the top but certainly engrossing. The 2005 adventure film truly grabs the audience with its heart-pounding action sequences, good performances, elaborate backgrounds and sensational special effects. The 2005 remake also stars Colin Hanks, Andy Serkis, Thomas Kretschmann and Academy Award winner Adrien Brody. \\"King Kong\\" received overwhelming positive reviews from US critics, grossed over $550 million worldwide and won three Academy Awards (Visual Effects, Sound Mixing and Sound Editing).<br /><br />If you really enjoyed this action-packed remake of the 1933 fantasy classic in theaters, then check out \\"King Kong\\" on DVD. The three-hour blockbuster is presented in its theatrical 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a splendid video transfer with bright colors and terrific resolution. Its 5.1 Dolby Digital sound offers a fantastic listening experience. The DVD menus are quite excellent. If you're looking for extras then I strongly suggest purchasing the 2-Disc Special Edition over this simple release. Overall, \\"King Kong\\" (2005) gets a \\"B\\".
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a very long miniseries that is best when seen all together in one sitting.  This can be difficult, but the end makes your time worth it.  This is a funny and romantic movie that is true to Jane Austin's original work.
B000AARKOO|5.0|It's incredible that an amazing film like Kingdom of Heaven couldn't have the acceptance (at the box-office) that really deserved. A well-balanced mixture of many real facts and some fiction, the story depicts the adventures of Balian of Ibelin (Orlando Bloom), a real christian knight (born not in France but in the Middle-East) son of Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson)during the 12th century. Supporter of Baldwin IV (Edward Norton) the dying King of Jerusalem, Balian has to deal with the (many) factions of knights (templars, hospitallers) whose greed endangers the Kingdom, like the real characters of Guy of Lusignan (Marton Csokas) and Raynald of Chatillon (Brendan Gleeson). After the disaster of the Battle of Hattin (where most of the christian army was annihilated), Balian was one of the leaders of the Jerusalem's defense against the powerful forces of Saladin (performed by Ghasson Massoud). After an heroic resistance, Balian warned that \\"the defenders would rather kill each other and destroy the city than see it taken by force\\". Finally, Saladin allowed for an orderly march (of most of the inhabitans) away from Jerusalem (the history says they had to pay a ransom), preventing a massacre. The film ends here, at the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 and unfortunately doesn't tell the rest of the interesting Balian's life. Kingdom of Heaven could have some mistakes (what if?), but it has all the elements of a great epic movie: lot of action, excellent acting and a good adaptation of the real history, including the politics and intrigues during the Crusades. A must see!
B000002WU9|5.0|It's summer 1995, you walk down the street you hear someone blasting \\"Criminology\\" on their system, you turn on Hot 97 and hear \\"Incarcerated Scarfaces,\\" you turn on the tv and you see the \\"Ice Cream\\" video on the BOX.  Raekwon & The Wu dominated 1995.  Cuban Linx was released that summer and it changed the face of hip-hop forever.  Rae and his side-kick Ghostface were the first to portray the crystal popping gambino character, which Nas and other rappers emulated the following years.  RZA, with his RAZOR SHARP production, was at the apex of his producer career.  It's 2006 and I don't even check the radio or Tv anymore for some good hip-hop because it isn't there.  However, the good news is that Cuban LINX II will be dropping summer 2006.  The album will be mostly produced by the RZA. Hopefully this summer, it will be \\"Deja vu all over again.\\" <br /> <br />Top 5: <br /> <br />1) Incarcerated Scarfaces - Greatest intro ever.  Raekwon's street rhymes and RZA's extremely sharp production makes this a hip-hop classic.  <br /> <br />2) Criminology - Ghost and Rae on some Tommy Hill Fly s***t with a knot.  Insane sampling by the RZA. <br /> <br />3) Heaven & Hell - Extremely smooth and laid back joint.  This was actually released in 1994.  Rae and Ghost spit back to back on this joint finishing each others lines.  Classic.  Sick video also. <br /> <br />4) Ice Water - Introducing Cappadonna....Cappadonna's first appearance as a wu member/affiliate, and he stole show.  This song is the definition of hardcore boom-bap NYC rap.  RZA provides an ill production with a haunting vocal. <br /> <br />5) North Star Jewels - Rae's spits a short but sweet verse over a barry white loops. I wish if this was a full song.
B0000024W3|4.0|The top review here at amazon.com says this album is, \\"At Best, pleasant\\".  I would say that this album is at its very LEAST pleasant--or perhaps too unexpected and thus irritating--and at its very most a challenging listen, a great cross-section of the influences of a seasoned and highly influential musician coming off of his much lauded crest, and a hidden jewel in the Dylan collection.  I only recently discovered this album after hearing just about everything from '61 to '69, (the self-titled first to Nashville Skyline,) and a few great ones from the 70's such as the breathtaking Blood on the Tracks, and Vol. 5 of the Bootleg Series: 1975's Rolling Thunder Review live recordings. <br />Reading Dylan's autobiography, Chronicles, Vol. 1, has helped me to better understand Self-Portrait: this more bucolic and reflective album, as a continuation of the retreat he started with his first post-cycle accident release, John Wesley Harding, (an introspective and highly allegorical album of folk on the cusp of country,) which was followed by the full-on, gentle and relaxed country of Nashville Skyline.  After performing with his idol, Johnny Cash on that latter album's opening track, Girl From the North Country--a song first captured on his second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan--I suppose Dylan thought it would be interesting to look back on his other influences and some revisions from his own repertoire, which is captured well here on an album originally released on double-vinyl.  Some stand-out tracks for me are number one: All the Tired Horses, which is a beautifully-orchestrated chant that he doesn't even sing on; number three: I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know, a gorgeous croon re-introducing that smooth country voice he found on Nashville Skyline; number four: Days Of 49, a rough-and-ready hobo gang ballad; number five: Early Mornin' Rain, another casual croon that nicely compliments his more desperate and anaesthetized song Just Like A Woman from Blonde On Blonde; number eleven: Living The Blues, which may be considered THE standout track on this album, perfectly bridges the gap between his early and late career.  With 24 tracks on one compact disc, this list could go on and on.   <br />In summary, Self-Portrait is an album probably best left to more mature and less fickle Dylan fans, but should certainly not be limited to their ears alone.
0671027387|3.0|With no exception, Dan Brown has once again spoilt a good plot. As the book gets nearer to the 'climax', boredom sets in. Any reader who has read atelast one of his books can predict with pin point accuracy who was the mastermind behind the deception. I was sure of who the culprit was after reading 5 pages or so, hoping against hope this would not be so predictable. The books starts well but we could do without the banal 'romance' and other cliches that were put in it for the inevitable book-to-movie blockbuster.<br /><br />But still, its fun to read the book. You can easily skip some pages that will surely bore you and just read the good part without missing a beat.
B00004XQP4|1.0|Green Day is one of the worst bands of recent times and are as bad as similar groups like N'SYNC,BACKSTREET BOYS and WESTLIFE.THEY ARE A TEEN POP BAND AND SUCK!!!!!!!!.Warning is as bad as American Idiot,so take my advice and stay away from this awful album as well as all the other albums from GREEN DAY.Get albums from great bands like THE WHO,LED ZEPPELIN,BLACK SABBATH,DEEP PURPLE,PINK FLOYD,RUSH,ROLLING STONES,AC/DC and THE BEATLES instead.
B000AYELVU|4.0|After a successful debut, the X-Men are back with this sequel, where they have to face the threat of Colonel William Stryker, who wants to destroy all the mutants. There are new characters like Nightcrawler, Pyro and Yuriko Oyama. The X-Men saga could be endless (like any story based in comics) so I hope there will be nwe and better ideas for the future. One of the strenghts of X-Men 2 is again the multi-star cast: Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn, Alan Cumming. If the producers want to keep the success of the X-Men, they will have to keep the whole cast for a long time!
B00005JNX0|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun - a real high-energy show <br />with lots of pratfalls and slapstick and silly gags that <br />couldn't possibly fail to entertain a kid - or offend <br />one either (only adults who spend WAY too much time <br />being offended).  Though there was one scene where poor <br />Alex the lion had to endure an excessive crotch-shot <br />from a particularly nasty old lady (as a masculinist point, <br />for once in a movie I would like to see a male character <br />kneeing a female character in the groin). <br /> <br />    Overall the movie was very easy and fun to watch, <br />grading very high with the kid in our house, which is <br />the point, after all, of a kid's movie.  Adults who <br />are bored with this sort of stuff should probably stick <br />to bars, strip joints, and other standardized forms of  <br />adult entertainment for the easily bored.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Every new television season, the broadcast networks attempt to overwhelm viewers with a hurricane of hype for their new shows, doing whatever they can to keep more people from jumping over to edgier cable fare.  The result?  All sound and fury, often signifying nothing.  In more recent years, however, network TV has brought the meat, replacing the usual reality show claptrap with smart, well-written dramas and comedies.  What's unfortunate is that some of the best of these shows have gone quietly into the sunset-- cancelled from lack of ratings.  The most recent and notable example would be Arrested Development.  This was almost the fate for perhaps the best and most unheralded show on TV right now-- Veronica Mars. <br /> <br />Luckily, however, UPN realized that it had a special show on its hands, and renewed Mars for a second season. <br /> <br />Much like Buffy the Vampire Slayer before it, Veronica Mars is a show that would likely blow everyone away if it wasn't buried on a smaller network.  The brain behind Buffy himself, Joss Whedon, perhaps describes the show best:  <br /> <br />\\"On the surface, Veronica Mars is a simple Nancy Drew update: High School Girl Solves Mysteries. It's impressive how well it works as just that, because week to week, nothing is harder to pull off than a genuine whodunit, and no show does it better than VM.\\" <br /> <br />He speaks the truth.  Mars brings everything a viewer can ask for: great writing, engrossing stories, a talented cast, complex character relationships, and, above all, a rewarding experience. <br /> <br />In the first season, Veronica is a high school junior who has had her life ripped out from under her.  In the first episode, we learn that her best friend, Lilly Kane, was murdered the previous year.  Veronica had always enjoyed a priveleged position in her hometown of Neptune-- even though she was not wealthy like most of her friends in the popular crowd, the fact that her father, Keith Mars, was the sheriff, afforded her access to the perks of high society.  This, unfortunately, also proved her downfall.  Keith's investigation into Lilly's murder culminated with the accusation of the girl's widely-beloved father as the culprit.  The resulting fallout was devestating to Veronica's life-- Keith lost his job, Veronica's boyfriend and Lilly's brother, Duncan, broke up with her, and, worst of all, Veronica's mother abruptly disappeared from Neptune.  Top all of this off with the fact that Veronica was later drugged and sexually assaulted at a rich-kid party, and you get the feeling that life could not be worse for Ms. Mars. <br /> <br />Luckily, she handles all the adversity with aplomb.  Now a social outcast, Veronica turns her focus to solving the mysterious circumstances surrounding her friend's death, with a little help from her now-private-investigator father and Neptune newcomer/only friend Wallace Fennel. <br /> <br />The strength of Mars (if you could name just one) is the exceptional talent of both Kristen Bell as Veronica and Enrico Colantoni as Keith, as well as the relationship they share.  As the only two left in Neptune that really believe that the truth is still out there, they only have one another to rely on.  As luck would have it, that's all they need. <br /> <br />But they aren't the only ones in Neptune worth watching.  Percy Daggs III as the aforementioned Wallace brings compassion, understanding, and a bit of comic relief in all the right places.  Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls-- Lilly's grieving boyfriend/Duncan's best friend/Veronica's initial antagonist (I told you the character relationships were complicated, right?)-- alternates between cruel and caring, craven and courageous, and may be the most complex character in recent TV history... which is a compliment.  Teddy Dunn plays Duncan with the right amount of all-American charm and guarded mysteriousness, and Francis Capra offers an outstanding performance as the tough-guy-biker-gang-leader-with-a-heart-of-not-gold-but-at-least-silver Weevil.  Throw in recurring roles from accomplished actors like Harry Hamlin as Logan's famous actor/abusive father Aaron Echolls, and you have to pinch yourself to remember you haven't died and gone to TV heaven. <br /> <br />Some of the best examples of what's right with the small screen have fizzled out after too short of time.  Now that UPN has given Veronica Mars a second chance, don't miss the opporunity to check out the mastery of interweaving plots, intriguing week-to-week mysteries, and high-caliber acting.  Hey, if Joss Whedon likes it, it's gotta be good.
0790729407|3.0|I expected a little more from this movie but after 20 minutes of this movie, I realized it was just another dull british drama.  Michael Collins is a good movie to see if you want to gain a little knowledge of Irish history. However, there is unfortunately little else of note that makes this movie worth sitting for two hours. Aside from the very talented Stephen Rea's work, the acting is terrible. Aidan Quinn seems to forget at times that he's supposed to have an Irish accent, and even when he remembers his accent sounds terrible.  It is an important story, but difficult to translate to film, and Jordan did what he could with his resources. In the hands of a lesser writer/director, the film could have been disastrous. If you really have nothing else to do, it wouldn't hurt to watch this movie, but don't expect a masterpiece. Julia Roberts was a huge miscast in this film.. very poor choice.  Someone tell this woman that she CANNOT do accents.
B000002W9P|5.0|Don't be fooled by these ignorant reviewers that got into metal last week, this album is a MASTERPIECE! It's in MetalRules top 100 metal albums list for a reason. I think Helloween gets alot of flak from the Thash metal idiots because it is just a little too much beyond their small minds for comprehension, too melodic, too much musicianship. Oh, I know for a fact that  \\"Socailist MetalHead\\" and \\"Trooper\\" are one and the same, considering Amazon only lets you review once. I'm going off point though.... <br /> <br />Bands like Slayer, Kreator, ect are simply gimmicks. These bands play on the big bad satanic theme to make up for lack of talent and musical knowledge. These bands suck essentially, thier sound hasn't evolved past 1986, while Helloween constantly evolves. To compare Kerry King, whom simply plays random notes as fast as possible,lacking a concept of scales and modes, to a god like Kai Hansen, is just laughable. Even for retarded thrash fans (which is an obsolete gendre, mind you), your knowledge of thrash sucks also, since when was Pantera ever a thrash band? <br /> <br />Whatever, Keeper of the Seven Keys 1 (and 2) are friggin metal classics. I would go even so far as to say that Helloween is the second most important and influential metal band out of Germany (after Accept of course). All i can say is that these guys are still ripping it up, and are absolute gods in the european metal scene, while Slayer has become a mallcore band. I would suggest you pick this up and it's brother and see what a talented heavy metal group sounds like. <br /> <br />C'mon now, did Slayer invent a whole new gendre of music with thier banal sound? I didn't think so...
B000002J6F|5.0|The first concert I ever went to was Stephen Stills and Manassas at Carnegie Hall in 1972. I didn't know who Chris Hillman was, or Al Perkins. I knew I loved Stills' music from CSN&Y, his voice and guitar playing just stood out for me. <br /> <br />I was blown away by the show, and got the album soon after. As a teenager, I must have listened to this album over 1,000 times. As a musician and guitar player and songwriter, it set a standard for me.  <br /> <br />Stills will always remain a favorite for me, largely on the basis of this album. \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" still holds up as a perfect tune - it's criminal the song wasn't a hit back then. The acoustic songs are shimmering and the blues/rock tunes really groove. I went on to seek out older Chris Hillman & Byrds & Flying Burrito Brothers music - from there, Gram Parsons & on to Emmylou - this record opened up a host of music to me at 13.  <br /> <br />Stills music never grabbed me the same way after this album. Whether it was his own personal demons, or chemistry with subsequent bands, he never again attained these heights. <br /> <br />I think it was that the combination of musicianship and relaxed non-ego types (Chris Hillman worked with Gram Parsons, for God's sake, you know he has to be pretty easygoing!) allowed Stills to soar and be a leader.  <br /> <br />This was a great band and album, and I'm happy to see it again - now that my turntable finally bit the dust, it will be nice to hear these tunes after many years.  <br /> <br />Of course the CD doesn't come with a cool poster, complete with photos and handwritten lyrics by Stills, the way the vinyl album did!

B000089RV6|5.0|Back In Black, was released in 1980. This was the first album That AC/DC recorded without frontman Bon Scott, who had died due to alcohol related problems. Brian Johnson, was picked to fill Bon's place, although admitted by Brian, he was there more to pay tribute to Bon than anything. Before I write this review I must make a couple points, first Back In Black, is the fifth best selling album in American music history, second it is the second best selling hard rock album, second only to Led Zepplin's 4. If that don't tell you something nothing will.<br /><br /> Hells Bells 10/10 - This is the quintessential opening track to this or any album. From the first toll of the bell to the last scream from Brian. Great song, and before you know it you'll be screaming at the top of your lungs HELLS BELLS!!!<br /><br />Shoot To Thrill 10/10 - This is another hard rock gem, an awesome song that really gets your heart pumping. One listen to this and you'll be hooked.<br /><br />What Do You Do For Money Honey 10/10 - This is a song about a very promiscuous woman, who does nice favors for people. Just listen you'll get it, its funny and rockin' what better combo?<br /><br />Givin The Dog A Bone 15/10 - Well now, this is my second favorite AC/DC song, ( the first being Stiff Upper Lip ) this is straight up powerful RROCK 'N' ROLL! From the opening hit of the drum till the last note played, just plain awesome, I'm sure you'll agree.<br /><br />Let Me Put My Love Into You 10/10 - Let Me Put My Love Into You, I am almost sure this is a sexual reference, but I can't be positive. This is a tad bit slower than the others, but don't misunderstand me it still kicks butt!!<br /><br />Back In Black 15/10 - AHH!! Right here is the most notable song on the whole album. This is AC/DC's tribute to Bon Scott, and what a tribute it is. If you have never heard this song, before you play it, turn your stereo up as loud as you can and blow your head off!!!  Well don't do that, but enjoy it anyway you like, great track.<br /><br />You Shook Me All Night Long 10/10 - This is probably the most radio friendly song ever recorded by AC/DC. It is also one of their most popular for that reason i'm sure. This is a great song, but if you have heard it as many times as me it gets kinda boring, but awesome  anyways!<br /><br />Have A Drink On Me 10/10 - This is another tribute to Bon, at least thats what I say. I know I am not AC/DC, but just listen to the lyrics, and you'll see.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|I've noticed a few reviews mentioning that the film isn't saying anything relevant about social tolerance and that it wouldn't have received the attention it has or considered \\"groundbreaking\\" if the story was about a man and a woman falling in love instead of two men. Those people are not only wrong, but they're also missing the entire point of the film. If the story was between a man and a woman instead of two men, there simply would be no Brokeback Mountain; there would be no story to tell because the whole subject and theme of the film lies within two MEN who fall in love and the conflict of their own feelings towards each other. Besides being a love story (a beautiful and profoundly moving one at that), Brokeback Mountain is also (as the Amazon reviewer accurately puts it) a social study about the \\"ripple effects\\" that the denial of this love has not only on Ennis and Jack, but also on those close to them. Being forced to live a life of lies, secrecy, doubt and emotional disconnection because the people around just don't understand what you're going through. And that's what makes the film so powerful and insightful.  <br /> <br />I've read other reviews condemning Jack and Ennis' affair because the film supposedly wants to sympathize with two men cheating on their wives. Again, people missing the point. As mentioned early, that is one of the \\"ripple effects\\" of Ennis and Jack not being able to fulfill their love. You see, if society was fully accepting of homosexual relationships at the time (not that they completely are now) the film is set in, Ennis and Jack would've never been forced to marry women and live a life of lies, secrets and unfulfilment. Not only wasn't homosexuality not accepted by society at the time, but gays were also MURDERED just for being gays, as the film points out in Ennis' flashback. So basically, these men just couldn't live as they were, so they had no choice but live \\"normal\\" lives.  <br /> <br />That brings me to the other theme thefilm tackles, which is self-acceptance. Within their social context, Ennis and Jack didn't see themselves as gay because they simply didn't accept it or even approached the concept. So when they realize how they feel for each other, they just don't know what to make of their feelings; they deny and even reject their own nature (\\"I ain't queer\\"). It's not only about society not accepting their \\"kind\\" of love, it's about THEM not fully accepting and giving in to each other; especially Ennis, whose fear and complete inability to accept both himself and Jack's love is what ultimately dooms them, which makes the love story even more devastating. <br /> <br />Anyone who can't understand what the film's message is and what it's aiming for either needs to have a moral and conscience check, or is simply beyond help.
B000BP86OG|3.0|If The Darkness avoids the sophomore slump on One Way Ticket to Hell...And Back, they also steer clear of anything surprising, incredible or new. There are a few Middle Eastern-tinged sections scattered through the 35-minute disc, but otherwise it might as well have been called Permission to Land, Only Not as Good. <br /> <br />That's not to say One Way Ticket doesn't have its successes. \\"Knockers,\\" despite its juvenile title, is quite the song, as is \\"Dinner Lady Arms.\\" \\"Bald\\" blends raunchy riffs with hilarious lyrics to great effect. Several of the other tracks get a little better with each listen. <br /> <br />The problem is that, at 10 songs total, all of them should be that good, but they're not. \\"Blind Man\\" is a snooze, and \\"English Country Garden\\" never seems to click. \\"Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time\\" is a massive title for mediocre if listenable songwriting, while \\"Girlfriend\\" makes listeners want to rip out the singer's testicles-in-a-vice-falsetto-crazed vocal cords. Maybe next time, fans of the band will get more than 20 minutes worth of top-notch material.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I love that the editorial review references The Sea And Cake (which is one band), and then that A. Cheng guy says that Cake and the Sea are two of his favourite bands but he doesn't see the influence. What a knob.
B000001A3H|5.0|by now im sure you have all heard of queens of the stone age and probably heard of kyuss. this by far is their best offering because this album features brant, nick, john and josh in all their glory. every track here flows great and features awesome song writing from brant and josh. before you buy anything in the stoner/desert rock section buy this first!
B000BVD460|3.0|i m a huge fan of eminem and i like his music.......the hits are great but i'll write this review on the basis of his 3 new tracks <br />when i am gone - 10/10 - great track <br />shake that feat nate dogg - 5/10 - mediocre track...more like a nate dogg song <br />fack - 0/10 - i hate this track...seriously <br /> <br />so overall, maybe 3.5 stars
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Nu-metal has been dead for quite some time, but waning trends didn't keep Korn from dropping its best album in years. See You on the Other Side abandons the group's relentless angst for a groove-heavy but no less twisted sound. <br /> <br />Virtually every track is a classic waiting to happen. From the opening ode to sex \\"Twisted Transistor\\" to the \\"We Will Rock You\\" beat of \\"Coming Undone,\\" Other Side is a sick head-bobbing delight. Where bands like Limp Bizkit (didja hear that Wes Borland re-joined the group? Didn't think so.) and Staind (whose sound hasn't changed over the last three albums) have faded since the late `90s, Korn marches on through the funky sludge of seven-string guitars and depraved lyricism.
B00006JU7T|5.0|This is just a great cop movie.Al Pacino's acting is superb.He really should have won the Oscar.This movie is a true story of Frank Serpico who battled corruption throughout NewYork City during The late 1960's and early 1970's. I say throughout beacause he was being transfored to so called non-corrupt divisions.\\"Serpico\\" really shows you how frusterating it really was for him. I reccomend it for anybody who enjoys an excellent movie.
0805076476|5.0|That's the first word that comes to mind when I first read this. Unfortunately was introduced to Palahniuk through the film. Reading it as a young man, this book blew my hair back. Made me think and look about values of modern society in different ways. Was my first introduction to a number of themes like living in the present, and how surrounding yourself with acquisitions end up defining you as a person, and should not. Seems to be full of eastern ideas told in a western post-modern-ish way, that's violent enough for youth to enjoy. Not Palahniuk's best work but a great introduction to it.
0393314804|4.0|Trainspotting, by Irvine Welsh, is a book about a multiple of Scottish fellows, who are brought together by their addiction for heroin rather than their liking for each other. Renton, or Rent for short, is trying to overcome his addiction to live up to his parents' dreams. He and his friends have some good times and some bad times throughout their highs and shagging. Even though he thoroughly enjoys how he lives, he realizes that he should be living his life in a healthier drug and crime free way and eventually overcomes his addiction and chooses life over drugs. <br />I enjoyed reading the book very much it is written in a strong British tongue that makes it kind of difficult to understand sometimes, but you get through it and get deep into the book. Irvine Welsh is a very intellect writer and is very easy to enjoy. <br />
B000EHRVP6|3.0|\\"Saw\\" series fans take note: \\"Hostel\\" is the latest gore-filled cinematic treat of choice. Its brutal torture scenes, though they could have been far more graphic, are sure to titillate drama lovers' darker sides. The plot revolves around an Eastern European warehouse where visitors can pay to torture and kill captured victims. <br /> <br />The film, however, has a number of important problems. For one, the first half-hour or so is pure sex, chronicling how three young males are captured by Slovakian hunters masquerading as loose women. Not to object to 30 minutes of nonstop boobage, but it really isn't that integral to the storyline. <br /> <br />Secondly, the ending sequence is so happy it's absurd (well, maybe \\"happy\\" isn't the right word for it). The audience enjoys what happens, but believability takes a backseat to the catharsis. <br /> <br />Finally, there is obviously some kind of statement in that Americans are worth the most for torture, either because they're rarer in this corner of the world or because America is, you know, evil and all that. It's hard to tell what Roth was going for here, but as commentary it's mildly troubling instead of convincing, incisive or perceptive. <br /> <br />Essentially, \\"Hostel\\" is a worthwhile soft-core porn/gruesome horror flick, but its plot problems leave it far short of classic status.

B00003W8NM|5.0|Ok, so Pulp Fiction is, but this is right up there. Pitt and Norton are great. I missed it in the theatre's, like most, but didn't know much about the film when I saw it, which is great because it had such a profound affect on me. I've seen this dozens of times and holds up on every viewing. Carter is maddening and heartbreaking all at once. It's very dark and has great effects and camera movement, as you would expect from Fincher. Kind of Michael Bay actually done well. If you don't know a whole lot about this movie, stop reading, go buy it (it's a must own) and enjoy!
B00005JOUM|5.0|Inside Man is a fascinating, suspenseful bank heist / hostage story. The robbers cleverly dress their hostages all in the same kind of diguises they're wearing, so the cops can't tell bad guys from victims.  But the fact they're taking time to implement such an elaborate scheme - rather than taking the money and escaping - seems to indicate they're after some particular thing other than the money.<br /><br />Denzel Washington and Willem Dafoe play cops handling the situation, Christopher Plummer is the bank president, who hires Jodie Foster, some sort of private eye, to try to prevent the robbers from getting some particular thing in the bank, other than the money.<br /><br />It's fascinating and suspenseful, well written and well-acted, and the only problem I had with the whole film was that they didn't explain, at the end, how the bank robbers knew in the first place about some particular thing they were after, other than the money. They do leave room for you to figure that out yourself, though.

B000002UD0|4.0|John Lennon topped the US Singles chart for the first time in 1974 with the hit Whatever Gets You Thru The Night, a radio-friendly duet with Elton John.  <br /> <br />Following the success of the single came the album Walls And Bridges. Despite mixed reviews, the album contained some of the best songs and music Lennon had written throughout his entire career: the soulful Going Down On Love; the rhythmic What You Got (that sounds a lot like Stevie Wonder's Superstition); the slow and beautiful Old Dirt Road (co-written by Harry Nilsson); the dark rock tune Scared, which follows past songs like Isolation; a subliminal angry message to former agent Allen Klein in Steel In Glass (that uses the same musical pattern of How Do You Sleep); the affectionate ballad #9 Dream, also a song for Yoko; and what could possibly be the highlight on Walls And Bridges, the Dylanesque Nobody Loves You (When You're Down And Out), where Lennon expresses his feelings of depression and loneliness in such an honest way.  <br /> <br />Walls And Bridges may not be the best Lennon album, but it is definitely one of his standout contributions to rock history.  <br /> <br />Recommended  <br /> <br />B+
B000E97Y6K|4.0|OK, first of all, you may wonder why only 4 stars.  Well, let me explain.<br /><br />This film is first and fore-most a visual feast for the eyes.  The level of detail in all of the films locations and set pieces is truely draw-dropping.  From the creatures to the ship to Skull Island and even New York itself, the level of computer image technology, model and miniature work today is truely outstanding.  (Watch the Production Diaries to see what I mean.)<br /><br />Anyway, so why the 4 stars?  Well if you wanna watch Peter Jackson's King Kong for a well thought out acted drama, go elsewhere.  Wait...why would I say that?  Well, once the action gets to the island and the ship's crew is chasing down Kong and Anna, there's very little dialogue.  Just a bunch of screaming and shooting and dying.  Which is good thing and fitting for the scenes, but there's very little verbal reasoning for advancing the story in the normal way if you know what I mean.  Basically what I'm saying is that the action on screen advances the story on its own, I guess.  We're talking \\"the thrill of the chase\\" so-to-speak.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like to watch modern movies for eye candy, well look no further.  This film has got to be the most lavish film I have ever seen.  The environments are so detailed that they really look alive.  No other Kong movie has even come close to this level of realism in that department.  The multitude of creatures that WETA created for this film is truely phenomenal.  I was sitting there, watching the DVD, saying \\"They must've spent of bundle for all these effects shots.\\"  I was even impressed with the CG New York skyline for the final Empire State Building scene.  Trying to create a authentic 1933 New York skyline and cityscape in the computer would not be easy either.  The Biplane attack sequence at the end was very spectacular.  I've never seen anything as unique as that.  Very creative camera shots.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the sound is good too.  The current DVD only comes with a DD 5.1 track, but it's still very good with deep solid bass for Kong's growl and other creature effects.  Hopefully the rumored extended edition will come with a DTS track...and some commentaries!<br /><br />But back to the 4 star thing.  I'd give it 5, but the lack of conventional story telling and having the story action driven is usually not a good method of making a film.  However, in this case, the method works, but I was looking for a little more character development for some of the minor characters, and even some additional development to explain some of the main characters' motivations.<br /><br />Anyway...still a solid movie and one to be a masterpiece for sure.  Even though the Oscars pretty much snubbed it, I'd say Kong (2005) will have a cult following for years to come.  Basically this ain't gonna be Godzilla (1998) if you know what I mean.rent DVD only comes with a DD 5.1 track, but it's still very good with deep solid bass for Kong's growl and other creature effects.

0307276902|5.0|I read this book after the whole world knew Oprah was all bent out of shape about it. That's the main reason I picked it up, to see what all the fuss was about. <br /> <br />First few chapters I was thinking, \\"What a self-serving, arrogant $#%&#$. This book is a piece of #$*%, and it's all lies.\\" The seemingly Random Capitalization of words irritated me almost to the point of putting it down, in the beginning. <br /> <br />But I'm glad I held on.  Because this is a great MotherFrucking book. I could not put it down once I got into it.  Frey's story like it or not has and will continue to help people, and I believe, help save lives in one way or another. <br /> <br />Did Frey tell a pack of lies?  <br />He sure did.  <br />Lies.  <br />Lies.  <br />Lies.  <br />About <br />really Important <br />Things. <br />It's actually creepy when you go to The Smoking Gun Web site and check out the details. <br /> <br />But for making me think, laugh out loud, and cry, and reminding me about the Tao, and for introducing me to Leonard and Lilly and Hank and his jacket and Miles, and making me step back from my life and feel a sense of gratitude, well, if that doesn't deserve 5 stars, I don't know what does.  <br /> <br />Thank you, James Frey, for this book.  <br /> <br />If you give a million little dollars to Oprah's Angel Network,  <br />that would be Honorable and Fair.
0316172324|1.0|My writing would sound a little freaky -try weirdo sometimes- to the western mind; but as a Muslim, what so called Blinks is part of your daily life. You are somehow told to always try to understand by perception what you cannot see by your eyes.<br /><br />I have noticed that far-eastern philosophers and strategists entice their followers in the same manner: thanks God we are not alone in this one as well!!<br /><br />Well, the book is a mess, a kind of mumbo-jumbo worthless ritual, works as multiple articles in a newspaper as one of the reviewers put it; but not in a good one. In some chapters, we are told how brilliant it is to relay on blinks (or on that thin layer of your... whatever) and in others we are told how deadly this could be. In some chapters, mathematics approve the blinking facts, in others chemicals tests disapprove it... so all in all, there are no positive definite evidences, nor negative definite ones: meaning, there is no theory!!<br /><br />So why the author wrote a book about it? Is it to make money, or simply because he know how to write in fluid and smooth way? He really does; and I am almost confident that when he speaks he never stops. Because the book could be 100 pages less if you remove the chewing of the repeated fractions of it; which, somehow -if you are in an airplane for example- could make you believe that you are finding a series of rings that would form a chain ultimately.<br /><br />It is a simple fact that logic theories do not apply on spiritual matters such as perceptions. It has not been proven that brains have layers (like cakes). And it is dead wrong to write books telling us that there are such layers before real science discovers it.
B000E97HIA|2.0|prince is not back just yet. musicology was a mess. it was the first prince album that i couldn't sit and listen to all the way thru. 3121 is an improvement but it feels flat and a little uninspired. i've always been excited when prince had a new album coming out but since his conversion...that \\"spark\\" of genius...that raw, sometimes erotic influence is not seen anywhere in his music. it is like he has a chastity belt on his brain. i'm not saying he has to say every filthy thing that comes to his mind but come on, sex is always on the brain if you're a guy...even if you are 4' 10\\" and built like a woman. i rather he be an unpronounceable symbol than a convert. but like another reviewer said he's gotta be happy, that's what's important. <br /> <br />but for those of you who are calling this better than anything he did in the 80's or 90's....WHAT?!

B000069HKH|5.0|I guess it seems kind of odd to be expressing my thoughts about The Rising after four years. Not really. Not for \\"Tramps Like Us\\". For anyone who doesn't know who or what \\"Tramps Like Us\\" are. We are Bruce's fanatical fans who used to camp out to hopefully get tickets for his shows. <br /> <br />I felt like writing this after I listened to The Rising tonight because I felt that the album had said some things to me tonight that it hasn't before. You see, Bruce has had a segregated following during his whole career. When his albums come out, \\"Tramps Like Us\\" are usually at the store as the album is being unboxed. It may hit No. 1 on the charts, and maybe it doesn't. If it does, it says there for maybe a week or two. I just told you why. We Bruce fans buy it right away instead of waiting to think about it. We can't wait to hear what new stuff Bruce has to say. It's been said many times that Merle Haggard is The Poet of the Common Man. Which is true. Bruce is the Poet Who Came After Dylan But Has Matured Beyond All Other Rock and Rollers. I used to be a huge Rolling Stones fan until they brought out albums with songs like \\"Too Much Blood\\" and started charging $300.00 for tickets, forgetting who put them where they are today. <br /> <br />As time has gone with Bruce though, in comparison, is that his music has matured. Sure, at his shows, you'll always see alot of the old Boss. But, when 911 came along Bruce decided to write alot of meaningful stuff about what had happened that fateful day, and what life was all about in our world we are living in. But, the strange thing about Bruce's music, especially his lyrics, when you listen to the songs over and over, depending on your general mood at the time, you seem to come away with maybe a completely different opinion on what was said in the song.It's like the title track, \\"The Rising\\". The first verse goes: <br /> <br />Can't see nothin' in front of me <br />Can't see nothin' coming up behind <br />I make my way through thisdarkness <br />I can't feel nothing but this chain that binds me <br />Lost track of how far I've gone <br />How far I've gone, how high I've climbed <br />On my back's a sixty pound stone <br />On my shoulder a half mile of line <br /> <br />You see, when Bruce initially wrote these words, and released them, everyone, including myself, said that Bruce is attempting to describe what it must have been like for the firefighters and other rescuers when they were scaling the steps or whatever, going up into The Twin Towers to hopefully save lives. Yes, he was. But, four years later, when you listen to those lyrics, Bruce could be simply talking about \\"life\\" itself. If you don't believe me, read them, and think about what I've said. Think about your own life. <br /> <br />That's what is so special about all of Bruce's music. This man is a genious. His music may seem to say one thing to you today, but as the years go by, the same song may mean something totally different to you as a listener. So, if you didn't give The Rising a chance when it came out, think about giving it another chance without 911 in your mind. Yes, you are going to hear certain songs like \\"You're Missing\\" that will always remind you of that terrible day. But, that's good too, because we should never forget. Thanks for listening to this \\"Tramp\\". But, do yourself a favor, and listen to the original tramp.
B00001U0DP|5.0|The use of humor throughout the film Life is Beautiful allows the movie to accurately represent the horrors of World War II without being dark. One could argue that the humor takes away from the seriousness, dignity, and respect with which the Holocaust should be portrayed. However, there already exists an abundance of humorless, depressing movies concerning the Holocaust and the Second World War. Also, the humor is not at the expense of the Jewish people, but rather the [...] ideals. In my favorite scene, in which the main character jumps up on the table in the school and showcases himself as an example of the racial purity of the Italians, the whole notion of racial purity is being made fun of, since he is in reality a Jewish person himself.    I personally think that using comedy in this film was a great idea. The comedic aspect of this movie has helped it reach a much wider audience than the vast majority of Holocaust related movies. The fact that Life is Beautiful is relatively well-known in the United States is an achievement in and of itself, seeing as Americans tend to dislike having to read sub-titles and not be able to understand Italian. It would certainly be possible for a movie to go completely overboard, trying to make everything into a joke, which would have the effect of cheapening the war and the Holocaust. A movie that contains so many jokes that it approaches absurdity and completely neglects the trauma and horrors of the Holocaust would be offensive and very hurtful to those people who experienced the Holocaust first-hand.

I don't know who did the translation but I hope it's as close to original meaning as possible.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird, written in 1960, is a work that I feel has literary value and is worth examining.  It is a story of a father, Atticus Finch, in small-town Maycomb, Alabama during the depression who is raising his two children on his own.  Jem is the older brother who is constantly initiating explorations, and Scout is the tomboyish younger sister who helps him stir up trouble.  Their mother died when they were small children, and Calpurnia was a black woman who kept house and watched over the children while Atticus was working as a lawyer.  It has many subplots, but the mainly the novel is about a legal case in which Atticus is fighting a battle he knows he can't win.  He is defending a black man, Tom Robinson, that he knows is not guilty of the murder of a white man.  As racism was still common during the depression, Tom Robinson was essentially automatically guilty, but Atticus decides to fight for him regardless. <br />After reading this piece three times, I have come upon and changed many opinions concerning it.  The first time I read this novel, I didn't like it at all.  I didn't understand how a book could be titled To Kill a Mockingbird and only mention mockingbirds three times in its duration.  Reading it a second time with newly acquired maturity and comprehension, the title made more sense to me, making the reading experience less frustrating.  As a ninth grade honors English student, I was finally forced to take the book for more than its face value and truly appreciate all it had to offer.  The development of characters is exquisite, the uses of metaphors are intense, and the underlying theme of the novel was one that kept me coming back to further understand it. <br />     Harper Lee spends a great deal of time describing new characters in this novel.  Although the specific details of the physical appearances, backgrounds, and mannerisms of each character might seem to some as redundant and a waste of good page space, I feel it really enriched the experience for me.  When I know that Calpurnia was \\"all angles and bones; she was nearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard ,\\" I can create an image in my mind.  I no longer picture a simple, black housekeeper; I see a woman who works with dedication and vigor.  I can imagine her standing in my own kitchen, squinting out the window at my brother and me causing trouble.  I feel that this descriptive mental image further ties me into the story.   <br />     The mockingbird is a simply a \\"common grayish bird, especially of the southern U.S. that is remarkable for its exact imitations of the notes of other birds ,\\" until it is used in this novel.  It then takes on a much deeper meaning as a contextual symbol.  In this novel, the use of symbolism as a metaphoric method is extremely prevalent.  Mockingbirds represent innocence.  When their uncle gives Scout and Jem air rifles, Atticus tells them they can shoot as many bluebirds as they want, but reminds them that, \\"...it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. \\"  This is because mockingbirds do one thing, and that is make music that people enjoy, as opposed to doing destructive things, like other birds.  To kill a mockingbird would be to kill an innocent creature, which is mirrored in Atticus' case with the innocent Tom Robinson.  This symbolism really made me interact with what I was reading, because it was a lesson I firmly believed in and was taught as I was growing up.  When a literary piece captures my beliefs or thoughts or feelings like that, it really connects me on a deeper level that makes the experience much more intense because it is personal. <br />     Atticus also teaches his children that they can \\"never really understand a person until you consider things from his point-of-view... \\" This theme is not only something I can also relate to, but it is used in a repetitive, but not redundant, way in the novel.  Harper Lee provides examples of this so discreetly that it takes a great deal of focus to pick them out.  When a mob is threatening Atticus for his defense of Tom Robinson, Scout picks a man out of the crowd and talks to him about his child that is her age.  This made him back down from the mob's threats, because she put the man into her father's position, as a parent who was teaching right and wrong.  This need for heightened concentration on the text really made the book thrilling above its existing entertainment on the basic level.  When I had to give the extra attention to the small, seemingly unimportant events in the novel, it made the story come to life and provided me with a desire to delve further into what Harper Lee had hidden in this book for me to discover.   <br />     To Kill a Mockingbird is a literary work that has had an impact on my life in many ways.  I was encouraged to follow the lessons my parents had instilled in me during my childhood, including being understanding of other people and the challenges in their lives and recognizing, valuing and respecting innocence.  I really interacted with the characters and metaphors in a story for the first time while reading a novel.  I learned that novels can be much more complex than we take them to be, but sometimes it takes patience and focus to find out what the author is trying to tell us.  It was the first book I ever examined at a deeper level, and it is still the book I have spent the most time digging into and contemplating.  For this reason, I can say I truly liked this novel. <br />
0064400557|4.0|I just, as an adult, read this lovely story, initially about a little girl who saves a runt piglet, but ultimately about the saving power of long-term friendship. Wilbur (the pig) meets a kind spider (Charlotte) who endeavors to save him from the fate of most farm pigs. We see Wilbur grow up and deal with fear, loneliness, and even the passing of a friend, all with the soft, easy prose of E.B. White (who, after all, wrote THE BOOK on writing - Strunk & White's Elements of Style). I look forward to reading this to my children.
0684843749|5.0|I have been weight training for five years and can not stress enough the value of this book. For the first three years I listened to personal trainers and a few friends doing a fairly normal workout routine to change my overweight body. This produced little to no results. I met a bodybuilder two years ago that was a big Arnold fan and unknown to myself he gave me Arnold's beginner workout program. I started seeing results; however, I eventually stopped the program because I had hit stagnation. I did not have access to anything that would show me how to push my limits even further, just what \\"the trainers\\" told me again. Basically your average medium sets, medium reps, and circuit training workout programs. Enough to keep my current weight stable with the prospect of shedding a few pounds and to gain small amounts of muscle over the long term. The don't overtrain mentality 3-4 times a week! Great for some! <br /> <br />I wanted more, I'm human. Eventually I called up my then bodybuilding \\"personal trainer\\" friend and he reluctantly revealed to me this book; \\"his secret\\", that is actually available to everyone. I picked it up and started following Arnold's next program level. More results. I am now into the advanced programs and never felt healthier or happier with my body and can honestly say I have greater control over my physical appearance than I ever imagined possible. People that claim this book will overtrain you I do not believe have looked at the entire book or fully understand Arnold's fundamental arguments. Perhaps unfortunately they are also looking out for their own interests. We can't blame them though, they are human!  <br /> <br />The beginner programs in this book used with proper weight for your body will show results and should not even come close to overtraining if you are using low weight. Yes, 6 days a week! What about time? If you have a career or have kids Arnold says wake up early. He asks how serious are you about wanting to change and control your body or what are your goals? I can not stress that enough and Arnold makes it clear to push yourself to realistic goals! Do not dive into the deep end. A good section in-directly speaking to overtraining (besides the one devoted to the topic) is the one on bodytypes. For example, Arnold's information tells you; If you have a natural athletic body you can probably start a bit harder. Where as an endomorph (gains fat easily) may want to focus on cardio more and getting up their energy level and fatigue resistance.  <br /> <br />I would even argue a beginner could use his low level advanced programs lifting \\"the appropriate\\" level of weight and make gains without over-training. For example, let us pretend \\"joe beginner\\" can bench 100 pounds over 4 - 8 reps. When Arnold says do 6 sets of Bench presses starting with 15 reps he means start way lower than what you can do, maybe at 25-30 pounds, maybe 40 on a high enegry day and end on the 100. Eventually when fully rested, following that beginner level pyramid, doing 100 pounds for 4-8 reps will be a joke. Realize how many sets and exercises he is telling you to do and adjust accordingly! Don't start at 90 and then try and go to 150, you'll be dead for the next exercise, and will over-train! Lets say someone can bench 30 pounds for 4 - 8 reps, start at 8. For his programs to work, you have to suck up the pride and go as low as is necessary to not overtrain but finish the workout(This is all covered in his beginner section!). I have a secret for you..no one in the gym cares about how much your lifitng and if they do, you shouldn't. Arnold also mentions many other similar mind over body / environment ideas.  <br /> <br />Negative reviews also mention Arnold took steroids. I imagine he did but steroids should never be used*. I believe Arnold's program can be used completely without supplements and give results. However, taking protein, glutamine, and some of the other modern supplements may help if you are feeling over-trained. If you are still, despite the supplements, as I said before lower the weight. Some bodies need supplements (sorry did I say supplements? Should have said \\"a proper diet\\"!). This is an unavoidable reality if you are burning over 1000 calories a day on training. Like Arnold points out look at safe supplements more like food (because that is where most modern supplements come from). If you are taking CLA, protein, vitamins, and appropriate amino acids you are really only altering your diet. Arnold's book does provide diets that will be giving you all these \\"supplements\\". (*Arnold makes it explicit that fat burners are fake enegry and steroids are off limits). <br /> <br />The core idea behind Arnold's message that some reviewers are missing is that to achieve success and change your body takes dedication, alot of hard work, and a long-term plan (a plan from this book, an expensive trainer, or maybe your own probably misinformed ideas). Arnold provides that plan for a minimal price compared to what \\"the trainers\\" will offer! Sure he makes some \\"scientific\\" mistakes. But if you wanted to learn how to fight would you rather learn from Bruce Lee or an exercise physiologist? Would you tell Bruce his ideas about kicking are wrong because it is impossible to be like a tiger? The same practicality / ideas in practice are needed in bodybuilding; as Arnold suggests look at it like an art. Scientists can tell you what they want but ultimately you have to push your body to the limits to get results. There is no such thing as a \\"genetic freak\\", I haven't seen any mutants around the gym lately, just people that know what they are or are not doing. Sure our genes dictate our predispositions but our free egos allow us to influence our own mind and consequently bodies.  <br /> <br />Following Arnold's advice, eventually going to the gym 6 days a week will be heaven and not hell. The pain of a heavy workout will be welcome and your body will adapt and recover faster than you ever would believe possible, leaving you with energy you never thought you could have. Arnold's book is a good place to start for any person wishing to change their life and body. Just read it carefully and understand the principles.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|\\"Sahara\\" is the film adaptation of Cussler's mildly-successful book \\"Sahara,\\" based on the adventures of Dirk Pitt, a poor man's James Bond who goes through life one adventure at a time and always seems to find some long lost treasure at the end of the book.  As a stand-alone film, \\"Sahara\\" is a lot like \\"National Treasure\\" and \\"The Mummy.\\" It can be very cheesy and there are way to many coincidences (Pitt wanders through the Saharan Desert and just happens to come up on Eva getting attacked a second time), but if you can suspend your disbelief, you will probably enjoy it as an entertaining popcorn-flick.<br /><br />If you're a Clive Cussler fan you may have problems though. I can understand why Cussler did not want to be associated with this film.  It is only loosely based on his book.  Of course films always have to change books when doing film adaptations, but only a few of the main ideas were kept for the film, and the biggest flaw is that the characters of Pitt and Giordino were horribly mis-cast.  Pitt is supposed to be an \\"ordinary-looking\\" man, not People Magazine's Sexiest Man of the Year.  McConaughey comes across too much like a stereotypical surfer-Keanu Reeves type.  Al Giordino appears to be changed into the bumbling idiot sidekick, a role very similar to the sidekicks in \\"National Treasure\\" and \\"The Mummy.\\"  The only other major flaw with the film is the soundtrack, which sounds like it was thrown together by the staff of the Today Show and is a weird mix of classic rock songs that don't seem to make much sense (eg, Pitt and Giordino are driving down the Niger river in their boat and the movie blasts into Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" for no reason.)<br /><br />Overall, if you're a big Cussler fan and you're approaching this film as your chance to see one of your favorite protagonists realized on screen, you will be disappointed.  However if you're watching Sahara as a mindless way to kill two hours, it's not too bad of a film, and will likely keep you entertained.likely keep you entertained.
B000E97Y6K|1.0|Maybe they looked cool in the theatre, but at home this movie just looked absolutely horrible.  It was really lame and boring, despite it's having lots of fight scenes.  I have to admit I actually turned it off 2 hours into it.  Really sucked.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|For someone who never watches TV and has never been that impressed by 24 and all the other \\"great\\" series on TV recently, coming across Firefly was a unique experience.  An amazing cast, writing that is overflowing with wit, character development and excellent plot twists, and a simple idea that strong storylines are better than flashy action.  There's chemistry among the crew members with tangible tension. there's a great sense of humor and laugh-out-loud moments.  The only negative about the show is the fact that FOX in their infinite wisdom pulled the plug on it just as it was stretching its legs.   <br /> <br />The movie will serve another way to whet the appetite, but this show needs to continue.   <br /> <br />The only real comparison i can find for this show is the stellar Cowboy Bebop which was originally a japanese anime series of a similar space cowboy theme.   <br /> <br />Buy this DVD series and the Serenity movie and show Fox and Universal that people want more!!!!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I have not a single complaint about this soundtrack, save for the fact that much of the festive ball music is missing.  Upon much research, I've discovered that many of them were authentic English Country dance tunes that can probably be found online or off another CD.  For those interested, here's a listing: <br /> <br />1.  Black Bess - Jane and Mr. Bingley's first dance at the Meryton Townhall and when Elizabeth asks Mr. Darcy if he dances (\\"Not if I can help it\\") <br /> <br />2.  The Young Widow - Major ensemble dance at the Meryton Townhall while Mr. Darcy and Caroline Bingley stood watching.  Included is when Charlotte was dancing with Mr. Bingley and when Mr. Darcy watched Elizabeth. <br /> <br />3.  Wakefield Hunt - After Elizabeth tells Mr. Darcy that the way to encourage affection is through dancing, and she turns and walks away. <br /> <br />4.  Duke of Gloucester's March - The arrival at the Netherfield ball when Elizabeth is walking through the house looking for Mr. Wickham. <br /> <br />5.  The Bishop - Elizabeth's dance with Mr. Collins at the Netherfield ball. <br /> <br />Hope this helps anyone interested in the festive numbers, aside from these missing pieces, the score included on this soundtrack could not be any better!
B000003C5C|4.0|Death definitely delivered with this album. It is not as raw and guttural as Scream Bloody Gore, but it is still heavy and killer. The lyrics are a bit more thought out rather than just focusing on blood and guts. The production is a bit more polished, but just a bit. Overall, for 1988, this was pretty insane music!  <br /> <br />The album gets off to an awesome start with Leprosy, a six minute headbanger. With this song, the band shows that they are still just as brutal. Chuck's voice is bleak and uncompromising, as always. I love when the song speeds up during the chorus: \\"Leprosy will take control and bring you to your death/ No chance of a normal life to live just like the rest.\\" Great lines right there! AWESOME solo about halfway through the song. Born Dead is a crushing song with powerful lyrics. I love it when Chuck goes \\"Relief does not exist, when you are born to DIE!\\" Best part of the song in my opinion. Forgotten Past starts with a mid-paced sound. The chorus is sung in an almost catchy way and the guitar solo is quite melodic. Probably one of the few moments on this album where there is a melody! Pull the Plug is a classic, and any true Death fan knows it. The lyrics are very bleak, and the song sounds quite different from the rest. It is still heavy, don't get me wrong, but the sound is quite different from the other songs. The best part is when Chuck sings \\"End it now it's all to LAAAAAAAATE\\" Truly bone-chilling that is! We also get an insane guitar solo as well. Open Casket has a heavy intro, especially those drums! Very killer drumming that is. Chuck's voice is particularly brutal on this one! If you can't headbang to this song, then you are crazy because it is a perfect headbanger. <br /> <br />Primitive Ways has lyrics that remind me of the lyrics from Scream Bloody Gore. I love the lines \\"Celebrate the kill of the day/ Then walk among the guts of the fallen prey\\" Some pretty melodic riffs in some parts (just a little melodic). Also a psycho guitarsolo near the end! Left to Die is simply pounding. Chuck sounds really good on this one, he pulls off some sickening shrieks. Very agressive song this is. The guitar solo is simply moving, however. And to close it off, we have Choke on It. It starts off mid-paced, but it later picks up and becomes a typical 80s Death song. The guitar sounds on here are out of this world, they are very eerie. Pretty good closing track. <br /> <br />So overall, if you love death metal, you will eat this one up! I warn you though, if you are used to the band's later progressive metal albums from the 90s, then this album will come as a shock to you. There is little on here in the way of melody, but it makes up for it with crushing power. Some of the songs are a little too similar to each other though, and Rick Rozz's solos are not exactly what I would call great, but Chuck makes up for it, his leads are really good! Just remember that this was 1988, and there were very few albums back then that had this kind of intensity. Chuck sang like almost no other metal singers at that time.  <br /> <br />If you love metal, then look into Leprosy! <br />
B000002A3T|1.0|the one thing i notice as i listen to this album is how much pink floyd needs waters. there in no floyd without him. this album is pretty much a disgrace except for \\"high hopes\\"
B000003C2S|5.0|With their first two albums, Death established themselves as death metal pioneers. Their sound was raw and brutal, but with Spiritual Healing, they proved that there was more than meets the eye when it came to their music. Here, the band begins to add a bit more depth to their music and lyrics. There is a bit more melody as well, which would pave the way for their more progressive albums in the next few years.  <br /> <br />We get off to an amazing start with Living Monstrosity. This is probably one of my favorite Death songs. I love the riffs in this song, and that melodic section around two minutes in is wonderful indeed. Definitely a hint at the melodies on their future albums! Amazing solos as well, with James Murphy taking Rick Rozz's place, the solos got about ten times better. My favorite lines are \\"Never knowing love or hate/ Only pain the drug creates.\\" Now that is powerful. Altering the Future moves at a bit of a slower pace. However the song does pick up a bit around the middle and the solos are very melodic on here. Read the lyrics and you can tell how much better the songwriting is on here. Defensive Personalities picks up the pace. There is some killer drum work on this song. About two minutes in, there is a killer melodic section with more awesome solos. Spiritual Healing is the \\"epic\\" of the album, it clocks in at over seven minutes. It starts off with some killer riffs with a bit of melody thrown in. At first, the song has a slow pace but it soon picks up and gets heavier. The solos on this one are f*cking intense. They go on for about a whole minute! You gotta hear Chuck when he sings \\"No changing your mind, your life you should PAAAAAAY!\\" Truly a sickening scream. Low Life is a dark and angry song. Think of someone that you really hate and dedicate this song to them! It starts off with a very catchy riff. You can really hear the anger in Chuck's voice on this one, especially when he pulls off those unsettling screams. Now that is what I call power! I like when Chuck growls \\"A pathetic excuse for a human being.\\" And then the catchy riff that started the song is played again.  <br /> <br />Within the Mind begins with an odd and somewhat melodic riff. This song moves at a bit of a slower pace. Chuck gives off some more incredible screams and the solos have somewhat of a sad, emotional feeling. Genetic Reconstruction is another cool metal song with heavy riffs and some more fantastic solos (are we sensing a pattern yet?) A very haunting song, or at least it is to me. Killing Spree closes the album. It is a dark and heavy song, possibly the heaviest song on this album. The lyrics to this song are very sombre, but with a song called Killing Spree, what would you expect? The lines \\"Getting bored with his current life/ Rearranging with a knife.\\" seem to stick with me. The solos on here are some of the best, very emotional indeed, you have to hear them. A very unsettling closing song. <br /> <br />This is a terrific album that really needs to be heard! It paved the way for future masterpieces such as Symbolic. Here, the band didn't go for all out brutality like they did with Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy. They focused more on the riffs and threw in some (GASP!) melody. Or maybe I should say that Chuck focused more on riffs and melodies because we all know he was the creative force in this band. In 1990, there wasn't a whole lot of death metal that sounded like this. This album truly was ahead of its time. I would definitely recommend Spiritual Healing to metalheads worldwide. Combine all of this with the fact that you have James Murphy on here, and you have yourself one hell of a metal album!  <br /> <br />It is so unfair that we had to lose Chuck..... <br />
B000006TRV|5.0|this album is absolutely amazing! roger waters is on a different level then the rest of us. hes simply a genius. the music, lyrics, and overall concept is great. its a cd youll listen to over and over and over.
B00000FCBC|5.0|When Garage Inc arrived in 1998, Metallica was at its commercial peak and radio couldn't get enough of them.But on the other hand there was a section of raving lunatics who called themselves fans, that swore and complained about the shift towards alt.rock.Well, Garage Inc. simply blows away anyone interested in this band in terms of musical quality and sheer volume too! <br /> <br />DISC 1: <br />1]Free Speech For The Dumb:This is the only downside to this masterpiece and it really is for the dumb!Stupid lyrics but a nice solo I must say. <br /> <br />2]Its Electric:Nice, catchy song with another crisp solo. <br /> <br />3]Sabbra Cadabra:One of the highlights of Disc 1, this song combines a quality sabbath riff with nice vocals from Het!Superb. <br /> <br />4]Turn The Page:Overplayed by radio stations and with good reason too!Awesome lyrics and vocals combined with very impressive slide guitar work from Kirk.One of my favourite songs ever. <br /> <br />5]Die Die Die My Darling:Catchy song performed perfectly and a nice stop-start beat as well. <br /> <br />6]Loverman:Great vocals and nothing much else.But I still like it. <br /> <br />7]Mercyful Fate:The highlight of Disc 1 for me.This is quality, crunching heavy metal and performed in some style!Hetfield is immaculate in pulling of these riffs and I was amazed at how well Lars pulls off the drumming! <br /> <br />8]Astronomy:Another superb song with nice solo, great roaring vocals and a very calm,controlled feel. <br /> <br />9]Whiskey in the Jar: Very popular song and performed to the levels of precise perfection expected from Metallica.It is noticabley tighter than the other songs and I think the band sensed another commercial success from this number. <br /> <br />10]Tuesdays Gone: A ton of guest artists and not much for the band to showcase.I find it boring because of its length. <br /> <br />11]The More I See:Nothing much to speak of.A regular, solid song. <br /> <br />DISC 2: <br /> <br />1]Helpless:Too longbut still, its interesting enough for the first three minutes. <br /> <br />2]The Small Hours:Takes hours to build up from the first, haunting riff but it is worth it.Nice song. <br /> <br />3]The Wait:Godd song overall,but a little monotonous.I love the chorus. <br /> <br />4]Crash Course ..Surgery:Nice bass line but nothing much else to speak of. <br /> <br />5]Last Caress/Green Hell:I wish Last Caress was longer, since the thrash mayhem of GreenHell doesn't quit make up for the intensity of Last Caress.It is followed by an amusing jam of Run To The Hills. <br /> <br />6]Am I evil:The oldest song here(1984),it sports RTL-style vocals and an timeless riff.Too repetitive in the latter stages. <br /> <br />7]Blitzkrieg:Also from 1984,this song has an intense bass line from Cliff and a great second half.One of the best songs on Disc 2. <br /> <br />8]Breadfan:Takes a jump to 1989 and here we get AJFA sytle growling vocals and great drum work(also AJFA-esque). <br /> <br />9]The Prince:The best song here without doubt.I fell this era(1989) was perfect for Metallica to cover Diamond Head, because they are mature enough in all departments.The guitars and vocals are perfect and the drumming is fabulous.In my opinion one of Lars' best performances. <br /> <br />10]Stone Cold Crazy:Really hard and heavy song that deservedly won a grammy. <br /> <br />11]So What:Perverse lyrics but good music here.A concert favourite. <br /> <br />12]Killing Time:Great sound,good drumming,nice riff and the highlight is the backing vocals.Solid song. <br /> <br />13]Overkill:My least favourite of the Motorhead covers, but still engaging enough. <br /> <br />14]Damage Case:Great song and my favourite Motorhead cover.Super vocals as well. <br /> <br />15]Stone Dead Forever:Quintessential Lemmy as far as the bass goes and it sets the tone for a catchy song. <br /> <br />16]Too Late Too Late:Nice song but not a strong enough album closer. <br /> <br />All in all,a quality Metallica album,with Disc 1 highlighting what 90s Metallica was-catchy and interesting, while Disc 2 showcases their individual abilities, their metal attitude et al.Get this album and don't pay attention to the fools who complain about everything this band does just beause they are so popular
B000ENWKN8|2.0|Rob Zombie is sadly becoming a parody of himself...the past 2 releases since he left White Zombie are all mediocre at best and he continues on the same path with this album.  I think that music has taken a back seat to his now bergeoning movie directing career.  The only redeeming tracks on this album are \\"American Witch\\" and \\"Let it all bleed out\\" which utilize pretty good riffs.  The first hint that RZ was on a major downward spiral was when I heard horns playing on the Sinister Urge album... <br /> <br />My advice would be for him to quit while he is well-behind...he will never recapture the magic of White Zombie.  \\"La Sexorcisto\\" is probably my second favorite album of all time: there is not one weak track on that album.   Astro Creep 2000 was a solid follow up, although it was much more synth-oriented. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time with this solo crap...get La Sexorcisto & AC2000 from WZ from White Zombie...
0684800713|5.0|The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway is a great novel that describes the life of Jake Barnes.  Jake was a soldier in World War One and is now living out the rest of his life in France and Spain.  Hemingway wrote this book as a critique on the lives of people in post World War One society.  He describes the lives of the Lost Generation, those who fought and lived through the horrors of World War One.  This review describes the background for The Sun Also Rises, summarizes the main points, and discusses the overall effect The Sun Also Rises has. <br /> <br />        Hemingway wrote this book between 1924 and 1926, a few years after World War One ended.  Many World War One Veterans came back from the war disillusioned.  Life lost most of its purpose for the veterans after seeing so many die in such a brutal fashion.  Hemingway is commenting on how World War One changed these people's lives for the worse.  He does this through describing the lives of Jake and his friends. <br /> <br />        The book opens with Jake and his friends living their lives like normal.  They are writers living in Paris.  Jake says, \\"Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself.  Braddocks was his literary friend\\" (5).  Then Robert, Jake, and their friends Mike, Bill, and Brett travel to Pamplona, Spain to join in the fiesta of San Fermin.  During the fiesta things start to go wrong for the friends.  Everyone is drinking nonstop and this makes disagreements come to the front.  Brett and Mike are engaged to be married but Robert Cohn wants to marry Brett, this conflict ends in a fight between Robert, Jake, and Mike.  This happened during an argument, Jake describes, \\"I swung at him and he ducked.  I saw his face duck sideways in the light.  He hit me\\" (191).  Near the end Brett ends up running off with a bullfighter named Pedro Romero.  However, there is still more to the story in which you will have to read to find out how it ends. <br /> <br />        This book does an excellent job of getting the point across that Hemingway was trying to convey.  Hemingway does an amazing job of showing how terrible life is for the Lost Generation.  The war has completely ruined Jake's life.  Jake and Brett both love each other; however they cannot be together because of a war wound Jake received.  At the end Brett says, \\"Oh, Jake, we could have had such a damned good time together\\" (247).  Had Jake not been injured in the war he could have lived a happy life with Brett.  Instead he just passes the time, either drunk or alone.  After the fiesta of San Fermin, Jake went off by himself.  He did not wish to stay with his friends. Instead his philosophy was \\"If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money.  I spent a little money and the waiter liked me\\" (233).  He did not need true friends; people who were nice to him were all he wanted.  Life had no purpose for Jake; he was just letting the days pass him by. <br /> <br />        Ernest Hemingway's book The Sun Also Rises is set in the decade after World War One, describes Jake's life, and does a great job of critiquing the lives of the Lost Generation.  This is a great book that everyone should read.  It does a good job of describing the impacts of war on the soldiers.  This is definitely one of Hemingway's best novels and deserves to be read and remembered for years to come. <br />

You're an idiot!  This album is pure genious!  Give it a chance, and you'll love it!  It took me many, many listenings, and I now consider this one of my few 'desert island' musical selections. <br /> <br />Quirky.  Complex.  Stupid.  Intelligent.  Have you ever sucked stale, cold coffee from a crappy paper napkin?  Probably not.  For better or worse, this album is the musical equivalent, however.  I'm not sure what that means, but if you listen to 'Trout Mask Replica' you'll get the very same sensation. <br /> <br />And you'll like it!
0679601686|5.0|If this book needs a recommendation, it would be that it has been delighting readers for almost 200 years.  In Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Austen has created the quintessential spunky heroine who refuses to let her somewhat low position on the social ladder dictate her behavior.  Her mother is determined to marry off her five daughters to the highest bidders, but Elizabeth refuses to look for a marriage of financial convenience.  She is hopeful that her sister Jane will marry the amiable Mr. Bingley, but she has no real matrimonial ambitions for herself.  She has a particular disdain for Mr. Darcy, from which comes the \\"prejudice\\" of the title.  He is a prideful man, thus supplying the other half of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  The language of the book is, of course, quite different from modern-day phraseology, but it's worth plowing through the conversations of manners and morals to uncover the delightful story of this star-crossed duo.  May it continue to delight readers for the next 200 years!

1881273156|5.0|Okay, first things first.  I am in a relationship (and it's going great), not married, and I was not very interested in reading this book at first.  After reading it with my girlfriend, however, I now must say that I am hooked on the five love languages.<br /><br />Chapman's thesis is that people express their love to each other in five different ways.  Depending on how they were raised/their natural nature, people seem to prefer expressing love (and having love expressed to them) in five different ways:<br /><br />1. Words of affirmation (can include written words)<br /><br />2. Quality time (NOT watching movies)<br /><br />3. Gifts  (not necessarily expensive)<br /><br />4. Acts of service (house chores, doing services)<br /><br />5. Physical touch (not necessarily sex)<br /><br />Chapman's keys to success are easy: figure out what your partner/spouse's love language is, \\"speak\\" that language to them, and give them opportunities to speak your love language back to you.<br /><br />Here are some good things about The 5LL:  after reading it with my girlfriend, I found that it has worked for me.  I know how to better express love to her and she to me.  We both feel like our relationship is stronger.  I also enjoy how Chapman points out that the love languages can also be applied to friends - one close friend of mine prefers gifts, and I know how to express my appreciation to them.<br /><br />Now, The 5LL will certainly face its share of criticism.  Because the message is so simple, I feel the book is a little repetitive.  After awhile, I became tired of reading phrases like \\"emotional love tank\\" too much, and I felt Chapman repeated himself or overexplained himself too much.  I also think readers might want to take the helpful quiz at the back of the book before starting to determine their love language.<br /><br />I think the overwhelming majority of people will find this book to be helpful in their lives, and I am glad I read it.
B00005JO20|4.0|If you missed King Kong at the theaters, here's your chance to catch up. Peter Jackson's version is easily the best of the three Kong epics. The film (DVD) begins slowly, builds up with furious action in the second act and concludes with a breathtaking finale. It feels like three seperate films, but somehow works as a singular vision. The acting is first rate and nearly matches the intensity of the action. King Kong doesn't quite reach the unmatched level of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's close enough to guarantee the viewer an exciting evening of escapist entertainment.<br /><br />King Kong is divided into three distinct parts (acts). The first act focuses on the characters' back-story. And while Jackson has done this before (the flawless first half of The Fellowship of the Ring), his effort here is slightly erratic: too many ideas, not enough precision. Twenty minutes of editing would have served the film well. It is here we are introduced to Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts). Ms. Watts is brilliant. Sure, you'll remember Kong, the special effects and the deluge of action, but it is Ann Darrow who will steal your heart. Naomi Watts is tops among the new crew of beauties who can act (Jennifer Connelly, Charlize Theron, Angelina Jolie etc.). Jack Black, Adrien Brody and the rest of the cast shine in performances that have somehow been overlooked (Lord of the Rings backlash?).<br /><br />The second act takes place on Skull Island. The action here is ripping throughout and one will find it hard to breathe during some of the spectacular sequences. There are dinosaurs,hostile natives, scary bugs and Kong's introduction during this section. There is also action, jaw dropping special effects, beauty in abundance and still more action during this sixty minute roller coaster ride. The DVD is worth owning for the second act alone.<br /><br />The final act gives the film(DVD) and its audience a chance to breathe. It focuses on men and their greed/ignorance, the Technicolor brilliance of NYC at night and the events that lead to King Kong's inevitable doom. The final act is where humanity and technology intersect. Watts says more with her expressive blue eyes than the lines she is given. Kong-- in a real triumph for special effects-- matches her emotions with the sadness conveyed in his CGI brown eyes. By the time the planes zoom in and reduce The Mighty King Kong in both size and relevance (incredible cinematography) as he is perched precariously on the Empire State buiding, the audience is ready for the end of the film. Sure, three hours is long time to wait for a predictable ending...but it's worth it.illiance of NYC at night and the events that lead to King Kong's inevitable doom.

B000E97HIA|5.0|Been a prince fan for years.  Always apprieciated everything Prince has done.  From the great \\"Purple Rain\\" to now.  But this CD brings back music, band, and intruments.  While most of everyone is hooked on Pre-packaged POP, RAP, R&B, Corporate garbage, Prince still does what he always has done, PLAY MUSIC!  With disregard to reviews, and public opinion.  This CD just reminds me of the classic FUNK, BANDS THAT PLAYED FOR THE FEEL OF GREAT SOUND.  If you are a fan of Prince this album will draw you back in why Prince was the KING of the 80s, and why he continues to influence artists today!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I seem to be one of a very few \\"Original\\" Star Wars fans who not only approves but applauds the additions Lucas made to his classic films, and I was also pleased to find the DVD release to consist only of the special edition, rather than bowing to the no doubt enraged orginal fans who wanted the orignal theatrical cuts. George Lucas made a brave move, going back and \\"retro fitting\\" the orignal movies so they where at least closer to what he originally wanted, and I'm glad to see he didn't try to backtrack by pleasing both camps. <br /> <br />Reviewing these films seems pointless as they have become so much a part of culture (wether you realize it or not) that you have no excuse for not seeing them. And if somehow you did miss them, now is your chance to see what you missed. <br /> <br />The Trilogy absolutely shines on DVD (and I can finally through out my old VHS copies) and belongs on the shelf of every fan of Star Wars, Science Fiction, or Cinema. <br />
6305252521|5.0|With its (all intentional of course) cheerfully colorful cinematography, cheesy music and one-dimensional supporting characters, it's easy to miss just how brilliant The Truman Show is; it's in fact one of the most important cinematic creations of the 1990's, at least as important as darker films like American History X and Fight Club, and one that works on several different levels. Because while it works quite clearly as a sarcastic satire and a commentary on the destructive and intrusive nature of the media in the post-modern age, in the light of the reality TV syndrome which was at the time just starting to grow, it's also a philosophical metaphor about the state of mankind. <br /> <br />For Truman's story is man's story; and it's difficult not to see the importance in the names given to the lead characters. True Man's life, the film says, is an illusion, a lie. Or perhaps - all our lives are illusions, but the True Man is the one who figures it out and seeks a deeper truth. In its essence the point is very similar to the one The Matrix made; The Truman Show is a fascinating trip through Plato's Cave, and while it takes a rather simplistic look at Plato's philosophy - because any other way would be impossible in a film of less than two hours - it doesn't dumb it down. The Truman Show is a deep and intricate film that deserves repeated viewing and gets better with time, and can be discussed for hours. <br /> <br />Writer Andrew Niccol - who made his breakthrough debut one year before with the critically acclaimed cult favorite Gattaca - lost the Oscar that year to the Academy's favorite Shakespeare In Love, and director Peter Weir got most of the credit for the film; but while it's certainly an important achievement for Weir and the best film of his long career, it's Niccol's sarcastic, intelligent, innovative script that made The Truman Show great; that, and the amazing performance by Jim Carrey, who showed his fantastic dramatic skills here for the first time. Carrey is enchanting in the lead role as the ultimate everyman Truman, and we're as fascinated with him as the show's fans in the film. Praise should also go to Ed Harris, who plays Christof, creator and director of The Truman Show (and again, special attention should be given to the character's name) - and also to Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natasha McElhone, Harry Shearer, Peter Krause, Paul Giamatti and the rest of the wonderful supporting cast, both in Truman's world of Seahavan and in Christof's `real' world. Finally, a word of praise for the excellent musical score, composed by Burkhard von Dallwitz and the great Philip Glass, which compliments the film's atmosphere to perfection. <br /> <br />The Truman Show is not an easy movie to absorb; it's a disturbing tale and a disturbing message, which takes some time to seep in, and while it's entirely unconvincing as a reality and even as sci-fi, and feels more like a metaphor than a story of a specific man, it's also entirely involving and demands to be taken at face value. Truman's character is irresistibly charming, and just like the people watching The Truman Show, we believe in him and identify with him completely. The beauty of The Truman Show is that it's lots of fun; it proves that entertainment and art are not necessarily opposing ideals. By being entirely entertaining and gripping, it gets its messages across a whole lot better. <br /> <br />The Truman Show is now eight years old: the way I see it, once a decade has passed, a film can begin to be considered a classic. The Truman Show will pass that test. In any possible aspect, The Truman Show is one of the absolute best films of the 90's, and one that will remain relevant long after reality TV has bitten the dust.
B000002GQH|5.0|I can't say much more than what the others have said except that The Moody Blues \\"On the Threshold of a Dream\\" is my all time favorite rock album, bar none.  It is simply brilliant, a stunning work of art, that stands up perfectly to this day.  I recommend listening to this late at night when you're all alone.  It's an album that must be experienced quietly, peacefully, with headphones if possible, so that none of the multi-layered nuances will be missed.  The Moody Blues created a style all their own, and this album represents the band at the pinnacle of their creativity, although Days of Future Passed certainly comes close.  \\"On the Threshold of a Dream\\" is a journey that will take you where you've never been, and bring you back all the better for it.Their original albums are being reissued as super audio cd's, with bonus tracks.  While you must have the proper equipment to experience the SACD aspect, they will also play on standard players.
B000E97Y6K|1.0|Some would like to suggest that Peter Jackson is like the second coming of George Lucas, back in his hey-days. However, I feel that he has more in common with P.T. Barnum. I've never felt more underwhelmed nor emotionally cheated as I did watching King Kong. I couldn't wait to see it, and while I loathed the later two LOTR films, I had faith that Jackson could bring together a more concentrated effort here. But when I was sitting in the theater and it got to New York (by then I was already well disgruntled with the movie) and Anne walks in fashion model slow-mo with a bright, heavenly light behind her, up to a dazzled Kong... I just had to look around and see if anyone else was buying this crap.  <br /> <br />The story itself, while fundementally the same as its 1930's counterpart, mind bogglingly meanders with the utmost tedium through in-jokes, stale dialogue, and a myriad of disjointed scenes that never seem to amount to anything. It's almost ironic that the 1930's film, while exceptionally shorter, seems to, at once, cover more territory and allow for more character developement. It's not that Jackson's Kong doesn't have plenty of character developement, its that it is so erroniously out of place that I never ended up caring for the supposed main characters.  <br /> <br />And sure, the special effects were fine and dandy, they were an eye sore of technical achievement. So much so that I could hardly see a damn thing sometimes, especially in the fights and in the wide shots. When Kong and the V. Rex are fighting, I could, at best, make out fur, scales, and noise. The camera was so close, that it wasn't intense, it was nauseating. And I won't go off on how utterly silly Kong acts through out the film. He may be a giant monkey, but that doesn't mean he has to act like a three year old. I was expecting a sympathetic character, a creature with a respectable sense of age and weight. Instead he's pathetic, more like a pea brained child than a 30 ft. tall super mammal.<br /> <br />This is the Hollywood formula at it's finest. It's got great production values, expensive effects, big name actors, a big name property, clean cinematography, and no soul. I see people all the time just getting dazzled and suckered in by Hollywood's glossy veil that they can't see that there's nothing behind it. This film is nothing but an excercise in excess and incompetence, and as such, that it has seen such momentus sucess suggests that Barnum was right about suckers. I would also hazard a guess that everyone one of them was born here, in the US.
1400079179|1.0|This book is poorly written. There is nothing here but a bad copy of Robert Ludlum's writing style and a feeble attempt to popularize Freemasonry. The only reason for the hype surrounding this book is that it attacks Christianity and Catholic church. As a computer security expert, I find cryptographic references in the book laughable.
0060925000|5.0|This sprawling historical novel is magnificent.  Looking for a summer book?  This is the one.  It is somewhat reminiscent of the  Raj Quartet which was also set in India, and equally sprawling, but with another plot line and slightly different time line  The rhythm of this book hinges on cycles, balance, and duality:  Hindu and Muslim, Pakistan and India, rich and poor, male and female, young and old, religious and secular, life and death, etc.  The book is believable and manges to be quit educational in a most enjoyable way.  For those of us in the West it is a history lesson that should not be missed.  It offers insight into a critical region of the world and to India which continues to emerge as a force to be reckoned with in the global scene.<br /><br />I have been told by friends that to those of us in the United States that there is no place in the world that seems so \\"foreign\\" as India.  So completely different from our experience, and a land of glaring contrasts to our eyes.  I  can assure you that this is a book I would recommend to anyone who planned on traveling to India as the place to start in learning about the land, peoples, history, and culture.<br /><br />Here in the West we are suspicious of the idea of \\"arranged marriages\\" and prefer the haphazard, and hazardous, route of \\"romantic\\" love with that one special person.  This book helped me realize that perhaps here in the U. S. we have become too complacent about something so important as  marriage (not only to the individuals but the family and ultimately society as well) and there is much to be said for a culture which puts such effort in finding a suitable match rather than leaving it to chance.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned if Vikram Seth never writes another word he has established himself as a great writer.  This book truly awed me with its maturity, and depth.

B000002C25|5.0|First of all, Oasis isn't (or wasn't) the greatest band in the world. The music that Oasis produced during the 90's was mostly great, but they werent that influential like a dozen of other bands before them. But who cares anyway. It's no competition, is it? Besides, there's no sense in comparing bands that had their glorydays through different decades. <br /> <br />When Oasis arrived they made a whole generation of young kids believe they were actualy the greatest band on earth. Fair enough, but in that case you can expect some critics who'll sharpen their knives and cannot wait to get your ass as soon as you put out an album that cannot live up the hype. <br /> <br />And that's waht happened after the release of Be Here Now. Oasis always said (if not shouted) they were the biggest, the best etc. But when you say that you must be better that the allknown best popband of alltime (and also most influental) The Beatles. A Band who not only created a lot of original popgems but also re-invented themselves and therefore were a major influence on popmusic in general. <br /> <br />Oasis has always been a simple (but pure) rock 'n roll band who were also influenced by the beatles. But then again, they let the experiments to other bands like Radiohead.  <br />In the summer of 97 veryone was expecting the greatest album of all time: Be Here Now would be thier own Masterpiece. Just as Revolver or Sgt Pepper were the truly masterpieces of the Beatles. <br />But whereas those albums were totally something different to their predecessors, Be Here Now was more or less the same like Morning Glory and Defenitely Maybe. Big hooks, simple guitar parts, ridiculous lyrics and smartass pop melodies. But this time everything was blown up to high proportions. Oasis were doing a a lot of coke those days and so it shows. The self-indulgence and arrogance are all over the place. Coke makes you feel the most important person in the world, but also makes you feel good. <br /> <br />And that's what's this album is about: long, epical feelgood popsongs. They couldnt be arsed like inventing the wheel, they just wanted to create anthems to make people feel good at.  <br />For me they succeeded. Even I know those songs are too long, the lyrics dont say much about my personal life. But still, I can enjoy listening to Be Here Now still as much as I did when I was young and excited waitingaa whole damn summer for this album. <br /> <br />After all Oasis DID release an album that is unique. I've never heard any other (britpop)album that is as pompeous like this.  <br />And Oasis has never released anything like this again, as Noel 'hates'it now. Therefore its a perfect end to a great era of the 'old oasis' (94-97). <br /> <br />The music may be cheeky in bits, and yes you just cant listen to it everyday...but after all this album is just as enjoyable as any other classic. Don't compare it with Revolver Led Zeppelin  4 or Let It Bleed. Just take it as a overblown coked rockalbum full of confidence, swagger and joy.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0743454537|5.0|When I first heard the title, I didn't think that it was a book that I was going to like. I mean, it seemed boring to listen to a girl complain about how she doesn't want to help her sister and save her life by donating a kidney. But as I got more into the book, I realized that this WAS a book that I was going to enjoy. I really liked how it brought the lives of not only the main characters, but also other characters by swithing the point of veiw and font of the text. <br /> The book really evoked many emotions. The biggist emotion for me was sadness. It seemed like Anna's family only wanted her because she was saving her sister, Kate's, life. But after she filed a lawsuit, they all began to realize that they really did love Anna and that it was great having her around. The ending of the book really shocked me though. Overall, this is one of the best boks that I have ever gotten to read.

0684824906|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br /><br />It is, essentially, the story of five men: Lincoln and four of his political rivals, three of whom in 1860 were expected to have a better chance than Lincoln of being elected president.  All five men were exceptionally intelligent, successful, and proud.  All but Lincoln were well-educated, and they all considered themselves superior to Lincoln---at first.  But he was, of course, elected and he then surprised everyone by choosing these four proud, strong rivals to serve in his most critical cabinet positions, at a crucial historical moment.<br /><br />Three of the four soon came to love Lincoln and respect him and acknowledge him as the greatest of them all.  Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase never came to that understanding and always thought that he should have been president.  Attorney General Edward Bates, though, came to believe that Lincoln was a nearly perfect leader.  Secretary of War Edwin Stanton developed a fierce loyalty to Lincoln and cried for weeks after Lincoln's assassination.  And Secretary of State William H. Seward became Lincoln's closest friend and strongest ally in the government.<br /><br />It is remarkable that Lincoln was able to attract these outstanding and disparate talents to his administration, and a testament to his unrivalled political genius that he was able to hold them together as an effective team through the dark and complex years of the Civil War.<br /><br />Read this book and you'll probably learn a good bit more than you already know about these five men.  One has to wonder how the Civil War would have played out and how the country would have fared if one of these other men had won the presidency in 1860.  Perhaps you'll conclude, as I have, that the country was extraordinarily fortunate that Lincoln was elected; that Seward might well have been a very good president; that Bates would have been at best an average president; that Stanton, despite his brilliance, would have been a harsh and ultimately ineffective president; and that Chase's unfortunate personality would have alienated everyone, despite his many talents, and that he would have failed miserably as president.<br /><br />If you're a person who loves to pull up a chair and read a long and fascinatingly detailed history of great men and political intrigues of a bygone era, if you're open to the possibility that there is much to be learned even today from Lincoln's political genius, then this is the book for you.been a harsh and ultimately ineffective president; and that Chase's unfortunate personality would have alienated everyone, despite his many talents, and that he would have failed miserably as president. <br /> <br />If you're a person who loves to pull up a chair and read a long and fascinatingly detailed history of great men and political intrigues of a bygone era, if you're open to the possibility that there is much to be learned even today from Lincoln's political genius, then this is the book for you. <br />
B000E33VWW|4.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman (upcoming Mission: Impossible 3, Flawless) plays of course Author Truman Capote, in which Hoffman one the Best Actor award. Capote takes upon a case involving two convicted killers in 1958, Perry Smith played by Clifton Collins, Jr. (Dirty, Tigerland) and Richard Hickock played by Mark Pellegrino (Mulholland Dr., The Hunted). Capote decides he's going to write a book on the 2 and how they actually killed the people and so forth. He spends time with Perry Smith a lot getting to know him, getting to know all about what happened and build on his novel which he says will be a phenomenon. The book is called \\"In Cold Blood\\" which I havent read yet which I heard it really good by most people who have read it and I didnt even see the movie with Robert Blake (I should get on this stuff huh?). Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers possibly his best performance so far in his career, I mean dont get me wrong this guy is good in a lot of stuff he is in but this one shows his depth and how far he went as we see on the screen as he transformed himself into Capote. Cathering Keener (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Being John Malkovich) is great as novelist and friend to Capote, Harper Lee who wrote To Kill A Mockinbird. Chris Cooper (Syriana, American Beauty) in another splendid supporting role. Clifton Collins, Jr. is superb here too playing Perry. Also starring Bruce Greenwood (Double Jeopardy, Hollywood Homicide), Bob Balaban (Gosford Park, Best In Show), Allie Mickelson (The 5 People You Meet In Heaven), Marshall Bell (Starship Troopers, Idenity) and Amy Ryan (War of the Worlds, In The Deep Woods). Surely one of 2005's best movies
1558908846|2.0|One of my guilty pleasures is to review science fiction movies over and over again...Maybe I'm hoping the movie will get better with time. Unfortunately \\"Judge Dredd\\"  does not! I'm a science fiction fan that can be suckered by mediocre CGI , an action hero star, a comic relief, and a beautiful love interest but please don't mess with the storyline. Maybe thiis is the case for \\"Future Shock\\" and too much information was being given out but all in all science fiction deals with the person's humanity and  \\"Dredd\\" forces it down our throats too fast and too sugary....In fact , I feel two stars is gviing this movie too much!
B000E5N62U|5.0|Okay, I'm gonna put it right on the line. I'm 19 years old, and I never really got into Steely Dan (I remember getting mad when they beat Radiohead for the album of the year grammy in 2001), however I've been interested in Fagen's solo material ever since I heard \\"True Companion\\" from the Heavy Metal soundtrack, which has a guitar solo that reminds me of Pink Floyd's \\"Have A Cigar\\". I bought this CD at Target today, along with David Gilmour's \\"On An Island\\", and Morph The Cat is a great album! The only track I needed to skip was track 4 (Brite Nitegown), but the rest of the album is great! I hope to check out his other solo material soon, starting with \\"The Nightfly\\", and then moving up from there. One of the best albums to come out this year. Check it out!

The action scenes by both Mr. Sylvestor Stallone and Mr. Wesley Snipes (pre-BLADE)? The comedy sparsely yet satisfyingly set in the story? The romantic interest portrayed by a young Sandra Bullock (Sandra you look MARVELOUS!)? I guess it has to be all the above! Oh and the plot line has a nice twisty curvy touch to it! One last note who couldn't fall for a thawed action hero who can knit!

1860498825|5.0|The first night I began this journey, I did not sleep until my eyelids were physically unable to stay open. The next day for the first time in my life I wished for a longer commute just so I could read for a little bit longer.  At lunchtime, I tiptoed away from my work, and was not seen until close to late afternoon when I tiptoed sheepishly back in.  Ms. Waters weaves an enchantment about her readers, quite stealing away their attentions from all else as her beguiling heroines steal each others hearts. Fingersmith, like its predecessor, Tipping the Velvet, empowers while it entertains with fiery celebration of two women in love. Set in gothic Victorian England in 1860's, complete with a crumbling house and withering vegetation, a thief-come-maid sets off from London with a twisted dark mission; to steal her lady's fortune. However, like all good tales, naught is what it seems at the beginning.  Without giving away too much of the plot, much \\"hangs\\" upon Water's tapestry of motives and team of characters. Its narrative style teases readers with some artful foreshadowing, while irony gives Fingersmith some refreshing humor. The suspense is much more articulate in this work than Ms. Water's debut. To boot, I have never read a more satisfying ending, much like a robust finish found in a fine vintage of wine. Though Fingersmith is no high literary art, it's thoroughly captivating reading, and much needed quality lesbian fiction and romance.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Let me warn you before you start reading, I just discovered my love for Megadeth, and thrash metal in general, during the past 2 years, so I haven't heard the original Rust In Peace.<br /><br />What I do know, however, is that if what other reviewers say about the original is true, then it must be the best thrash album out there, because I love my copy of the remaster like a teddy bear. I take it with me in the car. It comes with me on vacation. Hell, I've slept with it under my pillow before.<br /><br />When I first bought this I thought it was very overrated, but it didn't take me more than a month of listening to it before it became my best friend. Holy Wars is amazing. Hangar 18 is one of best thrash songs ever recorded. Can you say SOLO BATTLE? Friedman and Mustaine take turns soloing for about 4 minutes. Let's not forget the opening riff either. Hangar 18 is one of those songs that makes me want to throw rocks at a school bus. It is IMPOSSIBLE to keep from banging your head while listening to this album. Every song, even the somewhat funny Dawn Patrol, is 100/10. The bonus tracks, as I've found is a common theme with the remasters, aren't worth much. Basically they're different versions of Holy Wars, Rust In Peace, Take No Prisoners, and then a new song that Menza wrote most of.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Arguably the greatest thrash album ever made, the best Megadeth album out there, the first two tracks should be enough of a motive for you to buy this RIGHT NOW.
043939483X|5.0|My son, who is now 21 months ond, has been loving this book since he was an infant.  At around 10 months he began crawling to the book basket in our living room several times a day looking for this book, and we still read it many times a week.  It is beginning to be a favorite of our 6 month old as well!!!
B000AMJDHY|1.0|I'd like to think over the years that I have matured. Most of the alt. metal/rap-rock groups that plagued me throughout HS/early college have all but fallen by the wayside. Since those days are past me, I really haven't felt the need to write a scathing one star review for anything... <br /> <br />...till now. <br /> <br />I'll avoid the details since my fellow one star reviewers pretty much hit ever last nail, sealing the coffin. I'd just like to leave Panic!'s fans with this one thought in mind: 2 years from now, are you still gonna be listening to this spit?
0440180295|4.0|Billy Pilgrim is born in 1922 and grows up in Ilium, New York. He does pretty good in high school, and enrolls in night classes at the Ilium School of Optometry, and is drafted into the army during World War II. He trains as a chaplain's helper in South Carolina, where an umpire officiates during practice battles and announces who survives and who dies. Billy's father dies in a hunting accident shortly before Billy ships overseas to join an infantry regiment in Luxembourg. Billy is thrown into the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium and is immediately taken prisoner behind German lines. Just before his capture, he experiences his first incident of time shifting. He sees the entirety of his life, from beginning to end, in one sweep. <br /> Billy is transported in a crowded railway boxcar to a POW camp in Germany. Upon his arrival, he and the other privates are treated to a feast by a group of fellow prisoners, who are English officers who were captured earlier in the war. Billy suffers a breakdown and gets a shot of morphine that sends him time-tripping again. Soon he and the other Americans travel onward to the beautiful city of Dresden, still fairly untouched by wartime privation. Here the prisoners must work for their keep at various jobs, including the creation of a nutritional malt syrup. Their camp is where a former slaughterhouse used to be. One night, Allied forces carpet bomb the city, then drop incendiary bombs to create a firestorm that sucks most of the oxygen into the fire, killing or burning roughly 130,000 people. Billy and his fellow POWs survive in an airtight meat locker. They emerge to find a land of destruction, where they are forced to move corpses from the rubble. Several days later, Russian forces capture the city, and Billy's involvement in the war ends. <br /> Billy returns to Ilium and finishes optometry school. He gets engaged to Valencia Merble, the obese daughter of the school's founder. After a nervous breakdown, Billy commits himself to a veterans' hospital and receives shock treatments. During his stay in the mental ward, a fellow patient introduces Billy to the science fiction novels of a writer named Kilgore Trout. After his recovery, Billy gets married. His wealthy father-in-law sets him up in the optometry business, and Billy and Valencia raise two children and grow rich. At his eighteenth wedding anniversary party the sight of a barbershop quartet makes him break down because, he realizes, it triggers a memory of Dresden. <br /> The night after his daughter's wedding in 1967, as he later reveals on a radio talk show, Billy is kidnapped by two-foot-high aliens who resemble upside-down toilet plungers, who he says are called Tralfamadorians. They take him in their flying saucer to the planet Tralfamadore, where they mate him with a movie actress named Montana Wildhack. She, like Billy, has been brought from Earth to live under a transparent geodesic dome in a zoo where Tralfamadorians can observe extraterrestrial curiosities. The Tralfamadorians explain to Billy their perception of time, how its entire sweep exists for them simultaneously in the fourth dimension. When someone dies, that person is simply dead at a particular time. Somewhere else and at a different time he or she is alive and well. Tralfamadorians prefer to look at life's nicer moments. <br /> When he returns to Earth, Billy initially says nothing of his experiences. In 1968, he gets on a chartered plane to go to an optometry conference in Montreal. The plane crashes into a mountain, and, among the optometrists, only Billy survives. A brain surgeon operates on him in a Vermont hospital. On her way to visit him there, Valencia dies of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning after crashing her car. Billy's daughter places him under the care of a nurse back home in Ilium. But he feels that the time is ripe to tell the world what he has learned. Billy has foreseen this moment while time-tripping, and he knows that his message will eventually be accepted. He sneaks off to New York City, where he goes on a radio talk show. Shortly thereafter, he writes a letter to the local paper. His daughter is at her wit's end and does not know what to do with him. Billy makes a tape recording of his account of his death, which he predicts will occur in 1976 after Chicago has been hydrogen-bombed by the Chinese. He knows exactly how it will happen. An unforgiving man he knew in the war will hire someone to shoot him. Billy adds that he will experience the violet hum of death and then will skip back to some other point in his life. He has seen it all many times. <br />
B000A0GP4K|2.0|This is a long documentary from a vastly over rated director that only covers the initial discovery of a rising star. The pic is good in that it shows how Dylan evolves his music from a amateur Woody Guthrie imitation to polished professional, discovering in himself a talent for word play, a fixation with a certain rough edge sound and a desire to express his music only the way he likes.<br /><br />But it covers only the first decade and a half of his long career, which for youngsters like me - for whom his lexigraphy is already firmly entrenched in legend - omits the musically better, albeit not most influential, portion of his career. It stops in 1966.<br /><br />When I grew up, Dylan's folk tunes were already the wisdom of the ages: Springsteen was hailed as the new poet for my generation. Yet this was the time Dylan was producing his complete work. It was the 70s when he produced \\"epigrams of surrealistic poetry and emotional intrigue\\" blended with a blues band. These are the gems that shine today as the best selling Dylan albums of all time.<br /><br />There is not much on this pic about his family (did he have brothers? Did he involve them in his career? Did he buy Mom a Cadillac?). There is little about Joan Baez, her obviously awesome talent, or his other loves. There is little about how well the songs did on the pop charts, then or now.<br /><br />Ray, De-Lovely, All That Jazz and Walk the Line are all full Hollywood musical bio-pics that impact not only the joy of the music, but also the character of the artist and the flavor of the times. Sadly, this one does not.
B000BB1MHS|4.0|A pallid Willie Wonka (Johnny Depp) is an androgynous eccentric chocholateer who, with the help of Oompa Loompas (Deep Roy), is simultaneously teaching moral lessons in excess and respect to five children (and their mentors) while learning the same himself from an underprivileged little boy named Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore). The many choreographic technical masterpieces are appreciated even more after viewing the detailed behind-the-scenes bonus features on the DVD. Charlie is a stark contrast to outre characters with equally outlandish sets comprising the bulk of the movie. Children will find delight in the characters. Adults may highlight the morality while enjoying some of the tongue-in-cheek humor. As someone aptly said, this movie is literal eye candy for the family.<br /><br />Movie quote: \\"There's plenty of money out there. They print more of it every day. But that ticket? There are only five of them in the world, and that's all there's ever going to be. Only a dummy would give this up for something as common as money. Are you a dummy?\\"
B000E97Y6K|5.0|First off I want to say that this film is just amazing. I have seen it in Theaters twice when it came out so I was very happy when the DVD came out. The special effects are the best I have seen, I mean come on just look at it, and for all that might not know CG Effects like the ones they did for the film it is very hard to make it look great in daylight and in the film lots of effects are in daylight and they just looked great.  The rest of the extra stuff on the DVD is great! And will keep you interested for a long time, so if you don't have the DVD go and get it, the movie is for all ages and it will keep you glued to your TV set for a long time. Other things you should look out for that is coming out on DVD and Cd is The Vines- Vision Valley 4-4-06, Tool- 10,000 days 5-2-06 and for DVD Brokeback Mountain 4-4-06 and also Check out V for Vendetta in theaters now, that was an amazing movie!
B000025SL5|5.0|I am really picky when it comes to soundtracks. Vangelis is one example of me being really fussy. I'm am not a real big fan of his work (chariots of fire to be example - it stole the academy award of john williams for indiana jones) however i do not disregard his work.  <br /> <br />I first perked an interest into his work when watching alexander. I later found my way to 1492 conquest of paradise. I made my choice based on reviews that held high praise of this work. Which i agree. <br /> <br />I can not notice that 1492 and alexander sound so similar despite being different pieces of work (one being less synthetic than the other). <br /> <br />The 2nd track is the highlight. If you closely listen it sounds very similar to track 12 or 13 of alexander (across the mountains). Same tune for the voices but it is more varied in Alexander.  <br /> <br />Track 3 monastry of rabida is another excellent piece, i personally think it sounds similar to a cirque dis solei soundtrack when it reaches the end. <br /> <br />The use of the choir is of high standard (except track 5, light and dark, tracks 9 and 10).  <br /> <br />The use of synthesisers may annoy some people but track 8  (eternity - will make you think otherwise, once you pass the annoying start) <br /> <br />i also am not a real fan of 'new age' music, but vangelis makes it an exceptional listen. Highly recommended for those who want a powerful listening experience.
B000002P5W|5.0|The best CD from the greatest guitarist who ever lived. Shame on you if you don't own it.
B000055ZDT|4.0|This stoned out sludge band is far from uncreative. Their lyrics are something straight out of H.P Lovecraft and one of his novels, while the music feeds on a mid 90's stoner sound. The music itself is something very unrefined to say the least, but gives Electric Wizard a unique feel.  This album will not be a disappointment for any fans of Atomic Bitchwax or even Monster Magnet, but is much more unrefined.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|O.k., so I am one of those people that believe that the first third of the movie was a bit slow, and brought in unnecessary elements into the story line. But rest assured, once the monkey shows up, \\"It's Showtime, Folks!\\". The CGI in this film is staggering, especially where Kong is concerned. I was riveted on him from the first moment he shows himself, until the bitter end. For all intents and purposes, watching Kong in this movie is a virtual study in low land gorilla behavior and mannerisms. So real is this creature that you actually find yourself in his corner emotionally, throughout the film. There's a connection with Kong that none of the preceding \\"King Kong\\" movies could even come close to rivaling. And strangely, this is the first \\"Kong\\" movie that I didn't fall in love with the female lead, and perhaps for no other reason than the fact that she's pretty much been upstaged by her 25 ft. CGI co-star,.....he was THAT good!! <br />There were some parts of the film that seemed inserted purely to be a promo for the King Kong video game that followed the theater release, but even that didn't dampen my anticipation for my next peek at the ape. You also won't find any radical twists in the same old story line followed by its predecessors, but again, Kong is such a visual treat, you won't mind. <br />So sit back and enjoy! It may just be the only time you ever fall in love with a monkey.
B000005IU2|5.0|I'd give this album 100 stars if I could. It not one of the best, or maybe the best, it's THE BEST by a mile, by many miles.
B000E97HIA|5.0|I give it five stars: it's not perfect, but it's so good it still deserves top grade.  The packinging is indulgent - it's Prince after all! His home decor is, shall we say, a little on the \\"velvety\\" side, but at least he puts his lyrics next to all the pix. The \\"Willy Wonka gold ticket\\" on the wrapping is just plain cruel though - seven people get a chance to win the chance to see him play - at his house I guess. Needless to say, there was no ticket inside my copy. And: I spent $25 on signing up for membership on his NPG website - how dumb can you be, LOL. Annoying website, leading you through a maze of options: it gets real tired, real soon, Prince baby. But hey, like Madonna,  the guy's a marketing genious and normally I would stay far away, but I'm a sucker for Prince and thus will gladly cough up the dough. Looks wise, he's a little too \\"girly\\", but his music, oh, his music...    Twelve tracks:  Best one in my opinion is \\"The Word\\", both in terms of arrangement and lyrics and production. Starts with a beat, then synth strings, then a tenor sax, then his voice. So sexy, do dancable, so spiritual, so sublime it just hurts! The credits for that track: Prince. A one-man show.    Last track is just ridiculously infectious: \\"Get on the Boat\\". James Brown horns provided by among others, the legendary Maceo Parker of JB fame. And Sheila E. kicks some serious booty on the percussion.    \\"Dance\\" is beautiful, sexy, sad. He's just begging at the end, sounding like he's going crazy. No one does this better than Prince.    \\"Satisfied\\" is vintage Prince: falsetto, orgasmic. Yummy.    \\"Lolita\\" is seriously funky too - \\"you're sweeter, but you'll never make a cheater out of me\\". Sounds like Prince is happily married and is finally able to resist all those pretty young things tempting him.     \\"Beautiful, Loved and Blessed\\" with newcomer Tamar is not very exciting. I assume she is his latest protegee and a promo card for her debut album was inserted. Never heard of her before. She's good on backing vocals, but as a solo voice, she doen't stand out from so many other R&B singers. (Her looks: uncanny resemblance to Lauryn Hill.) I wish Prince would have asked Rosie Gaines to do vocals on this album:  NO ONE can sing like Rosie G.: Her vocals on \\"Diamond & Pearls\\" give me goosebumps every time I listen to it.    \\"Te Amo Corazon\\": what's up with all the Spanish, Prince? Trying to get your share of the exploding Latino market? Hmmm. This track is the dullest one - I usally skip it.     \\"Black Sweat\\": funky. Very very funky.    \\"Love\\", \\"Fury\\": allright, but they're not the ones I remembered best while writing this review. I'll have to go back and listen some more.    Opening track: \\"3121\\": This is his Hollyood Hills (above-the-Sunset-Strip) L.A. adress.  Funky, sexy: an invitation to a party.     Prince will be 48 on June 7 - he's Peter Pan, but in a good way! What would we do without him - there is so much junk coming out these days - he blows them all out of the water. And he doesn't look beyond scary like Keith Richards.    Sly Stone, Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, the Beatles, etc. : he's got 'em all in him, but he is Prince first and foremost.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|I won't rehash what most of the previous reviewers have said about this film, except to say some of them were right on target, and some of them totally missed the point. Remember, a \\"review\\" is, in the end, just one person's opinion. How can you review ANY film and expect everyone else to agree with that opinion? Answer....you simply can NOT! You can not decree that your likes or dislikes must be written in stone to which all others must adhere. That said, I'll share my reactions: <br /> <br />One reviewer wondered why Kong would favor Ann over the countless other \\"sacrifices\\" he'd been offered through the years? DUH!!! Think about it! All he'd had were \\"native\\" girls, year after year. Then one day, his \\"bride\\" turns up having blonde hair and blue eyes! And, eyes that actually looked BACK at him. Don't you think the other damsels were either drugged into oblivion, or, at least, prepared for the honor of being Kong's bride from generations of such tradition. Now, here comes some sober blue eyes with some fight to her. Kong is fascinated by this new \\"toy\\", and instead of ripping her head off like some spoiled child with a toy he's tired of, is delighted with a new favorite. Political correctness aside, Ann become Kong's pet. And, as our pets become a part of our family, so too does Ann become Kong's family. And, he will protect her to his death. I really can't believe that reviewer didn't get this. At any rate...... <br /> <br />I do agree the film is too long, but, it is still totally entertaining. I think too much time was spent in the jungle with too many showcases for too many creatures. Yes, the brontosaurus stampede was thrilling, but...was it crucial to the story? Yes, the insect pit, even deleted from the original Kong, was gripping, but...was it crucial to the story? Perhaps the only \\"creature feature\\" that WAS crucial to the story (as it is seen), would be the T-Rex sequence. And, this because Kong is protecting Ann from them, establishing even further how Kong would endanger himself to protect Ann from harm.  <br /> <br />I won't counter other points made in previous reviews, but I do have to concur with the majority of them in that the special effects are seamless, and absolutely wondrous. Jackson has made 30's New York City into a time-warp wonder! Exquisite work! As is Skull Island, both in front of, and behind, the wall. But, the true wonder of the entire film is Kong. The marriage of Andy Serkis' live action work, with CGI actually makes Kong a living creature, complete with expressions and personality. And, with Kong being such a real character, the interaction between him and Ann becomes as real as it would between any two \\"live\\" actors. Now, where Jackson's Kong soars way and beyond the original is here - there IS a relationship between them. In the original, Fay Wray spent the entire film trying to get away from Kong.....even in the final act. There was no \\"love\\" lost for her. In Jackson's version, Ann comes to really love Kong as he loves her. I am touched just thinking about Ann reaching out to caress Kong. What must Kong be thinking? Had any one or any thing ever literally touched him with love before? Had he LET any one or anything touch him before? Since words can not be empolyed, the bond between any \\"animal\\" and human is a profound one because it is based totally upon trust, compassion, and the unspoken communication of love. For me, I completely bought into the love between Ann and Kong, which made the end of the film heartwrenching for me. So, if the success of a film is measured by the degree it touches the viewer, this film hit the bullseye! It is truly THE best remake ever - far outdistancing itself from the original!!!
0452284392|5.0|In an informal survey held in a recent webinar, over 50% of the (several hundred) participants ranked \\"Word-of-Mouth\\" as the most typical source for leads that convert to paying customers.

B000002N2P|5.0|Never in my 28 years have I had a mohawk, gone sans shower for more than 48 hours, or worn a nail through my septum.  So maybe I'm not punk, but I can still enjoy this album for what it is, right?  Right. <br /> <br />Before the more \\"mature\\" Green Day released a republican-bashing rock opera, they wrote songs about meth heads, self-pity, being unpopular, and having a meltdown over nothing.  Maybe one of the most overlooked Green Day albums, I think Insomniac stands out as their finest.  They shunned (barely) some of the immauturity they showed in Dookie, or anything previously released.  Their increasing maturity shows both in the subject matter (eg, the disgusting side effects of meth amphetimine addiction) and the music.  Insomniac is much more enjoyable and fun than the self-aggrandizing rock Green Day produced with American Idiot.  If you haven't already added this to your collection because you're (a) living in a hole, (b) 13 or 14 and only own American Idiot, or (c) any combination of the above, then get this album right away.
B000002UB3|5.0|A lot of people laud the Beatles as the best band ever, which doesn't really seem relevant, they were good, they produced a last great album that's left people touched. <br /> <br />Worth buying, and that's all that needs saying.
B000E97Y6A|4.0|I may be the only living person that didn't know what King Kong was about. I didn't get into the original King Kong or Godzilla so I had no idea what to expect when it came to this movie being in the theater. I went to see it with some skepticism. A giant gorilla? What? WOW. no... WOW! I think I felt nearly every feeling one could feel in a movie theater. I was scared when the actors were. I was bedazzled by Naomi Watt's sparkling blue eyes. I was even in love with King Kong myself after so much had happened that I cried at the end. I can't believe I just wrote that for people to read... anyway, it was truly a surprising and good movie. The effects were no worse than that of Spiderman or Independance Day and the like. If you like effects, and movies that allow you to feel a range of emotions in a 2-3 hour period, you should like this too.
B000000W5N|5.0|Sticky Fingers is the definition of Rock Music, an unparalled masterpiece.  I have some problems with a couple reviews.<br /><br />Colleen M Finley of Pittsburgh writes, \\"To me, the only real talent they have is Kieth Richards and even he is VERY limited in what he does on guitar.\\"  That's insane, Keith Richards is bar none the most innovative Rhythm guitarist that ever lived.  Most guitarist use a standard strumming pattern or a derivation of a classic pattern i.e. John Lee Hooker's stomp, or Bo Diddley's riffs, or Chuck Berry's 12-bar blues comping, or just a standard even tempo strum used in all folk or rock music.  Some guitarist strech out and incorporate Jazz rhythms and chords like Robbie Kreiger or even Carlos Santana's latin influences.  Keith Richards plays a completely original style that has elements of all the above but is never predictable of repetative.  I dare a first time listener of a Stones song to predict where the rhythm and cadence of the guitar is going next or to try to play a faithfull imitation of it.  It's not possible.  Anyone can sit down and learn the chords and rhythm of any Eric Clapton, Eagles,  Lynyrd Skynyrd, Led Zepplin, Rush, Pink Floyd, or Bob Dylan song in minutes but trying to grasp the intricicies of Keith's playin is very difficult.  George Harrison is the only other that comes to mind in the same class as Richard's as far as innovation and unpredictability goes.  That's why Stones songs stand the test of time, because you can listen to them hundreds of times and still hear something new and interesting if you get past the lyrics and melodies and listen to the rhythm.  Colleen's statement is either  un-informed, naive, or just wrong.  She is obviously not a musician.<br /><br />Edward F. Lapinskas of Dade City, Florida writes \\"This was the start of the musical \\"end\\" of the Rolling Stones.<br /><br />About the only 2 songs worth SPIT: Wild Horses & the C/W parody<br /><br />Dead Flowers......It's a 2 song album folks, trust me.\\"  Insane.  Their next album was Exile on Main St, routinely voted their best and also one of the best in the history of rock music.  After 71' they also released some great singles like, Angie, Beast of Burden, Start me Up, and Its only rocknroll but I like it just to name a few.  The idea that Brian Jones was somehow the driving creative force behind the stones is ludicrious.  Even while in the band he was too wasted to contribute by most accounts.  He wrote very few songs and was an inferior guitarist to both Mick Taylor and Ronnie Wood.  Also when the Stones decided they didn't have to compete with the Beatles for who had the most Number One singles their albums flourished.  Thier hits before 69' are mostly predictable, forgettable pop/R&B/rock songs.  Let it Bleed is great but Brian Jones had little or no impact on it.  Keith played most of the guitar with Mick Taylor adding some lead and slide parts esp. on Midnight Rambler.  Brian Jones is credited with Autoharp and Percussion.  For god's sake Ian Stewart and Bobby Keys are much more important to this album and every other Stones album than Brian Jones.  Even on Beggars Banquet, Jones was backing away, and you can hear the difference.  That album includes Sympathy for the Devil, Street Fighting Man, Parachut Woman, and Factory Girl.  Those are Keith Richards' songs not Brian Jones'.  You'd have to go back to \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\" in 1967 on songs like \\"2000 light years from home\\" to see any real Brian Jones impact on the band.  As for Sticky Fingers being a \\"two song album\\".  Wild Horses and Dead Flowers are great but to leave out Can't you hear me knockin is a travesty.  That is probably the single greatest acheivment of the Stones and possibly rock music in the 70's.  It's been in countless movie soundtracks including Casino and Blow.  Their is a power captured on that tape that is chilling to listen to.  The crazy rhythm's of Keith and Mick Taylor are amazing.  It's a rocker but also an atmospheric mood piece.  A true masterpiece.  \\"Fast Eddie\\" also left out the haunting Moonlight Mile, and two of the great up-tempo stones songs Bitch and Brown Sugar.  Don't count out Sway and I got the Blues either.  If Sister Morphine had been written by another band like Velvet Underground it would have been their biggest hit.<br /><br />Keith the Wonderwall writes in a shocking display of hate...\\"Overrated album. Please The Stones can't play music at all. Look at the art cover of this CD. What are they? GAYS?? I think so. At least put the picture of a girl wearing jeans.\\"  This from the same reviewer who gave \\"Who's Next\\" 5 stars.  No disrespect intended to The Who but a lot of their songs reference sexual abuse, and other homosexual activities and are written by Pete Townsend, himself an accused pedophile.  Perhaps Keith the Wonderwall either doesn't listen to the lyrics in music or he simply prefers sex with children over looking at Mick Jagger's crotch.  Also the cover is an Andy Warhol so any homosexual tendancies are understandable.  I'm suprised Amazon allows hateful, prejudicial statements such as these to remain posted.<br /><br />Gary Costello pepperland writes.. .\\"Monotonous.Dull.Uninspiring.Unadventurous. What this CD needs is stuff the calibre of All You Need Is Love or Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey. Stuff that sparkles and shimmers.\\"  Are you really comparing Sticky Fingers to Wings.  All you need is love is a mediocre Beatles song at best.  Uncle Albert, are you kidding me, why not compare it to Silly Love Songs or Ebony and Ivory or Say Say Say or any other piece of crap that SIR Paul McCartney spewed forth with the help of his hack wife in the 70's and 80's.  My god its WINGS.  If thats adventurous and inspiring than I'm gonna shoot myself.<br /><br />Like I said this is the dictionary definition of rock music.  If you had never heard rock before, and you wanted to hear the best of the best, this is what you should listen to.  On this album the Stones are brash, brazen, epherial, epic, sparse, rootsy, stumbling, staggering, raw, real, and timeless.<br /><br />Never again will another band have such a prolific streak of genius similar to the Stones from 68-72.  Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main St.  Gimme Shelter, Tumbling Dice, Street Fighting Man, Wild Horses, Midnight Rambler, Can't you hear me Knockin, Monkey Man, Parachute Woman, Moonlight Mile, any one of these songs let alone albums would make a career for lesser musicians.  The Stones pulled this off in spite of the death of a founding member, constant touring including the famed Altamont concert,  drug addiction, moving to France for tax purposes, the pressures of fame, the death of the \\"peaceful\\" sixties,  and the constant in-fueding in the band.  Like I said the definition of Rock Stars.mood piece.

Uncle Albert, are you kidding me, why not compare it to Silly Love Songs or Ebony and Ivory or Say Say Say or any other piece of crap that SIR Paul McCartney spewed forth with the help of his hack wife in the 70's and 80's.  My god its WINGS.  If thats adventurous and inspiring than I'm gonna shoot myself. <br /> <br />Like I said this is the dictionary definition of rock music.  If you had never heard rock before, and you wanted to hear the best of the best, this is what you should listen to.  On this album the Stonesare brash, brazen, epherial, epic, sparse, rootsy, stumbling, staggering, raw, real, and timeless.   <br /> <br />Never again will another band have such a prolific streak of genius similar to the Stones from 68-72.  Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main St.  Gimme Shelter, Tumbling Dice, Street Fighting Man, Wild Horses, Midnight Rambler, Can't you hear me Knockin, Monkey Man, Parachute Woman, Moonlight Mile, any one of these songs let alone albums would make a career for lesser musicians.  The Stones pulled this off in spite of the death of a founding member, constant touring including the famed Altamont concert,  drug addiction, moving to France for tax purposes, the pressures of fame, the death of the \\"peaceful\\" sixties,  and the constant in-fueding in the band.  Like I said the definition of Rock Stars.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|How anyone could have left the theater and not be emotionally drained by this movie is beyond me.  I actually went in hoping I would not like Heath Ledger's performance.  I was so sick of him constantly emphasizing that he is straight.  Big deal - who cares, (except of-course Hollywood will still blackball you if you come out of the closet) so it really was/is still \\"brave\\" to do this part. <br /> <br />I found the film to be typical of Ang Lee's work - amazing! <br />If you've not seen The Ice Storm I think you would find it a good companion to Brokeback. <br /> <br />And Heath?  Super acting.  The same for the rest of the cast. <br />Be sure to get widescreen for this. <br /> <br />Okay - now all the bigots who've not seen it can do their negatives.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This review might contain spoilers.    This movie is brilliant. The first time I saw Brokeback Mountain, I left the movie theater in a dazed state, trying to digest what I just had seen. Wondering through some crowded streets of NYC on a cold, windy winter night, I never felt more alone. I hurried home. Many movies have left me excited, intrigued and sad. But none have left me as emotionally devastated as Brokeback has. It's as if the movie insinuated itself around my very soul and wrapped its grief around my unsuspecting heart - leaving it heartbroken ever since. The beauty of this movie is that it makes the characters seem so real, so live and their pain so raw, that the sorrow that permeates the story - hinted at first in the display of the most beautiful desolated sceneries, together with a melancholic music score, sneaks in your head, and unknowingly but quite forcefully takes hold of your body and soul and never seems to let them go.    A few weeks later, after countless sleepless nights, unable to shake myself off this stupor, I saw BBM again. This time I left feeling better because it became clear to me that what I had just witnessed was one of the most beautiful love stories ever told. It doesn't matter for me that it happened to be between 2 men. Because there is something so refreshing, so innocent, so lovely about how the story unfolds, that it literally turned this quite jaded, a bit cynical New Yorker, inside out. But I gather that this movie is not meant for everyone. Considering the state of our world today, how we are brought up to fend for ourselves and how we are taught to never let our guards down, we shield our fragile selves from any hint of perceived emotional threats. And we shut down. But I guarantee 100% that if only you could keep the cynicism at bay for the length of this movie, it will transform you. Like I mention before, this movie really makes you hurt, a heartbreaking SOB of a love story that just kills you, but it can be life changing.    Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are phenomenal. Period. This movie wouldn't work if either one of them didn't give his heart and soul completely. What a remarkable screen performance these two give - a performance dug directly from the heart. Amazing. Some criticize that the characters don't develop enough rapport before that first scene in the tent. Nonsense. Haven't you ever heard of something called instant chemistry? And both Heath L. and Jake G. deliver throughout the movie. I bow my head to these guys. Of course the movie wouldn't work either without the great, touching performances from Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway and Roberta Maxwell.     This was a wonderful work from Ang Lee. To portray this movie in such a delicate, sensitive way merits all ovations it gets. During an interview, Ang Lee said that when casting, he decided to go after young and innocent. That choice has really paid off here because in a way that's why the movie works: because to find love when one is so young, so innocent, that is the purest kind of love. When tragedy hits later on the movie, and somehow we kind of expect that from the start, the only thing that remains out of this now flawed, resentful relationship is a sense of love.  But Jack and Ennis' souls have been irremediably broken.    Alas, this is the price these doomed individuals pay for living a life denied and full of lies. The soul dies first before physical death occurs. We see it happen in Jack's case, his soul dying, so touchingly captured in his mournful, dead blank eyes at their last fateful meeting when he watches Ennis' truck speed away. He bitterly tells Ennis: \\"We could've had a good life together...but YOU didn't want it...so Brokeback is all we got\\" finally letting all his resentment spill out on their most unsatisfactory relationship. To which Ennis replies, accusingly, angrily: \\"It's because of you Jack...that I'm like this...I'm nothing...I'm nowhere\\" before collapsing to the ground as if theweight of  this impossible affair suddenly becomes too heavy a burden for him to carry. Jack rushes back to comfort him, and they hug mightily, desperately clinging to one another for they know that they have reached some crossroads in their hearts - their relationship hanging by a thread, they cannot help but watch it slip away.     To his part, Ennis fares no better. When we last see him, alone in that empty, desolated trailer, surveying those shirts that he now tenderly guards, he swears love to a man that no longer exists but in his dreams and memories - a late cry of acknowledgment for what he always had felt but never dared to verbally express during those long 20 years. And like the emptiness of his trailer, Ennis' soul, so long tormented about a crime he saw as a child and so terrified by the notion that the love of his life was another man, cries in despair for a love forever lost, and it is now destined to wither away in solitary confinement.     Thus, the tragedy and paradox of Brokeback Mountain: Love can help save a man from destroying a life that could have been but a man cannot save himself if love is left buried and hidden in the deepest corner of the human heart. Something has to give.  So Jack and Ennis: if only I should come to feel a love like that, God help me, but I for one will not hold back. Thank you for showing me the reason why.
B0000C8AV3|4.0|One of my pet favorite Dylan albums and a return to form when it was released.  The sound is excellent on the SACD release, much warmer than earlier CD releases.  This release is in SACD stereo only, not in SACD surround like Blood on the Tracks.  Still, an essential for the true Dylan fan.
B00000I14Z|5.0|This is the CD you should buy if you're new to Mingus. It came out during a highly creative period in his life, and contains some of his most memorable compostions. Ah Um may not be his most ambitious album or his best, but it is one of his most well rounded and diverse, showing many of the styles, quirks and facets that make Charles Mingus one of the top jazz composers of all time. And it's all laid out in easily digestable morsels, ie some of the songs were edited to make them more concise and able to fit on vinyl. Don't worry, the edits are not noticable. Is it bop? Is it post bop? Is it swing? Well, yes and no. Mingus looks not only to big bands, bebop, and hard bop circa 1959, but also gospel, spirituals, pre-jazz and the blues for inspiration. Ah Um is as diverse and eclectic as it is enjoyable. It points the way to the many directions Mingus was exploring or would explore in his later career. Ah Um is a wonderful look into the music of a great mind and is by turns angry, sad, tender, sarcastic, joyful and damn good. You can feel the passion.
B000003FMY|5.0|This compilation of Russian masterpieces draws from RCA Victor \\"Living Stereo\\" recordings made in Chicago in 1957 and 1959. <br /> <br />Fritz Reiner's 1957 stereophonic recording of Mussorgsky's \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" has long been considered one of the most spectacular and brilliant performances of this famous work.  Orchestrated in 1922 by French master Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) from piano pieces, the music is so much better in its orchestral version.  The true musical impressions of Victor Hartmann's drawings can be really appreciated.  Throughout the various depictions of the pictures, the Chicago Symphony shines forth.  It is a true showcase of the brilliant talents that Reiner worked with in Orchestra Hall.  The listener is captivated by the contrasts in each of the movements and the outstanding performances. <br /> <br />Reiner was a true taskmaster, with extremely high standards, who rivaled Toscanini in his temperament and pursuit of excellence.  Yet he had formidable musicians and, eventually, he actually gave some of his rare praise to what they achieved during the 10 years he was music director in Chicago (1953-1963).  All of recordings in Chicago were recorded in both monaural sound and stereophonic sound. <br /> <br />The \\"March miniature\\" from Tchaikovsky's \\"Suite No. 1 in d minor,\\" Op. 43, is one of several pieces the composer wrote using only high-pitched instruments.  Reiner's performance is absolutely brilliant and, once again, the Chicago musicians were equal to the task.  We are dazzled by the performance of this charming work. <br /> <br />Yes, Reiner does take Mussorgsky's \\"A Night on Bald Mountain\\" TOO FAST.  It is so overwhelming as to be nearly exhausting.  The amazing thing is that the musicians kept up with him.  It is a frightening performance of the orchestration by Rimsky Korsakoff, who often rescued Mussorgsky and other Russian composers when they either failed to orchestrate a piece or were seemingly inadequate in their efforts.  This is the version that Leopold Stokowski made famous in his 1940 multi-channel recording with the Philhadelphia Orchestra for Walt Disney's \\"Fantasia,\\" minus the addition of \\"Ave Maria.\\" <br /> <br />The \\"Polvstian March\\" from Alexander Borodin's opera \\"Prince Igor\\" is one of those pieces that we've sometimes heard and wondered who wrote it.  In Reiner's hands, the pompous and imposing work is given appropriate grandeur and dignity. <br /> <br />Tchaikovsky's \\"March Slave\\" is all too familiar.  It was one of the first orchestral works to be electrically recorded by Victor -- in 1925 by Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra.  Stokowski couldn't resist increasing the bass tones by adding additional instruments.  Reiner remains faithful to the 1876 score, a spectacular precursor to the \\"1812 Overture\\" minus cannons and bells.  It is a powerful performance that rivals the 1959 stereo recording by Reiner's former student, Leonard Berstein, and the New York Philharmonic.  (That recording was originally made by Columbia and reissued by Sony.) <br /> <br />Finally, there is a very showy, highly syncopated overture to Kabalevsky's \\"Colas Breugnon.\\"  Believe it or not, Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra recorded this in 1942 (also for RCA Victor) and it became a staple of that orchestra's 1950 transcontinental tour.  Reiner's performance closely matches Toscanini's for all of its intensity, excitement, and precision. <br />
B0000024TT|5.0|I first heard this album in college...I had heard some of his songs done by others (Judy Collins). But I had never heard them sung as they were meant to be sung, like this. I was lucky to be at a University with a great library, so I checked out some of his written poetry...great stuff. I also wore out several LP's of this album, which has so many classics on it (who can watch \\"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\\", directed by Robert Altman, and not think the movie was made all the more perfect by \\"The Master Song\\" and \\"The Sisters of Mercy\\"?)Perfect!...Bob N.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This movie provides a gateway into the world of Bondage and Discipline, Dominance and Submission without the porn, without the Jerry Springer-esque overplay.  Many people have had private thoughts about this without ever acting on them - due to the darkness built around it.  This movie lifts that veil.  It shows that the deepness of love that can only come in this type of relationship.  The one drawback to the film is its treatment of the primary subjects as having mental health issues.  I highly recommend this film for mature audiences who have fantasized but never progressed beyond mere fantasy.  Even the spanking technique demonstrated that all involved knew what they were doing - it was more than simply great acting.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|This movie had absolutely no plot and is the only movie that has ever left me feeling suckered at the end. I went to see it with three friends and we were all visibly angry at the end. We agreed that it was most regretful that we spent our time and money on this bloody, grotesque, carelessly put together film. I welcome sex and gore in movies, but when that's ALL there is and the plot is sacrificed mercilessly, the viewer is left lost and at the end, most angry.  <br /> <br />WARNING: let this be one you never see or pay money for. Trust me...

B00005Q4CS|5.0|What is truly spectacular about this film is that I know people who continue to abuse drugs after having seen Requiem for a Dream, How Pathetic!  If this film's horrifying portrayal of the affects of drug and addiction isn't enough to convict a drug user to make an effort to quit, then it is a sad testimony to the will and drive of the people in this world.  Ellen Burstyn gave a breathtaking performance!  I never cry during movies (Its not that I'm cold hearted, I just don't cry during movies!), but I have never been closer to tears than I was during the final \\"Requiem\\" of the movie.  This is a revolutionary film, and should be required viewing for all of today's youth.
1577314808|3.0|Why purchase a book with the title, \\"Power of Now\\"?  I didn't think it would turn me into a Buddha in 30 days but I was looking for practical suggestions on how to stop the constant flow of negativity my brain feeds to my poor psyche.  I found it helpful for that task.  Specifically I wanted to get away from obsessive thinking in reaction to a stressful event in my life.<br /><br />How did this book help exactly?  By reminding me in many different ways that I and our culture rely too much on thinking to solve problems the brain simply can't be expected to solve.  For example, if my boss yells at me and makes me feel incompetent, letting myself feel the hurt, shame and anger in a direct way without the interference of a lot of internal chatter is far better than anything my mind could think up.<br /><br />I used the book to compliment my meditation practice.  I would read a section that discussed the limitations of the rationale mind to answer questions of better living.  I would then meditate and realize that just because my mind couldn't solve this problem, it didn't mean I was out of options.<br /><br />This doesn't mean I thought the book was faultless.  It often feels redundant and could have used a series of tips on how to stop thinking unproductively.  I also thought there were times when the answers to questions were harsh and even angry.  I'm not sure that helps people to get away from the negativity that plagues all our lives.
B000EGF0B4|3.0|I have a real problem with film critics who praise a movie for being \\"brave.\\"  While Brokeback Mountain took the controversy of Homosexuality and through it onto the table in front of the public's eye, it did not hold its own as a film. <br /> <br />First and foremost, Brokeback Mountain was hardly revolutionary in regards to social tolerance.  Many motion pictures have portrayed gay men and women in a positive light.  In fact, television had a one up on Ang Lee's \\"masterpiece\\" when Will & Grace was aired. <br /> <br />Despite the social impact (or lack thereof) Brokeback Mountain was a poorly made film.  The acting was mediocre at best, the adaption of the short story was nothing to write home about, and the story itself is in no way unique.  If one were to remove the \\"gay\\" aspect of the film one would find a shell that is the basic construction of any generic love triangle film that is designed to tug at the viewers heart strings. <br /> <br />It is devestating that movies are now being judged on their social controversy rather than the exucution of the vital aspects of cinema.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|A lot of people tend to say one thing about Hollywood remakes: why? What for? When you have an original that's easily a classic, there almost seems little point to revisit. Peter Jackson said King Kong was his inspiration to be a filmmaker so maybe it's a case of the student trying to become the teacher? A way of saying \\"thanks\\"? An update? I don't know but as it stands the film is pretty good entertainment with large amount of flaws all over the place.    You all know the story but I must repeat it. Carl Denham is a filmmaker who is not delivering on his films. He decides to get out quickly on a filmmaking chance of a lifetime but he needs an actress. He finds Ann Darrow, a struggling vaudeville actress. Bringing her in, they head toward the mysterious Skull Island where more than just locals roam.    Officially the film won for Best Visual Effects which personally I don't understand. There's obvious CG shots all over the place including some much needed redos on compositing. In New York at the end it's absolutely beautiful on top of the Empire State Building but on Skull Island it's almost cringe-inducing at parts. Not to mention the sounds outside of Kong are merely ok but go figure, they won Best Sound and Sound Editing. T-Rex's don't sound big enough personally.    The other flaw is the action sequences. Yes they're cool and yes they're exciting but they're also incredibly silly. When you got guys running from a herd of brontosaurs and only 4 or so get trampled in such a narrow space is hard to believe. Not to mention when they topple over. Then there's Kong fighting no less than 3 V-Rexes(apparently they're not T ones they're V) with only bites doesn't add up. No big chunk missing or torn flesh, it's merely teeth marks and blood. It might sound like I'm nitpicking but when you want people to believe in such an extravagant world it helps to nail reality's details, even if it does have large spiders and a gorilla.    One more nitpick: its editing and length. Much of this film could've been chopped off. Spielberg even when making the 2 1/2 hour Close Encounters or 3+ hour Schindler's List, never made a boring film(some exceptions may apply). Jackson on the other hand might need to fire his editor since so much is rather unneccessary. It's as if the only way to make the film epic is to pack it with as much as you can. Subplots and sidestories(such as a cabin boy and a father-like figure) are never resolved.     Where the film works is the acting, despite its odd casting choices. Jack Black makes a good Denham but not an excellent one and Adrien Brody doesn't scream action hero to me. The supporting cast is good though with the under-utilized Colin Hanks(bit of a slip when I mentioned Tom instead). Naomi Watts is the perfect Ann Darrow though, tough and very emotional. In fact, it's probably rare to not find her teary eyed in the film, and quite a set of lungs. Her screams people although the other thing...    It's one of the most biggest and expensive movies ever yet I feel it's not an A picture but it's not a so bad it's good B picture. It's like a B+, entertaining but so much problems it has.
0446677450|4.0|This book gives you a glimpse into the possibilities of how to become rich.  He uses his personal life experiences to reinforce what has been taught to him.

B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Yawn. While remaining more or less true to the original, I found the performances and as well as the script of this latest version of Pride and Prejudice lacking. It seemed to move at a snail's pace and I had to keep bumping up the volume to catch the dialogue. The characterizations were lackluster and the performances uninspired. <br /> <br />Save your money and buy the BBC version. It's far superior to this one in every way--and even at four hours long, it moves faster than this one.
0736697659|1.0|Unfortunately some audio books are read in monotone-very dull indeed-but in this audio book the reader goes too far in the opposite direction by reading an adult book as if it's story time and she's a preschool teacher.  <br /> <br />My daughters and I loved the main characters in audio books such as Bridget Jones Diary, The Nanny Diaries, and Sammy's Hill because the reader made us sympathize with them. We knew that whatever the characters did they did with sincerity and whatever happened to them could happen to anyone. Emily Gray, the reader of Can You Keep a Secret, made the main character sound witless and very, very phony. All of the other characters sounded one dimensional. <br /> <br />We listen to audio books on our frequent long car trips. Although we had nothing else to listen to at the time, we could only stand  of this book before we had to turn it off. A few weeks later I randomly read a few chapters of Can You Keep a Secret in a bookstore and thought that it was amusing. Perhaps Emily Gray didn't find the book amusing, so she thought that she needed to go \\"over the top\\" to add humor. If so, it didn't work. She took a lighthearted, enjoyable book and turned it into the equivalent of listening to nails on a blackboard.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|Usually when you buy a cd, there's only one or two songs that are good, but all the songs on this cd are good.  That's a rare thing!!  I would recommend this CD and the \\"Caught in the Act\\" DVD.  On the DVD, Michael Buble has so much energy and he comes across as a very nice guy.  He flirts with the audience, engages them, and talks to them. The DVD was very entertaining and it is so good that you could watch it over and over, again. The CD and DVD would make a great combination for a Michael Buble fan!! <br />
B000EQH2QK|5.0|Before saying the record company wants money of the fans, please READ...go to shakira.com and get HIPS DONT LIE from the official site in the virtual club the requirements are: OF2 CD (not the bonus version, obviously) and thats it. <br />Now if you haven't buy this CD....this CD before HIPS DONT LIKE was all GRAMMY winner, now with HIPS DONT LIE and LA TORTURA is more commercial. I think it was a good move, so people will listen to Shakira's musician side and the commercial musician Shakira. <br />Good move. <br />And dam this album deserves 10 stars
B000A6T1KE|4.0|This one is difficult to review. The technical aspects of the Special Collector's Edition are remarkable. A crisp, beautiful widescreen transfer on disc one. Disc two has wonderful, if sad insight into the \\"final\\" production. The one problem I have is the deleted scenes. Normally 95% of the time I agree with the cuts left on the editing floor. However, there are a couple of crucial scenes that were cut and I think should have remained in the film. I didn't know Beverly was promoted until I saw the deleted scene. Also the deleted scene with Picard and Data discussing life over a glass of wine makes the decisions in the film more acceptable. This is still an underrated, well written film and is a fitting (yet sad) ending for an absolutely fine cast.
B00002E23E|1.0|Are you people insane? This is horrible, the music is good yes but the footage is bad and it's hard to watch unless you're high. The fantasy scenes are just boring and you're thinking okay that's nice now get back to the concert footage. Zeppelin fans shouldn't waste time with this, instead you should check out their other concert dvd because it's way better than this.
B00008PX8P|2.0|I would recommed this dvd to die hard Zeppelin fans only. I'm only a causual fan and I really don't care for concert footage that much unless it's Rammstein because they know how to put on a good show with good music. Anyways you get a lot of concert footage here starting from their early days all the way to their end. The footage itself was shot very poorly at times and the audio isn't all that great. Now the band on the other hand play very well and give off a good energy. The only problem are the 20 minute long solo's. I find myself fastforwarding through them because they are boring and you just lose interest in them. The bonus feature includes them playing some of the same songs but on T.V. shows or in front of  a very small group in a room. There are also interviews which are interesing to watch because there aren't too many of them out there. On the interviews they seem to be very shy and soft spoken.   I would recommend that you get this if you're a die hard fan because I think that you would enjoy the cocert footage and the interviews for the most part. If you're a casual fan like me you probably wouldn't like it that much so I would recommend that you borrow it or rent it first before buying it.
6305736650|2.0|I may be prejudiced by the fact that I absolutely hate romance.  Romantic comedy and musicals I can stand (to an extent, as I don't like An American in Paris).  But I hate pure romance.   <br /> <br />I came into the movie thinking it was something like Notorious, romantic suspense or something of that nature.  I was incredibly wrong.  It was pure romance, pure romance. <br /> <br />Basically the plot is this: Rick (Humphrey Bogart), who runs a bar in Casablanca, where all the refugees go (during WWII), sees an old flame (Ingrid Bergman) again.  This recalls the days in Paris shortly before he left.  She comes and talks to him.  She says she's married to this guy (Paul Hendrid).  Rick had seen them together in his bar.  The guy is prominent on the Nazi blacklist and so the Gestapo, who just arrived, want to see to it that he stays in Casablanca.  There are some twists and the movie ends. <br /> <br />Seen that way, it seems absurd that anyone could stretch this over the course of a movie an hour and forty minutes long.  Frankly it is.  Sure, I cut out all the mushy parts and the fancy lines (\\"Here's looking at you, kid!\\"), etc.   <br /> <br />Claude Rains and Peter Lorre are the best actors of the bunch.  Bergman is okay.  Hendrid sort of mutters his lines so it's hard to understand them.  I hate Bogart's voice-it's raw, high-pitched and sort of shrill.  That and he kind of slurs or has a lisp or something.  And his looks-his face looks like a hollowed out corps-haggard.  Probably he was on drugs or alcohol. <br /> <br />The opening was horrible.  Unnecessary and left me wondering who the movie was going to be about.  I mean, I have no problem with establishing shots.  But never should the camera stop on a person and should those people have an honest to goodness line (not brushing over).  It makes you think the movie's gonna be about them.  But the opening to this movie does that constantly. <br /> <br />People say this is the best movie that has ever been made.  I'll second that, with one minor modification, \\"it's the worst movie that has ever been made\\".  Fine, maybe not the worst.  But just plain stupid.  Not worth watching again.  No tension, no real suspense.  It's a good movie to see what WWII was like (this was made before it was over).  Other than that, it stinks on ice. <br />
B000E1ZBH2|1.0|This movie was like watching a bunch of self impressed fools telling us that a quickie was much better than the real thing. The heart of the story is that the relationship sneaks up on both parties and yet here we have Elizabeth looking and behaving like a weekend slattern. This is an uncomfortable mix of American and English cultures, like a gay man in a marriage, I'm sure they tried hard but completely missed the mark.
B000E97HIA|4.0|I thought the next Prince album that I played incessantly would be one that featured his old sound--the exotic effects, and rhythms and the ever present Linn Drum sounds that permeated most of his work up through the Sign O' The Times Album. W-R-O-N-G!!!!! 3121 grows on you like Kudzu ! Except, without the creepiness! I didn't think he could get it done without resorting to his old tricks-=-but he did! Though you do get a hint of the old sound on tracks like the \\"Kiss\\"-like \\"Black Sweat\\" --sparse with drums and keyboard and that classic falsetto--this track is the track that hooks you and then the others work their magic on you, and slowly you begin to feel the old Prince in these new tracks. Other highlights are Lolita, Incense And Candles, Love, Fury and my personal favorite The Dance. This song is almost--almost like nothing he's ever done before, yet it's classic Prince and you really start to feel it towards the end of the song when he begins to wail and scream a la \\"The Beautiful Ones\\". Chilling. Only the one and only Prince could produce a best of album that doesn't feature any of his previous works.  B-U-Y I-T!  D-O-N-T  B-O-O-T  I-T
B000000QFV|4.0|Musically, this is a great album. Iommi is brilliant and once again proves he is the God of guitar riffs. Just like the original line-up this cast of cool cats is solid with Tony Martin on vocals, Neil Murray on bass and the great Cozy Powell (RIP) on drums the musicianship is top notch to say the least. I consider TYR to be a progressive metal album, which is a departure for Black Sabbath and does take time to getting used to. I would have rated this five stars but there are some small elements on this that don't agree with me, First being Martins vocals which I love on Cross Purposes and Forbidden and on TYR his melody lines are fantastic and memorable. It's the power metal-vibrato-epic vocal style and the lyrical content (pretty bad) that I am not too crazy about. The whole Norse mythology concept is just not Black Sabbath. Lastly, I think Geoff Nicholls is great on keyboards but just like on Headless Cross it takes away from the raw feel of the album. However, these are small complaints and just my opinion. There are some really contagious tracks such as Anno Mundi, Jerusalem, Valhalla and Feels Good To Me. TYR is very much underrated and an overlooked gem. This is definitely worth owning.
B00005JNEI|1.0|It's obvious that Michael Moore hates President Bush with a passion.  It's also obvious that this clearly anti-Bush propaganda film was completely ineffective in taking any votes away from Bush in his 2004 re-election bid. <br /> <br />Or, if this pseudo-documentary WAS effective, then Bush would have actually gotten even MORE than the 62-million votes he received had it not been released?  Interesting. <br /> <br />Speaking of elections, my favorite part of this entire film was watching Vice President Al Gore telling the mostly black congresswomen protesting the election certification to sit down and shut-up unless they could get at least one Democratic Senator to agree with their protest.  They couldn't.  Gore seems almost contemptuous of their efforts to keep his presidential bid alive.  He looks almost embarrassed.  But I guess Michael Moore didn't notice that, or why would he have included it in a film that was supposed to be blasting Bush?
B000002KHH|1.0|Wow I can't believe anyone likes Black Sabbath so much...they really are overrated, annoying, lousy, lame, & stupid just like Queen...plus always played on San Francisco's 107.7 The Bone.  <br />black sabbath sucks black sabbath sucks black sabbath sucks black sabbath sucks black sabbath sucks black sabbath sucks black sabbath sucks black sabbath sucks black sabbath sucks <br />Black sabbath sucks...buy any album from Green Day, Dire Straits, or Guns N' Roses insted.
0920668372|5.0|Because this book had me in tears and I couldn't finish reading it to my 2 year old son. Curses to my sister who gave it to us! <br />Honestly, it's a beautiful book about a parents love for her child.  <br />And don't take the mothers stalking so literally.
B000002UAX|5.0|These are the Beatles best 2 songs.....Birthday and Hey Jude and they are recommended and rock. <br />
B00001MXXH|5.0|This movie still stands as one of my all time favorites.  With a great lead performance from Matthew Broderick, and a good supporting cast all around, this movie takes a simple premise and runs with it.  A typical hooky day by some high-schoolers turn into an irreverant adventure of epic proportions.  This isn't a masterpiece of a movie, but one that'll make you laugh and feel good every time you watch it.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|MAKING MOVIES is a great album by one of the greatest rock groups of all time, Dire Straits. This is an awesome love album and contains great love songs like Tunnel Of Love, & Expresso Love. Highly recommended along with LOVE OVER GOLD AND ON EVERY STREET. GO GRAB THIS LOVELY ALBUM TODAY.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Do you like Star Wars? Indiana Jones? Well here is a great series that is the perfect blend of Science Fiction and the wild west! I had no idea that I would like this sooooo much! I had never heard of the tv series FireFly but after seeing the movie Serenity I bought the firefly series DVD as well! I am hooked!<br /><br />Enjoyed the humor and witty banter!!! Excellent Characters!
B00006LWSF|4.0|I think people get Em all wrong. they hear his lyrics and dont like what they hear. my parents for example dont want me listening to him for that reason. But i do anyway. Em sings about experiences and maybe he takes it a little 2 far sometimes but you know, who doesn't??? todays society is different from that 20 years ago. parents are use to the beatles and the beach boys and dont want to hear todays music. ang then they hear what Em has to say and dont like it. People, get over it. Em might not sing about surfing but he most definetly rules the music world!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie is a great look into the lives of regular people.  I love the way it concentrates on several stories at once.  It is funny, light hearted, sweet, and happy.  It's a great date movie or chick flick.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I got this as a Christmas present, it was actually the DVD/CD package. Not as enjoyable to me as Violator and Music For the Masses, but artists evolve and we can't live in the past can we? I enjoy most of the album, particularly Suffer Well (an excellent tune by Gahan), Precious, and A Pain that I'm Used to. Sometimes the album drags, but it is a welcome shift from Exciter, probably in my opinion, the worst DM album ever. I tried and tried to like it, just didn't work.  <br />If you enjoy DM, you need to give this one a try. <br />
B000089RVX|5.0|I remember when I first heard Bring Me To Life on the radio. I was intrigued but not terribly impressed at first listen. It was the sort of sound that grew on me, steadily, until I couldn't wait to hear it again. I don't buy a lot of CDs since I find them to be a waste of $$ if you only like one song (especially now that you can download singles from iTunes very easily and cheaply), but bought this CD anyhow. I'm glad I did! I love every single song on here. Sure, it's moody and depressing, but sometimes I'm in that kind of frame of mind. The lead singer sounds like an angel belting out her tunes from inside the gates of hell. Or something like that. In any case, it works for me and it's one of my faves. Recommended. 5 stars. :-)
B0000CNY27|4.0|During the 1980's a common theme was arising amongst some of the films being made in the realm of sci-fi and/or action films.  That trend was that of the anti-hero, or even a villain that was so cool you couldn't help but root for them.  There were several movies that were made that used the anti-hero as the main attraction for a movie, \\"The Terminator\\" and \\"Dirty Harry\\" are a couple of examples (though to be fair the original \\"Dirty Harry\\" movie was in the 70's, but the series continued through the 80's).  Needless to say, America loves its anti-heroes and sometimes even it's cinematic villains.  But before Arnold uttered the words, \\"I'll be back,\\" in James Cameron's brilliant sci-fi adventure \\"The Terminator\\", Kurt Russell uttered an equally iconic phrase that would become synonymous with another pulp icon, \\"Call me, Snake.\\"  Those words were heard for the first time in John Carpenter's 1981 cult classic \\"Escape From New York\\", and ever since whenever you hear that phrase, most people immediately think of the popular anti-hero of that movie, Snake Plissken. <br /> <br />\\"Escape From New York\\" takes place in a world ravaged by crime, and to combat the increasing criminal element, the United States government has turned the entire island of Manhattan into a giant walled prison where the worst of the worst are placed.  Most of the country, and the government for that matter has forgotten all about these prisoners of New York, that is until the President of the United States (Donald Pleasance) crash lands inside the walls of the island prison.  To rescue him is no easy task, and the only way for the mission to succeed is to use someone who happens to have the necessary training and skills to get inside and handle himself, while at the same time appearing to fit in with the criminal element.  And there is only one man perfectly qualified for that job, the notorious outlaw and former special forces operative, Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell). <br /> <br />With a quick pace, plenty of action, and very sharp wit, \\"Escape From New York\\" is a wonderfully crafted post-apocalyptic adventure from one of the horror genre's greatest directors, John Carpenter (director of \\"The Fog\\" and \\"Halloween\\").  Carpenter along with Kurt Russell have created an iconic character that is still incredibly fun and engaging to watch even 25 years later.  To assist Kurt Russell, Carpenter employed a strong cast of actors/actresses from Harry Dean Stanton to Isaac Hayes to Lee Van Cleef and even Ernest Borgnine.  All of these characters are unique and quirky, yet still realistic in their representation, thanks in no small part to the gifted actors playing the parts.  Of course the plot to the movie would have been nothing if not for the President trapped behind enemy lines, Donald Pleasance (who worked with John Carpenter on \\"Halloween\\") brings the sniveling, cowardly Commander-in-Chief to entertainingly, despicable life.   <br /> <br />Everything about this movie was well put together, and to think it only cost $5 million to make, which is nothing by today's standards and even back then wouldn't have been considered a blockbuster film.  Though it was made with a cheap price tag, the box office receipts clearly showed that to have a successful run in theaters you don't have to have a lot of fancy special effects, just a well-written script, with gifted actors and a director with a keen eye to make everything go together smoothly. <br /> <br />\\"Escape From New York\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B000E97HIA|4.0|THIS CD IS PURE PRINCE THE WAY HE \\"IS NOW\\" NOT HOW SOME WRITERS WHO CANNOT ACCEPT ARTIST WHO \\"EVOLVE AND GROW\\" WANT HIM TO BE. YOU PEOPLE NEED TO GET OVER YOURSELF. R U THE SAME PERSON THAT YOU WERE BACK IN THE 80'S-90'S? TO ALL YOU WHO THINK THAT THIS ALBUM OR ANY ALBUM COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. SO COULD YOUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT, YOUR GPA IN HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE, YOU RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD ETC. BUT GUESS WHAT THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE. THEY COULD NOT BE ANY BETTER AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE!!! GET IT? SORRY FOR THE POP PSYCHOLOGY BUT I HAD TO GET THAT OUT. THIS CD IS TIGHT!!!!!
B00005JO20|3.0|The original movie had a great musical score.  This movie does not.  I can't remember a single song after watching it.  It's a shame that movies aren't scored well anymore.  What happened to music that was composed with full orchestras in mind? <br /> <br />Aside from that I didn't like the part of Ann defending the Ape.  It seemed too pro-ecology and politically correct for the 1930's.  America was not politically correct in the 1930's or in the original movie.  Let's keep it that way in the remake.  There should of been more of an attraction between Driscol and Ann.  He should of married her and had Kong steal her against her will.  The part of Ann dancing for Kong was stupid it reminded me of the hideous 1970's version.   <br /> <br />Denham should of been more likeable.  He seemed like such a rascal.   <br /> <br />The special effects were great, but come on 3 t-rexs.  Less is more should be the key to this movie.  The plot development leading to Skull island was way to long. Another thing this movie did not do was make it suspenseful when they are going through the island.  The original had you on the edge of your seat.  What were they going to see next?   <br /> <br /> <br />Ann trying to rescue the ape at the empire state building was stupid and also reminded me of the hideous 1970's version. <br /> <br />The remake could of been a lot worse.  At least Peter Jackson did a much better job than the remake of 30 years ago.  If some one else had remade it could of been alot worse. <br />
B000E97HIA|5.0|Overall 3121 is a fabulous album.  The Funky One definately lets his funk influences out in 3121.  The lyrics and at some points the compositions of his songs bring back some of his Purple Rain days.  My favorite track so far is \\"Love,\\" but my favorite track keeps changing everytime I listen to 3121. There's something new to appreciate that you may have missed when you heard the album the first time around.<br /><br />The downside is it lacks some of the punch that is almost expected by fans ever since Purple Rain. The lyrics are raw, but Prince would lose some of the soul in his words during the middle of the album.<br /><br />For a Prince album this may have been 4 stars to most fans.  I give it a 5 because compared to what is out there right now in the Top 40 and Urban scene, this is definately one of the best albums to be released this year.
038533348X|5.0|\\"Don't be a fool! Close this book at once! It is nothing but foma! Foma of course, are lies\\" (177). This is the title page of \\"The Books of Bokonon\\" (177), the fictional and Nihilistic religion in Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. Vonnegut uses Bokononism as a device to communicate his social commentary on science, religion, and human stupidity. Although Cat's Cradle is a witty, black comedy based around the end of the world, it makes you think while you are laughing. This book is a beautifully written classic and is an essential read for any fan of Vonnegut's work. <br /> This novel starts out with the narrator, John, doing research for his book about \\"what important Americans had done on the day when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima\\" (11). This leads John to the \\"father of the first atomic bomb\\" (14), Felix Hoenikker, and his very unusual family. He has a midget son named Newt and his other son, Franklin, is the assistant to the dictator of the island of San Lorenzo. San Lorenzo is the main setting of the story and is home to religious leader, Bokonon. While on the island, the old dictator dies and John becomes president. Before Felix died, he made a substance called ice-nine, which makes water freeze at room temperature, simply because he thought it was interesting. Ironically, combined with human stupidity this crystal of ice leads to the destruction of all life on the planet.  <br /> Cat's Cradle is a cynical and pessimistic portrayal of humanity. Vonnegut owes this outlook to his harsh life. His mother committed suicide on mother's day in 1944; he was a prisoner of war during the firebombing of Dresden; he watched his sister die of cancer; and he himself tried to commit suicide in 1984. His experiences in the war and his life have led him to become a pacifist and this moral vision shows through in Cat's Cradle.  <br /> Underneath the humor in this novel, Vonnegut gives cutting social commentary. His thoughts about religion are demonstrated through Bokononism. Bokonon says, \\"she was a fool, and so am I, and so is anyone who thinks he sees what God is Doing\\" (13), showing Vonnegut's disapproval of organized religion and its interpretation of god. He also writes that when man asked God about the meaning of life, God replied, \\"'everything must have a purpose? Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this', and He went away\\" (177). Bokononism holds that the only meaning in life is to search for a purpose. Although this Bokononism is meant to parody religion, it brings up interesting existential questions about the meaninglessness of life.  <br /> When this book was written, Vonnegut was commenting on the Cold War and the foolishness of man in building weapons that could destroy the world. In today's age of the \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" and impending doom from terrorists, these themes and ideas are still applicable. He ironically has the \\"father of the atomic bomb\\" (14) creating a simple crystal of ice that eventually destroys the world. This warns against carelessness regarding life and the foolishness of building weapons capable of destroying humanity. Vonnegut makes a convincing argument for pacifism by making fun of the consequences of war and destruction.  <br />  In Cat's Cradle, Kurt Vonnegut perfectly balances humor with thoughtfulness. This unique style and tone in his writing separates him from any other author and he gets his point across without preaching to the reader. This book is a masterpiece of literature and is Vonnegut's greatest work of art. <br />
B00069A5GY|2.0|Can't say enough about this album. I got it as traditional CD several months ago, and it is, by far, the best music I've bought all year. Due the sparse selection of DVD-A, I was thrilled to see it offered here in this format. The positive reviews on the mix were even more encouraging. I've got a dedicated DVD-Audio player run through a Pioneer 135 watts per channel amp running Klipsh KG 5.5 mains and comperable center, surrounds and sub. -Not a totally high-end system, but it'll hold its own.  <br />I have to say that I was disapointed when I heard the album for one reason: Knopfler's voice is 95% relegated to the center channel. Perhaps it's a matter of taste, but there is way too much separation between voice and instuments. The idea of 5 channel separation is a wonderful thing when done right -any Donald Fagen, Hotel California, but there's a fine line in the mixing between perfection and annoying. In my opinion, this one crosses that line. Some may love it; to me, it's unbalanced and makes for a frustrating listening experience.  <br />-Brian
0140177396|3.0|This masterpeice was written in 1937 by a man named John Steinbeck. He was born in salinas, California 1902 he grew up in a fertile Agricultural valley about twenty five miles from the pacific coast, now to the story this was a rather good book in my opinion it is based on two main characters named lenny and George the story takes place a few miles south of soledad, Where the Salinas river drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green. <br />       well you see lennie is a monster of a man who is shapeless of the face and heavy set and is slightly mently undeveloped because when he was a child he was kicked in the head by a horse but he can work, George is a little different he is small and very defined in terms of muscle tone. <br />      This story is basicly about two guys one is mentally challenged and the other is not however they stick together and go through a lot of things together and then they also move to different job sites to get more money when thet leave a town called weed they go to another one and there is baiscly the main set of the story where most of there time is spent during there time at this place they are working and lennie is helplessly trying to make friends. then at the end of the story lennie kills george and is very dissapointed at his choices later then the other guys he works with went and bought him a drink for doing it.
B00005JO20|5.0|Okay, now that Peter Jackson has created the definitive KING KONG, no one else should even try it again.  This is an awesome filmmaking achievement, with some of the best special effects ever captured on the screen.  We all know the story, so it was up to Jackson to create a new vision of the tale and that he has done.  Although the movie starts slowly, once they reach Skull Island, the movie never lets up:  Kong vs. the Tyrannosaures is brilliant, especially the dizzying battle on the hanging vines; the terrifying bug attacks; the finale on the Empire State Building which is both terrifying and poignantly touching; the dinosaur stampede; it's all beautifully done.  Naomi Watts shines as Ann Darrow, the beauty to the giant beast.  Watts captures the fervor in which the relationship develops, and of course using Andy Sirkis digitally as Kong is pure genius.  He gives Kong a truly individual personality never captured in either of the first two films.  Adrian Brody is good as the writer who shares Ann's passion for the beast.  Only Jack Black as Denham is miscast, and although ineffectual, he doesn't hurt the movie.  Wonder why they didn't go for a better actor in this role?<br /><br />Anyway, KING KONG is everything a big Hollywood movie should be and the Oscars while honoring \\"message\\" films this year, failed to recognize the most entertaining and technically superior film of all this year--KING KONG.

1400062071|2.0|It's so fascinating to read reviews by ordinary readers like all of us, not literary reviews.  Human nature is so diverse. The latest edition of The New Yorker gave a very favorable review of this book.  But for me, I don't know that this was the worst book I've read in the last few months, but it came close.  I couldn't have been less interested in the characters, the subject matter, the location - the whole book left me cold.  I have read comparisons to Gilead - a wonderful book.  Abide with Me is not in the same league, not even playing the same game.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This is a great fun band.  All of the songs have different, interesting, and definitely catchy rhythms to them.  These songs are great to sing along to and are just plain fun.   <br /> <br />The bad reviews I've read only complained that they signed before they ever played live and they are the first band on decaydance records.  Who cares.  Listen to the music cause you like it.  Not because of who they sign with.  Or if you are going to be listening to them 2 years from now.  Again, who cares.   Listen to what you like now.  You probably won't listen to 70% of the bands you like now, 2years from now.   <br /> <br />It's a great CD, listen to it.  Also if you like Panic!, try \\"Wonderful Beef\\", \\"Full Speed Ahead\\", or \\"Midgets with Guns\\" by 'Pain'
B000ENWKN8|4.0|This is what i expected.  A verry good disc.  All of the tracks is great well worth the money. If you like Rob then get it you won't be disappointed.
