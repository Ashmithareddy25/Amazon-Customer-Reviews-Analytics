006202406X|1.0|I wish I wouldn't have read this book. The shifting back and forth between two voices was distracting.  The first book in this series was great and the second was good. This one; however was just awful. Too much time was given to the twists and not enough to the characters.  I didn't feel as if there was anything meaningful in this book. So, so disappointed!  And the ending...it is a let down to say the least. What was the point?
B00000JMOF|5.0|Another early movie that let your mind generate the fear.  It is implied fear.  It leaves you to decide what happens next after the fade out.  That is when the mind generates any and all imaginings.  Colin Clive's portrayal is right on for a driven scientist.  Driven right to the very edge of madness when the creature comes alive.
B008B3MZNI|4.0|I am 55.  I did not see this tour.  I could have, I was old enough.  Just didn't.  So, present day.  I know the album, missed the original show and bought the blu-ray.  I liked it.  It was cool to see the songs done live.  I probably had a better seat at home than most of the people that saw the original show had.  Yes, the quality is not blu-ray, but so what.  I chose to start buying everything in blu-ray and the fact of the matter is that not everything that is released is remastered to some kind of high tech modern quality.  I bought this for the historical concert fact.  Supertramp.  Live video that I missed, and I can't relive with that line up of the band.

B00DJZR46G|4.0|I prefer more slow songs by Elton and love the piano in this one.  A lot of originality as always.
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|This album is amazing - the beats, the production, the lyrics, the feelings it evokes are amazing.  Arcade Fire fire fans will not be disappointed.  The only reason I could not give it 5 stars is that I think it would be a tighter album if after Joan of Arc the next song was Porno, and then the album would finish with Afterlife.  Here Comes the Night Time II is not necessary and Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice) and It's Never Over (Hey Orpheus), while having some amazingly beautiful parts, kind of lack the focus of the other songs.  And Supersymmetry is more like the last song at the end of movie credits.  I would have liked to seen the album composed of the 9 songs I recommended and have the the other 4 songs as bonus tracks or B-sides.
1449305172|5.0|If you need a blueprint for how to get marketing, product, data, and development teams to work well together AND delight customers, read this book.  It's also the perfect book to read after you've finished that innovation seminar, are pumped up to innovate, but don't know how to translate the energy into momentum. I've found that the systematic Running Lean approach can work well or be easily adapted for many different types of businesses.
B00005JLIU|5.0|Loved this as a child, will love it till I die of old age. Great romp through 1920's.

B005LAIIGW|3.0|There were six to eight minute action scenes, the likes of which one may have never witnessed before. A very poetic science fiction about earth and at the same time very easy to follow. I've seen a lot of Alfonso films including Rudo Y Cursi, Y Tu Mama Tambien (all time top ten) and Children of Men. This is his fourth best. This is his entry to the list of all time best films but at the same time, it failed to hit home like any of his other films did. He has also done Pan's Labyrinth and Bitiful but they are not in the same league as the other films I mentioned. Like Quentin with Inglourious Basterds, there comes a film which introduces a great film maker to the world or rather reintroduces the film maker. This film re-introduces the audience to the Alfonso Cuaron. But honestly, I like his \\"brain churners\\" like Rudo Y Cursi and Y Tu Mama Tambien way more. The photography, depiction, video, clarity, sex, everything is just so beyond the beyond. He is one heck of a film maker and sometimes he leaves you baffled. Just writing a review for a film of this magnitude makes you miss it. The acting is OK compared to how the earth, the moon, the universe behaves. You will get lost and found. A realistic journey into those lonely places that have no gravity. So much so it makes you realize the existence of something earthlings take for granted.

B0031KC8OW|5.0|When I first started watching Veronica Mars, I thought it was just another high school TV show. Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />Veronica Mars is so wonderfully written. The show is complemented by multifaceted characters, witty and sarcastic banter, and a flawed but lovable heroine. I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters, especially Veronica, Logan, Weevil, Wallace, Lilly, Keith, and Mac. Characters that seem unlikable at first, like Dick, even started growing on me.<br /><br />I was devastated when they cancelled the show after only three seasons, but you can start watching this series without fear of being left hanging. There will be a movie coming out to give us Veronica Mars fans (Marshmallows) a semblance of closure, so I definitely recommend you start watching now. You will not regret it.
B00G32OER4|5.0|What caught our attention was the concept being a little bit different. I didn't expect the twist in victims. There were definitely some edge of the seat moments, even if no one was hiding their eyes. It is hard anymore to find a movie in this genre that commands attention, The Conjuring seemed to do exactly that. It grabbed us right at the start and didn't tarry, the story line began right away and carried throughout.

B006ICOK00|3.0|We just started the fourth segment of our year-long timelapse movie of our front yard, and boy is it fun to watch the resulting movies. The batteries last about three months, but there is no alarm or warning light on the camera to tell you when the battery is getting low, it's easy to miss a couple days' pictures.<br /><br />Also, the interface for the camera is so opaque that I am not sure whether I've got it running properly. After waiting 3 months for the second segment of the time lapse movie (spring), I discovered that it had not been taking pictures at all for that three months. That was very disappointing. The third segment (summer) came out fine, but I'm really not certain how to confirm whether it is taking pictures now. I'll have to wait till February to see if I did it right.

But on a moment's reflection, you'd remind yourself that elderly clients have concerns which pertain largely to them; everything from care contracts and equity release schemes to financial planning in retirement to funeral planning.<br /><br />How timely then, that Jordan Publishing has recently brought out `Elderly Clients: A Precedent Manual' in a new fourth edition.  Note that the editor, Denzil Lush, is the Senior Judge in the Court of Protection, ably assisted by co-editor Caroline Bielanska and five additional expert contributors.<br /><br />If you are a practitioner who regularly advises elderly clients you may already have a previous edition of this well established work. But in view of the many changes resulting from the case-law, especially in the areas of capacity, powers of attorney, and statutory wills, you do need this new edition in your professional library.<br /><br />As the editor points out, the chapter on carer and care worker services has been completely rewritten in the wake of regulatory changes to care homes implemented by the Care Quality Commission - only one example of the wealth of new material on offer.<br /><br />At the heart of the multiplicity of issues covered in this book are the problems involved in planning for a client's possible incapacity in later old age.  To this end, each chapter of this new edition has been extensively revised to encompass all major developments including capacity... care workers and care homes... regulatory changes following the SRA Handbook 2011... and Lasting Powers of Attorney.<br /><br />Not only does the book deal with the entire range of issues which affect the elderly client, it also provides the legal framework on which each area is based, supported throughout by checklists which, for example, will assist you in such matters as registering a lasting power of attorney and determining whether the best way forward for the client in specific circumstances is to make a will, or gift.<br /><br />A quick glance at the detailed Table of Contents (very useful this!) should be enough to convince you that this book is an essential purchase.  By way of introduction, the first two chapters deal mainly with `the client' and with client care.  In addition to the topics previously mentioned, there are chapters on, for example, sharing residential accommodation...social security agents and appointees...the various powers of attorney of course...and deputyship, as well as equity release<br /><br />Research resources abound, notably over thirty-two pages of tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and a table of abbreviations, plus a detailed index at the back. An impressive feature of this volume is the accompanying CD ROM which enables you to tailor each precedent to the particular needs of your client.<br /><br />Describing this authoritative and helpful work as `a valuable resource for elderly client practitioners' is indeed an understatement.  Here is a compact resource with everything you need to assist you in what will certainly become one of the more sensitive and difficult areas of your practice.area is based, supported throughout by checklists which, for example, will assist you in such matters as registering a lasting power of attorney and determining whether the best way forward for the client in specific circumstances is to make a will, or gift.<br /><br />A quick glance at the detailed Table of Contents (very useful this!) should be enough to convince you that this book is an essential purchase.

According to Burrows, Peter Birks' goal was for both volumes to be on `every English lawyer's desk as at least a first point of reference'.<br /><br />After having had a brief read of `English Private Law', we can't help adding that, in our view, this latest edition especially, should be on every lawyer's desk and not just English lawyers either.  Published recently by the Oxford University Press, this distinguished book (as well as its companion volume) will be of immense benefit to international lawyers as well especially those who seek a straightforward way to navigate the complexities of English law, both public and private.<br /><br />Public law, as the introduction explains, deals with  constitutional law, human rights, administrative law and criminal law.  Private law is concerned with those rights which, in the words of Birks, `a claimant can if necessary realize through the courts.'<br /><br />The book's logical structure certainly enhances the reader's understanding of private law.  Divided into five sections, it includes sources of law... the law of persons, property and obligations... and finally, litigation.  It is the section on litigation which includes a separate chapter on private international law, as well as judicial remedies and -- especially useful for the practitioner -- a chapter on civil procedure, including costs and enforcement.<br /><br />The book fulfills the need identified originally by Birks' to  provide an organised overview  to English private law; effectively a `map', in other words, to enable the more experienced and inexperienced lawyers alike to move confidently from one area of law to another'.<br /><br />Referring to the flood of information that became a deluge with the widespread use of the Internet in the early years of this century, the phenomenon of `information overload' was cited as one of the main reasons why, as Birks stressed, `it is becoming ever more essential that lawyers should `have a sound grip on the concepts and principles which hold the law together'.  Helping practitioners to secure that `sound grip' is what this book -- with its high standards of clarity and accessibility -- so admirably achieves.<br /><br />Over more than 1,500 pages, this volume contains the insights and specialist expertise of twenty-one learned contributors, mainly from Oxford and Cambridge as well as other distinguished institutions, from Bristol and Kings College London to Southampton, Singapore and McGill University in Canada.  For researchers, there are innumerable references in the footnotes and an astounding 164 pages containing tables of cases and of legislation, treaties and conventions.<br /><br />Further aids to quicker navigation, include a detailed table of contents and a 45-page index.  Also note that this new edition contains much new material which brings it thoroughly up to date.  It is fair to say that `English Private Law' is a distinguished, scholarly and thoroughly readable multi-authored work which no practitioner should be without.ide an organised overview  to English private law; effectively a `map', in other words, to enable the more experienced and inexperienced lawyers alike to move confidently from one area of law to another'.<br /><br />Referring to the flood of information that became a deluge with the widespread use of the Internet in the early years of this century, the phenomenon of `information overload' was cited as one of the main reasons why, as Birks stressed, `it is becoming ever more essential that lawyers should `have a sound grip on the concepts and principles which hold the law together'.

Here in one place, he adds, is a compendium of `authoritative guidance on the principles of damages for the busy practitioner'. He further describes it as `user-friendly' and so it is.<br /><br />The three authors - two barristers and a solicitor -- all experts in this area -- have created an indispensable work of reference.  Its clarity and practical, no-nonsense approach offer notable benefits for busy practitioners having to grapple with this complex and sensitive subject in order to do the best for their clients.<br /><br />The book covers the full spectrum of issues pertaining to damages including, for example, damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity... for loss of earnings... for gratuitous employment... for pension loss... for gratuitous care...  and of course much more.  Later chapters offer concise, authoritative guidance on housing... medical expenditure... mobility and transport... interest and benefits... and mental incapacity and the Court of Protection.<br /><br />The chapter on damages in respect of death covers claims on behalf of the estate and of dependents.  Issues relating to interim and periodical payments are also discussed. Each head of claim is accompanied by an explanation of the relevant law, practice and procedure -- and both evidence and procedure are covered in each chapter.<br /><br />Part of Jordan's series of APIL guides, this is the new third edition of a well-regarded work and contains much new material including new developments pertaining to future loss of earnings... capacity... provisional damages... and loss of chance.  For those doing further research, the book provides extensive footnoting, as well as tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments, plus two appendices and a detailed index at the back.<br /><br />If even a brief summary of the contents and scope of this book reminds you of the complexities that can emerge to confound you in your everyday practice in this area of law, you will certainly wish to add this latest edition of this highly regarded guide to your professional library.elopments pertaining to future loss of earnings... capacity... provisional damages... and loss of chance.

The latter of course, occasion that special form of dread in response to their complexity and often highly technical nature.  As Dingemans J notes in the Foreword, `suffering an injury at any time, let alone a catastrophic injury is bad enough, but suffering it abroad adds to the difficulties. And that is just the injury'<br /><br />The book certainly covers issues of jurisdiction and applicable law, as well as direct action against insurers, shipping and aviation claims and damages.  And there is more of course.  As the editor, Sarah Crowther, points out, the  scope of this title is not limited merely to `accidents' such as tripping, or vehicle collisions, or ski accidents.<br /><br />Crowther stresses that the principles discussed extend to clinical negligence illness claims, deliberate assaults and much more; all  involving personal injury and not just abroad. The book would also be applicable to events occurring in England and Wales which are subject to claims by those domiciled or resident elsewhere, or by foreign defendants domiciled, or resident in England and Wales<br /><br />There are two detailed chapters on Package Travel, including the liability of the tour operator to the consumer and the tour operator's rights against his suppliers.  Later chapters cover accidents at sea and travel by air, followed by practical advice on remedies and pleadings.  Clear and specific comment is supported throughout by precedents, as well as pleadings, relevant legislation and international materials.<br /><br />For those doing further research there is extensive footnoting, as well as tables of statutes and statutory instruments, as well as European and International materials. There are no less than six appendices which include Package Travel Regulations 1992 and the Montreal Convention 1999 as well as EC judgments and regulations.  The index at the back aids navigation as does the detailed Table of Contents.<br /><br />This practical work of reference should have pride of place in the professional library of every PI practitioner dealing with any personal injury claim which includes an international element.uropean and International materials.

B00102FELM|5.0|WOW...this has to be my favorite Scorpions concert DVD! 22 classic hits of Scorpions! I've been a long time Scorpions fan since I was a teen in the 80's, so of course all my favorites from the Scorpions were in the 80's and early 90's. This concert DVD was a treat to hear all the classics of that era! And Klause can still belt it out! I'm not sure about the fuss on production of this DVD. The picture was great, clear picture in widescreen and excellent sound, although I preferred PCM stereo over 5.1 surround here cause the guitars are heard better in PCM stereo. Yes, the filming has that MTV vibe but not as bad as most concert DVD's (like Evanescence \\"Anywhere But Home\\"). So this is a 5 star concert DVD of one of the biggest 80's hair metal bands still going strong with a running time of 2 hours and 19 minutes!

The storyline is not bad either. The problem is that the game is only a demo or intro to the full version. Need to pay in order to get the full version after the second chapter or so. The app should be listed as such.<br /><br />As with other reviews it is true that there is a long wait for the game to download and install.

B00E0SXNE8|3.0|While enjoyable, just how dumb can even a caveman dad be?  A bit too much slapstick &#34;neanderthal mentaility&#34; humor for my liking.  Kids enjoyed it though.  Not as much fun for adults.

B002KJX4IE|4.0|This is what made me a fan of Tim Burton years.  But if you've already seen &#34;The Nightmare Before Xmas&#34; and &#34;Corpse Bride&#34; you'll see nothing new here.  In fact, starting with this, then moving to &#34;Nightmare&#34; hearing the same music, the seeing the same themes, by &#34;Corpse Bride&#34; it was too predictable.  Lacks the polish of &#34;Nightmare&#34; and &#34;Corpse Bride&#34; but shows the beginning work of Tim Burton.  A novelty in its time, but this is not exactly timeless novelty.  Think cutesy Edgar Allen Poe.

B00F30S0Y0|5.0|If you are like many Arcade Fire fans, then you already know how amazing this album is. The album was posted on YouTube for streaming 5 days before its official release--a brilliant move, as it became a certain buy for me after a few playthoughs. However, if you are listening for the first time, note that Arcade Fire has definitely evolved since their previous effort. Though the album may not hit home on your first listen, subsequent session revealed something new, a hidden gem, a new favorite track. This is a testament to how much depth this album possesses. There are no fillers: even \\"Here Comes the Night Time II\\" serves a purpose as a transitional song into disc 2. The ambition of this album is simply astounding, covering a wide array of themes. It will mean something different to each individual listener, but I will say that this strives to heights not seen since Funeral.<br /><br />Personal highlights of the album for me include:<br />Reflektor - Producer James Murphy's impact is most evident here, as the sound is a hybrid of LCD Soundsystem and Arcade Fire. The single foreshadows the evolution of the band while remaining uniquely Arcade Fire.<br /><br />Here Comes the Night Time - A song inspired by inspired by their trip to Haiti, evident in both sound and lyrics. Full of tempo changes, the song can't help but make you feel the urge get up and dance.<br /><br />Normal Person - One of the most divisive songs on the album, manifested with Win's question \\"Do you even like Rock and Roll music?\\" Either you will love or hate this unabashed rock song.<br /><br />Joan of Arc - Caught my attention immediately with its hook, and remained fresh after many listens. A fitting tribute to the heroine.<br /><br />It's Never Over - Simply a beautiful song. Regine's echos at the end catapult this to one of the best tracks.<br /><br />Afterlife - A fitting climax to the album before the send off. This will be the favorite song for many listeners, myself included.<br /><br />This is the most well rounded Arcade Fire album to date, and I would rank it only behind Funeral in terms of overall quality. Arcade Fire has definitely evolved in a different direction, and for the better. The aspirations for Reflektor were incredibly high, and it has more than met it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|the first third-or-so is really slow (as some friends had warned me) but then I couldn't put it down - can't wait to get into the next one!

B0090XLDKY|5.0|One of my most favorite musicals! Great movie, great cast!!! This movie brings back great memories of me and my mom and her love of musicals,
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|Okay really though, this album is the best album I have ever bought. I have been excited for Dream Theater albums before, but this one takes the cake. I listened to this for near three weeks. Not a big deal, right? No, I mean JUST THIS. Then I started adding it to my playlists with other songs, and proceeded to skip to these songs. Only now am I actually okay with listening to other songs between them, but still highly anticipating these songs.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|This is my second favorite musical...I just had to find a copy, wonderful cast and great songs and storyline. Thoroughly enjpyable!!
0061537969|5.0|This book will honestly keep you engrossed for a long as you have the time to read it. Absolutely worth the price you will pay for it. I myself am a very picky reader (and more of a cat person) and this book got me sucked right in. I used every spare second I had reading this book, and not just skimming to get the major points like you can in some books, ACTUALLY READING EVERY WORD. Seriously, 5/5 would read and you should too.

B00FY9JJYA|3.0|Don't get me wrong.  Robert Glasper is a very talented guy, and so is his band.  But on THIS album?  I don't know if it's just me, but listen to this thing from the beginning to the end non-stop...and it will feel as if you're starting to hear the same song at certain stages.<br /><br />Robert didn't get very creative on this album in my opinion, gravitating to the same chord structure on too many songs.  That's very notable going from the song with Faith to Norah...and a few before even.  I started hearing the same chords repetitively and that becomes annoying with a guy of Robert's talent level...which leads me to believe this album was made mainly for the vocalists he assembled.<br /><br />This does not take away from the talent he was able to gather to compile this album, which makes it listenable.  Dwele, Erro, Lalah, Faith, and a few others really hit me nicely, but nothing I'd fall in love with like I did on Black Radio.<br /><br />I really wanted to hear more from the band itself which really showcases their overall talent as a group.  I case I feel for what he released could have been done by any good keyboard player and tight band.  It's material I've heard from other people in other ways...kind of a recycled sound.<br /><br />Other than that, for die-hard Robert Glasper fans who don't want to hear anything is wrong with this album, you won't find it.  But as someone who plays music, I just expected him to take this to another level.  He didn't.  He stayed safe on this album, which is fine for most people...I guess.<br /><br />I honestly see this album gaining traction on the live circuit so I look forward to the shows.  I don't regret buying though, because Casey KILLED that Bill Withers tune!!!!  The album still could have been better imo.<br /><br />Rock on RG!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I ordered this because I have been hearing all the hype about the Breaking Bad series.

0385351399|5.0|Mae Holland, a naive 24-year-old girl, with the help from her friend and fellow student Annie, is hired by The Circle, conquering the whole world company, some kind of corporation that combines Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, engaged in the implementation of social networks in everyday life. Mae grew up in a small unnamed town, and after graduation from thr university got a job at the factory to pay her student loans. But after two years Mae escapes from the factory and is happy to accept the job offer to work on the campus of The Circle.<br /><br />The company was founded by the three Wise Men, as they call themselves, Stenton, Bailey and Gospodinov, the latter rarely appears in public. In The Circle transparency, openness and communication are valued. Working on The Circle a person must not only perform their duties, but also to actively socialize, preferably on the Web. All information from Mae’s gadgets is transfered into her account in The Circle, later to be synchronized - all the new gadgets are linked to her Circle account.<br /><br />The Circle’s campus is a vast field, with numerous buildings, including dormitories for workers, hospitals, entertainment venues, shopping centres - in fact employees even don’t have to leave the campus, they can live and work here.<br /><br />Mae’s girlfriend Annie works at the top of the company, developing new projects, and Mae is to work in Customer Experience. May should help clients with the emerging issues, and for this they rate her help from one to one hundred in special survey.<br /><br />Eggers’ new novel had been called techno-thriller which is not true, of course. It's more tehnosatire, techno - because it’s technically accomplished, and because of new technologies. And the first quarter of the text reads as it is a serious thing , but after one scene where the main character gets punished by the boss and diligently corrects her own mistakes in the social network with the zeal of a madman - that's when you start to laugh, and at the same time realize that Eggers still show us his satirical talent.<br /><br />In The Circle the author made his protagonist not a fighter with the system, and not an intellectual, on the contrary - too sweet girl, who sees paradise anywhere after that factory. The desire to please, hold on, do not let her friend down, help parents with money – Mae’s motives are not bad, but they blurred her vision of the world. With every new page it’s more difficult for us to empathize with Mae, but the situation becomes clearer with The Circle.<br /><br />Eggers who does not use social media with striking accuracy caught in this novel our possession of pseudosocialization when activity in the social media substitutes activity in reality. The scenes of the novel, when Mae is brainwashed with a corporate culture are the strongest and most stunning.<br /><br />The figures of the three founders of The Circle can not be taken into account without laughing - their monologues, their concepts, their management companies. The more painful to see that Mae does not understand all that. Even when faced with obvious absurd situations, Mae can not see the absurdity of some aspect of The Circle and is trying to find a way within the corporate culture.<br /><br />The corporate part of the novel is succesful. But the general concept of warning is not quite complete. Eggers is trying to convince us about the global spread of The Circle, but the development of global social networks outside the United States are not well developed. It’s hardly possible to believe that people in third world countries or American vagrants would rush to buy electronic gadgets, cameras, and bracelets. Eggers also suffers crudity of some of his inventions: he tells about another novelty of The Circle, but then throws it away, forgetting to describe how it will work in the world and what changes it will bring.<br /><br />Another drawback of the book is that the point of view of theauthor, expressed through novel’s antagonists Mercer and Kalden, is too roughly woven into the text. Mae’s position is presented to us in the form of a narrative, whereas the position of the author in the form of not too convincing lectures and sermons. If the author's purpose - to show, not to tell, then Eggers tells in antagonists’ monologues.<br /><br />The Circle has turned out an uneven novel, but funny and entertaining. The author warns us about the danger of the influence of social media, but where will readers rush to share the warnings if not on Facebook and Twitter ? The Circle is completed?

B00DIJQAI6|5.0|I LOVE this game. Needs more characters though. Please add Amy Rose, Alex Kidd, Nights (the purple Jester-like guy), Metal Sonic, Blaze the Cat, Wreck-It Ralph (he appeared in Sonic Racing Transformed), and don't forget all the other characters owned by SEGA. But don't add Big the Cat. He's TERRIBLE. I hate Big the Cat. Other than that, great game. I will definitely be coming back for more!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Book was recommended to me had a hard time getting interested at first as I read more really  Liked it couldn't put it away a lot of different  suspects just when you think you have it figured out then you get surprised again will  read more books by this author.  Keeps you interested
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have an apple TV, have used Roku and have just about every streaming option available through TV's and Blue Ray devices. I was interested in this because it seems so simple, and it is. If you happen to be cruising around YouTube and see a video you like you can simply press the cast button and &#34;Bam&#34; it's on your TV. This is awesome, and if your using an HDMI control as the input it will take over and automatically change to that HDMI channel. Netflix casting was flawless and worked amazingly well, as is usually the case with Nefflix offerings.<br /><br />Casting from the computer using a browser was actually quite good, and with a stutter here and there it was very manageable. The option have a cast option in Chrome is just convenient, because sometimes you want to share something quickly without having to change inputs, change audio, hook up and HDMI cable and generally waste time. It's just quicker.<br /><br />The only drawback is content, as of now you get Youtube, Netflix, Hulu on a Tablet and Chrome casting on your PC. I think of this as a cheap investment because it does look like the rest of the market is starting to push content to the Chromecast, and I think it will expand rapidly when they get their API's down.<br /><br />Overall a great device, not an apple TV killer but a fast alternative to stream content when you want to rapidly.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It works well, but I'm not completely satisfied, I expected more of this product does not work without wifi connection, it should be easier operation and connection.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I honestly didn't know how I was going to react to this mainly because I have never finished a Neil Gaiman book (I know, blasphemy!). But, I have to say that I really enjoyed reading this.<br /><br />First, for an adult fantasy book, the protagonist is a child and Neil Gaiman does a wonderful job of portraying the story from a child's point of view. There are some moments in the book (I don't want to write spoilers) where the content is really \\"adult\\" and we, as readers, are able to pick up on it based on the innocent observation of our main character. I think that alone speaks for Neil's writing abilities.<br /><br />As for the book itself, it is really short and it's really engrossing. I started reading it out of guilt (since I have a stack of books that I've been neglecting due to studying and other obligations) and I couldn't put it down until I was done reading. It is extremely well-written and it's very easy to get lost in his words and the story that he tells. The best part is that, even though this book is fantasy, it doesn't shove the fantasy elements into your face (does that make sense!?) which I love since fantasy is one of the harder genres to get into since you have to familiarize yourself with the world first.<br /><br />The ending was very bittersweet. Our protagonist returns to his homeland and all the events that are related to his adventure is given \\"adult\\" explanations that make perfect sense. He goes to see Lettie (I am holding back tears and resisting the urge to rant) and, while reading, I swear I was about to cry and not for a good reason. Personally, I thought that Neil Gaiman picked a perfect ending. Granted it's not your typical happily-ever-after but I thought that it suited the story very well.<br /><br />I had to chop off half a star though mainly because I thought the way the climax was handled was way too convenient. I personally hated the antagonist and thought that she was a perfect villain and the way that she was ultimately defeated and how the story ended disappointed me.<br /><br />Overall, a great book to read and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read it. Best of all, it's in a small, digestible chunk so you can be sure that you won't have to wait long to finish it.<br /><br />Review originally posted at [...]ed and how the story ended disappointed me.<br /><br />Overall, a great book to read and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read it.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a great book. I found myself thinking  about the characters when I wasn't reading and speculating how it would end. The author imparts wisdom on the nature of marriage, maturity and life in general through her well crafted character. Highly recommended!
1451532512|5.0|I love this book so much! I am a huge Shakespere fan and love all of his works. I bought this as a textbook (because my Complete Shakespere Collection was too heavy to carry around school) and loved it even more after class dicusssion.

B00E1ZIZ3O|4.0|Like an amazing body of work seen through a prism, this collection of covers breathes new life into PG's classics. Not every cover feels inspired, but if nothing else they make you want to head back to the original to remember why you loved it so much. It is a matter of taste which versions you dig the most here, and I found Bon Iver's \\"Come Talk to Me\\" to be the most brilliant conversion, as his falsetto and ethereal production really lend themselves to an already amazing song. Definitely pick up the double cd Scratch My Back/And I'll Scratch Yours if you haven't purchased either one- it's a journey.
B000002O4X|5.0|I love this movie and I love the soundtrack even more. It provides so much drama to the movie and suppliments it well.

B0029O08WA|4.0|The soundtrack to the movie is actually quite nice. It is very modern and flows with the movie very nicely.
1449305172|5.0|There are numerous books and articles at this point on Lean Startup practices and philosophy. I've read many. What distinguishes Ash's approach in this book is practical, street-level view of the process. How do you get to talk with a potential customer? What do you ask for? How do keep track of interview results? How do you quantify that data so that it can guide you to the best business decision? All these critical questions are answered.<br /><br />As a mentor, I insist that anyone whom I advise read this book. It's simply the most concise and most helpful book out there on this topic.<br /><br />We are all looking forward to hearing more from Ash Maurya!

B006CQ89UE|4.0|For the most part, this is a well directed and edited documentary about an incredible career. My only disappointment is that they fell into the trap of repeating the incorrect (yet often quoted \\"fact\\") that \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is Woody Allen's biggest box office success. If you adjust for inflation, \\"Midnight in Paris\\" doesn't come anywhere near the giant hits that were \\"Annie Hall\\" and \\"Manhattan.\\"

1449305172|5.0|A great book to read, is a step by step process that will guide you how to think about your product idea and how to build on it to get to the point when you can actually start offering your product to customers. When you get there it will point you some key things you should monitor to maximise value from customer feedback and behaviours and use it for your benefit.<br />It's also great book to have after your read it because you will get back to it every now and then for more tips or to check if you're on the right track.<br />I strongly recommend this book to ane person who is thinking about launching start-up.

Running Lean is the practical implementation of an iterative methodological way to turn a start-up company into a sustainable business.<br />El libro de Ash Maurya significa un hito en la literatura práctica de entrepreneurship.

B00BKBCF38|5.0|I could care less if this doesn't fit your definition of \\"Metal\\" music, but to me it IS Metal. Furthermore I recommend this album to any true Metal fan out there with an open mind and who doesn't get sucked in by \\"labels\\". I love Metal, but I don't live in a box and limit myself to listening only to bands that play fifty drum beats per second and the vocalist sings like Cookie Monster in every song. That's fine, I can dig that kind of \\"Metal\\" too (In small doses). Nothing wrong with the Hard Core bands. All I'm saying is- don't get hung up on the fact that this album and it's predecessor (Opus Eponymous) are a slightly different kind of \\"Heavy Metal\\" that harkens back to the early day's before the term \\"Metal\\" was even coined. These guys are freaking awesome and you are doing an injustice to yourself if you ignore their music.<br /><br />Ok, so about the whole \\"Satanic\\" aspect...The first album \\"Opus Eponymous\\" is a whole lot about the devil, concepts of evil, etc...etc., more importantly we are introduced to some vile power that is intent on taking over the world somehow and the conception of the Anti-Christ begins with the first album.(Not actually a concept album, just kind of worked out that way). This album, \\"Infestissumam\\", continues the \\"story\\" and it heralds the arrival of the Anti-Christ here on Earth, living among us, calling the world to him. (I'm pretty sure the Catholic Church thinks these guys ARE the \\"anti-Christ\\"). No matter what you believe in, these guys come off to me as pretty  tongue-in-cheek and yet esoteric with the satanic theatrics.(like dressing up as the \\"Black Pope\\" and a group of monks) I doubt they are the devil incarnate (but I can't rule it out either). All I know is some of the songs lyrics can really mess with your head. Listening to a Ghost album is like watching \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" or some other creepy movie that involves the devil and religion...but it's only a show people, all in fun and done to entertain you, nothing more. And these guys do entertain, there's nothing boring here. Check them out, join the growing masses who are already swaying to the sound of the Monstrance Clock.

0804137501|5.0|Remote working can be pretty intimidating if you've never tried it before. How do you know if people are doing what they should be doing? Won't my employees just slack off? Surely my business won't ever be creative if we can't collaborate in person.<br /><br />REMOTE answers all these questions and more. Jason and David delve into how they do remote work at 37Signals and also include anecdotes and data from how other companies, both big and small, do it too. You'll learn how to hire, what tools to use, things that matter and things that don't when building a remote team.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite part is how to manage a remote team. The curtains are unveiled in REMOTE and what you learn is that managing REMOTE employees is a lot like how you should manage any employee, it's just most companies do management wrong no matter how the team is setup.<br /><br />For those reasons, I'd recommend REMOTE to people looking into remote working and also those trying to learn how to manage a team, whether it's remote or not.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|This is the perfect follow-up to reading Eric Reis' [[ASIN:0307887898 The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses]]. While Eric's book gave a good overview and plenty of examples of the lean startup in action, I enjoyed Ash's straight-forward, practical advice for putting into action for your own business and products.<br /><br />The lean canvas tied a lot of concepts together for me, and I enjoy that the process is a matter of spending under 20 minutes on your business model, which gives you the liberty to iterate and try out different models.<br /><br />I look forward to any future books that Ash writes.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Disappointing.  Not the same level of intensity I'm used to in these movies.  A sad attempt at a father-son redemption theme.

0739321005|4.0|I listend to the audio version of the book read by Barack Obama himself. I had no idea he was so talented - I could easily imagine each and every character of the story thanks to his acting abilities. I learned a lot about the way people live in Africa and although some of the customs I could never relate to, it was obvious that family, hospitality and desire to do best are important things to them just as they are everywhere else in the world. One particular example of how Africans care about each other at the very end made me tear up: as Barack was standing over his father's grave, deep in thoughts, it started to rain and someone from his family run up to him, trying to fit both himself and \\"Barry\\" as they called him, under an umbrella. \\"We just wanted to make sure you are okay!\\" he told Barack.<br />It was a very inspiring read, touching and humbling.
1476727651|5.0|The book is a follow up to &#34;The Shining&#34; which was the first book of his I read at the request of a friend who got it at the library.  I immediately became a Stephen King follower and proceeded to read his books he had written before that one and have never missed one since.  This could very well be the very best of the lot.  I am only half way through due to lack of reading time but have a tough time putting it down.
B00D48BSBA|5.0|I read this book thanks to the e-edition released on Kindle. Much to the credit of the septuagenarian author, the book remains relevant to the present world, where the word terrorism has metamorphosed into a new meanings . Even though the author likes to use pseudonyms ever so often, the suspense is taut and you rarely loose the plot. The details with which war trenched Djibouti and Somalia are depicted makes you visualize everything so vividly as if the author was himself on the receiving end of such hostilities. To carry on with such aplomb surely makes Mr Forsythe my favorite fiction writers of all time.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|This was a very interesting peek into someone who has been kidnapped and locked up. I love Ma and what an incredible job she did with her son, Jack, in such horrid conditions. I also loved that everything wasn't perfect and rosy once they escape. This book sure isn't sunny, but it's heartwrenching and thought provoking. It shows real emotions of fear, hate, frustration and no sugar coating. I intented this book as a full weekend read but finished it in one day. I just had to know the end. The book is written mostly from the perspective of the 5 year old. Some had issues with his grammar, but he's 5, so I find their annoyance with it unreasonable. It really isn't all that bad at all.

B00FFVLYTU|5.0|Set on the U.K.'s wind-buffeted Dorset coast (filmed in Clevedon), ITV's &#34;Broadchurch&#34; is a mystery series that deeply engages the audience. The narrative follows the loss and trauma following the murder of a young boy, and the search for his killer. Thankfully, for fans who faithfully followed this compelling show, &#34;Broadchurch&#34; will be returning for a second series in 2014! When &#34;Broadchurch&#34; was originally transmitted in the U.K., viewership grew so much that by the series conclusion, the producers and writers (who had only intended one series) were compelled to continue.<br /><br />Series One begins on a hazy summer morning along the lovely Dorset coastline, during the tourist season. An 11 year old boy, Danny Latimer (Oskar McNamara), goes missing. His mother, awoken with nightmares in the wee hours, desperately searches for her son. Later in the day, his body is discovered below the white cliffs. The mystery involves an entire community, exploring bonds of trust that are tested and broken. The remarkable cast makes &#34;Broadchurch&#34; standout. David Tennant is one of the best actors out there; as Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, he brings an award-winning level of intensity and nuance to the part. DI Hardy, buffeted by life, takes this case after barely surviving the ensuing scandal when a previous case was bungled; the victim's parents continue to blame him for the failure. Viewers learn that there is more to his past, and tragedy drives Hardy to solve this new case, despite its effect on his frail health.<br /><br />Olivia Colman is Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller; she lost out on a promotion to newcomer DI Hardy. She is a good friend to Danny's mother, Beth Latimer (the superb Jodie Whittaker is utterly convincing), and her young son Tom (Adam Wilson) was apparently Danny's friend. Wrestling with grief, Beth Latimer discovers she is pregnant with her third child, a situation all the more tumultuous after she discovers that her husband Mark (Andrew Buchan) has been having an affair with Becca Fisher (Simone McAullay). Becca works at the hotel where DI Hardy is staying. Beth turns to her vicar, the Reverend Paul Coates (Arthur Darvill, glad to see he survived a thankless role in &#34;Doctor Who&#34;), for solace. Beth's frail faith is shaken to the core by the loss of her son, his absence is palpable.<br /><br />DS Ellie Miller's husband, Joe (Matthew Gravelle), seems to be oblivious to their son's problems, while trying to support his wife. DS Miller dislikes DI Hardy and his cynicism, and finds the investigation of her community quite difficult to cope with. An unsavory element is the muckraking of journalists. The editor of the local paper, Maggie Radcliffe (Carolyn Pickles), attempts to control junior reporter Olly Stevens (Jonathan Bailey); he is Ellie's nephew. Jack Marshall (the superb David Bradley, of &#34;Harry Potter&#34;) faces terrible accusations when his past is unearthed; the actor David Bradley should be far better known. Another suspect, Susan Wright (Pauline Quirke is perfect) menaces Maggie one evening at the paper. Susan lives on the beach in a trailer, and knows more than she lets on. She has strange relationship with plumber Tom Latimer's employee Nigel Carter (Joe Sims), and Nigel threatens her with a crossbow. Throughout, it appears Danny may have been blackmailing people; there is an undertow of darkness in Broadchurch.<br /><br />No matter how surrounded he is by coworkers and the community Broadchurch suspects, Detective Inspector Alec Hardy is dreadfully alone. Just as Broadchurch's cliffs drop dramatically to the sea, where water meets land and sky in sharp delineation, his soul seems on the cusp of a precipitous fall. Aside from a fine cast overall, the show's momentum is provided by its leads. David Tennant as DI Hardy inhabits the character from the inside out. Tennant, a remarkable actor, conveys a soul tormented by immense pressure, a storm within and without.Olivia Colman is superb as DS Ellie Miller, she summons up a world of pain that is harrowing and remarkable to behold. The last scene, with beacons of torchlight and bonfires shimmering in the darkness along the coast, and Beth seeing Danny's ghost, is deeply evocative. Enjoy.Olivia Colman is superb as DS Ellie Miller, she summons up a world of pain that is harrowing and remarkable to behold.

B00CATSONE|5.0|loved reading about Mr Tesla. I am incredibly inspired and now plan to go and develop music that heals people with cancer.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|it´s a good watch if you want a cheap, simple, and &#34;don´t worry&#34; one. It´s a little bit thick, but still is nice.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|Granted the acting is very borderline, but there's enough heart and special effects in this movie to make it fun to watch.
B00EUVG3P6|5.0|So, I put together a server system (yeah, most everyone reading this is building a standard desktop--sorry, this won't be the most useful review for you) that featured a SuperMicro X10SLM+-F-O motherboard.  That board is intended for one of the more hardcore Xeon's, but I thought I'd try this anyway, since it was less than half the price, and my needs were modest.<br /><br />Holy cow!  When I totally saturate my FreeNAS system on 1Gbps ethernet, this thing doesn't even break a sweat.  I think the most CPU usage I've read so far on my file server was something like 25% on the two cores, each.  This seems like an exceptionally potent CPU on a per dollar basis.  This is a slam dunk for any kind of light to moderate usage.  For a HTPC box, or a web browsing/word processing box, this is ***MORE*** than enough.  I doubt you'll want to rip .mp4 videos from .vobs using this, or play games on max settings, but other than that, I think you're getting a tremendous bang per buck.<br /><br />I'd buy this without hesitation for any kind of routine usage computer.  Looks to be about the same as one of the new AMD A6 Richlands, roughly.
B00003CWOL|5.0|I just wonder where I was when this movie came out. I just saw it recently on cable and had to own it. Very funny with very adult language. It handles the concept of God and religion flawlessly. A well-thought-out and brilliantly executed movie.The actors were well cast and top notch.The perfect movie.
B004P1JDJO|3.0|The book presents some good ideas but after doing so it beats them to death with the last few chapters.
0061150142|5.0|This is Jodi's best (so far, I've read 4 of her novels)and I am captivated as to how in the world does she do her research? She says that she LOVES the research part of writing, and I believe her. Her research is so good that she would HAVE to love it. On this one, how she was able to write so accurately what happens in the courtroom is unbelievable. The trial of Chris Harte is amazing!! This is a must read for anyone who really enjoys a GREAT BOOK.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|With the passing of Jordan one would wonder how anyone could even begin to contemplate the task of completing his masterpiece. Sanderson rode to the last battle and won.
B00026ZG10|5.0|Came in good condition.  I like this movie, it's one of my favourite spy movies.  I recommend it.  It's a good movie.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Deff a good game passes time well play with friends from Facebook and new friends u make while playing if you don't like the ads you can pay 2 dollars and have it ad free I recommend this game to anyone that likes card games ......download it now and add me as a friend
B00D37UQ1K|2.0|That really is not my only problem a big part of the book is the struggle between the two main characters, Melanie and Wanderer.  You never really saw that internal battle.  There was little to no character development and everyone was pretty much dimension and beyond flat.  There was no journey for any of the characters they hate and love from one scene to the next with no transition.  Real life doesn't play out this way, putting a very false note to the relationships, basically they come off as completely  unbelievable.  I am flabbergasted the author allowed her name to be put on this movie and script it is so far from what her storyline was.<br /><br />I am tremendously disappointed.  Would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Best book ever awesome series I really love these books I can't believe the flare was man made AHHHHHHH to many people die
B009UX2YAC|5.0|People keep saying there is a virus in the game not true had it for two years not a problem all ages will love this when it gets fast it's a bit harder but who cares it's fun don't listen to other bad reviews it doesn't even need internet the  game glitches once in a month it's free to save up to get cool people

B006JRY2QG|5.0|Not 1 dull moment.  The acting is superb.  I love it! I’ve also noticed only lately has it gotten any coverage in the “entertainment mags”.  Only because JAX is up for a juicy role.  Anyway, I’m glad I found it on amazon Prime!!!
B005LN5UOC|3.0|Not the best audio quality but for the price it works. Battery life deteriorates over time if it is used for hours and hours a day. Which is obviously expected.
B0049GYXDQ|1.0|I am extremely disappointed in the product I received! I purchased the combo used, but the seller promised it was in \\"very good condition.\\" I took the case out of the Amazon packaging and immediately noticed that the cover labels were damaged, but was not too worried because it's just the case labels. I then took out the DVD and put it in our player. It was already skipping in the opening scenes! I assumed it was dirty and when I took it out to clean, I noticed it was covered in large scratches. The divets were deep enough to feel with your finger. I removed the Blu-ray to check its quality and immediately noticed a fingertip-size dent! I don't even know how you can dent a Blu-ray. I will NEVER purchase from this seller again.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My husband loves the quality of the movies and the case they come in is adorable. How could you not want to buy these? IT'S STAR WARS!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book ruins the trilogy! The first two books are fabulous! The author made this part of the story too wordy and politically oriented. Word of advice to the author, ALWAYS stick with a happy ending.
B006IMY5ZU|3.0|per say but still an enjoyable movie. I'm one of the few guys that openly admits being a Brad Pitt fan and being so means ill watch just about anything he does. I mean I even sat through Seven years in Tibet! In short, worth a watch if you haven't already seen it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game requires a guide.Especially if you never played this version. There is red stone which disapears when you mine it no matter what pickaxe you use. The difficulty gauge will let you pick difficult or easy and nothing in between. Even though I have the guide(bought that too.)I am unable to do the nether spire. I hope the future updates make it better.There is also no map.
B00DM0UTPQ|3.0|just to see Mulder on a submarine. Duchovny is one of those actors that i'll watch in just about anything.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Amazing but ripped my soul out. I love the Divergent series but the end of Allegiant killed me. No more spoilers from me. Just get the book. It's still really good even though I am grieving.
B00DQVST76|5.0|My cousin appears twice on this DVD!  An especially good part is when she performs a hybrid of Born This Way/Express Yourself
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game challenged my mind and caused me to think a lot more than I have been thinking lately. Good game! Everybody needs to do something like that every so often.<br />Sgtdvs 13
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|This album is great from start to finish.  Some of my personal favorite tracks are Favorite Scars, Red, Pride, You Haven't Seen The Last of Me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game and very addictive to can never leave the game so many head aches and fights with the husband about me staying on the game
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I'd read the other two Bridget Jones books so decided to finish the trio. I was fine with the direction the author took regarding Mark Darcy because it gave Bridget another obstacle to tackle, but as with some of the other reviewers, it would have been nice to see Bridget 'grow up' a bit, considering she's now 51. But that didn't bother me too much because I was expecting a light, breezy read, and that's what I got. Some parts dragged on too long, particularly the constant tweeting and text messaging back and forth, but overall a fun read. Delivered what I expected it to.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I find it perfect for mobile streaming. The only thing missing is the open sdk for developers to create apps for it.
1451666179|5.0|This book is about 50% new material, and 50% material from her blog. It's well worth the price. Extremely funny.

B00499QUK2|5.0|There are 3 shows included jn Season 1.  They are the length of a movie.  I receive the season on Netflix and Amazon Prime with my subscription but loved it so much I bought the season separately from Amazon.  I’ve watched it many, many times.  I adore all the characters including Moriarity who is the villain to hate.  All the characters, Sherlock, Dr. Watson, Mrs. Hobson, Detectives Lestrade, Molloy Hopper and Mycroft are brilliant and provide a star performance.  What a great team of actors!  The story plots are intricate and hold many surprises. The shows are also quite sidewise humorous.My favorite episode in Season 1 is “Study in Pink.”
B006LSZECO|4.0|A wicked psychological suspense thriller!  It will keep you reading long into the night.  I did n't like the ending though.
0525478817|5.0|The love story between cancer patients Hazel and Augustus is filled with both tragedy and laughter. Their journey together is consumed with illness, making their situation dire. Through a trip to Amsterdam, the two are able to find a kind of love every young girl longs for. Upon meeting the beloved author of their favorite book, their high expectations are ruined, leaving many unanswered questions. After a sudden devastating discovery their relationship is forever altered. Hazel most turn to the man she despises most in order to find closure. Together Hazel and Gus are forced to live out their fates as side affects to dying.<br />John Green magnifies his readers with the admirable love story between Hazel and Augustus. By far my favorite book, The Fault in Our Stars depicts the perfect meaning of determining your own fate and answering the philosophical question of whether or not it is in our control.
B008Y70TMK|5.0|Not sure why this is offered in HD - there didn't seem to be any HD features to this version. But otherwise this is a great classic comedy.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a good read. It reminded me a bit of &#34;The Stand&#34; which I read a long time ago. I was glad to see what happened to the characters from &#34;the Shining.&#34; There was much less foul language, something that I did not enjoy in past Stephen King novels. I did very much appreciate that.
1451666179|5.0|When I first discovered Allie Brosh's blog I read every single entry over two evenings. I would have stayed up all night and read it one sitting, but I wore myself out laughing. Her cartoon stories are hilarious in the strangest way. You start to read, get hooked, and then find yourself weeping with laughter sputtering something like, \\"Kenny Loggins!\\" or \\"wolves!\\"This book includes her best stories, but it goes way beyond, exploring her relationship with her family and fiancé and her experiences with depression and self-doubt. I hope Allie Brosh keeps blogging, keeps writing, and keeps making sense out of the ridiculous.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I did not get the usual Stephen King character development.  I had to try hard to remember who was who, and I'm only 50% through the book.  It is scary, all right, but does not hit home like the books set in 1958, and maybe that is just because I was born in 1952.  It felt like there was another writer's influence on Dr. King.  He is the man when it comes to books for the baby boomerszzzzzzzzzzzzzzz1  Excuse the extra Z's.  Best regards, I did buy the electronic version of the book and it is definitely scary, but just too many characters who are elusive.

0062082841|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo30NUAR42E04U5]]If you've followed the career of director Guillermo del Toro, you no doubt have an admiration for his films.  On the whole, some films are more successful than others - but they all have great design work.  In particular, his films are known for their abundance of creatures (some elegant, others terrifying).<br /><br />We get personal artwork from every film that Mr. del Toro has directed - \\"Cronos\\", \\"Mimic\\", \\"The Devil's Backbone\\", \\"Blade II\\", \\"Hellboy\\", \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\", and \\"Pacific Rim\\".  Most of these are early drawings, sketches, and storyboards - and some of it differs greatly from what appears in the finished film.  There are also full-page scans from del Toro's idea journals, which includes extensive writing in both English and Spanish.  I am so glad that this artwork has been made available, it shows how much time and effort goes into the designs of these movies.<br /><br />Del Toro has been attached to dozens of projects, yet he has only made 8 films.  So there's a lot of work that has yet to make it to the screen - fortunately, we also get a few pages of designs from some of these unfinished projects, such as \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" and \\"Meat Market\\".<br /><br />By far the best and most numerous designs come from \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" and the two \\"Hellboy\\" movies... a lot of the book's real estate is dedicated to those films.  In terms of disappointments, I would have liked to have seen more from \\"Pacific Rim\\" - there are about 10 pages or so on that movie, but oddly there are no Jaeger or Kaiju drawings.<br /><br />What's NOT included in the book: most notably, del Toro spent 2+ years working on pre-production of \\"The Hobbit\\" before leaving the project.  As a fan, I would have loved to see some of his artwork from Middle-Earth.  Also, del Toro has overseen various Dreamworks Animation projects, like \\"Rise of the Guardians\\" and \\"Kung Fu Panda 2\\".  I'm not sure how hands-on his involvement with those films was, but its hard to imagine he didn't sketch out something for those movies.<br /><br />There are a number of notable individuals who author pages discussing their friendship/collaboration with Guillermo del Toro:<br />James Cameron - director of \\"Titanic\\" & \\"Avatar\\"; writes the book's Foreword.<br />Alfonso Cuaron - acclaimed director of \\"Children of Men\\" & \\"Gravity\\", longtime friend of del Toro.<br />Mike Mignola - artist and writer of Hellboy<br />Ron Perlman - actor who has appeared in many of del Toro's movies<br />Tom Cruise - was set to star in del Toro's film \\"Mountains of Madness\\"; writes the book's Afterword.<br /><br />We also get an extensive interview with del Toro, and photographs from his Bleak House (an entire house full of horror artifacts, models, and artwork that inspire him).those films was, but its hard to imagine he didn't sketch out something for those movies.<br /><br />There are a number of notable individuals who author pages discussing their friendship/collaboration with Guillermo del Toro:<br />James Cameron - director of \\"Titanic\\" & \\"Avatar\\"; writes the book's Foreword.<br />Alfonso Cuaron - acclaimed director of \\"Children of Men\\" & \\"Gravity\\", longtime friend of del Toro.<br />Mike Mignola - artist and writer of Hellboy<br />Ron Perlman - actor who has appeared in many of del Toro's movies<br />Tom Cruise - was set to star in del Toro's film \\"Mountains of Madness\\"; writes the book's Afterword.<br /><br />We also get an extensive interview with del Toro, and photographs from his Bleak House (an entire house full of horror artifacts, models, and artwork that inspire him).

B00ELOOYZI|4.0|I have purchased games from the developer Jundroo, LLC before, Notably [[ASIN:B007TML4EI Dummy Defense]] and loved it. When this Simple Rockets game was offered as free app of the day I gladly accepted as I knew it will be good. Boy I was right! It is very clear that the developer was very passionate in developing this app and it shows in the game design.<br /><br />I love the tutorials included in the game. This app will definitely inspire anyone who loves rockets & or would like to visit space someday in the future. Even for causal gamer this app has tons of challenges to offer. Try the game and see it yourself it is very well crafted. Physics are very realistic and I like the menu and presentation.<br /><br />There are no unwanted modules, no spyware, no IAP, no analytics other than some links to developers own games. The application is slightly old version but that is always the case with Amazon appstore, patiently wait for few weeks and it will get updated.<br /><br />EDIT: (Problem below lowered this to four stars!)<br />-----<br />Just noticed that if you pause the game and switch to other apps using 'recent tasks' the game still runs in the background (40+Mb) which normal but was seen to consume battery as if it is actively running (Jelly Bean 4.2.1 running on [[ASIN:B00E0EY7Z6 ASUS MeMOPad HD 7-Inch ]] even when the device has been put in standby mode. This could be a problem wherein it might completely drain your device battery. This problem is not seen when you gracefully exit the application using menus or kill the application using task killer. If developer is reading this please make sure that the app goes to proper sleep when not actively played and or if the Android device is in standby.<br /><br />Four stars! for a well crafted physics app that inspires everyone! - Kudos to the developer!
B001E7EONC|3.0|True story, I was surprised to find out in the end. The bad guys usually go to jail. Surprise ending.
B009V0TV6O|3.0|A little confusing to start.  Works well. I like the ease of changing the options quickly and easily.  I would recommend it.
B004HW7JMO|2.0|As much as I like the entire series, I won't be buying this over-priced shortened mid season release.  Somebody needs to re-evaluate the entertainment value/price point on this product.
B000006YXV|5.0|Discovered this great artist sooooo late! What a sincere voice.  What incredible vocals.  The way he sings it is as he is plunging into an other world of want, joy, love, affection, and sadness.  Fantastic artist!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The books are in great detail. It help so much when watching the series on television. It made me understand things.
B00932A4XE|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but it was very fun! Lots of big name actors and lots of different pregnancy experiences are presented.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|i'm a comic geek and that is the only reason for the purchase. It's not a great movie by any means. Go buy a Marvel movie.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|First off,i dont need a bunch of critics to tell me if a movie is good or not.I dont subscribe to the trendy channel.I didnt have very high expectaions of this movie.I figured it would be your typical unecessary use of lanuage and big cinema tactics.The discovery i made is its actually a very decent movie with a solid plot and has a nice human element to it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Loved the original, and love this one as well. Not a Trekkie by any means, but this is good film.
B002P79KAC|5.0|This show is so funny with plenty of intelligent humor.  We have tried to find a comedy that isn't completely perverted and this pretty much works for us.  Every once in a while they push the limit, but it isn't the overall theme of the show.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and hate it at the same time. I'm soooo hooked I can't stop playing it. I have it on my phone and on my Kindle so that when the kids are playing on one device I'm playing on the other :) awesome game
B007SO31BQ|5.0|If you love racing, or drama then this movie is for you. It is exciting and sad, but the intrigue of Ayrton and the atmosphere of F1 racing is a combination you'll remember.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|If you liked the first three, you will enjoy this one. They need to bring back Emilio Estevez some how.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Considering the limitations for apps to play content on your laptop or your TV, having this in your home makes your phone or tablet a very powerful media hub. I love it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|No where does it tell you this thing is not any good with android tablets. So after I bought one anticipating lots of pleasure, it sits in a drawer while I am out $35.
B00E9P957Q|3.0|The remastered discs sound incredible, especially \\"Presto\\", and \\"Roll the Bones\\". \\"Vapor Trails\\" is like an entirely new album. Breathtaking. So musically, this set delivers. And, for the most part that is all that matters.<br />However, I am a major Rush geek and I have to complain about what a let down the packaging was. After the \\"Sector\\" sets, I was expecting more brilliance. Instead, what we get is one booklet with all of the lyrics, and not much else.<br />The album covers are in-tact, as is any of the back artwork. However, gone are the beautiful graphics inside the booklets, and there are none of the original liner notes here. No band photos, no hands and fists, no elephants, no counterparts, no wolfs or trains or dogs named Limbo, no tarot cards, no cars driving into the sunset or snakes with gag arrow hats on their heads. No, I'm afraid this is just the bare minimal. In fact, if not for the back of \\"Feedback\\", you wouldn't even know who was in this band. Gone is also the production details and the credits, as well. So no, the artwork is not faithful to the original. Quite the opposite. Which is a shame, because, as I said, the \\"Sector\\" sets were dazzling.<br /><br />Anyhow, that was just my two cents.
0307454568|5.0|I loved the trilogy. Great suspense and I loved rooting for the underdog girl. Hard to follow the foreign names let alone pronounce them but I got over that and thoroughly enjoyed the whole series. Too bad we lost an outstanding author.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|This is a very special Christmas album.  First and foremost is Susan Boyle's crystal clear voice; she is at her best on this album.<br /><br />The songs are a great selection, many of which we have grown up with and some which may be new to some of us.<br />Susan Boyle gives a unique rendering of each song and makes it her own.<br /><br />O Come All Ye Faithful, a duet with Elvis, is magnificent.  The next, Susan Boyle's rendition of The Lord's Prayer, is exquisite.<br /><br />I particularly love I'll Be Home for Christmas, The Christmas Song, and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas - all of which bring back years of memories but each made special by Susan Boyle.<br /><br />The duet with Johnny Mathis, &#34;When a Child Is Born&#34;, is excellent.  It was a wonderful choice to have Johnny Mathis on this album.<br /><br />Miracle Hymn, the last song on the album, is from The Christmas Candle movie out Nov. 22 in which Susan Boyle makes her movie debut.  It is a beautiful new hymn written for her.<br /><br />Every year there are many new Christmas albums, but as I said above, this one is special and anyone who purchases it is sure to be more than pleased.<br /><br />These 12 songs are guaranteed to touch and warm your heart.
1594135851|5.0|Loved the whole series. It's kind of a kids book, but once I got into the story, I couldn't put it down wondering what would befall our heroin next.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|I'll be honest...I skipped Sleep Through the Static and To the Sea because they really lacked the kind of songs that I wanted to hear often.  I'd liken this album to On and On or In Between Dreams.  It has the same kind of vibe.  I don't skip a song on here - they're all great, but highlights include Washing Dishes, Shot Reverse Shot, Tape Deck, Radiate and Home.  If you enjoy any of JJ's previous albums, don't hesitate on this one.  Give it 3 full listens and you'll be hooked.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Not worth more than one dollar<br />The device only for YouTube, difficult to capture network<br />I do not recommend it<br /><br />Keep your money
B00ERIUO02|5.0|LOVE IT! Katy Perry - Prism is a darker and more personal side of the singer. It's obvious she has grown as a woman and performer. \\"Ghost\\" is my fav.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! So glad it finally came to Kindle. It works just like the mobile version. Absolutely awesome!
B0057F869U|5.0|Mia Wasikowska gives an amazing and unforgettable performance as Jane.  This is far and above the best &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; I have seen yet!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is a great show, with fantastic acting and a compelling storyline. My wife recommended it to me as a replacement for Breaking Bad (as if there could be one! Lol), and I have to say that it comes about as close as I could wish for. Great tv, to be sure.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I usually purchase games after reading reviews.......so I wanted to pass along my review. This is a FANTASTIC game! The designers at Fireproof Games are amazing and I cannot wait for their next game. You will NOT be disappointed with this game......it is a bit difficult (you HAVE to use your brain) but clues help out just enough without hiving the whole game away.<br />Buy this game and you will be happy!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Who wouldnt love this app?! I mean, i sure love this! i love bingo a lot even though im not old and i am very young. If you love bingo apps like this, ypu absolutely SHULD get this!
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Great graphics, a little touchie on the controls .i think the price is high for a android game, but other than that I like it
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the weather channel it keeps me in contact with what to wear in the morning before leaving my home.
B0089LOG02|4.0|What a good book!  I do like historically-based novels.  I was not familiar with the concept of shipping orphaned kids to the midwest to \\"sell\\" to people as farmhands or housekeepers.  The conditions some of these poor kids had to endure... It gives you a new appreciation of your own life and makes you more sensitive to those kids who grow up without a loving family. Although the language is a little rough at time, I would recommend!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Read this book because I am hooked on the TV series.  This was a fun read.  It was interesting to see which characters were changed and the different relationships from the series.  I actually like the characterization in the TV series better than the books but enjoy both.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The third book is not as good as the first two.  The writhing style changes.  Why change something if it's not broken?  In the end I realize why she did that.  I also found some inconsistencies.  Like mentioning it was warm but we just found out it was fall and getting cold or calling he a she.  It's a nice conclusion but a bit of a disappointment in the end.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|The story could get 10 stars.  I would have given it 5 except for the narration.  Seems to me that there are many narrators with an English accent and, surely, someone other than this narrator could have been picked.  He was awful.  Granted, this is a very long story and anyone reading it might get tired but this narrator should have given up early on.  Having said that, I loved the story and can't wait until Mr. Martin finishes the series.  Just hope he lives long enough to do the next two books!!  And, I hope someone else does the narrating.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I love it. Dimming and brightness is a breeze. Colors are cool and easy to change. And the price cannot be beat!
B007V65R54|3.0|Starts out great but then digresses into areas that are borderline irrelevant. Way too verbose, could have been much shorter with greater impact.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If the game didn't stop me, I don't know when I would stop playing. The game very addictive. I have been anxious to get it on my kindle.
0062225790|4.0|guilter7 gives the book one star, and ridicules it saying that it is no wonder that an audience laughs at 'something out of nothing'.  Perhaps if guilter7 were more learned he would know what physicist like Lawrence Krauss states in a 'Universe from Nothing', that there is something in nothing which creates something.  It would be wise if one such as the guilter would read and become informed before posting.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really did not think that this book was as bad as a lot of the negative reviews given. It was my least favorite of the 3, but I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />I hate comparing books to other books, but it kind of reminded me of the Hunger Games trilogy, where there is a lot of action in the first 2, and then the last one gets really militaristic and, just not why I started reading the series. I really disliked the 3rd book of that series. This book was starting to go down that path, but I'm happy that they kept the more integral characters involved, and more personal interaction between them, so it wasn't all war and not love.<br /><br />I know a lot of people are upset at the ending, but it is kind of nice for an author to go off the beaten path, and do something that you didn't think that they should do.<br /><br />In summary it was alright, I did enjoy reading it, not like the first one, but isn't that how it always is?
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Interesting characters with unexpected relationships.  Charming depiction of life in the rural town and friendships that are very poignant and realistic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is excellent. I have not read anything this good in awhile. It involved me from page one and left me not wanting to wait to start the next one.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A great book looking at social dilemmas through the simple barrier of language and race. A gripping story of childhood lost during a time of war.<br />The book is exciting and a wonderful addition to the science- fiction genre. It also does justice to the human element in the book.<br />Enjoy.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Started a little slower than his books usually do. Once it got started,couldn't put it down. His mind is amazing. Where does he come up with this stuff? Loved it.

B00004RFFS|1.0|The first half of the movie worked fine, then the movie froze, jumped forward (in the movie) and froze again. Took the disk out and a long scratch was on the disk. Guaranteed to work, I don't think so.

B0009P5YXO|1.0|I absolutely LOVE Doctor Who! But this Sonic Screwdriver is garbage. It needs some minor assembly that was sort of a pain in the butt. It is made of cheap feeling plastic and it feels like it could break or fall part which some pieces do, at any moment. The pieces that fall off are the buttom part of the screwdriver which is the pen part and the other piece that fell off and I lost was the tiny piece of plastic that goes around the part that makes it that you can change how the screwdriver's length. The only reason I bought the darn thing was because I thought it would be as good as the description claimed and that it was from Doctor Who.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a wonderful book,  that takes you up and down life's path of the main character.  You always find yourself rooting for her.  And hoping she will finally find the peace inside her beautiful mind and move forward.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|Cat's Cradle was a great book to read. I was a very quick read and it was very exciting.<br /><br />What is notably a science fiction book almost does not read like one. Cat's Cradle is pretty standard end of the world story with a twist that takes it into the science fiction realm. However, the twist would give away the plot.<br /><br />My only disappointment with the book was the ending. I've talked to others who think they way it ended was pure genius but I found the ending very anti-climactic. The fast paced story abruptly ends in a way that wraps up all loose ends, but I wish that Vonnegut had drawn it out more.<br /><br />Never the less, it was a great read and I recommend it to anyone who wants a fast paced, quick novel.
B00C061I1M|5.0|A great listen with many variations of the singers capacity to move from blues to blue grass while not sounding forced. I look forward to many more albums from this singer.
0385349947|2.0|[review adapted from a paper I wrote for a college class]<br /><br />Sandberg is mother of two, COO of Facebook successful TedTalker. Her talk was on how women don't speak up for themselves and sabotage their own success, and it was met with such acclaim she expanded it to a 167 page book.<br /><br />Sandberg points out early on, however, why she should not have embarked on this project: \\"I am not a scholar, a journalist or a sociologist. But I decided to speak out after talking to hundreds of women, listening to their struggles, sharing my own and realizing that the gains we have made are not enough and may even be slipping.\\" She at once is writing on how successful she is and about how the business world discriminates against women.  Without the training of journalism or sociology, her book lacks focus. She bounces confusingly from home life to her career and the broader business world, and fails in her attempt to generalize her own experiences to those most women would face.<br /><br />Sandberg cannot see past her own privilege,  which is problematic because few will succeed the way she has. She had money and connections in the first place.  Her husband is wealthy and emotionally supportive. Sandberg advises her intended audience of middle class women to take risks that for her, would not be risky at all.<br /><br />She is frank about her mistakes and myopia, but it is annoying because while she learns not to make that particular mistake, she continues to make that TYPE of mistake. For example, she learns when she is pregnant that it would be good business to have priority parking for pregnant workers. It doesn't occur to her before she, herself, is pregnant. She goes on and on about how she learned from this, but makes the same type of failing to put herself into someone else's shoes error repeatedly as the book goes on. Nothing is relevant until she experiences it, and then, boy is it EVER important.<br /><br />I am reminded of a wonderful book by Katherine Schwarzenegger, entitled Rock What You've Got.  Katherine is the daughter of Arnold and of Maria Shriver two of the most attractive people in the western world, and wrote about how whatever you are given, physically, work with it, love yourself. I picked up Katherine's book out of incredulity--what would SHE know about self-doubt? Katherine surprised me by making an excellent case that whoever you are, even a beautiful child of wealthy parents, you can still feel the sting of our judgmental society.<br />Sandberg fails to state clearly that even with every advantage, wealthy family, looks, connections, education, she still was held back because of her gender, or that she still sees how gender is a divisive factor in business.<br /><br />However, as my mother said, \\"I'll take good advice from a bad source.\\" There is an extent to which even a less-privileged person can use Sandberg's ideas. Women should speak up for other women. We should sit right up in front at conferences and take the good places at the table during business meetings.<br /><br />Sandberg's strength is collecting data: this percentage of women graduate college, this percentage are managers, this  study or book is helpful.  And she has some good observations:<br />\\"Social gains are never handed out.\\"<br /><br />\\"Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence.\\"<br />\\". . . effective communication starts with the understanding that there is my point of view (my truth) and someone else's point of view (his truth). Rarely is there one absolute truth. . . When we recognize that we can see things only from our own perspective, we can share our views in a nonthreatening way.\\"  This is similar to Kathy's observation that \\"If it is important to any one person, it is important to me to address it.\\"<br /><br />It is rare for me to say this, but this book would be more effective if Sandberg stepped back, used more studies, and gave less personal information.

B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is really fun it gets better and better and addicting. So if your parents don't like you playing on your device I wouldn't get it. But get it anyway because it is really fun.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|At first I was skeptical, I'm not a Harlequin romance kind of girl usually but I decided to give this a shot and I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised.  The chemistry between the two main characters was almost palpable.  I sometimes found myself a little frustrated with male character because of his hard headed denial but I know that was the point.  Well written and enjoyable, will read more by this author.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a feel good kind of romance.
B007AL48UK|4.0|When I first got the game it would crash a lot, but now it is so much better.  I play it daily and it is great fun.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's great if you want a cheap, super easy setup, media streaming device assuming the only media you want is from Netflix, Hulu Plus, or Youtube. Google is not allowing any other content provider to utilize the Chromecast and there is no date for when they will, if ever.<br /><br />Otherwise:<br />Setup: super simple.<br />Hardware Requirements:<br />Wireless network<br />HDMI input (on TV or entertainment system)<br />USB (on anything for power, I use my cable box) or a power outlet<br />Android phone/tablet or computer. I use a Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.<br /><br />Whatever device sends the \\"cast\\" becomes the remote, so in my case I have to grab my tablet when I want to pause, which isn't that responsive. I can't image using a phone. Can your phone support the Chromecast? If you can watch Netflix smoothly then probably. For a computer you need Chrome (the browser) and some additional plugins, but again you will have to go back to your computer/laptop to pause, rewind, ffwd, etc.<br /><br />Supposedly you can cast any web page from the Chrome browser. I tried to cast Sleepy Hollow from my laptop and I got a very choppy video, so it didn't work for video. The rest of the web page looked fine if you line to look at a website on your TV.<br /><br />I'll give it a fifth star when I can stream my movies from my NAS.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I have always loved Haunted House movies. I was so happy that this wasn't a movie filled with gore to be scary. I enjoyed the story and the flash back of the 70's thrown in. The acting was good which was surprising in a scary movie.

055338466X|5.0|This is a review by a layman grappling with the not so self-evident laws of the incredibly small and large physical realities.<br /><br />I read and very much enjoyed Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell although have not come across any of L. Mlodinow's several popular books on physics and quantum physics.<br /><br />This book is very different from the previous two Hawking books and several other readings on cosmology, all of which attempt to familiarize the lay audience with the intricate principles of modern physics, i.e. the theory of general relativity (GR), quantum mechanics (QM), various flavors of string theory complete with M-theory, and multiverses. Here, most of this knowledge is taken for granted at least on an elementary level. The authors focus instead on the philosophical aspects of the immense new knowledge that has been gained since Maxwell's formalization of electro-magnetism and Einstein's concept of space-time fabric. Ancient philosophers, legends of various religious worldviews, and respectful dispute with creationist beliefs make their appearances throughout the engaging narration. On the way to the \\"theory of everything,\\" that in the writers' opinion seems to be the hard-to-swallow concept of M-theory with its 10 spatial dimensions, we meet a few modern principles of acquiring knowledge. One of them is the \\"top down approach\\" which makes conclusions about the past based on the present using probability calculations instead of describing universal history as a linear event with a fixed beginning and predetermined outcome. Another is the \\"anthropic principle\\" which uses the very existence of humans as an argument in the interpretation of the Universe.<br /><br />The story we are presented with is an unapologetic utilization of the still poorly understood and even less readily imaginable principles of quantum mechanics. According to this worldview, our very existence is due to nothing else but quantum fluctuation in the primordial Universe, when its size was in the range of the Planck length (length of 10 to the negative 35 meters). In the randomness of temperature variations of multiple (10 to the 500!?) imaginable early universes one had just the right conditions, i.e. temperature differences, to be able to form clumps of material, the birthplace of present day galaxies, following the inflation. In fact the small but well documented temperature variation in the cosmic microwave background radiation is thought to be the thumbprint of this primordial quantum fluctuation.<br /><br />It seems to me that by the time galaxies formed, the laws of GR that apparently govern today's cosmos on a grand scale, overshadowed the principles of QM that dominated the \\"baby\\" Universe. Although this \\"changing of the guards\\" of the physical laws from QM to GR clearly had to be a continuum, until today even the smartest minds among us have not been able to find a theory that can describe a smooth transition between the two. QM and GR simply do not seem to coexist very well together: using QM laws, the GR equations invariably result in infinite results, the mathematical equivalence of \\"garbage.\\" The book however ends on a positive note: M-theory.<br /><br />Although M-theory itself, like all other major concepts of physics in this fairly short book, is only briefly presented, the authors leave little doubt about their current conviction that the theory is a major candidate for Einstein's unfulfilled dream, the unified theory. To illustrate what the real meaning of a \\"unified theory\\" may be, the authors discuss the Game of Life in full seven pages. The essence of the game is to build various structures based on three simple basic laws. These structures - one may look at them as multiverses - will evolve very differently despite the uniformity of the three rules depending on the initial conditions, i.e. how one places the two building blocks (life or death) on the checkered board at the beginning of the game. In the process, various formations are produced that seem to follow certain rules (think of the laws of thermodynamics, Newton's three laws of motion, etc.) while the underlying three basic rules never change.<br /><br />Of course, M-theory is not without controversies due to the mathematical complexities required to model it and the extremely small size of strings that are thought to be the theory's building blocks. In fact, the energy necessary to dissect matter to the infinitesimal size of strings and thus make them observable seems to be unattainable. Viewed in this way, the difference between a supernatural creator (God) and M-theory seems to be almost negligible at first glimpse. Although the authors don't explicitly get tangled in the emotional battle between spirituality and materialism, they provide sufficient circumstantial evidence in the form of reproducible observational data to make a strong intellectual argument that God is not necessary to answer mankind's ever recurring questions: `Why do we exist? Why is there something rather than nothing?' and the one question for which you have to be a physicist to ask: \\"Why this particular set of laws and not some other?\\"<br /><br />The book is a well-narrated, mostly enjoyable read even for a lay person like myself - someone not involved in the field of physics in any way. I think however that without a basic understanding of GR and QM much of the book's main premises will fly over a potential reader's head. The two books by Hawking mentioned at the beginning of this review will certainly be sufficient to appreciate the magical world revealed in The Grand Design: the world of theoretical physics and cosmology hidden from most of us who grew up on Euclidean geometry and Newtonian physics.<br /><br />There were only very few places where I felt a touch of too much technicality - e.g. \\"renormalization\\" -, or not sufficient clarity - e.g. brief references to \\"super symmetry\\", or the Feynman diagrams. Many of the pictures were intuitive and helpful, although I wish a few of them had more detailed captions - e.g. the figure of Quarks or the Triple Alpha Process. The cartoons were sufficiently witty to contribute to the overall entertaining mood of the book.<br /><br />I would recommend the book to all those interested in cosmology and particle physics, but most of all to those tickled by a natural scientific approach to life's great philosophical questions and the unquenchable thirst of humans to acquire knowledge.

1476727651|5.0|I have never really read Stephen King novels before because I thought they were too intense or creepy. Recently, I saw Kubrich's \\"The Shining\\" on TV. I had never seen it before and I decided to read the book because I thought the movie, while good, had a lot of information missing. I loved the book. It was so much more satisfying than the movie. I also bought the TV version of \\"The Shining\\" and I think it is much more true to the book than the Kubrich film.<br /><br />As soon as I finished the book, I saw that King had written \\"Doctor Sleep\\"....a sequel to \\"The Shining\\".....what an interesting coincidence! (Maybe I have a little shine myself)<br /><br />Anyway, \\"Doctor Sleep\\" was very enjoyable. It was creepy and suspensful...I alternated between not being able to put it down and having to walk away from it to take breaks because I got scared. I think this is a very respectable sequel to \\"the Shining.\\" Thank you, Stephen King!

B00G32OMF8|3.0|From the very first of the \\"Before...\\" movies, the \\"action\\", such as exists, takes off when The Conversation takes off, which in the first two is when they start walking about.  In this installment, the movie is almost half over before they really get talking.  Of course, a lot has changed:  They're middle aged, divorced, and remarried (to each other) and have twin girls.  They have commitments.  They have baggage.  Still, when the conversation finally takes off, it very quickly becomes a bicker fest.<br /><br />She starts it off with a simple question:  Would you still ask me to get off the train with you?  One could imagine he's hearing that at almost every anniversary and probably does away with it by smiling, saying \\"Of course\\", adding a bit of flattery, and perhaps a kiss.  For what ever reason, this time he hesitates, and then he stammers, and now she feels old and fat.  To make matters worse, he's just said good bye to the son he lost via his own divorce;  now a teenager, he's just finished a summer in Greece, and wow, far from being the adorable talking pet little kids are, he's almost human.  You can converse with him, most of the time.  And Dad wants more.  Unfortunately, he wants it all, the best of his old life, and his new French family.  Needless to say, the wife isn't at all amused at his suggestion they uproot and move to Chicago, the proximity of the spurned wife hardly being the least of the attractions.  So off they go on their squabble.<br /><br />As film arguments go, this is not a notable fight.  One thinks of the nastiness of \\"Long Days Journey Into Night\\", or the epic booze filled brawl between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in \\"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolfe\\", where two puffy actors, beyond their physical prime,  go at it, round and round, until the climax where, in a white rage of hate and bitterness, not a single drop of self loathing and maliciousness is wasted.  One can no more imagine this couple trying to carry off a fight on that scale any more than we can imagine Maggie Smith lofting \\"Un Bel Di\\", or any other aria.  But still, if you're going to fight, fight, don't bicker.  What we end up with is a couple caught on a bad day, and not a particularly notable one at that.<br /><br />Ah well.  If you've already seen the other two you'll have to see this one.  The first in the trilogy is still the best, and who knows, in fifteen years or so, perhaps they'll find each other when their ties have loosened and their baggage has fallen away, and in nascent old age, realize that there's still something there.  We're not there yet, but I could sit through that one too.  So, while it's not as good as the first time, what is?  We wouldn't be so fat if we stopped at the first, and best, bite of chocolate.
006202406X|1.0|I don't even know where to begin because the whole story and it's twists and turns are boring! It gets to a point where you already know what's going to happen next but you get disappointed because the author failed to give justice to the plot. Why use a POV,when the author failed to give substance to it? It was like blah- blah boring and monotonous. The author wanted to put drama by killing Tris, which is expected by the way, but how she died is just poorly written, rushed and irritating! How she &#34; saved&#34; Caleb from succumbing to death, by pointing a gun at him, is just, c'mon! And then there are too many other things that were discussed a little extensively, like using a bulletproof vest when Tris was with Amar, but she failed to remember considering that when they were planning? Everything in here is just disappointing and it's tiring to just even spill it all here.<br />Veronica Roth failed to achieve a heart-breaking-heart-warming-climactic-good story. It's a big disappointment! And please stop explaining why Tris has to die because your readers are not dumb. It's the whole story that makes it so poor.<br />They gave so much hype to this book, but it's not worth it. I will not watch the movie, and I will discourage friends to buy the book. I actually want to return mine.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|With singer songwriters becoming increasingly rare, it is refreshing to see one so young with so much to say. Lorde seems wise beyond her years in her observation of our cultural values. Or maybe it is just the view of it through a child's eyes.

1451666179|5.0|She is talented, original, and witty as they come.<br /><br />And yet, she doesn't produce only surface-guffaws.  The is genuine truth behind them. Sometimes in reading her stories, you just know her zany humor is pouring out through tears, coming from a situation that more painful that playful.  Her stories connect us to her humanity and there is real life in every laugh.<br /><br />This girl... her talent is taking her places, and I hope her sense of humor gets her through all of life's challenges.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this story. To read both characters struggles to finally realize they should be together made this book interesting to read to me.

B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Todd Thiede brings to us an engaging murder mystery set in a small, midwestern town.  After the opening scene (the murderer brings to task the time-wasting life choices of his victims) one it left to wonder what happens next.  How did this killer become obsessed with time and the wasting of it?  How are the detectives going to sort this all out?  Easy-to-follow dialog and plot development keeps you moving right along.  For 99-cents how can you go wrong with spending a day or 2 delving into Todd's new book?

B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've ever read, it has so much action and it's fast paced but it is also intimate and romantic. This is one of two books that have ever made me cry... It is that good. Please read this book, or really the whole series and don't listen to the low reviews about a bad ending, it was the perfect ending to this series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's an awesome book series  and they make awesome movies and I can wait for the next amazing movie :)

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I gave Candy Crush 4 stars instead of 5 for a couple of reasons.  First, there are some levels that are so difficult that you must succumb to paying for the extra moves or special \\"cheats\\" to complete the level.  Or you just keep trying and trying  for about 3 weeks until they give up and let you level up.<br />Second, I would like some explanation of new things that crop up, such as the chocolate. I took several attempts to figure out their purpose and how to eliminate them. Another waste of time.<br />Third, I don't like having to get friends to assist me to a higher level.<br />Other than those nuisances, Candy Crush is Highly Addictive and Entertaining!<br /> I recommend it to everyone!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I LOVE this  app. You make a lot of money everyday to spend on making your city more efficient. I like the truck, bus and dumpster route allocation. There are a lot of buildings to keep up. SO much fun!

1449305172|5.0|This is a very solid read on how to start moving forward with applying Lean principles. The business model canvas and the accompanying website are very useful tools to look at your concept more broadly. In addition to good practices, Ash provides examples from his own experience.<br /><br />I reference it often and have also used Amazon's digital format to annotate it with my notes.

B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I feel it could be a better game if the power ups were free. I never had to pay Nintendo for more 1ups just jump on a koopa for a bit. A more logical example is the 30 lives on contra not 30 minutes for 5 to regenerate. Nuff said I'm going to go play GTA V.

0385523394|2.0|NY TImes best seller?  Really?  I felt nothing for these characters, I think because the author mainly gave just external descriptions. (I know how tall the woman was who used to be a man, but what kind of person was she?)  I never felt I got inside any of the characters' heads.  Interesting (and distressing) facts about our criminal justice system were described but these could have (and in my opinion, should have) been presented in a newspaper or magazine article without the failed attempt at a &#34;story line&#34; with &#34;characters.&#34;
006202406X|1.0|This is the first time I've ever wished I hadn't started a series because the last book ruined the others. \\"Allegiant\\" is riddled with plot holes, characters who have had complete personality changes, and the most useless twist ending I've read in a while. Planes that magically can't be seen from Chicago when the airport's mere miles away? Sure. Farcical, predictable drama that doesn't fit at all with the story? Check. Logical flaws that Roth apparently missed and / or hoped her readers wouldn't be bright enough to notice? Got it! For instance - the Bureau is one of \\"several\\" government agencies that deal with genetic research. Yet, because a bunch of teenagers erased the memories of a few hundred Bureau workers, all the rest of the government totally won't notice that THIS agency has now completely changed its mission and is turning Chicago into a haven of tolerance and genetic acceptance. Right. Tris has a problem with the erasure of her city's memories, but has no problem with erasing the memories of another set of people? This is the Tris who another character says is deeply attuned to humanity and suffering, yet she sees no gray area in doing to her enemies the actions that make them her enemies in the first place?<br /><br />I don't have a problem with a sad ending when it's meant to be part of the story - \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\", anyone? This ending, and the entire book, felt like Roth threw every literary device she could onto her computer screen and just kept typing. Where were her editors? Tris and Tobias's narrative voices were almost indistinguishable, Tris's so-called sacrifice is entirely contrived, and the reader is left feeling duped and discouraged.<br /><br />\\"Divergent\\" and \\"Insurgent\\" must have been written by a different author than the one who made this mess.
B005PK56TA|5.0|The idea is to pursue a different story line each season using the same actors.  1 is a haunted house, but in a truly unique ala &#34;Thirteen Ghosts&#34; way.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Quintessential King!! Reading this felt like having coffee with an old friend! I didn't want it to end. King is a master storyteller!!
B000JLTRIG|5.0|This 7th Season prepared me for their 'Final Season' (of which, I just ordered).  I loved all the 'actors/actresses' whether they played the 'good' guys or the 'bad' guys. I loved the fact that these Women )Phoebe, Piper and Paige had taken on each scene 'totally different' from their 1, 2 and 3 seasons.  They were 'sure' of their powers, they 'added' new powers to their 'list'.  They had lovers that became husbands and Piper still loved her hubby.  At times, their lives were 'intense' and 'emotional' but they found themselves and stayed focus and true to their art as ''WITCHES'' do.  They stayed together as 'families' do and helped each other when the going was rough.  I would recommend everyone of 'all ages' to open their mind to a world of magic.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|A lot of people are upset about the way the book ended and were complaining that the whole series was ruined for them by the ending so I almost didn't read the book. I’m happy to say, I’m glad I did. If you actually READ the story and absorb it, you’ll get it. You’ll understand why the sacrifice was so important and why it mattered. I loved this series and while I would have preferred a happily ever after, I finished the book and felt like the story was complete.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|The 'Walking Dead' series was an 'eye-opener' for me.  I always loved watching ''zombies'' but these series kept me on 'pins and needles'!  It made me look at 'different' types of 'dead people'.  I loved the way the actors/actresses played their roles &#62; lost, panic stricken, angry and yet; they wanted to 'live' not 'die'.  At times I was 'glued' to the TV and other times; I had my 'eyes closed' because it was frightening and gory.  There were heroes and then there were 'the bad guys' in every series.  I can't wait for Season four!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|I blew through this book in 6 hours. I could not put it down! I think Sylvia Day is a great writer and her style of writing is so engaging, it's hard to tear yourself away.
B00E7Z7D2M|4.0|Can't tell you when is the last time I have opted to listen to the radio but heck the stuff being pumped out today is pure trash. I'm thankful for artists like Robert Glasper or I would be completely devoid of music. He's a breath of fresh air and I have been waiting months for this day to hear Black Radio 2. While I would not deem Black Radio 2 to be as artistically edgy and/or expiremental as I came to appreciate about the first Black Radio, I'm still VERY pleased with this album and have too many favorites to number. Thanks for keeping good music alive Robert!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was referred to this series by a fellow 50 Shades lover and after reading it, I love it more than the 50 Shades series. Its very well written and I love the characters, its easy to get engaged in the story.
1449305172|5.0|Ash has a keen sense of customer development and lean startup practical application and his teachings in this book are helpful for many tech startups with a key focus on scalable web startups where validated learning of business model theories comes best with a true MVP (minimum viable product) - defining what the MVP is thus the most important part and discovering insights to help you with that is why i love and highly recommend this book to all founders I meet or work with.<br /><br />If you're one of those people with too many ideas and need a better way to 'pivot' to success with your web/software tech startup - Running Lean is a great reference to your Lean Startup bookshelf -- so stop experimenting with your 'ideas'  and start systematically executing your ideas with relentlessness backed by Ash's sound advice and wisdom.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this story and have read it twice since I purchased it. The relationship is amazing, the sex scenes don't seem repetitive to me like some other books in this same genre do and the story is very engrossing. I'm eagerly awaiting the other novels!
1452115567|5.0|Recommended for anyone who loves dogs, travel, photography or storytelling.  I purchased this as a gift for a friend who recently lost a dog (much better than cut flowers or a plant that could end up in the pastures too, right?).  Maddie is a beautiful dog and the photos of her are simply amazing.

B0082S3FA4|4.0|Sherlock Holmes # 3<br /><br />Happily married and busy with his medical practice, Watson always seems able to drop everything when Holmes wants his help. Contains: A Scandal in Bohemia, The Red-Headed League, A Case of Identity, The Boscombe Valley Mystery, The Five Orange Pips, The Man With the Twisted Lip, The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle, The Adventure of the Speckled Band, The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb, The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor, The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet, The Adventure of the Copper Beeches.<br /><br />eBook downloaded from Gutenberg. Holmes is more sympathetic in this collection than the earlier books but still remote from the concerns of the everyday world, and many of the stories are closer to horror than I like. The stories themselves are extremely clever mysteries and classics in the genre. The Gutenberg file is mostly free of errors.

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Bowie prior to the mid-eighties released theatrical concept albums that were something between opera and music hall, using the artist/audience relationship as the medium to explore need and desire.  What do you really want from life?  What do I really want?  You? I?  Three decades later a 67 year old man with compromised health has something new to say about the past, about career, about private life. Bowie at his best was always the questioning existentialist.  He is not tiring in this new release.  The energy is intense.<br /><br />The stars in the sky are recurring images from song to song, fixing the theme, distant, cold, but sometimes embodying personas from friends from the past.  Eternity and the personal are present. Who am I, he asks, seeing that he is both, seeing that he asks the question, seeing that he is all of those things, seeing that meaning now revolves around that peculiar axis.<br /><br />This is a terrific concept album performance. The theme is developed and changes from track to track, the opening track is a powerful introduction and the closing track is an eloquent closing.  Throughout, the progression draws the audience in.<br /><br />The music is layered, complex, full of rage appropriate to the questions. That rage in the act of questioning energizes everything.  Bowie's rebellious, insightful, realistic musical field.  Music and personal libretto go hand in hand, like great opera.<br /><br />This album is good because Bowie says something complex and serious.

B001NHNG64|4.0|I am so glad that I just happened to mention at dinner one night that I kinda liked the Jack a Reacher movie in front of my father in law. His response was (after complaining that Tom Cruise is way too short to play him) was \\"you do know there is a whole series of books with Jack Reacher\\" well this is my second book read and I am looking forward to the third!
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|It's about time. A truly good movie that is not full of a ton of curse words and body counts. This is a very complex and yet simple movie that has lots of twists and turns. Also has a surprise ending twist. This is Hollywood like it use to be, back when they had people with imagination and creativity. People are not allowed to think on their own anymore and these talents suffer greatly for that.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book was very wonderful. Suzanne really killed it. This story earned its five stars for being cunning, witty, and exciting. I recommend this book to any readers hungry (excuse the irony) for a good novel.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|From reading other reviews, it seems people were expecting some kind of paean to domestic bliss, where everything is perfect and Bridget marries either Mark or Daniel and they have 2.5 children and her foibles are constrained to not speaking enough Portugese to communicate to the maid or something. What a dull book that would have been.<br /><br />Instead, Fielding has chosen to give Bridget some interesting problem. Yes, the love of her life has died and left her with two tiny children, her house is a mess, her career prospects are confusing and somewhat dismal, and some of her friends are still a bit of a trainwreck. Isn't that why we all liked these books in the first place?<br /><br />My problem with the book is the same problem I have with all Bridget books: they're not very realistic. Can I please just say that 135ish pounds is not overweight on most people? We have no idea how tall Bridget is supposed to be, so I'm still pretty disinterested in her moping over weight problems that probably don't exist. She's evidently very attractive for her age, so why isn't there any acceptance of that? And where, oh where, do these hunky guys come from who absolutely adore her? (now, to be fair, Fielding did a good job addressing the problems an older widow with two very small children might have when dating a far younger partner.)<br /><br />In short: if you enjoyed the other books and didn't take them too seriously, this is a fine ending to the series.

I like the ability to stand my kindle and the magnet that wakes your screen when you open it. I highly recommend the Marware brand as it seems to offer decent products at competitive prices.<br />* one thing though: PLEASE double check what generation of kindle fire you are buying for. I messed up the first time because I assumed my kindle was the newest one (I won it in a raffle) but it wasn't. Just check twice, and if you compare by serial number or whatever when figuring out what gen your kindle is, check again because I did that and it was still wrong.

0316044695|5.0|Just to start off, This is my favorite book. This book puts you in Marcus's shoes and gives you an eyewitness account of what his early military experience was like. This is a very dramatic book that draws out many different emotions from humor too sadness. I specifically like his political rants and views (stay out of our way and we'll stay out of yours). I recommend this book to any reader along with its sequel Service: A Navy Seal at War. I read one right after the other and didn't stop to put them down. If all of the other five star reviews haven't already sold you on this book then hopefully mine persuades you to start this great series of two books.

0316055433|3.0|If you’re looking for a tried-and-true literary device with which to start an action-packed novel, the stolen painting is a good candidate. In last year’s THE ART FORGER, B.A. Shapiro crafted an entertaining tale out of an artist’s attempts to paint copies of a work pinched from Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Now, in THE GOLDFINCH, Donna Tartt’s 800-page novel, a masterwork taken from New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art after a terrorist attack is the catalyst for an overwritten but inventive story that includes bipolar Wall Street executives, Ukrainian druggies with ties to criminal elements, and failed actors contriving equally doomed careers as Vegas gamblers.<br /><br />The protagonist is 13-year-old Theo Decker, a Manhattan student who has been suspended from school for smoking. Theo and his mother, Audrey, are on their way to a meeting at school. Audrey has an art history degree from NYU and supervises photo shoots for an ad agency. Theo’s father, a former actor, abandoned the family a year earlier. Audrey and Theo are early for the meeting, so they stop at the Met to see an exhibit of Dutch paintings, “Portraiture and Nature Morte: Northern Masterworks of the Golden Age.”<br /><br />While they are in the museum, a terrorist bomb explodes. Dozens are killed, including Audrey, who is struck in the head by flying debris from the gift shop, where the bomb was planted. Theo survives. When he comes to, he finds lying next to him a dying old man coated in ash. The bleeding stranger babbles to Theo about Mozart and France and piano lessons. He implores Theo to take from the rubble a small painting of a goldfinch, a 1654 work by the Dutch painter Carel Fabritius. Then he removes a gold ring from his finger and presses it into Theo’s palm. “Hobart and Blackwell,” the man says. “Ring the green bell.”<br /><br />Theo moves in temporarily with the Barbours, a wealthy family whose younger son, Andy, is one of his closest friends atschool. Shortly after the move, Theo looks up Hobart and Blackwell in the phone book and discovers that it is the name of a business in the West Village. When he visits the building, he sees that it is an antiques shop, with trinkets such as Staffordshire dogs and “settees upholstered in sallow old brocade” in its dusty windows. A tall, haggard-looking man answers the door. After Theo gives him the ring, the stunned man introduces himself as Hobie and invites Theo in.<br /><br />What follows is an intricately plotted adventure that, over 14 years, takes Theo from Hobie’s old curiosity shop to the desert of Las Vegas and the streets of Amsterdam. The one constant throughout these adventures is the stolen painting, which Theo has hidden in a pillowcase. No one, not even the authorities, knows he has it.<br /><br />Read a review of THE GOLDFINCH, including this one, and you’re bound to see the word Dickensian. Tartt encourages the comparison: Hobie refers to Ebenezer Scrooge and the Artful Dodger; characters have names like Bracegirdle and Havistock Irving; a major character becomes an orphan. And the novel, like Dickens’s best works, is huge.<br /><br />THE GOLDFINCH possesses the good and bad qualities of Dickens’s output. Tartt’s novel, like much of the Dickens canon, would have benefited from more rigorous editing. Tartt rarely passes up an opportunity to give us five or six details when one or none would have sufficed. She tells us the names and titles of five administrators whose offices Theo passes as he escapes the bombed-out museum. We learn the names of five of Andy’s AP classes, the titles of the Graham Greene films he watches one night, the menu items at a Las Vegas restaurant. The lawyer Bracegirdle begins a conversation with Theo by reciting a page-long backstory of the circumstances whereby he met Theo’s mother. Parenthetical digressions abound.<br /><br />However, the novel entertains despite its excesses. Tartt’s strength is plot. She has created many well-drawn characters and clever twists, although some of the latter depend on coincidences and chance meetings in a city of eight million. THE GOLDFINCH is far from perfect, but give Tartt credit for daring to write a book that is so brazenly different from many other modern novels.<br /><br />Reviewed by Michael Magras
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this book.  Great author.  Could not put it down and I am not a reader.  Will recommend to everyone
B0079XPUOW|2.0|I bought this book because the description of the story seemed to be unique.  However it is not well written and the plot drags.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game I love the boosters and how it gets harder the further you go in the game it is highly addictive
B0028MBKVG|5.0|As I was beginning to get in shape I decided to pick this book up and give it a try.  The story is amazing and can bring out the love for running in all kinds of runners throughout the world.  I loved it!!!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I do not like that you have to wait hours just to move on to another level. Not only that<br />but I have to keep the game up just for the time to pass. Stupid!!!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's fun and addictive but you might as well face it that you are going to have to purchase gems to get anywhere. They don't come up near often enough to grab and you'll NEVER have a really long run without using a ton of them. The first few \\"saves\\" only cost one gem, then 3, then 11, then 27, etc... Just buy the pack of 500 for $20. Even those will be gone before you know it.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Felt like it was an obligatory book. Not a lot of character or story development. But a good book none the less.
1935182617|5.0|If you're a software developer working with the ubiquitous PDF format, you have probably heard of the iText library for Java developers (or it's cousin, the iTextSharp library for C# developers).<br /><br />iText/iTextSharp is the de facto standard toolkit for working with PDFs--fast, relatively easy, comprehensive. If you need to stuff an Acrobat Form with data, iText is for you. If you need to parse a document into pages, iText is for you. If you need to assemble thousands of pages of construction documents in various sizes and forms, ship them halfway around the world for local printing and delivery--iText is indispensable. (Been there, done that, used iTextSharp.)<br /><br />But--iText is not perfect. iText is pseudo-free software, in the sense that the library can be downloaded for free--but the library is next to useless without the documentation. And the documentation is this book--iText in Action (Second Edition). To put it another way, to use iText you have to RTFM--and this is the, ahem, manual you have to read.<br /><br />Lots of examples, lots of explanation, lots of help with your project--I highly recommend this book.
B00CVDXSYO|5.0|Joanna David, a wonderful actress and fantastic reader, has made this edition of, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", a true delight. I've loved her acting for years and knew that her voice would be perfect for an Austen audio book. She does a stunning job and I would highly recommend this version. Sadly, this is abridged, but she makes it come alive and it's well worth it.

B003TOMAPC|5.0|I remember watching this movie and thinking it was going to be a comedy with kids dressing up in costumes. Then the violence suddenly got turned up full volume and it never really let up. I still can't believe somebody actually wrote this story. It is so very twisted and shocking. But it really isn't for kids. I think it might be too warped. How is that for an endorsement.
1620404869|3.0|Some of my friends absolutely adore the author Shannon Hale. So it was that, added with the fact that the plot centered around an Austen-addict, that made me pick this book up.<br /><br />The story focuses on Jane, an Austen lover how has let the obsession take over her life. She spends more time with her BBC version of Pride & Prejudice then she does with non-fictional men. When her wealthy great-aunt Carolyn leaves her a trip to the super secretive Pembrook Park, she sets off for England. Over the course of the stay she realizes that being in Austenland isn't all that she dreamed it would be.<br /><br />Generally, I liked the book. I'm not really sure what to say about it, hence the short review. It was fairly short, pretty quirky, and ended on a happy note. There was, however, one thing that caught my attention. Amanda, from the Zen Leaf, wrote a review which pointed this out. Here's a link to her review. On page 158 (of the paperback edition), the book says: \\"Jane caught sight of a very striking Colonel Andrews, who, now that she watched him dance, might just be gay.\\" While I love Shannon Hale, she was great at her author signing...this kind of threw me. Yes, he was gay, but the stereotype in this line pulled me out of the story completely. I felt like that was a totally unnecessary way to mention his sexuality.<br /><br />Aside from that line, I thought that book was cute. I was really in need of a light, fluffy book, and this one delivered. Although, it has left me thinking about my Austen mini-obsession. Would I really go so far as to spend a few weeks at a faux-Austen getaway?
B006UV8DJS|5.0|This app is so fun!!! It's so worth the money!! The effects are awesome and so cool! I love it and don't look at the other comments. This app is awesome!!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Cinder totally captivated me. If I were to look back, I would say that it, in combination with Scarlet, are my top two books of the year. I know I'm really behind on this one, since it was released in January of 2012.<br /><br />I was so involved in this book that it was pretty much all I talked about during the few reading breaks that I took (I'm sure that I annoyed a couple people). The story is great, although it's a re-telling, the world-building is awesome. The characters are fresh, and surprisingly don't fall into any of the typical YA tropes and situations. I never wanted to bonk anyone over the head for making idiotic choices (how often does that happen...very rarely). Yes, one of the major plot points is predictable, but it's a re-telling...so that's kind of how it works!<br /><br />I can't rave enough about how enchanting this series is. I haven't been more excited and entertained in quite some time!
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|It's a great game , fun . It's Must have  of games . This game actually taught m  how to play pool it's like I'm right there :)

B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works great!  Love the sounds that come with it and the weather option is a plus too!  Highly recommend this alarm clock!
1476727651|4.0|It starts out great but kind of becomes slow and predictable at the end.  The main villains were kind of inept and I was unable to take them serious, they just weren't scary, most geriatrics aren't.  I guess I expected a darker book like the original Shining.  I noticed some resemblance between this book and Dan Simmon's Carrion Comfort, Doctor Sleep was more of a Carrion Comfort Light.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Although I found this version of the The Great Gatsby entertaining, I still like the version with Robert Redford better!

B00B2TUKI0|3.0|Madeleine Peyroux  has one of the most intriguing voices ever but seems to struggle with how to use it. This cd is ok but certainly not her best work by any means.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to know how close the movie &#34;Blade Runner&#34; was to the novel. How such a nice surprise when I found that the movie was based on the novel, but this in itself is much richer. It has a much more intricate story going behind, of businessman concerned with the profits of their company, while men and women left on a decaying Earth try to live each day, one day after the other. It tells also of a new faith that somehow makes people go forward (nowhere?) in that world destroyed by nuclear war. Do people also dream of electric sheep?
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I just comp;eted reading allegiant. After reading the first 2 books i Could hardly wait to dive into the final installment of the truely endearing young people,tobais and Tris.I lived and went to school in Chicago so was easy for me to picture the devistating futuristic setting of this awesome city that I love.By the third book I was completely envested in the lives of the hero and heroine.I was applaudding and cheering  their every move. They batteled their way through seemingly impossible circumstances against incredible odds, while changing from reckless children to young adults capable of mature and sacrificial love, only to be rewarded with the brutal annialation of one and total emotional devastation of the other.what a diplorable ending!! What a let down !! If ms roth was just trying to demonstrate that that's what happens in real life....I would like to remind her that this whole story is fantasy and implausable from the get go so why not leave your reader felling good about what they have just invested a lot of time and money in. Tris and four could have triumphed over evil and led their friends and family into a better world together and left your audience cheering and ready to read it all over again.Insted, I am going to tell my reader friends the ending... and my dissapointment in it and recomend they read something else if they want a good read that leaves you feeling better than when you started not worse.I truely recomend you rewriting the ending.

Am sure the gamepad works, but after I think it's really worth it to invest in something more better - especially for gamers! I am more than confident that any gamer will be upset with this one.

B00CATSONE|5.0|Never would I have thought of reading a book like this, but I am so glad that I did. Not only did it open my eyes on the subjects, but it gave me historical information that I found very interesting in an almost narrative form. Enjoyed it and finished it quickly

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another winner for John Grisham.  Great plot twists and just enough history from &#34;A Time To Kill&#34; that you felt like you really knew the characters.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Allie Brosch is a genius. I meant to save this book and only read one or two stories at a time but of course I went and read it all at once. There are quite a few new stories in here, even more than I expected, and they all have the same great quality as the posts on her website.<br /><br />Just make sure you read this book in a place where you won't get strange looks for laughing aloud because that's going to be happening a lot.

B00EI2CTLY|5.0|The long awaited debut by Lily & Madeleine starts off very pleasantly.<br />Songs like \\"Devil we know\\" or \\"Spirited away\\" tell us straight-away what L&M are about:<br />Beautiful close-harmony vocals and quality-songwriting to make dozens of self-acclaimed \\"Singer-Songwriters\\" feel ashamed or envious.<br />But that is only the beginning.<br /><br />Once you know what this record is about, L&M will take you on a mesmerizing journey...<br />Comes track number 5 \\"Disappearing heart\\" -followed by the likes of \\"Paradise\\", \\"And tonight\\", \\"You got out\\",<br />\\"Lost upon the sea\\", \\"Come to me\\" and hidden track \\"Token\\"etc...- things start to become really mind-blowing.<br /><br />The second-half of this beautiful debut sounds like a \\"Best of\\"-collection of some well-respected, classic group<br />calling us from the golden age of music (Let's just say: The 60s).<br /><br />The overall production sound is warm, dynamic, breezy and sparse in the best way.<br />Allowing the songs and the voices to shine. And how they shine...<br />You can't tell how it works on you, but the soft, airy and gentle sound of their voices (plus some little twists of  \\"Twang\\" at all the right places)<br />will get you addicted. You will listen again and again and again again....<br /><br />The sisters are gifted with a very natural and flowing songwriting-style.<br />Combined with their perfect pitch and phrasing they will leave you stunned.<br />The atmosphere of the whole album is best described as romantic: Reflections of all human affections like<br />love, loss, fear, hope, desire, regret, joy.<br /><br />Yes, teenagers they are but this ain't what I would call typically teenage-pop. It ain't A.O.R. either.<br />It's the music of two young women who obviously do nothing else but concentrating on what matters to THEM.<br />If you like it then you are invited to float with them, if you don't, well..then...<br />I might fear that you have burried your heart somewhere way down deep.<br /><br />Cleverly adjusted to whatever market!? No.<br />Naive hymns of youthful nothingness!? NO way!<br />Cynical reflections of two smart-ass, overly protected snob-kids!? Are you kidding? Never....<br />I sense what I'd call \\"relative innocence\\"...<br />Quite hard to understand that Lily and Madeleine are two more or less \\"ordinary\\" teenagers<br />that lead a double life (;) in providing classic, catchy and heartfelt americana tunes, clothed in a beautiful vintage mood and style.<br /><br />To me it's the 1st time that I am allowed to watch the the rise and development of what I dare to call by now \\"classic artists\\"<br />= Lily and Madeleine.<br /><br />Their amazing abilities are all over the place, yet this is a humble, a confident and also very colourful collection of great songs and great vocal-delivery.<br />Even if this amazing debut and the brilliant \\"The weight of the globe\\" EP should be the only things the world would have by these sisters;<br />it is already more than enough to justify a place in your heart and for a well-deserved entry in the golden book<br />of the world's greatest singer-songwriters....<br /><br />Thanks to Lily and Madeleine....

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I pre ordered this book after reading the first 2. I was so excited to read it. I was very confused and had to keep going back to the begining of the chapter to remember who was talking.  Then came the end. It was the most horrible ending I have ever read. It has bothered me since. I read books for the happy endings. I appriciate the shock value and wanting to be different but this ruined the whole series for me. I am now second thinking seeing the movie. I.definatly do not want to see that ending. Save yourself the heart ache and disappointment. Don't read this book.
141690977X|4.0|It's strange to think that you can read a book that repeatedly tells you the guy you want is &#34;just not that into you&#34; and yet at the same time have an enormous boost in self-esteem.  And somehow this book pulls it off. I would recommend that it be taught in schools, and that every girl read it.  Sure, a lot is common sense but sometimes you just need to be hit in the face with something before you learn.  I would give this book 5 stars but the whole &#34;he's just not that into you&#34; line got a little old and a little cheesy. But honestly its worth a read
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy candy crush is avalible for the kindle!!!!!!! Yor have made my day!!!!! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I like it but everything in canterlot costs way to much. You people need to lower the prices or I will stop playing. I won't spend all my money on a stupid game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is terrific!! I finished it and was sitting in my algebra class crying! It is the best book ever written!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush IS the Game of the century! Never a dull moment, it challenging with seemingly never ending adventures at each level!
B002ZB26AO|4.0|While it covers the history of North Korean leadership very well, I sometimes find myself wondering, is this really true or simply opinion.  Some critiques seem too extreme.  For example, the section on the sex life of Kim Il Sung.  As secretive as his rule was, who could know as much about his sex life as the author claimed.  It seemed far fetched.  However, I don't know where else one could find the same quantity of detailed information about the North Korean leadership as<br />this book offers.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This was a fun, exciting, fast-paced addition to all things Star Trek with some surprises thrown in along the way.<br /><br />All the actors were cast so well, fitting with their older counterparts seamlessly.<br /><br />Khan was cold, evil, diabolical.<br /><br />Spock actually showed some emotion. In fact, the bromance between Spock and Kirk this time around was almost over-the-top.<br /><br />Special effects were outstanding, superb - just as we've come to expect in the Star Trek movies.<br /><br />Well worth watching and well worth having in your permanent library.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Grand kids can talk you into almost anything but this was a good purchase.  I'm sure I'll like it too.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I was expecting more than what this movie ended up being since I normally enjoy Will Smith movies and I've enjoyed about half of the Shyamalan movies.<br /><br />Instead Jaden Smith actually stars in the movie with his Dad, Will Smith co-starring. Jaden was great in the 2010 version of [[ASIN:B0041OOEJY The Karate Kid]] but this movie is a real stinker. Stilted dialogue, laughable plotline, bad acting by both Smiths - I'm glad I just rented this and didn't buy it.<br /><br />It could have been good. That's what so frustrating. The idea behind the film is cool. Special effects were fun. It just didn't come together in a cohesive package. Too bad.
B007HO392S|5.0|New and tried and true songs were just what I wanted to hear. Highly recommend this album for a lively hour's worth of music.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game had me sucked in for hours. fun concept. great graphics and use of the kindles abilities. I just wish the game was longer. I hear the next one will be available by the end of the year. I'm looking foreword to its release. make more games like this one!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy candy crush has made it to kindle. NOW I don't have to run my battery down on my phone
B0037VNX44|5.0|I feel the movie was really good. I like how the main character is his own narrator. It can get very dark, serious, and funny at times. Overall a good movie I feel.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Supernatural is one of my all-time favorite shows, and I absolutely dread the day that it goes off the air. Season 8 was fantastic! They found a really good story arc in the tablets. Not going to lie, I was kind of happy when the Leviathan arc finally ended.
B009HEMW4W|3.0|Worth seeing just to say you saw all 3 of the movies, but overall not as interesting a story (another time travel story? come on hollywood!) as the first one.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I would have given this great app 5 stars if it didn't ask me to upgrade every time I open it. Other than that, it works perfectly and I like the choices of alarm sounds and music.
030759565X|5.0|Then my mom stole it and then my aunt stole it from her. All three of them love this book. The pictures are lovely and the recipes are super easy to follow. Its all every day things dressed up a bit.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game. very easy to link with my FACEBOOK account without having to play through my computer. so glad they made an app for the kindle fire.
0307010856|5.0|Great book! Was it necessary to give away the plot twist,Description writer? Especially loved the many ways Grover uses to protect the Reader from the monster at the end of the book.
B005HIEFC4|4.0|Good movie but somewhat unrealistic! I watched it a couple of times! But the dancing scenes are neat but not so realistic with the plot.
0061733199|4.0|I gave this as a gift to my boyfriend and liked this best over another survival book I got him. He stated lots of information and made him think about certain situations.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Amazing and simple read! Nicely complied insight from other great-think tankers! The day I read the chapter talking about 222, 222 showed up in a substantive law I had been quoting. That took less than 2 hours for the number to turn up in my life. In fact the number had been there all along, I just needed a new pair of eyes to experience it with.
0439023521|4.0|... with a good slice of Romeo and Juliet added for color then throw in a splash of double jeopardy. Interestingly different sci-fi written from a gentler, female perspective - not a hardware techo gadget testosterone gore point of view. There is not much of an element of surprise or suspense however, everything is a little too Gothic romance predictable to give it 5 stars.
0802473156|5.0|I bought this book for my ex-boyfriend and sent it with his stuff when he moved out but left few things behind. Maybe, he'll learn something from this book since he didn't hear me. Thanks
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Always been a fan of match 3 games and this is no exception. With a lot of added twists! Addictive:)
B008J34466|5.0|I love pink's music. So far it's my favorite CD as of late (of hers). And it's very convenient to be able to order things on-line. Thanks
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Just too many things that made us all laugh and say some line from the matrix. We talked alot during this film which is something I usually do not allow but, we couldnt help it. I liked Brads Z movie much better and I dont like zombie movies.
0345525558|5.0|My friend likes this kind of books. I don't. I found out about it in a People magazine. My friend loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|While visiting our adult son in Colorado, he recommended that my husband would enjoy the challenge, but soon got bored.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm app is one of the best that I have seen and downloaded.  It gives the temperature and wind speed.  Love this application.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this after getting a good review off of The Oprah Bookclub Website.<br /><br />I love the book, couldn't put it down. It is a thriller for sure with twists and turns that are very unexpected.<br /><br />That being said, I got to the last chapter and was pissed. Such an amazing book to have such a crappy ending.<br /><br />I do recommend it because it is an easy, fun read, but it really leaves you hanging.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I'm a big fan of the hidden objects games, but this one has so much to it I can't stop playing it! I both love and hate the way the objects change every time you play a stage and that there are so many different ways to search. In my opinion, this is the best hidden objects games out there.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so elated about Candy Crush Saga being on Kindle Fire bout time whoo thank you so much Amazon I was searching for ,6 + Mos. I was yelling in  joy today playing everyday.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy this app is available on my kindle! I've been hearing about it and I have to say I'm totally hooked. so fun!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Nice cartoony graphics with fun game play.  It is a nice time waster. Don't be scared to try it.  The price is right
0375703764|4.0|Prepare your brain. This book doesn't follow the normal path of linear plotting. It's a very different experience for readers. I'm reading this for a book club, so it should be fun listening to everyone else's experience.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game.  Did not give it 5 stars as it is difficult to get bingo<br />And it is pricier than my other games to buy credits.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Played this game with my kids. It was fun solving the problems. Would like to see more levels. Maybe even a limited amount of turns to make it more challenging.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.  So much fun.  Can't put the game down.  Hate having to wait for life's to regenerate though.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Love this app!  I use it all the time!  Helps me keep track of what's going on.  Would recommend it to all others looking for information.
B00D6B4PUG|2.0|I am not very &#34;techy&#34; and could not sign into my gmail e-mail account; it wanted me to set up a new account???  Didn't even get to try app just deleted the Kindle Tab for Gmail from my Kindle. :(
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  It can be very addictive, very competive, but very much fun!!  I would advise anyone to get this game.
B00F2HW1YY|5.0|It was predawn and the night sky was clear.  The stars, placed in the heavens for all humanity, resilient.  The moon but a crescent yet still reflecting light.  Into this sacred atmosphere I moved.  In each hand a leash that held man's best friend.  As I moved I listened.  Desolation Rose by the Flower Kings.  The first play.  Many songs in found me singing.  Yearning to know the lyrics and music of these magnificent new songs by a beloved progressive band.  Welcome back boys!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Awesome  app!!! Every so often the app freezes and It reboots itself!  Other than that I love playing this game
B007P3TMW2|5.0|I really liked this movie.  The actors and actresses were good, the plot was good, and the ending was good. There was only one thing I thought was odd - the fact that a young boy goes all over New York City alone.  Overall the movie was interesting and worth watching.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I started playing today and am already addicted. Hats waiting for lives, but oh well. I like that the levels change objectives and shapes.
B0081336FO|5.0|the best series i have watched in a long time, maybe ever.  it's just a smart, clever series that takes account everything, every little detail that happens, and adds them up to something even bigger.  it's everything a series could want.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Bought this movie as a gift. The recipient was more than pleased. All star cast, great gay movie. Only shown on HBO.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lots of fun and changeling game .  My daughter has it on her computer and I am glad that I have it now.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|It was war. It was death. It was survival. It was love for his friends ... God Bless our Navy SEALs!
B004Q0SQ24|4.0|My grandson loves anything related to Thomas.  He plays with this train every time he comes to visit.  The color is lasting, no peeling, and this is a solid small toy.
1449305172|5.0|Having previously read Lean Startup as well and Steve Blank's work, I came to this book looking for more concrete advice on how to actually implement a lean startup approach to starting a new business. And indeed, it provided an actionable blueprint for how to proceed, from discovering the customer need to building the analytics and development team you need. Very well done.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I think it's a very good game there's just not enough time, I think they know<br />When your just about to win , because that's when they cut you off.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is really addicting but I enjoy it so much and especially enjoy playing against my friends.<br />I will play it forever.
B00BDZV8R0|5.0|Sounds the same as 1970's.  Young and exciting. Loved it.  My favorite is  Bob Seger and John.  Excellent sound.<br />Awesome.
0525478817|5.0|This is a story about kids with cancer. So as you can imagine, it's incredibly sad and often tough to read. But it's also funny, endearing and uplifting. Frankly, I don't know what to say. It's a great book. 8.5/10.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Why? So much happened in this book series and to have this ending absolutely killed me. This is an amazing book but so unbelievably sad. Anyone can read this book but no one could not cry in the end.<br />Very good but so sad.<br />Perfection.
0316204366|5.0|This is another excellent Malcolm Gladwell book. If you liked his previous books, you'll like this one. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It begins with the most fascinating breakdown of the classic David vs. Goliath fight I've ever read. Not that I've read many, but I was blown away right off the bat. Even if you read nothing else, you should try to read this chapter. It then goes through various David vs. Goliath scenarios. Examples include Vivek Ranadive's girls basketball team finding major success despite a dearth of talent, how dyslexia turned into a strength for some highly successful people, and how so many prominent historical figures have one thing in common -- they lost a parent at an early age. I highly recommend this to anyone other than those who dislike Malcolm Gladwell (and there are many). 9/10.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|Movie was amazing great quality as well. The way it had to be hooked up to the television I was not expecting much and was pleasently suprised.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great series, couldn't stop, watched one after the next. Glued to season five, excellent cast and a great story line.
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|Sydney, Australia.<br /><br />Cecilia Fitzpatrick had never aspired to anything other than ordinariness. She was a typical suburban mum:<br /><br />- everything in her home strictly stacked and labeled;<br />- her children, Isabel, Esther and Polly, on a precision course - perfectly calendered and co-ordinated;<br />- her community life impeccable - President of St Angela's Primary Parents and Citizens Association; and<br />- the Tupperware queen of the region - one of the top eleven sales people in the country.<br /><br />Her daughter Polly controlled the household with her obsessive interest in the Fall of the Berlin Wall.<br /><br />Tess Curtis and her niece, formerly- fat Felicity, were spiritually bonded at the hip since birth, sharing everything. Until Tess was confronted with the ultimate request to share something she held the most dearest. She had to get away. She took her son Liam and flew back home.<br /><br />Rachel Crowley lost her daughter, Janie, to a murder. Embittered, stubborn, resentful and lonely - especially when her son Rob announced his departure to New York with his wife and two-year-old son, she quietly built up a revenge she would unleash one sunny day, but was blinded by hatred, heartbreak and sorrow. Her impulsive action not only blew up in her face, but exploded like an atomic bomb in the community.<br /><br />The families had two things in common: the television program, The Biggest Loser and the St Angela's Primary School.<br /><br />All the husbands in the book are much-loved, much-admired and perfect. Well, most of the time...<br /><br />But one man, Connor Whitby, would put the bubbles in the blood in a hen's pen, when he established himself as the Physical Exercise teacher in the school. Formerly a boring accountant, married to a equally boring ambitious lawyer, he started over by training his body and mind, buying a motorbike, and getting his biceps and six pack pumped up in the gym. The hormonal cocktail he gets stirred up have all the ladies, school girls and mamas in town huffing and puffing in his presence - everyone, except Rachel. Not because she was too old (women are never too old!) but because of her daughter Janie.<br /><br />So, when Pandora toppled a shoe box in Cecilia's attic, and reveal a letter, addressed to her, to only be opened after the death of her husband John-Paul (who was still very much alive), the stage is set for an emotional, mental and physical avalanche of drama, adventure and stupefying endings.<br /><br />I agreed with the ending. In fiction-country it is dumbfounding and might even make a few million revenge-driven mamas very angry, but in reality it was the best decisions. I liked it.<br /><br />You got it right. I adored this book. There's heartbreak, humor and harlots. There's mediocrity, madness and mayhem. But most of all, it was all perfectly stringed together in the rosary of this community's life, which not even the thirty-year-old priest would be able to handle. If he knew what some of these women were thinking in his services, he would have made a run for it!<br /><br />In the end we are left with the possibilities of what could have happened if......<br />Just amazing!<br /><br />This book resonates with millions of women all over the world, staying for several weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This app works great! Easily allows me to keep the game going between both my android device and my computer.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is pretty good and easy to use.  I had trouble with the &amp;#34;test drive&amp;#34; feature (it wouldn't work), so I bought it without knowing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is that the ending had me absolutely fuming mad!
0307394549|5.0|It has some of the best cookie recipe's I have ever made. The dark chocolate cookie with sour cherries is my favorite.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Loved - the love interest Laurent and the descriptions on Cannes and her Atlanta family home. I was completely surprised by the ending.<br />Didn't like - I always hate it when murder mysteries make police look like idiots but that's a minor issue.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love the characters in this story! So touching and funny and real! Enzo, the canine philosopher, has much to teach us about human life.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|ES3 allows you to search for files, multi-select and move or delete files, FTP to your server, view videos and photos, and play music. It does all of this smoothly and intuitively.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very good product! But, it should be compatible with more Apps in the phone (like Chrome browser for example). In the apps that it works, the overall experience is excellent!
B004132HZS|5.0|This is the best ever Sherlock Holmes remake/TV series that exists--in my opinion. I'd recommend these DVDs to any fan of the books.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|If you haven't watched this show its cheeky and interesting as well as really a good series for people who like a little culture and fashion without watching a documentary. The main character is my favourite with a luvable side kick and so on the characters are cliche but in such an amusing twist and spin and alot of character.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Superb. I love Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock. I especially like how elements from the books are mixed together and used.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting!  A lot of people I know play it, some I would never have imagined playing it!  Download it today!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My 4 year old grand daughter had some trouble figuring it out at first. She seems to enjoy it more each time she plays it.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I had to have this CD especially after seeing him perform. Justin Timberlake is so multi-talented and is his music is tantalizing.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I loved this app until I purchased a puzzle. The app no longer works! The program crashes EVERY TIME IT OPENS!!!! I uninstalled the program and tried reinstalling to no avail. Play until the free puzzles run out and NEVER buy a puzzle pack!
B00000JQFL|5.0|I have the album & the cassette. So now I can hear this classic CD in my car. Great memories when I listen to this CD.
B006LSZECO|2.0|What a let down!!! This novel just kind of trailed off, and ended before the story was over. I expected so much more from the characters but they all disappointed and confused me.
B00000I5Y6|4.0|Nice CD..not great but good. The classics of this group are ageless. I could listen to them over and over.
B0089J270U|2.0|It was ok, but nah, wouldn't waste my time or money on it, in my book.  Nothing more to say.
B000G73U5Y|4.0|I was never really a die hard Steely Dan fan, but i did like some of their songs. So, i decided to give this CD a try. Of course i liked the familiar songs like Reeling in the Years, and Nineteen,  but it was the songs that i had not heard that were surprisingly delightful. Like i said previously,i am not a die hard fan...yet i was surprised at the songs this band put out with a mixture of jazz, reggae, and rock. Unique and diverse. Nice CD.
B001BYLFDA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was very entertaining and funny.<br />I would recommend anyone to watch it any time.
B00ERH15WY|4.0|Bad Religion has threatened to put out a Christmas album for years.  Well, they did it.<br /><br />While this will not be in my general playlist due to the nature of the music, it will be kept on my iPod as it's very well done.  The complex riffs, the vocals, it all comes down to a wonderful experience.  It's also great because you can have it playing in your car with your religious family and them hit them with \\"American Jesus\\".<br /><br />The songs also bring back not so fond memories of my childhood indoctrination.  A strong reminder of where I came from and why I am never going back.<br /><br />The whole idea of what is considered to be an atheist band putting out somewhat traditional Christmas music is unusual at best.  I thought it was a joke, but here it is.
0800141660|5.0|I loved the acting and the settings in this beautiful classic.<br />This interpretation of the story is excellent.<br />I strongly recommend it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What another great book by Grisham.  As usual, once I started reading I could not stop.  Somehow I just knew Jake would prevail.  The story was wonderfully done .
B005PK1G76|4.0|Sturdy, cheap, and holds my cups well.  Looks funny on my City Mini GT double, though.  Much cheaper than buying the one made by baby jogger.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Not the ending I had imagined , riveting story, couldn't wait to read what happened next, book club should be interesting
B005HEJ3AM|4.0|By this point in the series you've gotten over Archer's overacting and the fact that this show wades into the realm of Vulcan soft porn. The show continues to bring up interesting ethical issues of exploring space and being exposed to new technologies. It has a good pace and, in this season particularly, the writers have used some alter physics as a mechanism to create divergent and non-linear story lines allowing the audience to be taken through a more suspenseful and complete emotional experience per episode.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love my horse ,it is so awesome, cool game and I will never ever stop playing it til I am dead, trust me , I love this game, my horse is sweet, I love taking care of my horse, and this game reminds me of taking care of my horse and it is fun.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The Battery monitor does exactly as stated in the description, I would recommend this app for the Kindle Fire HD.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Very good game if you love tactics, ships, pirates, and battles. I love this app/game. Hope you all enjoy it like I do.
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|This game is a good pass time kinda game, if your bored it's a good game to play. But in order to play it you have to be focused, or else you will crash and die.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I've really enjoyed this one as it take games like angry birds a step farther. Got it as a free app of the day but since playing it I would definitely pay for it.
1449305172|5.0|There is a lot written about lean startups, but no one addresses the issue with such a clear and useful message as Maurya does...
B000SEGQNS|4.0|Common sense approach to basic interface of a website.  However, there are better references for web 2.0 / responsive design.
0375507256|5.0|A most intriguing and fascinating book, wonderfully crafted. Mitchell captures the literary style of each period with panache and if you can stand 6 stories and a back forth timeline, you'll be well rewarded. There are political, environmental, philosophical and social statements made along the way which provides the novel's stories a more realistic feel and heft.  10-2013
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|A well-crafted release, with superior arrangements.  My favorite \\"The Miracle Hymn\\". a choral chant, draws the listener in; I feel as if I am participating in a communal celebration.<br />  The title song, Home for Christmas steps right out of the forties as Susan sings with a backup of tenors. The mood is exquisitely slow, gentle, soft...Jo Stafford would applaud Susan's revival of this sumptuous style.<br />  You don't have be of any particular faith to appreciate \\"The Lord's Prayer\\" (of no particular faith would describe me).  I always marvel at the beauty of stained glass windows, transmitting an ethereal sentiment, this is the beauty of the Lord's Prayer in Susan's voice.  Susan does what she does best with this song,  long, pure, simple, sustained notes powered by strong belief.<br />  The Little Drummer Boy, I have always liked this song...Susan sings this as a march, a steady, unemotional, progressive march, fueled by bagpipes no less!  This song slowly builds, no emotion, just a steady progression. A single voice attracts disciples as a second military drum joins in, followed by bagpipes and chorus, building with methodical determination until a simple \\"then he smiled at me, me and my drum\\".  Cliff Masterson must be credited with an ingenious arrangement.<br />The duet with Johnny Mathis, When a Child is Born allows both voices to bloom with a subdued arrangement.  Again, the producers know when less is more and the music supports the voices, remaining in the background.  I enjoyed this duet, though I can't say the same for the Elvis duet.<br />Susan's version of \\"I Believe in Father Christmas\\" will be a holiday classic along with the Pogues' \\"A Fairy Tale of New York\\".  Certainly not as sarcastic in nature as the Pogues' cant, there is a wizened protest of the material aspect of the holiday.<br />The songs I have not mentioned have their own appeal, and given more listening time, I'll probably elaborate.<br /><br />The lowdown, this is no quickly spun Christmas album.  The songs evolve from a wide variety of approaches to Christmas music, a march, a cant, a choral, a simple hymn (The Lord's Prayer), and the slightly sultry cocktail, \\"Home for Christmas\\".  Susan masters each approach and  with her unmistakeable instrument she creates an album of faith resolute.
B000002IPZ|2.0|This album is for the most part for people who enjoy thrash metal. I bought it for a couple of good videos I saw which to me are the only 2 good songs on the album.That's just my opinion. I know other folks probably love this album. It's just not for me.

B007BLCGNU|5.0|This film is one of Eastwood's best directorial efforts, with its cool, detached mise-en-scene and muted, paled out monochrome cinematography (not warm colors, but cold, glassy grays and gun metal blues; the period set and costume designs are on target but not at all engaging as is any episode of \\"Boardwalk Empire\\", which is as accurate but titillatingly so, and thus the violence in \\"Boardwalk\\" is aestheticized like a Smithsonian diorama come to bloody life; I believe \\"Boardwalk\\" could have been influenced by \\"J Edgar\\"}. Instead, Eastwood makes that verisimilitude of Hoover's world seem like an absolute alien place, somewhat nauseatingly uncanny. This is fitting, since the past literally IS an alien place we did not live in. The violence of \\"J Edgar,\\" unlike \\"Boardwalk,\\" is mostly implied (fleeting and few are the scenes that let us see it, such as the savage beating by Hoover's agents of a communist in a bomb factory that the FBI raids), so the violence, I felt, is all the more horrifying because instead of seeing it, we get to FEEL it as it insinuates itself through the prism of a psychotic protagonist into our democracy, souring freedom and liberty and dissent with Hoover's pathetic paranoia and self righteousness. The violence ultimately is not physical but cultural and political: America is taken apart by this man, and we imagine, all the men like him; taken apart piece by piece and one blackmailed president at a time until in the end both Hoover and the United states Bill of Rights are misshapen, twisted, bloated, stiffened to a sclerotic and arthritic crawl across the rooms of the offices shown on the screen.<br /><br />What a horror film. I was caught off guard by just how horrified it made me feel. DiCaprio is perfect for the role of Hoover, because DiCaprio has always even in the full blush of his brat pack youth (the pansy 'Romeo and Juliette' romp he did years back, for instance and that insipid 'Titanic' crap that made him a celebrity) he always had a barely discernible thickness about the jaw and neck that came to the fore in \\"Gangs of New York\\" and then leaped full up in his face in later films), and the weight of his increasing gravitas as an actor (His work with Scorsese, for certain!) comes through roaring as his Hoover characterization ages, thickens, and fills out. It's like the Sinatra transformation America saw from the thin youth-fullness of Frank in \\"From Here to Eternity\\" to a hardened, round headed aging Frank in \\"The First Deadly Sin.\\" It is stunning to see DiCaprio get aged and transformed as Hoover--as if we are looking at DiCaprio tapping into some part of HIMSELF that he will age into naturally in his own future.<br /><br />Supporting roles are competent here, but the tour de force is DiCaprio, and he carries them all, carries the production itself, across the finish line on his own two shoulders. It seems fitting. The monster who was Hoover did much the same with the real FBI: in his evolution into a golem. This film only benefits from Eastwood's decision to let everything in it, from actors to set and costume design, to soundtrack, to cinematography, revolve around DiCaprio's gradual transformation from a callow, awkward, virgin youth to an old, closeted, shuffling but shrewd manipulator of men's souls.<br /><br />Yes, I admit, as much as I am raving about this film I punked out, I couldn't finish it; it made me feel so horrified that, like watching the Zupruder film, you might have to turn away before the morbid, terrible end of it when Kennedy's head blows apart and lovely Jackie Kennedy scrambles across the back of the limo, no, NOT trying to save herself but horribly, trying to retrieve the pieces of her husband's head. It's real, it's true, but after a lifetime of seeing the Zupruder film I can no longer watch it all the way to the end. I had to stop watching \\"J. Edgar\\" for the same reason--I baied out on the final twenty minutes. I mean that as a tribute to this film, however, not a rebuke. It was so real, so true, so terrible, that I couldn't bear it. What greater achievement can we expect from real art works?e. It was so real, so true, so terrible, that I couldn't bear it. What greater achievement can we expect from real art works?
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is such an amazing book.  I hear Ender's Shadow is also good (if not better), so that is next on my list to read. So excited for the movie, too!
006202406X|1.0|Here's what it seems like to me.  Ms. Roth had all the time in the world to write Divergent and she got it right.  Not flawless, but right all the same.  Then it feels like the publisher came in and said \\"you have to give us 3 books.\\"  So Insurgent while not bad, felt like filler.<br /><br />*Spoilers from here on out*<br /><br />As for this debacle of a novel...what a rush job.  I think it could have been okay if she'd spent some time polishing it, but in this form it was a disaster.  Never mind killing off Tris or the wussy whiner she turned Tobias into.  Are we honestly suppose to believe that Evelyn, a woman that faked her own death and left her child alone with an abuser, would give up her empire because said son that she willingly abandoned asks her to?  And Marcus who would stop at nothing to gain power just rolls over because Joanna says so?<br /><br />Or how about the fact that all of the bad guys get a happy ending, but the two characters we are most invested in, Tris and Tobias, get shafted.<br /><br />The reason other series like Hunger Games, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc. work is because the author stays true to both the story and characters they've built.  Ms. Roth went so far off the rails on both accounts that this book is nothing more than a failure.
0812416317|2.0|This book is a miniature book. Its almost like a pocket book. Its very small if you were expecting a normal size book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great colors. It is Highly addictive. Highly competitive. It also gives you the opportunity to be generous to your friends.
B00DFR99WA|5.0|Since I love all things Nicholas Sparks, this movie about one of his books just had to be good. Also being a romantic, this was a perfect choice. I loved the surprise ending! Julianne Hough has always been a favorite of mine as well. So happy I purchased this. I will be watching this again and again.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is a great way to re-connect to old friends and to update photos from friends and relatives that you don't get to see very often.
B002V092B0|5.0|Dr. Jill Bolte Talylor's history is amazing  and the analysis she makes of such a hard situation inspired me.  It is a must-read book for those who face a similar health problem in the family.  She gave voice to those who suffered a stroke, a powerful and merciful voice.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I hated the ending for Hunger Games, but this was so much worse. The plot was almost non-existent, with too much inner contemplation by Tris and Tobias.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this in high school and recently retread it. I enjoyed it then but it definitely made more sense as an adult.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this app so much! I highly recommend it. Every time my 6 year old cousin comes over she asked if she can do my Kindle' s hair.
B00BSW29OE|5.0|You become one of the thousand citizens of Hiroshima on the morning of August 6,1945 when a new and unique weapon appears to have been dropped on the city. You do not know what has happened and it will take weeks to put together the pieces as you struggle to understand what &#34;total war&#34; really means.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|At first glance, you might get the impression this is a cheesy cartoonish game just for preschoolers. Not so. I have found this game to be somewhat interesting from a technical viewpoint, and quite a bit of fun to play. I haven't played it much yet, but I did find what might be a problematic bug. While going through the training levels, I kept having a problem ( on the orbiting level) with the rocket spinning out of control as soon as the throttle was applied. The spinning stops just before the rocket runs out of fuel and I have to start the process all over again. I followed the tutorial exactly, with no success. Perhaps I'll try this game on a different tablet and see if it works any better. The problems I'm having are on an original Kindle Fire. Could be that developers just aren't optimizing apps to work on these outdated devices anymore, since I don't think Amazon updates the operating system on these things.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The book ends in a way I've not exactly seen an author do before. Salvages a middle school level series about totalitarianism and distopia, into something that will stick with you after you complete the final page. Felt like it should have been longer, that she confined herself to so few pages. Over all, would read again some time down the road.
B00EOGZ42U|1.0|This game is, to say the least, boring. It seems like everything is in slow motion. I have this on a Nexus 7 tablet and it works fine, but jeez. I first got the free trial version and thought it was interesting. I (wrongly) thought there would be much more to the paid version of the game. The game MIGHT be more interesting on a 24&quot; or larger computer monitor so you can see what's going on without having to zoom in and out all the time on a tablet screen. It must be purely horrible on a phone. Most of the time playing is spent watching tiny specks (seeds) slowly move from one circle (Asteroid) to another. Then you plant a seed, and wait, and wait, and wait, then wait some more, until your plants have produced enough seeds to take over the next Asteroid. If you like extremely slow moving games, then by all means get it. But if you want anything more exciting than watching paint dry, please avoid it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It's interesting to read a book that highlights the isolation of the gifted mind. In this case very literally with Ender Wiggin. For anyone who has ever been trapped in the isolation of their own mind, Ender's Game is a must read. The all too real internal struggle of balancing the influences of good and evil play out in a very literal sense with Ender, and despite doing what he feels is best for all humanity, he struggles with the morality of his choices. The reader must question their own moral stance in current times, regardless of what those times are.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun, reminds me of Temple Run but with more upgrades and levels. Oh and it's free, you should give it a try!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it. It's very funny and a lots of fun to play with I play for hours and hours

0141394811|5.0|Morrissey's biography might have been made first available, as good study books are, properly stitched in hardback with an index; rather than suffering the big print-run obsequies with which Penguin favour the works of Homer, in their \\"Classic\\" series.  The Folio Society, one day will give our hero the cemetery gates and the Robert Graves treatment. Larder Dah Da.<br /><br />NME familiars have just declared that \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" is the greatest album of all time. Lou Reed died yesterday. Such news pales behind the revelation that Johnny Marr's favourite band was Pentangle. Earnestly supported by an early incarnation of the perverse John Peel; and by a Melody Maker that still dreamed of a return of \\"big bands\\"; with \\"Light Flight\\" Pentangle had just one hit. From the song's chorus: \\"Ba - da - pa do da; da - ba - pa do da da\\"; Morrissey himself doubtless, learned how to spurn the source of inspiration and fill in for words that he'd never know. We can check out this group now on a computer; and hear that irritating song; and observe that The Smiths might have learned that Pentangle had something more to teach about the rapacious record industry alongside their intricate guitar chords and the circle of fifths. \\"Transatlantic withheld royalty payments from the Pentangle albums... their manager, made it clear that their contract with him included a clause that they could not sue him \\"for anything under any circumstances\\"\\". It is a side of the record business that John Peel never mentioned once in the many years I courted him for direction. Peel should never more be associated with the early success of The Smiths. Morrissey came across the disingenuous presenter \\"two times, and both in motorway service stations but he shyly has nothing to say on both occasions\\". It is revealed that Peel never saw the band once live or attended their fabled radio broadcasts. John Walters is given the credit.<br /><br />Beyond the many palpable record label injustices, \\"Biography\\" makesclear, that manager Geoff Travis held back release of \\"The Queen is Dead\\" for nine months to establish that \\"Hatful of Hollow\\", enhanced as it was with underpant blue, (Pantone 284) was not to be regarded as an album under contract. The contributions of drummer and bass player deserve the heartfelt praise that Morrissey favours them with throughout the book; but only a judge, beyond the pale, could decree that they deserve the same royalties as Morrissey and Marr. This is judgment that, in selling Van Gogh, the forebears of Daler-Rowney were entitled to benefit because they were instrumental in furnishing the artist with canvas.  The damage done to Morrissey by this injustice; and the pain of legal wrangles, is never far away.  Yet, Morrissey can bleat about how the world treats him; he can harp on that Rough Trade Records spared promotion back in the beginning; but only Morrissey could besmirch his own canvas with \\"Kill Uncle\\". If he'd not been so tasteless, misguided or appalling at this critical time in his solo career he could have met the future demands of Mike Joyce out of petty cash.  In fairness Morrissey does apologise for spawning this monstrosity; he can \\"forgive\\" Mike Joyce but Morrissey is incapable of crediting Joyce with listening to the words. The drummer turned out to be a shop-lifter after all.<br /><br />\\"They're writing songs of love but not for me\\".  Morrissey describes himself, at the close of his often hilarious opus as one who presents himself \\"everywhere by way of apology\\". The feeling of being left out has often been celebrated but, until Morrissey's lyrics, and to a fault in \\"Autobiography\\", never so earnestly defended.  Emily Dickinson, another \\"funny Valentine\\", advised that truth, always a little hard to grasp, should be presented \\"slant\\". More profligate, Morrissey prefers telling it \\"like it is\\". He reveals a confidence given him personally by the mother of Lesley Ann Downey: Emlyn Williams who wrote \\"Beyond Belief\\", an important bookfor Morrissey, about The Moors Murderers, asked for a sample of the murdered girl's knickers.  While for a moment this is riveting, the truth is, and this is made clear in the best writing in the book; the basis of Morrissey's art is REVENGE disguised as truth-telling and \\"love\\". This change of heart towards Emlyn Williams makes him feel guilty; but what is disturbing is not that he likes this feeling, but offers it up like a sacrifice, as entertainment.<br /><br />Along with Rolling Stone magazine; Sarah Ferguson; The Algonquin Hotel cockroaches and Johnny Depp; Sandie Shaw's mean slice of toast is castigated. Siouxsie is, at length, dismissed with entertaining relish: \\"she might stare you out as you lay dying on a zebra crossing\\".  Morrissey raises his game for the section on Julie Burchill \\"pitifully late-middle-aged legs (no chance of a Rich Tea biscuit)\\"; and Marc Bolan is reminded, where he is looking down with Stacey Grove from Heaven that he declared \\"Oooh no!\\" when our nubile biographer summoned the effrontery to ask for an autograph.  However, perhaps on legal advice from Penguin \\"the failed Manchester musician under an assumed name\\" is not named.<br /><br />The final words of the actual text of Morrissey's proud work of art are:<br /><br />\\"A wintry Chicago street scene in December 2011....As I board the tour bus, a fired encore is still ringing in my ears, and then suddenly a separated female voice calls out to me - full of cracked now-or-never embarrassment above the still Illinois winter atmosphere of midnight, and it was dark, and I looked the other way\\".<br /><br />In \\"Broken Time\\", one of the first books to be written about his lover dying of \\"Aids\\", the author's last words are: \\"this calamity that is all mine\\". We speak in rhyme at moments of passion, and moments of departure and death. I wonder if even the poet knew how much of himself he has given away, still ill, as he kissed his own remarkable work, goodbye once more, over and over: \\"still Illinois\\".
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Excellent. A bit hard to follow at first, but well worth sticking with it.  A scary version of a possible future.
B00FQU93OS|5.0|The old and the new. I can't get enough of the Seether style. Keep it turned up loud and enjoy it with good head bob action, I know I will.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Fun game...probably as close to a mobile version of KSP as you can get.  it actually has a better tutorial than ksp which would be good for beginners.  Just wish there was a bit more parts.  Awesome FAOTD
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Bought this for my son. He always wanted a dress watch. Had to remove several links which was fairly easy, about five minutes using a watch repair kit. It turns out he wares it everyday to school and work.  He is very happy with the style and I am very happy with the price
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is very fun but lacks on having more levels even if you had to pay for them it would be worth it the same 4 levels get very boring very quickly but some how you can't stop playing I do have to say that it is fun but needs more levels and maybe more free stuff to upgrade like maybe turbo button or slow motion to collect more bananas or this would be fun for Halloween turn for Dr jeckle to Mr hide or Christmas turn from nice Santa to evil Santa or reindeer instead of fluffy horse come on guys have some imagination
B000BD0P38|1.0|Rip off alert! Item not new and would not play on either of my DVD's. This is the second time I have ordered this DVD through Amazon. #1. never came from Bargain Bear and #2 from Movie Mars did not play. Maybe Amazon should look at who they allow to sell through them. Too bad, this was a pretty good movie as I recall.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I though this book was very funny. Less pictures would be nice, and more explaining would help a lot with the story line. If I had one hint for Jeff Kenny on how to write his next book, it would be to not change the story so often, then a few pages later go back to the same story and keep switching off. GREAT BOOK!!!😃😃😃😃
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|A wonderful book with great characters that you want to follow until the end.  Expect to read the book in one sitting as you will not be able to put it down and expect to cry a lot but also laugh a lot.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|As soon as I read the synopsis of this book, I said to myself \\"I freaking need to read this!\\" And so here I am, ready to tell the world how much I enjoyed reading this awesome book.<br /><br />First, I'd like to congratulate Ms. Kelly for writing a hookable book. Others may say that this book is cheesy, cliche and unrealistic. Those people just can't appreciate the beauty of this book. It totally hooked me from the first page until the very last one. It was a fun experience for me.<br /><br />Well, can I say that I've got a huge crush on Connor Reed? Yep, you read that right. :) The guy's just so .... *thinks of the right word to describe him* *le sigh* I really can't find a word to describe him. But let me tell you, Connor Reed is every girl's dream guy. I'm so willing to marry a guy like him! He's the man!<br /><br />If you guys are looking for some light reading and just want some fluffy stuff then this book is the right one for you. Go read Waking Up Married and feel free to squeal over the cuteness of this book!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is amazing !  I recommended it for my book club and everyone loved it too. It seems like it's a love story at first but there is a huge twist throughout making it very hard to put down !
B00BXI0IHS|3.0|I enjoyed the detail about the botany, the geographical excursion and the historical detail.  I, however, struggled with the story of Alma. I would have loved a little more physical passion with someone for her to love.  I kept hoping for more....
B009WO7NQO|5.0|A lot more &#34;Birds&#34; and different and more fun and seems easier to eliminate. All the structures and easier to take down.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|When one has read years of someone's blog for free and still pre-orders their book just so they can have an easier way to reference material from that writer, then I think it is safe to say it is worth the time to review the work. People don't even realize \\"All The Things\\" that came from this lady's brilliant mind, but they will now, and I, for one, hope she keeps writing - because the world is a happier, funnier place as a result of her work.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush and I have been waiting for this game to be on my kindle. Now I can save the battery on my phone. Lol.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Pacific Rim is a classic monster movie.  The plot is a bit weak, but it is internally consistent and scenery chewing is the name of the game in &#34;B&#34; movies anyway.  The Kaiju and Jaegers smash cities left and right and the hand-to-claw combat is well done which is something Toho always had a problem with.  The money they spent (~$100M) is up there on the screen to see.  The IMAX 3-D was especially impressive.  The US box office was low for a &#34;big&#34; summer action movie, but Pacific Rim is doing really well overseas.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Mr. Kyle was a true American. He did for his country what he felt he had to do and did it more than once. My Grandson told me about this book so I had to get it and I am not sorry I did. I'm only sorry that Chris got murdered and by someone he was trying to help. Everyone should read this to know just what these SEALS and other branches of the armed forces do and the chances they take for us.
B00CL151G4|5.0|The writers for Elementary like to use throwaway lines based on the original Sherlock Homes novels.  They are sometimes quite sly about how they do it; including getting the lines wrong.  However, this is a universe where there was no fictional or real turn-of-the-century &#34;consulting detective&#34; by the name of Holmes.  The series is well done and the characters are both true to and different (in a twenty-first century way) from the &#34;historical records&#34;.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have heard so much about keeping the brain active as we age, this will indeed do the trick.  I don't pay for extra lives, I keep working until I solve it.  That, at times, has taken a couple of weeks.  I also like the fact that because the lives are limited, once you are out of them you have to quit until they are refreshed.  Which means you are not sitting around all day playing the game.  It's a good balance.  I have it on my phone and now have it on my Kindle.  Great way to keep those brain cells active.

0345529057|5.0|I loved the show.. regretfully I was not aware of the book series until the show premiered. The books are well written, and profoundly captivating. I read the first 4 books in two months, it was what I did every spare minute until they were done. I plan to get the hard covers for posterity, and the MMP for carrying and reading. The story is just fantastic, if you are a history buff you will love this series. Being the geek I am, I found that I frequently had to remind myself that I could not research the events as this was in fact fiction. ridiculous , I know. Read these books and you will probably find yourself doing the same thing. The show is as true to the book as time and budget allows. I should point out I very rarely read fiction.

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I enjoyed the Mistborn series and Way of Kings more than Steelheart, but Steelheart is still a very fun, fast paced book to read.  The beginning hooked me from the start, and I couldn't put it down after that.  Always a good sign!!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|and approached the movie with trepidation.  Needn't have.  The movie is wonderful!  It took me awhile to integrate it.  It has captured the soul of the book, but it took a few viewings to realize that.  I think this movie has been so underrated because it is so complex.  Every time I've seen it I see more layers.  I think it's a brilliant adaptation of a book that I never expected to see on film. It is becoming one of my all time favorites.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this and got me hooked. I play just ad much as they do. Just wish that this allowed you to tilt to shift surfer over from tail to rail fingers hurt after awhile.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|How I love a novel that is both intimate and sweeping, especially when both are well done! And I truly appreciate that this novel conveys the scientific mind as one of abiding curiosity, and that Gilbert shared her appreciation for the great questions of natural history in the 19th century. I appreciate that really good writing combined with really good story-telling. I was not expecting Gilbert to be able to pull this off--I was not a fan of her Go Girl confessional style in Eat PrayLove, but that is absent in Signature. I recommend this novel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is great I love building things I especially love the new updates great thing that in one of them they even added a yellow text and a Sun great game must get!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0984999302|4.0|I'm a turn-around specialist working in a late stage start up company, and I found the information in this guide very helpful.  As the author suggests, the book is not to read through all in one sitting, but rather to be used as a reference guide when confronting or considering various aspects of new and growing businesses.  Very helpful insights from experienced business people.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Do not pass this book up. I loved it! The story lines come together so well and how the different people are connected. I like the fact that you find out the husband's secret early on instead of waiting until the end of the book. Without giving anything away the greatest thing about this book is that you will feel conflicted by it. Enjoy!!!
1609613937|5.0|I recieved the book in just a few days from the seller and began reading immediatley. The recipes are easy and quick and delicious. Dr. McDougall's writing style is easy to follow and comprehend. What he has to say makes sense. We have been led astray for many years by the government and those industries that depend on government subsidies. I enjoy the recipes, I know that I will be spending less for groceries and regaining my health. I have already lost 5 pounds in the last two weeks. I also purchased The McDougall Quick&Easy Cookbook which has over 300 recipes in it.

B00004UEDQ|5.0|[[ASIN:6305692572 When a Man Loves a Woman]], [[ASIN:B00ECW9WTW Stuart Saves His Family]], [[ASIN:B000ERVK4Y My Name Is Bill W]], 28 Days portray the hurt to others (children, parents, caring others, even anonymous fans) caused by compulsive behavior (spending, rumination, sugar, junk food, candy, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, benzodiazepines, painkillers, muscle relaxants, sex, talking, TV, marijuana, kava-kava, recreational chemicals, self deception) hidden under a veil of laughter. Writer Susannah Grant, director Betty Thomas, and cast researched their ensemble comedy by living in rehabilitation facilities. Ubiquitous Guitar Man Loudon Wainwright III plays and sings emotionally pertinent lyrics while standing behind the action as a Greek chorus [ASIN:6305291470 Mighty Aphrodite] Woody Allen. In the forefront is the fake soap opera Santa Cruz (commentary on popular culture available in its entirety on this disc in Special Features) addictively watched by the entire rehab community of the movie.<br /><br />Makeupless Diane Ladd portrays self denigrating, humiliated wife of an emotionally abusive philanderer. Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Roshanda hides her British accent, delivers a druggie's aggressive front, until during family therapy her young daughter and son tell her how her addictive behavior affects them. This scene is reminiscent of Jess the child in When a Man Loves a Woman who explains to her father Michael (Andy Garcia) \\"you are supposed to hold the bottle in a paper bag to drink\\" describing her mother Alice (Meg Ryan), [[ASIN:B00GPWEPZ8 Saving Mr. Banks]] Tom Hanks Emma Thompson story about Mary Poppins, [[ASIN:B00H7LJ2UO August: Osage County]] Meryl Streep Julia Roberts Sam Shepherd.<br /><br />In 28 Days Sandra Bullock's character has flashbacks of her alcoholic mother, exciting, entertaining, frightening, amnestic, behavior similar to her own character Gwen Cummings a journalist partying with boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West) borrowing money from her sister played by Elizabeth Perkins, until she destroys her sister's wedding with drunken disregard for the feelings of everyone. Judge offers choice of jail or rehab. Gwen chooses rehab until she decides continued partying with Jasper is more fun. When she is confronted with the jail alternative which she has chosen, Bullock's Gwen is able to lie \\"I can quit, I don't have a problem, I can't go to jail\\" until she can't. Steve Buscemi is stellar as Gwen's drug counselor Cornell, willing to narrate his own life violations of other's rights as we watch Gwen vainly trying to retrieve a bottle of prescription painkillers she had discarded.<br /><br />Azura Skye plays a 17 year old heroin addict Andrea, Gwen's roommate, who uses chocolate and self cutting as dysfunctional coping skills. The addiction drives continued use with statistical consequences. Gwen teaches her roomie to fold a chewing gum paper wrapper chain to keep her hands busy instead of self mutilation. The disc has instructions on how to make the chewing gum paper chain. Gwen and Andrea clearly depict the tremor of addicts in remission.<br /><br />Alan Tudyk is hilarious throughout. Especially in the Santa Cruz parody which the residents devise as a going away theatrical for Andrea. The emotional pain of leaving rehabilitation, with its safety, literature, lectures, 24/7 activities, monitoring, security and social support is well portrayed. What isn't seen is the financial burden of residential treatment.<br /><br />Various forms of therapy are seen: equine therapy (use of horses to detect intention), climbing therapy (trust of others), group therapy (confrontation by others who are just like you), family therapy (pain), restricted access to mind altering chemicals (caffeine), outdoor therapy. And the shame and stigma associated with trying to get help: baseball player Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortensen) is approached by adoring young fans for his autograph. When Eddie tries to get an autograph from his idolFalcon (see this denouement after the final credits are complete at the end of the DVD) he is again humiliated.<br /><br />Trying to act against the permanent neurobehavioral alterations in the brain caused by compulsive behaviors and brain cell killing chemicals, is a moment to moment struggle well filmed in this bucolic North Carolina setting.<br /><br />The repeated relapses from rehabilitation are seen through the eyes of the residents, as well as returning patients.<br /><br />The movie is laugh out loud funny, which makes watching easier since the subject matter is so intense. Stopping use is only the beginning of the work of change. Gwen realizes she has only taken a first step on the road of life, which everyone has to walk. The yellow brick road to a rescuer Wizard is an illusion which only circles back around to the self, again and again, as the person who has to do the work remains inside. Ruby Slippers notwithstanding.<br /><br />It isn't all about other people, its about us, all of us, with bad breath, smelly feet, underarm odor and all the other frailties of human existence. When we are finally able to see us as a unit, we begin to heal. The gifts and talents offered and received are the same: listening, insight, honesty, candor, asking for help.

B00DXP7L88|5.0|Spoiler...<br /><br />I did feel that things were wrapped up a bit quickly; with that said, if one thinks about who Dexter became, his remaining life was a perfectly miserable life.  Death would have been too easy...cowardly.  I thought this was a brilliant ending!  Kudos to the actors!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Unbelievable but a true story. My wife and i have watched it many time. It is a sad story but hard to believable that it could be true.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had no idea that this book would end up being a good as it was.  The way it started off had me going in a different direction.  However, midway through the book peaked my interest.  Great book!  I loved it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I love this game. It makes me very mad to known that I have to pay real money to buy some weapons. $100 for game money so I can have a good gun, goofy. I should be able to earn it when I level up or whatever. Won't be playing much longer sorry to say
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A fitting end to a saga that has spanned decades. Robert Jordan can now rest in piece at the table of Tolkien.
B008EL25LE|5.0|I can't stop playing this game!  I wish there were more levels.  I've moved on to the Medals Challenges & am stuck; I'll have to look online for some tips.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan's voice just keeps getting better and better. So crystal clear and expressive. Beautiful songs from a beautiful, talented, gracious and humble lady. The duet with Johnny Mathis, \\"When a Child is Born\\", is much more than just sublime. It brought tears to my eyes the minute Susan started singing the opening phrase. All the songs are beautiful. There's a sweetness to Susan's voice in these songs. It's a little different than her previous CD's. The whole album has a very festive feel, lighthearted and uplifting. It's  what we have come to expect from Susan Boyle, the lady with the most beautiful and versatile voice I have ever heard. She is simply magnificent as a singer and as person.
1449305172|5.0|This book is the how to manual for running your lean startup. Ash shares his detailed step-by-step approach to finding a problem worth solving and to building a product really solving it. He even shares his interview outlines and other gems, which get you through the whole process.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The product is fantastic. Hookup was simple and straight forward.Child's lay.<br />Yes,I would indeed recommend it to family and friends.
B004JK61K0|1.0|this program didn't help me get my email from my cox account...it would retrieve anything and it is very frustrating
B00BU18U82|4.0|You gather wheat,and corn decide if you are going to sale or store the product.You drive the equipment all over the farm.It's fun, but it's hard to play.
B00007LTIL|5.0|I've heard raves about this album and have just bought it for the first time. &#34;Truckin&#34; was the only song that I was familiar with but I loved every other track just as much.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a game that you have to think about the moves you make. YOU CAN SEE ON THE BOARD HOW YOUR FRIENDS ARE DOING. You can ask your friends to send you  extra moves and tickets for  different games. .I Enjoy playing  !!!!!!
B000E6EHGI|5.0|I've been curious about this album for years, but had never listened to it or bought it until recently. I was familiar with the cover artwork for years and the music here is very good, even with the weirdness of &#34;Blues For Allah/Sand Castles....&#34;.
B00FQ272ZI|1.0|we've just seen this film at our local film festival and I was really looking forward to it. It's hard to see how, given the materials they had to hand, they could make something so dreadful;  truly a sailing film written by a finite number of hydrophobic monkeys.  The best bits made me laugh, most of it made me cringe.<br />Particularly notable is the boat rolling in a manner usually associated with a kayak, a knife that is able to cut away standing rigging that would usually need bolt-croppers and a sextant that apparently allows you to determine your position without changing the angle of the mirrors (or, indeed, reading the angle after you've taken the sight). I admit that I was always fond of playing with my boat in the bath, and this may have made me hyper-critical, but I don't remember these sort of errors in Captain  Pugwash. Were it just technical sillys, then the film might be bearable, but the character and his responses to the various problems that befall him are are equally flawed.
0142403873|5.0|We really enjoy this book and have been thinking about buying some of the other Gruffalo books. The rhyming is good and it's a fun story for my kid and I.
B00E8S2GJI|4.0|The original movie is great. However little was added to the &#34;extended edition&#34; to make it worth buying another disc set.  I purchased the digital copy to check this out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins does it again. Mockingjay the third and final book of the hunger games is wonderful. It's very good. I've read it twice and it's just as good. I would advise this book to anyone 13 or older it has some graphic descriptions. But is a really super great book.<br /><br />Read the first two books before this one.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Nice game.  I have just a couple of complaints.  One is that the energy refill takes too long.  It makes the pause between game play kind of annoying.  The other is the ammo - specifically getting the hollow point rounds.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun puzzle game well done.  Simple user interface, easy controls and a gentle harp sound when you complete a puzzle.<br />Only thing I would ask for is a smooth soundtrack underneath or ability to play your own music.<br />Kudos
006202406X|5.0|*******I'm not going to give major spoilers, but please do not read on if you don't want to see even hints as to the ending.*****<br /><br />I thought story was a fitting end to the story set in the world of Divergent.  The true meaning of divergent was interesting.  I found myself caring even more about the characters that had smaller parts in the previous two books. This is a Dystopian novel.  Anyone who expects a truly happy ending, is only fooling themselves.  I too would have liked for certain things to have happened at the end.  But, the ending we got was realistic, emotional, and fitting for the world we have all become emerged in.  Give it time to settle and consider the literary excellence that comes from avoiding a cliche`.  If there had been a truly happy ending, there would be commenters complaining that Roth took the easy way out.  I enjoyed the raw, emotional ride. I was shocked, saddened, but overall satisfied with the reading experience.  I didn't want to stop reading and all of the loose ends were pretty well tied up.
B000SEFM6K|4.0|Good reading but at the same time a little wordy, but I enjoyed it.  I happen to catch an old movie made from this book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|While this book was well written, I now know that there is nothing in it that I care to add to &#34;who I am&#34;.<br />I was drawn by the unknown terror just as poor Anastasia, taken where I never should've gone and left empty and wasted.<br />This is a book that adds nothing of value to a lay persons life. To the contrary it will likely rob innocence and leave the reader feeling dark and heavy. This is how I feel after reading this book.<br />I am saddened by the thought that the deviant has moved from the private shelves of psychiatry to the public shelves of the masses.
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|great. its widescreen and hd. great picture. better than watching in movie theater when it came out. special effects a little dated but probably excellent for that time.
B00DW1WR14|3.0|Kind of like when the reviews came out, people were saying this was like Pearl Jam's &#34;Classic Rock&#34; album.  It kind of is.  It's all right, a very competent album.  It seems like when the live versions come out, these songs will sound a lot better.  This album is all right, though.  Pearl Jam have a mountain to add this too.  If you didn't know anything about Pearl Jam, it would probably not turn you on to them.  But because you know that Pearl Jam is a great band, you kind of let this one go.  I feel like I should've waited to pick this up used somewhere and saved a few bucks.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|WOW!  This game is so addictive.  It is a joy to play a game suitable for all ages.  Let's see how far I can go.
B002N3GD2Q|5.0|I love these albums and listen to them more often than I ever thought I would.  The set really shows how wildly their set can vary from night to night- even from show to second show on the same night!  But man, when people say how great the Doors were, they're talking about nights like these.  The show on Disk 3 is so great- perhaps one of my favorite live recordings of any band.  It is worth buying this set just for that set.  This is the Doors at their peak, for sure.  It is too bad that the bulk of their live recordings were from this tour because a lot of these shows have similar sets but this is THE one to get.  This one and perhaps the Pittsburgh show.  That's a great one too.  The Doors were on fire for these shows.  Great stuff!
1449305172|5.0|Running Lean is a must read for every startup. It highlights the two crucial questions for every entrepreneur. The first being \\" do I have a problem worth solving?\\"  And the second being \\" do I have a product people want to buy?\\". So simple,  yet so vital. Looking forward to the next book.
B000Q3648S|5.0|I've owned this album for a long time & after seeing Sonic Youth perform Daydream Nation a few years ago at the Greek, I was blown away.  That show was probably the most impressive music performance I've ever seen.  Yet, the show the package with the album, which isn't remixed or anything, isn't that great.  It starts off good but is kind of boring.  I wish they had included a performance from when they played it all the way through because it was WAY better.  If there's a bootleg out there of it, please let me know because I'd love to get one.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|I have been very disappointed in a lot of the children's book graphics for eBooks. This one is awesome full screen. Worth the purchase. We really enjoyed the book and it fit into the day's lesson plan. Quick downloads for instant use is what I love about eBooks.
B00000889Y|5.0|I love this album & wish it was the remixed versions because the songs are a bit thin sounding compared to the beautiful remixes they did to their first album & Psychedelic Jungle.  It is still a great collection.  A friend had it in college & for some reason I was thinking about it & bought it.
044654146X|4.0|Interesting book, Good to know,Young Nation made it big time, Agotrip all the way, But All is True as well !!!
B005N95JA4|5.0|I love this album and the second disk is fantastic.  Such great songs.  I love how they wrote all these country songs during the Some Girls sessions.  This is a must have!  One of the greatest albums of all time.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|This was a fun read and I had a good time with this book. I would not consider is amazing or anything, I thought the writing was ok and the story was interesting.<br />The last 20 or 30 pages of the book was kind of anti climatic, for the book pretty much ended 30 pages ago and the rest was just filler.<br /><br />This book is a fast read as the mysteriousness of the story grabs you.
1449305172|5.0|I found this book full of practical insights for actionable steps for the Lean Startup methodologies. Running Lean is a great companion to [[ASIN:0307887898 The Lean Startup]] and fills in all the gaps about putting the ideas to use. Most marketing books I read when I have time always putting them down over and over again, but this one, I was counting the minutes until I could get back to it. It's been a great resource for my business.<br /><br />Ash did a superb job with Running Lean. I can't wait for his next book.
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|Huge fiona fan.... just didn't get this cd at all, too bad I was looking forward to some great music, I couldn't get through this cd twice
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Very easy to use no much to say about this item just plug n transfer your photos . I would recommend this to anyone .
B000002UJQ|5.0|Great record, great band, just something cool to have on in the background of a get together/party. Would highly recommend having for anyone's cd collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool awesome game loveable fun running very fun supper learning crazy fun spray pant and the best way of having fun video games and I think the world is not the best with out this game
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was very well written and brought out things of war that I never imagined. I really liked readying the insets of Taya and her feelings as Chris described his experiences. As a result of this writing, my eyes have been opened and I will be forever grateful for our men in uniform and their heroism and bravery on the battlefield. May God Bless them all and their families. Sharon Hammond, Mulberry, Fl. USA
B007TKBE40|5.0|Look. Short and simple: This guy's the real deal. These songs are so catchy and loaded with talent. It's a darn shame that artists like this are stuck in the shadows. Support this teacher-gone-singer!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I would like to request a do over.  Please!  I am not a picky reader and not a technical one either, but this book just didn't fit.  As a reader, I feel the author let us down.  Why get us invested in these characters and then make it so easy for us not to even care about them or even feel like they are the same people as they were in the first two.  Character's chapters read the same.  Should have kept it from Tris's point if view.  Would not have even known who's was who's if it weren't for the their names.  Epic fail in my opinion.  Wouldn't recommend this trilogy now to anyone.  Waste of time.  Sorry Mrs. Roth, but you botched this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. I was very delighted when it was offered on Kindle Fire. I would recommend this game to everyone who loves a challenge.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Easy setup and clear video view if I have strong internet connection. One features I want is Chrome extension for Chrome browser for Android tablet. PC can do it, but tablet cant.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|So thoroughly enjoyable, Alma Whittaker is one of my new favorite characters in fiction. An epic journey and totally engaging, this book will be remembered for a long time to come.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great device at a lower cost I ever seen. I hope Google create more applications that can be streamed to chromecast
B009LDD54K|5.0|Hugely entertaining, keeps you guessing, sends you through emotional spirals, great actors and excellent reenactment of the era.  I have all 3 series and will continue to purchase the rest!!!
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I was trying to cut hair and I hit the &#34;reverse&#34; button and it undid my cuts!!! So, the buttons are in the way. Minus the things mentioned above, this app is fun and stylish!
B008J05EL8|1.0|I'm not sure what I purchased. Doesn't work. Try getting a hold of someone at Amazon for assistance. HELLO!!!  Anybody there!?
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I have enjoyed this game for a couple of years on my pc and now on my kindle. The only fault I find is the levels are so hard at times I can't get by.: I<br />.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great protection for my bluetooth and assures me that it will be charged with minimal effort whener needed.  A great product for the price.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love it! Very user friendly and wonderful for people of all ages. I love how you can connect it to your Facebook and share scores.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|Thoroughly enthralling. A must read. Informative , thought provoking , excellent story, heart wrenching at times.<br />Can't wait to start his next book
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is awesome, I think I have been playing for 3 hours; it's very addictive.  And I haven't had any issues wit glitches or corruptions.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Any new puzzles that I buy or try to make with my own photos do not come out right. They don't fit together like they should. There are gaps in between the pieces and it looks like some of the connector ends get cut off. Other than that, the app is great. Would like to see this fixed in the future. I payed for those puzzles and I would like it if they worked. Thank you.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I really appreciate honest, adult, first person writing.  This had enough humor to keep it from being a completely typical read.  Yes, it's a fantasy storyline but isn't that why we read romance novels?!  Looking forward to reading more from this author!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This couple is absolutely certifiable, but I couldn't put it down!  This is a must read, except for newly weds or anyone engaged! LOL!
1781162646|3.0|I WASN'T THRILL WITH ALL OF THE BORING SUSPENSE AND THE STRANGE VOCABULARY OF THIS BOOK BUT, IT WAS JUST A SO SO NOVEL TO READ TO PAST TIME.
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|The game is awesome but is not hd. Don't listen to people who are saying it has awesome graphics. It's not hd so you can't see the graphic detail. And what really sucks is that it is hd on my ipad and galaxy s3 but not my kindle fire hd. Because it is not hd it blurs out. Though when on the ipad it because it is hd the graphics are awesome. great game though.
B008EL25LE|3.0|Gave  it three because I don't really like chain matching. Other than that I suppose it is okay. Graphics are very good.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Great bundle. Nice features and this also includes digital download. Nice 3D conversion to one of the all-time Disney favorites. Great for cartoon lovers and Lion King fans!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Best game I've played since Myst and American Magee's Alice.  May finish it a little fast, but maybe I'm being overconfident.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|I liked it.  It's a fast read, as always, and Reacher prevented a scheme.  But some things bothered me.  Jack was fairly obnoxious at times.  That surprised me, and it was a side of him I didn't like.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Violent in parts but enjoyable adult series with excellent acting. Will order Seasons 2 and three next. I'm addicted now.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Difficult at first but when you get experienced it is a lot of fun. Riding a motorcycle on the moon is the most fun.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Like the middle bear of Goldilocks fame, Ender is a culmination of the \\"just right.\\" He's the youngest of three genetically engineered Wiggin children. The oldest, Peter Wiggin, is cold-blooded but lacks control. Valentine, the middle child and only girl, is calculating but lacks callousness. Ender is the one the human race has been waiting for. The one who will lead them to victory in the third and final battle against the hostile alien \\"Buggers.\\"<br /><br />So they hope. First, he must be vetted and trained.<br /><br />We follow him from schoolyard to space station as he engages in a series of military games against A.I. and other gifted children. Friends and enemies all do their part to complete Ender, shaping him into a person that must rely on his own wits and intellect in order to survive.<br /><br />I really think this book deserves its praise. The writing is engaging and I felt an enormous amount of sympathy toward Ender. I know there are follow-up books set in the same universe, but because I feel this one stands so strongly on its own, I'm unsure whether or not I'll read them.<br /><br />While perusing reviews, I've come across some common criticisms that I'd like to address:<br /><br />* Ender isn't interesting because he never really fails.<br /><br />This line of thought holds some truth. After the first few chapters, I never really expected him to come up short against any of the obstacles tossed his way. Sure, he feels that he's failed at some points, believing he's becoming the brother he despises.<br /><br />But I never felt bored with him. In my opinion, the lack of try-fail cycles isn't critical because the climax is a spectacular failure, one which he hopes to make up for at the end.<br /><br />* Ender doesn't act his age.<br /><br />Based on his level of intelligence, a lot of people have a hard time believing Ender is so young. I felt the same through most of the book. But afterward, I reflected on the futuristic setting coupled with genetic engineering, and decided there was enough plausibility for me to buy into it.<br /><br />I also think we have a tendency to forget just how intelligent we all were at his age. We may not have been able to express ourselves due to lack of life experience, but I can recall having \\"complex\\" thoughts that might seem unusual for a six-year-old.<br /><br />--<br /><br />If you haven't sat down with \\"Ender's Game\\", I'd say grab a copy.gineering, and decided there was enough plausibility for me to buy into it.<br /><br />I also think we have a tendency to forget just how intelligent we all were at his age.

1579655327|2.0|The book and the magazines are beautifully photographed.  The writing in both is weak, and the concept in general is way too self-congratulatory.  \\"Look how cool we are!\\"  There is a recipe for coffee, and another for cut melon, it is fairly ridiculous.

B002UBRFDC|4.0|After reading 1491 and 1493 I was interested in continuing to explore history and a colleague recommended Shogun.  I remembered my mom watching the mini-series in the early 80's and recall Richard Chamberlain as the central figure of the show and it never quite inspired me to read the book.  Greater than 30 years later, I was very pleased about the recommendation. The book is so very well researched and through its storytelling creates an excellent and subtle framework to understanding and learning about Japan's initial engagement with the West. The disciplined and unique culture is very well examined through the Samurai, the wives and the consorts and their interaction with the barbarians and the church.  Growing up Catholic we tended to ignore the inconsistencies of the Church and its flagrant misuse of the religion to exploit everyone it came in contact with during this incredible era of exploration and lost opportunity to set humanistic precedence to treat other cultures and people with respect.  Columbus Day came about as I was nearing the end of the novel and the web page ([...] really put into light how vicious people could be when wealth was the primary motivator.
B00ERIUO02|2.0|alot of hype and  not much depth.  she got  a  chance to  have  a good greatest  hits package.problem  for her  is that  alot of material  seems to contrived and  leaves very little to the imagination. not all her fault.  she is  a marginal vocalist and she rides on cliche  grooves and familar sound cuts. this time  this album is flat.  she got her own lane until she runs out of a hit.
B002T9H2LK|4.0|This movie was pretty decent and had a good story line, it was brutal in different parts of the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game that is challenging and allows you to compete with your friends. Some levels are so challenging that I am trying to beat them for weeks but others are easy enough to solve in a couple of tries.
B000002GZ1|5.0|this album is a great album, the music is tight and although it dates back a few years it is blues at it's best.

1451666179|5.0|I've been a huge fan of hyperbole and a half for years and she has always been a fantastic writer not because she is writing fictional masterpieces but because she is letting her readers in on her mind and in a lot of ways ourselves. She lets us laugh at our own craziness by talking about her craziness. I've struggled with depression most of my life and her posts about depression, which are both in this book as well, are some of the best descriptions of what depression feels like, a hard concept to explain to people who have never gone through it.<br /><br />The book itself is gorgeous and much bigger than i expected, thick glossy pages that really let the stories and art pop. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is either a fan already or a complete newcomer to allie's work.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss draws you into an incredible journey of a young man who faces more hardship than anyone at his age should and yet is one of the most brilliant students of his age. Rothfuss has a poetic way of pulling his readers into the life of Kvothe, making you feel like you are right alongside him the whole time. Beautifully written, incredibly entertaining.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love this show and the game but it needs a lot of work, such as lower costs, fewer things that require real money to buy, and more  and cheaper ways to get gems. This game is a cash cow, lower your bloody prices Hasbro!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been anxiously waiting for this kindle app.  so glad it's finally out, and it's fun to play.  no problems noticed while playing.
1449305172|5.0|I read this book after reading The Business Model Canvas (which included the canvas concept that Lean Canvas was based on), The Four Steps to the Epithany, etc. What I like about Ash's book is that it takes a lot of excellent concepts from other people such as Eric Ries, introduces his concept of a Lean Canvas, and most importantly gives you practical steps. His guide for running lean experiments and validating until you have a product that people want is both useful, and an easy read.
B000002LGA|5.0|I love so many of his songs.  The authentic voice just rings so true for me.  He had me at the first cut, Romeo had Juliette,  the lyric \\"Romeo Rodriguez squares his shoulders and curses Jesus,runs a comb through his black pony-tail\\"  is so East LA...but his is NYC.  This and other street life lines touched me as realistic as the cholos I grew up watching.  10/28/13  RIP Lou Reed.

B00ANY7V8M|5.0|I love this set, and I am 22. I still love building LEGO® sets, and this was a perfect set to keep me occupied on my 15 minute break. Easy to build, and straight up adorable. This is my first time venturing into the Friends line, and I will definitely be back, perhaps with some larger sets.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Once you start you won't be able to stop playing this game.  I like to keep up the challenge by not purchasing all of the extras. Keeps the game interesting, and makes me take a break now and then. Like figuring out the puzzles.
B000HL0EEE|4.0|I know most people panned this series I think in perspective it's a good series looking forward to the seasons I have.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Whoever created this game is evil. Very fun and addicting. Glad they finally created it for the Kindle. Thank you.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book and was sad to see it end.  This was such a great follow up to The Shining, from beginning to end i couldn't put it down.  I have read both of the books and it is almost sad to have the story end and not hear any more about the characters involved, all of which Stephen King does a phenomenal job of introducing us to and making us care for.
0743454537|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, despite the sad subject matter. The various chapters are written from different characters points of view. As a mom, I had a difficult time reading from Sara's (the mom)point of view because it was so realistic and I cannot even imagine what it is like to have a sick child. The character development is well done. The only sub-plot I didn't really think was necessary was the previous romance between the lawyer and Julia. It didn't do anything to enhance the story. A lot of reviews slam the ending as a cop-out but it didn't bother me at all. This is the first novel I've read by Jodi Picoult and I'll definately check out others.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|used it more than I thought I would. I love it. couldn't sleep without it. a great download. love the different sounds and it keeps them the way you left them.
B00A2H9X6I|5.0|This version of Carrie is well done and worth seeing. I thought Chloe might not have been right for the role because she is frankly adorable, and not at all 'homely' like Carrie is in the book; but she played the role perfectly. Julianne Moore is also excellent as Mrs. White.<br /><br />Remakes are always at a disadvantage and usually need to bring a little something different for the audience. Other than the lead actresses performance there are two things that stand out in my mind that elevates this version; one is the creative use of her powers, and two and most important, Carrie has a much better reason for losing it at the end, and not only does she not harm her friends she protects them. This makes her a much more sympathetic character than the original.<br /><br />If I had any complaint at all I'd say that Carrie's home-life should have been shown as a little more oppressive and abusive than it was. Other than that, a very entertaining remake.

B000OCXIDK|4.0|The characters were well developed and the time period was well described.It kept your interest and even though the story does not have a lot of action, it was fast moving because the characters were interesting.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Call me a sucker, but I never tire of new Susan Boyle albums! I've been playing her previous CDs during Christmas anyway because her gorgeous voice is perfect for the holiday. It's great to have another holiday-driven follow-up to &#34;The Gift&#34;.<br /><br />Highlight tracks for me are:<br /><br />-I'll Be Home for Christmas<br />-The Christmas Song<br />-Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas<br />-Hark the Herald Angels Sing<br />-The Christmas Waltz<br /><br />but really every track is great. You definitely won't want to skip any.<br /><br />The productions are also nice, very songbook and classic. A mix of modern sound, '50s cheer and traditional hymn.<br /><br />OVERALL: You can't go wrong with Boyle. Her voice is still one of the best I've heard and this album again does an excellent job of showcasing that voice. I cannot wait to put up my tree while listening to this CD!
B00A25NLOU|5.0|I thought the mix of the old and new was brilliant.  A really different type of book that would appeal to a wide range of readers. old and young.  It ticked all the boxes for me.

B00DURHYWC|5.0|This wonderful group of musicians show once again that music transcends political and geographic boarders.<br /><br />Not to be boxed into standard U.S. music industry norm's, Lauderdale use's his little big band along with the smooth voices from China and Storm to take us to sights and sounds rarely heard in the U.S..<br /><br />I'm not a fan of big band 30's-40's-50's and beyond sounds, but Lauderdale ease's me in there anyway.  This is light, delightful, get happy music brought to us by and from Pink Martini as only they can.<br /><br />Having joined a Taiko group this year, cut #7, \\"Zundoko-bushi\\" brings a smile to my face every time I hear this too short joyful song.<br /><br />Add this one to your international sound collection.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|This film is innovative, creative, original, full of action, intrigue and keeps you guessing to the end. It's as the film says \\"look very closely bc the closer you look the further you're away from what u think u know. \\" The end is a shocker and you'll want to get the DVD just so u can look back at it over and over again to find the clues. And just when u think u've seen all the clues you note later there r still other clues that u missed. A really fantastic and enjoyable experience to see this film.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This little guy does it's job charging anything fast, even charged my friend's Note 2 quickly.  Don't spend $20-$30 on car chargers, pick this baby up and use the cable that came with your phone and this will charge your phone quickly.  If you have 30-45 minute commute you will get a substantial charge in a short time.  It has a slot for Apple devices and a slot for Android.  The slots mean each one is optimized for each but you can charge them in either port, they just charge faster if you match devices to the ports.  This made sense before when I had an Android phone and my GF has an iPhone, but now that I have an iPhone as well, one of these with two apple slots would be cool.

B001TH16DI|4.0|This was purchased as a 'trip down memory lane', as I had seen most of the pix before, when they first came out. I admit, I probably wouldn't have bought it if it had not been on special - great price for the entire set. If you're a Trekkie, I recommend adding this to your collection if you don't have them all already. If you've never 'gone where no one has gone before', this may be your passport to adventure.

B00DQQSD2W|5.0|I bought the coffee table book a few years back and loved it.  Just today, I heard about the Enhanced Version with audio interviews and embedded videos for the Kindle.  This was just icing on the cake and just HOW you're supposed to do a Kindle edition.<br /><br />The book itself is great.  You learn everything from concept waaaay back in 1968, all the way to its release on May, 1977 and just about every step in-between.  The best part is, these notes and interviews were of people people working on it at the time, not some retrospective recollection where they can choose to selectively omit and/or change how they envision Star Wars now (cough, George Lucas, cough)<br /><br />Learn the original vision and revision as this iconic movie evolved into the cult phenomenon it is today.

0385351399|4.0|This novel was reviewed and recommended in several magazines, and so I decided to give it a try. It was an interesting read, and definitely gave food for thought. The question of privacy as well as how the ease of technology can rob society of privacy is addressed throughout the novel. Another concept that is explored is how politically correct society has become. In the novel, that correctness causes people to stop looking closely at what is happening around them. The book is both a warning and a prediction of what could happen to society if society does not play an active part in what is happening in the world. The characters are frustrating because the main character, Mae, seems to miss the obvious happening right under her nose. The fact that she is young does give some credence to her acceptance, but not to her complete ignorance of the damage her beliefs cause for her ex-boyfriend and her parents. Despite its faults, this is a novel worth reading for the questions it raises. They are questions that everyone needs to contemplate, especially in the technological age of today.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was very good and so inspiring. It really is interesting to find out how she got through everything she went through
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Fun that starts simple and grows as you go. Has the same allure as Legos with the added fun of watching it actually blast off.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|Fans of Motorhead, Lemmy in particular, have been concerned about his health lately, and for good reason given his fast and loose life style, but at least musically, he's not just alive and well - the whole band is still mopping up the floor with young pups almost 50 years younger.<br />  When I buy a new Motorhead album, it's a great comfort zone because I know exactly what I'll get every time:  the hardest rock and roll on the planet and probably a few solar systems around us if they can get a signal.  Lemmy, Phil Campbell and Mickey Dee are as classic a line up as the &#34;Ace of Spades&#34; team, and guitarist Phil Campbell has put by far the most time in as Motorhead's axe slinger, stepping in on &#34;Orgasmatron&#34; back in the early '80's and a bonafide rock and roll guitar hero in his own right.<br />  &#34;Aftershock&#34; continues in the vein of the last several albums, as well it should be.  Lemmy's bass sound is more pronounced, and sounds much better lately, and the production is tighter than hell.  For a band that reveled in its gloriously sloppy approach in the Fast Eddie daze, they have become over time a precision outfit that knocks you over with more energy than any band around.  There isn't one standout track - it's 14 songs of slamming metallic rock and roll.  Motorhead are truly legends, and they damn well better get inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when they're eligible or I'll consider the whole thing a pathetic farce.  Long live Lemmy and Motorhead.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this movie.  Very well done and quite entertaining.  Will probably watch this again in a year or two.
140015328X|5.0|I've been interested in the history of the personal computer since I first watched \\"Triumph of the Nerds\\" back in the 90's.  This book really does a great job of filling in some of the blanks about how things happened from an engineer's perspective.  For its conversational tone and in depth coverage of the development of the PC, I have to give this book 5 stars.<br /><br />I've read a lot of the reviews here and would like to comment on a repeated criticism I see, that Woz is bragging?  A man who arguably created the home computer writes the story of how he did it.  How is it not going to sound like bragging to some?  Woz explains how he was a nerd interested in engineering, and all the steps of self discovery that he took which positioned him (perhaps uniquely) to be able to know how to put together a working home PC when the parts became available.  The book goes into great detail of those parts - if anything is amiss in the book, it's the lack of coverage of other people.  But if you consider how shy Woz is in real life, is it any surprise that he doesn't feel comfortable talking about other folks in detail?  I think not.<br /><br />In short, this is probably as close as most of us will come to sitting down with him and having a conversation.  I wish it was a longer book, and that he had more detail after the early Apple stuff - but it is a great piece of history from a unique perspective.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|I watched this with my 11 year old son.  Had to introduce him to the finer things in life.  He laughed at a lot, didn't get a little, and liked the music - which is great in this movie.  If you haven't seen it, where have you been?  Pass it on to your kids.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|The music is really good! Band and choir nerds will love it and be able to relive high school. Rebel Wilson is really funny.

1401308201|4.0|A lavish look behind the scenes of a great show!<br /><br />This book pulls the curtain back on the making of the Broadway musical \\"Wicked\\", and is based largely on interviews with the show's creators, including Stephen Schwartz (music and lyrics) and Winnie Holzman (book), as well producers, director, costume designer, set designer, make up designer, and several of the actors from the original Broadway run, including Kristin Chenoweth (Glinda) and Idina Menzel (Elphaba).<br /><br />The book contains chapters on the origins of the show, as well as the process by which the music, costumes, make up, and set design were developed for the show. This includes the story of how Stephen Schwartz convinced Gregory Macuire (the author of the book upon which the show is based) and Universal Pictures (who had licensed the book for film) to produce a musical version of the story, and how he enlisted later Winnie Holzman and the other creatives involved in developing the show.<br /><br />The book also includes a section that tells the story of the show, including all the lyrics from all of the show's songs.<br /><br />As a fan of musicals in general and a student of the creative process, this book was a a very welcome addition to my library.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who is fan of the show or musicals in general, but it's also a great examination of the creative process involved in taking a property from one medium and adapting it to another medium.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I'm not a fan of vampire movies, but this movie is beyond a vampire movie.  Difficult to explain, but the story is so different from the worn out genre that I have added both video versions to my video library ('Let Me In' and 'Let the Right One In').  The story, acting, direction and screen-play are superb.  Very captivating and haunting.  Not easily forgotten.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|Do not buy this set under any circumstance.  There is no excuse for the quality of this set.  It has to be pirated homade tapes copied to disc. The main problem being the picture.  It is so blurry and pixelated that you cannot even see details like somebodies eyes in some scenes.  The picture looks like it was recorded with a video cam aimed at an old tv with a vacuum cleaner running to add static.  The packaging is cheap and low quality also, just cheap, thin, brittle trays that are stacked and then taped on one edge. Unfortunately I bought this 7 months ago and just got around to watching them, so I can't return it.  In the meantime I have gotten amazon prime and have watched a couple of episodes on there.  On prime the pictures are flawless just like they should be, like they were when they aired originally.  Not all blurry and pixilated like on this dvd set.  I am really kicking myself for not watching these when I bought them.  I really would like a refund on this trash.

B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Not a rocket scientist or an astronaut?<br /><br />Not to worry--there is training in Designing, building, flying, orbiting and Advanced orbiting. You can optionally perform various activities against other players from around the world to see how you do. You start by building your ship. The tutorial is very clear. And, as it says, \\"Use your imagination and build crazy rocket ships. The bigger they are, the harder they are to control, but half the fun is watching them fly apart and explode.\\"<br /><br />As you proceed through the training, a green dot shows you which ones you've looked at. Once you feel you're trained enough, you can try the challenges. You'll be given a goal you have to achieve. There is also a smaller version of our solar system so you can test your rockets launching from different planets.<br /><br />This is really very well done and the graphics are quite good.  Unique, at least to me, and something that one can endlessly explore by building different ships.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this 2013 movie...<br /><br />The Conjuring (2013) is a ghost story/demonic possession horror movie that is fairly effective at producing some scares.  Although I kept saying to myself, \\"I've seen this sort of thing before\\", it was a bit better than most of the trashy horror movies that have come out in the past 15-20 years.  It was good to see Lili Taylor in this movie.  I remember her from the remake of The Haunting (1999).  That was a terrible movie (I gave it 1 star), but Lili Taylor did a decent job in that movie and her performance in The Conjuring is no exception.  The Conjuring has a pretty good scary atmosphere and some creepy looking props (I don't want to give anything away).<br /><br />If you want to see a decent horror flick that came out in 2013, then I pretty much recommend The Conjuring.  At least it isn't a remake of something (as far as I know).

The only complaint is the male dancer scene.  There was no need for that.  This scene was not funny and not germane to the plot at all.  Why does Hollywood feel obligated to add these types of scenes to otherwise well-plotted movies?
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It's a good but not great application that is pretty good I would say. And it's kind of good buy the way
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was great with plenty of plot twists. In reading this, although, you may find some similar parts. All in all, this book was fantastic with plenty of action, drama, and comedy. I fell in love with all of the characters(especially Jace *wink*) and I love the authors imagination.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Sanderson brings his wonderful talent for character and magic systems with this young adult story that's a page-turning adventure.  The pacing of this book is so fast, you're  almost done reading it before you realize you started.  For those who enjoy his epic fantasies, this is a great (even more streamlined) adaptation that answers the question:  &#34;What if people suddenly woke up with super powers?&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have enjoyed having this game on my kindle. I wish you could have more than 5 lives at a time.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|Had higher expectations however was still a good movie, was nice to see something that is not a sequel or remake of an older movie or TV series.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Not spending money, very cute game.  Want the chance to earn gems with my dedication to the boring ball/ star/ Apple games though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally, candy crush is available on kindle fire :)  if you don't already play this game, prepare to be addicted.
B00FQPHOPI|5.0|I have seen every superman movie made and this is the best superman movie ever made. Rent it, watch it, love it.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|After reading the first book, picking up the rest of the trilogy was a no-brainer.  However, Allegiant leaves the first two behind for, as our heroes gain more knowledge of their true situation, their choices get deeper quickly. Unexpected changes in personnel leave some heartbreak in their wake, and imagine my surprise when one of the hearts affected was mine... Brilliant conclusion to the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting. It can also be very frustrating at times and it seems like you can't get anywhere without spending money. But, if you keep at it, you can beat the levels without spending anything.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Very entertaining and an excellent transfer. The 3 D was fantastic on this. This was one of the best zombie movies to come out in a long time...
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Not the best ending, pretty heavy handed, but it does wrap up the story.<br /><br />Spoiler:<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />Would have preferred a happy ending, I feel cheated hanging on for so long to read these terribly written books for that ending where the girl doesn't get her guy...
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|J.J. Abrams did a wonderful job on the follow up of his first Star Trek movie. Highly reccomend picking this one up for the behind the scene footage that shows deleted scenes and how they made the fight scenes look so great.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I never started watching the show but with Amazon prime I was able to watch when I could. I really like the show. You quickly identify with certain characters and loathe others. But the singing is AMAZING!!!!
B00CHVJODE|5.0|I thought it was wonderful,  I can't imagine the cave, no sunshine, running out of food, fighting over food every day, everything barren.  The father was so very protective of all the family.  Wish they were like that today.  They finally came out of the cave age by the help of &#34;Guy&#34;<br /><br />I just loved it!!!!<br /><br />Ruby V.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I got this because I like nature sounds go relax. so because you can mix your own sounds I found some my 4year old likes. we listen every night to help us sleep and sometimes to relax during the day. they also have theta sound for migranes and relaxation
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Just love this series, the digital transfer on this is excellent good price and great value can't wait till the next season
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Even though I have most everything the Top has done, I like this set very much. It has all of the discs that I am really interested in.<br />With all their major hits and great blues guitar music dating to their first album, as well as their 'synthetic' adventures on the newer material here. The thing about this box set, is they re-mastered it correctly. They kept the original sound and feel. A lot of the re-mixes nowadays are just that. They lay in riffs from studio sessions that they recorded in the present instead of leaving the 'original' music and improving the quality. I, personally cannot stand that. Especially on the songs that we were raised with. I want to hear the song as it was, not as they think it should sound now. There have been some great songs by artists ruined because of this. This set keeps that in mind. They improve the sound quality and make those hits sound excellent. Good job !
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|was so pleasantly surprised as usually not an autobiography reader, this story was awesome, author writes like someone would speak and you get a feel for her triumphs and defeats throughout the journey, fabulous book.
1449305172|5.0|For those looking to get started with the Lean approach to customer and product development, this book serves as a practical, step by step guide to getting started. This is very helpful if you embrace the concepts but just need practical advice for getting started. It also provide artifacts that will be useful in communicating your progress to stakeholders in your ventures. I use this book daily for projects which are in various stages of maturity. I'd encourage you to as well!
B009ME47H2|2.0|The volume on this app just isn't good enough to record anything unless you're screaming into the device.  The one time I really needed to record something it came out as a whisper.  Very disappointing.
B00170GXQ2|4.0|like the story line about long lasting love and Gods forgiveness with a little bit of comedy in this dramatic film
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|Not the best of the 3 but was still entertaining, worth a rent but not a purchase... The 3D was excellent
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Missile Defender is very addicting and challenging.  The app was free when I downloaded it.  I would definitely recommend this app.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|having no idea what to expect with this book as it was chose in my bookclub. Wow it was just so wonderful, so pleasantly surprised as such a great read.  magical with great twist throughout.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I loved it. I just fell in love with the book when I read the first two chapters I can't wait to read the second one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this title almost more than the others in the series! I would start with the first one though before reading the others just to get the background on the lead characters going in!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I'm a fan of point and click puzzle games but I genuinely enjoyed playing this game. Time for an update though! Ready for more!!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|After reading the first two books I was excited about this one.  It started out real slow got better and then the end just made me mad. I had a hard time telling if it was Tris or Tobias telling the story had to keep going back to the beginning of the chapter to see who was speaking.  All in all I was disappointed... I really wanted to like it as much as the first two.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|MoboPlayer is the best video player for free out there.  MoboPlayer can play all types of formats.  I would definitely recommend this player.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The first time I played this game on my kindle fire HD I loved it. But now I think the other 2 versions are better (mainly because the pocket edition is still in alpha).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Such fun...once you start playing this game you don't want to stop.  It really is hard to put down.  Buy it, what do you have to lose?
B009U9S6FI|5.0|If a man can do so much good after enduring so much pain, we all should never hesitate in giving to those who have less.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I really like this book I make and sell brackets but I decided I wanted to learn a different way to make them and I LOVE THIS book:)
B008OOYALE|3.0|...but I figure all games are at least a 3-star game.  It looks more like something my kids would play.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|Greedy Spiders 2 is a great simple game that most ly geared towards kids.  I would definitely recommend this game.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|this book started a little slow for me.  I thought it was only one husband's secret but surprise, not the case.
006202406X|3.0|I had such high hopes for this series. I even chose to overlook the obvious similarities to &#34;The Hunger Games Trilogy&#34;. I recommended it to my son, to his friends, and to my friends. But honestly, after I finished this book, all I could think was, &#34;I really want my time and money back for THAT one.&#34; The series and the movie franchise had such potential. Did I want the fairytale ending? Pretty much. In all fairness, it's a decent read until she turns Four into a whiny brat and kills off the main character. But hey, think of it as &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; meets &#34;Old Yeller&#34;.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great time. Glad it was finally available on kindle and for free.<br />No lagging or freezing.  Beautiful graphics.  I feel like I should be able to eat the candy off the screen
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I love this game finished first one number 2 is awesome loads of fun and challenging recommend it to the young and old.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is addictive.  Family loves it.  Great way to spend time together as a family.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a new challenge!
B004X80QNG|4.0|Pocket Informant is a great organizer.  This has a simple way to organize contacts.  I would definitely recommend this application.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|John Mayer is always evolving and this CD has a country, bluegrass sound at times.  It is often cheerful in a laid back way. I love Wildfire especially.  I saw him in concert this summer so the songs were already familiar and those of you who have seen him in concert know what he brings to a song live.  If you are looking for another Continuum, I don't expect another one in his career, but you never know.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Ok, so I swore I wouldn't be a crush addict... but it happened! I love this game. My kids, and husband hate it cause this is where my time goes.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This is one of my favorite philosophically leaning movies of all time. It is always a treat to watch, and this DVD version is perfect for any person's collection.
B009V0TV6O|3.0|Even after app removal and re installation, the app shows free version. Seems like a great app for a musician but unclear about the product license. Is it supposed to be called free but you get the pro, or I'm sick with free. I just don't know. So three stars for now.
006202406X|1.0|I cannot understate how excited I was for Allegiant.  I was concerned after starting it that i found it easier to put down than the first two (which kept me up all night).  I think this stemmed in part from my inability to distinguish the dual voices- I kept looking back to the first page of the chapter to see who's mind I was hearing.  In the end, this book did keep me up all night.  Because I was shocked, disappointed, and crushed.  My job in real life shows me the grief and suffering of others far too much.  The last thing I want from my chosen entertainment is more of the same without some redeeming feature.  This book didn't have it.  I cannot read Roth again, and I don't even think I can see the movie despite my affection for Divergent.  The whole story was ruined for me in the same ways others describe, and I wish I'd never read it.
B00DJUPLY8|3.0|GoodPlayer for Android is good but there is better out there.  I would recommend this player but there are more robust players out there
B000WEMH3C|4.0|It fits over my non-Weber grill and it does the job. It's inexpensive and protects my charcoal grill from the elements.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Absolutely beautiful movie! Johnny Depp never disappoints and the effects were really well done! I completely recommend this movie to anyone!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I use these with my ath-m50s and it easily bumps up my sound and makes the sound more greater, if you're a bass head but also like clarity in your music and you're using the ath-m50s, try using the gain at max treble at 4 and bass at 10, keep the volume between 0 and 33 and you're set.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|This game is just awesome with great physics and game play. It's fun to make smart designs and get the goals or just try and get it to blow up. :-P
B008TRUDAS|5.0|A must read. A heart wrenching story that will bring tears to your eyes....more than once. I couldn't put it down. Love Colleen Hoover.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I don't own many movies but this one is &#34;most exceptional&#34;.  Charming, sweet, meaningful and hardly needs stating, beautifully acted.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|A fun game to play. The only thing negative that  I have say is that it can be a little tedious, but it's still a great way to pass the time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. It is very fun for all ages I think everybody should have it. This is all I play!!!!
B004742Y68|5.0|wanted something that was age appropriate for my 15 year old daughter and this was it.  It has a lot of scary sites but no real gore or inappropriate behavior.  Just clean had from
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|Everyone that had played angry birds will find this game easy to play. However you don't stay static at a single place and aim. You have to maneuver through obstructions(skeletons, lights, bats and your stupidity :-P ) to get that sweet princess blood. And this held me playing with it for a good deal of time. Also the graphics and animations are good and worth playing for. Simple enough for anyone to play.<br /><br />However the controls are a bit clumsy and you tend to forget and get messed up with movement and shooting.<br /><br />Other than that, cute game to play for fun as everyone wants to get to the beautiful girl on the other side. :-D
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Received it as soon as it was released since I preordered. It's my favorite TV series. We watch it over and over so that is why I purchase each season.
B000GWE44U|4.0|Enjoyed watching it for the first time.  Classic!  Yet does not feel dated.  A bit too long.<br />Redrum. Redrum. Redrum.
1480513164|5.0|I've read or listened  to 26 of Dean Koontz books, plus all of the Odd Thomas series.  Watchers is his best work before Odd came along.  It has a lot of similarities to the Odd books.  My wife just finished Watchers and she agrees -- it is the best in Non-Odd-Koontz category.<br /><br />BTW -- If you seen any of the 3 failed attempts to make a movie of this, try and forget them.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|I absolutely loved Tipping Point, blink & Outliers.  I guess it's hard to equal those.  His last book, What the dog saw, was more of a compilation of short works and I didn't really like it.  Felt like he was riding on the fame of the first 3 books.<br /><br />So, I had hoped this latest book would be more like the earlier works.  It does have some similar feel to it, especially in the first half of the book, some striking thoughts about adversity.  But the second half went off the rails and lost me, rambling on and on.<br /><br />Worth a read if you are a fan of Gladwell, otherwise hope for some greater inspiration for the next book.
B00BT1XCOU|4.0|hahaha just kidding! It's a great program. My wife and I enjoyed it so much. Can't wait for the last season (nine).
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Just what I was looking for....Just one great app good for my tablet and phone cant say enough good about it
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great work out for those looking to tone up. Please do not expect instant results. Stay with the program. This is lighter exercise than P90X or Insanity, I can see results but I haven't achieved my goal yet. I have been using this for 1 month on and off and am currently on level 2. But it is by far the easiest thing to fit into my schedule. only 20 minutes a day, who can beat that! It gives me energy and helps me tone up.
1449305172|5.0|Running Lean is a terrific book for entrepreneurs and others who want to expand their business thinking. I have recommended it to a number of people. In fact, I purchased the book when it first came out and have since also purchased the Kindle version for quick reference. I highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a fun and addicting game! Hours will pass by with out me even realizing it! Always something else to work on
1476747016|3.0|You can't help but smile at drawings of fat cats gorging themselves on food and being lazy. This would make a great gift for a young child, as the pictures are colorful and the language is basic, but I don't think anyone over the age of 6 would be able to justify paying $15 bucks for a 5-minute distraction, especially when you can see many of the same images on Pusheen's blog. Use it to teach your kid how to read, or maybe buy it as a gift for someone who likes to collect things with cats on them. You'll get about what you can expect.<br /><br />*I was given a free copy by Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.*
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like the hunger games because it was interesting when the mutts came out and attacked with the other guy ahead o them
0142410705|5.0|It's a John Green book, what can more can you say.<br />It's got a child prodigy, a road trip, and lots of Katherines, you can't go wrong.<br />DFTBA
B002VBV1S6|5.0|The best books are the hardest to review, because it’s difficult to be objective when all you want to do is rave about how awesome the book was, how captivating and engaging the plot was, how smooth the pacing, how amazing was the whole package and how you didn’t want to put it down when the story was finished.<br /><br />This is one of those books.<br /><br />The story, naturally, centres around Locke Lamora, orphan and thief with a flair for the dramatic. No score is too big for him, no scheme too complex. If it involves disguising himself as a rich merchant in order to con nobles out of their money, well, all the better! Locke’s sense daring nature is one of the things that makes this book so incredible; you can’t help but admire the guy. He’s the quintessential lovable rogue, the charismatic thief whose clandestine dealings are nothing but thrills and adventure. Even when he’s robbing people blind and scaring them into silence, you can’t help but root for him.<br /><br />The familiar European influence in the setting works well here, and the it let me put my focus on the fast and tight plot that was unfolding. Lynch does some wonderful world-building, layering piece upon piece until not only do you have an interesting culture in Camorr, but also a believable one. It’s a city of hidden corruption, hands stabbing as often as shaking, the unwary losing their fortunes or their lives just as easily as they once kept both. But it’s not a crapsack world where everything is dark and horrible; there’s light and hope and fun and all the positive and negative things that make up the life of a busy city of commerce and culture.<br /><br />The way the story is told takes a little getting used to, with each chapter followed by an interlude that sometimes tells some of Locke’s childhood and training, sometimes the training of another of Locke’s friends, sometimes little stories and explanations of things in Camorri culture. This sort of storytelling doesn't always work, but Lynch pulls it off, allowing the reader to get a proper feel for everything without sitting through inappropriate infodumps, and it allows the whole story to be revealed piece by interlocking piece.<br /><br />Trust me, if you haven’t taken the time to read this book, you need to correct that. From beginning to end, it was a fast-paced and amazing adventure, one that’s worth every second you spend on it. It’s not a perfect book, but it’s one of the closest to perfect that I’ve ever read.sn't always work, but Lynch pulls it off, allowing the reader to get a proper feel for everything without sitting through inappropriate infodumps, and it allows the whole story to be revealed piece by interlocking piece.<br /><br />Trust me, if you haven’t taken the time to read this book, you need to correct that.

B006YTTVHO|2.0|Nothing really learned hear, mostly common sense bits. Not sure why I downloaded, but I didn't find anything I could take from it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Colorful, puzzling, addictive, and oh Apollo sweet!!!  Even the cat tries to chase the candies when you hook the kindle up to the big screen. How cool is that?
B00D3PYQT0|4.0|Very nicely boxed DVD set for this excellent British series.<br />However, the downside is PBS Advertsement segments in your face.. Paid content should not include product advertising, infinte traileers are bad enough. In this case, when you launch the DVD you have to view long commercials for luxury products upfront. Really not aceptable. Otherwise, great sound and image.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love this game. It is one of my favorite matching games. When will part 2 be out? I also would like to see a compatible kindle fire hdx game for 7 wonders of the world magical mystery tour.
1469235943|5.0|This book kept my attention from the minute I picked it up until the very end. I hated to see it end.
0060853972|5.0|I am a huge Terry Pratchett fan and I really enjoy Neil Gaiman as well.  This book actually has me laughing out loud at regular intervals!
006202406X|3.0|I felt like I waited FOREVER for this book to finally come out!  I loved this series from page one of Divergent to the last page of Insurgent.  Then I had to wait again for Allegiant to come out.  I pre-ordered it months in advance and checked my mail box a hundred times the minute Amazon said it had shipped.  I avoided all reviews because I wanted to go into the last book with pure thoughts and my own ideas of what was about to happen to Tris and Tobias(Four).  After reading Allegiant, I would have to say I am a little disappointed in the writing of the book and even the way it ended but I will NOT give spoilers!! Sigh....<br /><br />Allegiant begins where Insurgent left off, with Tris and her friends locked up for participating in the uprising.  Tobias is Evelyn's right-hand man and also her son.  Evelyn is the new leader and is trying to bring everyone back under her control and rid the city of factions through brute force and any other means necessary.  While Tobias doesn't agree with what his mother is doing, he continues to follow her orders until he can find a way out.  Caleb, Tris's brother is also locked up and is awaiting his trial for helping Janine create and administer the mind warping drugs given to Dauntless to kill Abnegation people.<br /><br />\\"He is a part of me, always will be, and I am a part of him, too. I don't belong to Abnegation, or Dauntless, or even the Divergent. I don't belong to the Bureau or the experiment or the fringe. I belong to the people I love, and they belong to me- they, and the love and loyalty I give them, form my identity far more than any word or group ever could. I love my brother. I love him, and he is quaking with terror at the though of death. I love him and all I can think, all I can hear in my mind, are the words I said to him a few days ago : I would never deliver you to your own execution \\"<br /><br />\\"To me, when someone wrongs you, you both share the burden of that wrongdoing - the pain of it weighs on both of you. Forgiveness, then, means choosing to bear the full weight all by yourself. Caleb's betrayal is something we both carry, and since he did it, all I've wanted is for him to take its weight away from me. I am not sure that I'm capable of shouldering it all myself - not sure that I am strong enough, or good enough.\\"<br /><br />Tobias, Tris, Cara, Christina, Uriah, Peter, and a few others decide to leave and head to the fringe to find out what is out there.  What they find is the Bureau.  They find out that the Bureau has been monitoring them for generations and is doing scientific experiments to create the \\"perfect\\" human, not only in Chicago but across the country.  While at the Bureau, Tris and her group of misfits find out a lot of background history on their city and the many secrets kept from them and the others.  Tris finds out where her mother came from and that she was not born in the city but was actually placed in Dauntless by the Bureau as a spy.<br /><br />\\"I take a deep breath. I'm not sure where that swell of desperation came from, but know that I've acknowledge it, it's impossible to ignore, like a living thing has awakened from a long sleep inside me. It writhes in my stomach and throat. I need to leave. I need the truth.\\"<br /><br />\\"Knowledge is power. Power to do evil...or power to do good. Power itself is not evil. So knowledge itself is not evil.\\"<br /><br />Tris and Tobias have a hard time figuring out their own identity and where they belong as the secrets are unveiled.  Rifts and bad decisions begin to pull them apart instead of strengthening their bond.  Will the answers they are seeking bring them back together or will their bond break with more death and destruction than they can handle?<br /><br />\\"Since I was young, I have always known<br />this: Life damages us, every one. We<br />can't escape that damage.<br />But now, I am also learning this: We<br />can be mended. We mend each other.\\"<br /><br />\\"I don't belong to Abnegation, or Dauntless, or even the Divergent.

B007FH22VQ|5.0|Despite some wishing for a faster, more technical Meshuggah, this album delivers on every level for me. What I love about it is that it has a feel along the lines of &#34;Nothing&#34;, yet just grooves in a way that gives you another option in the repertoire of this absolutely sick band from the cold north. Let the beautiful, destructive waves of viking metal wash over you. Koloss is brutally mesmerizing.
B009MYARIK|5.0|This was a great quick read in a slightly different style from her other books but I loved it all the same. I enjoyed that she changed the narration from chapter to chapter; great way to illustrate the different story lines as they crossed each other.

It is super easy to setup, &#34;even a caveman could do it!&#34;  We love the ability to use any of our devices as a remote for chromecast.  Youtube and netflix work brilliantly.  Making a TV playlist for youtube is a breeze.<br /><br />The only reason I knocked one star off was the lack of apps so far.  We need Amazon Prime Instant Video!  How about a photo viewing app, a photoshop app for editing photos etc.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Google and hook us up with some more apps!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was extremely excited for this book to come out since I thoroughly enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent. I anticipated finding out exactly where the author was going with the story.  Wow.  Am I ever shocked, confused, and a little disappointed.<br /><br />First of all, this book is COMPLETELY different from the other 2.  Not only is this book told from different points of view (Tris AND Tobias), but there is a completely different feel to this book in general.  The flow and style are different from the first 2 and it almost feels like you're reading a totally different series.<br /><br />I DID, however, enjoy the character development for the most part.  We see several characters growing up and maturing, while others not so much.  I was a little disappointed with Tobias' character development in this book. It just didn't feel like him. Again, it almost felt as if I was reading a totally different series.<br /><br />Now on to the biggest issue with the book in my opinion:  the ending.  I won't give any spoilers, but let me just say right now that I was SO INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE WAY THIS BOOK ENDS!!!  So much so that I probably won't be reading the series again.  I was so frustrated w/ the turn the book took but I thought that maybe there could be a little silver lining at the end..... Nope.  Nothing.  I'm still not sure why the author decided to take this particular route.  There were so many other alternatives that didn't even come close to being as devastating as this one.<br /><br />Short of writing another book for this series (that would somehow undo the damage) , in my opinion, this series can't be saved.  And, unfortunately, MANY fans are saying the same thing about this book.  Even without the excruciating end, there were still issues with this book that would have been disappointing.  At first I didn't understand why other reviewers were saying that they were getting rid of the first 2 books in the series and that they would NEVER watch the movies.  Now I know.<br /><br />Be prepared to be emotionally steamrolled after reading this.  And, if you want to preserve the awesomeness of the first 2 books, then reconsider reading this one.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As always, Stephen King has delivered a wonderful, engrossing read.  I buy every book he writes.  He is the master of his generation.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I am only giving the Chromecast 3 stars because of its price. The limited applications and the glitches of the device are displeasing. Although, it did setup very quickly. The device sometimes restarts by itself when I am watching tv. Price is great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this game. fun and hard to put down. I recommend this game to everyone.<br />Hope you enjoy.
B000LPI68W|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time when I was 19.  19 years later I watched it again and it is now my favourite movie of all time.  Excellent all the way around.  Excellent writing.  Excellent directing.  Excellent cinematography, soundtrack...  And the acting is sublime.  If this film is not considered a classic, it will be.
1451626096|5.0|Well written.  Great characterization.  I could not put it down and it made me cry.<br />I think the princess was so tolerant, considering her life was never really her own.
055338595X|5.0|The best part of this book is the characters. Each one is developed in such depth that you can't help but to cheer for any character with featured chapters. Unfortunately I felt this book strongly focused on tyrion too much. As much as I love that character I was dissapointed there wasn't more of my other favorite characters, such as arya. Overall though, this book keeps the high standards that the fans have grown accustomed to of George R.R. Martin's work.
006202406X|3.0|This review is SPOILER FREE. I promise!<br /><br />Let's just jump right in, shall we? You have all heard about the ending and everyone's reactions to it at this point, right? Okay, I hated the ending. It was terribly sad and in all honesty, I don't quite understand why it was done. Maybe because it was unique compared to other dystopias? I'm not sure but I didn't like it! I cried for hours and am now in a terrible book hangover.<br /><br />I didn't give this book 2.5-3 stars because of the ending, though. I just want to clear that up right now. Yes, I don't agree with it but it still had me bawling and I appreciate Roth's ability to affect me that way. The real reason I gave it 2.5-3 stars is just the overall concept and execution of the book. For one, and I'm sad to admit this, but aside from the ending, ALLEGIANT was kind of boring. What should have been an extremely climactic book with our lot of characters venturing over the fence, wasn't. They just sort of went. I didn't feel the intensity and suspense like I felt in the other two books.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't particularly like was the explanation for why Chicago was the way it was. That, too, wasn't a huge, world crushing revelation like I thought it was going to be. It was also really confusing to follow along. I was sitting there trying to figure out what all it meant and why it even really mattered in the first place.<br /><br />My biggest thing with this book is the switching point of views. I know everyone loved Tobias and wanted to hear his side of things, I get that. However, his and Tris' voice and personality were just too alike in this book. If I didn't pay close attention when I started a new chapter, I automatically thought I was reading Tris' POV like the other two books. Only upon seeing Tris mentioned did I realize, whoops, this is Tobias' chapter. They just didn't have big enough differences in thought processes to make the switching POV work in my opinion. If there was more of a contrast then I think I would have enjoyed the refreshing change of scenery so to speak.<br /><br />I love the Divergent series and unfortunately, ALLEGIANT fell flat for me executionally. I do think fans of the first two books need to read this. You should find out how it ends. It'll probably devastate you, even if it doesn't make a whole lot of sense!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this game u have to get it if you have watched the movie u will like it even if u haven't watched the movie u will love it just get the app<br />_

B000OMFS8I|2.0|I ordered this as a gift about a week before the recipient's birthday.  Although it was shipped the next day, there was no tracking info available and it didn't arrive for a few weeks.  To add to my disappointment, the recipient said that it didn't work--no sprouts!
1449305172|5.0|I first started getting into lean startup after reading eric ries lean startup. At the end of reading that book I was enthused but didn't understand where to start.<br /><br />There is where Ash's book came in. It gave me practical steps to implement straight from day one and was the bible for sticking to the plan between myself and other startup founders.<br />If your a existing entrepreneur, wannabe entrepreneur or just want a better way to tackle a project in a more innovative way. READ THIS BOOK!. It will change the way you approach ever new product development.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Sheath on first knife had such hard closing snap that it broke when I tried to unsnap it. With the second knife I scraped off enough paint from the male snap part that it would function properly without failing. Knife is great!!!  It will replace a machete and ax that I have in my truck.
030758836X|4.0|This was suggested as a Book Club read....took a few<br />chapters to get into it but then it really took off.  Quite<br />a twist at the end.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Each episode has some drama to be resolved. Characters are reasonably well developed. Each episode I watch, I get a bit concerned that the next one will be less interesting, but the writers manage to keep bringing new elements to the show.
1781162646|5.0|He's the master. Of anything he writes. You are right there. This book was just what it was advertised as - camp, funny, scary, easy to read, easy to identify with the characters. If you have grown up in the same era as King, you see more references that grab you right back to childhood. Loved it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|At first I didn't think I would like this game but I was sucked in almost immediately! I absolutely loved this puzzling,challenging game.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Somehow I always get new laughs put of this show.  My stepdaughter is dressing up and going to the performance shows like I did long ago.  This movie will be around forever.
1476727651|5.0|I have  read every Stephen King book ever written, and this one is truly a &#34;Great Read&#34;. I can barely wait for his next book.

B005ELZNH0|5.0|wonderful collection, one can not have too many Miles albums.<br />Compact Box format is great as  shelf space saver.<br /><br />Serious collectors might consider complete Miles on Columbia, albeit at much higher cost per CD.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Little Danny is, understandably a tortured soul. As usual, descriptive, suspenseful, done so well, I didn't want to put it down.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Every Time I start to get bored with this game they add something new and fun to keep it interesting. The tutorial mode is actually the characters from the movie briefing you on what the park needs. And I like that the dinosaurs actually get larger as you continue to feed them.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|One of the problems with the Kindle OS is the limited functionality. This gives you a surprisingly robust file manager with a clean and easy to use interface. It would be a deal at $25.
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|I love it. It is an super awesome album I recommend it to all of your friends. Go Katy Perry.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!! my mother and I play it all the time. it reminds me of canyon land when you move from one level to the next
B000UH8BTK|5.0|Original album collection is a great way to replace all your scratched CDs bought in jewel boxes with liners.<br /><br />For this price, you can't go wrong.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Anyone who wants to access his Facebook account with a Kindle needs this.  It's a free app, and useful  (It beats trying to use a cell phone to access Facebook when away from my computer.)
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|What a moving tribute to life, art, and humanity...just as they are, as we all are. I can't imagine what a great time Dustin Hoffman must have had with his cast, All of THEM.<br />Left me in tears...of happiness, for obvious and private reasons. If you love Music and Mankind, don't miss this Movie.
B00AQMQBKK|3.0|I have never played the physical version of this game. If it's anything like app, then it's pretty BORING. It's a pretty ruthless dice-game, but there's not a lot of options, and you'll lose a lot of times. The art is nice, but the interface is... annoying at times. I'd pass if I were you.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked this book. While I was able to put things together before they were revealed, I did find some surprises. Loved the epilogue.
0066620996|5.0|So much you can learn here and apply to your business and your life. Great quotes are located inside for sure.
B003IY49S4|5.0|Perfect Jazz collection 1, 2 and Columbia Jazz will give you 68 fantastic jazz CDs from Sony vaults.<br /><br />For novice jazz collector, this is an excellent opportunity to start jazz collection. For seasoned jazz lovers, some Cs sound better<br />than ones issued in the 1980s.
B003NX75B8|5.0|I loved this book!  It is really funny and yet has important things to say about friendship, about opening yourself up to life and making mistakes, and about accepting people and their flaws (including your own).  It also presents both straight and gay characters as friends where sexuality is not really an issue, just another facet of the person.  I have not laughed so much when reading a book in quite a while.  I also felt the heartbreak, redemption and joy of the characters.  Yes, the characters are all rather self-involved at times.  But, they are teenagers.  And as the story progresses they evolve and it was a hopeful message for me since I have to kids who will be teenagers in several years.  I enjoyed the tag-team method in which the story was told - alternating between Will and will (lowercase intentional) with Tiny as the thread running between them.  And, all the IM/text conversations - usually those annoy me in a book - but these really worked.  I had to wait in a long queue to check out the eBook from my local online library.  Normally, I am not big on waiting, but, in this case, I am happy about it.  It means a lot of people in my metro area have read or will read this book.  And, we need more people to read this book where I live!
0920668372|4.0|Wonderful bedtime story for all ages and one that I'm happy to have on my shelf to read to my children after being read it when I was a child.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|So you can buy games, or chat with friends, but you can't do the ONE THING you want steam for.<br /><br />I have a feeling that they might backload in game streaming features in the future, which would make this the best app ever.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Addiction to this awwwwwsomely free game!!!! I haven't stopped playing since I got it I love games like these especially when Its challenging
B00ACP3OOM|2.0|I swim a lot in a given week, often about 20 miles and a little music can help.  I ordered this thru Amazon because of its decent hold charge and the number of songs you can put on it.  The quality is decent considering you're in water...this isn't like you have Beats headphones on.  My problem is that this is my second Finish Neptune, and its the second to fail to turn on.  I noticed air bubbles in the screen-not sure if thats the problem.  Went on their website to complete a ticket.  It was going to cost over $30 to ship it back and they said that it was probably \\"user error.\\"  Excuse me?  Last time I checked, this device goes on the back of your head and unless your swimming with your head out of the water the entire time, its going to get wet. And I wasn't doing any deep sea diving, this was swimming in the pool/ocean. I made sure to \\"pat it dry\\" as the instructions told me to do and made sure to turn it off when done.  Time to find another brand I guess.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is the first time reading a book by John Green. My sister recommended it and I enjoyed reading this book. I found this story to be intriguing as he wrote from the eyes of a cancer patient. I will recommend this book to my friends.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This was advised to me by a grammy award winner friend, and it's indeed the best quality/price you can find on the market at the moment. Only negative point : no feedback on how full the battery is, there could be a small LED to let you know about it.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|Angry Birds if by far the most overrated game of all time. It's okay if you're very, very bored and looking for something mindless. App wise, this is fine. It's Angry Birds.
B003I55BIA|5.0|My students, male and female, are loving this book! They keep turning the pages! I have to admit, I kept turning the pages, too!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was very good. Will have a difficult time choosing a new book to read after this one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Not for the impatient. Really good game to build over time and keep up with the progress of your friends
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|Good movie differint plot, plus I am a Nicolas cage fan. Plenty of action. Have to pay attention to follow the plot.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|I've been an Elton John fan all of my life; I'm 57.  When I heard he had another CD out I wasn't excited; we are all getting older and I didn't expect a modern day equal to Yellow Brick Road.  After just one listen I was blown away.  Beautiful.  He has actually gotten better, improved with age.  It is so distinctly Elton, yet mature and ever more soulful.  It is just so beautiful.  I've had it one week and after the first few notes, tears come.  It feels like an old friend already.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|World of Goo is a pretty great game. But if you haven't already beat it 3 times, you won't get a world shattering experience from the tablet version. It's all the same, and it still looks good.
1449305172|5.0|I've read several of the lean books and Ash's is by far the best in my opinion. I found that having examples of how to apply lean that Ash used from personal experience to be the best way to really understand the concepts. This is a how-to book based on experience more than a theoretical book and that makes it very easy to grasp. Well done.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Be smart. Be selfless. Be honest. But above all, be brave. These are the basis for these wonderful books and I firmly believe that are the best way to live. Bad things happen in this book, but that is no reason not to read it. Be brave. It's worth it.
B009PMEEY2|3.0|its ok there are so many games out there that are truely basically the same idea they switch a few things around give it a new name
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Had difficulties getting it to work (quite a few resets) and then it's very limited relative to what can be accessed. I thought it would do more and was disappointed in its range of capabilities.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I was a bit sceptical when I realized this was another of those games where you have to spend money to extend playing time, but you can play for a longer period before you run out of energy. Again, though, there IS one element that is hard to come by, namely diamonds, which you need a lot of and they don't come easy w/o spending actual money. These games are a scam just like the city building games. It's like gambling but you know you won't actually win anything for all the money you have spent. I can see why their initial popularity has faded. Anyway, the game is more interesting than the rest of these, and if<br />you are willing to limit you're time and money  to play it can be quite fun!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Finally got around to reading this classic story. Don't wait as long as I did. Wonderfully written and a great twist at the end. Read it before you see the movie.
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|A good show to see, however, so far it seems to be very slow if you compare it versus the firts season.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This Is Epic Love This Book Its Funny. Jeff Kenny Put A Lot Of Work In This Awesome Book :)
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This set is a gift for a male friend.  He loved it and can't stop watching it.  Was worth the wait and pre-ordered price was great.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this! It has seriously helped me a lot in my walk with God. Can't wait to get even more plans started!
B006LSZECO|4.0|a bit tedious and fairly early signs of Amy being mentally unstable.  loved the addiction angle of relationship.  so applicable to a lot of relationships
1442359919|5.0|This was a great story. I loved it.<br />But I am also a huge Dean Koontz fan, especially his Odd Thomas series, and this book reminded me of them. The narrator even sounded the same. So I immediately felt comforted because the book felt familiar to me...is that weird? lol I love my books! Hardcover, paperback and most recently audiobooks.<br />I am comforted by the familiar books, like a long series, or a loved author and this book made me feel like I was reading another one of Odd Thomas's kooky mysteries....I have all my books in hard cover, and like to read them over and over again, every couple of years and it comforts me.<br />Did I mention they comfort me? lol ;)<br />I have been reading both Stephen King and Dean Koontz for over 25 years and I could read one of their books without knowing who wrote it, and easily tell you who wrote it, just by their writing style...but this one would have confused me. If the name of the character was changed to Odd Thomas, I'd believe it, (except for the couple times that King adds his normal, &#34;Do you believe that?&#34; statement in the book...lol...I always look for that statement now.... ;)<br />Anyway, it's a great story, a little short for my taste but good. I would have liked to see more from the characters. And no matter how hard I tried to picture the character as a red head, I just couldn't do it...<br />in my head, Odd Thomas kept popping up...lol<br />Enjoy it, it's well written and takes your imagination immediately....
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Awesome app.  Waited a long time for this one!  Works really well on the galaxy note 8.  Best strategy card game around.
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|Best show ever! Great acting, great filming, great everything.<br />A must see!<br />A little gory, but you get used to it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I've read many rants about this set.  I consider myself a strong Star Wars fan, but not obsessive.  I didn't have many of these movies on DVD, so I had a desire to have the full collection.  As a collection of science fiction movies these run from the fairly simple (Episode 4) to the amazingly complex (Episode 3).  I've looked at a few of the extras, and look forward to watching more of them.  Well worth the money and the time to look back at these movies, though I don't think the difference from DVD to Blu-Ray is worth buying them again..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that Candy Crush finally made its way to the Kindle! The game is so addictive but tons of fun!
B00DB624GS|5.0|I love the 'original' Fleetwood Mac and Peter Green.  As a guitarist, I cut my teeth on this guy as well as the likes of Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Santana, BB King, Stevie Ray Vaughan and the Allman Brothers.  I think Peter is less known but right up there with the others.  Their jams are off the charts and a must for any budding guitarist or jam band for that matter.  This is a must album!!!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I really liked this book because you can visualize almost every part like the sceen when August takes the tour with Jack,Juilian and Summer.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This app was good, but not great.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I also wouldn't tell people not to get it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game but very addicting once you start playing it. So if your a busy person with young kids this game is going to drive you crazy
1449305172|5.0|You should read Running Lean, because it distills lean from a philosophy into actual, practical steps (a methodology).<br /><br />I especially appreciate the problem & solution interview questions in Running Lean. When I'm doing interviews for a new product, I start with Ash's questions pretty much word-for-word. Then after 20 or so interviews, I've found that the questions have naturally evolved for my particular market/audience. As someone who finds interviews a bit scary, having a well-thought through interview script is critical for me to actually get the interviews completed.<br /><br />I recommend Running Lean more than any other book to new start ups founders. I even bought a copy for my mom when she transitioned from the private sector into the public sector!
B00003CXXM|4.0|This is a great series and Matt Damon does a real good job in his lead role.  I recommend this movie.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|Got this game after getting a new kindle fire.  The game is very fun imo and looks great on the fire.  The concept is simple...drive as far as you can before the zombies stop you.  As you progress through each day you earn cash to upgrade your vehicle.  Overall the gameplay is fun and the progression moves fast enough to keep you interested.  Not sure how many stages there are but I'm on the fourth now and it appears there is a good deal left.  Overall, worth the small amount of money to get the game.
B00FFVML74|3.0|I will watch anything with David Tennant it and he didn't disappoint. However I felt that the camera work was a bit overdone with odd angles and dramatic pauses feeling a bit insulting. I found myself saying \\"I get it: This is important.\\" Each episode ended with a cliffhanger, many of them red herrings, and by the end I felt that I was watching it more because I had to find out what happened rather than because I was enjoying myself. Having held on to the end, I really wish I hadn't though. It seemed a bit rushed and unsatisfying.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This app was good, but not great.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I also wouldn't tell people not to get it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now that the game is fixed, I am enjoying that I can challenge my FB friends to see who is the best.
B0088W7VNG|3.0|The main reason that I titled this in the manner shown is that I felt like plots and story lines began to be perforated with holes and that there was more a dependence on the successes of previous seasons.  It is almost as if the actors knew that they were in the throws of a series that was ending.  Really too bad!!!  I have enjoyed the whole spread of Stargate episodes, actors, and adventure since the nineties!
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|This is a great series and Matt Damon does a real good job in his lead role.  I recommend this movie.
1451695195|5.0|I had just lost my best friend when I got this, it really helped me a lot, I know she's safe.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I have tried several stylus and this one is the best.  It has 3 different size rubber pointers which really come in handy with different size devices, a pen-like clip, and it just feels right in your hand. It's a little more pricey than other stylus but if I added up all the money I spent on different stylus, I could have gotten several of these. This is the best one at least in my opinion and I plan on buying another.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|This app was good, but not great.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I also wouldn't tell people not to get it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Its awesome but really adictive. Be aware with  children. I would certainly recommended!!  Good game great colors and really fun.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This BBC production reminds me of why I have always liked BBC series on public television.  The actors make one feel that the watcher could personally live in Lark Rise or Candleford and be part of the community.  The manner in which emotions are tugged and thoughts are molded by the story-telling is unique and creative.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game. It is a lot of fun. The levels can get a little difficult at times, but I enjoy the challenge.
0525478817|5.0|I just love it,i think is one of those books that you just can't stop reading until you're done and happy but at the same time sad because you finish this amazing story :),i'm very happy about it
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Interesting premise but the author opted for easy outs. Fast read but not as compelling as I had hoped.  Average
1452126577|3.0|The book is great.  The construction not so much.  The budget was likely small, so they used a cheaper company...well, it's a rather cheap product.  It's a great book though.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Thank you Mr. Sanderson for the sweat and tears (and at least blood of imagery) and great care you have used to craft a most fulfilling ending to one of the most complex and epic stories of our times. I am certain mr. Jordan would be very pleased! Obviously with the depths of the story line this could have continued for another 10 books, but with a goal of completion you have gained much Ji in the depths of your caressing pen strokes. I have been reading and rereading these books (as the next editions were released) since the early 90's. And these works have had a profound impact on my life, nearly to the extent of J.R.R. Tolkein's master works. When Mr. Jordan passed I was more than distraught at these works being left unfinished. when you took the task on, I doubted you, and my own ego left me in doubt. I read the books you conspired on and awaited the final installment. As usual, I decided after the long wait for this book, to reread the entire series. And having just finished it all once again, only this time with the finality of the final book, I am left extremely satisfied. Thank you. I am aware that you faced many many difficult choices on how to effectively wrap up he story, especially with the myriad of loose threads and sub stories left by mr. Jordan's last book without you. I am in great respect of your skill, dedication, focus and creativity in the depth of the justice you have delivered to the legacy of Robert Jordan and to his readers. I also read your mistborne series as a result of coming into contact with you (found after reading your first work on the wheel of time), and I found your works to be of equal greatness, wonderful concepts of magic/allomancy, intrigue, character building, strategy. Congratulations on all fronts. Thank you again. Your fan, Chris Alpiar
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This movie is awesome!! And in 3d its even better! I highly recommend it, but definetely see the first movie before watching this one!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really fun game and works great, I'm so happy that kindle finally has this app, is a must have app, I'll 100% recommend it.
B002M9WW30|5.0|You cannot beat getting all of the Rocky movies for one price, especially on sale.  Shipping was very fast and the item was brand new.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app was good, but not great.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I also wouldn't tell people not to get it.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I also waited impatiently for this third book and was disappointed.  The first two followed Tris's expanding awareness of what life in the factions entailed, and what happened as it crashed.  THIS book, however, was all about conversations Tris and Tobias have with others regarding other people's understanding of the world around them,  not Tris or Tobias learning for themselves.  Totally different type of book full of conversations not action, not exciting or engrossing as the first two.<br /><br />It felt as if Roth did the big build up in books 1 and 2 in order to teach us the moral to her lstory in this final book.  If this was her purpose she failed, and lost reader devotion as a result.  Roth needs to decide whether she wants to teach or entertain her readers, not set up a bait and switch.<br /><br />Me?  I want to be entertained by a book I just can't put down.  Like the first two in this trilogy.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Wow! Did not see that coming. I would have had a different ending but because it ended this way doesn't make the story bad. The book is a emotional ride so be prepared for the ride while reading this book. I'm sure this book even had Veronica Roth in tears while writing it. I'm still crying and it's over.  I know a lot of people won't like this ending but life is life so sometimes it is good and sometimes it is bad.  This book is well written with lots of action so read it and don't let negative reviews keep you from reading this book.  Not everyone will be happy with the ending just read it for yourself to see if you like it.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|i love the game but it always restarts so what the heck! want a game that i can play without it restarting all the time i always have to download, download, and download this game like every month.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|what can I say? great price on batteries that would cost much much more in the stores..same batteries, ,but a much better price...and nice to have a few spares around for the next time I need one!
B004SDEP38|4.0|This app was good, but not great.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I also wouldn't tell people not to get it.
B001BANK32|5.0|Great stuff.  Seen the movie 100 times, now read the book.  Just wonderful - better than the movie, which was great.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I loved this book the first time I read it and I loved and appreciated this book this time again.<br />I chose this book to use for my Topic of Light discussions. Don explains easily and effectively. I liked that this wasn't thick heavy book filled with complicated lessons. Don uses great examples to explain the agreements and the way he explains them is simple and motivating.<br /><br />The agreements are easy to remember and make sense. I covered most my thoughts in the topics. I would recommend this book to any one needing a great short motivational read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game!  Totally hooked.  Some of the levels are more challenging than I would like, but that just makes me want to keep on playing.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|The acting was excellent (Rooney Mara's interpretation of Lizbeth Salander, Daniel Craig acting against his James Bond image, plus the character actors). The movie was fast-paced, and the English subtitles made for easy viewing.
B005V20JKI|4.0|This app was good, but not great.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I also wouldn't tell people not to get it.
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|movie was good.  disc with feature only worked fine, the 2nd disk with movie and other stuff didn't work at all
B004U8ZH8S|4.0|My husband & I had a sleepover with our soon to be 5 year old granddaughter she picked this movie out.  Little did we know she had already watched it several times and had the DVD!  But it was quite cute even for adults,especially if you are a grandparent!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I started to play this with my granddaughter who is 3. She loves her ponies but found myself wrapped up in this magical adventure. I love the ponies now as much as she does, and we spend lots of time curled up together.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I'm late to the party and have been hearing about how great this film is for a year and a half. Wow. It was every bit as good as I've heard, maybe even better than I was expecting. I say this as someone who was buying George Perez drawn issues of the Avengers 35 years ago. This is a great movie. I took the time to watch all the individual movies ahead of time and that was rewarding but not necessary. I couldn't recommend this movie more highly.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|This app was good, but not great.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I also wouldn't tell people not to get it.
B000ASATZ8|3.0|Okay,  truth.  I'm only the middleman; these particular items of bad cinema were gifts to my crazier-than-me younger brother.  His appetite for gross-out, violent bloody B-movies knows no bounds.  He loved 'em, as I thought he would.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The way that the relationship between a young girl and a ninety year old woman grows and unfolds with similarities is wonderfully done. This is a good book to talk about with others views.
B00E9A656K|5.0|This is a really great he I just don't understand the concept of the gas consumption thing. Otherwise  amazing game definitely recommend
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I bought my iPhone (4) several years ago and ended up buying this AmazonBasics product to encase and protect it.<br /><br />When my wife recently upgraded from her dumb phone to a smart phone, an iPhone 4, I searched again for a case and screen protector, and again, bought this AmazonBasics case/screen-protector product.<br /><br />I have zero complaints.<br /><br />Amazon did their homework on this item.<br /><br />.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This app was good, but not great.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I also wouldn't tell people not to get it.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|I PURCHASE THIS BLURAY THROUGH HESITATION ANY IT JUST NOT ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT ALIEN ATTACKING EARTH BUT ACTUALLY HAS A SCRIPT AND SUBPLOTS.
1449305172|5.0|My biggest frustration with the \\"lean\\" literature has been lack of a really solid \\"how to\\" guide.  I love the stories and general wisdom dispensed in other books, but very little of that can be directly taken and operationalized in my own work.  Ash fills that gap with Running Lean.  I use it regularly in both my day job and the startup I'm working to build.  A+
B00EVW0VTI|2.0|Hollywood has cooked up another action movie where the President/White House/Country is put in danger. Surprise! The bad guys are three or more of the following: white, angry, racist, ex-military,Republicans! Don't they ever get tired of themselves? Apparently not, because the know that if they keep telling the same lies/telling the same stories, the sheeple will believe them! Surprised that they didn't take a jab at Christians, gun control, birthers, etc. while they were at it. I am amazed to be living in an age where the media and Hollywood are so sold out to ideology, that they role out movies and manufacture stories to help bolster the failed foreign policy of the worst president in our nations history. By the way, grenades do not beep a countdown, RPG's CANNOT take out an Abrams tank, and I'm pretty sure the surface to air missiles cannot arm themselves that quickly, RPG's actually would have been the better option. Anyone see Black Hawk Down? Also, I'm pretty sure the National Guard would have rushed the White House lawn during the car chase along with the Abrams. BTW the Abrams didn't need to move, it could have put a SABOT round in each of the SUV's engines EASILY while they were doing donuts around the fountain. Anyway, the movie is not worth pointing out all of it's obvious errors and improbabilities (and there are many, many more). Don't buy this movie. I do have to say that when the White House docent took out that MERC like a boss with that big golden clock, I belly laughed.
B00338QENI|5.0|A very interesting book!  Rebecca Skloot does a great job of explaining any scientific details in plain English.  This book is for everyone!
1449410243|2.0|This book is literally in 3 pieces now (after only 1 reading).  The content is good, but it fell apart.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|THIS DISC SHOWS WHY KELLY CLARKSON IS A STAR. IT'S FULL OF HITS FOR BOTH THE DANCE AUDIENCE AND ROMANTIC FANS OF MUSIC. KELLY SHINES ON BOTH SINGLE AND DUETS.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|This is an awesome movie a must have for any marvel fan, a amazing add to the marvel universe. Amazing
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great game for little kids and anyone in general. I love this game keeps my little brother busy when they're bored.
1449305172|5.0|This is the best practical guide to executing on lean principles. Period. When I teach Lean, this is where I start.
B005GVF95O|4.0|This app was good, but not great.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I also wouldn't tell people not to get it.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|THE HITS AND  LOVE OF HIS MUSIC MAKES BRUNO A KING OF MODERN MUSIC. THE ARE APPEALING AND EASY ON EARS AND RELAXING.
1579129501|5.0|Its a great book. Excelent problems. Very instructional. The hard cover is beautifull. Highly recomended for any people that love chess.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Not King's absolute best but very good and very scary.  I'll never look at an RV or its inhabitants the same way again.
B0027MJU00|4.0|If you liked Flynn's other books you will definately enjoy this one too.  I did not find it as engaging as &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; but still you get to a point that you cannot let go of the book.  I really had a great time while reading it.
B004LUS390|4.0|This app was good, but not great.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I also wouldn't tell people not to get it.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I RATED THIS CD 5 STARS BECAUSE I LOVE EVERY SONG, BESIDE THE THREE RADIO HITS. IT SHOWS WITH EACH CD BRUNO MARS IS NOT JUST RESTING ON LAST HIT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE OF ANY MUSIC AREA
B00A2H9OZS|3.0|When I heard Riddick was coming out, I did not need to see a trailer or review.  There are two roles that were made for Vin Diesel.  One is Dominic Toretto.  The other is Riddick.  Unlike his character in the Pacifier, he was meant to play these two characters.  No matter what the critics say, I will go see Vin Diesel in any film he portrays these characters.<br /><br />On Riddick's opening night, I went to see the film.  I was disappointed. Riddick is almost the same exact film as Pitch Black.<br /><br />Aside from a few minor differences, this film contains many of the same elements.  Allow me to list them (Beware.  Spoilers ahead.):<br /><br />1.  The film takes place on a desolate planet that does not have much life.<br />2.  There are bounty hunters that want to capture him.<br />3.  There are monsters on the planet that want to eat all of them.<br />4.  The main plot is to get off the planet.<br />5.  Two hot women.  One will die.<br />6.  Scene of Riddick battling the monsters with his bare hands.<br />7.  Scene where Riddick cuts the monster in the stomach and its guts come out.<br />8.  Sexual frustration between the lead woman and Riddick.<br />9.  Monsters will come out of their respective habitats once the conditions are in  their favor.<br />10. Bounty hunters must work with Riddick in order to survive.<br />11. Takes the team through the monsters in order to reach their goal.<br /><br />I thought I was going to see a film with Riddick as the Lord King Marshall of the Necromongers.  I guess with a budget of $40 million, the makers of the film could not afford to create that storyline.  Chronicles of Riddick had a budget of just over $100 million.<br /><br />This is still a decent film, mainly because of Vin Diesel's charisma and on screen presence.  That is why I give the film 3 stars.  Add a star if you did not see Pitch Black.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|lots of flash, but not much story and very uninteresting characters.  The camerawork is so busy that there is no shred of reality.  What good is &#34;magic&#34; if it doesn't look real...  sigh.  disappointing.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Only thing I have bad to say about this movie is, why they didn't use the swords to begin with!
