B002WY65VU|5.0|Sure - you may quibble that there are not too many entries in this competition, but when it comes to Great Zombie Comedies, it's a pretty short list.  \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" may have the edge because it came first, but \\"Zombieland\\" is a wondrously funny, violent and human send-up of the over-saturated Zombie genre.    Ever since \\"Scream\\" burst on the scene, a calling card of a hip movie is to walk the viewer through The Rules.  \\"Zombieland\\" employs that cliche to great effect when we meet Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a twenty-something survivor of an unexplained zombie apocalypse - this introduction is found in close proximity to one of the most ingenious sets of opening credits ever devised.  Columbus - who could be Jonathan Cera's cousin - was never much of a people-person but now is desperate for human contact.  He finds it initially in Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a smash-mouth redneck who loves nothing more than shredding zombie faces.  Harrelson has that unique combination of sweetness and menace that makes him one of the most exciting actors in Hollywood - and he can play Southern as convincingly as anyone.  Tallahassee's rules are no less fixed than Columbus's, and soon they are bonding over zombie carcasses and the Quest for the Last Twinkie.    Tallahassee and Columbus soon find two attractive, intelligent young women (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) whose dedication to self-preservation may be a little extreme but provides some good comic moments.  Despite some initial mishaps, the foursome is soon on the road together, seeking salvation in a zombie-infested wasteland.    Thanks to a witty script, some pitch-perfect acting, and one of the most inspired cameos in all of film, \\"Zombieland\\" is a true delight.  No, this isn't \\"Casablanca\\" or anything close to it.  But for what it strives to be, it's hard to imagine a better effort.  High marks across the board.
030745455X|5.0|What a great book! I couldn't put it down, and I'm bummed that there are only 3 to the series. I've heard a rumor that Stieg Larsson had an outline for 7 more. I'm praying someone picks up the ball and ghostwrites them.
B001DHXT6G|2.0|First off my season 1 set is not a HD / DVD combo set it's just a regular DVD set. The packaging is a joke all you are paying for is the 3 hard outer cases. The DVD's are not well protected. No disc lables on them just the center ring telling you the season and disc #. This was a way for Paramount to have a cheap product and charge a hefty price. Some of the new effects are ok but will never beat the originals that I grew up with. Also CBS DVD must not believe in a play all feature. This is the second TV series by this company that I bought and you have to pick one episode at a time instead of watching the entire disc. In season 2 I don't understand why they put 1, 2, 3, or 4 episodes to a disc to have an 8 disc set. That was so that they could fill the hard outer case up. I also don't like these flimsy Episode Guide cards. If you had the VHS complete set there is a diffrence in order. To me the VHS set is by Production # and it is more in the correct order than the DVD set that goes by the original air date. This is going to take some time to get used to. My opinion $188 plus is to much for this cheap manufatured set. I probably would have been happier with the 2004 set from other reviews I have read.
B003LD9P4K|2.0|Well to start Ive been a diehard #1 fan of ELP since I got BSS for my 16th birthday in 1976. Any serious ELP fan will find something to love about this Bluray. I love it because Im in the Home Theater biz so its a technical audio and video gem of the band I have loved and admired for 30+ yrs..   That being said most will have to agree, if they are honest,  that most of the magic that made ELP a progressive rock legend is sadly gone. The laser intensity, the seamless, mind blowing musicianship has given way to a tired and obviously puppet like performance. Obvious is Keith's degenerative, now 3 finger playing and Greg's sorely lacking ANY real energy or soul in his performance. Carl is still Carl the one and only, banging away with much energy  and is probably the cohesive bond still bringing these guys together.     I found the TARKUS arrangement to be the highlight and was played with as much more enthusiasm than most of the other songs (biased  you bet).   To me the sound is excellent and earned an extra star.  The video looks great but the camera editing is amateurish at best with very annoying and awkward scene changes and panning.  Im sure to play this BR many times to come.......  just sighing at the end wishing for the good ol days.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|not a thesis, just my opinion :) great cd. just got it today and had enough time to listen to it all the way through once and then kept repeating \\"all the lovers\\" and \\"better than today\\"...my favorite two songs on the disc. though i enjoyed the body language cd and the X cd this is probably kylie's best effort since the fever cd maybe even the impossible princess cd. aphrodite a great summer time cd. if you are a kylie fan then i know you're already going to get this no matter what anyone writes for a review or how many stars anyone gives it. if you are a casual listener and enjoyed some of her bigger and better known songs then you will like this cd...it's fun, accessable and a great 2010 release!
B00243FQFA|4.0|I got frustrated with hunting for good quality episodes on the Internet, so I broke down and got the final box set to add to my collection. I fail to understand why the series was canceled after only five seasons. &#34;Atlantis&#34; could easily continue for  two or three more. The writers left many questions  unanswered. Will the Wraith be defeated or just rendered harmless? Will the lost tribe of Asgard reintegrate into the Pegasus galaxy and form an alliance with the humans? How many more bodiless Replicators are out there? Are there more runners scattered about the galaxy?  With a few exceptions (&#34;The Seed&#34;), Season 5 of &#34;Stargate Atlantis&#34; maintains the high quality storytelling and sheer unbearable suspense seen from day one of the series. The possible solution to the Wraith problem seems humane. The frequent appearances of &#34;Todd&#34; are not only a delight to watch, but also give you hope that Wraith and humans will be able to share the galaxy, but there is enough treason to make you lose that hope. The appearance of Asgard is an unexpected but pleasant surprise that rekindles your hope there will be a way to resolve the conflict. The revival of FRAN/Dr. Weir is long overdue, but does not close the matter completely. The homage to &#34;CSI&#34; in the penultimate episode is well done.  With &#34;Stargate Universe&#34; falling short of the first two series, I hope the writers will put some effort into a few DVD release movies to tie up some of the loose ends that are dangling before us devoted fans.
B001EN71DG|4.0|Its frustrating to own the new, ruined, disgustingly awful versions of the original star wars trilogy. But the \\"extra feature\\" discs with the unaltered ORIGINAL original films are fantastic. A lot of reviews said their picture and sound quality were sub par, but they're just as good as you would expect from a thirty year old trilogy. That kind of remaster-everything attitude is what got us the new ones, with jar jar binks and hayden christensen strolling through the background. Buy this, throw out the new versions and keep the special features.
031606792X|5.0|Really, as far as anything goes, I loved the series! But Breaking Dawn was the best, hands down! I was introduced to the series in 8th grade, but didn't really want to read it. Vmapires? I hated vampire stories! But then I decided I better give this one a try, and am I glad that I did! The story was entrancing! Edward was incredible, Bella was relatable, the plot was suspenseful and the romance breath taking! As for this book, I loved it! I was happy that Bella let Alice do the wedding and that Bella loved it, I was glad that Edward and Bella went to Isle Esme and became truly one, and I think the twist with Renesmee was a nice twist. I hated Jacob's point of view except for the insiders veiw of how the wolfy thing worked, and I was thrilled that Bella survived and got eveything that made the story a happy ending. The Jacob imprinting on Renesmee was brilliant in my view, and it finally got Jacob out of the way for disrupting one of the greastest romances in history! Yes, a battle with the Vultori would have added something to the plot, but then again, would you have really wanted to see some of your favorite characters die? I wouldn't have! After all people, this is just a story to entertain the public and not meant to be realistic! Its fantasy and fiction and there to make you feel emotions for fantastic characters! Stop whining that not everything was a tradgey and just realize that the story was entertaining! As a fellow author, I bow to Stephanie Meyer for inspiring me during writer's block and entertaining me with a vampire story that I fell in love with!
B002KSPKRS|1.0|Ez to set up, but I have a wireless (wifi) connection, and the only way I can hear this with out \\"PoPs\\"/\\"Hiss\\" and total interuption is if I turn off my internet..... kills the purpose of this for gaming! (unless you play offline!)<br /><br />Bass is terrible! there is no BASS! surround sound my ass, excuse my french.... I have a Creative X-Fi souround card and when it was detecting the speakers it failed misserably.... never had to return anything to Amazon, but im not keeping 165 dollar item for nothing, dont waste your time and get the the ACP TRI-GA600, or what i am using atm a Sony MDR-IF540RK.
B001QWBM62|4.0|This is a real handy machine.  Small, portable, easy to use.  Well worth the dough.
B003JR1UTG|5.0|None of my friends really listen to the same music as me, but if they did I would definitely recommend this album! I still talk about it all the time, even when people don't give a ... crap. The music is fun, and the lyrics are pretty good considering English isn't Jonsu's first language. And it's kind of cool how it's all the same music we've come to love from before, but now with new English lyrics. So you already love it, just in a new way. They are definitely different songs, but still just as catchy and fun as their Finnish counterparts. Good times had by all!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This is my 3rd CD. I gave it to my sister and brothers, and they love the compilation of songs.  It has all of MJ's good hits way from pre-Thriller to Thriller.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Very useful for anything with an optical in device such as your desktop or tv and such. Works great for the xbox 360 and even works with the PS3 (I use a Bluetooth device for speech so everything is wireless on PS3) I would highly recommend it. Great sound and for the price it could be a little better. Sometimes there IS static. Overall it works just fine. Maybe the later models will adhere to the aforementioned issues.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Even though there are a lot of apocalyptic movies coming out lately, this one is unique in it's story line and the way it was shot. No matter what your beliefs, it's a good movie and had a couple of twists that I didn't see coming. Plus I'm a big fan of both Denzel Washington and Mila Kunis
B003G88WTO|5.0|Just wanted a chance to give this record 5 stars. That's it. Tracks 1, 7 and 8 are major stand outs. Perfect Sunday material.
B002ZG98J6|4.0|My labor coach took me to see this movie after I started early labor with my second child. (hubby was deployed) I definitely kept me entertained so I could relax in between contractions. Very good movie!
B002ZG97RY|4.0|I really enjoyed the Bourne trilogy with Matt Damon directed by Paul Greengrass.  I had read a lot of mixed reviews about how GREEN ZONE was not true to military standards & the filming was too much hand held filming giving you a bit of motion sickness.  On the strength of the Bourne movies I bought the Blu Ray.  I found the movie to be good in terms of Blu Ray quality but not excellent due to the hand held filming method & low light filming.          I found the movie itself to be very enjoyable and quite believable in regards to the storyline & political games Washington plays.  Did Washington fabricate the WMD story?  Maybe they did, maybe they did not........ but this slant is one possible truth that we probably will never learn.    I did not see any anti-American or Anti-Military flavor to the movie.  They just raise the possibility that some high placed people wanted the U.S. to invade Iraq with or without WMDs.  It reflects the fact that military men & politicians blindly follow orders  from higher up and do as they are told.  Some men however question the orders they receive and look for the real underlying truth .        This movie is fiction based loosely on real events.  I was not looking for a true to life documentary ........but just good escape entertainment.  Very entertaining film...... if you liked the Bourne movies you will likely enjoy GREEN ZONE.
B000BMPQUG|5.0|I love this music, it's upbeat with some great lyrics. If you aren't aware of the history of this band you will find it fascinating. I wish they would tour in the United States.
B000003CUJ|1.0|SHORT REVIEW: If you have perfect pitch, or even relative pitch, this recording will cause you pain.      After listening to the full version of Wagner's \\"The Ring\\" many times, I decided I to look for some orchestral cues because sometimes one isn't in the mood for over zealous tenors and high strung sopranos.  I decided on this recording due to the reputation of the Berlin Phil and from listening to other online samples Amazon had provided.  It SEEMED to be the best for the price and downloadable options.  Unfortunately for my ears, this was a POOR CHOICE, and I got what I paid for.  The short samples and my lousy laptop speakers apparently hid the fact that a majority of the orchestra is horribly out of tune. The opening track begins about a 1/4 tone flat--especially the first chair french horn, and he/she continues to play flat for the entire recording while the strings and woodwinds are sometimes sharp.  I understand that Wagner is not the easiest to perform, but playing in tune is something we musicians learned to do in grade school.    If you have no tonal frame of reference, you may be able to sit through these tracks, but if so, do yourself, and Wagner, a favor and keep looking for something else.  I know I will.  (Luckily, I purchased the \\"MP3 Album\\" so I'm only out $9.00.)
B00003CXAA|5.0|Title says it all! What more is there to say? Great acting, great directing, great soundtrack. All 3 parts flow together like magic. There, I guess I found something to say LOL!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Isn't it stupid to review a product that isn't out yet? These reviews should be for the product you are buying (Not Out Yet), in this case the BLU-RAY (Audio/Video/Extras). If you haven't seen this movie or want to know if it's any good, there are more than plenty of reviews on the internet or rent it first.
0060786523|5.0|I love this book.  It combines history, perspective and yes, family drama.  But why can't they make this electronic so I don't have to carry around 1500 pages.  For all of you who agree, please post a message to Amazon, that you would like this for the Kindle.  Then, this would be the perfect format for the perfect book.
0920668372|1.0|I guess I'm the only one here who   finds it very frightening that the  woman would actually continue treating  her son as an overgrown baby! I wonder  how many people (male or female)would  really enjoy having their mother rock them to  sleep at the age of thirty or stalk them  across town or even across the country,  climb into their bedroom window and  stare at them as they lay sleeping.  Very few I am sure!  The author has revealed a lot more than he   intended. This book frightened me when  I was small and the fear hasn't diminished   any now that I'm grown.  p.s.Yeah,I know that he lost two children  but he still could've written a much less  disturbing book,nonetheless.:\    p.p.s.I've seen women like this on the   Dr.Phil Show.: 
0545123283|5.0|Maggie has done it again! Linger delivered a fantastic follow-up to Shiver  that left me drooling like a wolf. The beautiful, poetic writing I remembered in the first novel continued to warm my heart. Maggie's way with words are distinct and have the ability to move mountains. Grace and Sam's relationship blossomed and I enjoyed seeing their love come to light even more after the change. In my eyes, Sam will forever stay the sweetest character in YA. The way he carried himself through rough situations proved how much he loved Grace. If only all guys acted like Sam, all would be right in the world. But, then we would never have characters such as Cole, a newly infected wolf who was a complex rock star with demons. He was perceived as cocky and different from the others. At first, he was a mystery but once I started peeling back his layers I started to sympathize with him.<br /><br />Another individual I got to know better was Isabel, Jack's sister. She was very entertaining from start to finish. Isabel's blunt personality definitely helped her get away with a lot of questions others wouldn't be able to ask. On top of that, she was hilarious and I caught myself laughing out loud. As for the lovely Grace, she was still an amazing, down-to-earth character that I admired and respected. By the end of Linger, I was surprised and shocked. The twist left me eagerly anticipating the third book Forever. It's just unfortunate that I have to wait until next year! Maggie yet again blew me away and I look forward to seeing how Sam and Grace deal with the new obstacles in their relationship.
B001F0WXY0|4.0|The story is great. But the price is wrong. The publisher has no printing cost, no distribution cost, and worst of all no one bothered to proof read it.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This c.d. is incredible. Give it a week or two to get stuck in your head, and to familiarize with it. Its completely different from his last two albums (Relapse and Encore). He's back on track and better than ever. Now, dont expect him to be exactly the same as Eminem Show or Slim Shady LP, because he's not. He's got a better flow, better beats, better choruses, better punch lines...better everything. He's not spending all his time making fun of ppl, he's just flowing and rapping as smooth as ever. This album is definately worth buying. The double-cover thing is pretty sweet too.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|According to Amazon, I am the 97th reviewer to award a 5-star rating to this absolutely lovely movie, so I will keep my review short.      \\"Hachi\\" is a beautiful, quiet, touching, and extremely moving film.     As others have remarked, the film affects one deeply--I cried my heart out while watching the film, and I was still sniffling while running an errand the day after I saw the movie.      Viewing \\"Hachi\\" also made me want to share this film with others, and I have been spreading the word to family and friends who would enjoy this little sleeper hit.      It was funny that my family watched \\"Hachi\\" as part of a \\"double feature\\" of films we checked out of the library.  The other movie was \\"2012,\\" a truly awful film that with all of its expensive CGI effects of the world being destroyed did not possess one iota of the power and grace of the the quiet, dignified little \\"Hachi\\" movie.      I can back up my review with my wallet. I bought the DVD for my home collection and plan to buy at least two more copies as gifts for friends who are dog-lovers, one whose dog showed similar love and loyalty to his owner at a time of crisis. I have not bought any movie for myself for a year and a half, but I wanted to reward those involved in making such a lovely film.    One caution is that even though \\"Hachi\\" is rated G and is found in the children's section of my local library, \\"Hachi\\" is not really a kids' movie. If you have a sensitive child, you might want to preview the film first, as some of the events shown in the movie are very sad.    \\"Hachi\\" is an excellent choice for anyone who loves dogs, who has a heart not made of stone, and who does not require car chases, explosions, and Uzis to enjoy a movie.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|First of all for those who haven't noticed the reviews that are here are for two different box sets. One set is a large silver box and the other is black and comes with a collectible cylon. This review is for the silver box set. This box set includes all of the episodes from the series and also the miniseries. It also contains Razor and The plan. The Plan is sometimes missed because it is in the same case as disk 4 of season 4. On the outside of the case there is no mention of it at all but it is there. I didn't even know it was there until I opened the case to watch disk 4. Each disk also has lots of deleted scenes, commentary, and other special behind the scenes features. This is a great series and box set.
B000001ELF|4.0|Ace Frehley (1978) was Ace's solo album when each of the four members of Kiss recorded their own separate solo albums in 1978.  It's the best album of the four.  The album has some cool tracks, such as Rip It Out, Ozone, a remake of New York Groove, Wiped-Out, and the instrumental Fractured Mirror.  The music is hard and simple, but the bottom line is that it rocks.<br /><br />I think Ace's voice is pretty good.  Kiss should have had him sing a lot more songs.  He only sang a few during his time with Kiss.  I think it's cool that all four members of Kiss sing songs rather than having just one lead singer.  Blue Oyster Cult does the same thing.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid album that rocks.  Ace is a great guitar player.  The next best solo album from 1978, in my opinion, was Paul Stanley's.
0060594896|5.0|Jack Canfield writes so everyone from every walk of life can understand the ideas and principles that make up the foundation of all of life. He teaches you that you can easily navigate through life once you realize that your thoughts about life create your reality and your experiences. He uses repitition to help you really understand the material.I have given away copies to friends and relatives and even an inmate in jail. After reading The Success Principles he was able to figure out some things about his life and create his goals for the future. I highly recomend this book for anyone who is looking to create a new and better life for themselves.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|I love everything about the AmazonBasics Camera Case for Digital Cameras.  My new Kodak EasyShare M341 fits perfectly inside it as well as my Samsung Knack 3110 cell phone.  This is a very versatile case for carrying small electronic equipment.  It looks and feels durable and should last many years.  It's the type of camera case you can carry with you when participating in outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, sightseeing, etc., or when attending special indoor ceremonies such as weddings, retirements, baby showers, etc.  Reasonably priced, it makes a great gift.<br /><br />  The case's interior is very roomy.  There is an individual front pouch for my flash memory card as well as the protective plastic case in which the card was shipped to me.  In the rear pouch, one could store a spare battery or tiny instruction booklet.  I put the camera's cord inside this pouch to prevent it from scratching the LCD screen.  Speaking of cords, I am very glad this case has its own cord; I don't have to use the camera's cord and risk breaking it.<br /><br />  Also, what makes this case perfect for the outdoors is that it is indeed water resistant.  I placed the flap underneath my bathroom's water faucet and ran a steady stream of water on top of it.  The water ran off the flap.  The surface underneath, which would be touching the camera, remained dry.  However, I don't recommend dropping the case into a body of water.  The case would best protect the camera during light to moderate rain - not a hurricane.  It is water resistant, not waterproof.<br /><br />  The case's flap closes with a large piece of Velcro.  Also, the belt loop is rather large and will go through most men's belts; it easily fastens and remains securely attached to the belt.  The case is very comfortable to wear.  I easily forgot it was there when my parents and I were touring the Outer Banks in North Carolina.  I had no difficulty removing my camera from the case when it came time to take a photograph.  Whenever I bent or stooped over, the case stayed attached to my belt.<br /><br />  Furthermore, the case comes with a limited one-year warranty from Amazon.  It arrived in a frustration-free cardboard box which was easy to open; the box is sturdy and durable enough to use over and over for storing the camera case when it is not in use.  I will definitely be using the AmazonBasics Camera Case as the chief case for carrying my digital camera.  It is the perfect accessory for my Kodak EasyShare M341.<br /><br />Joseph B.

B0024Y9EYS|4.0|I would have given the show five stars but the suits at Warners couldn't make up their mind in which direction to go.  The plot would change on a dime leaving episodes hanging and turn in a new direction.  The producers said that it was because Sarah kept pulling up stakes and settling somewhere else. Lena Headey, a British actor did an outstanding job portaying Sarah, a messed up American girl, made so by the establishment who wouldn't believe her story.  I fell in love with Summer Glau who portrayed the teenage Terminator, Cameron.  One of the reasons why the show didn't make it was that a lot of mothers didn't want Cameron to be a role model for their little girls and would not let them watch the program; one such mother was my niece. Others complained that it came on during the family hour and should have come on later because of all the violence.
B000000WFZ|5.0|So glad to get our hands on this music - which is gorgeous.  We saw the movie and wanted the music.  You don't usually find this in the stores.
B001TK3XPE|4.0|forget the \\"changing places\\" and \\"small world\\" nostalgia!   David Lodge (and the academic world) has grown up!  this is a touching, thoughtful story (and yes, often hilarious), well worth the read.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This sure brought back memories of my childhood...we would gather around TV and have waffle sundaes when Walt Disney shows comes on Sunday.  It sure is to watch these as the morals and lessons are good for kids and adults as well.  It is also a clean story.
0195067142|5.0|I am moved by this book.  I am a Marine and can relate in a way to Eugene Sledge.  Great book !
B000WGWQG8|5.0|As a teacher, I show parts of the first and second episodes in my classroom.  I only wish I had time to show the entire thing.      There are departures from the McCulloch book, but any screenplay would have to be quite heavily adapted from all the material he put forth.    An amazing miniseries.  Every American should watch it.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|There are very few movies made today that have the artistic and intellectual content that this picture contains.  Great acting on all 3 of the leads! My expectations were far exceeded!  A Must see!
0385341008|5.0|One of the most wonderful books that I have read in a long time. I felt like I was friends with the characters and I was sad to see them go at the end. It will always be one of my favorites on my bookshelf!
1423101499|5.0|All of the Percy Jackson books are awesome! I completely recommend this book and the other books in the series. It is a must read!
B003ELOQCK|5.0|Bought this for my husband and he loved it.  only thing is its just DVD not CD would love to have it on CD
B000022TSW|5.0|Yes its vulgar and yes it borders on gross but it is an awesome movie. I can't help but laugh at the antics that go on in the plot and even more so at the songs. This movie isn't for everyone and definately not for children but for everyone else give it a chance and enjoy.
B0037QGS0A|2.0|Although there are excellent actors, this particular movie had an incredibly contrived plot line. It just did not hold up and the interactions among characters were distracting. I recommend renting or buying the original French film \\"Nathalie\\" with Emmanuelle Beart and Fanny Ardant. There is a very captivating drama.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I ordered this as a gift for my best friend, price was good, shipping time was perfect! Thank You!
B0021L8V1G|5.0|I have no idea why some people are calling this a bad movie. I loved this movie. I kept catching myself leaning forward in my seat with my mouth open and my eyes wide. I felt like a little kid. I haven't had a movie do that for a long time. The effects were wonderful. I can't wait until it comes out on dvd.
B00001OH1S|4.0|Loved this CD! Just in time for a birthday present after watching the movie on television. Super fast delivery and I didn't pay for the 'express' delivery either.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|The special effects are great ( mostly ) the story line stupid . All in All bad movie
B001G5ZNE6|5.0|We have enjoyed listing to the record and loved that it came with a cd too!
0545123283|5.0|This was one of those books that I couldn't stop reading.  I should have been working, or cooking dinner, or cleaning, but instead I was reading.  I loved it.  I don't see how I am possibly going to wait for the last installment of this trilogy.  This is one of those series that you become so involved with the characters that you feel like you really connect and get all of them.  I have read books where the characters are just there to facilitate the story, but here the story IS the characters.  They are quirky, and lovably messed up in their own ways.  This is up there on my list of favorite books of all time.  I am going to read Shiver and Linger over and over.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|Nice collection. Just wish they would have marked the seasons on each booklet, not just the episode number.

B0002WYS6S|5.0|Great concert! Awesome tracks too!! Instrumedley was fantastic as well as the solos. Best Dream Theater DVD!
0307454541|1.0|This is possibly the worst book that I have picked up in years.  I never bother to write reviews but felt that others should be saved from the misery that is this book.  The characters were totally without depth despite pages and pages of text devoted to their backgrounds.  I was not interested in the main character.  The girl was interesting but I couldn't understand why the author ( who must be a misogynist of the highest order) would have allowed such abuses.  Do yourself a favor and SKIP THIS OVERRATED POS.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Even though I prefer Halloween 2, this is a great classic that I will never get tired of. Even as time passes by, it will still be one of my favorite horror films. If you're a horror fan and you haven't seen this, you REALLY need to.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|I have watched the original DVD release a number of times. Watching the Blu-ray with additional scenes was like watching the movie for the first time all over again! (except I did know how it would turn out). The additiional scenes add much more than a few minutes of film. In some cases they actually help clarify the context of a larger passage. The Blu-ray resolution allows the viewer to see many details that are indistinct in the DVD further adding to the sense of newness. The other features in the package like the digital copy, theatrical version on Blu-ray and DVD version and other stuff make for a one purchase covers all options solution. (Pity the digital copy and DVD aren't extended) I have happily upgraded from the standard DVD from years back, and am looking forward to investing the subsequent Ultimate Edition movie releases as funds permit.
0670021652|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" but this book is AWFUL! In fact I never finished it. It wasn't worth my time so I took it back to the library after I read about half of it. I couldn't help but think Gilbert was being asked to write another book after the success of EP&L and so she chose the only topic she could think of. She spends waaaaaay too much time agonizing over whether or not to get remarried and even suggests being 'forced' into it by the U.S. Government. Don't waste your time. Or money.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|I fell for the show instantly! It was gripping, had an interesting and developing plot, an epic finale (which I really hope isn't the end), great cast, great characters and it was always so much potential for this show to advance even further. It is so rare for me to like EVERY character and every actor in a show. This was the best new series and even though I loved V too, I would have saved FF because it had developed the most, showed the most promise and just had an overall higher quality. Sci-Fi at its best and it is really needed now that Lost is over! FF has fans here in Norway too, so please bring it back!
B003T6GVWI|5.0|I never like all the songs on an album, but this one from Kylie is just great. In times like these all you want is a breath of fresh air, and this album makes you wanna dance and just be happy and relax. How can you go wrong?
B0030N8Y4S|5.0|This review is a review for the entire show and season 8. I do not wish to write a review for every episode so this will be the one for everything that I have watched.     About a month ago I fell upon the show 24. I started from season one and went to the end non stop. I rented a lot of DVD's and purchased a lot of episodes through amazon.com. I have to say that in my life I have watched a lot of shows and this show along side Dexter are my absolute favorite. Kiefer Sutherland is by far the best actor in a TV series that I have ever watched. Everyone said that after season 3 of 24 the show went downhill. I can see why they assumed that because of the dramatic drama in season 3. I continued to watch despite the other reviews but I can say with out a doubt that the show escalated from then on. This show strikes your imagination to wonder if stuff like this actually happens in real life. It makes you wonder are there people out there that will do what ever it takes to protect their country, to serve. Once you watch this show you can understand why I am so eager to talk about this. If you are reading this and you haven't seen the previous episodes I implore you to stop and watch the episodes from day 1. \\"I give you my word\\" that you will not be disappointed. Season's 1-7 are on Netflix instant queue so watch them there for free. Make sure you watch 24 Redemption because Season 7 you will be lost trust me.     Season 8 was an amazing and yet depressing season. Kiefer Sutherland put on a exploratory performance. It was made just that much better with the help from Freddie Prinze Jr. Every episode makes you just want more and you can't turn it off. I am glad that I waited to the end of the season to watch everything because if I hadn't I would be sitting at the edge of my seat waiting for the next weeks episode to start. I must say however that I wish this show would go on. But everything good thing must come to an end. The ending of this show just makes you want more. Ihope the Kiefer Sutherland makes more shows/movies that as compelling as 24. I hope everyone enjoyed the show as much as I did. I honestly can say that I can not find anything bad to say about this show, or this episode. I hope you enjoyed reading this.
B00354Y9ZU|5.0|I found this book really inspiring, at some point I thought it was written for me, I recognize myself in many behaviors that Seth is promoting in the book. I also found a lot of new ways i can explain those concept to people around me.<br />A lot of things are what I'm trying to push to people in the company.<br />Some parts are also a strong challenge to the way I act and behave, to be honest i think the lizard brain is always ready to fight my innovative ideas.<br />I find one limit in being a bit too individualistic, everything is about YOU and YOU and YOU (this is why i say it sounds a bit too american for an european - Italian).<br />I always found that most of my innovations and creative ideas come from crossover, connection, fights and open debate with other individuals, not just from myself. I also have a lot more fun interacting with people and finding new ideas together than in isolation.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the blues but was not a Cyndi Lauper fan until I heard this CD.  Sure, some songs are better than others, but she does an incredible job singing the blues.  I only hope she makes more blues CDs.
B003EV6DBM|3.0|The writing is very uneven for this 5th series. Gone are everything familiar about the show in the past except the Tardis.  Matt Smith is good as the Doctor. His portrayal offers a more quirky Doctor and Karen Gillian is fun too, I just think Moffat, whom I had a lot of faith in, hasn't quite gotten in the groove yet. Time to bring back some of the writers from the previous series and get it back on track. The season ender is a step in the right direction. The Lodger is step in the wrong.
B0039TD7PY|1.0|I know what Carole King has accomplished in her life before.      This is abysmal.  Don't blame the recording either.  King CAN'T stay on key.  Don't tell me it's \\"soul\\" she is completely tone deaf.      This would be okay for a high school production.  This is what you might expect from an american idol audition that DIDN'T make it to Hollywood.  For an office karaoke party this would be an okay level of talent.  Anything else is unaccepatable.      It makes me ill to think of the talent that exists and doesn't make it when this is hailed as a triumph.  This is crap.  Only the most sentimental about Taylor and King will like this CD.
0780624157|4.0|The best matches on the tape were The US tag team title match between The Nasty Boys(Brain Knobbs & Jerry Sags) & The Steiner Brother(Rick & Scott)from 1990,The World title match between Hulk Hogan & The Giant(Paul Wright)from 1995,The steel cage tag team brawl between the team of Sting & Ric Flair against the team of Terry Funk & The Great Muta(1989) and the world title match between Sting & Sid Vicious(1990). The worst matches were the \\"Monster truck\\" match between Hogan & Giant(1995) and the Chamber of Horrors match between Team Sting & Team Cactus Jack(1991). The rest were ok. The only match should have been on the tape was the Eddie Guerrero-Rey Misterio-mask vs Crusierweight title match which was a high-flying,hard-hitting showstealer. I give this tape a 6 out of 10.

0143038419|5.0|I thought this was a great read!  The author, who is going through a rough time in her life, decides to take a year off and travel with specifics in mind.  She travels to Italy to experience pleasure, India to learn devotion, and Indonesia to acquire a balance.  I found myself empathising with Gilbert and also found many of her thoughts to be eerily similar to mine.  Her brave travels were educating and wonderfully fun, as she has great wit.  What a pleasure to read.  I certainly didn't want this book to end and loved every moment from the great dishes in Italy to the sadness and anxiety of a difficult break-up.  Everything comes together in Indonesia and the candid, sweet medicine man in Bali was just perfect!

B001AQO3WY|5.0|As a retired infantry Marine I found the portrayals extremely accurate and consistent with infantry and comm Marines. I served from 1982 to 2006 in the infantry and have to say that I saw a lot of my men in all the characters from the miniseries. The only problem I had as a senior enlisted Marine was the portrayal of SgtMaj Sixta, being a 9999 myself I saw a bunch of wanna be hardasses in the SgtMaj billet but none as over the top as his character, had I personally I would have slapped some sense into him. I thought the language was spot on, I thought the grab ass was spot on, I also thought the conversations regarding ethnicity and backgrounds were spot on accurate and I had no problem with the realism expressed. Overall what I saw on the screen was a highly trained recon/infantry unit performing outside the box of their comfort zone and doing so superbly. I also thought the mix of real Marines and actors and the technical expertise expressed was exceptional. Well done and bravo zulu to all involved.   Tory Kitchen  USMC Ret
0743298039|1.0|This is a rare miss from Amazon reviews, I'm definitely in the minority. I finished it out of pure stubborness. Really not a likeable soul in the book. Incest, feral children, self-abuse, Mary Poppins (without the flying), the moors, a biddable maiden narrator, creaking manor homes, a \\"ghost story\\" without a ghost...just painful.
1441866868|3.0|There's a lot to be said about this novel, both positive and negative, but since hardly anyone is going to read this review (there are far too many reviews to slog through already), I'm going to indulge myself by focusing on one point that rankled me. (We Amazon Vine(tm) members are obligated to write reviews of the free swag we get--that's the only reason I'm bothering to write this at all.)<br /><br />In the future world that Bacigalupi depicts, fossil fuels have all but completely run out. Therefor, human and animal muscle power have become virtually the only sources of energy. Um... what? What about solar power, nuclear power, hydroelectric power, wind power, wave power, tidal power, geothermal power, etc., etc., etc.? Coal and biomass-generated methane get some mention, but for all intents and purposes, this future world runs on muscle power. Even less realistically, mechanical springs are apparently the only method used to store this power. (No batteries, compressed air, high-tech flywheels, no extraction of hydrogen from water, etc., etc.?) \\"Spring pistols\\" are even the hand weapon of choice, as if Bacigalupi thinks gunpowder is a petroleum product.<br /><br />I'm not suggesting that the various \\"alternative\\" sources of energy will necessarily make for a painless transition from fossil fuels. But it's clear that Bacigalupi's scenario is vastly unlikely, even downright silly. I suspect that this isn't because his knowledge of science and technology is lacking. Rather, I think it's because this is how he wanted his world to be--how he wanted it to \\"look\\", realistic or not. This muscle-and-spring world offers him some striking visuals and also the metaphor upon which the title is based. A more realistic future world wouldn't have given Bacigalupi the \\"look\\" he wanted, so he dispensed with realism. In other words, he creates a world much in the vein of steampunk: he picks and chooses which technologies--real and imagined--his world will have, based on his esthetic vision, rather than any attempt at authenticity. Personally, I think this works fine for steampunk fiction. But steampunk is a light, tongue-in-cheek genre that doesn't take itself seriously. Bacigalupi's novel, on the other hand, is dark to the point of grimness, and takes itself seriously to the point of tedium.<br /><br />To my thinking, this mix of serious and not-serious doesn't work very well. How concerned can you be for the plight of characters when they live in an Alice-In-Wonderland world -- a world where common sense has been suspended for the sake of the author's sense of esthetics?<br /><br />The Audio:<br />Since I'm reviewing the audiobook version of this novel, a few notes on the narration: Overall it's good; narrator Jonathan Davis has a clear, pleasant voice and he reads at a nicely measured pace. My sole disagreement was with the accent he adopts when reading the dialog of Asian characters. There are a lot of Asian characters, and the listener is acutely aware of the fact that Davis is \\"putting on\\" a pretty thick accent for all of them. I was unhappily reminded of the caucasian actors who played Charlie Chan, or Marlon Brando's infamous performance as an Okinawan version of [[ASIN:1400096766 Stepin Fetchit]] in \\"The Teahouse of the August Moon\\". A more subtle hint of an accent would have been much less grating, IMO.c vision, rather than any attempt at authenticity. Personally, I think this works fine for steampunk fiction.

B000005YZM|5.0|While Odessey and Oracle is a super melodic and consistent album from beginning to end, it's probably not better than the majority of the Beatles, Kinks, Who and Rolling Stones classic albums.  It's just one of several really superb pop albums from the late 60's but nothing truly groundbreaking.      In that respect, Odessey and Oracle would be perfect for the category of \\"second best\\" pop albums of the decade, which is where Love's Forever Changes, the Pretty Things S.F. Sorrow, and Family's In a Doll House fall under.  Hey, that's *still* a magnificent place to be.  In fact, with all the praise the Beatles and Stones constantly receive, you might just prefer to check out the Zombies instead.    What makes Odessey and Oracle shine so brightly is the fact that despite the way it sounds (completely stuck in the late 60's flower power pop genre) and despite the fact a good portion of these songs sound pretty much the same, the songwriting is where it counts above everything else.  \\"Hung Up on a Dream\\" is a GREAT song because of its spiritually haunting piano and background vocals.  I love this song a lot (and I mean a LOT- it's awesome).  The main verse melody is really terrific as well.  Just a great song.    It's hard to pick my next favorite so let's say it's a tie between the brilliant chorus in \\"Care of Cell 44\\" and the fantastic vocal melody in \\"I Want Her She Wants Me\\" (which resembles the Hollies as well).    A song like \\"Brief Candles\\" almost sounds devastating because of its melodic chorus and atmosphere, and \\"Changes\\" is neat because of the way it keeps alternating between two highly melodic vocal melodies.   \\"Butcher's Tale\\" is another favorite.  I actually forgot all about this song until now... let's say it's my fourth favorite song here.    Other songs like \\"Beechwood Park\\" feels slightly weaker than the rest of the songs, but not a WHOLE lot- just a tad.      Overall, this is a must own for fans of pop/rock at its very best and most creative.  Just remember- if you think Odessey and Oracle is awesome and you have yet to hear any Beatles material, you WILL be in for an even BIGGER treat.

B003HTPHSQ|2.0|I ran across this release by pure accident. I was reviewing the Billboard charts(7-20-10)` when I noticed this disc was ranked 1#. I was floored needless to say! This actually proves a point of mine...most people are still ignorant to the Blues!  With all the great Blues coming out today how does a native New Yorker with no Blues foundation represented(ever) in her music, and puts out maybe 1 record every 5-6 years score a #1 ranked Blues record? I recall a few years back Robert Palmer(\\"addicted to Love\\") making a Blues record(\\"Drive\\") that was \\"heralded\\" by critics and fans alike...soon after he had a heart attack and died. I'm not wishing that same fate on Cyndi ,but to Those who assume they know the Blues should check out the Delmark and Living Blues websites to fully understand the Blues,then hopefully spend some cash purchasing a \\"real\\" Blues disc from a \\"working\\" Blues artist/band...Lauper is easy to love, but novelty can only go so far when compared with the authentic.
B0009PAVI2|5.0|I just bought this holder for my 2 Cokin ND filters (rectangular shape) and for my Circular Polarizer. I was reluctant getting this as I didn't know whether the NDs would fit, but they do (second one a little tight). It will however not fit a third rectangular filter. The pockets look protective and I like the fact that you can put it on your belt or hang it to your gear bag. Very happy with the buy.
B002VPE1XY|5.0|I used to carry my previous small cameras in a Timbuk2 iPod case that was old and understated. Nobody paid too much attention to it, which is what I really wanted. Right as I bought my Sony DSC-TX7 my case suddenly disappeared and I was left with no choice but to pick up a new one.<br /><br />Sony's obvious offerings are crazy. They either want too much money for their leather cases, or their cloth cases are not providing the functionality that I want. Tried to check out a local Target, they had at least 20 different designs, either these didn't fit my camera, or they did but they had a zipper, or the colors were too loud.<br /><br />Then I found this baby here, almost by accident. It is priced ridiculously low (over half of what I was expecting to pay for the ugly cases I saw at Target), it has the belt buckle I want and it doesn't use a zipper. According to the published dimensions it would be about 5mm shorter than what I would need for my Sony DSC-TX7 but I was hoping that between the flexibility of the leather and maybe manufacturing tolerances it wouldn't be an issue.<br /><br />It wasn't: the case fits my camera like a glove. It is soft black leather on the outside, and it is lined in suede. It has a small pocket inside that can be used to hold a memory card or that kind of thing. My camera is much thinner than the space available, but due to its construction the case still fits snugly and the camera doesn't bounce inside. I have no idea how long the clasp is going to last, but the leather itself looks like it is going to age nicely, it is a bit softer than what I would expect for a wallet.<br /><br />The belt loop is not fixed, it uses velcro on its bottom so you can hook it to your belt without having to unbuckle it.
0563214546|4.0|It's a shame that the main review from the 'Publishers Weekly' failed to see the point illustrated by the Amazon reviewers. The lack of Balsamic vinegar might glare out of the page from those with cooking experience, but the main reader of this publication is supposed to be someone with little or no experience. Afterall, a huge amount of people have absolutely no idea how to cook anything at all. This book does not expect you to know anything, so it explains everything in depth.<br /><br />Personally, I look back fondly at this book as it was given to me by my mother and taught me so many of the basics in cooking. It might hail from Great Britain, but cooking is universal and her simple techniques enable even the complete novice to create delicious meals without fuss. Her clear writing and tried and tested recipes help you to turn out success time after time. Of course, the more experienced cook can use her recipes, too, perhaps using other beloved ingredients to make things a bit more up to date...<br /><br />Don't forget the original edition of this book was published in the 1970's and food-fashion has moved a along since then. This edition is the 1992 version and it lacks the vibrantly entertaining writing style of more modern cookery writers, but if you follow Delia's recipes to the letter, you will have success every single time and wow your friends the next time you cook!
1423113381|4.0|This is the first book in the Kane Chronicles by Rick Riordan.  This series is set to be a trilogy; with the next book released in 2011 and the final book released in 2012.  I absolutely loved Riordan's series Percy Jackson and the Olympians; so I was excited to read this one.  I actually listened to this on audio book so I have a couple of comments about that in the paragraph below (skip this if you have it in paper format).  This was a great book and I think fans of Percy Jackson will find a lot to like here.<br /><br />The audio book was interesting.  They had two readers one who read Carter's part and one who read Sadie's part.  The person who read Carter's part sounded almost exactly like Percy Jackson.  The person who read Sadie's part tended to sound a bit shrill at points in the book.  Overall the audio was well done but the shrillness of the girl's voice got to be a bit much at times.<br /><br />The story involves two of the Kane siblings, Carter and Sadie.  They are the children of Julius Kane and have been raised separate for most of their lives because of a legal battle that Julius lost after his wife died (Carter and Sadie's mom).  In this book they are drawn into a scheme by their father involving the Rosetta Stone and a number of Egyptian gods.  Things go horribly wrong though and when their Uncle Amos comes to rescue them; Carter and Sadie are drawn into a world of Egyptian Gods and Magicians that is more dangerous than anything they have ever encountered.  Will they be able to save their father?  Will they be able to save the world?<br /><br />If you liked the Percy Jackson series you will like this book.  Riordan does an excellent job of creating believable characters that are easy to relate too.  Carter and Sadie are just your every day kids but with a twist.  Riordan manages to add history and depth to all of the characters.  My favorite part about Riordan's writing is his ability to inject humor into his stories no matter how crazy the adventure and danger gets.<br /><br />Carter is the more serious character in this story and Sadie is the one that is spunky with a lot of sarcasm.  Between Sadie and Sadie's protector (the Goddess of Cats, Bast) you get a lot of laughs throughout this book.  The pace was great; the characters are thrust from one adventure to the next and you are constantly on the edge of your seat wondering what will be thrown at them next.<br /><br />Of course there is a lot of Egyptian mythology in here and Riordan has again done his homework.  I don't know as much about Egyptian mythology as Greek mythology; but what I do know coincided with the facts Riordan presents and there was a lot for me to learn too!<br /><br />My only complaint with this book is that well...it is definitely a Riordan book.  It echoes a lot of the same themes and feelings that we saw in Percy Jackson and the Olympians.  You have all the dealing with Gods, the kids missing parental figures, and kids dealing with budding power.  The writing style is nearly identical and Riordan is absolutely writing for the same audience he was writing for in his Percy Jackson series.  Don't get me wrong most of the book is very unique and different; but I couldn't help feeling like some of this ground was covered in Percy Jackson.  Comparison to the Percy Jackson series is inevitable, and while I loved that series, I was hoping that Riordan's next series would be something super special.  And The Red Pyramid is entertaining and special, just not all that different from what we've read before.<br /><br />Overall this is a great read.  If you liked the Percy Jackson series you will enjoy this one.  It took me a bit to get into the story but I imagine as the series develops I will get very attached to these characters, just like I got attached to the ones in the Percy Jackson series.  If you are interested in reading more great books about Egyptian mythology check out the [[ASIN:0618999760 Theodosia and the Serpents of Chaos]] booksby R.L. LaFevers.
1577314808|1.0|This book will only lead you to pain and more suffering as his philosophy is psychologically unsustainable. He talks about not reacting to content. If someone raped and murdered his family would he just accept it saying \\"oh there is only one moment and everything is wonderful\\" I'd hope not but it appears as though he would. I remember in an interview of him where he said he never feels sad. I also remember reading in his book that humanity is in a time of crisis and needs to \\"evolve\\" ... then Meister Eckhart why, if you really DO care about humanity are you charging people for your books instead of giving' them out to everyone??? hmm. oh no he couldn't do that. how would he afford his expensive condo and nice infinti?!? He even charges people ridiculous amounts to attend his seminars. Everything about this book screams cult and authoritarian. He wants you to stop your thoughts and become an apathetic emotionless flower who is in a constant state of sedation...why? so you can buy all his books and videos. I mean come on!!! he has hundreds of merchandise items on this site and he's even endorsed by Oprah!<br />Reading this book is like reading the word \\"Now\\" and \\"ego\\" \\"stop your mind\\" 5000 times. It is the most redundant mess of brainwashing I have ever read. I'm sorry, but this book is just dangerous. He talks about how we should forget our past and then in the first chapter goes into a whole scenario about his past. Oh but wait, one night he magically woke up and was enlightened. If anything, that's just offensive to the people who actually have spent years working to attain enlightenment through \\"AUTHENTIC\\" practices. He is extremely condescending and makes you feel bad about yourself and your...thoughts. If you do not want to be left with no emotions/thoughts/aspirations/goals then I suggest you don't order this book. Just because Oprah endorses him doesn't make it right.

But please do not be fooled just because oprah sells him on her show to make her billions. How does he know what my life's purpose is? This book is for people who are vulnerable and unstable...and he recognizes that. He is taking advantage of people who can't see through the B.S and making a profit from it. It's funny when you see people defend him, because they sound EXACTLY like him. Using the same phrases and words as him which is another sign of CULT behavior. In a cult there is usually someone running it. He tells you how to think and what to believe (brainwashing) tells you that your mind is insufficient (brainwashing) then takes your money. But people will always defend him because they've given themselves up to him. Just be aware people!
B00005MNP7|4.0|I recently gave Blondie's fourth album another chance after staying away from it for nearly 30 years.<br /><br />For some reason, \\"Eat to the Beat' has a grittier, grimy, dirty inner-city feel to it that \\"Parallel Lines\\" and the previous two albums did not. I also found the production much louder overall on several of the songs.<br /><br />\\"Dreaming\\" the opening number/first single (reached #5 in the local Toronto markets in November 1979) is Clem Burke's show all the way. Never has his drumming been more wonderfully frenetic than on this song right here. Debbie's vocals are somewhat melancholy despite the upbeat tempo.<br /><br />\\"The Hardest Part\\" is an interesting mix of funk meets hard rock. Sections of this one swing in a way that is reminiscent of \\"Heart of Glass\\", until the song immediately switches back to a pounding hammer-like beat.<br /><br />The somewhat mournful \\"Union City Blue\\" is another memorable track. It's got a nice melody that will stick in your head.<br /><br />Debbie's forlorn vocals and the depressing lyrics make \\"Shayla\\" better then average. By the time we get to \\"Shayla\\" the album seems as though it's becoming a tribute to the lower working class.<br /><br />So much so, that when the rousing title track comes barreling along, it catches the listener off-guard a bit. Even with a harmonica solo (!), \\"Eat to the Beat\\" manages to be one of the best tracks here, though Debbie's hyper vocals are sometimes unintelligible. What we are able to understand are some of Blondie's typically great tongue-in-cheek lyrics. This song has gotten better with age.<br /><br />Burke's purposely tentative drumming opens \\"Accidents Never Happen\\", which is slightly better than average. The vocals and slightly eerie arrangement don't necessary make one believe the title when Debbie sings it.<br /><br />\\"Die Young, Stay Pretty\\" opened Side Two on the LP, and it lacks the dramatic intensity that made \\"11:59\\" so fantastic as the beginning of Act II on \\"Lines\\". \\"Die\\" is just an average track, though it's slightly-reggae feel foreshadows what the band would be doing a year later on \\"The Tide is High\\".<br /><br />\\"Slow Motion\\" has a '60s Motown feel, (they even rip off The Supremes' Florence Ballard's memorable \\"Stop!\\") but is not very noteworthy otherwise; another average song.<br /><br />The swishy \\"Heart of Glass\\" rhythm that popped up in certain sections of \\"The Hardest Part\\" dominates the hypnotic \\"Atomic\\". This should have been a bigger hit than it was, barely cracking the Top 40. It DID however reach #1 in the U.K. in 1980. A remix even appeared on TV's \\"Queer as Folk\\" in the early 2000's. The song's disco overtones mixed with the ominous guitar and Debbie's lower delivery of the title make this one of \\"Beat's\\" best tunes. Just don't listen to it while driving with the windshield wipers on, because the combination will put you in a trance.<br /><br />Next is the appropriately-titled \\"Sound-a-Sleep\\", the dullest thing Blondie ever recorded. It's not that the band doesn't have the capacity to pull off slow material--\\"In the Flesh\\" was wonderful--it's just this one has no redeemable qualities, in my opinion.<br /><br />If \\"Sound-a-Sleep\\" is the lullabye, then \\"Victor\\" is the terrifying nightmare. With Debbie's tortured screams, and the band's scary chants reminiscent of those evil Wicked Witch's castle guards from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", \\"Victor\\" is certainly the freakiest track here. It certainly caught me off-guard in 1980 when I first heard it. If Blondie had begun making records 10 years earlier, something like this would not seemed out-of-place in \\"The Conqueror Worm/Witchfinder General\\". As disturbing as I originally found this at age 11, I actually think it's one of the more enjoyable tracks now. A song like this would have been right at home on Alice Cooper's \\"Killer\\" LP.<br /><br />The album closer is \\"Living in the Real World\\", an upbeat number, though nowhere near as great as the title song.<br /><br />We get four bonus tracks which include a live version of \\"Die Young, Stay Pretty\\" (nothing special though Debbie's comment to the audience at the start is cute), a cover of the Temptations' \\"Seven Rooms of Gloom\\" (which Pat Benatar did much better in 1985), a cover of Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\", and a live version of Bowie's \\"Heroes\\". These last two are the best of the bonus material.<br /><br />After the brilliance of \\"Parallel Lines\\", I found \\"Eat to the Beat\\" to be a bit of of a let-down. \\"Blondie\\" and \\"Plastic Letters\\" deserved the praise and popularity more than this album did.<br /><br />Many of the songs on \\"Eat To The Beat\\" lack the likeability factor that graced most of the selections on \\"Parallel Lines\\". The band seems to project an angry and harsher image on this record. More importantly, many of the songs just aren't as good. As a result, I never embraced this album the way I did the one that preceded it.<br /><br />Still, this is an essential chapter in Blondie history, and anyone who's enjoyed their first three releases should still get this one, if nothing else for \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Atomic\\", \\"Eat to the Beat\\" \\"Victor\\" and to hear the percussion God that is Clem Burke.acks which include a live version of \\"Die Young, Stay Pretty\\" (nothing special though Debbie's comment to the audience at the start is cute), a cover of the Temptations' \\"Seven Rooms of Gloom\\" (which Pat Benatar did much better in 1985), a cover of Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\", and a live version of Bowie's \\"Heroes\\".

B001TOD92C|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's \\"The Wrestler\\" is not only Mickey Rourke's best performance, it is also the director's best film to date--which means something if one looks back on the one time obscure masterpiece \\"Pi\\" and the gruelling exploration of drug addicton \\"Requiem For A Dream\\".<br /><br />Rourke plays burnt out, washed up wrestler \\"Randy the Ram\\" who is so addicted to the adrenaline high of professional wrestling--which actually takes more of a toll on the men involved than the deceptive cartoonish appearance of the sport would suggest--and takes on a tour of a lonely hell of has beens, crippled veterans of the ring, and the cruel lengths to which men will go to propagate the illusion of machismo for the viewing pleasure of pot bellied men and women who view them as invincible demi-gods of some sort.<br /><br />Randy is a man who has spent his life pleasing the Abstract Other--millions of Americans who rode on the high hog of the 1980's until that decade graciously ended and brought the authenticity of Nirvana or as Randy says in one of his more \\"insensitive\\" moments about the change in decade and atmosphere: \\"Then that Cobain p*ssy had to come and ruin everything!\\" In the ring he is a flaming giant, recalling the \\"Rockers\\" group I remember from watching Professional Wrestling as a child with neon green under arm straps, a warlike viking pair of \\"shorts\\", and greasy blonde hair which he continually tosses about in an arrogance which is all too easily seen through as the insecurity of a basically nice guy who is completely lost in the real world.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei plays his \\"partner\\", sort of, an aging stripper who like Randy has lost the balance between reality and illusion.  While her real name is Pam her \\"strip name\\" is Cassidy.  These two broken human beings are straight out of a Bukowski poem, only with a bit more hope: watch for the interesting commentary on \\"The Passion of The Christ\\" as Tomei recites a passage from Isaiah and looks at Randy, realizing he is also a sort of Christlike figure, even willing to get a staple gun put in his chest by a young man just starting out to give him his name in the sport.  He just wants to make people happy and goes about doing it in all the wrong ways.  The cinematography gives the feel of lower-middle class New Jersey with a stinking authenticity: after suffering a heart attack, Randy is forced to take a good look at his life and is no longer able to wrestle.  With mortality looming he makes an attempt to reconcile with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), who he simply never had time for during his period in the limelight.<br /><br />Wood gives perhaps the weakest performance in what is otherwise a nearly perfect film.  She pouts so much, looks so drawn and pale that one gets the impression she is trying to communicate the trauma of abandonment by her father a little too much.  And it's a little too perfect within terms of the plotline that she is a lesbian with an African American girlfriend: gee, could that have something to do with her rebellion against her Alphamale father and his cult of manly manliness?  This is the only weakness in the movie.<br /><br />The ending is not suicide.  It is not just despair on Ram's part or a desire to die, as many seem to believe.  With all his attempts at real human connection failed, he makes the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of his fans after delivering a speech which is really his epitaph.  He undergoes (I have no doubt Aronofsky was studying Gibson's technique on \\"The Passion\\" while making this film) gruelling physical suffering, and his physical prowess is just enough to please his fans as he suffers a massive heart attack in act of penance and passion.  Simply an incredible movie which words cannot describe.

B002ZG98LO|4.0|PREDATORS    It has been a long time since an actual Predator movie as been made and I have to say that I am truly happy another did indeed come along. Sure we had two AVP films come out but those were not straight Predator films, and to be honest those had the potential to be so much more. Don't get me wrong I didn't hate any of them but they could have been better. So when I heard Robert Rodriguez was involved with the next Predator film I was extremely excited. I found out later he was just producing the film based on a story he wrote many years ago, still I knew it would be good.    So when the film finally was released in theaters we all gathered up and went to see it, by we I mean me, my girl, my bro, and one of my best friends. We waited a week or so after the opening release due to so other things going on but still we made it to the movies. So we got there 30 minutes early or so as to get good seats and declined buying any drinks. We didn't get any drinks because it was apparent that these fountain drinks were imported from only the finest of lands, squeezed from the supple [well they were just insanely expensive, principle alone forbid me from tasting it's sweet sugary taste]. So we made our way into the last door on the left to watch what we knew would be great.    If you do not know by now the film starts with people free falling and waking up doing so having no memory of how they got there. After making their way to the ground, some harder than others, they do not know who to trust. But the overwhelming sense that something is very wrong leads them to form an uneasy alliance with each other, if only for the moment. There is about eight of them and each coming from a different area, country, and background, or so it seems. It may turn out to be that all of these people are more alike than they think. How so you may ask, well it is because all of them are killers, or should we say predators back where they come from. The best of the best when it comes tokilling on Planet Earth, well all but one it seems. And speaking of Planet Erath we may or may not be on our own planet as we take this ride with these people.    Still the title says it all and even a person who is not a fan of these films knows that the movie is about an alien creature who is the ultimate hunter. A creature so deadly not even Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura could survive when pitted against it; sure some have defeated it but look at that statement. Some have defeated it, as in a predator but who can survive multiple of the greatest killer known to the universe. Even more threatening is that we learn the Predator we have always feared is actually the smaller of two different species of the creature, YIKES. But it is all a game in this film and I mean that in the sense that we are the game, along with various other creatures from different worlds. It also seems that these monsters have been doing this forever, so let the games begin.    The people in this film are what some would say cliché characters, the military guys, the mercenaries, the yakuza guy and such. The thing is these people actually do exist and whether the script could fully develop them or not is were the problem is. Writers Michael Finch and Alex Litvak in my opinion kept the film on the right path along with director Nimród Antal moving it along. Sure the characters could have been developed more but hey this is a Predator movie after all, aren't we here to see people get hunted and then slaughtered. So I can forgive any shortcoming the script may have had, I mean come on I have been waiting for a Predator film since the second one.    As far as our actors go I must say from the jump I was extremely excited to see MMA legend Oleg Taktarov in this film. And just like I thought he did an amazing job here, I mean who better to take on a Predator. Adrien Brody is our lead here and pulls the role off well and in my eyes was very believable in the role, even beefed up a little bit. Topher Grace was a surprise here and much like his character seemed out of place, but let me assure you he does an excellent job in this film. Alice Braga is our only female here and she does not disappoint, even showing up the boys in this film at times. I mean her character does, all of the performances are great. Walton Goggins is a scene stealer for sure and gives the film a little more comedic moments. Danny Trejo is here as well although it would have been cool to see him get more time on screen. Louis Ozawa Changchien is great as the Yakuza character in this film, Mahershalalhashbaz Ali is great and menacing looking in this, and of course the surprise of the film Laurence Fishburne all give great performances as well.    I should also note that there are three other actors in this film Derek Mears playing our classic Predator, Carey Jones as the tracker Predator, and Brian Steele as the berserker predator. Now with that out the way I can say that the film really does pay respect to the other Predator films and does not make them look weak like the first AVP did. One moment I particularly love involves the Yakuza character up against a Predator one on one. Now I mention this because some people have been saying a Predator would not have a blade battle with a person, they would just kill them and move on. I have to disagree with that on all fronts; I know a Predator would do hand to hand, blade to blade, or gun to gun with a singular opponent. We have to remember that Predators or prideful in their hunting skills and their ability to defeat any prey in any form of combat. Let me just say that this part of the film is one of my favorites.    Now like I said before there are some flaws and that is mostly with the script but you can over look them just by looking at the great lay out of the new planet, especially when they realize they are not on Earth, that shot is amazing. Also the new creatures that we get a peek at in this film are great, such as the dog like creaturesthe Predators use in this film. The film really is an entertaining ride from start to finish and shows the potential the new Predators films have if the continue with a sequel. The film was a great way to spend that night and I did not feel bad about paying for every one to go see it. I thought the movie was worth the money I spent, to me there is nothing better than watching a movie with your closest friends around you. It not only adds to the atmosphere in the room but it makes the viewing experience a little more fun.

B0032FPVKE|3.0|I bought this bag for my Canon Vixia HF M31 camcorder based on commets other people made about the recommended Canon bag being way too big.  The AmazonBasics Camcorder Bag with Shoulder Strap is well-made with a nice, soft interior.  The build quality is fine and I like the concept of the belt loops positioned so that you can open the bag toward you, eliminating the fear that the camera will fall out.  (This kind of makes it look like a fanny pack and I believe those went out of style back in the... uh, were fanny packs ever in style?)    Nonetheless, the bag is not very useful for my camcorder.  The main compartment is too big for the camera without the divider.  The picture of the Canon camcorder sitting horizontally in the bag is a little deceptive as the main compartment is too deep for it to rest up that high by itself.  If you use the divider, the camera fits fine (vertically), but the rest of the compartment isn't nearly big enough for all the necessary accessories.  Given that the batteries on these new camcorders only last an hour or so, you really need to pack the power cord (with the in-line power converter similar to those found on laptop power cords).  The internal pockets are big enough for a memory card or a small cleaning cloth or a couple of AA batteries, but nothing else.  I did eventually jam everything into the main compartment, but I nearly had to sit on it to get it closed.    The good news is that I still had an old Case Logic bag, the TBC-5, which I had been using for an old still shot camera.  If you look that one up on Amazon, there is a picture of it with a camcorder (horizontal) and a point-and-shoot (vertical).  I put my new camcorder in there vertically where the point-and-shoot is in the picture and the cords and accessories where the camcorder is shown.  It fits like a glove!  It was almost like it was made for the camera.  I could put in everything that came in the box with the camera except the CD-ROMs and the instruction manual.  Better still, the old still shot camera I had in there fit great with all its accessories in the AmazonBasics bag, so after a little switcheroo, I've got a perfect bag for each.    The upshot: the AmazonBasics bag is ok, but the Case Logic TBC-5 is perfect for my camcorder.  They are both the same height and the TBC-5 is only a few inches longer.  You get a lot more effective space for only a slight increase in size.  Unfortunately, it looks like Amazon is not currently stocking the TBC-5, but another bag linked from that page, the Tamrac 5522, looks similar.  I think you would have to give up the belt loops, though.

This Caucasian woman from the UK is the perfect example of not judging a book by its cover. I'm convinced now that everyone has \\"SOUL.\\" You just have to find it. And boy, did she find it!!!

B0036S4CTS|5.0|The book is called One Day (they just started filming the movie last week with Anne Hathaway). It's from a UK author and it tells the story of Dexter and Emma, friends who meet on the day of their college graduation in 1988 and the subsequent on and off again affair/friendship over the following 20 years. The literary device used to tell their story somewhat chronological each chapter being a new year but the same day.  So where will they be on this one day next year? And the year after that? And every year that follows? Twenty years, two people.  What was good about it (to me) is while it is slightly \\"chick-lit\\"ish, it also has a very male voice (sort of like a Nick Hornby book) from the perspective of Dexter's character (also Emma is not your typical chick-lit heroine). I think it resonated too because our protagonists are/were basically my age and going through the same things I did over the past 20 years in the same decades I did (80's, 90's).  It's really one of the best books I've read in a long time, very funny, very honest and truly beguiling.
030745455X|1.0|Insufferably poor storytelling.  Boring plot that only gets started 60% of the way through.  Perhaps the most disappointing book I've ever finished reading.<br /><br />Larsson seems more passionate obsessively describing what characters purchase and how often they prepare coffee than actually writing a book.  Overall, an intolerably horrid follow-up to what was a great and enjoyable first book.<br /><br />Also, what is this guy's deal toward women, exactly?  Although folks like to tout the Tattoo series as a pro-feminist revelation, it comes across more as Larsson having an excuse to abuse female characters for hundreds of unnecessary pages.  Regardless of how you view him, his perspective is muddled, and comes across like a poor man's version of Michael Moore--he's struggling with a vitally important issue that demands more focus than it has traditionally been given, but doesn't have the faintest clue what his own opinion is, how it should be resolved, or even how best to portray it.  Just because someone brings up a brutally horrid topic does not mean he's informed about it, has a strong stance on it, or is even introducing it for any other purpose than to catch your attention.<br /><br />Also, the intros where he describes basic algebra are a needless, disconnected way of trying to show off what little knowledge he has about the topic.  WTF?
0307474712|5.0|I know that this book has gotten a lot of hype this summer, and I believe it also is already slated to become a movie, so I was curious whether it would hold up. I have to say that it does! I could barely put this book down, and read it each night before bed. One Day is the story of two people - Em and Dex, Dex and Em - and their relationship. Each chapter covers one day, July 15, each year, and explores where each person is in his/her life, and his/her relationship to the other person. Sometimes, they are together. Sometimes, they aren't. But over ups and downs, arguments and flirtations, Emma and Dexter are drawn to each other.<br /><br />First, I really loved the idea of this book, as it seemed pretty original and definitely kept the story moving. The writing is also excellent. I loved how Nicholls circles back to references to jokes or phrases later in the book. It was very smartly executed. This book was intelligent, funny, entertaining, touching, and overall, just a great read. I think men and women would both enjoy it, and I'm looking forward to the movie. I'm hoping they find some great British actors for this. It's definitely going to be interesting to see how they follow one couple through time! I can see myself reading this book again and definitely recommending it to friends and family.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Oh for heavens sake folks-for those that said the show has been sunk, I respect your opinion, but mine is in opposition. No actor could ever be too young to play the Doctor since the regeneration could take on any age or visage of the Doctor's race- the Timelords. Doctor Who has been silly sometimes let's face facts. But some of the greatest shows are the ones where in spite of lame sets, the actors who play all the characters-the Doctor included, just work well together. Especially in the case of Patrick and Wendy and Frazer. Those three were incredible together. I think that Rory and Amy and the Matt reached similar moments this last season. Rory like Jamie is totally out of his element, Amy like Wendy seems to be on the same wavelength as the Doctor. Some fun things happen. I really enjoyed most of the episodes. There were some instances where the laws of all things Who were bent, but that is the point of regeneration, \\"change my dear and not a moment too soon.\\" In the final episode it was revealed that things were erased but not really. I hope that if someone asks Steven that ? about if the end was to erase the whole season from ever happening he would say no. And the way it ended was a roller coaster ride. I enjoyed it. I'm sorry that others did not. I hope you will keep watching and see if the next season will tickle you.
1401308201|4.0|Meant to be a companion to the musical based on the original novel of Wicked by Gregory Maguire, Wicked: The Grimmerie is a comprehensive behind-the-scenes view of the musical from the book to Broadway. It's titled The Grimmerie after the magical book from both the novel and musical that Elphaba(the Wicked Witch of the West)uses.<br /><br />The book covers the timeline leading from the original Wizard Of Oz novel to Wicked, plus how it went from being a screenplay for a proposed movie(before the one they're planning on doing now)to instead a musical extravaganza. Also included is the history of the choosing of the staff and cast, the music by Stephan Schwartz, taking the show on the road, plus a breakdown of the music numbers and some of their lyrics. The best is the detail that goes into describing the characters and how the actors perform them, how the sets and costumes are designed, and a look at the entire story as a whole(warning: spoilers included!).<br /><br />There's a really distinct feel given to this large hardcover. It's modeled to look slightly like the actual Grimmerie from the book on the outside, and the interior gives the impression of an ancient tome mixed in with a turn-of-the-century publication. There's some wonderful art by W.W. Denslow and John R. Neil from the original Oz books, along with great photograps from the show and its production. I'd recommend this as a collectors item or gift mainly for anyone who has already seen the musical.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I couldn't wait ton read part.2, I loved it. It gives you so much insight into why Salander is the way she is. I highly recommend the series. The only hard part is saying goodbye to to the characters. I heard they are making an American version of the movie, such a shame. If you get a chance watch the Swedish one, with English subtitles. The actress is amazing. In fact she was exactly the way I pictured her. I haven't been excited about a series like this before. The last book I couldn't wait to read was the follow up by the author who wrote The Kite Runner and they weren't a series, but I couldn't wait to read A Thousand Splendid Suns. This series is not my normal type of read but I loved it. My book club picked the first one. There were only two of us (out of 8) that loved it. Well happy reading. You'll read through it quickly and then the third one is out and a must.  I wonder how the author died? He died right after he submitted all three books.
1423101472|5.0|After the usual cliffhanger of a book that precedes the finale, I was very eager to read The Last Olympian (Book 5). What I read was above and beyond any book in the series and an absolute fantastic way to finish it out. As Battle of the Labyrinth set up previously, the final showdown between the Olympians and Kronos draws dangerously close to being a reality. This is what Percy and all the other demigods in camp have been training for their entire lives, but will it be enough or in time to stop the Titan army? As the book opens, we learn Kronos is back and getting stronger than ever in the body of Luke and with each traitor that crosses over, helps him gain a stronger foothold in the mortal world again.<br /><br />As The Last Olympian opens, preparations from Camp Half-Blood against the Titan Lord and his army are underway. However, Percy and company have a bit more to worry about than just Kronos himself. They must also figure out a way to help the Gods of Olympus defeat the literal \\"Father of all monsters\\" in Typhon, who was accidentally released when Percy nearly destroyed Mount St. Helens the previous summer. As Typhon walks again, he sets his sights on now rampaging in a path of destruction towards New York City where there will be no stopping him if he reaches The Summit of Olympus.<br /><br />The search for the upper hand takes Percy on a very interesting journey, of which includes a very interesting visit to the mother of Luke in order to find anything that would explain just why Luke became who he became and why Luke would ever serve someone like Kronos. What will Percy learn from this meeting? What could the mother of Luke have to offer Percy that would help when it matters the most? Riordan crafts the answers to these questions very nicely and does an excellent job of not giving them away until the very end. With that said, The Last Olympian is certainly not without its fair share of surprises and \\"ah ha!\\" moments. Percy's story is complimented very well by the lovable characters of Grover and Annabeth but equally as well by characters like Nico where you're never sure what side they're on. Readers up to this point will be very intrigued after they see what Rachel's role is towards the end as well. It ends up making perfect sense for her, but you don't quite realize what her true potential is until the last few pages.<br /><br />I wasn't ready to give any book in the series 5 stars so far, but this one truly won me over. I don't like to give a lot of books 5 stars unless they really earn them and this book definitely did that. Everything seemed to work just right with The Last Olympian. From the pacing to the action scenes to the character development, it all just fit nicely. Even though it's a series primarily aimed at young adults, the humor and knowledge you gain of mythology throughout this book and this series is truly refreshing to see for any age. Whether you're looking for a good summer read or a good summer read that teaches you something in the process, don't make the mistake of missing out on this series!<br /><br />-Travis S.characters of Grover and Annabeth but equally as well by characters like Nico where you're never sure what side they're on.

B001KOFH2G|4.0|I was dying to get more Firefly, and although I still think the series was the cat's meow, the movie fell short of my expectations.  It felt like it was 4 years worth of series action/reveals jam packed into one film.  It was far darker than the series, without the witty reparte that made the series so phenomenal.      It was nice having some closure, but the cost was a loss of the greatness.
B003GEDLW6|5.0|simply put, this album takes the best of the hard hitting beats of hold your colour and the more varied approach of in silico, and improves on them both for what i consider to be the best yet.  the only track i'm not fond of is track 6 (under the waves), but that's one out of fifteen  i won't get into technical details, i just know i like what i'm hearing, and if you're a fan of pendulum, i doubt your experience would be any different
B002Q9VPFM|2.0|Though some think they were cheated by the Theatrical release, the best version this is not. It is too long, disjointed, annoying, and prone to itchy fingers on the ffwd button. The intermediate Director's Cut seems to be the best version. Enough of the cut scenes to fill in the gaps, and extraneous material thoughtfully excised.  I am not a fan of G. Butler, and the animated inserts did nothing but kill the momentum of the story, leaving the audience searching for \\"meaning\\" in the garbled diction and blurry vocalizations. (I found myself searching for the transitions, jumping too far past the boring animated sections and the newsstand banter.)  \\"Watchmen\\" is a complex, convoluted and well textured movie, and it often requires multiple viewings to grasp it all. Slogging repeatedly through 3 plus hours becomes more a chore than entertainment. Ultimate cut in length, but not ultimate in entertainment.  This is definitely a case of \\"Goldilocks\\" where the middle version is just right.
0061914177|4.0|I read most of the 1-star reviews to measure the response of those who hate the book.  I understand the sentiments of those who disparage the work, but they expected too much.  For me, this book delivers just what I anticipated:  An earnest appeal to embrace social media as a marketing platform combined with enough autobiography to get a picture of Gary himself.  The endless enthusiasm and point-by-point suggestions are as good as any business tome to energize and provoke the reader.  For the cost of an inexpensive bottle of wine, you get an entertaining, inspirational read.  Is that not worth a slice of your time?  Sure it is!
030745455X|4.0|Stieg Larsson is a writer with a social agenda. In The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (DRAGON TATTOO), he turns his lens to corporate corruption and sexual violence against women. In The Girl Who Played with Fire (FIRE), he focuses on the sex trade, and all of the corrupt journalists, police officers, and lawyers who collude with the thugs who trade in the trafficking of Eastern European women for sex. DRAGON TATTOO introduced us to a host of complex, fascinating characters--Lisbeth Salander, Mikael Blomkvist, Erika Berger, the staff of Millennium magazine, Nils Bjurman, Dragan Armansky, Holger Palmgren, and Mimmi--who are absolutely central to the plot of FIRE as well. In FIRE, crimes that surround the sex trade, including the murders of Bjurman, and two others, are woven into Salander's personal story and provide the key to her mysterious past. Salander is suspected of commiting these murders and yet readers know--or at least hope--that she is innocent. Involved, yes, but we must believe that she is somehow innocent. So, taking our cue from many of Larsson character, we put on the coffee, and delve into this wonderfully plotted thriller.<br /><br />The novel opens with a genius prologue. In it, we read of a young Salander who is being held captive by a malicious man who by all appearances seems to be emotionally and sexually abusing her, and subjecting her to sadistic practices and solitary confinement. Since the novel--and the three murders it needs to solve--revolves around the sex trade, I immediately assumed that Salander's mysterious past must have had some connection with the sex trade and that she herself possibly was one of the unlucky girls who was a victim of the trade.<br /><br />Through a clever plot twist, Larsson upends the assumptions that readers may have made in the prologue. It's not a sadistic sex offender or rapist like Nils Bjurman who is holding Salander captive, but (without giving it away) something much more mundane. So, the sadistic torture chamber a la Martin Vanger gives way to something more ordinary, which then allows Larsson to launch a biting social critique of some of the most commonplace social institutions.<br /><br />The plot of FIRE is complex, with a veritable menagerie of characters, and keeping them straight can be sometimes confusing. Milennium magazine is slated to publish a freelance writer's story on the sex trade (based on said writer's girlfriend's doctoral dissertation) when the two, shortly after a visit from Salander, are found murdered in their apartment. Not only this, but Nils Bjurman is found murdered in his apartment on the same night. Salander is pinned for the murders, and hides out from the authorities, using her amazing abilities to survey the scene through her laptop. The police launch an investigation and we meet a host of interesting detectives. Meanwhile, Blomkvist and Dragan Armansky, both of whom Salander has all but ignored for the past two years, both believe Salander is innocent and each investigates the crime. Keeping the threads of each investigation separate is a challenge for this reader.<br /><br />FIRE is different from DRAGON TATTOO in that it focuses mostly on the character of Lisbeth Salander. The middle section is largely a police procedural. FIRE does not delve into the horrific depths that DRAGON TATTOO did. If there is horror in FIRE, it lies in a family's dark secrets rather than a sadist's torture chamber, and the cruelty of one family member to another.<br /><br />Parts of the novel seemed improbable, and even bordered on the absurd. For example, the characters of Paolo Roberto and \\"The Giant\\" Niedermann seemed either unlikely to exist at all, or unrealistically \\"played\\" by the author in service of the plot's action scenes. I also found Salander's tenacious rebound in the novel's conclusion unlikely at best. (I was rooting for her all the way, no doubt, but felt the scene was a bit too far fetched.) The novel frames each section with an epigraphdevoted to mathematical theorems. We discover that Salander is at work trying to solve Fermat's theorem. Yet what is the connection between Fermat's famous riddle and Salander's own personal quest to find resolution in her past? I read and reread the section, but for the life of me I cannot figure out how she solves the mathematical conundrum at the novel's conclusion.<br /><br />The novel introduces several elements that are not resolved at the end, but will presumably be taken care of in the third installation, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest: What will Ericka Berger's professional fate be? What will come of Milennium magazine? And what was the significance of the crime that Salander witnessed while staying on Grenada?<br /><br />In my opinion, Larsson does an amazing job of writing a perfectly plotted thriller with a social conscience. I really liked how FIRE, like DRAGON TATTOO, takes up the issue of violence against women. There was surprisingly little said about the actual sex trade, but the novel did make unexpected forays into GLBT issues by introducing lesbian or bisexual characters, and showing the overwhelming prejudices that still exist on behalf of the police investigators and the media, who are quick to deploy vicious stereotypes. Larsson has created a gem in the character of Lisbeth Salander. I'm sure that readers of all political persuasions (and attitudes towards feminism and women's rights) will be rooting for this young woman who has been so victimized by male-dominated institutions and society's pervasive prejudices against women. (I guess that if the enlightened Scandinavian country of Sweden is still struggling with gender prejudice, then we all still are.)<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed FIRE, and could not put the book down until I had reached the conclusion. With that said, I felt that it did not live up to the heights achieved by DRAGON TATTOO, but I would imagine that it would be difficult to achieve such a literary feat twice in one's life.

B001LMU182|4.0|Before I go off reviewing this anime, I'll share my personal history with it, which dates back eight years ago.<br /><br />I remember staying up late at night and at the stroke of midnight, the date of July 15, 2002 just started (I wanted everyone to be asleep in my house).  I put a Streamline Pictures VHS copy of Akira into my VCR and had no idea what to expect out of it since I had virtually no experience with anime, with the exceptions of watching Pokemon from 1999-2000 (I'm not proud of this) and Gigantor back in 1992-93.  Since I never really watched any animated material of Akira's magnitude, I was overwhelmed by it and sat around the house in a complete daze for about a week.  It was also so impressive, it turned me on to the whole anime genre and even convinced me to pursue a career where I can put my drawing skills to work.  After watching Akira for the first time, I came out a changed teenage boy.  For a really long time, I considered Akira not only the pinnacle of animation, but also the pinnacle of cinema.  However, after the crash increase of my anime consumption in the last year that's nearly parallel to Stalin's crash industrialization of the USSR, and an all around more serious focus on film in general, I've noticed some flaws that keep this from being the masterpiece that many anime fans claim it as.<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />Akira is set in Neo-Tokyo circa 2019, 31 years after World War 3.  Underneath the gigantic, glowing skyscrapers and neon signs that dominate the metropolis, Neo-Tokyo is a cesspool of filth and crime. Bike gangs are constantly at war and people are constantly protesting the government's actions and a feeble economy.  During a biker battle, Tetsuo gets injured in a crash caused by a mysterious, blue-skinned boy.  Soon, his mentor and childhood friend, Kaneda, gets involved with a terrorist group trying to stop the government's dangerous experiments on these mysterious children.  Tetsuo soon gains unbelievably strong psychic powers and can possibly go mad with them.<br /><br />APPEARANCE<br /><br />One of Akira's best strengths is its visuals.  For an anime made in 1987, the animation is unbelievably smooth and the artwork has no shred of compromise in even the smallest details.  Over 300 colors of paint were used in the production of this anime and the scenes taking place at night are impressive in that so many shades were used to render the imagery instead of just using black and maybe one or two shades of blue, which was a common practice back then.  Even the most menial \\"extra\\" character will move to bring life to the environment.  There's even some flashy visual effects with the motorcycles' tail lights with a dragging illumination effect when they move quickly in the night.  Since Akira takes place in the fairly distant future, it's certainly looks like it concerning the architecture of the city and the technology of weapons, motorcycles, and other devices; the army even has nifty laser rifles that actually look like what would be realistic laser weapons instead of the laser weaponry we'd think of when watching the original Star Wars Trilogy.  However, I noticed that the characters in this anime absolutely reek of 80's fashion and cultural trends.  The best example of this would be the biker groupies since they look like fashionistas plucked right out of 1987.  Though admittedly, the 80's-looking characters do add some sort of nostalgic charm to this anime, that is if you're an 80's junkie like myself.  Akira was also the first anime to incorporate decent-looking computer effects into cel animation (Golgo 13 was technically the first, but those effects looked quite bad).  The computer effects are shown in the \\"mental growth\\" projector in the head scientist's lab, and they look fantastic since they don't look like blocks, but rather tye-dyed waves that perfectly fit the context of the technology employed in that particular scene.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />For me, the characters could use some significant tweaking, hence why the rating for this is faily low compared to, say, Battle Angel.  The only two really developed characters in this anime are Kaneda and Tetsuo.  This is so because they're the only two characters that we really sit down and get to know, so to speak.  Kaneda and Tetsuo both had to live as orphans throughout their lives.  Tetsuo was always a runt while Kaneda has had to act like the \\"big brother\\" and bail him out of trouble when needed.  When Tetsuo's goes mad with his psychic powers and takes it out on everyone, it feels completely understandable as to why he'd act like this given his rough upbringing.  That's really were the well-developed characters end because unfortunately, it feels like the rest of the cast was there just to keep the story flowing, which is a shame because these characters were well developed in the original Akira manga series (which I own).  Examples of half-baked characters would be Kay and the Colonel.  All we really know about Kay is that she's a terrorist trying to stop the government from destroying the city much like they did over 30 years ago, and that the Colonel is really cynical of the government's experiments on the \\"Numbers,\\" or the psychic children.  Sadly, some characters exist solely for extra \\"mature content.\\"  The best example would be Tetsuo's girlfriend, Kaori.  She seems to be there only for a rough topless scene and a grizzly fate, which is unfortunate since in the manga, she was really important in preserving some shreds of humanity within Tetsuo.  I honestly don't know why people quickly bash Doomed Megalopolis for its violence and sexual content but overlook that previously stated observation.<br /><br />THEMES<br /><br />This is where people have gone overboard in fabricating artificial claims to inflate the status of Akira. While there's certainly more intelligent content in this one than the typical Hollywood fare and to justify the intense focus on visuals, I feel it's underwhelming compared to superior anime titles like Grave of the Fireflies and Ghost in the Shell.  Lots of people have been saying that there's \\"really thought-provoking themes about Zen and Buddhism\\" and all that other jazz, but I have not seen anything in this anime to justify those particular claims.  However, it does have some thought-provoking elements about what life can be like if people attained massive powers, making them somewhat god-like.  This is almost exclusively elaborated upon when Kaneda and Kay get incarcerated for a failed break in to the government facility, where Kay is fed through one of the numbers about the energy that flows through life and to give some insight using an analogy with an amoeba having a human's power, which is somewhat like an analogy to a human having a god's power.<br /><br />MATURE CONTENT<br /><br />While not one of the most extreme anime titles I've seen in this area, this is certainly not an anime I'd let kids see.  Akira has a pretty significant amount of bloodshed, especially towards the beginning where a terrorist operative is gunned down by the army and blood just sprays everywhere.  As stated before, there's even an unsavory scene where enemy bikers sexually assault Kaori, rendering her topless and with a bloody nose.  Tetsuo's hallucinations are quite disturbing to watch, because some of them involve him falling through crumbling concrete and because of the fall's intense impact, his entrails just spill all over the ground, while he's desperately scooping them back into his belly.  Even some hallucinations aren't particularly violent, but are quite messed up because it's not everyday that you see a giant teddy bear, bunny rabbit, and toy car try to attack someone.  Towards the end of the movie, Tetsuo's body mutates into a giant cybernetic blob that looks like nothing within the confines of simple explanation, but all I can say is that it looks REALLY gross.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />Akira actually has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in an anime.  So much so, I actually got motivated to buy a CD copy of it (same with Ghost in the Shell and Doomed Megalopolis).  Geinoh Yamashirogumi did a fantastic job composing the music for Akira because he employs a huge variety of instruments such as keyboards, steel drums, and ethnic Japanese instruments to create heart-racing sounds beyond description.  The music creates a large variety of moods that perfectly fit the scenes they're used in.  There's creepy yet ponderous ambient keyboard passages to give the audience a feeling of dark uneasiness, such as when Tetsuo makes his way to the room where the Numbers reside. There's tracks that sound aggressive and bizarre, such as the music played when Tetsuo mutates into the giant blob.  Even if you're not a hardcore fan of Akira, you may want to get the soundtrack because on its own, it makes for great listening.<br /><br />ACTION SCENES<br /><br />Akira, being an action anime, delivers some pretty awesome action scenes.  This is probably the only anime where you see biker fight each other, psychic juggernauts fight other psychics, and psychic juggernauts fight arrogant punk biker leaders armed with laser rifles.  Seeing the opening where Kaneda's gang chases and fights the Clowns is still exciting today and for the most part, the two fights between Kaneda and Tetsuo towards the end still get my heart racing.  The only part I didn't like is that after the SOL gets destroyed, they had to throw in a completely pointless comedic bit where Kaneda has to run away from a bunch of falling debris that would be more appropriate in a Roadrunner short than a serious anime.  All in all, the action scenes are cool.<br /><br />OLD DUB VS NEW DUB<br /><br />If you don't know already, two English dubs exist for Akira.  One being created back in 1989 by Streamline Pictures, which most notably features Cam Clarke of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fame, and the other being made in 2001 by Pioneer, which notably features Johnny Yong Bosch of Power Rangers fame.  I consider myself extremely lucky to have watched Akira with the Streamline dub first because the Pioneer dub for it is absolutely deplorable.  Many people have slammed the Streamline dub for it's \\"cartoony\\" aesthetic and that the lines don't fit the original Japanese script.  I don't think these are solid points because while yes, the Pioneer dub has a translation closer to the original script, any respectable translator will tell you that quality translations aren't word-by-word, otherwise they'd be really boring.  To reinforce this point, there's a line in the Streamline dub where Kaneda says \\"Just when my coils were hitting the green line.\\"  In the new dub, he says \\"Just when my motor coils were heating up.\\"  The former has more character and sounds like something a hardcore biker would say in an English-speaking context, the latter sounds dull.  As for the previously-stated \\"cartoony\\" aspect to the Streamline dub, I don't really care because I loved the Ninja Turtles back in the early 90's, and that Cam Clarke gives Kaneda a much needed \\"arrogant punk\\" tone to his voice, and that the other cast in this dub feels just right for their roles.  However, in the Pioneer Dub, Bosch makes Kaneda sound like a whiny upper class kid in Burbank, completely sucking away any grittiness or coolness his character might have had; and that in general, Bosch has a terrible voice.  I even remember buying the \\"special edition\\" DVD about five days after first watching Akira and was ready to murder someone after hearing the new voice overs, so I sold it and bought an old Streamline VHS copy to introduce my friends to it until the Aussies got it right on DVD.  I know there's some old-time fans who loathe the Pioneer dub and I don't blame you.  If you guys have a regionless DVD player or a computer that can play DVDs from other regions, the Australian (Region 4) DVD of Akira has the Streamline dub on it with the remastered picture quality.  If you don't really care about dubs, I urge you to only watch this in Japanese, which is on all the DVDs and the Blu-ray releases.<br /><br />MY SUGGESTIONS<br /><br />Akira really could have been the masterpiece many people see it as.  Katsuhiro Otomo, if you're reading this right now, swish the following in your head and give it some deep consideration.  Please remake Akira into a four part OVA series with each installment being an hour long.  You can use the same story you wrote for the movie adaptation and even keep many of the plot points the same, but please use the extra allotted time to develop the characters much better and to flesh out the intellectual themes much better.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />Akira ISN'T the untouchable masterpiece that people claim it to be, but it's a good anime nonetheless, and if you like fairly intelligent action anime, then it'll probably sit comfortably in your collection. However, you're better off reading the Akira manga.  If you're just starting off with the anime genre, here's some masterful anime titles that make Akira pale in comparison to.<br /><br />Grave of the Fireflies<br />Spirited Away<br />Ghost in the Shell<br />Perfect Blue<br />Paprika<br />Millennium Actress<br />Neo-Tokyo<br />Doomed Megalopolis<br />Battle Angel<br />Shigurui:  Death Frenzycopy of it (same with Ghost in the Shell and Doomed Megalopolis).

I don't think these are solid points because while yes, the Pioneer dub has a translation closer to the original script, any respectable translator will tell you that quality translations aren't word-by-word, otherwise they'd be really boring.  To reinforce this point, there's a line in the Streamline dub where Kaneda says \\"Just when my coils were hitting the green line.\\"  In the new dub, he says \\"Just when my motor coils were heating up.\\"  The former has more character and sounds like something a hardcore biker would say in an English-speaking context, the latter sounds dull.  As for the previously-stated \\"cartoony\\" aspect to the Streamline dub, I don't really care because I loved the Ninja Turtles back in the early 90's, and that Cam Clarke gives Kaneda a much needed \\"arrogant punk\\" tone to his voice, and that the other cast in this dub feels just right for their roles.  However, in the Pioneer Dub, Bosch makes Kaneda sound like a whiny upper class kid in Burbank, completely sucking away any grittiness or coolness his character might have had; and that in general, Bosch has a terrible voice.  I even remember buying the \\"special edition\\" DVD about five days after first watching Akira and was ready to murder someone after hearing the new voice overs, so I sold it and bought an old Streamline VHS copy to introduce my friends to it until the Aussies got it right on DVD.  I know there's some old-time fans who loathe the Pioneer dub and I don't blame you.  If you guys have a regionless DVD player or a computer that can play DVDs from other regions, the Australian (Region 4) DVD of Akira has the Streamline dub on it with the remastered picture quality.  If you don't really care about dubs, I urge you to only watch this in Japanese, which is on all the DVDs andthe Blu-ray releases.    MY SUGGESTIONS    Akira really could have been the masterpiece many people see it as.  Katsuhiro Otomo, if you're reading this right now, swish the following in your head and give it some deep consideration.  Please remake Akira into a four part OVA series with each installment being an hour long.  You can use the same story you wrote for the movie adaptation and even keep many of the plot points the same, but please use the extra allotted time to develop the characters much better and to flesh out the intellectual themes much better.    FINAL WORD    Akira ISN'T the untouchable masterpiece that people claim it to be, but it's a good anime nonetheless, and if you like fairly intelligent action anime, then it'll probably sit comfortably in your collection. However, you're better off reading the Akira manga.  If you're just starting off with the anime genre, here's some masterful anime titles that make Akira pale in comparison to.    Grave of the Fireflies  Spirited Away  Ghost in the Shell  Perfect Blue  Paprika  Millennium Actress  Neo-Tokyo  Doomed Megalopolis  Battle Angel  Shigurui:  Death Frenzy

B000W4KT6E|4.0|Turning Hairspray into a musical could have been a disaster, and I watched it with a desire to hate it...but found myself won over instead.  I think Michelle Pfeiffer and Queen Latifah keep things real, preventing the satire from going completely to saccharine.    There was one big exception to my loving this movie.  My next comments will likely be the minority view, but I think John Travolta completely missed the mark.  OK, we always knew he wanted to put on a dress (well some of us did anyway) so no surprise there.  Also, I give him his props for giving ET his interpretation and sticking with it.  Yet...it doesn't quite work.  Playing it pathetic and needy was (and is) in my opinion a mistake.  Whether Divine or someone else, no self-respecting drag queen would ever be caught dead showing vulnerability.  And self-loathing would be subtextual, rather than surface.  So, in a way, he played ET as a \\"real\\" overweight straight woman, when the reality is he is a man in a dress pretending to be a woman...and we are supposed to take this seriously?  They should have cast someone playing a drag role with some \\"edge\\" or simply cast a straight woman, but an outwardly vulnerable drag queen interpretation doesn't play in my view.  Straight audiences probably have no idea what I am driving at, but I bet a lot of \\"other folk\\" get what I'm saying.  The only analogy I can give (and it's a bit strained) would have been to cast Motormouth Maybelle with a white actress, in \\"person of color,\\" slightly over the top makeup, and then treated it like it was totally for real rather than a put on.    Fortunately, the movie as a whole is so good that the ET role doesn't sink the movie, and I'm sure 90% of the people who watched the movie found his portrayal just dandy.

B001HN69AY|4.0|\\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\\" will, of course, go down in history as the movie Heath Ledger was working on at the time of his death.  But rather than let the movie die with his star, director Terry Gilliam hired several of Ledger's fellow actors - Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law - to take Ledger`s place in the few scenes that still remained to be filmed.  As such, it would be easy to focus on this rather unique turn of events and not on the fact that the finished product stands as an absorbing, imaginative and thought-provoking work in its own right.<br /><br />By setting his tale in the modern world, Gilliam brings a discipline to his storytelling and a reality to his flights of fancy that, in some of his previous works, have managed to get away from him.  The narrative focuses on a second-rate carnival troupe that travels around London in an elaborate but rickety carriage playing to inattentive, unappreciative - sometimes even downright hostile - audiences.  The troupe consists of Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), a thousand-year-old seer and magician who was granted immortality by the devil (Tom Waits) in exchange for handing over any female child he might have when she turned 16; Veronica (Lily Cole), his soon-to-be-sixteen-year-old daughter, who is unaware of the pact and who simply yearns for the day when she will be able to break free of the group and live a \\"normal\\" life; Anton (Andrew Garfield), a young assistant, who has feelings of his own for Veronica; Percy, a wisecracking dwarf (Verne Troyer) who provides the cutting voice of reason for the rest of the performers; and a mysterious, nameless man (the Ledger character) the troupe rescues from a suicide attempt, a man without memory or identity who joins their merry band and who, with his barker-like charisma, helps to finally generate some public interest in the act.  The flights of fancy come in the scenes involving a magic mirror the troupe uses as a part of its routine, a mirror that serves as a portal into the very imagination of Dr. Parnassus for anyone daring enough to step into it.<br /><br />The beauty of \\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\\" is that it rarely allows the fantasy elements to supersede the drama.  The script keeps its eyes firmly focused on the characters - their hopes and dreams, and the lives they're leading.  But there are deep, dark secrets to be uncovered and dealt with before the truth about the characters - especially Tony - can be fully revealed.<br /><br />Yet, it is when we go behind the mirror that we get to see Gilliam`s own fertile imagination in its fullest flower.  Here he has created an entire world out of distorted perspectives, painterly backdrops and the melding of CGI with human characters - and done so in a way that only Gilliam (and, perhaps, Tim Burton) can do it.<br /><br />Through the use of wardrobe and makeup, not only does Gilliam do a seamless job melding the three actors into the Ledger character, but, with the script, he manages to actually work Ledger's premature death and the fact that the part is played by several different people into the story itself.<br /><br />Ledger's work here, so full of energy, whimsy and understated pathos, truly reminds us of what a great talent we lost when he died so suddenly and so early - and makes us lament the great performances that we will never get to see in the future.  But all the acting in the film is topnotch, with Plummer, in particular, distinguishing himself as the world weary Parnassus forced to live an eternity of regret as a result of a rash action taken earlier in his life.<br /><br />This film is a fitting valedictory for an actor who took great delight in pushing the envelope when it came to choosing the role that would most help him to grow as an actor.  He will be sorely missed.s as a portal into the very imagination of Dr. Parnassus for anyone daring enough to step into it.

030745455X|5.0|Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist are back but not together.  Let's face it. Blomkvist is a cad, and Lisbeth is perplexed to realize that she's in love with him.  She travels for a year and then goes into hiding.  She becomes even more scarce when her fingerprints are found on a murder weapon.  We know, of course, never to count her out, as she's the weirdest heroine since Pippi Longstocking, another Swede whose name keeps popping up.  This series ranks right up there with Harry Potter, just as improbable, but more adult.  I enjoyed this book even more than the The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, partly because the characters were a little easier to keep track of, but mostly because it's just a better story--an action-packed murder mystery with Lisbeth and her friends Miriam and Paolo kicking some butt.  As the cops set their sights on Lisbeth as a suspect, Blomkvist launches his own investigation, not just to exonerate Lisbeth, but also to find the real killers of his two colleagues Mia and Dag.  He also knows that there are people in high places with motives, since they were about to be exposed for sex trafficking.  Along the way we discover some details of Lisbeth's past, including why she was declared incompetent by the courts and assigned to that scumbag guardian Bjurman.  I was on the edge of my seat during the finale, with Blomkvist to the rescue, periodically checking his watch, as his train is delayed.  Then he gets lost, becoming more harried and squandering precious minutes.  There are several loose ends that I'm looking forward to seeing tidied up in the third book, beyond just the bad guys getting their due.  I'm particularly interested to see what happens with Erika Berger, Blomkvist's married lover and business partner, as she plans to accept an editor-in-chief job at another magazine.  Will this cause a rift and free up Blomkvist to have a real relationship with Lisbeth?  Why am I rooting for 20-something and a 40-something to get together?

B002VPE1B6|4.0|When the first Avatar trailer hit the theaters, I didn't want to see the movie.<br /><br />Everything they showed during the trailer screamed futuristic Ferngully to me, and I wanted nothing to do with the movie. When it hit theaters, and in the past month, when all of the \\"Best movie ever\\" hype started, I still had no desire to see this movie. However, I finally said to myself \\"Well what the heck, I have gift cards to the movies...it'll be free, and if it sucks, then it sucks.\\"<br /><br />Avatar is probably one of the best films I have seen.<br /><br />While the general plot is nothing new, and you can almost predict certain lines in the film before they happen, the way the story is told and the visual style it's presented in makes this one of the most imaginative movies in the past decade. The movie itself is three hours long, and even though that might seem like a long period of time to tell a basic story, there is so much going on constantly in the world of Pandora that the time will fly by and will leave you wanting more.<br /><br />Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a wheelchair-bound military man who's brother Tom recently passed away. Jake comes to find out that his brother was working on a special genetic military experiment, and that Jake can finish this experiment because they share the same basic DNA. Jake agrees, and gets to travel light years away to the world of Pandora, a world that most people have only heard about. The world of Pandora is inhabited by the Na'vi, a blue cat-like race who live within the lush jungles of the planet. Upon arrival, Jake finds out that he's involved in the \\"Avatar\\" program, a program that lets you control a Na'vi looking creation, who's made out of both your own and Na'vi DNA.<br /><br />Jake meets Norm Spellman (Joel Moore), the other new recruit for the avatar program, and the two meet the other doctors on the project; Grace Augustine (Sigorney Weaver) and Max Patel (Dileep Rao). Grace is the head of the science aspect of this project, and she's working towards making a peaceful connection with the Na'vi. This is imporant, because the reason the humans are on Pandora, is to mine Unobtainium (good name!), a super precious ore that's worth millions to corporations on Earth, and the cure for the energy crisis that Earth is facing. The Resources Development Administration, led by Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribis), is the group that's facilitating all of the mining and interaction between Earth/Pandora/Humans/Na'vi. Along with Parker, there's also Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who is extremely military-minded, and wants to shoot anything that moves, just to help get to the Unobtainium ore.<br /><br />Colonel Miles pulls Jake aside, and talks to him about helping get the military inside information about the Na'vi, to help their cause. Miles also promises Jake that if he helps with all of the scheming, that Miles can put a word in with the military to help Jake get his legs back again. This all leads to the first conflict in the movie, science/humanity vs military to accomplish the goal of getting the ore from the Na'vi homeland.<br /><br />As Na'vi Jake (NJ from now on) goes into Pandora for the first time, he has some run-ins with the local animal life, and ends up stranded from his group. He eventually gets left behind, and has to fend for himself during the night. Trouble starts, and NJ is attacked by what look like zombie dogs, only to be saved at the last second by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a young Na'vi girl. After saving NJ, Neytiri yells at him for the fact that the dogs had to die, and that everything on their planet deserves to live. As they talk, Neytiri receives a sign from Ewya (the spirit of mother nature) that NJ has a warm heart, and is there to help them. She takes him back to Hometree (their home city), and introduces the Na'Vi tribe to him, including her arranged husband Tsu'Tey, and her parents Eytukan (dad) and Mo'at (mom). Neytiri tells everyone about how NJ is there to help them, and to understand the \\"sky people\\", and that she wants to train him to be a Na'vi. The elders reluctantly agree, and this starts conflict two in the movie : Jake's allegiance to the Na'vi vs his allegiance to the humans.<br /><br />Without discussing more of the plot, anyone can see where this movie is heading. Will Jake help the humans or help the Na'vi? Will the brute force approach accomplish things, or will peaceful democracy get the humans what they need. These are the two \\"main\\" conflicts in the movie, but as the film progresses, there are multiple smaller storylines that appear, and the conclusion to each of the smaller stories are just as important as the main conclusion to the film.<br /><br />The grand story is simple yet robust, with a twist here and there about what you might think is about to happen, but it's nothing over the top or outlandish. There are \\"slow\\" times in this film, where it's just random conversations, or training montages, but as a whole it all works well together.<br /><br />One of the weird concepts that appeared since this movie came out is Pandora Depression, where there's apparently groups of people who are sad and depressed that Pandora isn't a real world. I don't know if this is a testament to how realistic the graphics have become in films (or this one specifically), or if people just get really hyped up about movies, but it's interesting that people seem to be so engrossed in this film that this \\"condition\\" is even any part of reality in 2010. I don't remember ever hearing anyone having issues with The Shire not being real, or not being able to fight with lightsabers when LotR/StarWars came out, so who knows what future films will bring us as digital films become more and more realistic.<br /><br />Overall (and once again), this is a movie that NEEDS to be seen.

B002VECM6S|5.0|1.  This is one of the rare movies that actually lives up to the hype:  well written, well acted, and most importantly--> an inspiring story to tell.  Highly recommended to all.  A great family film as well.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Lets all remember back to our early childhoods...<br /><br />It's bedtime in our cozy little rooms, our parents are tucking us into bed, saying goodnight and that they'll see us in the morning. They turn the lights out, close the door behind them, our eyes drifting shut, thinking of the happy thoughts from the day...That's when you hear a creak in your room. Your eyes dart from side to side, wondering what that noise was that stirred the silence. All of a sudden a dark silhouette starts staring at you from across your room, leaning towards you in your bed. You watch in terror as it seems to dance back and forth as it comes closer towards you. As it's about to pounce, you freeze and can do nothing but scream bloody murder in hopes that your parents save you from this evil monster who's somehow gotten into your room. All of a sudden, the lights come on, mom or dad rush in and ask what's wrong. You tell them about the monster that almost ate you from across the room, and they point out that it must just be your imagination, and you only saw the shadow of your lamp. They once again say goodnight, thinking that you're just a silly kid, but you know better, you know you saw something coming from your closet.<br /><br />Monsters Inc is a hilarious and adorable take on the monsters that lived in your closet when you were a kid. The story revolves around Mike Wazowski, a little green one-eyed monster with a sharp wit, James \\"Sulley\\" Sullivan, a lovable large blue and purple striped fuzzball of a monster, and Monsters Inc, their place of work. Monsters Inc is the leading power supplier for Monstropolis, and we come to find out that the monsters who terrified us as children were only trying to collect our screams of terror to power their homes, offices, and local drinking establishments. Sulley is the leading scarer at work, and is almost about to break the scare-record, but Randall, a chameleon/snake hybrid, is hot on his trail in being the best scarer. Everything is going great for Mike and Sulley, until one day a small child nicknamed Boo, sneaks back into the monster's world through her closet door, and everyone's lives change. Children are believed to be \\"dangerous\\" to the monsters, and anyone who comes in contact with even a piece of their clothing is instantly decontaminated (Code 2319 - learn it, you'll hear it a lot).<br /><br />This child invasion can't come at a worse time, as Monsters Inc is in trouble, since kids aren't as easily scared as they used to be. The story deals with Mike/Sulley's friendship, the competition between Sulley and Randall for leading scarer, and everyone's interactions with Boo. While all of this seems silly and simple, there's a lot of depth with all of the characters involved, and even Monstropolis has it's own charms.<br /><br />Pixar (who was still a newer company at this point) once again did a fantastic job with the vibrant colors and attention to detail throughout their world. All of the monsters look extremely \\"realistic\\" and lifelke, and with the popularity of HD movies now you can actually see the stray strands of fur on the fuzzy monsters. There are a lot of different characters in the film, and every one looks very individualistic, adding for a lot of diversity, as well as showing the creativity of the writers/animators at Pixar.<br /><br />The world itself looks like something straight out of any normal suburban city, with trees lining the sidewalks, normal everyday businesses lining the streets, and cars puttering down the roads. Small attention to details are abound in Pixar films, and after watching this film again recently, I noticed more of the smaller things, like the sale signs in the grocery store selling blood oranges, and other \\"scarily\\" named items.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of Pixar films (as well as Dreamworks, and pretty much anything animated), is the amount of creativity the creators can give themselves with the worlds they create. When dealing with a world of monsters who terrorize children from out of their closets, Pixar can think of the creepiest terrors that a kid would imagine, and make a living breathing version of it. This ability to be able to showcase creativity, and Pixar's creative talents, make for AMAZING films every time one is released.<br /><br />Overall, this is probably one of Pixar's best films. The amount of time and creativity put into this world of lovable monsters shows throughout the film, hitting on all aspects of a great movie. The story is great, the characters are lovable (even the monsters who are jerks are still enjoyable), and the father/daughter dynamic between a giant blue fuzzy monster and a little tiny toddler girl are heart-warming, and even at some points tear-jerking.losets, Pixar can think of the creepiest terrors that a kid would imagine, and make a living breathing version of it. This ability to be able to showcase creativity, and Pixar's creative talents, make for AMAZING films every time one is released.    Overall, this is probably one of Pixar's best films.

B003U9TDII|3.0|I'll assume you're buying this score because you saw 'Inception' and it affected you deeply enough to want to relive it again and again through the music. Although Hans Zimmer's scores generally irritate me with their lazy bombast, there was no way I was going to not get this album; whatever it took to perpetuate the feelings and emotions that 'Inception' gave me. Much of the score is fairly low-key and moody, and there are 'Gladiator'-esque moments of spastic, vaguely ethnic drumming and melody, but it's those terrifying blasts of breath and sound that we were all introduced to originally in Zach Helmsley's 'Mind Heist' trailer music which elevate the entire score into the realm of 'play that again, please.' As opposed to obvious melodic themes, this time it's those pounding sounds, a crazed synthesis of vocals, horns and drums, which remind me of the way 'Inception' gripped me from moment one.<br /><br />One last thing I loved: the partial inclusion of the Edith Piaf dream-kick. It's incorporated into the overall score just as it was in the film, rather than tacking on the entire song to the end of the album. Awesome.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|Taking a piece of literature and turning it into a feature film is a risky endeavor. By taking your own vision and projecting it into a form everyone can see, you're instantly setting yourself up for constant criticisms thoughout the film...\\"Well this isn't how I pictured this city to look at all\\"...\\"She shouldn't look like that, I thought she would be ______\\"...\\"He lived in the book, why did he die in the movie\\"...The more well known the book/story is, the more this will inevitable happen as well.<br /><br />I mention all of this, because 2009's A Christmas Carol, will take most preconceptions of what Dickens' story portrayed, and twist them visually in some strange ways. One quick thing to note about the movie, is that only a handful of characters look \\"good\\" in the animation style that the film uses. Scrooge, the ghosts, and one or two other main characters look normal, but the rest of the people in this world are extremely creepy looking, almost like something you would see from Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />The film opens with Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) seeing his dead partner's corpse, pronouncing him dead, rips off the funeral workers (setting his \\"scrooge\\" ways in action), and leaves the morgue, which starts a fly-by of the city and it's villagers while Scrooge is traveling to work. Upon arriving to his office, the movie fast forwards seven years into the future, and starts the classic tale we all know. We meet Cratchit (Gary Oldman), who is extremely creepy looking, and we meet two of the charity collectors who Scrooge decides to take down a few notches. Scrooge's nephew Fred (Colin Firth) comes to invite him to family dinner, but Scrooge quickly points out how much Christmas is worthless, and he wouldn't dare be bothered to arrive. At the end of this work shift (Dec 24th), Cratchit asks to have all of Christmas off, which sets Scrooge off into another one of his trademark fits, but is eventually allowed to spend the day with his family, only if he comes into work early on the 26th.<br /><br />This is the point where the film takes a lot of weird turns, and if you truly enjoy the classic film/novel versions of Christmas Carol, you will probably not enjoy the next 40-50 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />Scrooge gets home, and upon arriving to his front door, sees a ghosts face on his door knocker. He gets startled, and falls down his front steps in what looks to be a painful way. One thing throughout this movie, is that Scrooge is constantly falling/getting beat up, and it never seems to affect a man who must be 60-70 years old. While sitting in his bedroom, he starts to hear his door rattle, and then the ghost of Jacob Marley appears. By appears, I mean throws ghostly metal boxes through the door at Scrooge, and then eventually comes in after them. They talk about the three ghosts coming to visit Scrooge tonight, and Marley lets him know the times they are coming.<br /><br />/* I don't know if it was just me, but if you listen to the times that the ghost gives for the visits, they don't match up with the timeline of the movie */<br /><br />Marley's ghost does all sort of weird things while he's talking, such as ripping his jaw off, and then slapping it up and down on his mouth, to talk to Scrooge, and then pulls it over his face to finish the conversation. This is one of those weird moments that started to \\"ruin\\" the movie for me. I realize it's a retelling, and the director can do whatever he wants, but it just seems like they want to make the movie \\"extreme\\".<br /><br />Marley's ghost leaves, and the story progresses as you would expect. The Ghost of Christmas Past (Jim Carrey), which is a ghost body with a candle's flame for a face/head, shows Scrooge his sad childhood. The Ghost of Christmas Present (Jim Carrey), is a big jovial man (about 20-30 feet tall) who shows Scrooge how much fun people can have being either poor, or without his miserable company. These two ghosts, while visually weird looking, are prettyspot on to how the original book was written.<br /><br />The Ghost of Christmas Future, is the one which bothers me the most. The ghost is the Grim Reaper (which is fine), but the sequence of events involving him are ridiculous. This part (maybe 5-10 minutes), is slapstick comedy, where Scrooge is somehow shrunken, talking with a squeaky \\"I've been shrunk\\" voice, and falls through street drains and runs through pipes in an attempt to get away from the ghost. This scene goes on way too long, and you'll eventually find yourself asking when the ghost will finally catch him to continue the story.<br /><br />After all of the visions are done for the night, Scrooge wakes up, feels proud to be alive, and runs through town celebrating his new found love for everyone. There's a few touching moments here as Scrooge rights his wrongs, but nothing that wouldn't be expected.<br /><br />As a whole, the entire movie is one of those feel good Christmas stories, where you can watch it with your family, and maybe learn a life lesson or two throughout. The major flaw I see with this adaptation, as I said earlier, the visuals will either make or break this movie for you, but other then that, I have no real complaints.ost of Christmas Future, is the one which bothers me the most.

0439023491|4.0|SPOILERS<br />I really enjoyed reading both hunger games and catching fire. In catching fire i couldn't stop thinking about what was going on in the districts and the capital during the quarter quell. I kind of wish Suzanne Collins would have done first person point of view with different main characters like Gale, Peeta, & Haymitch. I think it would have brought more excitement to the this installment if the reader got to see what was going on in the districts through gales point of view (the battles he may have been in) and what was going on in the capital through Haymitch (plans with the head game maker and any other rebels). It might have made the book longer but way more interesting. I really like when books go to different parts of the story instead of staying in one character's pov or at least do some sort of combination of 1st person and 3rd person. I still wish gale was more in the stories. I bet he will be in the 3rd book even more, which is exciting because we will get to know more about him and how his relationship will progress with katniss. Out of peeta and gale, I think that katniss should be with gale. I thought it was pretty clever the way the force field was taken down in the quarter quell and how the escape was executed. I kind of knew it was coming just b/c of how often the force field was mentioned and how character's beetee and wiress were inventors and scientifically inclined. This book ended at a very intense moment and I feel like there needs to be more than just one more book left to be released. I really hope it's a lot longer book than the first two.  I'm very curious to find out more about district 13 and their capabilities, weapons, and how many rebels are hidden there; and what the plan of action will be to take down the capital. Peeta is smart and a smooth talker I know he will contribute to the take down as well in a different way while working from the inside. I cannot wait to see how this last installment will play out. Let the revolution begin! Starting august 24th, of course!olution begin! Starting august 24th, of course!

B002ZG97RE|5.0|It seems as though everything breaks down along political lines these days, even movie reviews on Amazon.  Right wingers say this movie is liberal pablum. Left wingers who say that this movie tells the truth that we all knew anyway.  But they don't review the film.     So since none of us are David Denby or Anthony Lane,  here goes a super brief review:    Matt Damon delivers a purposeful, severe and gritty performance.  He doesn't smile once in any scene.      The action sequences are also predictably grim.      Greg Kinnear gives his first bad-guy performance, and he is quite believable.      And then there's Igal Naor, who did such an amazing job of playing Saddam Hussein on the HBO miniseries, shines as General Al Rawi, the man who was \\"misquoted\\" about WMD's at a Jordan meeting just prior to Shock and Awe.      The direction by Paul Greengrass is slick and chase oriented, as he did so well in the 'Bourne Ultimatum.'      Regardless how you feel about the Iraqi war, this movie will move you emotionally.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Inception is a great movie, one of the best action movies of the year. It is nothing if not a concept movie, science fiction which often seems on the brink of fantasy, but actually has some basis in reality.<br /><br />Fast paced from beginning to end. Inception is based on the idea of Lucid Dreaming, a difficult to master skill wherein the practitioner develops the ability to consciously recognize within their dream that they ARE dreaming and then manipulate the content of their dreams. This is a real endeavor which takes a great deal is discipline and years of practice to achieve. People do this! see \\"Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming\\" by Stephen Laberge.  But they only can manipulate their own dreams, if that.<br /><br />The plot here, within giving away much you won't see in the first ten minutes, is the hero Cobb (another hard role for Leonardo DiCaprio, like Shudder Island) is trying to alter the dream not only of himself, but of someone else, an industrial magnate, Fischer (Cillian Murphy), using a team of dream architects and manipulators - Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Eames (Tom Hardy), Ariadne (Ellen Page), and Yusuf (Dileep Rao). Sort of industrial espionage. This part is Sci-fi - it can't be done, at least not now. To borrow an information Technology concept, the magnate has nested dreams, dreams within dreams within dreams, five layers deep, like nested do-loops! Cobb and the Dream Team seek to implant an idea deep within the subconscious of the target and give him the idea he thought of it himself.<br /><br />Inception has fabulous special effects, as you might imagine. The actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt  (Arthur),  playing a dream manipulator, was on David Letterman's Show talking about this movie and he said the director Christopher Nolan made minimal use of the omnipresent Blue Screen CGI technology for special effects and actually had Gordon-Levitt and others suspended from wires instead, in many dream sequences, to make them weirder and less, well special-effecty than CGI. There is a spectacular special effect in Montmartre, in Paris, where a dream architect folds the whole city over on itself like a half peanut butter sandwich! This effect is certainly blue screen CGI, but others where the director turns the whole room was done with actors, wires and a turning room like the Fred Astaire movie where he dances on the ceiling!<br /><br />The story? Five layers deep in nested dreams the motivations get pretty murky. There's a lot of car chases, poorly motivated bad guys as we deal with Cobbs subconscious contents/demons. But is all exciting and fun anyway and a special effect tour de force. What a concept! Keeps you on the edge of your seat for two hours or so. Sci-fi and fantasy people should like this movie, IT people, younger males etc but the viewer has to pay attention.<br /><br />The movie poses the philosophical question: what is there underneath all the dreams?<br /><br />Back to reality, this movie is sci-fi, but there are places in this country where experimenters with Lucid Dreaming discovered that two lucid dreamers can, under some circumstances, have somewhat shared realities within their dreams, as fantastic as that sounds. Really! see Silva Mind Control books and Robert Monroe...CGI.

0061537969|5.0|This book touched my heart, and once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. I have never cried or laughed as much as I have with this book. I ordered it for a friend, who also couldn't put it down.... and since it has left his hands, it has been through almost a dozen other eager readers.     Garth Stein has woven a wonderful story with his characters. Looking at the world through the eyes of a dog gives you such a different a profound perspective on the fragile life we all lead. I have had so many people thank me for recommending this book.
0753801728|5.0|I saw the movie first and read the book 2 days later.  I was blown away by the story.  The philosophical questions it raises are haunting.  I am so glad I saw the movie first, because there were no spoilers...all a surprise.  The book then fleshed out the story in ways that the film did not.  This was a story that needed to be told.  It humanizes and somewhat gives rationale to those who arguably unwittingly conspired to commit one of the worst atrocities in history.  It was clear to me, however, that Hanna never forgave herself and was haunted by what she had done. It is also clear that Michael loved her and was never able to get over her. By seducing him as a minor, Hanna actually perpetrated another crime, although it didn't feel that way when reading the story...it felt more like a love story.  He was tortured for life, however, which is why coming of age shouldn't happen this way.  In the end, perhaps he was able to move on. Questions remain as to who Hanna really was and why she had no family or friends.
B00000DGRX|5.0|This was one of my favorite bands of all time, and purchasing this (after having it lost) again made my day. It is the so-called Mark IV version of Deep Purple with Ian Gillan singing, and while Blackmore was at the helm.     The songs are timeless, they stand up after all these years, and the sound quality has been made better by the remaster (something that is not always true).    Gillan is in great voice (when is he not?), and as the best vocalist/screamer of the rock era, he commands attention in a way no other does. The only other singer of this era that comes close is Paul Rodgers [Free/Bad Company/The Law].  There is no one today that can match the vocal skills of this man on this wide a variety of music.     As for Blackmore, when he stated he could wipe the floor with most guitarists, he was not blowing smoke. The same can be said of Jon Lord, Ian Paice, and Roger Glover. These guys were individually great, and yet there was a synergy that made them better together.    This is every fan's favorite DP album, and it was required in every car (in 8 track form) in every vehicle in the years 1973 to 1979 - simply so your late night high speed cruising could be accompanied by \\"Highway Star\\".     Check the song list, if you don't know every one of them already, you simply are not a rock fan. Still, if you don't, buying this could change your life.

0312382464|1.0|Falls the Shadow was Penman's last chance to impress me and she failed.  I picked up Penman's Henry II trilogy after reading Alison Weir's biography of Eleanor of Aquitaine.  I somehow got through When Christ and His Saints Slept (it almost put me to sleep).  I enjoyed Time and Chance because this was my first encounter with Henry II in fiction.  Devil's Brood was tough to finish, but if you do, you definitely come away with a sense of accomplishment.  Instead of the author giving a richness and depth to the characters that can supplement a sometimes dry historical record, the Plantagenet clan carried their own weight because they were so interesting in real life.<br /><br />Next I read Frank McLynn's Richard and John: Kings at War, and was afterward eager to read Penman's Welsh trilogy because Falls the Shadow features Henry III; I can't find a biography of him, so I thought historical fiction would suffice.  I genuinely enjoyed Here Be Dragons right up until Joanna committed adultery.  I know that it happens and that it is often used as a plot device, but her actions totally turned me off.  I also feel this novel needed more direction.<br /><br />So after 4 books of stiff, stilted dialogue and mediocre character development, I wearily plunged into Falls the Shadow.  I got 70 pages in and had to stop.  Verily it be the unbelievable dialogue that would make 13th century denizens scratch their heads, for certes.  But it was the romance between Nell (sister to the King of England) and Simon (a knight) that made me put the book down.  They exchange meaningful glances a few times and all of a sudden they are deeply in love and bound and determined to get married in spite of all the trouble it will cause Henry III and his barons and despite the fact that Nell took a vow of chastity.  I just don't buy their relationship and wish I hadn't bought this book!

However, I was more than happily surprised to read such a thought-provoking book that was a heartfelt story, yet still managed to come off light and funny at times. It was the perfect combination of depression and hopefulness that led me to wish the story continued. The way Matthew Quick wove the story around something as abstract as an undrafted rookie in the most brutal NFL city of Philly was pure genius. This is a fantastic read! I loved every page.

B000EWBKK8|4.0|`Lord of War' is a jet-black satire that follows the rise and rise of Yuri (Nicolas Cage), a Ukranian-American who eventually becomes one of the world's leading arms dealers.  In cynical fashion, Yuri narrates his life story, demonstrating how he succeeded in the arms trade through a combination of ruthless ambition and complete indifference to the motives of his clients.  We follow his relationships with his drug-addicted brother Vitaly and his model wife Ava, his cosying up to a brutal African dictator, and his pursuit by incorruptible Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke).     This is certainly one black comedy. Warfare and arms dealing are hardly light-hearted subjects, but the film is able to find humour in the darkest situations. Cage's droll, cynical narration and a tight, fast-paced script succeed in portraying the often absurd nature of global politics and international trade. The satirical nature of the film is balanced out by more serious scenes portraying the pointless violence and brutality in West Africa, particularly during the second half of the film.  Think `Blood Diamond' crossed with `Thank You For Smoking' and you'll get some idea of the tone of `Lord Of War'.     The characterisation is a bit of a mixed bag, but the cast do a good job in their roles. Nicolas Cage has done this stream-of-consciousness navel gazing many times before (`Bringing Out The Dead', `Adaptation', `Weather Man') so if you liked him in any of those films you'll appreciate his performance here. Ethan Hawke gets the balance perfect as the incorruptible Valentine, making him principled without being naïve. I also really liked the character of Weisz, the supposedly \\"principled\\" arms dealer who only sells to those whose cause he supports. But Jared Leto and Bridget Moynahan are saddled with mediocre characters. Vitaly serves no real purpose at all except to be \\"messed up\\" and cause trouble for Yuri. And Ava isn't particularly sympathetic despite her plight; she seemed perfectly happy to play the doormat trophy wife and live off the back of Yuri's ill-gotten gains, only to come over all moral and principled late in the film.    While I personally quite liked the film, I do have a couple of problems with it:    Firstly, there is no real development of Yuri's character at all, despite everything that happens to him in the film. For something that's supposed to be a character study, it's frustrating that there's not even a hint of either redemption or come-uppance.     Secondly, there is a fair amount of predictable Hollywood moralising, such as equating the Florida recount (have they still not gotten over that yet?) with brutal African dictatorships, plus the inevitable claim that it's the US and its allies who are really the bad guys.  Undoubtedly there's some truth here, but the heavy-handed nature of the preaching feels clunky and forced given the satirical nature of the rest of the film.      These drawbacks prevent `Lord of War' from being a truly great film, but it is still a very good one. Highly recommended for those who love their humour dark and have a healthy cynicism about world affairs. Four stars.
B001NFNFIK|4.0|Not as good as the book (big surprise!). However, Tommy Lee Jones does a good job as Dave Robicheaux. John Goodman as \\"Baby Feet\\" Balboni is a joke.    Got a good feel for the area and the people. Loved the music.
0765356147|5.0|The final book in a trilogy really makes it, and I have to say this book lifts the Mistborn trilogy into the category of \\"brilliant\\". Everything is flawlessly pulled together in a way that make you realise how carefully structured the trilogy is as a whole. It's rare that a fantasy novel can give me an ending that is both unexpected and satisfying (usually it's one or the other) but this does both.     I love where Sanderson has taken this trilogy - from destroying the Lord Ruler to realising that maybe that wasn't such a great idea, to believing the Well of Ascension would solve everything, to realising maybe that wasn't such a great idea also. Consequences seem to be the main theme driving this trilogy - happy endings don't just happen magically because you slew the bad guy. The characters have grown since the first book, especially the minor characters. Sazed and Spook feature as major characters in this book alongside Elend and Vin. Elend and Vin's trust in each other is a note of light in a world that appears to be ending around them. Sazed's soul-searching journey to find 'truth' fleshes him out as a character.     Definitely read the first two first, and definitely finish this series if you start it. It's totally worth it.
1400049628|5.0|The other day I was looking around a book shop, trying to find a gift for my friend's birthday, when I accidentally stumbled upon this book.    I had seen a classmate reading it before, and it sounded so zany that I ended up purchasing it. I had no idea what to expect from this book, but after reading it, I am certainly glad that I bought it.    \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is wacky. It's weird. It's totally realistic sounding. It's full of extremely clever passages, facts and tips on how to survive a zombie attack. It makes it sound as though a zombie attack could happen at any minute, anywhere.    Believe it or not, this book is an all-night pageturner. I had to force myself to put it down at nearly 4:00 am, and then kept thinking about it for the next half hour. In the morning, it was the first thing that I picked up.    Overall, \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is extremely clever, entertaining, and actually pretty funny if you think about it. I would highly recommend it to anybody who can take a joke. Wouldn't quite recommend it for children, because the book is so serious-sounding and would make them believe that zombies are out to get them, but it would most likely be fine for ages 10+.    If you'd like a good bite of humor (no pun intended), go and pick up this book. I can guarantee that it will be well worth the money.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I recently purchased the Elizabeth Gaskell series of movies, Cranford, North and South and Wives and Daughters.  I saved North and South for last.  The first two movies I thought were very good, but North and South is one of the best (if not the best) movies I have ever seen.  I couldn't help when watching it (and my daughter thought so too) of the comparison between 1995 Pride and Prejudice.  I noticed the comparison especially in the proposal scene.  Let me tell you I was mesmorized by this movie from beginning to end.  I loved all of the characters, especially the relationship between Margaret and Thornton, Thornton and his mother, and Thornton and Higgins.  I think that I have watched it in the short time I have owned it about 5 times straight through.  The train scene is breath taking.  How Thornton's whole demeanor changes when he sees Margaret in the train station and how he looks at her with such love in his eyes.   I have watched that scene about a couple of dozen times so far and it has now become the favorite ending of any movie I have ever seen.  I would definitlely recommend this movie to anyone who likes period dramas (which have recently become my favorite types of movies especially when they are done by BBC).  But you don't have to be a particular fan of period dramas to like North and South.  If you have any emotion in you at all you will fall instantly in love with it.

B002U33GUQ|5.0|This is one of those CDs where you can safely believe the 4+ star rating. Every song on it is sublime. Mehldau's melodic innovations are so far ahead of what commonly passes for \\"music\\" today, that this CD is in a class by itself. One might deduct points in comparison to his other CDs, but that is for people more familiar with his body of work.    It seems that, on Amazon, even the most pedestrian, overwrought, rudimentary, badly written and played CDs routinely garner 4 star ratings. In view of this anomaly, you should consider this to be a 10 star effort.

If you miss this book you will regret it! From the first few pages you are hooked! I read the entire thing in two days (if I didn't have to work full time it would have been one). If you liked books such as \\"The Host\\" and \\"The Giver\\" you will LOVE this book. I put off reading it for awhile because I usually stick to the same few writers. Suzanne Collins is now added to that list of writers. You will love this book!
B000002URV|5.0|Me personally,I'm an Enigma fan :)I can't recommend the 'roman numeral' album enough to explain how awesome it is!By the way,the music is not geared for goth-rock fans.All Enigma represents is an obscure artist with a female vocalist that blends New Age,Electronica, with occassional samples of opera,nature sounds,greogorian chants,and even a little bit of electric guitar thrown in...basically a sound collage.Enigma's 'romal numeral' album can only be described as erotic lol.Put the album to clever use ;)
1592403913|3.0|I had heard so much about this book. Being a linguistics master, I thought it would be right up my alley. And it was, at first. But after a while it gets a little repetitive and frankly, boring.<br /><br />That said, I would still recommend it. It is unique, witty, and informative.
0805091742|4.0|The book is easy to read and keeps you interested and occupied. It elaborates on a very simple concept of using \\"check lists\\" to get things right for repetitive complex or not so complex tasks. I was used to using a mental list of things to check, but this books makes you aware of the process and so you could use it at places where you would have not thought of using it before. Very interesting writing.
0307474712|5.0|I read the whole book in one breath... and ended up enjoying my moment even more, mesmerized by the beauty and fluency of the story, captured by the characters so close to life reality. Its something from everyone of us I believe, taking life as it is, hoping for things we don't even know that we want and ending up where we really want to be.... It's a time machine that I always wondered the answer for... filled with the answers to \\"what if\\"s. Leaving you thoughtful, sad, hopeful, happy, but all the way filled with joy.
0743496736|4.0|This is the kind of book that you think about long after you have read the last page.  It is haunting because it rings very true.  Picoult did a great job of re-creating some of the worst school disasters in this book. She brings you inside to the lives of all involved.  It is truly a book to be thought about, talked about, and pondered.
B002UD56I6|5.0|I have never been a true fan of Michael Jackson but always thought of him as a great performer.  This video reinforces that thought.  It is interesting, very thoughtfully done with reverence to the deceased star.  I have watched it several times since receiving it.  It is a true memorial to a great performer.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I have to say, with the blue ray coming out that this is a great movie.  What you have in the movie are a group of really bad people who are doing bad things, all the time and no one is stopping them.  This is What the kick ass character is about.  Now many who like this movie think that his part is actually the weakest.  I disagree.  It is through his eyes that the dilemma of good people is observed, and he shows the difference between himself and the serious nature of the really bad people.  Good people have a lot to lose to the bad guys.  That is why it is so easy to do nothing in the face of evil.  Kick Ass learns that lesson.  He also acts as the important contrast to Hit Girl and Big Daddy.  Hit Girl and Big Daddy are also great.  They deal with the bad guys without the self doubt typically forced onto hero characters.  The people they kill are evil.  Really evil.  I am not very good with words so I'll send you to two reviews that really touch on why this movie is great.  John Nolte at Andrew Breitbarts Big Hollywood website gives a good review of the film.   John Nolte also takes on Roger Eberts review of the film and details why Ebert is a hypocrite when it comes to Hit Girl and the reviews of other movies.  Check out the other reviewer at Brietbart's site.  He called Kick Ass one of the best Libertarian films of all time.  To those people who are implying things about Hit Girl, her costume and her language, you're wrong.  People complained about the violence against an 11 year old girl.  99 percent of the violence is Hit Girl killing bad guys.   She simply shows no remorse about killing evil people.  As to her costume, she is actually modestly dressed, the skirt is there to show she is a girl, but she is in a full costume besides that.  Her language is bad because the hollywood type who wrote the script is an adolescent in an adult body and couldn't help himself.    It does differ from the source material but it does so by improving on the source material.The story now makes much more sense and is not as teenager driven as the comic book.   I have to say, the scene of the rescue is great as is the final battle with a small exception.  The music and the images in this movie really complement each other.   It is an adult movie but it is a good one.
B001KVZ6F2|3.0|Since I had heard this was Clint Eastwood's best movie, I was anxious to view it.  The story line was OK, but I just don't like the gutter language from the gang members, but I guess that's the only language they know.  They lack education and therefore vocabulary so what else is there for them to say in trying to have an exchange of communication with each other.  Glad I got a bargain on the price and didn't spend bucks at a theater.
0937381888|5.0|Yes, we all probably started with Charlie Papzian's book which is fine, but he is the \\"old generation\\" of homebrewing. Within the last 15 or so years, the hobby of homebrewing has matured. Equipment has gotten better and ingredients are of higher quality. How To Brew is up to date and utilizes the most current brewing knowledge. John Palmer also helps to dispel many of these Old Generation paradigms.     Being an Enginneer, I respect the fact that all of his information is backed up with sound science which is essential in learning how to brew. This book is a must have reference book if you have brewed once or if you have brewed for 20 years.
B003OCWF6I|3.0|I was told this movie was a \\"must-see\\" and I cannot agree after buying the bluray/dvd/digital copy. Although it IS a halfway decent action flick, there were holes in the plot that were so obvious that it was frustrating to watch and I frequently found my attention wandering away from the movie. The movie seemed rushed and too many gimmicks were thrown in, in my opinion. For instance:<br />The character, Pooch makes a rocket (McGuyver style) and fires it into the air at absolutely nothing and the team is celebrating but this rocket isn't used for anything. it was a pointless plot sequence.<br />Again, Pooch is flying a helicopter over an operation and somehow, 1 man on the ground recognises him and begins firing at him. There is NO WAY he would have been recognised from the ground. All the man does is looks up in the air and says \\"Pooch\\". He can't even see into the helicopter.<br />Another character, Jensen was more annoying and cliche'd than entertaining. Everytime you see him, they changed his tshirt as though they were advertising for a friends business.<br />There were frequent plot holes like this in the movie but as for a run of the mill action flick that you can watch to waste some time, go ahead.
B001HZ9ABM|4.0|Can we finally blow this myth about every ambitious rock album being compared to the Beatles [[ASIN:B000002UAU Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]. There was orchestral rock before this masterpiece, and most rock albums using strings and horns from 1967 or 1968 sound nothing like Sgt. Pepper.<br /><br />Odessa sure doesn't. Where Pepper was really, on one level, about applying any type of music to rock--making it a limitless expanse, Odessa is extremely consistent in sound.<br /><br />Odessa shoots for an almost Spectorian, Wagnerian sense of orchestral pop. Huge strings, huge echo on the voices. Listen and the Beegees seem to sing out of the funnel center of the bigness they crate.<br /><br />You'd better get used to this  sound if planning to sit through Odessa, because it runs through what was a double album. (Young? Call mom and she'll explain.) If you like this sound, it is like being stuck in orchestral mud honey. Just surrender and drown in it for the next seventy minutes. There are deviations: some silly sixties light pop, and some country tinged experiments that really work.<br /><br />But what there is not is a grinding guitar like on Pepper's \\"Getting Better,\\" rock and roll stomp like\\"Good Morning.\\" You would barley know guitars plugged into amplifiers listening to Odessa.<br /><br />I understand why Pepper is used as a bench mark, and in the sense that rock bands were more free to \\"experiment,\\" after Pepper, this is accurate. But if Odessa does not actually sound like the Fabs benchmark, that is ok. This massive red string thing sounds fine on it's own
B003F5WOEC|4.0|The Black Keys create a dense, heavy, but intensely soulful feel on this excellent new disc.  Great hooks are not in short supply here either.  Some may critisize these relatively young musicians of trying to be too hip or trying to ape old blues/ soul singers, but the Black Keys have created their own unique and classic voice with \\"Brothers\\".  This album is not one dimesional either getting way down in the funky swamp with the intoxicating instrumental \\"Black Mud\\" to soul raveups like \\"Howlin' For You\\", to the sweet soul stylings of \\"The only One\\".  Some of the other tracks alternate from blues to rock to funk.  It never gets boring, that's for sure.  I also want to say, this is an excellent vinyl pressing.  I have not listened to the CD companion yet, but the vinyl has a great bottom end thump as well very detailed soundstage.  The album may sound like a rawly produced album on the surface, but there is quite a bit going on here, especially when you crank the volume.  In short, it sounds like a classic!

0060558121|1.0|Do you remember the climactic scene at the end of Terminator II, where the metal guy was dying in the lava pit?  Where he kept going through all these faces, grasping at any shape that might have saved him?<br /><br />That's the impression I got from this book:  totally out of control and laughably silly.  It was like Gaiman had a chart of all the Gods next to his typewriter and was determined to shoehorn them into one book, torpedoes be danged!  It's the corniest plot I'm aware of:  all the different pantheons of gods battling it out at the End of Days, sometimes assuming human form, sometimes not.<br /><br />Look, if it had just been the Norse deities, that would have been a sellable plot.  Or the Egyptian.  Or Japanese.  But everybody together at once?  It may not have occurred to Gaiman that their existences were mutually contradictory (e.g., if Islamic djinn exist, then that must mean that Islam is a true religion:  but if Allah exists, no other gods can) but I wasn't.<br /><br />You know, I read this book because I had heard in a couple of places that this was the ne plus ultra of fantasy novels.  If that's true, then this is a genre that can hold nothing of value for me.

B0000062FL|5.0|This is obviously a great album.  What I'm curious about is why Sony hasn't issued a 2-CD Legacy edition of it (if they have, I've never seen it), as they have the 1st and 3rd albums (and even the more recent \\"Supernatural\\", which pales in comparison to early Santana albums).

B000AMJC2K|5.0|This is a great monitor arm except. . . the little clips they give you for \\"cord management\\" will NOT stay in the arm. Two sides are supposed to clip together through the arm to then hold the cords but with the slightest pressure they un-clip and fall out.  Also, some of the joints have infinite adjustments with a hex wrench, good. . . but one has a button that you push which then catches when you release it but only at preset points. Not so good to get that just right adjustment. But it all worked, looks good, went together easy, quality product.  Good price, free shipping.

0307474712|4.0|If each of us sat down once a year and recorded a day, the same day for twenty years, what would be the result?  Would we find a mismosh of entering and disappearing characters?  A steady trajectory towards success?  Would the friends who soared in their twenties continue to soar?<br /><br />In a \\"Same time next year, \\" format One Day follows a couple, Emma and Dexter for twenty years following college graduation.  Emma and Dexter are best friends who love each other.  Like many friends they have their ups and downs including one period of a couple of years when they do not speak.  The book follows Dexter through an easy-come-easy-go TV career and Emma, a late bloomer whose tenacity eventually pays off, though not the way that she expects.<br /><br />One thing I liked about this book was the way it shows life's unpredicability.  Almost everyone hits dead spots in their careers and relationships, times when life seems to have settled in for the duration.  And then, suddenly everything changes.  You fall in love (or maybe your spouse does.)  Someone offers you a job.  Your company goes out of busines.  Your child joins the Marines. You take up painting and someone buys one!  When you're in it life can seem far more settled than it is--but seen one day at a time for twenty years, the changes can seem remarkable.<br /><br />Em and Dexter are appealing characters.  Emma's wit carries the story even when it gets a bit bogged down.  I wasn't too happy with the end of the story as it seemed to me that the author took the easy way out,  Emm and Dexter seem far too preoccupied with age and the author seems to be under the impression that after one's 30s things are more predictable.<br /><br />Ah, is he in for a surprise!

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I'm new to PC gaming so obviously, the whole keyboard thing is taking some getting used to after 20 years of console gaming.  So, I got this thing to try and make it easier and it worked.  The hardest thing for me on a keyboard is hitting the number keys without looking down and taking my w,a,s,d fingers off but this gamepad makes everything seemingly closer and easier to find.  It might take a little re-assigning of some keys though because it's as though the whole number row on the key board has just been moved down a row, minus the q,w,e, and r keys so the rest of the numbers are else where on the pad but it's really easy to figure out.  There's also 2 buttons near the thumbstick that are so much easier to punch with your thumb then say the v or b keys on a keyboard.  I was hoping the thumbstick would feel a tad bit more like a console but the way the w,a,s,d keys are indented helps your fingers not to get lost for traditional pc movement. I know if I wanted a console experience, there's plenty of controller support, especially for newer games but lets be honest, there's no camparison when it comes to mouse aiming vs. thumbstick aiming. The mouse rules!!  So for new pc gamers who are used to consoles, this gamepad will make the transition much less painfull for your left hand.

B002ZG97RE|4.0|It seems that people in general are growing weary of any contemporary war stories.  Green Zone was marketed as another slick action thriller, but it still sort of flopped at the box office.  I was prepared for another simple, high octane popcorn flick with plenty of explosives and bullets whizzing by.  But there is a much greater purpose here than to merely entertain.  Director Paul Greengrass is sending out a startling message that hits with ferocious power.  Packed with tremendous performances, this gets my vote for the surprise action movie of the year.<br /><br />Matt Damon stars as Roy Miller, a Chief Warrant Officer on the hunt for Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq.  His frustration continues to mount as each search comes up empty.  At a debriefing, he questions the intel that keeps sending his crew on these wild goose chases.  His leaders seem pretty disinterested.<br /><br />Here's where the story gets complex, plus totally fascinating.  Loyalties and trust start to dissolve as Miller realizes he needs to take a different approach in order to make any progress.  He secretly works with a CIA agent and a Iraqi local in order to track down Al Rawi, one of Saddam's evil henchmen.<br /><br />The story advances in a gripping, believable fashion.  I especially loved the general points this movie made about the media coverage.  It is revealed that some well-respected news sources might have the facts equivalent of the tabloids.  But still the public gobbles up whatever they are serving, without any second thoughts.  The truth is often distorted and subjective.<br /><br />Green Zone has some intense action, and utilizes the hand held camera movement in order to capture the chaos and confusion of the war.  Although dizzying and ultra violent in some parts, really the pacing here is pretty controlled as it builds the story.  It makes some profound points that are hard to disregard.  Some thought provoking questions about the war.  Questions about out leaders, reasons, strategies, and consequences.  Melding fact and fiction, Greengrass studied intensively about the entire situation in the Middle East.  This movie is his springboard for voicing his conclusions.  He isn't preaching, he's providing answers and opinions.<br /><br />Michael Moore called this \\"the most honest film about the Iraqi War made by Hollywood.\\"  Overall, I enjoyed this film more than last year's Oscar winner The Hurt Locker.Melding fact and fiction, Greengrass studied intensively about the entire situation in the Middle East.

0061353248|2.0|As someone who has already knows a lot about behavioral economics, and neuro-economics, I found it very hard to get engaged in reading the book. The writing was too anecdotal, and not rigorous enough for my taste. I think that I should have saved my money, since the actual book did not add too much to the information I gained from the book reviews that I had already read.     As have other readers, I was very frustrated with the author's conclusion that since the behavior of individuals does not follow perfectly the precepts of homo economicus and individuals do not make perfect decisions, that therefore government will make better decisions. He provides no experimental data to back up his contention that government makes good decisions. What if government would make even worse decisions? Then what?!! (For those not familiar with logic, the author's conclusion is a prime example of a non sequitur.)
B001FB55HQ|5.0|I went into this flick expecting a big, fat flop.  But what I got was a suspenseful, informative movie with a driving plot, exceptional acting, and a few splashes of memories of sweet days gone by.  I am SO glad that Christian Bale signed up for this one.  His presence was the kicker.<br /><br />Many movies that are at the fourth installment are bashed by critics and slammed by the masses before they even reach the public eye.  These movies are destined to fail simply because they are preternaturally steeped in \\"sequel\\" doom and, therefore, expected to fail.  With Christian being there, you know that the entire production team was aiming for quality, and they did not disappoint.  There were many edge-of-your seat moments and plenty of pure suspense to go around.<br /><br />Even though the scene with Ah-nold in it was computer generated, it was awesome to see him again in a movie.  Actually, it was a bit bittersweet.<br /><br />Because of the success of \\"Terminator: Salvation,\\" there has been ANOTHER sequel ordered.  Let's see if they can bring it, yet, once again.<br /><br />GREAT JOB TO ALL INVOLVED!  MY TERMINATOR HAT IS OFF TO YOU!
B002ZG97RY|1.0|Hollywood and Politics seem to have an inexplicable love affair that can on occasion deliver a great film with a message or can merely deliver a message with a shoddy film. Unfortunately, this film is the latter.     As the title suggests, the film takes place shortly after the American invasion of Iraq. Saddam's retinue is scattering and take refuge within Baghdad. Matt Damon leaves an army team in search of potential sites hiding weapons of mass destruction. His character rapidly descends into trite dialogue bordering on being sanctimonious. The inteligence briefing scene containg Damon's rogue assertions the inteligence is flawed is as contrived as the weak dialogue that continues throughout the movie.     My complaint has nothing to do with the message and everything to do with the delivery. The frenetic search for non-existent WMDS through the sidealleys of Baghdad lacks realism and seems exclusively bent on Matt Damon's search to prove there are none. Forget character development or even inter-character relationships to build some story of the actual setting. The hilarious fight between special forces and matt damon's army team requires a complete suspension of reality to avoid laughing.    This will end up on TBS on Saturday mornings sandwiched between Segal B films and infomercials. Not worth the time.

The back is slightly muted clear, and clip is clear as well. It ROCKS - lightweight, solid construction, the only con is that the headphone space is too small to fully plug in your headphone plug, but you can get around it by plugging in your headphones first, then sliding the case the rest of the way on; it could be a bigger problem for people with big headphone plugs. If you want it all in one accessory, this is it - it's clear, so you can see the color your iPod is, which is the whole point of getting a color in the first place. Excellent product.

0307455874|5.0|The Audacity of Hope is a really great book. It inspires you as a person and truly displays the value of politics, particularly at a time when politics seems useless to many people. It is also rewarding to get inside the president's head and see that he really is just like all of us and he truly cares.   As a certified nurse aide, a job that requires a person to be sincerely empathetic, it is refreshing for me to read the words of a man who understands empathy better than many people. It is even more inspiring to consider that hard work, determination, and an eagerness to work with (and for) others can land a humble American into the oval office.    I highly recommend this book. It should be read by any politically-engaged American. If you have any reason to doubt Barack Obama's sincerity, read this book. If you are like me (a liberal democrat), you will probably be biased to like the book anyway, but it's nice to know more about the guy we voted for, right?
B000FC1192|5.0|I was highly impressed with Gaiman`s portrayal of the other mother and the other world. the thought of having a world that seem`s better than your`s is highlt intreauging. i would highly recomend this book.
B003EV6DBW|3.0|Like many Who fans, I began with Tom Baker. Back then the show had a pitiful budget and the cheesiest special effects imaginable. Imagine the Tardis speeding along for a crash-landing on a planet which is obviously a spinning 55 gallon drum with paper mache mountains glued on. But it didn't matter because the stories had depth and the character interactions were great. This was not an Earthbound Doctor. He was a Universal Traveling Timelord with a dog and a purpose.<br />Fast-forward to today. The Doctor has become the Protector of the Earth, surrounded by annoying incidental music and people who cannot stop talking about their feelings. This has worked OK because Peter Eccelston and David Tennant were exceptional Doctors. Matt Smith just doesn't do it for me. He doesn't suck, he's just not good enough to carry the weak scripts. I want the Doctor to get off of Earth and get invovled in stories that have some meaning and stop trying to be a sentimental action hero. Just my two cents worth...
B001SRC9P8|4.0|The book is good. But a bit too crazy at times. I literally rolled my eyes when the author revealed Maya's secret.
3836509032|5.0|I agree with the previous opinion that this book is short on text.  In addition, it is printed in multiple languages in the same edition.  (That's OK, I was not going to read it anyway)     This book is full of very interesting drawings that speak for themselves.  It is absolutely amazing that this was done before the age of computers.  The Eiffel Tower drawings from the 1890's speak a universal language and I highly recommend this book as a gift for any mechanical / technical person.    As with most coffee table books, it is oversize and not designed to fit on a shelf - put it out where people can enjoy!
B003CIG7AE|5.0|It's always interesting with music.  Here we have readers' comments that range from \\"Lame\\" to \\"Another perfect album.\\"  I'm no expert (though I do sing and play), but trust me:  This is the album you want playing in the background during your summer barbecue (unless, of course, you are the jello-shooter-turn-up-the-metal-so-we-can-really-party crowd; in which case, this won't do, I'm sure).<br /><br />I love the vocals here, and it's refreshing to hear a band who works hard on that aspect of the craft.  Bravo.  Keep it comin', Band.

0439023483|5.0|Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games draws you in from the start.  In a futuristic society, where teens are plucked randomly from a drawing to participate in a fight-to-their-death televised reality game, sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, an unlikely heroine rises out of obscurity to become the star and winner of the Games.  Along the way, she discovers who to trust and who to love.  An incredible fast-paced read.  You get drawn into this world and the Game.  One of the best books I've read recently.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|This is an awesome movie. I had to buy it again because the first DVD had gotten all scratched up. It's a must see.
B00275EGWY|3.0|The movie itself was entertaining, and I'd say overall it was a good movie; however, why did they have to jiggle the camera around so much -- and zoom in and out? I get what they're trying to do: give it that gritty type of feel. But sometimes the camera just zooms in on a shot, and then zooms back out -- maybe even back in. And then half the time, the camera is jiggling around on the shots. For me, I have to look away sometimes just so my stomach calms down.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|I'd never heard Madeleine Peyroux before, but had heard of her through friends.  She has a wide, open voice, reminiscent of K. D. Lang.  Nothing was expected, I was delighted with the sound.  Her voice is intelligent and sensual.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Sci-fi the way I like it; this movie combines the Sixth Sense with the Matrix and Batman Begins and creates a whole new hybrid of movie within movie within movie schematics that will leave simple-minded viewers being wowed with the action, and deeper-thinkers pondering the logistics of the entire movie.<br /><br />The two-and-a-half hours flew by in the blink of an eye for me, and I will willingly see this movie again, and soon, to attempt to piece together a few parts that eluded me the first time.<br /><br />The acting and visuals are top-notch, and the idea behind the story is worthy of Neil Gaiman.
B002ZCDR88|1.0|The problem with this album is that these are children's poems and have a rhyming cadence to them. While the melody and timbres change, the poem cadence makes all the songs sound similar. Disappointing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD.  Jillian's tough style is very motivating.  No squeaky high-pitched voice like some of the other instructors that drive me nuts.  The music has a great beat that gets you moving even before the exercises begin.  I don't have the problem with mandatory advertisements like those mentioned in some other reviews.  I watched them the first time, now just hit \\"menu\\", select my workout and I am in.  I am still on Level One after after a few weeks as it is still plenty hard.  Your heart rate will be super high and you will sweat like crazy.  I like the way she mixes cardio in with the strength exercises.  More interesting that the normal workouts that split them into two separate phases.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|The series as a whole was full of suspense, surprise, and mystery, interlaced with element of science fiction and religion.  The final season seemed to become a \\"love it or hate it\\" season for the fans, as many awaited answers to the mind-boggling mysteries of this show, and others waited for the resolution to their favorite characters' stories.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, I highly recommend this product.  The journey ends at a high point for this show, and while it definitely leaves plenty up to interpretation, it is a very well-acted and written show.<br /><br />If you like to look for the deeper meaning in things, you'll love this season of LOST.  If you like up-front answers and reasons for the major plots and twists, you will be disappointed.
0736092269|5.0|I found this book very informative on learning the various muscles that may come into play while working out.  Since i am a Doctor of Chiropractic this will be a helpful book to memorize the various muscle groups in the human body.    Damon E. Monty, DC/CFT/FT/SSC
B000001A3H|5.0|If you like hard rock/heavy metal and you haven't tried Kyuss, you really need to check them out.  Given the skills of this band and all the great songs they've put out, I am not quite sure why Kyuss didn't enjoy a lot more success than they did.  Kyuss was just getting started when hair rock was dying and grunge was entering the scene, so I think Kyuss was drowned out by the Nirvana and Pearl Jam craze.  That's unfortunate, because this band is brilliant.    Blues for the Red Sun is Kyuss' second album, and the best of all their work.  Guitar sensation Josh Homme was 19 years old when this album came out. His guitar skills at this age are impressive, but what blows my mind is his amazing songwriting ability. Everyone contributes and works well together, with Garcia's raw vocals fitting perfectly, Oliveri's bass coming through loud and strong, and Bjork's great drum work. They have a unique sound unlike any other band, which is a feat for rock bands of that era.  They have a very raw and honest sound and don't attempt to write any particular type of song or target any particular audience; they just create the kind of authentic music they love to play.    Five of my favorite ten Kyuss songs are on Blues (2 on Wretch, 2 on Sky Valley, 1 on Circus).  \\"Thumb\\" is probably Kyuss' best and most popular song and it really represents their music well. A very close second is \\"Allen's Wrench,\\" one of Kyuss' hardest songs, an absolute tumult of organized noise that no metal fan can resist. \\"Freedom Run\\" is an epic track that grows on you the more you listen to it.  Kyuss released \\"Green Machine\\" of this album, a straight-forward in-your-face song about greed with a catchy riff.  Don't overlook \\"50 Million Year Trip\\" either, where they break it down into a slow heavy chorus.  The instrumental tracks are great as well, with \\"Apothecary's Weight\\" and \\"Caterpillar's March\\" being two of their best.    If you're going to check out Kyuss, Blues for the Red Sun is your best place to start. If you like it as much as I do, you'll go out and buy everything else this much underrated band has to offer.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is an outstanding HBO miniseries based on the late-historian Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name.  It follows the officers and men of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment as they fight their way across Nazi-occupied Europe from their terrifying jump into Normandy on D-Day, to their defense of Bastogne, to their triumphant capture of Hitler's \\"Eagle's Nest\\" at Berchtesgarten.  Filled with action, the series also captures the pain of losing comrades, the horror of war wounds, the occasional boredom of war, and the crucial role of excellent leadership in combat.  This is a must-see series.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Inception is one of the more enjoyable films that I have seen in some time. It falls somewhere between the Matrix (methodology), Vanilla Sky (multi-layered realities) and the Usual Suspects (densely-plotted, begs more than one viewing.)    The result is a thrill-ride that will leave most viewers pondering long after the credits have rolled. It is both provocative and at times mesmerizing, albeit a bit over-thought at times.    Though the idea of \\"dream hacking\\" is hardly new, Nolan's layers to the idea make the concept seem quite fresh and the result is something unique. Instead of relying on one \\"plane\\" of consciousness or dreamscape, Nolan has included \\"levels\\", which dictate different levels of a dream and each team member has a role to serve in navigating its murky and at times unnerving landscape to accomplish their mission. Timing is critical at every level and the story is weaved together rather well, though at times it can feel a little overwhelming.    In fact, the only complaint I have about the film is that at certain moments it bogs down under the weight of its own complexity and at times, unnecessarily.    Part of this is because Nolan is a little unconventional in terms of how he handles exposition. Instead of laying out the rules of the world in one part of the film, he chooses to add more rules as the film progresses.    In a more conventional scenario, consider the Matrix:    1. First part, we are as disoriented as Neo and do not understand what is happening.     2. Second part, the rules of the world are laid out by Morpheus and suddenly we understand what is happening.     3. Finally, the action takes place with the audience in the full know of the established rules.    With Inception, these rules unfold throughout almost the entire film, much like the plot points. The result is a double-edged sword: On one hand, it keeps the film moving swiftly and you continue to have \\"ah-ha\\" moments. On the other hand, it makes one feel like scorekeeping is inorder to keep everything straight as you watch it.    It's not so much that Nolan gives us TOO MUCH INFORMATION, as much as it that he gives us CRITICAL PIECES OF INFORMATION in VERY SMALL WINDOWS of screen time. This means one ill-timed bathroom break could compromise your entire understanding of the film.     Even paying strict attention the entire time, there are still times when details lost because we're too busy absorbing info.     Another common complaint is the \\"ambiguous ending\\", which has sparked raging debates. I personally don't mind such endings. I like coming to my own conclusions, but that's just me. Unfortunately though, I found more ambiguous moments throughout the entire film, which doesn't work as well. Again, the \\"rules\\" get fuzzy at times, which one should always be avoided when doing science fiction, especially as layered as this.    That being said, you still feel like you've seen a \\"complete film\\" at the end, and it should resonate one way or another, good or bad. No one and I mean NO ONE can dispute Nolan's ambition here. It's one of the most ambitious concepts and films I've seen in years.    PERFORMANCES    I don't consider myself a huge DiCaprio fan. I love much of his early work but don't remember him in a memorable role since Titanic (I have not yet seen Shudder Island, which I am told he is good in.) I thought he was very strong here, with much of Nolan's script playing to his strengths.    Supporting performances were exactly what I expected -- nothing Oscar worthy, but perfectly capable. Cillian Murphy is teamed up with Nolan again, and serves his character well. I feared Ellen Page would be a weak link in the film, but I was wrong. Also refreshing were the performances of lesser known talents such as Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe and Dileep Rao. Michael Caine also has a small part and it's always good to see him.    My biggest disappointment was Marion Cotillard, who I thought was rather one-dimensional here. But that may have been more of a symptom of her role.     CINEMATOGRAPHY    In standard Nolan fashion, Inception is generally gorgeous and well- shot. I love the fact that Nolan relies less on CGI than the average Hollywood director and still understands the value of organic action, scenes and stunts.    MUSIC    Frankly, I was under whelmed with the score, but less because of the score itself and more so because it seems too loud and overwhelming at times. There were even times when I couldn't even hear dialogue. This is either a mixing/editing problem OR possibly because I was sitting at the back of my theater and it seemed too loud.    That complaint aside, the heavy dramatic cuts that prevail in the film are effective and add to the scenes.    IN CONCLUSION    I found Inception to be exciting and captivating, and easily one of the better films of 2010. Where does it rank among the all time greats? I cannot say. I do consider it a top-flight science fiction film, but I struggle to think of it as a cinematic masterpiece because I really do think it out-thought itself on too many occasions.    Do I suggest you go see it? Absolutely, no questions asked. In parting I'll leave you with....    RECOMMENDATION FOR FIRST TIME VIEWERS:    1. The first 10-15 minutes are a little disorienting. Be patient, things will fall into place soon enough.    2. As mentioned above, try and avoid bathroom breaks. It really can be the difference.    3. Sit in the middle or front of the theater. As mentioned above, either by design or because of my theater, the music was too loud at times and dialogue was lost.    4. Be prepared to be absorbing a lot of input. You won't have much time to process that input until the film is over.
B003JR1JV0|1.0|Her voice quality doesn't come through on this at all, and its too bad that as she is looking for a more mature audience-- she thinks she has to go for the \\"rebel\\" look and sound.  I would much rather see her mature and grow as a young successful and confident professional and try to keep some of the fan base she already has.  There are one or two good songs on this, but definitely not worth buying the cd.
B0006OBPTA|4.0|For those that grew up in the 80's, these are a must-have nostalgia collection!  First two are top notch, with the third one coming in as just ok ('bad guy' & 'love interest girl' really did a poor job of acting), with the 4th a nice finish to the series.  Worth the price I paid for it so I'm happy with the purchase!
B0035TMUTM|5.0|Great variety from various albums over the years including the earlier ones, along with remixes. Some of the tracks in this collection are incredibly beautiful, while others have a rave/techno quality, and still others cannot be easily categorized. I listen to this while writing and doing creative work as it puts my mind into an alpha state...no thinking, just grooving to the complex and rolling journey of sound. It is a rush.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|A spectacular movie.  The performances of both Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend are winsome and engaging, giving strong testimony to the long-lasting and precious love story that has captivated millions and will continue to do so.  Their's was a reign of love, which we are privy to through this wonderful, touching movie.  It deserves a wide audience and much recognition.  This brilliantly decadent and stunningly visual banquet of a movie will continue to enrapture and provide enjoyment for many.  I hope it is watched again and again, a must-have for any avid history and movie buff.  5 stars.
B000VI04HK|2.0|This is a puzzling release.  The audio portion is pretty good, with a mix of new songs (the ones from Around the Sun are much better here than on that record) and old classics.  It's mixed well, it gives a good reprsentation of how this great band really sounds in its live shows.  What's weird is that they pack almost all the songs on one CD, then just put 5 songs on the other.  For a band that thinks of itself as environmentally conscious, that strikes me as odd.    The packaging is pretty ordinary--no liner notes to speak of, and not much by way of photos or anything.    The video is just awful.    I get a headache trying to watch it.  I don't think I've ever made it through the whole thing, except once when I fell asleep three songs in.  It cuts around from one angle to the next at seemingly random intervals. I'm sure there's something Artistic I just don't understand here, but it's difficult to watch without getting seasick.    So, I'd give the CDs 3.5 stars, the video 0.5 stars, and 2 stars overall it is.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|First, although this documentary was just released last year it already has a dated feel to it, as governmental regimes have changed but not the greedy profit motive that drives the capitalist economy and which the twin governmental parties of capitalism, Republican and Democratic, each in their way, serve. Moore's main object at the time, I assume, was to take advantage, easy advantage as the case turned out, of the villainous characters that ran the capitalist government under President Bush, under whose regime all economic hell broke loose. That was then, and this is now though. The easily interchangeable cast of characters now look remarkable the same, the wars the same, unemployment still at modern day highs, Wall Street bonuses obscene, Congress still  under the thumb (as Moore, in his great film-making capacity, really captures)  under new \\"go to\\" guy Obama. Sure, plenty of people had (and still have) plenty of illusions in Obama so Brother Moore was not alone, although some of the others had enough sense not to film their glee for the world to see and  thus have to shield their faces from public view  when the inevitable shoe fell.<br /><br />Second, one of the central motifs here is Moore's notion that this country can turn itself around by going back to some form of Rooseveltian \\"New Deal (his Second Bill Of Rights). But his big push is for social and political action by the \\"little people.\\" (Called by Moore, and others, the middle class, although it is really called the working class, brother, at least from the film footage interviews from such towns as Detroit and Cleveland. There is nothing wrong with calling a thing by its right name, okay?) Moore makes several plugs (including at the end) for people to \\"do something.\\"  Unfortunately, such a vague statement in politics can be turned on you. In a racist-tinged, anti-immigrant, starve public services (part of which is directed at those same two groups) \\"Age of the Tea Party\\", political action by the \\"little people\\" is not always without a program, a socialist program, the kind of clarion call to action that he was looking for. So political programmatic clarity, always in short supply with Moore, is a must.<br /><br />Finally, although I didn't notice it as much on the first viewing Moore's worldview is informed by an almost Catholic Workers movement-like (formed in the old Great Depression days by  Dorothy Day and others, and later included followers like the Berrigan brothers and many ex-priests and ex-nuns) sensibility. Now, as I, perhaps, have mentioned before Dorothy Day was revered in my childhood home, especially by my devout, pious poor mother. So I can thus sense, as that spark also drove part of my own social education, the origins of  the quest for justice in Moore's work, if not for his conclusions. But Brother Moore that was long ago, and I was just I kid. Grownups fight, and fight hard, under a more progressive banner than the Democrats offer, or ever offered.
B002T921AC|1.0|This is absolutely ridiculous, the music industry creates yet ANOTHER empty, cheeky, polished piece of work..Music is on the brinks of death. And the only way to save it is to stop buying meaningless, worthless (music industry needs a dollar) music like this. He is a cheap throwaway. This music is about as valuable as Gucci Mane himself. As long as people keep buying these albums, the value and true art in music is in for a fatal fall. Everything is digitalized and computerized, that you almost dont need any singing talent. Just an image.  This kid has no skill. Heck, he's probably a cool son of a gun, but a waste in the music industry
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Great CD!!  Enjoy it regularly - and as usual - great, fast service from Amazon!!
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Best Petty album since Wildflowers, and the best Heartbreakers album in a long, long while. If you're the kind of Petty fan who is more inclined to play their greatest hits CD, this might not be for you. But if you appreciate his catalog beyond just the countless, brilliant singles like Free Falling, Mary Jane's Last Dance, American Girl, etc (and these all constitute a very real element of the dude's brilliance) .. definitely buy this CD.    I've been a Petty fan for over thirty years, and while he's received his fair share of critical acclaim, he's also been dissed by self-proclaimed \\"sophisticated\\" music fans. Give this CD a listen .. a careful listen several times. Listen to the hooks, the melodies, the writing, and the way that this ensemble continues to prove themselves the least selfish, supremely talented band in pop music today. Benmont Tench apparently enjoyed the Mudcrutch sessions and touring so much that he wished they'd cut a second LP and toured again. This is about as good a compromise as he might have hoped for .. the band playing for themselves, Tom on top of his writing game without being overly concerned about penning an instant-airplay single, and the drawing power of a band that can sell out huge arenas in minutes. (Although truth be told, I'd much prefer to see them in a small venue as when they played San Francisco's Fillmore back in the 90s, and have them do this entire album and not just four or five cuts.)    It's ironic that the same thing that propelled Petty over the top - his ability to write catchy, occasionally ephemeral pop hits that have it in spades over typical top 10 pablum yet manage to hold the public's popular imagination - is also what has caused him to suffer the derision of some nose-up Robyn Hitchcock types. This selection of tunes is a stellar example of what they've been missing.
0812550706|3.0|I gave this item 3 stars entirely because of the shape that it was in. The company sent me the product in an extremely quick manner. They described the item as used but in good shape.

0380977273|5.0|Originally released in the early 1960s, Ray Bradbury's \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" reads as fresh as any dark fantasy novel or horror piece written today, and it's as well written as the best of the genre, Stephen King and Dean Koontz and the like.<br /><br />The story in this novel starts off quite simply. There's a small town. In the middle of the night a train rolls into town and a carnival unloads itself off the train. Two young boys become interested and begin sneaking around the carnival at night, as young boys are likely to do. But then weird things begin happening in town.<br /><br />I won't say any more about the plot, because it would give too much away.<br /><br />But the writing here is great, flows easily and is full of awe-inspiring moments and some laughter. The darkness of this tale is not visually grotesque, so this is a perfect story for both adults and young adults. Even children nearing the teen years could enjoy this book.<br /><br />As far as a theme or subtext, \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" focuses a lot on age, on the young seeking their dreams, and the old wishing for dreams that had never come to fruition. The relationships between fathers and sons is also a main feature of this story.<br /><br />Read it, you'll love it. It's definitely a classic.
B0038VPB5W|5.0|`Fever' is the third album by Welsh heavy metal band `Bullet for my valentine'. This 2010 release was my introduction to the band and a very positive surprise overall; music wise the band has been labeled anything from metalcore to trash metal to heavy metal to melodic metal. I have to approach this release under the heavy/melodic prism simply because I do not have substantial experience in the other metal subgenres mentioned previously.<br /><br />From the first track to the last it all sounded very familiar with a very strong reference to classic and melodic heavy metal. When the opening track `Your betrayal' kicked in with that super heavy/classic metallic instrumentation I got excited and by the time the vocal line `I was told to stay away-those two words I can't obey' I was completely sold! I knew that regardless of what kind of metal this is, I enjoyed it! The following track `Fever' also rides on the back of some furious but classic heavy metal riff, built on lyrical themes of sexual attraction while also demonstrating a glamorous chorus that brings to mind hair/sleaze metal. The third track `The last fight' turned out to be the most melodic, still relatively simple, direct and therefore substantial; once again laying some infectious vocal lines such as `Should I fight for what is right or let it die?'. By that time I knew I would be playing the album to death throughout the following weeks.<br /><br />Performance wise, there is sporadic inclusion of brutal vocals mainly underlining clean vocal lines during the choruses but for the biggest part of `Fever' I was incredibly surprised to find out that not only are the vocals clean but the are totally melodic; in fact amongst the most melodic I have ever heard.<br /><br />In all fairness I bought the album in an attempt to familiarize myself with a band and musical style I knew very little about, therefore I expected the process of playing `Fever' to be long, tiring and controversial; yet on the contrary, I came across, a straightforward, direct and pretty melodic heavy metal album; of course I could trace that modern flavor that was to be found at some part of each song but by and large what I hear was the traditional heavy melodic sound that I have come to love over the years.<br /><br />`Fever' was probably the surprise of 2010 for me, possibly the album I've played the most over the past few months being definitely one of the most infectious sources of metal melody out there at the moment.<br /><br />`Metal Hammer' Greek Magazine (issue 307) marks this album with 8/10 commenting: \\"Fever is one of the most artistic and original albums I've heard up to this point for 2010\\".tforward, direct and pretty melodic heavy metal album; of course I could trace that modern flavor that was to be found at some part of each song but by and large what I hear was the traditional heavy melodic sound that I have come to love over the years.     `Fever' was probably the surprise of 2010 for me, possibly the album I've played the most over the past few months being definitely one of the most infectious sources of metal melody out there at the moment.        `Metal Hammer' Greek Magazine (issue 307) marks this album with 8/10 commenting: \\"Fever is one of the most artistic and original albums I've heard up to this point for 2010\\".
B0002HYHBE|5.0|We have a German au pair who brought this game over with her. I have twins that are just 3 and they love this game. They play it several times a day! At this point they can even set it up themselves. They love to be able to pick up the fruit and put it in their baskets. My only concern is losing the small fruits but I kept the information that it came with and I guess you can order more. One of the girls also stepped on the basket, they are not as durable as I would hope but again easy to replace I suppose.   I was so happy to see that I can find this game in the US because I plan on buying it for my friends children.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Este es un DVD unico, magico y extraordinario. Para mi opinion EL MEJOR DVD sobre una presentacion de McCartney. IMAGENES PERFECTAMENTES DIRIGIDAS Y COMPAGINADAS, un extraordinario AUDIO, un carisma unico. No solo lo memorable de ver a Paul a sus 68 a;os activo como nunca, sino que este concierto se disfruta desde principio hasta el fin , sin esos cortes que venian integrando los ultimos conciertos en vivo editados por McCartney que te impedia darle todo el volumen al equipo de sonido. Aqui te sentiras como en primera fila, con una seleccion de temas tan agradables que solo los puedo comparar con los conciertos de Wings Over America, que hasta este era mi preferido.  Sientes que los temas se han actualizado sin perder su escencia, MUCHO ROCK, mucho Macca.    100% RECOMENDABLE, espero que lo disfruten tanto como yo    WILLIAM DUGARTE  CARACAS-Venezuela
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Tried to watch this movie on Netflix but the DVD was so bad I had to send it back mostly unwatched.  But what I did see made me realize it was worth buying. I have enjoyed this movie so much, and recommended it to all my family and friends.  Wish I had seen it at the theater.  The animation is state of the art and the actor/voices really made this movie come alive.
0316067601|5.0|I received the product very quickly and it was in excellent shape for an awesome price. The book was recommended to me by a friend and it was easily one of the best books I've ever read. Thanks for the great service!
B00092ZL80|3.0|This is a so-so DVD.  There are about four or five songs that sound good.  Chicago without Cetera is less than enjoyable.
B002ZG997M|3.0|Denzel is one of my favorite actors. This movie had a unique perspective but lacked substance. Entertaining with a twist at the end. Watch Training Day. The more you watch it the better it gets. I did watch this movie twice to pick up on the little things I missed the first time.
630463949X|5.0|One of the best DVD's I've seen, if you like Fleetwood Mac at all, you will be amazed...Buy it!!
0091933684|5.0|Great receipes, fabulous pictures and easy instructions make this book a winner.  I am not a vegan and I purchased this book due to an article I read in the British version of House & Garden.  WATERMELON & FETA - wonderful!

B003L16FAE|5.0|This will be my first time posting something that I bought from Amazon. I will not be talking about the movie, as you already know that this is a freakin awesome movie. I pre-order this and got it just after a week of the release and watch it immediately on my PS3. And boi I was really amazed with the clarity of this version. The transfer for this edition is really amazing and superb with a wonderful audio transfer as well. I have the DVD version of this movie as was able to see the difference. So, I will surreally recommend this edition if you are still wondering how is the quality of the transfer compared to then the previous release which sucked. Dun think much and order this immediately, its really worth it. Amazing release for a even more amazing movie. Add to cart now!!!!    Note: Ensure you get yr firmware update before you see this movie, as it will not be clear if you do not update to the latest firmware. I saw some green lines first and when I update my PS3 firmware and the line was not there and it was so much clearer.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I have been a Maiden fan since the beginning, and this album really offers up some of the most interesting and intricate musical work to date.  I particularly liked the 3/4 time signature in several songs, most specifically the title track.  Maiden is very adept at changing time signatures in their songs, and this album was probably them at their best creatively - sure, the Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, Powerslave trilogy will be among my favorite albums, but this album really has it all and then some.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This edition is what you saw in the cinema.  We loved it, we believed it, and we discussed the themes.  Sure, this is barebones, but it is relatively less expensive.  This is our first blu-ray dvd, and it lived up to expectations.  But really, this film is a matter of personal taste:  either it speaks to you, or it doesn't.  Warmly recommended.
B0039UTDFG|5.0|The order, and delivery were fast and effecient. The product works fine as I would expect.
B003L16FAE|1.0|I wouldn't wish this Hunter Edition \\"on a broke-dick dog.\\" If this 2010 BD is better than the 2008 BD, \\"then I'm a god damn chinaman.\\" This new edition doesn't look good at all. I agree that it looks too plastic and fake. The scenes that stand out the most are: the briefing scene where faces looks really waxy and phony & the waterfall scene where Arnold is swimming through plastic wrap or vaseline. Fox made some scenes way too smooth. Whoever \\"remastered\\" this Predator H.E. should be FIRED! Look closely at your HDTV screen!!! The film is NOT clearer, sharper, or more \\"HD like.\\" This 2010 Ed is Fuzzy and blurry!!<br /><br />In the very beginning, the water looks like a big melting candle and the trees look plastic (like they're from Toys R Us or part of some kid's diorama for school). Arnold's face looks like a Ken Doll. Again, there is less detail in this BD and more blurry images.<br /><br />I compared this H.E. to the 2008 edition. Although there is grain in the 08' version, it is not that bad. The 08' PQ is average and didn't distract me from enjoying Predator. H.E. will distract you from watching Predator. In the old BD when Arnold is swimming in the water ... it actually looks like water. In the 2010 U.H.E. BD When Dutch throws his knife into the enemy's chest and says \\"stick around\\" ... the knife looks phony and plastic!!!<br /><br />The fine detail is better in the 08' edition. In the 08' BD you can see facial details & Arnold's muscles look real and not like scoops of ice cream. The grain is only heavy in 3 or 4 scenes (the part when Dutch tells Mac to set the trip wires and then they talk about Blain - the close up on Mac is extremely grainy). I can live with a few grainy scenes, but not wax figures. If I wanted to see wax figures then I would go to Madame Tussauds Wax Museum in Timesquare. This ULTIMATE DNR EDITION belongs next to Schwarzenegger's wax figure.<br /><br />I would rather watch a movie with some grain then an over smoothed out film. Some partsin the ULTIMATE DNR EDITION look so crappy. Arnold's face looks like a cartoon at times. I only bought this for the Movie Money ($10). The manager at the theater let me watch it for free (I didn't pay the difference). Ticket was $12.50 & at the time I bought this BD for $14, so I basically got this for $1.50 which is exactly how much this is worth. Predator is one of my favorite movies of all time and it is a shame how Fox has abused this movie. Fox keeps spitting in the faces of Predator fans.<br /><br />To the people who wine, moan, and complain about film grain: Stop watching classic movies then!!! Throw out all of your DVDs. You can watch all of the new garbage that Hollywood is cranking out non-stop ... enjoy all the shiny new trash. I WOULD RATHER WATCH THE DVD THAN THIS \\"Hunter Edition\\" TRASH!!!<br /><br />Hell, I would rather watch a gently used VHS on a standard def TV than this garbage excuse for a BD!!!<br /><br />Buy the 2008 Predator Blu-ray instead of this Ultimate DNR Trash.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0012GVKW8 Predator [Blu-ray]]]
B00028HBKM|1.0|I have never been a Mel Gibson fan, either as an actor or a director, although he has a wonderful eye for panorama and the use of lush color in his movies.  But, since I enjoyed \\"Apocalypto\\" in spite of its problems (which any film painting on such a large canvas is likely to have), I finally decided to watch this much-hyped film.  I was appalled.      The story of the Passion is relatively brief, but powerful, whether or not you accept its literal truth.  This film reduced its potency to an orgy of sado-masochistic exhibitionism with anti-Semitic embellishments.  \\"Jews\\" are depicted as a faceless, howling mob lusting for sacred blood, some going so far to visit the site of the execution to gloat like comic-opera villains, something Jews of the time would have never done, places of execution being ritually unclean.  Further, the \\"Satan\\" of the Gesthemane scene was equally problematic, a malevolent, androgyne cross between Klaus Nomi and Udo Kier.  Gibson clearly sets his fey and urbane devil against the \\"muscular\\" Christ in what I thought was yet another Gibson indulgence of the tired, emasculated \\"homosexual evil\\" construct. Never mind that Satan, in the actual Passion story, never puts in an appearance.  And these are fairly representative problems in what is, essentially, a two-hour long snuff film where the \\"Sermon on the Mount\\" is reduced to one line, swallowed up by loving, gratuitous shots of Roman punishments and execution methods.  Indeed, if the movie has any value, it lies in a faithful reproduction of how Romans treated people who ran afoul of their rule.  But as is, it takes the clear prejudices of the film-maker, slathers them with gore, and lays them on the flayed back of the unimpressive Jim Caveziel who - I hope - was very well paid for his efforts, at least.      If this is a subject that interests you, I would recommend \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told.\\"  True, it is very long and can get very dry, but at least it tries to be as comprehensive as the historical record allows, and you actually hear the words of Christ as opposed to his shrieks.  But the only \\"Passion\\" in this film has less to do with Christ than the turgid, dripping, dark obssessions of its maker.        No recommendation.
B0035VFLI2|5.0|I'm not a huge rockabilly fan but this is different.<br />The songs are good but what I think makes this album great is the band.<br />Derek Bossanova's piano is something of a mix between Jerry Lee Lewis and a coked up Thelonius Monk. It's equal parts, eerie, surprising and possibly violent.<br />I can't help but wonder what else this guy has done and why I haven't heard of him until now.<br /><br />Curran's vocals were confusing at first but then I figured something out... the record came out exactly like he envisioned it. I don't think most rock n rollers are smart enough to produce themselves, but Curran and Billy Horton make this a classic record and I intend to enjoy it for a long time.
0307463745|1.0|Mike Chamberlain's REWORK is an opinion based book with very weak examples and no practical advice on how to achieve real goals.  On two occasions he gave advice that was a direct contradiction of the seven habits of highly effective people.  I cringed as Chamberlain made foolish or painfully obvious statements throughout this book.  Some examples are as follow:    \\"Forget formal education... There are plenty of intelligent people who don't excel in the classroom.\\"  --There are more that do excel in the classroom, and those that don't gain more out of school in their struggle as they learn to establish work ethic, fortitude and self-discipline.  Chamberlain is unable to grasp the difference between creativeness and intelligence.--    \\"Marketing is not a department\\"  --Oh good you can explain this to several companies that I work with that doubled there profits in less then two years after establishing a marketing team.  His advice is often only relevant to his niche.--    \\"Never hire anyone unless you tried it yourself first\\"   --My company recently needed a bioengineer, should myself or anyone else in the company attempt to do the required task without the education and experience, I think not.  A company should create a team to compensate for it's weaknesses.--    \\"It makes no sense to tell everyone to look at you when you are not ready to be looked at.\\"   --Yes, this called humility.--    \\"Emulate the drug dealer.\\"  -- Chamberlain tries to connect a drug dealers giving away samples of their drugs to that of icecream shops that give tastes of ice cream and car dealerships that give test drives.  Think about that analogy for a minute.--    The list goes on and Chamberlain provides band aid fixes to serious defects in character such as a lack of temperance, fortitude and humility, all of which are qualities of many millionaires who through their work created hundreds of jobs and stimulated the American economy.      If you really want your personal life and businessto succeed, the most practical books to read are: \\"MAKING THINGS HAPPEN\\" by Scott Belsky and \\"7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE\\" by Stephen R. Covey.  Good luck to everyone!
B002RVZV9K|3.0|The director clearly has an infatuation for Jack White, since he gets more screen time than Jimmy Page or Edge, almost more than them combined.  This is unfortunate, since I think he's the least talented, least interesting, and most pretentious of the trio.  In a way, I felt a bit cheated, since very little of the film reflects the promotional aspect - the three of them sitting together and discussing their varied approaches to making music.  That material can be found (and not nearly enough of it for my liking) in some of the DVD extras, which I found more interesting than the cut film itself.  It's worth a watch, but unless you're a Jack White fan, prepare to be a bit disappointed.

0060888709|5.0|I had two purposes, prompted by the 50th anniversary of publication.     1. Is the book worth reading (or hearing) for those of us who haven't read it for many years, if not decades? Answer: absolutely. The novel is still wonderful, with such finely drawn, memorable characters in a story that is straightforward and easy to understand in its morals and message.    2. How is the narration by Sissy Spacek and does the novel work while listening in the car? Ms. Spacek is excellent, with her acting talent applied generously. I have no idea whether she had to work at the Alabama sound, but to this Yankee she did not sound unnatural at all, including presentation of young Scout and Jem. Even without demonstrating exceptional range in distinguishing among the characters, I really liked the pacing and general sound. Drive-time fiction can be a challenge when there is mystery and suspense, as \\"can't put it down\\" could be problematic. In this case, I already knew the basics of what would happen, so calling it quits and picking up later was ok.

0786852550|4.0|When I read the synopsis for The Amulet of Samarkand, I was largely expecting another Harry Potter clone or something of the same general ilk.  Within the first couple of chapters, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book has plenty of unique qualities that set it apart from the current kids fantasy books I've read lately.    One of the first things I came to enjoy was the overall tone of the writing.  The author has broken the story out into two main categories and alternates between them....The categories are the point of view and voice.  One segment will be from the point of view of Bartimeus, the very old, very talented, and very sarcastic djinn who has been summoned for what he suspects will be a menial task of an underage magician.  The other segment is from the point of view of that underage magician, Nathaniel, who is young, somewhat naive as to the way things work in his society, and very passionate.      The alternating voices provide an engaging counterbalance in the story and also add tension and intrigue as we, the readers, learn things from one narrator that will potentially affect the other narrator who is currently \\"off stage.\\"    The storyline is engaging as well.  It takes place in a (presumably) contemporary England in which magic users are a sort of elite class.  Unlike the Harry Potter world, magicians are not hiding from the non-magic-users.  Instead, they are integrated into commerce, politics and other elements of society.  There is a definite distinction between magic-users and non-magic-users, but the distinction is one of class and power rather than one of secrecy.    While the book/trilogy is named after Bartimaeus, the plot revolves around Nathaniel and the various events during his apprenticeship.  He is apprenticed to a fairly inept and almost non-present master.  Nathaniel has good teachers and a strong passion to learn, so he actually engages in his own self-paced learning by sneaking into his master's books and devouring all the knowledge he can.      At first this extra knowledge/talent looks like it will be a great boon for him when he is first introduced to other magicians.  But after being put down, he seeks revenge through a fairly small prank for which he is punished.  This punishment in turn increases his desire for revenge, and the downward spiral continues out of control (enter Bartimaeus, the Amulet from the title, murder, political intrigue, and more trouble than Nathaniel bargains for).    The writing style is smooth and easy to follow.  I especially liked the Bartimaeus segments for his snarky voice and hilarious footnotes.  The plot is interesting and flowed nicely, revealing the nuances and tension bit by bit until the powder keg is ready to explode.    I really enjoyed this new take on the children/youth fantasy market.  I am curious to see the direction the rest of the trilogy takes.  I suspect it will be just as entertaining.    ****  4 out of 5 stars

0439023491|5.0|I read the Hunger Games a couple of months ago.  I really enjoyed the adventure, the struggle, the characters and the world created.  The novel ended in such a way that the current conflict was wrapped up but it was evident that the real troubles had only just begun.<br /><br />And that's where Catching Fire picks things up.  Going into this second book, I was excited to see what direction the story would take.  I enjoyed the first book but felt like a lot of the intrigue and dynamics of the world of Panem were kept at a distance because of the immense in-your-face presence of the Games.  I'm not saying that as a bad thing...presenting the Games as such an amazing force created huge tension in the first book.  I also acknowledge that there was plenty of information given as to the nature of the government and the leaders, enough that it was very evident what kind of a world this was.<br /><br />In Catching Fire, however, the first ~half of the book gives us a deeper and wider view of just how despicable this government is, beyond the annual Hunger Games.  We're shown nearly a full year of life outside the games.  And we don't only see the harsh conditions as they existed before the Games of the first book, but we see the added hatred, violence and propaganda that come as an aftermath of those Games.<br /><br />The characters are well portrayed and seem deeper than before.  We get VERY up-close-and-personal with President Snow (and I would add that the author does an excellent job of creating deep disgust towards him...I shudder whenever he entered a scene).  We get more involved and in-the-heads of the characters we'd known from the first book.  And we quickly find ourselves racing alongside vibrantly real new characters.<br /><br />I felt that the drama, suspense and tension created was very well done.  My emotions were thrown about many times as things went from bad to worse to awful to 'how will they ever get out of this.'  Of all the pivotal/surprise moments, I only really predicted one of them (probably the most obvious of the bunch...the one where Pres. Snow opens and reads the notice about the quell).  Because of the nature of the society and the rules, it was believable that the characters would have been surprised by that moment even when I saw it coming.  The other elements were very surprising and provided me with either a lot of suspense and tension or surprise and relief...whichever was dictated by the situation.  In other words, the twists and turns did exactly what they were supposed to.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book a lot.  In terms of action and adventure, it started out a little bit slow but even then the beginning was very interesting to me as it really fleshed out the nature of the society and laid a very intricate framework.  I've heard a lot of talk about the \\"romance\\" factor here.  There were plenty of moments where the reader is reminded of the romantic tension and the 'love triangle' in play here.  However, the romance factor is kept where it belongs in a story like this...off to the side.  The love story plays an important part, but when you consider the severe dystopian world and the threats, violence, suspense and tension all around, this is hardly the world where a strong romantic love story will flourish.  I think the author did a great job keeping the romantic element alive with just the right amount of strength to make it believable.<br /><br />After finishing the book, a comparison came to mind...that of the original trilogy of Star Wars films (New Hope, Empire and Jedi).  In terms of character, plot and world development, I see this book series following an arc very similar to the way those three movies developed.  At the end of this second book, we're left with an 'acceptable' closure to the book but the promise of a lot more adventure and a huge confrontation to come.  I now join the ranks of those anxiously awaiting the release of Mockingjay later this year.<br /><br />Final verdict...read this series.  I enjoyed the first book, and liked the second one even more.<br /><br />*****<br />4.5 out of 5 stars...read this series.

030745455X|5.0|Lisabeth Salander, whom we met in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, returns to Sweden from a year of living abroad. It has been an interesting time for Lisabeth; she has matured, made some changes in her appearance, and has been working on the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, which states no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n  for any integer value of n greater than two. Salander is a very complex woman, as we discovered in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Stieg Larsson reveals more about her past in The Girl Who Played with Fire, but takes a different tact. Where Salander was central to the discovery of the evil in the previous novel, she plays a different role in this installment; she is the prime suspect in three murders. As such, she goes underground, while Mikael Blomkvist, one of the few people that believes she is innocent, races to save her and discover the real killer.<br /><br />The three people murdered in this novel are Bjurman, Salander's guardian who had brutally raped her in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Dag Svensson, a writer finishing an explosive article about the sex trade for Blomkvist's magazine, Millennium, which threatens to ruin the reputations of quite a few men, among them policemen and a judge, and Mia Johansson, Svensson's girlfriend and researcher. Svensson mentioned to Blomkvist, in their last conversation, that he had a new lead on a mysterious gangster, known as Zala, whom he wanted to track down before his article (and book) went to press.<br /><br />This book works as well as the first one. Larsson's two central characters inject themselves into the reader's mind, creating a craving that can only be slaked by reading more about them. Salander and Blomkvist are unique individuals, incredibly professional, and, even more importantly, vulnerable. Salander, while appearing irrational or violent, has a morality that is hard to ignore. Blomkvist has a personality \\"flaw\\" that causes him to methodically build his case for Salander's innocence; he wants his research to be above reproach. It's a welcome trait that sets him apart from his journalism peers. It can be infuriating to the reader, causing the pages to be turned at a rapid pace. The ending of The Girl Who Played With Fire may be gory and harrowing, but it's Salander and Blomkvist's mutual need for one another that make it transcend the horror.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained from: Book store<br />Payment: Purchasedcase for Salander's innocence; he wants his research to be above reproach.

B001C09KD0|5.0|This is an amazing and motivating account of the author's refusal to accept the status quo, but to instead make her dreams come true.  The author exudes bravery and wit and charm throughout the book.  You can't help but read it without re-evaluating your own life's dreams.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|What an interesting and chilling movie, to say the least. Once you start this movie, it'll be hard to walk away from it. With the detailed characters and lavish, albeit spooky scenery, this movie makes for a great modern-day \\"goose bump raiser\\"!
0439023483|5.0|The start of this book is alittle slow ad boring, once i got past page 20 or so I couldnt stop reading! By far the best book I've read in a long time!
B001MWBK4U|5.0|I purchased this item as a gift to a friend.  This movie is his favorite.  The fact that I found the movie at a reasonable price amused him.  Other places sold the same movie at a much higher price.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|I have two of these that I use with our Karaoke setup.  Work great and sounds great and the price is great.  We get pretty rowdy during our karaoke sessions and these haven't failed us yet.
1441412840|5.0|This is clearly the best book ever written to understand how the subconscious mind works, and how it can have a profound difference in creating a more rewarding life.  Just read and BELIEVE!!
031606792X|5.0|I am a huge Twilight Fan but also the book came in great condition.  It also came with lyrics from Blue October as well as a DVD for the Breaking Dawn Concert Series.  I have not watched it yet but I'm sure its just exceptional.
0800141601|5.0|First off, I am no fan of Richard Gere. But, all of the actors performed great. Great plot, costumes, suspense and surprises make this a great movie. Sean Connery is at his very best.
B002CIY8EM|4.0|I agree to an earlier review stating that the author leaps subject to subject.  Even annoying at times.  On upside of things i simply enjoy the ideas that he dredges up and the theories he propses.  The author makes no attempts to over embellish his theories (no more than the scholars that Preach what so many of us have taken as granted for being facts since as early as elementary school).  The Ideas are eye opening and at the very least, highly entertaining.  For I to take the time to write a review for a book i read on Amazon, I know it's worth the read.
B003VDXTWE|1.0|Since the Baroque era, the violin has been one of the most important of all Western instruments - for several reasons. The tone of the violin stands out above other instruments, making it appropriate for playing a melody line and, in the right hands, the violin is extremely agile - able to execute rapid and difficult sequences of notes. Contemporary music still embraces the violin - in sometimes new and sometimes exciting contexts - Tracy Bonham, Miri Ben Ari, Arcade Fire, Dave Matthews Band, Yellowcard...    This particular album of mostly rock tracks (or rocked-up classical compositions) with solo violin and a rock-band-augmented-backing-orchestra results in something that might be amusing as an unexpected encore at the symphony or as a novelty act in Vegas or on a television variety show. It's more gimmick than any sort of crossover genius.    I'm not knocking David Garrett's skills on the violin, but this project was poorly executed. Several of these tracks are not well suited for solo violin and those that are feel more like muzak due to heartless backing instrumentation. This is not so much the case on his earlier albums - the eponymous \\"David Garrett\\" album is a better executed set of rock/pop songs with classics mixed in to better effect.        I've listened to the entire album, not just the clips here. There was potential in spots to do something really interesting... but often I just cringed when the violin came in to awkwardly take the melody.    I'd hoped Orianthi's guitar contribution on \\"Walk This Way\\" would have been more substantial - perhaps \\"dueling strings\\"or some sort of counterpoint, echoing the groundbreaking crossover nature of the Run DMC / Aerosmith version.    A good mashup usually makes you go \\"Wow, how could A possibly go with B? That sounds crazy/awesome!\\" - In that vein, I wish \\"Vivaldi vs. Vertigo\\" had gone further contrasting the alt rock edge (U2's Vertigo) with the beautiful (Vivaldi's Winter from The 4 Seasons). I love both of theoriginals but this track was underwhelming.        I love Classical music. I love Rock music. I love solo violin. I think Nigel Kennedy's efforts in combining the three have been much more interesting, cool, and more likely to \\"get rock fans to listen to classical music\\" (Try \\"The Nigel Kennedy Experience\\" or \\"The Doors Concerto\\"). However, this time around, David Garrett's fusion of all 3 falls almost completely flat in a painful way. I can't imagine enjoying this album in a casual or critical listening context.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Mesmerizing!!!  I don' remember this book coming out in 2008.  I was on the edge of my chair most of the time.  Having been to the far east in the 80's, his vivid discription of post war USSR, 1950's was accurate and chilling.  The lie of Stalin's utopia was woven through the story, leaving you horrified.   Character development was truly wonderful.  They will stay with me a long time.  I enjoyed this book so much that I'm going to buy the hard back for loaning out.

0385532458|3.0|This is a collection of short stories.  They are not long enough to develop the plot or characters as Grisham usually does. It is worth the time to read.
B0007OCG56|4.0|I think this is a great drama! Adam Sandler does well in a serious role. The dynamics of culture and family relationships were shown very honestly - you could relate to the characters and feel the emotions the characters felt. The movie leaves you feeling sorry for Adam Sandler's character because of his wife's problems. I did feel bad for him in that he was in a difficult marriage with a difficult woman. However, while his wife had an affair - Adam Sandler also seemed to have an emotional affair. I also felt he made it pretty clear he'd be willing to go for an physical affair of his own if given the chance. So in some ways I didn't think he was the \\"bigger man\\" but this movie will really get you feeling invested in their story.
0525423842|3.0|This is an interesting book, but not up the the Grisham usual quality.  It is worth the time to read.
0439023483|5.0|I'm pretty picky about books I like. I'm an English major, so I read a lot. My favorite book is Victor Hugo's classic Les Miserables. You know what my second favorite book is? THE HUNGER GAMES! It's such a fun read. It's quick pace, the characters are fascinating, the plot is electrifying. I hear they're making a movie of it which terrifies me. I don't want anything to ruin this book!
1151097764|5.0|Read or re-read this page-turner, novel of the complex ethnic and social structure of New York City, before the Wall Street bubble, and the reader becomes enthralled with the storyline. The different worlds of this city explode - the high life of a married Wall Street bond trader and some battle-ready residents of Harlem intercept - when the Wall Street broker's expensive Mercedes, bearing his mistress, literally collides with a young, Harlem resident. Tom Wolfe is a master of delivering the inner most thought that motivate the ambitions of those who have arrived and \\"those who wish to\\" in this superb tale about New York City. THE BONFIRES OF THE VANITIES is a classic masterpiece.
0439023483|5.0|i bought this book, simply because i was told it was great. Wow! i did not expect to love it. it is truly inspiring...and seeing what goes on in this place makes me appreciate everything i have. i absolutely love this book and have read it three times in the last 6 months. you will get hooked..dont expect to be able to put it down!
B0011Z5IUK|5.0|This album turned me on to Led Zeppelin and I've never looked back. The new film \\"It Might Get Loud\\" reminded me again of what a special guitarist Jimmy Page is and it also sent me back to listening to these classic tracks. Admittedly I just bought 1 track because I already have the album. The CD looks a little scratched now but it still plays fine. Led Zeppelin endures and their music has certainly stood the test of time. Judging by other comments related to the film it seems most people still think of Led Zep as one of the greatest and deservedly so. Every track on here shimmers with blues rock power and skillful songwriting. Incredible performances from the whole band and the underrated John Paul Jones shines on the organ of Thank You, something not everyone realizes is him. My personal favorite is \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" but everything on here is fantastic. If you don't know it yet, buy this album!
0439023491|5.0|Suzanne collins has outdone herself yet again! this second book the The Hunger Games is full of excitment and adventure. i absolutely loved it..just as much as the first one. i am anxiously awaiting the third and final book!
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This film is a must see for anybody who loves guitar and especially anybody loves the music of Led Zeppelin, U2 or The White Stripes. The conversations and insights shared between the three greats is really special. It did at first seem like an unusual choice and there's obviously a lot of other guitarists to choose from who are technically stronger and play more like virtuosos but I think that's the point of the film: it's about what you do with it and music isn't about how fast or difficult it is to play, it's about whether or not it works and is original. All of these guys score highly in the originality area and all three have a huge following though arguably Jimmy Page is the big legend and the others definitely have a few \\"we're not worthy!\\" looks back and forth. The documentary footage is good and it was surprising to see where U2 started out and the actual school classroom. The age group aspect works well too. You have the old guy, the middle aged one and the younger one which illustrates the tradition of music. It's a thing that's passed on and each new generation adds to it. Good film, pass it on!
B001EN71CW|5.0|i was SO excited when i saw that this complete firefly bluray set was so inexpensive on amazon....i had to buy it. i mean, who doesnt LOVE space cowboys?! now, being a sci-fi/fantasty/gamer/geek i cant help but love this show! sure its a bit low budget and a bit campy but its also an incredibly fun ride! then you get to the end of the series and realize they canceled this fun show before they could finish the story. they did make a movie ([[ASIN:B001KOFH2G Serenity [Blu-ray]]) to wrap up some of the unanswered questions-but not all of them! haha! i guess i would call this chow a wonderful tease ;)
B003MQYR5S|3.0|The story in this DVD is not as interesting as the true life story of how this was  Ledger's last movie and how his death affect his castmates.

B000PDYVVG|4.0|My Kindle was stolen a couple weeks ago, so I purchased this book in paperback new for $8.99.  I received my new kindle today and was dissapointed to see that the Kindle price was higher than the book price.  Guess I'll finish reading it in the paperback format.

0385523386|4.0|Piper Kerman provides us with a warts and all, but not \\"Chained Heat,\\" version of life in a woman's prison.  Here intent here is not to focus on how she was wrongfully convicted, thankfully she doesn't waste our time doing that, but rather on the every day life of a person serving time in prison.  She writes with eloquence about what she went through and the simple joys and mindless hassles that someone goes through in jail.     While I liked this book, I would have liked to see Kerman give more detail on her own involvement with the ring.  She does skimp on what she knew and when she knew it.  To her it was this big adventure and I sense there is a part of her that still sees it like that.  She also makes a rudimentary mention of how her actions hurt others but really does not atone for them.  Here remorse seems superficial and not at all genuine.     This is an interesting book and I recommend it to anyone who would be interested in penology. But I would like to see Kerman speak about how foolish she was and maybe share some of her drug money windfall, which is coming through this book, with those less fortunate than her.
B002PNAY9C|5.0|An amazing book. One of the best books I've ever read. It is so discriptive thet it makes you feel like your realy there.
0307346617|4.0|This is one of those times when I really wish there was three and a half stars. I'm half-way between liking it and really liking this book.<br /><br />First off, it's not a comedy. His previous zombie effort was written in a tongue-in-cheek tone, and sometimes even funny, but this is a work of serious fiction. (I mean, as serious as any book with zombies in the title can be.)<br /><br />Instead of telling the story with a standard narrative, Brooks goes for an \\"oral history\\" -- not even short stories in some cases, but interviews with the historian compiling the oral history. Overall, I'd say the storytelling works fairly well, but there are times when I really wanted more from a particular character. And sometimes a lot less. And in the end, I found the story quite unsatisfying. I felt like I got just a glimpse into the overall possibilities.<br /><br />That said, the writing is good, and I love the way he's merged international relations, and multiple non-English speaking voices into the mix of stories. Worth a read!
B00288KNJU|5.0|My kids absolutely love this movie! They are boys 14 and 6. The Coraline (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy w/ 3D) was a great value. I added the movie to my son's IPOD, so he can watch it anytime.
0393061310|5.0|This book affected the way that I looked at the world, from a historical perspective, and in every world-building exercise I've ever undertaken for a novel or short story.<br /><br />It literally change my perspective.<br /><br />A must read for anyone who wants to write speculative fiction or understand why it is that some groups of people, i.e., the West, has so much, and some other groups, i.e., the developing world, has so little. I really wish I'd read this before I wrote The Amadeus Net. Not that I feel like I got the relationships wrong, but because I may have been a little too hard on both parties.
B00005O3VD|5.0|My dvd came within the time frame indicated, brand new in the package, and is in perfect condition.
0143036556|4.0|This isn't quite as engrossing as guns, germs, and steel is, despite the fact that it's about the apocalypse of many a historical society. (Easter Island, the Vikings in Greenland.)<br /><br />I'd skip past the initial chapter about the mining industry in Montana, so you can get into the book, but make sure you come back to it, as it's important to the overall thesis.<br /><br />Should be required reading for everyone on the planet -- at least, anyone making decisions about how we're using our resources.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Product came quickly and in the exact condition they specified. would defiantly do business with them again.
0307592839|5.0|Disclaimer: I am reviewing an advance copy I received for free through the Vine program. But I swear, I'm not a Parrot (INAP)!<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical, from all the praise for this book in other reviews, before reading it myself. But they're absolutely right, it is wonderful!<br /><br />I don't want to spoil it for you any more than other reviews have already spoiled it, so I'll avoid any specific plot details ..... but I enjoyed every page of this book, it made me think, it made me wonder, it made me remember things from my own life, it made me laugh, it made me cringe sometimes, it shocked and surprised me sometimes, it re-affirmed my intuitions and expectations at other times, ...<br /><br />If you've ever been at all into live music, New York City, San Francisco, young punks, old farts, old farts who were young punks, weird people, sex and drugs and anarchy and music, the music business, introspection and watching people (including yourself) change and grow over time, ...... I promise you, you will love this book!<br /><br />The characters are vibrant and come alive. I'd be interested in reading other stories about them. The story itself is interesting, apart from how it is presented. I'd be interested in reading more aspects of it.<br /><br />The writing style is effective, also fresh and interesting, and varies a lot, and there are some experiments in the writing, which work well (yes there are some passages/chapters/stories written in first person perspective e.g. the protagonist is \\"I\\", others in third person e.g. \\"he/she\\", also one surprisingly powerful and moving one in second person e.g. \\"you\\", and even one in the form of a Powerpoint presentation, that works amazingly well).
B001BPJJ1E|1.0|They need to do a better transfer of this movie.  This version is VHS quality and in full screen (not wide screen).
B0036EH3XE|5.0|It ended a bit sadder than I thought it might have ended, but I still feel it was a great ending to a truly fascinating story.
1401922732|5.0|I have several of Doreen Virtue's decks and I LOVE this one!!!  A very powerful deck!
0393078299|5.0|A lot has been written about the Bohr-Einstein debate so when I first saw this book I did not buy it because I was skeptical about what more could be said.  On reading other reviews I decided it might be worthwhile.    Many scientists I've met are still passionate about the implications of quantum mechanics, Einstein's criticisms of the theory and Bohr's responses to those criticisms.  Many scientists who are not outwardly enthusiastic about the debate and history seem to have approaches toward science that are influenced by it. (just my opinion).  In any case, the subject of this book is fascinating.    Of the books I have read about this topic this one may be the best read.
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown's latest is an easy read (perfect for summer reading) and has just the right blend of suspense, historical mystery/speculation, and fascinating historical background. I came away with a better understanding of the background of our Nation's Capital (where the action takes place.) I loved the fast paced action and the intriguing cryptic mysteries to be solved along the way. The reading also leaves you with a good feeling and scene of wonder for things we might just take for granted. Well done!
B0024RIMBG|5.0|This was a wonderful musical journey at Slane Castle in Ireland.  The song selections were awesome and heart warming.  There was an energy in the air that touched our emotions.  Even though it was on DVD, it was as if you were there in person.  It was a wonderful performance.  One of the best we've seen coming from Ireland.
030726999X|3.0|This coda to the \\"Millenium Trilogy\\" as it is being referenced these days, is well worth reading, but I have not given it 5 stars simply because I felt it was a bit too long and could have used some editing. Had the author not passed away shortly after handing in all three manuscripts at once, I am sure some editing would have been done. This last novel wholly centers around the main character, Lisbeth Salander and while that may be appropriate, her character didn't seem to develop any further than it had since the first novel.  The plot, while interesting, needed a tighter thread with less players and more action. I could have easily skimmed a hundred pages or more of dialogue between the police and Kalle or the ever present coffee talk and gotten straight to the action without missing anything essential. Does this novel end well, yes. But, the climax and denouement sort of left me feeling a tad deflated and not really wanting more as the first and second novels did. Overall, it was a decent read and worth the time. Again, it's too bad the author is not around to write more social commentary/mystery thrillers.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I saw the Opera and then I went on line and got the movie. Both are worth seeing.
1416905014|5.0|My daughter got this for Christmas and adores it.  She loves it so much, she snuck it in to school to show her friends.  It is not a good book for small children to play independently with, it is very detailed and elaborate.  It is by far the most elaborate pop up book I have ever seen.  Truly beautiful.  I am not a fan of the whole princess thing, but my daughter is.  This book is the princess bomb if your 3-4 years old.
B000I5XDXS|5.0|GREAT PICTURE AND SOUND ON BLU-RAY. TOTO IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS. YOU WILL ENJOY THIS CONCERT ALOT!
B000W4D94I|5.0|I love this movie and watch it every spring.     Our favorite line, \\"We've got cows\\".
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Highly recommended! You will fall in love with Enzo, the canine narrator, as he plans his future and goes through liife with his people family. You will laugh, probably cry, and definitely rejoice at the ending of the story. Garth Stein is a genius when it comes to putting himself into a canine mindset. I have recommended this book to everyone I know, pet lovers and others alike.
0312370849|5.0|This book is a must read.      I purchased it in French when I was on vacation in France in April, loved it, then ordered it in English through Amazon so that my family and friends could read it.    Everyone loved it.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Even though I had previously read the book, this movie was well worth the watch.  They did a great job following the book, with the special effects supporting the imagery created by the story line.  I highly recommend this movie.
0307476154|5.0|In The Girl Who Played with Fire, Stieg Larsson's sequel to the [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]] and the second book in his Millenium Trilogy, Lisbeth Salander is the focus of a manhunt following the murders of her guardian, Nils Bjurman and a pair of writers who are about to publish two exposes of sex traffickers in Sweden. The physical evidence left at the scenes of the crimes point to Salander as the main suspect and while a team of police detectives investigates the crimes, two parallel investigations are launched by Salander's old boss at Milton Security, Dragan Armansky, and Mikael Blomkvist, her friend from the first book and the publisher of the expose.<br /><br />The book delves into Salander's past through the murder investigations, making connections between sex traffickers, corrupt Swedish government officials, cold war spies and defectors, Soviet military programs and motorcycle gangs. Salander's place in all this and how it relates to her family helps to explain her unique personality.<br /><br />Larsson really has a deft command of all the thriller elements. As the investigation proceeds in a mesmerizing fashion, he doles out the twists and turns, the revelations, the colorful minor and interesting major characters. Salander in particular becomes quite a compelling character in this book, compared to the first one where she was more peripheral, as her background is revealed even as she hides from the authorities. The Girl Who Played with Fire is an exciting, action packed thriller that won't disappoint fans of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I look forward to reading the [[ASIN:030726999X The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]].
B003INBOEM|5.0|I rented at redbox, never heard of it before, and shortly after watching I ordered on Blu Ray.   The movie was incredible.  It is not just for Martial Arts fans either, it is very well made and will be enjoyed by all movie watching types.  This movie more than earns its 5 stars.
0316069906|4.0|This book helped lure my teenaged son away from meat and fowl. At his school, he and his brother heard Foer speak at his school after last Thanksgiving, during his book tour. While my older son reverted to meat soon after, my wife and I have stuck with my younger son. We finally gave up chicken and turkey as we had gradually beef and pork.<br /><br />I mention this as testament not to the message Foer promotes, for that's familiar. But he convinced my family of his thesis: \\"We need a better way to talk about animals.\\" Like billions of consumers in cities, we ignore factory farms as \\"animal agriculture.\\" This system comprises 99% of all meat which we buy as \\"processed.\\" I use Foer's euphemism for the slaughtering and butchering methods that he, in a clandestine night visit to an enormous turkey \\"farm,\\" compels us to witness. He relates what \\"rescue\\" means for one small bird, unforgettably.<br /><br />That is, he does not sentimentalize, preach, or pander. He stays calm. \\"Just as nothing we do has the direct potential to cause nearly as much animal suffering as eating meat, no daily choice that we make has a greater impact on the environment.\\" He integrates facts accessibly; the graphic presentation familiar from his novels here increases his data's power. 40% more of an impact on global warming than all of transport combined is due to animal agriculture. A KFC chicken (a drugged football with feet) lives 39 days and an \\"organic\\" one but 42. For all the fish discarded when serving a helping of sushi, the true haul of that catch would fill a plate five feet in diameter. Cattle now live only 12-15 months. On the slaughter line, cows may survive for seven minutes after they're supposedly stunned and bled.<br /><br />He confronts how we get what's on our plates. He challenges us to engage in dialogue with our neighbors, and with our families. He visits the touted \\"natural\\" alternative of Niman Ranch; he learns that this once-idealistic business has just been sold to a factory farm. His interspersed accounts from a PETA activist, a family-based turkey rancher, and workers involved in the raising, care, and killing of animals enrich this narrative's depth.<br /><br />Foer's grandmother during the Holocaust literally risked death rather than eating pork: such an example burrows deep into ancestral contentions where food and survival contend with conscience and commitment. His Judaism and its kosher tradition also deepen this tension. He faces disengaging from thousands of years of lamb-shanked Seders, and childhood Thanksgivings and barbecues. He examines how our \\"table fellowship\\" tests the bonds of family and friendship vs. those of individual ethics and global betterment.<br /><br />At times, as with his musings on Judaism and his family, its organization jumps about, as his novels do. It can be diffused or contemplative. It also stays hard-hitting and open-minded. It's challenging now and then to figure out its direction. So, this narrative may confound those wanting a more disinterested arrangement of anecdotes, factoids, reporting, and reflection. But I was surprised how fast the pages flew, despite or because of its idiosyncratic pace and unflinching attention to quirky or grisly detail.<br /><br />Foer spent three years researching this book. He wrote it to explain to his newborn son why his father chose not to eat any more animals. \\"Will he be among the first of a generation that doesn't crave meat because he never tasted it? Or will he crave it even more?\\"<br /><br />As with my older son--who has chosen to not eat meat when at home--my family along with many readers may agree with Foer's pronouncement: \\"The justifications for eating animals and for not eating them are often identical: we are not them.\\" Yet, we can not claim ignorance any longer. For, reading this, and honestly articulating the unease about our fried chicken, cheap burgers, and greasy drumsticks--and the fish that I admit I still eat, more guiltily than before--you will close this book more conscious, more humanly aware, of the choices we all make three times every day.<br /><br />This is why, even as Foer remains a nuanced proponent of vegetarianism, he finds that compromise with organic this or free-range that sells short our potential to solve the dilemmas that factory farming presents as Third World demand increases the bargain-priced flesh.

Your explanation of personal responsibility allowed me to further my understanding and deepen my appreciation of \\"Owning 100%.\\" I believe The Compound Effect is a classic and a must read. Thank you for sharing it with me.     Leave nothing to chance!     Barry
030745455X|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel, as well as the next two novels in the series.  The story started out slow because the character development is very good, and the back story is intricate.  It is worth getting through the first, slow-paced 50 pages, if you are looking for a suspenseful thriller with richly written, creative and sometimes surprisingly likable heroes.  Also, it is refreshing to read a novel that conveys the European open-mindedness and truthful, if not painful, acceptance of human differences and individuality in it's main characters.  Stieg Larsson was a talent.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|I got introduced to reading about this character back in the late 1980's.  It may not be going too far to say Richard Feynman is an American hero.  Read about him and then you decide.    Eccentric, brilliant, helped make history in several ways.  As a side job single handedly discovered the cause of one of the world's worst air accidents when the comity charged with that responsibility was at a loss for a solution.  His students loved him; they wrote these books about him.    There is even a classroom educational tool called a Feynman diagram.  Besides all that the stories are interesting and humorous.  Anything but a dry biography.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|While being very different, it proves there are 'uniquely' BEAUTIFUL people! It tells so many stories - it IS a love story, it is about rehabilitation, and it is poignant. Maggie Gyllenhall is a FINE actress and I can think of few who could have done it so well. James Spader is also remarkable.     I bought this movie as I need to view it about every 3 months as a gentle reminder that it takes all kinds to make the world go around.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I will not compare this with the others. Let's just say it takes me to that special place where good music always can. I've been a fan of his from \\"Room for Squares\\" and his talent is evident in this project as well. I recommend this for all the John Mayer fans.
B00006RAKP|5.0|If you're younger and weren't around during Elton John's   emergence and peak creative streak in the 70's and are   just discovering the brilliance of the work that he and   Bernie Taupin (and his amazing band) brought to life,   then this is a good starting point for you.   If you are longtime fan who just wants a collection of most   of his career-spanning hits and don't always have the time   to go through every album, then this is also a great   collection to have.  The remastering sounds great and   most of the hits are on here with the exception of fan   faves like \\"Skyline Pigeon\\", \\"Harmony\\" and other stellar   album tracks which may not have been released as singles,   but were definitely loved in their time and beyond!  But as is the case with all great artists' whose careers   span decades and who've enjoyed such a high level of   artistic creative achievement for so long, it seems almost   impossible to create an all-encompassing compilation which   will satisfy every fans taste!  However, this one is very pleasing with the   exceptions of the ones I mentioned above and   maybe a few more! Still worth buying. (-:  I also like that they put a few of the songs from   Elton's \\"iffy\\" early 80's period when his music had   kind of fell from grace and he was himself swirling  in the storms of addiction and indentity issues.   Then, in the mid 80's he enjoyed a return to form,   the top of the charts, and began to conquer his demons head on!  By the early 90's, he and Bernie Taupin had separated   for awhile, then gotten back together to write sporadically,   but Elton was expanding his collaborations into broadway   and film scoring, working with the likes of   Andrew Lloyd Webber and others, coming into another   fertile period creatively that has sustained  his legend into the 21st Century!  If you're not familiar with the 70's albums,   perhaps this compilation will inspire you to go   back and discover what made Elton John one of   modern music's immortals!

0307474712|3.0|One Day starts with a bang. Dexter and Emma casually hook-up on the eve of their graduation from university.  Witty banter ensues and as we skip over the years (we get snapshots of July 15 every year), there are lots of funny vignettes of cruddy jobs, secret yearnings, missed opportunities, bad relationships gone awry, and all the fun stuff that comes with being 25-40.  Emma is a worthy heroine - smart, self-deprecating, with great insight into her life even if she can't help everything that happens to her.  Dex is the weaker character - self-centered and completely uninterested in being self-introspective.  Their relationship is actually a dynamic that plays true to real life. Unfortunately, as in real life, Dex is pretty horrible most of the time.  (And in real life, you just want to slap any woman who would put with it all.)  Nicholls at least understands that and makes Dex's life pretty laughable for most of the book.  The last third of the book becomes extremely earnest with the usual bittersweet ending that, while contrived, still packs a nice punch.  This wasn't anywhere near the best book I've read about relationships (comparing it to The Time Traveller's Wife is a farce! That book was something completely different.)  However it was a fun read and went down easily.
0446563048|5.0|I read this book while on a 4 week holiday in Europe this summer with my family. Couldn't put it down. Frankly, it's GOLD.

B000SGGUWS|5.0|Ok so book 1 was on sale and figured I would read it before the TV show came out so I could get a better feel for the characters. Yeah so now I have the show recorded on my DVR but I refuse to watch it till I'm done with the whole series which will probably be soon. I read books 1-3 in a week and working on book 4.  I am totally addicted and I haven't even set foot on my HS campus in lets say over 10 years. Defiantly not just a young adult novel.  Do plan on buying the whole series though cause you just can't stop till you know who A is and why he/she is meddling in all their lives.  I do have to admit I want to slap pretty much all of the adults in these books for treating their children like they do.  The parents are more immature then the kids.
0545123275|4.0|I loved the idea; which is why I read the book to begin with. But it was a lot of telling the story, not much showing and I think some history would have been nice. More on the wolf ways and how they came to be would have been great.     It was entertaining, but easy to put down, except for the very beginning and the very end which were awesome.
0307266303|4.0|At last, a brutally honest and unapologetic book about endurance running. Born to Run breaks tradition with other running books on the market which spend more time regurgitating fundamental technicalities and adulating the running elite than telling it like it is. Christopher McDougall goes beyond conventional running wisdom to unearth the \\"it\\" that makes a unique bread of athletes who subject themselves to inhumane conditions, then come back for more. Rather than harping about VO2 Max and periodized-training tables he joins pioneering lifetime coach and expert Dr. Joe Vigil who concludes that he was learning \\"more and more about less and less\\" before finding the \\"it\\" at a 100 mile trail run in Leadville, CO. Dr. Vigil traveled to Leadville to witness members of the obscure Mexican Tarahumara tribe, the \\"Running Man\\", running barefoot with a smile on their faces. He learned from these natural athletes that running wasn't all about winning, but rather how to live.<br />The grit and tenacity required for endurance running attracts a unique brand of athlete who are the antithesis of the running fraternity and the author does a splendid job describing their idiosyncrasies, neurosis and fervor in a way that endears them to the reader. McDougall pulls no punches taking shots at running gurus including Phil Knight, founder of Nike, and Bill Bowerman, legendary University of Oregon coach, claiming that the one could sell anything and the other thought he knew everything. He makes a case that the evolution of the running shoe was the impetus for the proliferation of running injuries.<br />In the final episode McDougall befriends a transplanted eccentric accepted by the Tarahumara who coordinates what he refers to as The Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen. The field includes long-time trail running champion Scott Jurek and a host of other acclaimed trail running eccentrics who travel to Copper Canyons in the remote state of Chihuahua, Mexico to challenge the Tarahumara on their home turf. While a Tarahumara runner crosses the finish line before Jurek to win the 50-mile race, the lesson is that the joy or running and camaraderie trump awards.<br />Born to Run is look into a largely counterculture sport and a unique body of research supporting unconventional conclusions. The book is a good read for endurance athletes who love the sport and want to explore new horizons as well as anyone who is curious about the type of athlete who would risk life and limb to compete in a 150-mile race through Death Valley.r home turf.

B002ZG980U|5.0|Christopher Nolan's follow-up to 2008's megahit The Dark Knight was rumored as many different films that had been seen by no one. \\"This film is revolutionary!\\" \\"It sucks!\\" \\"It's dumb and pointless!\\" \\"It's amazing!\\"  And having finally seen Inception, without many expectations, I can tell you that if you were to see one film, for the remainder of the summer, you should make it Inception.    Inception has alot going for it. Its cast works wonders, because every actor brings something fresh and new to the table. It never feels outdated, or irrelevant. It's original without being idiotic. It's intelligent without being implausible. It doesn't take its extremely layered plot too seriously, and there's one thing that really separates it from any other summer action flick: It requires a great deal of thought. You don't know where it's going next. Once it pulls you into its clutches, it takes you on a ride that is unlike anything you've seen onscreen in years. Its ending will be debated, analyzed and picked apart by many film snobs across the world, and it's a film that doesn't just deserve, but requires multiple viewings. It's a hell of alot to take in at once.    Now, in any film review, a reader would like to know what the piece is about. This one's plot is better left unsaid, because the first viewing is enough to leave the audience in utter awe. However, I'll do my best to at least give you an idea.    Leonardo DiCaprio outshines any of his previous works, playing Dom Cobb, a thief who is proficient in extraction (going into a subject's mind, during dreams, and stealing their ideas, and using them against them), who is embarking on one final job before he can retire, and go home for good. Instead of stealing a subjects dream, he and his team decide to do the opposite. Not to steal a dream, but to go into a person's subconscious and plant an idea.     Joseph Gordon-Levitt, of (500) Days Of Summer fame, and Ellen Page, of Juno fame, Marion Cotillard, of Nine and La Vie En Rose greatness, Ken Watanabe, of The Last Samurai, Cillian Murphy, of indie film fame, and a few legends (Michael Caine and Tom Berenger) are the heart of this film. There is truly great acting all around. Everybody brings something new to the table. Each character is richly detailed, and multi-layered. Nobody is really who they say they are. Gordon-Levitt, Page and Cotillard are a few of my favorite actors of the current generation, who haven't had their \\"big breaks\\" quite yet. They've had a few parts that they're semi-well known for, and this film is a fabulous transition into mainstream cinema. That's because this is an art-house film that is financed by a major studio. That's the beauty of it. Insight, intelligence and uncanny originality are things you don't see in movies anymore. It's a breath of fresh air to see something as unique and interesting as this.    But, at the end of the day, it's Christopher Nolan's genius ideas, smart script, elegant direction, and masterful artistry that make this picture what it is. This is a film that I could picture the writer-director losing his mind over. It's his story, it's his game. He invents a world that you've never seen in any type of film before. It's reminiscent of The Matrix, and the early James Bond pictures. It creates its own metropolis, and its own rules. It breaks the rules of conventional American cinema. And thank god for that. Inception is one of the best films so far in 2010.
0307473473|2.0|Parts of this book were very compelling. Unfortunately, a lot of it was extremely slow & boring. Too much background on minor characters, on financial and political matters. Long discussions about the future of a magazine - who cares? The solution to the mystery, as well as other parts of the book, turned out to be totally repulsive, sexual violence kind of stuff. I didn't like either of the main characters. I found Lisbeth to be off-putting and cold and Blomkvist to be boring.
B0006L0LOS|2.0|\\"Catwoman\\" is so repulsive, it made anime catgirls who watched it hack up feces and throw the content at a hero's face, and then have him scratched into pieces.  It's a amalgamation of Warner Bros' heinously-produced superhero movies of the past, thinly-disguised as an empowering chick flick.  Not to mention the public attention of having one of the worst superhero costumes ever, but to be fair, despite looking like a dominatrix mouse with clothes taken from a thrift store, [[ASIN:1563899086 at least she didn't wear those ugly goggles]].  It's kind sad that such attention goes for such a wear, because she actually work a decent 'prototype' costume before her official wardrobe disaster: it was a tight leather pants (unshredded) and a long-sleeve jacket followed by black mask; she looked presentable, and she didn't seem less agile wearing more clothes than she does wearing less.  If she just cover her head with a bandana (and wearing cat ears), that would've been the right costume for her, but no, she wanted to look like a laughingstock to even perverts.<br /><br />It's about a not-Selena Kyle named Patience (Berry), a weedy design for ads in a big make-up business owned by a rich jerk and her wife, the latter played by a not-looking-good-in-her-older-years Sharon Stone.  When Patience was about to fall from her apartment after saving a mysterious cat, she was rescued by detective named Rico Suave---that's not his actual name, but Benjamin Bratt played a character who did nothing but coming on to the lead actress, so that name is appropriate.  Later, Patience went into a make-up facility when she overheard that her company's new product is tainted and dangerous for anyone who tried it; she was killed as a result.  And then came the stupidest plot-device happened: the same mysterious cat walk on her corpse, YAWNED AT HER FACE, and not only did it revived her, it gave her acute senses and extreme agility.  But such dexterity comes as a price when she has to carry all of the quirks of a cat; walking on thin ledges on her own two feet, having an obsessive craving for fish, having dogs bark at her, and having a fear of rain.  Oh, and she can teleport from one place to another, though that sounds more like a magician that a cat's ability.<br /><br />I wish I didn't make this sound stupid, but it really is.  What's next, does she bath herself with her tongue and does she breed 3 litters after 3 months?  Not even a few comics I read and some cartoons I've seen painted \\"Catwoman\\" in such a literal manner.  The stupidity didn't help but how warped the film is directed.  It seems like Pitof, the film's director, has see the first \\"Spider-Man\\" and wanted to imitate its free-flowing camera angles.  Except he wanted to use more of that style, whether it be backgrounds shots, interiors, character POVs, third-person perspective, wherever it can move around. This approach to filming is so tacky and distracting, it actually makes the film look fake (especially during Catwoman jumping across buildings); half the time I thought I was watching a 3D-animated movie, except this is live-action.  Editing is another seque to nitpick.  Some of the scene edits are weird, like that one scene where the guy was taking, and the scene keeps cutting to the same character in the same position (i.e. opening scene for [[ASIN:6302261589 \\"Cool As Ice\\"]]).  Sometimes, the film even has a few goofs, like when a burglar tried to break a glass class with his gun, but the glass case was smashed before his gun even made impact; it's a notable goof, and it's been done twice!<br /><br />Halle Berry tried to do something with her character, but she was totally boned.  She made horrible puns, her assertive attitude is laughable, and she did nothing to make Catwoman act sexual as well as appear sexual; she can be even too enamored with herself, like when her superego is dancing around on the center of a club stage and is lashing her whip around.  The story was stupid, the acting was weak, and fights are meandering.  \\"Catwoman\\" failed to be a provocative movie as well as being popcorn entertainment.are meandering.  \\"Catwoman\\" failed to be a provocative movie as well as being popcorn entertainment.

158049577X|3.0|We purchased this book for a school summer reading assignment. It did not meet our expectations as the pages are so thin, they could not be highlighted as required by the teacher. The color ran through to the next page making it impossible to read or highlight that page... We were hoping for more substantial paper throughout the book. If you don't care about the thinness of the paper, then this book will easily meet your needs.

0805087184|5.0|I started collecting children's books long before my daughter was born, but I never bought this one.  Every time I would read it in a bookstore, I couldn't figure out what all they hype was about.  It's kind of weird:  Why is the horse blue?  (\\"Blue horse, blue horse, what do you see?\\")  And why is the cat purple?  All of the other animals are the correct colors.  The words seemeded, at the time, repetitive and boring.  And I thought it was odd that there was a teacher at the end.  It seemed like this book belonged in a classroom rather than at home.<br /><br />Fast forward to a few months ago, when my daughter, at the time 11 months old, went to a little baby-and-mommy enrichment class that I take her to.  The teacher read this book, and my daughter was enthralled.  She stared and stared, and she kept scooching up closer to the teacher for a better view.  And the teacher's delivery-- filled with enthusiasm about what was on the next page, and with the ANIMAL SOUNDS that each animal makes-- kept every child in the class completely captivated.  I still don't understand the animal colors, but I've changed my mind about this book.  I have come to believe that taste in books is something one is born with, and everyone is different.  While I would never have picked this book out for my daughter, she clearly loves it, and for that reason, I now love it, too.  I can't believe how much she took to it, but I bought the book today, and am excited to read it to her tonight.<br /><br />For those whose children find this book boring, I can think of two possibilities:  (a)  they just have different taste than the kids who do, or (b) your delivery could be better.  Try reading it with excitement about what could POSSIBLY be on the next page, and doing the corresponding animal sounds as you turn to each animal.  It might help breathe some new life into the book for your child.<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear the book was changed from its original version.  That's really a shame.  I still gave it 5 stars, because of my daughter's reaction to it, but I agree that the format should NEVER have been changed for classic like this book.because of my daughter's reaction to it, but I agree that the format should NEVER have been changed for classic like this book.
B0036EBARO|5.0|Goldfrapp fans are a weird bunch. Will Gregory and Alison Goldfrapp have experimented so wildly with each album since their first in 2000, that we come from a variety of musical tastes and preferences. Those of us who were lured in by a single off of Black Cherry and loved Supernature's hard-edged electro sound have very different expectations from the people whose first experience was the haunting and epic Felt Mountain and still believe it's their best work.    I'm one of the latter, and while Head First is nothing at all like Felt Mountain, that strange Goldfrapp approach to songcraft that got me in the first place is alive and well here--quite possibly the most since Felt Mountain.     To say Head First is dripping with 80s pop is like saying Felt Mountain has lots of strings. Yup, it does. But there's *so* much more going on here than that superficial observation. If Head First were just a collection of reworkings of Abba songs, it would fall flat, just like Felt Mountain would have fallen flat if it were a straightforward riff on some Howard Shore soundtracks. But these are amazingly crafted songs, catchy, complex, strange, beautifully orchestrated, that reward each new listen with a little more detail revealed.     People who complain that Goldfrapp has yet to settle on a \\"signature sound\\" are missing the point. That's just not what Will and Alison do. They're like one of my other favorite (and much more indie) bands, Midlake: They were born to explore, and they'll have found new territory with each album.     One postscript: The beautifully bizarre \\"Voicething\\" is an oddity even on this album. It doesn't quite fit with the other tracks, and almost seems to hint at the next album just like \\"Utopia\\" on Felt Mountain hinted at Black Cherry... If that's where Goldfrapp is headed next, count me in.

B0002JP4L4|5.0|Forget the 2011 Footloose reboot, this 1983 original is the only choice for me. Kevin Bacon delivers one of his finest performance as Ren McCormick- the teenage rebel with a cause who is transplanted in a small town, who's repressive somewhat tyrannical Rev. Shaw Moore (John Lithgow) has convinced everyone in town to discard and destroy books, movies, and dancing because they are all a sign of immoral behavior.  McCormick runs afoul of the older more conservative generation who believe much like the reverend that certain books and movies confuse the soul and lead to immoral behavior. Going stir crazy in such a small town were he's labeled as a dangerous outsider, Ren decides to fight against the conservative order to get a Senior Prom for the students of Beaumont High School. He finds an unlikely collection of allies including Ariel (Lori Singer), the reverends rebellious and free minded daughter and Willard (Chris Penn), a tough guy prone to getting into fights who really can't dance at all. The cast is topped off by a wonderful, if understated performance by Diane Wiest as Rev. Moore's wife Vie.     Footloose has always stood out for me because it had the depth that most movies geared towards teenagers today don't have. In Ren McCormick, there's a youthful adolescent still smarting over the perceived abandonment by his father, which causes him to be troublemaker to the small town residents of Beaumont, leading him to become this unlikely rebel with a cause character. Ariel Moore acts out because ever since her older brother died in a car crash while playing highway tag, she has been acting out trying to forget her brother on one level, while seeking to connect with her father who became more conservative after his son died. The greatest plot-line is Lithgow as Shaw Moore, who on one hand has appointed himself the spiritual light of the community, but delivers a sympathetic portrayal on the grounds that he was doing much of this because he was aroused by the tragicdeath of his son. Footloose speaks on issues of censorship, coming of age, and toleration.    The extras here are interesting: You can watch the movie with commentary from Kevin Bacon or Producer/Writer Craig Zaden. There's also a series of short features that discuss the making of Footloose and the process of crafting the soundtrack that's on equal footing with the movie in my eyes. However, I noticed that much of the DVD content was aired as part of AMC's DVD on TV version of the movie in 2005 or 06. But since I'm probably one of the few people who have a tape of the AMC airing, true fans of Footloose will not notice anything.
B003M6DJF2|3.0|Glee is a great show and this episode sets the tone for the series.    But I don't think this is the same editing as the \\"director's cut\\" I saw on DVD a couple of months back.    It seems like the editing, especially early in this episode, is very choppy and condensed.  And there is one specific thing I remember from the DVD that is not in this.  When Shue goes to the football team and is addressing them,  most of his talk is deleted.  I remember Puck telling Shue that he could sing, offers to show him, and then flatulates.  This is not in this version.  It seems to me a lot of stuff was deleted, especially in the early part of the episode.    Caveat Emptor - or buy the DVD version.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|Gotta love kylie for giving us super pop music that we can dance to! The songs sound straight from the 80's but modern at the same time!     Aphrodite is the best dance track. It could be one of her all time best dance tracks alongside can't get you outta my head! It's more R&B though, but definitely Pop.  Cupid Boy is the best sexy dance track. Very different sounding. Midtempo but get's very heavy at certain points, to great effect. It's also danceable, but more of a striptease number.   Get outta my way is the best party song. Again, it's pure pop. If this doesn't make you dance or at least cheer you up, then you're inhuman.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Read these stories aloud as we traveled in the auto. Good story content, well described--without being to wordy, felt as though we were there with the character/s. My only thought is that the Kindle doesn't convert money amounts so we had to just makeup our own figures. Didn't really change the story line any. Enjoyable book to real aloud, even motivated a magazine only reading adult to pick up a book and read alone. :)
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Great videography. David Attenborough is far better than Oprah. Do not get the Oprah version.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Although this series started before I was born, I recently became obsessed with it and it is now among my favorite movie series of all time.  Definitely in the top 5 anyway.  I found this set when searching for a box set of all the movies and being a movie buff I was excited to see all the extras included in the Quadrilogy box set.  Although a few of the special effects are dated, cheesy or downright bad, these are still some GREAT movies when you're in the mood for suspense/action/horror.  Would definitely recommend this set for anyone who not only loves sci-fi and horror movies, but also for someone who really needs in-depth coverage on the making of the films and behind the scenes information and interviews.

B002ZG97RE|5.0|The movie tells the truth!! The truth seems to bother the right wing-nuts. Why do you all have to be marching in lockstep with the lies and propaganda that the Cheney/Bush administration fed you? Are you that naive or are you just that ignorant of the facts.
B002WTC93S|3.0|I share many of the enthusiastic reactions of other reviewers of this novel. As a writer and storyteller, Nesbo is way in front of the recent Scandinavian masters of the genre who have, in my view, produced the best police procedurals in the last generation, though I find Henning Mankell (Kurt Wallender procedurals), the reigning champion of the genre, tedious. But Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall, of some decades ago, still reign supreme.<br /><br />Nesbo has some first-order talents: his characters are leanly drawn, yet complex; his story telling skills are masterful: the scenes of violence, for instance, are unexpected and devastating -to the reader as well as to the victims, and sometimes to the perpetrator. (Nesbo seems is more comfortable with violence than with tenderness, but maybe that's a weakness of the genre--and of his hero, Henry Hole.<br /><br />In the end, unfortunately, the very richness and complexity of the plot paralyze the story. The denouement seemed contrived and self-conscious. The plot device used to convince the reader that the villain of the piece could be one and the same with one of its most noble characters was fatally unconvincing. The extensive `confession' of the culprit had a flatness that seemed entirely unsuited to the character and somehow vulgarized the entire experience. Part of the problem, I think, was that Nesbo had too much complexity to unravel at the end. There were too many important characters, all with much the same experiences, and with some pretending to be someone else, reducing the huge machine of a plot to a crawl for the final 50 pages<br /><br />Moreover, some of the twists and turns seemed superfluous and distracted from the central story's momentum. Why for example did he need to introduce Sofia at all? Why the largely extraneous side story involving Inspector Waaler, which, astonishingly, was never resolved. Did Nesbo himself get so confused, he forgot to settle with this character?<br /><br />So I was in the end hugely disappointed at this bravura undertaking-- because it came so close to being so good.<br /><br />But I'll give Nesbo another chance; a thinner and more disciplined book could take him over the Sjowall/Wahloo bar.ura undertaking-- because it came so close to being so good.     But I'll give Nesbo another chance; a thinner and more disciplined book could take him over the Sjowall/Wahloo bar.
B001DDBCV4|4.0|Love the movie, but since I got the movie so late, I wasn't qualified to get the digital copy of it since it expired last year.

B003A060K6|4.0|I admit to being a fan of Caribou, so I was prepared to like this cd;  I was not disappointed in the least.  Caribou is right on near perfect on his latest disc.  This is ear candy in the best sense of the phrase.   Mellow , trippy, psychedelic, fanciful, freespirited, creative and alive with melodies and riffs galore!  A real fun album to uplift your moods.  It's been in my cd player a lot this past month.  Very satisfying as an overall piece of work that ranks high on the scale of pop deliciousness that makes it all worthwhile....enjoy and often.......
B002ZG9846|1.0|And NO Im not a super postive person who thinks somethings wrong with people for liking this movie because all of the violence and swearing. This movie started out pretty good & felt like the 1st Spider-Man movie but in reverse. It felt like one of those movies were you know its going to be a good movie BUT that ain't the case with this. After awhile this movie just got real boring and pointless. And I almost ALMOST!!! checked my watch as many times as I did when watching Avatar
0061537969|4.0|I applaud Garth Stein's choice of narrator (Enzo's cool) and subject matter in Racing In The Rain. I read several reviews of the book by others before deciding to write one, including Bookman, who extrapolated on the subject of abuse by men such as depicted in the story. Bookman wished Mr. Stein to go further with a subject important to him, and his views have merit; the point is, it caused Bookman to write about the matter himself and many people will see it and perhaps if they read his review before reading the book it will make the story better for them. But what Bookman wanted more of is not really what this book is about.<br /><br />Having written about dogs and also literally raced cars in the rain, I recommend Racing In The Rain to all readers who like a good story told in a little different way. It will make you think about important things on several levels, and days later you will remember a line and smile. You will also never be able to look at that friendly mutt at the coffee shop the same way again.<br /><br />John Pappas
B00012BSHG|5.0|I bought this for my grand daughter when she came to spend 2 weeks with us and she had so much fun playing in it. She is 2 1/2 years old and it was just perfect for her and even for my 13 year old grand daughter who jumped in to have fun with the little one. I recommend it but would put a tarp over it to keep the bugs out when no one is in it.
0307269752|4.0|I just want to say, to everyone I've seen who has criticized this book for being too violent or the character being too shallow, I say I think you are wrong. The fact is, violence against women is a lot more common than it is made out to be. And people in power often take advantage of women. So I believe if you think this is too violent,than you aren't really accepting reality. The violence that takes place in the book is not that shocking when you consider the kind of events that often take place in today's society all over the world. And I thought it was appropriate for the story and sent a powerful message.<br /><br />Also, yes, some of the characters ARE shallow and morally ambiguous, but so what??? That's one of the best things about this book, it's honest. Many people ARE shallow and morally ambiguous. Again, to deny this is to deny reality and want a sugar coated description of characters that are not realistic. Most, if not all, people are NOT completely moral. Most people are capable of both good and evil. This book explores this theme, along with how power and corruption often go hand in hand. I loved the book. I will admit about the first 40 pages ARE kind of boring because it delves into the background story of the main male character, but after that it picks up right away and becomes a book you really can't put down.<br />I, for one, like it when a book doesn't shy away from disturbing topics, and goes for something a little darker and unconventional. And that's what this book does, unapologetically.
B00004T0P1|5.0|As a dinosaur fan I have loved this movie for a long time.  It wasn't until recently that I watched the movie again in my older years and realized just how beautiful the music is.  These tracks are a good fit for a story about dinosaurs.  Many of them are exciting, namely \\"Raptors/Stand Together\\" and \\"The Egg Travels\\".  Some are fun and lyrical such as \\"The Courtship\\" and \\"It Comes With a Pool.\\"    If you are a fan of the movie or just a fan of music you will appreciate the music from this film.
1906735875|3.0|In the 21st century Earth's surviving population live in overcrowded mega-cities where order is maintained by officers empowered to act as judge, jury and executioner.  And the toughest, meanest judge of them all is Judge Dredd!<br /><br />For over 30 years this English comic has gone through many phases so people tend to forget it started as a satire of Hollywood heroes and science fiction in general.  So most of the 8 page stories in this book can be summed up as 'cute'.  There are some straightforward action stories, some humor ones, and some plain old misses.  What's interesting is that Dredd is amazingly consistent, his character, personality, even his world in this book are not that different from how they are written and drawn today.<br /><br />With rotating artists and writers this book is a bit inconsistent.  Sometimes you get the great Brian Bolland or Carlos Ezquerra... sometimes you don't.  Since most of these stories were originally in black and white the reproduction is fine, though some of the pages look like they were originally in color and come out a bit muddy in B&W.<br /><br />These stories are not the best Dredd stories, but they're not bad by any means.  And you're getting more than 300 pages for a low price.  So if you're a Dredd fan add a star, but if you're not that into him this probably is not for you.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I love this CD. I already had it, but bought another one just for my car. I love me some Michael Jackson. Rest in peace sweet prince...
B002XMGJIU|4.0|...to say the least because it was also the year Sandra released the album Into a second land, Paula Abdul's Forever your girl, Pet Shop Boys' Introspective, Kim Wilde's Close, Kylie Minogue's debut album Kylie and Michael Jackson and Depeche Mode were still releasing singles from Bad & Music For the masses but this album beats them all because there is absolutely no filler here whatsoever !    All the songs are good. The singles of course I'm not scared (that still sends shivers down my spine 22 years later), Cross my heart and Baby baby but also great hits like When the phone stops ringing, Will you remember, Use Me etc. All of them still sound fresh and original today.    And all of them were singles, I never knew there was so much of them, that's surely why this album is so good, it's almost more a singles collection than a real album.    But CBS Records/Sony Music should be ashamed to still use the same old master for the Cross my heart dance mix. For years, I thought my vinyl record was jumping beats, I even though years later, my CD Single was damaged during my last moving to my new apartment but all this time, it was just a bad original master tape because this mix jumps at exactly the same times in all my editions, at 5'11\\" and as well at 6'39\\". So now I know even Cherry red is not to blame here.     We trust record companies with these jewels, some of them truly don't deserve that trust ! My own singles of I'm not scared, Cross my heart and Baby baby are in better shape than the ones found in the booklet. Record companies are maybe the legal way to obtain the original master tapes but often real fans take more care of these things than big companies, obviously.    I just wished this was a double cd edition because the booklet is great, it has all the lyrics of the songs in the right order (the previous editions' booklet was a mess !:) but the last 2 pages are painful to watch because it shows us all the remixes and b-sides that exists and that we may neverhave on C.D.    Like Cherry Red's release of Kim Wilde albums Teases & Dares and Another Step it should have been a double-cd edition. What about When the phone stops ringing, Will you remember, Stay with me, Dusted extended versions etc... so much is missing. It's the second time I've bought this cd because I love it so much and I'm ready to buy it a third time if it would ever includes all those marvels. Cherry red lads, you know what to do.    Finally to answer Daniel W. Kelly, the edition I've just bought have rectified the problem you mentioned : it now has the real Dance mix of the song Baby baby in track 14. Thank you Cherry red for that, finally a record company who listens to what the fans have to say.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I did not watch this show the first time it came around despite being a Joss Whedon fan.  I just experienced too much BAD science fiction that I didn't give it a shot.  The only regret that I have from buying this series was that there are no more episodes.  Sure there is the movie (which I also highly recommend), but there was something about this family that I fell in love with and I believe the actors when they say it was the best job that they ever had.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I guess this is my official sign up for the Jillian Michaels DVDs Fan Club! I have fallen in love with her intensity. As a former athlete (way back in high school) I have found that the high impact, no-nonsense approach to fitness is the only way for me so, if that is what you need, Jillian has it. I have only been doing the 30 day shred for 1 week and I've lost 3 lbs and have become stronger everyday. At first the muscle soreness deterred me, but this morning when I did all of the push ups on Level 1 without stopping for the first time, I can't tell you how thrilled I was!!!<br /><br />Jillian always seemed to remind me that I could do it and not to give up just when my body wanted to quit and she repeatedly, without being annoying, emphasizes proper form.<br /><br />Only downside is she incorrectly says that the strength sections are 30 seconds of one move then 30 seconds of another move. Actually, it's 30 seconds of 1 move (ie push ups) then 60 seconds of the next (ie squat thrusts) but I'm anal about the numbers so I would notice that and I don't old it against her. It would also have been nice if the rhythm of the reps went with the music but Jillian doesn't seem like the rhytmic type. I guess everyone can't be as coordinated as Cathe Freidrich!
B001FB55HQ|1.0|Besides all of the regular broken things you hear about this movie...    The voice recordings of Sarah Connor were dull and impassive. They sounded like a school teacher discussing apples or oranges for lunch. They lacked a passionate or fiery edge (yes even in their vocies) as shown by Linda Hamilton from T2 or Lena Headey from TSCC? Oh wait, Linda Hamilton's voice was used... and she read her lines how the director wanted her to read them.    John Connor did nothing for this story, his parts could have been all in the background and it wouldn't of impacted the storyline in any way.    Continuity and Common sense were ignored:     Example 1: The T-600 - Kyle Reese said they were covered in rubber skin, which made them easier to spot up close. (Synthetic skin, hair, nails etc. being the last comestic improvements on the Terminator robots - turning them into cyborgs). McG (the director) probably thought he said they were easy to spot because they were 8 or 9 feet tall and had a minigun on one arm. The rubber skin on the movie T-600s was not a disguise at all. It was some rubber sheets draped over their head. I don't honestly believe many pro-wrestlers are EVEN close to being that big or ugly so unless Skynet wanted to infiltrate a Wrestling Federation/Organization it was doing things wrong in Terminator: Salvation.    Example 2: The giant machine which scoops up people from buildings like a fat man grabbing pop-corn... How the hell does something that large sneak up on paranoid people in the future? Especially small communes in the middle of nowhere? Was it wearing a rubber sheet with wrestling tights on?    It has been reported that when the director McG was asked about this film and how it's not up to any kind of standards that he replied with \\"it's just a damn dumb summer action, terminator movie, it's not supposed to be cerebral, it's a pop-corn fantasy flick\\". No wonder Bill Murray punched him out once.    If you hated T3 remember this about TS: The first full screenplay for the film was written by Terminator 3 writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris.    From Wikipedia:  Based on 250 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, critical reaction for Terminator Salvation tended toward negativity with an overall 32% approval rating. Among Rotten Tomatoes' Top Critics, which consists of popular and notable critics from the top newspapers, websites, television and radio programs, the film holds an overall approval rating of 29 percent. By comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 52, based on 35 reviews. At all three websites, the film ranked lowest among the Terminator franchise films.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This CD isn't going to blow you away with its depth of emotion or its lyrics, but it's not bad just as something fun to have on in the background.  She is a much better singer than people give her credit for, but it's her own fault for choosing such shallow songs with no chance to show off her voice.  If you listen to her ballads like \\"Don't Let Me be the Last to Know,\\" you will see that.  She's still not amazing by any means, but she's not the big joke others claim.
B002VPE1OS|5.0|We love these!  They're easy to put on with a little care and a credit card -  no bubbles here, and it really does help cut down on the glare when outside.  I highly recommend that everyone uses these screen protectors for their iphones.

B000I5XOW8|2.0|I rarely write reviews for products although I purchase most of my DVD/Blu rays (used)from various sellers on Amazon so hopefully readers will understand how so truly dissapointed I felt to compose this review. First, The Fugitive is amongst my top 10 movie favorites of all time (I'm 40 years old). My wife surprised me with a Blu Ray player for father's day and I've purchased 13 Blu Rays and this movie as BY FAR been the most dissapointing. I have proably watched this flick 50 times. I know the dialogue almost word for word and know how scenes will finish before they complete so I was shocked at the added dialogue and longer scenes that accompied this version. Perhaps this is a special addition, although it's not labeled that way anywhere on the packaging. Also the (so called) video upgrade is nearly nonexsistant. Of the 13 movies I now own this is the worse (barely above DVD quality) of the lot. With all of the dissapointment I ejected the movie out of my player and put it on the shelf thankful that I still held on to my old reliable DVD which I will turn to when that feeling to watch Harrison, Tommy and company do their thing again for the 51st time.

B002BSHWUU|4.0|I was never really a Beatles fan.  The music didn't really speak to me growing up.  But I wanted a new addition to my music collecting and I decided to buy this box set since it had almost if not all the Beatles music.  I have been listening to the collection as a whole and I am finding gems that I have never heard before.      The only negative statement is that to make the mono track stereo they ended up mixing instruments heavy left and voices heavy right.  This can be distracting.  Not all track are like that.  The collection offers a big bang for your buck especially if you can find it used.

B002ZG997C|4.0|A bleak post-apocalyptic world provides the backdrop for this competent film.  Well-directed by the Hughes Brothers, the movie relies on essential goodness of mankind and an effectively balanced performance by the ever reliable Denzel Washington.  Also the strong support from villains Gary Oldman and Ray Stevenson; Mila Kunis and Jennifer Beals and an uncredited cameo from Malcolm McDowell.<br />The sepia tone enhances the barren landscape and Eli's mysterious secret is well preserved.  One of the better films of this genre in recent years.

0316017922|1.0|The inclusion of charts, graphs, and lists in Outliers suggests that the book will be scientific in its attempt to show significant factors in  the roots or causes of success.  Closer examination reveals, however, that many fallacies in reasoning--for example, reasoning from anecdotes, metaphors, and correlations--throw his contentions into question or at least should make the reader question the significance of what he is saying. However the most egregious fallacy is \\"hypothesis contrary to fact.\\"  Although used frequently in informal speech, this device which postulates what might be true if something else had not happened, proves nothing.  According to Gladwell, the Beatles would not have been famous if they hadn't had a 10 year period of practice, Bill Gates owes his success to having access to a computer lab when he was in school, the first officer of Korean Airlines plane could have landed the plane if he hadn't shown such deference to the pilot. Or consider,\\" If a million more teenagers had been given the same opportunity, how many more Microsofts would we have today?\\"<br />  Gladwell seems to have a New Age or pop sensibility in that he favors intuition over logic, is poor in analysis, revels in the irrelevant, is preoccupied with appearances, thinks you can detect lying from facial expressions, exaggerates the role of culture in health, and dismisses logical argument in favor of provoking thought.<br />  Readers thinking about enriching Gladwell even further by buying his book might consult various reviews: Michiko Kakutani and Stephen Pinker (Harvard psychologist) in the New York Times book review, Richard Posner in The New Republic, and Maureen Tkacik in the Nation.<br />  Some of their criticisms: lack of technical grounding in statistics and psychology; occasionally blunders into spectacular failings; interviews experts and comes to banal, obtuse, or flat wrong generalizations; undermines ideals of intelligence in favor of luck, opportunity, intuition;contradicts himself frequently; frequently amazed or flabbergasted like naive observer.<br />  A couple of Gladwell's statements: Hunter gatherers had a pretty leisurely life; everything we've learned in Outliers says that success follows a predictable course; to build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success with a society that provides advantages for all; the outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all; who we are cannot be separated from where we're from and when we ignore that, planes crash; success is not a random act-- it arises out of a predictable and powerful set of circumstances and opportunities.<br />  In short, Gladwell is a sloppy thinker and his conclusions about success are insignificant--either they're common generalizations or unproven assertions.
0743289692|5.0|I'm a Christian scholar who has written critical things about both Islam (see \\"Can Jesus Save Islam?\\" in Touchstone) and atheism (The Truth Behind the New Atheism.)  This book being about a woman who converted from the one to the other, I approach Ayaam's story with an ambiguous set of biases.<br /><br />Never mind preconceptions, though: whatever your biases, this tale will sweep you away.<br /><br />One of Ayaan's first memories is her grandmother telling her stories; she seems to have inherited the gift.  Never maudlin or sentimental, speaking in a firm, simple voice with an intense but restrained passion, she tells vividly of childhood in Mogadishu and the Somalia desert, \\"imprisonment\\" in Saudi Arabia, meeting her father for the first time as he comes from prison, first love in Kenya, her slow journey out of Islam, and even the deadening life of politics.  Listening to this in the car CD, sometimes I just parked the car after arriving at my destination, and listened.<br /><br />While following the story, you get a feel for the clan system that divides so much of Africa, for advantages as well as disadvantages of the Muslim religious and social system (there were times I agreed with the Muslim in her more than the skeptic, and wondered what we have lost).  The portrait of her conflicted relationship with both her parents, and of her sister's death, is moving.  The description of her first impression of the West is often amusing -- nor do the Dutch escape her quill unscathed.  Her views do not fit neatly into either \\"conservative\\" or \\"liberal,\\" even as a politician.  She always seems to say what she thinks, no matter how much hot water that gets her into -- and it gets her into a lot.<br /><br />As I said, I listened on tape.  At first I was afraid I'd miss part of Ayaan's story because of the accent.  Actually it lent an extra dimension of charm to the recording, though I was sorry I couldn't underline passages for later reference.  All in all, though, a wonderful way to hear Ayaan's story, and really get to know her, I felt.  I'd love to talk to her about her new beliefs, some of which, it seems to me, are based on a one-sided and sometimes mistaken understanding of Western history, and what makes us what we are.  But the simple dignity and frankness with which Ayaan tells her story, and indeed seems to have lived her life, make her one of the most attractive infidels I've come across.really get to know her, I felt.

030726999X|5.0|This trilogy feels current and relevant.  I have not read anything in this genre with a character quite like Salander.  While there is minor distraction from the translation, this series is well worth it.
B001GKJ2FM|4.0|So the first time I saw a production of this I was only about seven years old and I absolutely adored it. When I heard it was coming out as a movie I became extremely excited. But sadly, like many movies, my hopes for it were crushed.     I don't remember much about it but I do remember that the acting WAS rather poor. The story line was good, considering they just took the original and played around with it a little bit to make it good movie material. Notice I say good, not great, material. As for the singing, many who gave this movie a 1 star review mentioned how terrible the singing was. I for one found the singing actually pretty good. Some of it was pretty ear wrenching but for the most part I can't complain. I know nothing of directing so I can't say anything about that.     For a family movie it is a pretty okay present to give to a loved one who enjoys musicals. It is not nearly as good as a classic like The Sound of Music, but it's still a \\"going to see eventually\\" movie. My friends, and family, all very much enjoyed it.

I remember seeing the movie on opening night and being floored at the sheer power of the score from note one, and trust me, these tracks do not disappoint when listened to at full blast. One thing that is really great is that on the CD, the tracks lead into each other seamlessly! It's like being at a symphony orchestra almost. Whereas the soundtrack for TDK was a great... superhero soundtrack, this is a great soundtrack in general seeing as it's really epic and dreamlike. Songs like Dream is Collapsing, Mombassa, Dream Within a Dream make for great actioners, whereas songs like Waiting for a Train and Old Souls are relaxing, X-Filesesque, surreal tracks. This will make you feel like you're dreaming for sure! If you like the TDK score, this will wow you more with its sheer diversity. A great score for a great movie!
B002ZG97RE|5.0|Once again Matt Damon does a superb job keeping us on the edge of our seats. Plenty of action and excellent support cast make it a great ride (almost to much with the bouncy camera). The truth about the cover up of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) will be viewed with bias just as it was before. Those that believed in the administration right or wrong will call it lies, and those that have open minds or were against the Bush administration will call it an expose. Whichever camp you are in there is no denying it was well written, casted, directed, and executed. When I first heard no WMDs were found during the initial searches in Iraq it did not surprise me. It wasn't so obvious to some as to the propaganda perpetrated by the administration to gain support for the lifes and money that would be lost and that are still being lost for the Iraqi war. Calling it Operation Shield and Freedom doesn't change the fact it was no more than a means to remove an evil man from power only to try to impose our own governments desires. Based on this one has to ask why was Bush re-elected? Although I appreciate this story coming to light I would have to say I wish it had come sooner. Nonetheless it is well worth seeing this movie to get a better picture of all our in-fighting, mistrust, and ignorance on both sides. Even those that hated the Republican Guard did not do themselves any favors by the support for the immediate dismantle of the Iraqi military. If it had been then why almost eleven years later do we still have military in Iraq? Years later they finally tried to reinstate the military and police so that we can withdraw. What does that tell you? The military advisors for the movie did a great job in portraying how our soldiers give service to their country. My prayers go out to those with friends and family that lost loved ones and those that have someone still stationed there. Good quality DVD picture and sound.

B001W63DX2|5.0|Flight 666 is an amazing rock documentary centering around Iron Maiden who've not only survived 34 but are still extremely relevant. This movie globally captures Iron Maiden on tour & is alluring enough to even non I.M. fans. Undoubtedly already cast in stone as one of the all time greatest bands, Flight 666 is at the pinnacle of arena rock. And for those who've never seen or heard I.M. live, the bonus disc is a plus.
0743289692|4.0|Unlike Ayaan Hirsi Ali I grew up in a loving home with the right to practice religion freely.  I was able to read Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte and dream of falling in love and marrying some day - knowing full well that the man I chose would be one I loved.  The concept of abuse was foreign to me as was the idea that young girls were being genetically mutilated in countries across the globe from me.<br /><br />As with all memoirs, I'm sure that there are parts of this book that were embellished as well as glossed over - but that does not distract from the powerful story that Ayaan tells.<br /><br />Before starting to write this review (and while taking time to gather my own thoughts) I decided to read a few others, and while the reviews were interesting it was comments that really caught my eye.  In the comments people were attacking one another based on their own religious views.  I read attacks on Muslims, Christians and Mormons and marveled at the strength of a message and of one woman's words to be able to incite people so angrily.<br /><br />One review in particular had me a bit confused.  It stated that, in the end, Ayaan turns away from God.  I did not get that message from this book.  Instead I saw a woman who was crying out for God wanting to understand why, in their interpretations, men were given license to abuse and mutilate women in the name of their faith.  This was Ayaan's life; things that she experienced, and while I did not read this book for \\"pleasure\\", I did read it to be informed and to have my eyes opened.  Seeing the world through Ayaan's eyes only causes me to feel grateful and thankful for my own world and to pray in my own faith and spread the word to help fight against the abuse of others, be they women, children or men.
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|The attractive and well-made AmazonBasics Camera Case is a universal fit for most P&S/compact cameras.<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />- Quick Velcro Access<br />The velcro-secured front flap allows quick access to your camera or other electronic gadgets.<br /><br />- Roomy Front Pocket<br />The front pocket is roomy enough for a spare battery and several CF or SD memory cards.<br /><br />- Univeral Fit<br />The roomy main compartment will fit almost all P&S (compact) cameras, save the bulkier models like the [[ASIN:B002LITT56 Canon G11]] (which measures 4.4 x 3 x 1.9 inches), for example. (The internal dimensions of this case are 3.15 x 1.57 x 4.73 inches.)<br /><br />- Velcroed Belt Loop<br />I love the ease with which the case can be attached to (or detached from) my belt. The velcroed belt loop make fastening/unfastening the belt loop a breeze!<br /><br />- Simple and Attractive Design<br />The case has a simple but attractive design. The rubberized AmazonBasics Zipper just screams snazzy!<br /><br />- Quality Case<br />The case is well-stiched and looks to be very durable.<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />- Minimal Padding<br />The case offers little padding for protecting your device against drops or hard knocks.<br /><br />- Deep Front Pocket Not Ideally Suited For SD/microSD Card<br />The front pocket may be a little deep for SD/microSD cards. It requires a little digging to get these cards out.<br /><br />---<br />In sum, what I love most about this case is the velcroed front flap, which allows quick and easy access to your camera. The velcoed belt loop is also a nice touch. If you're looking for a simple case for protecting your camera from light bumps and scratches, this case is definitely worth consideration.

The Interviews are fantastic! It was so nice to see most of the characters taking part in it... From what I could see from that, the show holds nothing but fond memories for all involved.

B001GCUO5M|1.0|Shutter Island, 2010 film    The story is set in \\"Boston Harbor Islands 1954\\". A ship sails in the fog. A passenger is seasick. They both smoke. [No FDA warnings?] The island is a prison for the criminally insane. There was a fort from the Civil War time, now used for the most dangerous prisoners. The two Federal Marshals are there to search for a fugitive. Dr. Cauley made this a unique institution. Rachel Salender escaped last night. She is a war widow who murdered her three children but believes they are still alive. How did she escape from a locked room? The guards are questioned as a group about Rachel. Her primary doctor left the island in the morning. The talk in Dr. Cauley's apartment drags. No cooperation? Teddy Daniels has dreams of the past (a nightmare?). Should patients get lobotomies [never proven to work] or doses of thorazine to make them tranquil?    Patients are interviewed. [Is this believable?] Is this for comedy or satire? What kind of glass does Mrs. Kearns drink from? We learn why Teddy Daniels chose this case. Where did Andrew Laytes disappear to? The storm blows down trees. Daniels recalls his past in the war at Dachau. [Were those guards really shot after they surrendered?] Daniels tells about George Noyce and how he was put in Ashcliff. Can he be believed? [Daniels trusts his co-worker.] Is there a ruse to put them there? Rachel was found. They talk to her, she acts crazy. Teddy has a migraine, and more dreams. [The film begins to drag again.] A scream starts a new dream. \\"See!\\" Teddy dreams of his wife again. Then they visit Ward C, the oldest and most dangerous ward.    Andrew pops up for a dramatic surprise. There is a fight. A guard shows up. Teddy wanders off, and finds George Noyce. \\"They knew.\\" [The film starts to drag again.] Is the story credible? What is happening on this island? Teddy wants to see the lighthouse. [Wouldn't a lighthouse be located on the top of that island? Would Teddy climb down those slippery rocks? The real Rachel Salender is hiding in a cave. [Food and water?] She asked about sodium amytal shipments and lobotomies. Could patients be brainwashed into automatons? \\"Any funny dreams or trouble sleeping?\\" [Is this the message of this movie?] \\"You'll never leave here\\" says Rachel. The guard says \\"God loves violence\\". Teddy was wandering.    Dr. Cauley tells Teddy he had no partner. A doctor meets Teddy. \\"Don't go, Teddy.\\" Hallucinations? [Swimming in ice cold water?] Guards with rifles? Teddy climbs the stairs to the top of the lighthouse. Chloropromazine for the past 24 months? [Can you believe the ending? Isn't it too incredible?] \\"We're telling you the truth.\\" There is another flashback to years earlier that explains it all. Or does it? [Unbelievable?] Just when you think this film can't get any worse a shot is fired. Then we are back to the present to hear the confession. \\"We're too smart for them.\\" So Teddy goes for a walk.    This movie didn't fool the people, audiences stayed away from it after the first week. Was this the worst film since \\"The Runaway Jury\\" or \\"The Blair Witch Project\\"? This is a first rate production of a third-rate story. Should the director retire already?

B0011NVC9I|5.0|I suggest to watch \\"The Origins of Beowulf\\" found in special features, especially before watching the movie. You can hear from the screenplay writers about what they were after by modifying the known version of the legend. In essence, they say, they stripped off layers of scum and presented the original version to your attention. And that is what makes the most of the value of this work - the original story is the eyeopener for those who dares to think without an aid.     One needs to understand the metaphors planted in the resurrected story to appreciate the effort of this team. The main idea is that once a man of any background gains the spoiling power of a ruler, he will ultimately face the \\"seduction\\" of a beast. This beast shows up as Grendel's mother in the play, but it is really a dark side of a human's nature that puts the pressure to make a deal with the own conscience towards corruption and against righteousness. All the kings in the play could not resist such pressure, even those seemingly true and unspoiled.  Like metaphors in this story are countless, though, again it requires an independent thinking ability to reveal the true meaning.     This legend was made up back in times when Celtic nations lived in a different type of society, namely Druidic or Vedic culture (it is even before the pagan or any other occult faiths). They put a wealth of knowledge about the human's nature to this story probably hoping that it will be a warning to the people of what kinds of dangers they can encounter in their lives. Yet the story was manicured by the later tellers to make it into a simple tale about heroes defeating monsters to hide the essence.    Happy watching to all of you.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I picked up this book wanting to read more of a history of North Korea. Instead the author wrote it as a \\"Day in a Life\\" of a few North Koreans. I got sucked and connected with their personal stories and just had to know what was going to happen next.

B001S86J2Q|5.0|I'd forgotten what an enjoyable film this is.  Nothing to deep or complicated here, just a fun high school romp.  John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John help make this the classic it is.     I think this is definitely worth getting in Blu-ray.  The menu was extremely well done and easy to navigate.  The transfer is stunning, sharp and clear with excellent black levels and colors that pop without being over saturated ... and the sound was as good as it gets, giving the songs all the fullness they deserve.      This would be a good way to show off your new HDTV!
0307454541|2.0|Note:  I should say at the outset that I enjoy mystery fiction, and have read a great deal of it.  My favorite authors are the likes of Chandler, Cain, Jim Thompson, Ellroy, Elmore Leonard, and Michael Connelly.  If you know those folks, you know where I'm coming from.<br /><br />While on a recent business trip, and desperate for some reading material to while away time, I foolishly spent money on this bestseller, largely on reported sales alone (\\"5 million Europeans can't be wrong!\\")  While it's not trash, I found its only real attraction to be the \\"whodunit\\" aspect of the mystery presented. After one read, I have no interest in picking it up again (better to have checked it out from the library - thus the wasted money).<br /><br />I found the writing leaden (I doubt this can be blamed solely on the translator), the characterization shallow, and the narrative glacially slow.  It's not that I don't have the patience or intellectual acuity to follow a long, finely developed plot with multiple characters - but this stuff was frankly dull.  As many other reviewers have noted, I found myself skimming ahead just to find out what was going to happen, muttering \\"get on with it already\\".  I wouldn't have done this if the characters or subplots were of anything more than marginal interest, or the writing had enough style to be enjoyable in its own right.<br /><br />As I've said, the one attraction was the whodunit - essentially the classic \\"locked room\\" mystery.  What happened to the girl who disappeared 40 years in the past?  The story of these events and their solution is the core of the novel.  Although this author is being compared to numerous top American mystery writers, most of the latter (certainly any of those mentioned above) could have told this core story in half as many pages, with a style I'd actually enjoy reading - perhaps more than once!<br /><br />Of the two main characters, I found only the female computer hacker interesting, although very sketchily described. (Presumably her character is more fully fleshed out in the later books).  The male protagonist is a pompous ass - almost a mirror caricature of the Mike Hammer-style tough guys from the 50's.  Those detectives in the past were right-wing he-men, hard drinking, who would \\"love em' and leave em'\\" without a second thought.  Here we have an investigative journalist in the world of finance - virtually an archetypal left-wing role model - who seems to exude an aura that leads any woman within 5 miles - married, single, whatever - to crawl into his bed and seduce him.  Later, so he doesn't have to face any potentially disturbing commitment issues, the woman breaks off the relationship, all the while maintaining a seemingly noble attitude of detached sophistication.  Yawn.<br /><br />Although there is a goodly amount of sex in the narrative, it is emotionless and is described so blandly as to resemble a medical chart of a patient's bowel movements.  The descriptions of the historical crimes of sexual violence also seem to be taken from a news report - there's no compelling tie-in to the psychology of the killer, or the back stories those crimes represent.  Finally the climax of the mystery - the discovery of the murderer - falls completely flat, as he obligingly commits suicide immediately (those Swedes are nothing if not well-mannered!)<br /><br />The only final loose end is the fate of the missing girl, which is tied up in another couple of chapters.  A tightly written mystery would have stopped there. Here we are dragged onward through chapter after chapter concerning the investigative crusade the male protagonist is undertaking against the archetypal Evil Capitalist (he rapes women!  he sells guns to terrorists!) until through the deus ex machina of the female hacker's apparent ability to infiltrate and control virtually anything on the internet with the click of a mouse the villain is brought down.  Since the book opens with the first round of this confrontation,we are lead to conclude that this is the real subject of the novel, and the whodunit story gradually evaporates into thin air.<br /><br />Part legitimate mystery, part sociology term paper, and part screed in appreciation of European leftist sophistication, this book lacks focus, cohesion, and style.  I doubt I'll be looking at its successors.ubject of the novel, and the whodunit story gradually evaporates into thin air.

B000005J56|5.0|I first became aware of this album when I watched the Buena Vista Social Club movie.  I was intrigued by the fact that Ry Cooder and his son traveled to Cuba and looked up the musical masters that time forgot. Although each of the musicians on the album had reigned supreme in their musical genre of choice, they were all but forgotten in modern times because they lived in Cuba and were effectively cut off from the rest of the world.  Fortunately, Ry Cooder succeeded in bringing their magic to a whole new generation and to audiences that they might have otherwise never reached.  Some of the songs are achingly beautiful love songs while others are meant to get you up and dancing.  This is by far one of my favorite CD's.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|Nic Cage plays a very quirky guy who seems to just be floating along in life.  You find out very quickly that he has a sixth sense about him while he is at the black jack table.  He gets into trouble, but you see him ducking in and out of harms way with extreme ease and wonder what it is that makes him able to do so.<br /><br />In one scene you see him fighting against someone, and then you see that person again, here is where his talent is revealed.<br /><br />Suddenly, the FBI is looking for him.  How do they know about him and his talents?  Also, the enemy is looking for him too?  I must have missed something because I am not sure how they know about him at all.  You see Julianne Moore as the lead FBI agent on the case, she is just great, intense, professional and inflexible in what she is doing.  Each scene keeps you wondering if you are seeing the reality or a flash forward two minutes into the future.  So, there are definate surprises throughout the movie because of this.<br /><br />Although from the same author as the Minority Report and Total Recall, there are definate elements that you have with a surprise or two, yet this is so much less so a full blown scifi thriller as it has little related to that since it not a futuristic movie.  Cage is just a guy with a gift.<br /><br />Jessica Beil is one of his visions, and with her he can see further out for some reason.  When he finally meets her there are some very funny scenes that are 'replayed' that look like great outtakes.<br /><br />The movies climax is just great, the last  1/2 hour is a definate intense thrill.  He goes from the rim of the Grand Canyon to Los Angeles as one long avoidance of disaster.  His gift keeps him safe, so he is almost like a superhero and that is what makes the movie so fun.  The end is a real cool surprise, worth the price of the DVD or at least a rental.<br /><br />I prefer to acquire the movie because there is so much in it.
B0000041Q3|5.0|I will comment only on the sound quality of the recording since, as others have indicated, it will be revered as a work of musical art centuries after we are all dead. The 1973 Decca recording of Turandot represents the pinnacle of the art of analog stereophonic recording, as anyone fortunate enough to own a pristine vinyl copy of the recording will attest. There is only one problem, and a very serious  one--the digital remaster from which the CD is made, I believe from 1990, pales in comparison to the analog master-tape, if indeed it is derived from the master at all, and not a second or third generation sub-master.    I am fortunate enough to own a very high-end system, and I hear detail, harmonic complexity, depth, and presence on my vinyl copy that is simply not present on the CD--and it results in a far less satisfying listening experience.     Digital sound technology has evolved light-years since 1990, and this recording needs to be re-mastered in 24 bit/192khz and reissued in the SACD Hybrid or Blue-Ray format, as befits one of the finest achievements in the history of recorded sound. Decca owes this to future generations of listeners--as analog masters are deteriorating as they increasingly age. This masterful recording, in its original analog form, represents for many, including me, the sound equivalent of reaching the summit of Mt. Everest--it may (rarely) be equalled, but never surpassed.
B003QI95Y0|5.0|My taste for Clutch's music faded in and out for a while, so I never took the time to check out From Beale Street To Oblivion beyond the single \\"Electric Worry.\\" Imagine certain frustration when the album, Blast Tyrant and Robot Hive/Exodus all when out of print when their former label DRT Entertainment went under along with other band's albums. It's a good thing that Clutch thought about those albums when they started their label Weathermaker Music. Here we have From Beale Street To Oblivion in a deluxe edition, remastered, and with a bonus cd with live tracks from their BBC and Australia recordings. The packaging is also very nice. A lot of their recent albums including live albums and dvd's have all been in digipaks. This one is no different, and I think it's the coolest one so far: a nice digipak with a black slipcase which is open in the front so you can see the original album artwork in it's glory. This is a fine album. So if you're like me, and you never got the chance to listen to it, it's the perfect time because it's back in print, and it's one you have to hear.<br /><br />Also check out the new deluxe editions of Blast Tyrant and Robot Hive/Exodus, out later this year.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|In theory, '1' is a great idea; collect all the Number 1 singles from one of the greatest bands in pop history on one disc. Not only would such an album be an exceptional collection of music, it would also be very useful for fans, given the haphazard nature of some of The Beatles' compilations, and the fact that many of their singles never appeared on studio albums. And that's exactly what '1' delivers, all 27 (!) of the Fab Four's singles that reached #1 in either the UK or the US (or, often, both).     From an artistic viewpoint, there is certainly no arguing with the music here. This is simply some of the greatest music not just of its time but ALL time. From catchy pop songs, to folk-influenced minor chords and introspection, to ambitious psychedelic epics, The Beatles redefined the idea of what a rock band could do. Every song here is a classic, from the simple 'Love Me Do' to the sweeping orchestration of 'Penny Lane'. The songs are presented in chronological order, allowing us to follow their increasing ambition and complexity, and the packaging is generous, with a collection of photos from every era and a short essay by George Martin.     But as a collection, '1' falls just short of being the definitive collection it wants to be. I know it sounds very churlish to claim that an album containing 27 outstanding songs is lacking something, but it must be noted that some very important tracks are missing.  Collecting only those singles that made #1 means the album leaves off songs that fell just short of #1 ('Please Please Me', 'Strawberry Fields Forever') or that formed the B-sides ('I Am The Walrus, 'Revolution'). There is no question that these four songs are an essential part of The Beatles' legacy, and their absence is noticeable as the album plays. For this reason, I would still recommend the 'Red' and 'Blue' collections ahead of this one, plus of course the original studio albums.      So I've got mixed feelings about '1'. Everything that's here deserves to be, and having so many important singles on a single CD is handy. But by definition the album is not quite as strong and comprehensive as it could be, and I can't recommend it ahead of 'Red' and 'Blue'.

B001OQCV2O|5.0|First a rant about reviewers.  Why do you review a movie, moan, piss, and WHINE if you know you DON'T LIKE that type of movie?  Reviewing a movie to take cheap shots at actors, acting, etc. of a great movie is sad and pathetic.  I don't review chick flick/romances because I don't like them, thus it would be unfair for me to whine like most do and review them.  If you can't keep an open mind and review a film fairly, then shut up and quit reviewing movies badly.    Now the review:  First off this IS a disaster/end of the world movie.  There is sadness, death and destruction.  BUT what I love about this director is that is is NOT all there is to the movie.  Many things are just well written to show us how we are humans are flawed and when we come together it works out in the end.  Just like The Day After Tomorrow, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and just doesn't stop.  Really, this movie DESTROYS The Day After Tomorrow.  I didn't think 2012 would be the best Disaster movie ever TO ME, but it is.  It is a long movie and should be, to not rush the story.  GREAT character development and shows who is \\"evil\\" and who is \\"good\\" and shows human nature.  The religions tones are great and don't rub any religion the wrong way unless you are just to uptight and sensitive.      *BEGIN SPOILERS*  I see many whine on here about the government getting saved, well DUH!  Who would pay for such an undertaking?  You also see the evil people in the government get saved, the good people stay and help.  The religious tones are GREAT.  I loved the crack between Adam and God in the Sistine Chapel, which was just one that showed us that as humans we separate ourselves from each other and the divine and in the end, we should come together.  Other religious places are destroyed not just Christian ones.  Nobody should be insulted, it is a message to bring us all together.      The special effects are mind boggling, from volcanoes, to earthquakes etc.  It is just awesome.  Seeing the citiesfall apart, dumping people, whole building and such around is destruction never seen on film like this before.  Tidal waves are monstrous and all the ways the earth is ravished makes you just say \\"wow\\".        *END SPOILERS*    The only negatives is the science in the movie about HOW the earth is going to crap.  Not really sound, but just ignore it as it is not there very long.  The other thing the main characters cheat death a LITTTTLLLEE to much, not to bad, but it was like \\"Ok, yet another close call.\\"  Not bad, but maybe a few to many.      2012 is based on a real theory/belief that the Mayans thought the world would end on December 21, 2012.  You don't have to believe it to enjoy the flix.  Shut up, sit down and enjoy it on blu ray and turn the surround sound UP.  Stop nit picking the movie and see the true meanings in it, and you will see the movies real meaning.
B000002NJM|5.0|The Music from Jackie Brown is the underlieing theme of the movie by Quentin Tarentino.<br /><br />Listening to this music lets you identify with the characters from the movie and where in the movie the music is from.<br /><br />You can just close your eyes and imagine what the characters are doing and their goals.<br /><br />Just great.
006145205X|4.0|Zoologist and science writer Matt Ridley makes the case that things are getting better, not worse.  His quite substantial background as a scientist comes into play as he marshals data to show that predictions of impending overpopulation, resource depletion, etc., are unlikely to be correct.  His equally substantial background as a writer is on display in his lively, frequently humorous prose.    I give the book four stars instead of five because Dr. Ridley does not address the dangers of nuclear weapons in the possession of rogue states or terrorist organizations.
1416526242|5.0|That title may scare you off but this is a true story of a remarkable African woman who overcame great odds to make a truly distinctive life for herself.  It is well written and reveals in a heart-rending way what it has been like to grow up female in Somalia.  Fascinating.
B000007VCO|5.0|Carlos is, bar none, my favorite musician, and Oneness ranks among his finest albums.  It will take you on a spiritual journey.  It combines the best of his jazz-fusion Devadip period with the face-melting leads, piercing sustains and driving Latin beats of his earlier albums.    Why do I call it \\".999 fine\\"?  Because of the one blemish marring an otherwise perfect album: \\"Silver Dreams and Golden Smiles\\".  This atrocious piece with its shooby-doo vocals, amateurish slides onto key, and trite rhymes completely shatters any mystical momentum the listener might have attained up to that point.  What Were They Thinking?      In my vinyl days I seriously considered taking a nail and gouging it across the track so that the needle would immediately jump past it.  I bet the nail would have actually been less jarring.  Ah well, this is the digital era, and it's relatively easy to re-master your own CDs.  So I did.  Voila, no more Golden Smiles for me!  Nirvana here I come.
6305657947|1.0|An unbelivably long and boring movie. Very often I needed to press the fast forward button. A total waste of precious time. I could not believe I even finished the whole movie.
B002VPE1XY|4.0|So far I have tried my flip phone in this case. It fits, but I carry my phone attached to the strap of my very small purse all the time I'm out. I tried this on the strap and the magnetic closure did not feel strong enough for me to feel secure. So I put my phone in its other case and put it in this case and that was worse. The closure really didn't want to close. So if you want a case to keep your camera/phone/etc. safe in a bag, I think this could be the case for you. The leather is soft, matte black. It has a small silver amazon basics logo on the front. There is a little hole on the top for a strap. The hooks and loops on the back is about an inch. That size didn't make me feel very secure, either for hooking it on my purse strap. Also, I like the easy to open packaging.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I only started watching this show because I have a thing for vampires.  And the pilot episode to me seemed like a replica of Twilight, kind of cheesy and campy.  However I decided to stick with the show for a few more episodes.  Man, am I glad that I did.     By episode four, the show had completely drawn me in.  The characters were so well thought out and portrayed so beautifully that I couldn't help but become obsessed.  Elena is a strong, confident girl who is actually able to stand up for herself.  Stefan, who originally seemed very one-sided, breaks out of his broody shell in the later episodes and really shakes things up. Paul Wesley did a magnificent job with the character.  And finally, Damon. Need I say anymore?  Ian Somerhalder deserves thousands of awards for that role.  The character development for Damon literally blew my mind.  He starts off as deliciously cruel, sarcastic, and badass; the perfect villian.  But by the end of the season, you are completely rooting for him.  You are able to understand his motives and truly feel for him.     The plot of the show blew my mind.  It was hard to believe that the writers could cram so much action into one 45 minute show.  The plot twists, especially in the finale, kept you guessing until the very end.  The writers did such a fabulous job with the lines, keeping the characters sounding real, and giving Damon some of the best one-liners on television.  The acting was incredible, and the special effects kept the show unique (although I am glad they ditched the crow and fog after a few episodes).  I would and have recommended this show to just about everyone I know.  It is by far my favorite show on television.  Even if you are not into vampires, this show has so much more to offer.  Just give it a try, and I promise it will draw you in.
0307594777|5.0|Finally a man who can write a well rounded lead female character! I am sick of men and women for that matter either writing unrealistic female heroines, or ones so full of self pity you don't care what happens to them.     I found the 1st book slow starting, but once I made it to page 100 I zipped through all 3 books in a matter of 2 weeks time. I had to ration them out to myself.     I appreciate the quality of the writing, some things get a little lost in the translation, but all in all it's exceptional work with well planned plotlines, tied up loose ends and characters that seem flawed and real. I really like the perspective, the author writes in 2nd, but gives insight to the characters thoughts and feelings. It paints a full picture where you feel like you're in the room watching the volley.     I have seen movies one and two, and they are good stand alone movies, but I am disappointed in a number of changes that were made I found essential in the books. I wish they would have released the film version on tv as a mini-series instead and allowed more time for the story to play out and for us to get to know the characters. I only wish Stieg were around to see the success of his books and finish the 4th of the series. Rumor is he wrote the beginning and the end but is missing 100 pages of middle -- it's suppose to discuss her sister Camilla and take place partly in Canada. Stieg's family and long-time girlfriend are in a legal battle over the manuscript and what should happen with it. I am sad that we won't get to know more of Lisbeth Salander, Mikael Blomkvist and the gang at Millenium but am hopeful 4 will come out eventually due to the success of the previous 3.
0307594777|5.0|Got this set as a gift for my husband, who is VERY discriminating in his reading.  He absolutely LOVED this collection!  He indicated that the story lines are engaging, the plots well thought out, and the writing style fluid.  I would HIGHLY recommend this set to any one who loves a great book!
B003KUSUN6|5.0|Well the Amazon site says its in a 4:3 format. Its actually in 16:9 format and the surprise is they must have used HD cameras in 2004 because  the picture quality is tops and of course far far better clarity than the DVD version. Quite a surprise.  OK some distortion in a couple of songs but if your a Shadows fan and you have a HDTV or HD projector and BluRay player then this is definitely worth getting hold of.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Simply put, this is the best version of Persuasion. The acting and the adaptation are head and shoulders above the recent PBS version. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are excellent as the thwarted lovers and the supporting cast gives the other characters real dimension. This version is not afraid to let Austen's humor and wit sparkle. This is the one you will want to watch over and over.[[ASIN:0984404503 The Smarter Home Office: 8 simple steps to increase your income, inspiration and comfort]]
B002ZG997M|3.0|This was a fairly depressing movie! It was a combination of Mad Max and what the bible teaches about Armageddon.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|A movie that I will watch over and over again.  Thanks for sending it so quickly!
B0031RS58I|3.0|Lexi Smart thinks it's the year 2004 and that her career is going nowhere and according to Lexi her love life is going down the drain. She wakes up in hospital thinking that she has frissy hair and uneven teeth to find that she has perfect teeth, gorgeous hair and a huge wedding ring. There is also the small matter that it's suddenly 2007.    She thinks that she has the dream life when chinks start to appear. This book is written in a very enjoyable style which is immediately recognised as Sophie Kinsella's individual style.The confusion and comedy is visible in every word. I recommend this book as a summer read as it is not particuarly challenging but it is still a great page turner.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I didn't like the first chapter or two, but then the real story began, and I liked it alot.
6304712936|5.0|I first saw this film in my AP European History class (but don't watch it for its historical content :)    I recently bought it and watched it again. It's an excellent film and the acting is superb. Highly recommended!
B001UREJWM|5.0|As usual our veteran rock Gods are still great and heavy as ever on this album.   I'd recommend it to fans new and old. Ronnie's vocals are as always powerful,  the lyrics are full of meaning, and the band is a driving force that really  brings it home. Buy it today FANS!!!
B0029LX2LC|5.0|What can you say about that rare cd that you can't stop listening to.  This album is great on so many levels from start to finish you can enjoy this record as a whole and appreciate the music and the words. With so much nonsense being released today this is a breath of fresh air.  Highly recommended!!!!!!!!
B0013XS8A2|5.0|This is a great album release \\"Music Of The Spheres\\" by the legendary multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield : interpretations of the music created by the movements of the planets & influenced by \\"Tubular Bells\\" music to create a wonderful masterpiece. Notable solid tracks are \\"Harbinger\\", \\"Silhoutte\\", \\"Animus\\", \\"Aurora\\" & \\"Musica Universalis\\". It has 14 songs (though three are repeated as \\"reprise\\"), great sound & musical artistry of a very high standard, a highly recommended listening to Mike Oldfield's fans & as well as new ones.
B002GYS1FO|3.0|Purchased on expectation of good music. I Liked:  \\"How you like me now?\\" from the KIA Super Bowl commercial. Searched the group out on You Tube.  I thought the How you like me now video was pretty cool.  So, I purchased the album. I was disappointed with the rest of the music on the album. Didn't really care for any of the other songs that much.
B000MCIBAW|5.0|Jim Morrison at his best, the band is still developing and was always lucky to have front man with Morrison's sense of humanity
B002M2N9JI|5.0|This entire album is everything one could desire from music.  Meaningful lyrics, awesome sounds, and an interesting voice singing.  I heard of La Roux because of the now popular song \\"Bulletproof\\" but I quickly feel in love with all the songs.  If you require easy listening at anytime or are just looking for a great CD this is one that you should purchase!
B003K025TQ|5.0|Everyone needs a few CDs in their arsenal to use as, \\"Show Off\\" recordings for their car audio system or home stereo. This is one of them. The mix, clarity and production of this CD is outstanding. Crank it up!    The music is great too. I became a fan of Lee Ritenor after picking up his \\"Wesbound\\" CD on which he pays tribute to Wes Montgomery. But make no mistake, this is NOT a smooth jazz recording. It's a mix of blues, jazz, fusion, rock and even classical. There's something here for everyone.    I HIGHLY recommend this record!
B0015DROBO|2.0|I read the paperback version of this book instead of downloading it on my Kindle.  Could someone with a Kindle please do me a favor and do a search for the word 'coffee' and tell me how many results you get?  I am very curious.  Honestly, I think the number of times that coffee is mentioned in this book is probably its most exciting feature.  I usually do not read blockbuster fiction but I read a review on NPR about how this trilogy features strong female characters with undercurrents of feminist philosophy.  Huh??!!  I really don't think so.  Salander is an interesting character, I will give her that and yes, she does have some redeeming strong qualities but her character is completely carried by male characters in the novel.  The almost gratuitous violence and sexual assault against women in the novel was repulsive and did not add any depth to the plot.  By the end of the novel, I was skimming the pages to see if any aspect of this novel would turn out to surprise me.  I really wanted to like this book but in the end, it has turned out to be just like any other runaway bestseller that has been read by millions simply by the magic of good advertising.  So, I think I will go have myself a cup of coffee and find another book to read.
B0006M4SO6|3.0|3 1/2      I personally gravitate towards these huge thematic servings- even if there are more than a few overthought sections, to not be emotionally pulled during many of the articulate climaxes would be a heartless crime of the ear.
0399156577|3.0|This was pretty disappointing for a Nora Roberts book.  Usually I inhale her books the day I get them, but this one didn't hold my attention.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't engrossing.  It took me a couple days of picking it up and putting it down before I finished it.    The beginning chapter was really interesting.  It really helped get me in tune with  what she did for her Search & Rescue job.  I didn't mind all the details of the training for the search and rescue, most of it was interesting, but I didn't really enjoy so much detail spent on her job as a dog obedience trainer.  It was very tedious to me.  Maybe if I was a dog lover I would have more patience with it, but as it stands I found it incredibly monotonous.  I was turned off by the thought of being expected to devote my entire life to my dog if I wanted them to be well behaved.  *Shudder*  Then we spent page after page having that belief drilled into our heads.  It was just too much.      It wasn't only the details about the dog training that I found irritating, it was the dog trainer too.  She held this faintly superior air that set my teeth on edge.  In the beginning whenever she talked to Simon about his dog and how he was the one failing the dog she sounded really snotty and superior.  Maybe all dog trainers think they're above all the regular dog owners?  Then again, maybe not.    I swear, any situation that popped up seemed to be no match for the awesomeness of the behavioral specialist.  This woman even outclassed all the police and FBI combined.  She knew everything because she worked with dogs, and we're all exactly like dogs, you know?    Simon was a character I wish I got to know better.  He was so cute and grumpy.  I loved that he liked Fiona despite himself.  He didn't want to get involved with anyone.  He just wanted to hide out in his house and be left alone.  He didn't want to have to comfort anyone and he definitely didn't want someone depending on him.  It was cute watching him rush todo something sweet and then try to brush it off like it was nothing.  It's too bad that there seemed to be so little focus on him.  I never really felt any depth to him.  The bones were there, but I never got to the meat of him.    I was tolerating Fiona and trying to ignore her irritating habits, but after she starting staying with Simon, because of an unfortunate situation, she started getting on my last nerve.  Fiona is a freakishly clean and organized person.  Whenever Simon stayed at her house he respected her unspoken wishes and cleaned up behind himself, even though he's a naturally messy person.  When they're in his house she can't show him the same respect.      I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, who wouldn't want someone to clean their house, right?  But it was a big enough deal that Simon brought it up in the beginning and told her to leave his stuff alone and not to clean anything.  Why couldn't she show him the same respect that he showed her?  She organized his freaking drawers!  Does that not strike anyone else as crossing the line in someone else's home?  Also, when his phone rang she picked it up and chatted with his mom on it.  I was just flabbergasted that she didn't see any of that as pushy and crossing boundaries.  She wasn't even my girlfriend and I started to feel claustrophobic thinking about living with her.    Simon and Fiona's relationship was a little odd.  He kept talking about making compromises with her, but he seemed to be the only one who was doing any bending.  Fiona never seemed to have to sacrifice any behavior or belief like he did.  Also, he knew that she was subtly training his reactions like she would a dog.  He would get ticked thinking about it and go to confront her, but somehow it would fizzle out.  It really bothered me, because I could see her doing that abnormally patient dog whisperer thing.  You don't treat your boyfriend like you do your dogs.  There were just way too many dog similarities to Simon in this book.    Even though I did have problems with the book, mostly Fiona, I did find parts of it entertaining.  The dialogue between Fiona and Simon was pretty funny.  Really, Simon's internal thoughts about his dog and his relationship were pretty funny on their own.  I liked Fiona's friends and I really like the glimpse at Search & Rescue.      I just wish I could have liked the book more.  I also wish that Fiona didn't sound like a shrink all the time.  She would start to do something foolish, but the minute someone said something to her about it being a bad idea, she would talk herself through her reaction to discover her hidden motives.  What was making her act that way?  Is it rational?  It was really freaky!  Who thinks like that?    If this is your first Nora Roberts and you didn't enjoy it, I urge you to pick another and try again.  This is really not a good representation of her usual style.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I didn't know if this book would stand a chance or even match up to the exciting Percy Jackson series, but once again I am amazed!!  Awesome book!  Can't wait for the next one!!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Love the Series on TV. My son wanted this book. Bought 1 for him and one for a friend. Both enjoyed the book as much as the TV Series. If you're a fan of the series, you'll probably love the book. Besides it freaks people out when they see the book on your table and it's on TV.
B001HN694K|5.0|Burton, Depp, what could go wrong?  Nothing!  This was a simply wonderful, fanciful journey into the Wonderland we all grew up with, with a twist.  Johnny was superb as always, never disappoints.  Burton has a way of bringing his unique vision to life.  Highly recommended and I hope to see more like this!

0060574216|5.0|After 23 years of marriage, you would think I would totally understand my man. Yet, no, there were still traits that totally drove me up the wall. I kept hearing, well that's just what men do. So, I decided to find out why men do what they do and they just don't seem to get what or why women do or feel things like we do.    Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus was an easy to read, down-to-earth, eye-opening book that seemed to just say it like it is. There was no finger pointing, just the facts on how we (men and women) can better understand and support each other.    I am already using many of the things I learned in my marriage, and my husband is reading it too.    I will make this book a must buy as a wedding gift with a nice note suggesting that it should be read by both partners!

B003K1EYM6|5.0|I found out that the camera connection kit has more uses than just to attach my camera. I use my flash drive to swap files, my USB audio interface to record straight to the iPad, my USB keyboard to type, my sd card to backup files when I am traveling. Money well spent. I live in Jamaica so I can't get access to the apple store so I am subjected to these high prices(Fail). Other than that exellent product to make iPad an even more useful gadget.
0307271862|2.0|\\"The Man from Beijing\\" is a stand-alone novel by acclaimed suspense author Henning Mankell.  The plot centers around a brutal mass murder in a remote Swedish village, but travels around the globe and through time to resolve the crime and explain the motivations behind it.  Unfortunately, a potentially interesting chain of events throughout history are bogged down by too much expository prose on history, economics, and the nature of global power.  Mankell's background as a playwright is unfortunately laid open here, with lengthy sections of ham-handed conversation between characters being used to explain and propel the plot.  And in the end, that plot relies (quite suddenly) on a clunky series of borderline-absurd coincidences and hastily-introduced characters to draw itself to conclusion.  The reader can almost pinpoint the page at which the editor said \\"enough is enough; if you want to write a textbook on the development of China post-Mao, I'll get you that deal, but this novel cannot bear anymore.  Time to wrap this up!\\"      Readers familiar with Mankell's other works will likely find this one disappointing.  He clearly has taken some subject matters that are interesting to himself and slapdashed a plot around them in order to get published.  Given the length of the book, I can't recommend the investment of time for this work that's inadequate as both thriller and commentary.
B001HN694K|3.0|This movie is too long and all that CGI interferes with the story line.  Also very dark.  Thank god for all the really great film noir classics that didn`t rely on CGI or high definiton. Remember when food tasted good without all the preservatives, music wasn`t overworked by computers and big brother wasn`t watching you at traffic lights? Brave New World is here, but just a little later than Huxley predicted.

B003LAH7MU|1.0|I'm a terrific fan of Sting, but this endeavor is a gross mistake.  I'm embarassed for him.  Though the symphonic work is artful, it is a work in poetic disconnection to the original(s) and bears no coherent enhancement of Sting's previous creations.  It brings to mind an aging Rod Stewart who, in his attempt to be his generations Tony Bennett in terms of popular elasticity, has clumsly stomped on his tux.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|Well, like the title suggests... it was good, but left a bit to be desired.  The plot was pretty guessable to use a fake word.  You knew what was coming... you knew pretty much that Cusack and family would make it, and made you wonder when the crust was breaking up, why fly?? Where you gonna land?  Then the giant \\"arks\\" for the mega rich... wow... who would've guessed the rich carry on?  Sorry, seen one, seen 'em all.  But have it now, add it to the rest of the collection.
B001GCUO5M|3.0|I couldn`t wait for this movie to come out on DVD, but was disappointed when it did. Too long and too dark.  Why are the movies today so dark?  It should be viewed a second time to fully appreciate, but who wants to spend over two hours watching it again?  And while I`m on the subject of length, who wants to spend a whole day going over the bonus features of one Blue Ray movie?
0307341550|4.0|I enjoyed this book about as much as I could possibly enjoy a nasty little (as in lean - no filler here) book about a SERIOUSLY screwed up family and the child-murders that bring them together. Flynn is a seriously good writer, and creates a very dark, pessimistic, and one-of-a-kind heroine. Although the ending was FAR from a surprise and a bit abrupt, it was still very satisfying. Looking forward to reading her other book soon.
B002VPE1OS|3.0|I've tried a few different types of screen protectors on my iPhone 3G. This particular model is a hard-plastic kind that is supposed to reduce glare. I haven't really noticed any difference, though -- the screen is still hard to read in direct light. This film makes it a little better, I suppose, but not enough to make it a significant selling point. (I should note that I haven't yet tested it in direct sunlight, since I seldom use my phone under those conditions.)    The film was easy enough to put on. It takes a little practice to figure out how to get any screen film onto the phone, but a few tries are usually enough for you to get the hang of it. The package comes with a \\"squeegee\\" to smooth down the film, but it was too small and flimsy. Just use a credit card instead to smooth out all the air bubbles.    This film is pretty thick, made of hard plastic, so it offers good protection to the phone's screen, but doesn't sacrifice the touch-screen capability. What it does do, however, if cloud the screen slightly, giving it a filmy appearance. Thus the image isn't as clean or crisp as it is without the protector, or with some different kinds of protectors. This isn't a huge problem -- but an ideal cover would provide no problem at all.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|There is a lot of big business, as a backdrop to this story.  Frankly,  I had in my mind a picture of Tony being the kind of fortunate person who whatever he touches turns to gold. After all, this is a guy who three years out of college sold his start up internet advertising business LinkExchange to Microsoft in for about a quarter of a billion dollars, and then last year, sold Zappos to this sight for an incredible amount of money in the billions. Talk about beinbig bucks! What I hadn't however, known until reading the book, were the incredible risks, hard work and sacrifices that Tony made. Like any entrepreneur it took sheer guts, determination and perseverance, a willingness to loose it all in order to win and above all a great passion to fight for what he believed in. I'm going to reread the book and this time with a pen and highlighter as there are insights and points  of brilliance on every page. I highly recommend this book to anyone in business who is passionate about making a difference to the lives of their customers and the people they work with. It's a must read for this year!! I've been a big fan of Zappos for the past three years, have blogged about them several times and often make reference to the great work that they do in my presentations. So I was thrilled when I received an advanced copy from the publishers. I have to admit my expectations were high and Tony did not fail to impress me. Given Zappos' reputation this should not surprise. But what did surprise me was the truly inspirational story of bravery and human endeavour behind Tony's and Zappos' success.
B00005JLCI|2.0|The long and the short of it: Kenneth Branagh's four-hour uncut Hamlet is a brilliant concept that is derailed by its own good intentions. To his credit, Branagh does an admirable job of presenting each and every scene in the order which it was written (or at least compiled.) The actor/director/adaptor-for-the-screen/what-have-you surrounds himself with what may be the finest and most distinguished Shakespearean ensemble cast ever assembled, though many of this fine group are pitiably underused (Dame Judi Dench and Sir John Gielgud as the Hecuba and Priam of the Player's monologue spring to mind.) Blenheim Palace, the film's Elsinore, is almost jaw-droppingly beautiful, and Alexandra Byrne's costumes are equally lush. But where Hamlet falters, it falters enough to render the film almost unwatchable. Director Branagh's decision to do \\"the whole Hamlet\\" is ambitious and perhaps even inspired in an ironic sort of way. But it becomes evident from even the first few minutes that Branagh takes his idea far beyond respect and admiration for the Bard--it's almost holy reverence. I like to imagine Branagh assembling his cast and crew on the first day of production and telling them (to quote an extremely different movie): \\"Guys...we're on a mission from God.\\"<br /><br /> Unfortunately for the viewer, Branagh decides to equate the Ultimate Tragedy with ULTIMATE DRAMA. This means that in the opening scene of the play (which to some degree should set the tone for the rest of the film,) there is not the commonplace, though admittedly tense, changing-of-the-guard scene between Francisco and Barnardo. No, no, to make sure that we feel the DRAMA and IMPORTANCE of the film, poor Barnardo is quite literally jumped by his replacement. This scene (remember, the first scene of the entire play) concludes with a come-on-he's-not-that-spry Jack Lemmon fiercely hoisting a javelin at the not-scary Ghost of Hamlet's father, who is promptly rendered even less scary when one realizes that the curiously motorized movement of the figure is oddly reminiscent of those cardboard cutouts Macaulay Culkin taped to his train set to scare away the burglars in Home Alone. Patrick Doyle's hopelessly intrusive score does not alleviate matters. Quite some beginning, eh?<br /><br /> When the film isn't being melodramatic--which it frequently is, especially in Hamlet's scene with the Ghost, where apparently it's thought to add atmosphere to show the same shot over and over of the earth cracking into pieces and steam billowing from the fissure. A disappointingly overwrought Brian Blessed doesn't help either--it's being stage-y. Which would be fine...if this was a stage production. Consider the court scene at the beginning. The long shot of Claudius and Gertrude (apparently coming straight from their wedding) processing down the aisle with hundreds of courtiers and dignitaries rising to their feet and observing would be absolutely magnificent in a theater (nope, not a movie theater)--you'd actually feel as if you were part of the royal court of Denmark. On screen, it just feels...excessive. One great usage of long shots, however, is when characters are soliloquizing. The lack of quick cuts and other editing tricks really lets you focus on the words and the expressions of the actor saying them. These are incredible actors who aren't just reading off of cue cards.<br /><br /> Which brings us to the acting. Most of the ensemble cast is brilliant; there are precious few wrong turns (Jack Lemmon, maybe. Definitely.) Derek Jacobi and Julie Christie (an age-appropriate Gertrude, for once) play their roles better than any other film King and Queen. Claudius is likable enough initially, and Gertrude is both doting and slightly clueless. It was also nice to see Branagh steer away from the incest theme so common to previous versions. Richard Briers as Polonius nicely does a more sinister version of his Leonato in Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing; he is neither too nasty nor too comic.Kate Winslet's Ophelia is equally good; her portrayal is sensitive without being as innocent as Jean Simmons in Olivier's production. Unlike some other viewers, I don't object to the decision to have her in a straitjacket during her mad scene.  Among the rest of the cast, Charlton Heston and Robin Williams have great dramatic and comic turns as the Player and Osric, respectively, and come off especially well. Alas, poor Yorick, that leaves Branagh. Kenneth Branagh is not a bad actor. Unfortunately, that does not mean he is a good Hamlet. Branagh was terrific as the earnest and intense Henry V (also self-directed) and the bickering yet good-hearted Benedick in Much Ado (also also self-directed.) What he lacks, and what his performance so badly cries out for, is subtlety. His Hamlet does not come across as a deeply troubled man in his twenties, but rather as a petulant, emo teenager. He seems to be perpetually either screwing up his expressive face and screaming his lines or blankly whispering them as if they were the word of God--again, it's Hamlet, not St. Hamlet.<br /><br /> So after five acts, four hours, and more than 4,000 lines, we end up with what may unequivocally be termed a Very Silly Finale. We are shocked, not by the sudden violence of it all, but by the magical properties of Hamlet's SuperSword, which goes zinging across Blenheim Palace like a rocket-propelled grenade to land squarely in Claudius' back. Apparently Laertes wasn't the only one skirting the fencing rules when he selected his foil. And I can say that I was positively stunned when dear Ken didn't start belting a few bars of Andrew Lloyd Webber when he cut that chandelier down (melodrama is melodrama, right?) Finally, militarily correct or no, when Mr. Branagh made the shot of his dead self in the crucifixion pose, I don't think he was trying to impress us with his historical accuracy. St. Hamlet or St. Kenneth? Maybe I was wrong all along.
B0000640VN|5.0|This DVD came to me in EXCELLENT condition.  Don't be afraid to purchase used DVD's from them.  It's great!    This is one of my favorite movies anyway.  The rooftop scene makes me yearn for a romance like that.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|This movie pretty much sums up everything wrong with the movies of the past twenty five years. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, but if you like special effects (made on a computer), wow. Pretty much the same picture as Spielberg's completely awful War Of The Worlds, but without even the minor fear factor of the early parts of Spielberg's production.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is a hilariously funny show and after watching the first season, I was hooked.  The premise of the show is of main character, Ted, who is recollecting and sharing stories to his kids on how he will eventually meet their mother.  So the year is actually 2030 but he is narrating the story on the adventures of when he was in his mid-twenties.<br /><br />Obviously, the meeting their mother part will never come until the series ends but so far, so good.  Each episode is another adventure on the mischievous times he had when he was in their mid-20's. Sharing his adventures are his two roommates, Marshall and Lily, best pal Barney and on and off again love interest, Robin.<br /><br />The setting is similar to NBC classic sitcom FRIENDS where there is a group that hang out too much at a local joint, in this case, a dive bar.  They are also living in NYC.  Each character is hilarious in their own right but how can you not just love Barney played by Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser M.D.)!<br /><br />This is must watch television and like other CBS shows; its a shame they are not available for streaming via Netflix or Hulu.  I seriously think the show would have greater following but if you never watched this, definitely give it shot!

We end up with a girl-girl rip-off of Fatal Attraction, except here the director attempts to be artsy.  Unfortunately, the director's main method of achieving the appearance of art is to have nearly every single line followed by a LLOOOOOOONNNNGGGGGGG stare.  I imagine if you cut out the long stares, the movie would probably run a mere 35 to 40 minutes.  And the enthusiasm of Neeson's students during his lecture is so fake its nauseating. Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore cannot possibly be proud of this one.

0545123283|5.0|\\"Once upon a time, there was a girl named Grace Brisbane. There was nothing particularly special about her, except that she was good with numbers, and very good at lying, and she made her home in between the pages of books. She loved all the wolves behind her house, but she loved one of them most of all. And this one loved her back. He loved her back so hard that even the things that weren't special about her became special: the way she tapped her pencil on her teeth, the off-tune songs she sang in the shower, how when she kissed him he knew it meant forever.\\"<br /><br />In SHIVER, human Grace fell profoundly and passionately in love with Sam, the wolf/boy who lived behind her home in tiny Mercy Falls, Minnesota, and with whom she's had a connection since childhood. But their love seemed doomed, as Sam was destined to spend less and less time as a human until he no longer changed from his wolf form at all, even at the height of summer. That is, until the pair stumbled upon a cure that enabled Sam to stay human forever. Voila --- happy ending. Right?<br /><br />Not so fast. At the opening of LINGER, Sam is charmed by being human even through the cold Minnesota winter, and he and Grace revel in the love they've found. But trouble lurks in the woods that encircle the small town. The new wolves recruited by Beck, Sam's mentor, seem unstable and unpredictable. The cops are asking questions about Olivia, Grace's friend, who has disappeared. Sam and Grace know that Olivia is spending her first winter as wolf, but they can't very well reveal that to the authorities. And then there's the dead wolf that Grace discovers on the edge of the woods. What killed him? And why does his smell linger on her? Is there a connection between the wolf's mysterious death and Grace's debilitating headaches and fevers? Might Grace and Sam lose each other just when they thought they were out of the woods?<br /><br />As in her bestselling SHIVER, Maggie Stiefvater combines romantic tension, fantasy elements, and gorgeously lyrical writing to create a superb love story that just happens to feature werewolves. Readers will revel in Grace and Sam's genuine love and affection for each other, even as they shudder to recognize the forces --- from hunters to vicious wolves to bloodthirsty hunters to overprotective parents --- that threaten to tear the pair apart. Rilke's words, \\"We are not permitted to linger, even with what is most intimate,\\" hold painful poignancy for Sam, in particular, as he grows simultaneously to question his true desires and to realize just how fragile his new life is.<br /><br />Stiefvater's writing is refreshingly grounded but lyrical, its imagery suffused with the colors and scents of the natural world, without the Gothic melodrama that often characterizes some other novels of this genre. Steeped in suspense and soaked in romance, LINGER starts with a happy ending and ends with a cliffhanger that will leave readers panting for FOREVER, the trilogy's concluding volume, due to be published in 2011.<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Norah Piehlusly lyrical writing to create a superb love story that just happens to feature werewolves.

0385504225|1.0|I have read all the novels of Dan Brown but this!!, this is not DAN Brown. It is not a freaking techno thriller but just a history book. It is just a freaking history book for crying out loud!!<br /><br />Anyways, here is my observation.<br /><br />The plot has a truck load of details about Washington's Monuments and Architecture with a really horrible story. The only good twist in the plot is Mak'lah's real identity. Even about that, why would Mak'lah waste so much precious time building his body, getting every inch of his body covered with tattoos and Blah Blah, just to get the pyramid and the BIG SECRET. It was his birthright and his father gave it to him willingly before and would have given it to him again!!<br /><br />Throughout the book, Dan keeps rephrasing the same sentences over and over again like..\\" At that moment, it just hit him in the face...\\" ...\\"..all this time it was right in front of them...\\"..and get this, Robert langdon does not solve much of the puzzles here but Dan Brown's Ms.Hero (Katherine Solomon) solves most of the riddles. Robert just plays along like a dumb saying \\" why didn't i think about that?\\" He is a professor of symbology and she is just a scientist!!<br /><br />OHH!! this is the biggest letdown in the plot!!Peter Solomon describes to Robert Langdon that, it is a lost symbol  that which is protected by the masons for many centuries and flip few pages, he says \\" Haven't you realized yet Robert!! it is a lost word\\" and flip a few pages he says \\" Haven't you realized yet Robert!! it's the bible . It's the holy bible for Christ sake!! (which i should say is universally available everywhere and everyplace then why the hell would the Masons want to hide it for centuries!!!). Freemasons hid the universally available Bible for centuries? Mak'lah dies in this novel without knowing that the BIBLE is the big secret. I am saying, he would have killed himself if he knew that the BIBLE is the big secret. He killed his mother and many other lives, tortured animals, took steroids just to get a BIBLE!!  If at all this bible is special, then Dan does not elaborate at all.<br /><br />Dan describes that this lost word or symbol or \\"THE BIBLE\\" to be a powerful weapon of immense power for which mankind is not ready for yet.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I began eating a little better a few weeks before my knee replacement, lost 12 to 15 lbs. Had a bad reaction to anesthesia and/or pain meds, so I didn't eat for 5 days. The 2nd day home I watched this movie, it made such an impact, I've eaten meat only once since and have dropped another 45 lbs. I FEEL GREAT! I offer this movie to anyone that will watch it, so far all have come away with changed diets, if not lives. The movie doesn't try to convince you to eat a particular way, it just presents the information in such a way that you are at your own will to come to your own conclusion. For me I equate eating commercially processed meat to having to survive on bugs, grubs, and roaches. I've completely sworn off hamburger meat and chicken, unless it's free range. Now it's a game my wife and I play in the grocery store spotting the corn by products in almost all processed foods. It's actually harder finding the ones that don't have any. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to everyone and especially those with health and weight problems.

It is a pity a great film like this went through such a mediocre transfer.
B002RI9VVM|5.0|When I was about 11, I took this book off my parent's bookshelf, because I thought I would liked the mice in the story. I had never heard of John Steinbeck - I am not native English speaking and don't live in America. Reading it captivated me and changed the way I viewed books forever, in a way no other book ever had, and could do since. The writing is so elegant, so simple, so even and uncomplicated that at first it deceives one into believing the story was simply about two brothers and a girl. And it was - simple enough at that age for me to grasp and be moved by it. As a child, this book turned me into a reader of adult books. It was a turning point in the reading choices I made since, and my expectations of literature up to this day. When I read the book again as an adult, it had lost none of the simplicity but gripped me even more deeply, since I could fully understand the tragedy and violence. This book is absolutely essential reading, and I will give it to my children and every child I know. I am eternally grateful that it was written and that I stumbled upon it.
B003L20ICE|5.0|Nora Ephron could take a few cues from Lisa Cholodenko ([[ASIN:B00009MEKN Laurel Canyon]]) on how to write and direct a movie about a recognizable human dilemma and the characters who have to deal with it. Now that I have seen this 2010 dramedy, I feel that this is basically the film that Ephron was trying to make with her 2009 Meryl Streep vehicle, [[ASIN:B0038N9WKU It's Complicated]], a far more conventional comedy that took a long-estranged couple and threw a monkey wrench into their arrangement by introducing a plot device that had them reigniting embers they didn't realize still existed between them. In Cholodenko's film, the situation appears more unique - the long-standing couple, Jules and Nic, is lesbian, and the complicating factor is Paul, the common biological father who provided the sperm that produced their two children, Nic's 18-year-old daughter Joni and Jules' 15-year-old son Laser.<br /><br />Ironically, however, the treatment here, co-written with Stuart Blumberg, is far more textured and universal than in Ephron's dependence on tired stereotypes and slapstick. The superb performances don't hurt either. The multi-layered story feels like a series of illuminations about these five characters. It begins when Joni and Laser decide to track down their sperm donor father without consulting their mothers. Paul turns out to be an easygoing, LA-style restaurateur and organic farmer, and as he begins to insinuate himself into the family's life, the director exposes the confused feelings of a family toward someone who's intractably part of them yet a complete stranger. Jules is intrigued, while Nic is suspicious and increasingly angry at someone she views as an interloper. At the same time, Cholodenko focuses attention on how Joni and Laser discover themselves sexually in a gay family with much of the comedy comes at the expense of Nic and Jules, who spice up their sex life with gay porn.<br /><br />Without resorting to stereotypes, the film succeeds in making this family seem quite ordinary with the kids constantly embarrassed by their moms' emotionalism and need for order. Jules and Nic have a marriage that looks like any straight one of twenty years duration. A certain brittleness has crept into Annette Bening's work of late, although the approach works well in her well-etched portrayal of Nic. She has a particularly strong dinner table scene where she is finally seduced by Paul's laid-back charms, sings a woozy rendition of Joni Mitchell's \\"All I Want\\", makes a shocking discovery in the bathroom, and then returns to the table in an engulfing haze of silent disappointment. As Paul, Mark Ruffalo appears to be doing a variation of the ne'er-do-well character he played in [[ASIN:B00003CXQ4 You Can Count on Me]] but gives him a shaggy, SoCal veneer of materialistic success.<br /><br />In a turn that reminds me a bit of [[ASIN:6304907729 Annie Hall]]-circa Diane Keaton, Julianne Moore plays the character that experiences the biggest arc in the story - nurturing and self-reflective one minute, spontaneous and regretful the next. For an actress often at home in period roles that require her to express repression, this feels like her most liberating work. As Joni, Mia Wasikowska - superb in Tim Burton's redux of [[ASIN:B001HN694K Alice in Wonderland]] earlier this year - has the coltish manner of a young Gwyneth Paltrow and brings lucidity to her maturing character. Growing up from his cherubic turns in [[ASIN:B000E6ES9E Little Manhattan]] and [[ASIN:B00005JPL5 Bridge to Terabithia]], Josh Hutcherson appears to be graduating to troubled adolescent roles with ease. Yaya DaCosta is so strikingly beautiful as the girl Paul conveniently keeps at bay that you almost overlook the serene presence she brings to her scenes. Cholodenko has no problem filming graphic lovemaking scenes, and they don't feel gratuitous to the story.

0887307280|5.0|This is a great book for the person who wants to understand what it takes to make a business succeed.  It is written for the entrepreneur (that's what the E stands for in E-Myth) and it describes the three basic types of people who work in any business; the entrepreneur, the manager, and the technician.  Michael Gerber spends a lot of time explaining how each of these people brings something unique and irreplaceable to the process of running a business.<br /><br />The central theme in the book is that true entrepreneurs are rare if they ever exist.  What typically happens when a business starts is that a technician has an \\"entrepreneurial seizure\\" and starts a business.  Then after the new business euphoria wears off the technician takes over again and since the technician is solving technical problems and not management problems the business is managed very poorly if at all.  This then leads to failure.<br /><br />What most people need to learn, according to Gerber, is how to manage. He then uses a good portion of the book talking about how to think about a business from the perspective of a manager and be successful.<br /><br />The beauty of this book is its simplicity.  If you are looking for a step-by-step book about how to run a business you will not find it here.  Gerber does not go into that much detail.  This book will give you tools for looking at a business from a broad perspective and see if the business as a whole is healthy, and headed in the right direction and what you need to do to make it better.<br /><br />I think that anyone can benefit from this book, not just managers or entrepreneurs.  It never hurts to learn more about how each part works to make the whole operate.

B000XCZGV8|4.0|A real criminal, a real serial killer and his \\"adventures\\". What makes this story interesting is the fact that the police never succeeded and never arrested the killer, in spite of the help of the media in San Francisco. It all amounted to circumstantial evidence and no indictment, not to mention conviction, was ever pronounced, hence no suspect declared and arrested. The case can come out today because all those who were suspected to have played a role in this sinister story are dead or out of the way. That will not change anything anyway because the case is now closed since the main yet undeclared suspect is dead. The real question is to know whether the police, the various police departments concerned did their job properly, if the inspectors did theirs and if their hierarchy supported them. It's always difficult to say especially with the role of the Attorney general or public prosecutor in the area. There are so many elements that may stop an investigation in the USA, particularly elections since the main characters in security forces are elected and local officials are the bosses of the Police. A lot can be said and a lot can be done, or undone or just not done. And that seems to be the case here. The film is slightly slow though and the attempt to dramatize it does not succeed entirely.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID
0307460444|5.0|Martha really does know a better way to do things.  I have made several different types of cupcakes from this book and all have turned out beautifully and were exactly as described in the little blurb above the recipe in terms of texture and flavor.    I read the reviews before I bought this book, and I was a little concerned by the negative ones because I am not an \\"experienced baker\\", and noticed that some people had issues getting their recipes to turn out properly.  I think because of that, I have so far followed the recipe exactly, not just with careful measurements but really carefully executing each step as the book instructs.  I have had fabulous results, so I think when the book says to do something a particular way, it means it.  The cakes flavors have so far been wonderful and the textures have been awesome.  I will say that the frostings I have tried have been mostly wonderful but a couple were super sweet (you have to add a lot of powdered sugar to get the desired texture on some of the \\"glaze\\" frostings), so used way less on each cupcake than the recipe suggested and they were fine.    The pictures are gorgeous and I have not needed to actually decorate anything but the decorating ideas are SUPER cute and look do-able.    I would highly recommend this book, and the carrot cupcakes in it.

0307594777|5.0|When I first heard of the buzz surrounding the Millennium Trilogy, I was intrigued but not quite sure I wanted to read it. Knowing that it had been translated from Swedish to English, my fear was that the Swedish setting (character names and places) would be a bit off-putting throughout an entire novel, much less three novels. Eventually, I decided to pick up a copy of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'. Not only was I wrong about the Swedish setting being problematic, I think it actually added some mystique to the story and enhanced it overall. I have just finished the third book of the series, 'The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest', and I must say I am a bit sad that it's over.<br /><br />About 100 pages into the first book, I was hooked. There was a bit more vulgar language than I personally like to read, but it didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />From what I've read, the author, Stieg Larsson, had begun writing a fourth Lisbeth Salander/Mikael Blomkvist novel before his untimely death in 2004. Someone else may pick up the mantle and carry on with the characters, but I don't think it will be the same.<br /><br />I highly recommend this very engaging, entertaining trilogy!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I own the 7506 from late 90's.<br />The best headphones for mixing (considering their cost) at my work (TV station, audio area)<br />\\"Musical detail levels\\" are present very clear.<br />Only lost the cover from the pad, but still ok to work with them<br />Somebody wants to buy them, If I sell them surely I'll buy another new ones.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|If I had bought Season 1, Volume 1, I would then buy Season 1, Volume 2. (Mr. Spock-type logic.)  Unless I felt generous and gave the first DVD to someone who loves Glee but cannot afford to buy it.  I would then reward myself for my generosity and get the full season on the DVD coming out in September. Or ask for it for Christmas. Regardless of how you get the shows  and the music and the wonderful stories with the best ensemble ever created, the important thing is that you get them . . . if you love them as much as I do.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|I like that this movie recognizes almost nobody is completely innocent in love.  Most adults at some moment use and abuse sex for short term needs, lonliness, insecurities, frustrations, boredom, to assert their independence, or even to hurt a third party or to settle a score.  It also shows how the obsessive need to \\"spill your guts\\" or know \\"all the details\\" can destroy what might have been a lifetime marriage (the movie argues some old secrets have to be kept out of pity or gratitude)  I did however think the sexual component was way overemphasized though.  It's as if none of these adults know which bed they want to end up in and insist upon making it miserable once they finally get there.  There is a great story to be told about fidelity and loss, but \\"Closer\\" doesn't quite achieve it.  Nice try.
032147404X|5.0|Kelby makes it clear from the get-go.... he's not interested in lecturing... he'll just tell you how to do something just like he'd tell a friend out on a shoot with him.  After reading the book, I'd love to go out on a shoot with him.  I learned a lot, I still go back to the book frequently and he is very easy to read.  Great book for digital photography and especially if you own a digital slr.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I LOVED this show.  I can hardly wait until the second season, which won't be until next year (GRRRR).  I hope Andy Whitfield makes a full recovery, as I'm so longing to see him in action again.
1428144552|5.0|I listened to the cd a year ago and didn't grasp the meaning of the secret. After I've listened to the cd for the 2nd time this year, I felt like I understood it better and was able to use the secret in my life.  As of right now I am just testing it and using it towards \\"A\\" grades and \\"my parking spot\\"  and it has given it to me 90% of the time.  It usually depends on how strongly I believe that I have what I ordered in \\"the catalog of the universe\\".  If you listen to the cd you'll understand.  P.S. The background music in the cd makes it so much more easier to visualize. = )
B003CIG7AE|4.0|INFINITE ARMS by Band of Horses is an interesting album that has a variety of sounds.  I've listened to this album all the way through 3-4 times now, and for me it's good background music for the office.<br /><br />Some tracks have an etherial sound with heavy reliance on electronics, others have a solid beat and have a middle of the road pop sound, but nothing that's really going to make you stand up and take notice.<br /><br />I think that Laredo is probably the best track on the album.  It's catchy, has a good beat, and doesn't lag.<br /><br />More than half of the tracks are very slow and seem like they have a kind of musical drawl.  These are the songs that work as background music.  They rely heavily on an acoustic sound and flowing lyrics.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good album, but there are no blockbusters here, or IMO tracks likely to climb the charts.<br /><br />Perhaps the best way to describe Band of Horses is as a way scaled back version of The Weepies mixed with, um, maybe Harry Nilsson?.<br /><br />Again, good, not great, but still enjoyable.<br /><br />4 stars.
B000002G23|5.0|Honestly, I don't think I could sit down to dinner with Sting.  The politics, the environmentalism, the ego....  but I love the music.  I've been a fan of the Police since the early 80's and all else aside they made some great songs and they are all here.  I had the opportunity to see them live on their reunion tour and thought they were fantastic which inspired this purchase.  Well... maybe I could have dinner with Sting... we'd just have to stick to talking music.
B002QGUFWE|2.0|Id pass on Lady Gaga CDS. I think it would be better if she made a Smooth Jazz CD or maybe a Christian CD with no special electronics on her voice.
B00389ZTI8|5.0|The 1st season's first 2-4 episodes of Chuck start off slow, but after that I was completely hooked! The show is very well written, with  witty dialogue moving the plot. The characters are well developed and paired with believable actors. With so much trash TV out there, it is good to see an excellent show worth my time.<br /><br />I bought all three seasons of Chuck from Amazon on Demand, and I have really enjoyed the digital experience. I have used youtube, megavideo, veoh, and those other sites for watching TV/videos, and I must say that it's a great feeling to watch streaming uninterrupted and without time limits. This show was worth every penny.<br /><br />Chuck is a feel good show and just makes me happy! There's something upbeat and chipper that makes it a great stress reliever after a hard day.
B00005JPMZ|5.0|My boys, ages 4 and 6, love this DVD!  Great action and it looks great.
0321687299|4.0|It's hard to find informative books these days because it seems everyone claims to be a Web standards expert, and bookstores are filled with reference books that aren't worth the paper they're printed on. This book is different. It's written by two people who actually know what they're talking about and live and breathe what they're writing; it shows.<br /><br />Many have recently purchased \\"HTML5 for Web Designers\\" by Jeremy Keith. It covers many of the things described in this book and does a very good job, but it's not long enough to go into any necessary and helpful detail as it's only 85 pages. This book only costs a few more dollars and is more than double its size and detail. I'd strongly suggest buying this book instead of that one.<br /><br />\\"Introducing HTML5\\" is far from a stuffy reference manual as it contains lots of little jokes within to maintain the reader's full attention, and there's not so much there to make the book seem silly. The book is, while not overly wordy, extremely informative. Mostly what is the most important part of understanding HTML5 are the semantics that are involved in using the new elements, and the book goes into great detail with plenty of examples on exactly how to markup documents using the new elements HTML5 provides. That's only just a portion of the book. WAI-ARIA, Audio and Video, Canvas, Data Storage, Geolocation, etc. are all also presented in ample detail.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about the book has to do with the printing quality itself. The cover of the book I received has a semigloss treatment on it which was badly applied to the paper as it can easily be rubbed off, leaving unsightly fingerprint marks and abrasions where its been touched. On the contents of the book the printer didn't seem to be bothered by mundane things such as press registration; some of the code examples are difficult to read because of the bad printing quality.<br /><br />I'm unsure if I just received a bad copy, but it's the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. However, content is king, and the content itself is more than worth the price.d of 5. However, content is king, and the content itself is more than worth the price.
0307236722|5.0|I first got this book from the library and loved it so much I had to buy it. I like that it's filled with traditional  and classic recipes that everyone should make at some point in their lives. It conveniently lists and shows all the baking tools you'll need and offers tips for creating the best product. I've never really been a huge fan of Martha, but this book is great!
0439023491|5.0|Following her win at the Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen finds she and everyone she loves is in danger.  Her defiant actions in the Hunger Games finale had incited the crowd to rebellion, and President Snow has warned her to behave.  Just when Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and her family seem to be out of danger, Katniss and Peeta find themselves back in the games, having to fight to the death against each other.  Can their love survive?  Again, Collins has created heroic and memorable characters who will make you cheer for them.  The ending is another amazing cliffhanger.
045122499X|5.0|This is a brilliant book.  First people should read Pillars of he Earth by Ken Follet that is about building a Cathedral in 12th Century, over approx 100 years..  This picks up the story 200 years on.  I was waiting years for this book as Pillars of the Earth was one of the best books I had ever read.  I sent a copy to a friend in Alabama as she also loved Pillars of the Earth.
B002PEP4HI|5.0|Definitly another great book by Mitch. I loved the book especially since I'm not reglious myself it was a great book to read about reglious though.
0143118420|5.0|A couple of years ago, when Elizabeth Gilbert released \\"Eat, Pray, Love,\\" the book became a mega sensation. I have heard a lot about it but never read it. Until now. A movie adaptation of Gilbert's hit memoir is being released next month, starring Julia Roberts and Penelope Cruz's husband. As if that wasn't enough, a movie tie-in edition of \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" was released with Roberts on the cover. In other words, you got me. I wanted to see what all the big deal was about.    \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is divided into three sections--Italy, India, and Indonesia. Each section is further divided into thirty-six anecdotes about Gilbert's time in the country. The title of the book perfectly describes the contents of Gilbert's journey. Divorced and reeling from her break up with David, Gilbert sets out to mend her broken heart and write a memoir about her travels.    In Italy, she eats lots of yummy food and meets hot Italian guys, delving deep into Italian culture and making friends with locals along the way. In India, Gilbert gets close to her spiritual side, while in Indonesia she witnesses alternative medicine and meets the love of her life.  Spending four months in each country, Gilbert chronicles her very busy but equally eventful year. By the end of the book, she's evolved into a different person.     If you're looking for a good beach read, look no further. The writing is light and sensual, making you want to travel along with her. Some of the characters are so interesting, it's hard to believe they're real--which I guess makes for good movie material. But nothing beats the book.

B001FB5634|5.0|A wonderfully done movie.  Imagine the world as you know it being ripped from you.  The very things that we take for granted suddenly become necessary for survival.  I really couldn't say anything better than these two reviewers: chrisr \\"Chris\\" and Val \\"LOTRMatrixHPLostFreak\\".  They captured the way I felt about this film.  It gives us a lesson into humanity when our world of convenience and technology is gone.  Another film that has a similar concept is [[ASIN:B002ZG997C The Book of Eli]].  The films are fundamentally different but touch on the same changes to humanity.  All in all I believe that, like the Book of Eli, everyone needs to watch this and understand the things that are truly important.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought the DVD in April and began by doing level one a few days a week. I then progressed to level two and onto three. I'd say I do a variation of one of the three levels at least four times a week. Levels two and three are very challenging - but I feel great when it's done. I started with light weights and have progressed to heavier ones. I find that after doing the various levels for the last 4 months, I'm able to make it through each one now. They are still difficult and provide a great workout and there's always something I can improve on. I have little extra time in my day and this is the perfect 25 minute workout for me.
0553269631|5.0|To have written such a novel at such a young age amazes me - such insight, though universal, is learned by experience when youth wanes and the rose-colored glasses inevitably have to come off.     The story touches a chord in anyone willing to admit the loneliness felt at certain times in life. Not so much the reality of living but what each of us perceives to be reality and the unfortunate shattering of that perceived reality and how we handle it.     There is hope and it is found in faith in the true God. McCullers's was quoted as saying she wrote to find God. Her searching is quite evident in this work but where one looks and with what eyes one looks with has everything to do with finding Him.
014132161X|5.0|It was always a little strange to me as a boy that children in books always went to boarding school and always had nannies, cooks, and maids, but we just accepted that that was how people were in books. We realised that books were written before decimalisation, and just enjoyed the stories. I am delighted that the same is still true. I read this to my son over several nights, and while he did ask about the servants and \\"were they like slaves\\", this was more an additional facet, something he could enjoy and learn from, rather than something which inhibited his enjoyment. This story is of children who behave in much the same way as modern children would, leaving parental and adult supervision at the earliest opportunity, particularly if this involves getting into adventures and meeting magical creatures. The Psammead is an ancient Sand Fairy, and the children in the story are initially frightened of him, then grow to like him and respect his wisdom (even if he's a little cantankerous). The story follows the classic \\"what would you wish for if you had three wishes\\" formula, but is done with such style that each mini adventure that follows on is enjoyable, and a learning experience for the characters, rather than just being a list of examples of a smart-alec genie's deliberately obtuse interpretation of instructions.<br /><br />I would say this book is suitable for children of seven to fourteen, and doesn't really require any explanation of old-fashioned terms, but there can be much gained from discussing them.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|This new series rocks! Just saw the season finale on tv...Matt Smith is awesome as the doctor.  Can't wait to see what the next season of his run as the doctor holds in store for us who fans
B003V4SF0O|5.0|David Garrett blows me away, from his on-stage demeanor to his charming interviews, to his insane talent... he's the goods!      This cd is killer from top to bottom.  Not a track I don't like.    There's something so amazing about melding the rock songs I've loved for so long with classical instruments.  It just works.    He's endearing and wonderful and you must take six dollars and invest in your musical health!

B0013XW2F4|5.0|Since the publishing houses for the top mystery authors have seen fit to raise their Kindle edition prices as much as 50% in the past two months I started looking at some of the classics I've never read.  I was delighted to find the The Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection, the equal of over 1100 printed pages, for $3.60. A great bargain.

B003O9I85S|4.0|Hello 1985!  This takes me back to when I was a 14-year-old, record-buying, new wave-starved teenager, obsessed with Duran Duran and Depeche Mode.  a-ha's debut album fit nicely into that genre and it's been a life-long favorite.  Yes, their innovative videos and good looks captured everyone's attention, but this album had enough pop hooks and artistic merit to back it up.  (Even Coldplay's Chris Martin cites a-ha as a major influence.)  So, as excited as I am to have this remastered and expanded edition, I have a few small complaints to address:    1.  Where are the videos??  The groundbreaking, award-winning videos for the album's 4 singles should've been included here on a DVD.  Videos were such a huge part of a-ha's success, this collection feels incomplete without them.    2.  The hard-to-find 12\\" mix of \\"Take On Me\\" should've been included.    3.  Was this really remastered?  I can't hear any difference between this and the old CD version from 20 years ago.  It sounds good- just not any different.    4.  The 2nd disc of demos is interesting to hear, but much of it is just awkward and VERY dated.  It truly demonstrates how valuable an outside producer was to the band's early development.      Aside from that, Hunting High and Low is near and dear to my heart (even more so now that a-ha have announced their retirement).  I would recommend it to any synth-pop fan who missed it the first time around.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Wow, great book. Unfortunate the author has died. I would love to read more from him.

B002N8A14M|5.0|One of the best things about amazon.com is when you are looking for a product and aren't sure if it's going to be what you want, you can read all the fabulous reviews and find out the pros and cons of whatever you are looking for.  This was most definitely the case with this product.  I had been looking for a sport armband that 1) completely covered the screen to protect it when I am walking or running - and I didn't want some cheap film cover, I wanted a real plastic cover; 2) still had access to the controls; and 3) I wanted a stinking belt clip!  Apparently they are not that easy to come by - you either get the armband with no clip or if you are lucky, you can find a case with a keychain-type hook on it.  This sportband has everything I was looking for, and thanks to the detailed reviews, I knew I was going to get exactly what I wanted.  I like the option of the sport band, but if it looks like rain or I'm just walking, I unhook it from the band and use the belt clip.  If I'm running, it goes on the sport band and it's totally secure.  I really like that the belt clip is part of the case, so you either clip it to your belt/pants/whatever or you clip it onto the sportband, it doesn't have extra parts that can get lost.  I held off upgrading from my IPOD shuffle to the NANO until I found the right sportband/belt clip combo, was so happy I found this one.
0545123283|3.0|I absolutely LOVED 'Shiver', the first book in this collection. I loved the suspense, and I could feel the emotion. I was able to lose myself in the book. The ending was awesome! So perfectly written... Not a cliff hanger, leaving the reader frustrated they have to wait for a year to find out what happens next, no... It was a satisfying ending, exciting up until the very last line of the book, but left it open enough for a second book.<br />I felt like 'Linger' wasn't as well planned out. The chapters on Cole were repetitive and drug on and on. I felt it hopped back and forth between characters so much that you didn't get emotionally attached to any of them this book... It was extremely predictable.. I knew from the first few chapters how it would end. I expected more from this book. The ending was HORRIBLE! Talk about cliff hanger. It just made me frustrated and not really even caring to read the next book, if there is one. The first book had such an awesome happy ending, but Linger felt like one of those artsy films that purposefully ends badly to make a statement.<br /><br />If you haven't read Linger yet, either DON'T! Make up your own happy ending... Or wait until the next installment is published.
0783225482|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie but could not find a copy to rent or purchase. I was so very glad to find a brand new dvd for such a reasonable price.
0545123275|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book! It was well written, I fell in love with all the characters and was completely involved in the story. It was suspenseful right up to the very end with an awesome ending that won't disappoint.<br /><br />I can't say the same though for it's sequel. If you plan to read the second one, wait until the next installment is published.

B002ZG981E|5.0|one of those movies that you'll leave the theatre and think about for a long ass time. THis movie went beyond my expectation and i already knew it would be amazing being directed by chris nolan. i can not give it enough praise. LEO was absolutely stunning in his acting and the others were mind blowing. the plot basically mind raped and reinforced me to watch it again. i'm so glad i did because it helped me understand it better. LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. TRUELY A WORK OF ART

B001NEK2GE|4.0|This is a great gaming pad for the PC. This product is comfortable to use and the software is easy to use. It works with any PC game out there and you can create custom profiles to your hearts content along with simple macros. The only issue I have with this gaming pad is that the official game pad profiles supported are lack luster and outdated. Logitech does not support adding new profiles for newer released games it seems. So the profiles it does support are for games which were already out when this thing released. If Logitech would actually create and update their profile list for newer games  this would be the best game pad ever. As it stands now my old and broken Ideazon Fang had better support for newer games as Ideazon would constantly pump out profiles for their Fang game pad. Of course don't get me wrong the G13 is the superior product when it comes to software, comfort, over all construction and sturdiness, etc but Ideazon has one plus in that they actually update their product profiles for newer games.
0307454541|1.0|I had just come off a good string of books that I completely enjoyed and wanted to keep the trend going. So, I picked up \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\". I figure with all the hype around it and being a huge international bestseller this was a sure thing. BOY, WAS I WRONG! I usually judge a book by page 100. If I am in to it by then, I keep going. I hit page 100 and wanted to put it down. But, friends encouraged me to stick with it. Went another 50 pages and I was still nodding off. It is page after page of over indulgent groundwork. The writing style is pedestrian at best. Nothing clever or witty. Just run, don't walk away from this book!!!

B003J27WFW|5.0|Rush never got much respect from the press, the critics. They were, in their own words, outside of the mainstream but very nearby in their own stream.\\" Yet, it turns out, they were always the outsiders. Bullies loved to wait for them, to attack them, physically, emotionally. Whatever. Many of us have seen that kind of abuse. We can rise above. The guys in Rush did, and here they are with a fantastic new documentary covering their history and career. It makes me wonder what those bullies are thinking now. Do they even realize that the long haired \\"hippies\\" they were taunting are the same guys that are probably rocking out to? Life is interesting with its twists and turns.    I love this movie. Sure, they could have covered a lot more, and I wish a Rush show could last another three hours on top of the three they give us, but we are all human, still.  We all only have so much to give, and they have given so much. I'l take what I can get and hope for more, but I will never expect more. Life is funny. It takes expectations and runs them through the meat grinder over and over again.     Again, this film made me appreciate that aspect of life all over again.  I am glad that this movie seems to be putting the expectations of some non fans through said meat grinder. They appreciate the people behind the music which, retroactively, sends them back to the music. Maybe they hear something they never heard before. Maybe their thoughts don't change. but they give it a chance. Maybe their minds are opened to new ideas and new possibilities. Maybe not. How else is change affected if you don't try some new input to think about? If you don't like it, you don't like it.  Life still goes on, whichever way the wind blows for captains, philosophers and working men and women.    I always felt like one of those outsiders:  always a bit awkward in crowds and at parties. I still do, though I've come out of my shell a bit, and I've faced off with a bully or two, successfully.  All told though, I think I kind of  like my shell. And strangely, Rush, of all things, showed me that I can be engaged and concerned with the world around me, and still be OK with my shell and need for space and privacy.     Check it out for yourself. You might be amazed.
B002ZHKZEM|3.0|Although, I've seen the specials when they were broadcast, I haven't experienced this dvd set; however, no one seems to have mentioned that this is not a complete set of the movies. So, what happened to 'Voyage of the Damned'?
076790592X|1.0|This book had been assigned a few times during my college years, only two years out from release.  I was puzzled as to why teachers assigned the book.  It was simplistic, and it had a view that I assumed most people grew out of during high school.  Most of us reach a certain philosophical approach to life, and think that we're having a collection of deep thoughts during high school, and at a certain point we realize that these are things that everyone is aware of.  We aren't plumbing new depths of thought.  But apparently, this isn't true.  Some people grow out of this approach a bit later - during college.  Some people never grow out of it.  And it seems that most people never grow out of it.  This explains the popularity of this book.  It is written for a very young audience.  I have no problem with that.  But there is nothing even vaguely complex with the book.  The ideas are simplistic and approached with the nuance of a baseball bat.    I'm far enough removed from this work that I don't have as much contempt for it as I used to.  But in all seriousness, there are more complex issues at work in Spider-Man comics.

B000UH8BTK|5.0|While I understand the collectors beef about the difference between this edition and the Japanese pressings and packaging, they're missing the point - as far a I'm concerned this was the best value for money I've found in a long time. though I was aware of Weather Report by reputation - somehow I had skipped class somewhere in my ongoing musical education dating from the listening to Django records and of course growing up with the Beatles. So when the opportunity presented itself to immerse myself in some jazz fusion greatness for just a shade over $2 per CD, I leapt at the chance.<br />A few days in and I'm hooked and loving going back to school. I listened to the CD's in order and revelled in the progression from freeform improv to more groove  funk-based tracks. For those who moan the lack of track info , check out [...] for an incredible Weather Report annotated discography.<br />The more you listen to this music the more you will become disheartened by the lack of musicianship and creativity in most of what passes for 'music' today.<br />SO treat yourself to one of the best deals on the planet and educate yourself!!
B003KT3NRA|4.0|Ever since `Motley Crue' made that triumphant studio comeback with `Saints of Los Angeles' two years ago, I've been looking forward to any musical release coming form the `...Crue' camp; So this 2010 album `Tatoos & tequila' is the third overall studio release from Vince as a solo artist with an evident and very fitting summer atmosphere.<br /><br />With the exception of two songs, `Tattoos...' is a covers album; even before playing the CD, I was very excited by the fact that Neil recruited bassist Dana Strum and guitarist Jeff Blando (both ex-`Slaughter') as well as drum prodigy Zoltan Claney. The band, as expected, is hot rocking and together with Vince they `motley-ize' a good amount of classic rock tracks. Vince has got to receive credit for planning this carefully: finding top old school musicians, and choosing the most fitting songs to his voice and overall glam/sleaze style. Most importantly, however, Vince and the guys manage to deliver a rocking summer album full of positive attitude which I suppose is exactly what times demand. Favorite tracks include `Tattoos and Tequila', `Nobody's fault', `Viva Las Vegas' and `Another piece of meat'.<br /><br />A spot on release form Vince, the right band, the right songs, the right attitude offering the ideal summer-rocker album for just about any fan of the genre. (I very much hope that we see an all-original studio album by this amazing line-up sometime soon).<br /><br />The European version of the album issued by `Frontiers records' includes a 12th bonus track, `Beer drinkers and hell raisers'<br /><br />`Metal Hammer' Greek magazine (issue 307) marks this album with 7/10 commenting: \\"...a pure `sleaze' journey...\\"
B000068OCS|5.0|AHMAZING, this film really makes you think about life, and how we live it. I went into watching this film without knowing anything about it includind the no words thing. But the music really makes up for it, and the breathtaking scenes last a lifetime. At first the opening scenes were a little hard for me to watch, especially since I thought it would break out into a scene like traditional moveis. But as I soon realized... it didn't matter. There are not enough great things or words I could say to describe this. All you have to do is leave behind your barriers and open the seal of consiousness, and you soon too will realize, we are only what nature allow us to be. See for youself the sped up and slomo scenes, better than any special effect I have ever seen, because it is real life.
0061914177|5.0|This is a great book.  Gary explains in detail how to use SEM - search engine marketing and social networking sites to generate business regardless of the industry.  He will teach the reader how to create a buzz.  His advice is very specific.<br /><br />His stories are both interesting and demonstrative.  Gary has a passion for wine and the Jets (the Jets?).  He puts his heart and sole into this book. If you only read two books this entire year, read Crush It and What Would Google Do.  I would read Gary's book first and then WWGD.

030726999X|3.0|The book opens to lisbeth salander is brought to the er , nearly dead. Blomkvist is arrested and some crazy old man walked into the hospital and shot zalachencko for no apparent reason. What oh what is going on? This is a pretty good story, but the first 130 or so pages seemed like a bad episode of law and order.( That is saying something) The first several chapters drag us down dead end streets with characters( with names that all sound alike) that we only hear of once for no appparant reason. Example - telling the complete life story about a cleaning guy that bugs a hospital room . Oh and the talk about the section and swedish government is so confusing and unless you are like a swedish diplomat or know your government none of this will make much sense to you.<br />Luckilly this book does get better in the middle. It also delves more in to Erica berger, Blomkvist's friend with benefits. I never cared for the woman until this book, she rubbed me the wrong way. Hornet's nest makes her human and someone you can care about.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I got this as a gift for Father's Day, and I've been overall very pleased with it.    Pros:  - Ear cups don't rest on the ears themselves at all  - Wire is nice and heavy without being overly stiff  - Microphone works perfectly  - Shirt clip on wire keeps it from moving around whenever I turn my head    Cons:  - Fabric used to cover the padding on the ear cups takes some breaking in  - Headset is overall fairly heavy  - On-wire remote is a bit huge
B003O86MY8|3.0|It pains me to write a less-than-enthusiastic review for this album, as I am a fan of David Garrett, but I must be honest. I thought his first U.S. album, titled \\"David Garrett\\" was great. This album, though, is not that good.<br /><br />I thought his rendition of Vivaldi's \\"Summer\\" on his first U.S. album was fantastic, and I was expecting his renditions of Beethoven's 5th symphony and Vivaldi's \\"Winter\\" on this one to be just as good. Much to my dismay, I found that they were not so well done. The beginning and end of each of those songs are quite good and the songs could have been magnificent overall had he not taken excessive artistic license with them. The middle of \\"The 5th\\" slumps into a chaotic, disco-like mess, and \\"Vivaldi vs. Vertigo\\" is overly repetitive. His violin-playing is out of sync with the orchestra in \\"The 5th\\" - I can't understand why they let that slide.<br /><br />I had heard him play \\"Kashmir\\" twice in concert with his band, and it was very moving. This rendition, however, was weak and disappointing. Much the same for most of the other pieces.<br /><br />I do give him credit for \\"Toccata\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\", which were well done. But that's not much compared to his prior, much better album.

Young people today need to be aware that this very thing is happening in the world today.  We are destroying our world and some peoples way of living all for the almighty dollar.   Tribes of people are being pushed out of their villages and/or killed, trees and plants destroyed.    We really enjoyed this movie and we think everyone else will to.
B001HN69B8|4.0|Terry Gilliam has a history of production problems in his movies, and the death of Heath Ledger during the filming of \\"Imaginarium\\" seemed to those outside to be too big to overcome. A brilliant turn of the script, however, turned what could have been the downfall of the movie into an interesting plot device.    This movie is not for everyone, and those coming into this film expecting the more \\"main-stream\\" version of Terry Gilliam, a la \\"12 Monkeys,\\" will be disappointed. This film harkens back to the fantastical worlds created by the film maker in his movie classics \\"Brazil,\\" \\"The Adventures of Baron von Munchausen,\\" and \\"Time Bandits.\\" Those of us that enjoy that side of Terry Gilliam will come away pleased with the results.
B000HC2LI0|1.0|I enjoyed the orginal show, the action never lagged, writing always quick-witted.  HOWEVER, the recording of these discs (just about every one of them) is of extremely poor quality.  These could only have been rejects that should have been destroyed.  The poor quality is such a distraction that it severely compromises what should have been many hours of veiwing pleasure.  Had I known the discs were so poorly recorded, I would never have ordered them. Such a disappointment!

B000WGWQG8|5.0|A great show and the DVD has several interesting and educational features the airing on HBO didn't, including a brief appearance by David McCollough, the author of the book. The soundtrack of this show is excellent. I bought the CD separately and it has a terrific amount of music that represents America of that era and several European pieces those familiar with Stanley Kubrick's \\"Barry Lyndon\\" will have heard. (The soundtrack for that film is long out of print and available only at premium prices.)
B00000AFFF|5.0|Couldn't stop listening to it for weeks after it came in the mail. Quickly rose to one of the favorite CD's I own. Simply delightful work of art, and the Grammy awarded for \\"I Still Have That Other Girl\\" was very well deserved. Really, anything Costello does just amazes me, and Bacharach is an excellent musician and songwriter; you couldn't ask for a more seamless and iconic collaboration.
0385342020|5.0|I had my doubts about this book--it seemed so different from the other Kinsella books I've read--but I loved every bit of it. Once I settled into the story, my only worry was how the author could bring it all to a happy and satisfactory ending. There's an undertone of melancholy to the story, of course, but overall it's terrific fun. I loved Sadie and her screaming, conniving ways. And although there were times when I cringed for Lara, the heroine, as she headed toward one of those trademark Kinsella disaster moments, I wouldn't change a thing about this funny, heartwarming story.  Well done.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|This Album is absolutley amazing. It shows a different side of her. She's very creative when it comes to music. I honsetly can't choose a favorite song off this CD.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This is one of the best CD/DVD's I think I have ever purchased...I can't stop listening to the CD in the car...the music is wonderful and brings back all these memories of my childhood...Carole King and James Taylor are iconic and their talent transends the generations....I would HIGHLY urge anyone reading this to purchase this CD/DVD set...you will not be disapointed and I found out that it is much cheaper on Amazon.com then any other place I looked.

B001UV4XUG|4.0|A fantastic, feel good movie. Finally a movie that actually shows the real young-adult perspective. I would recomend this love story (oh yea,\\"this is not a love story.\\" to absolutely anyone old enough to watch. AMAZING SOUNDTRACK!
B0036S4CTS|4.0|Having never lived in England and not being familiar with the area, I had a hard time with the local and slang references. Once I decided to not worry about it anymore the book flowed better for me. This is such a great story concept and the author handled it perfectly. There were a few places I sort of skimmed over because they seemed to drag on forever without really advancing the story any. I must admit I was very invested in Em and Dex by the end and enjoyed the read. One thing - be sure to pay attention to the date at the beginning of each chapter as it doesn't always run chronologically.
B003HKN52A|2.0|Warner Bros has screwed Elvis fans again.  It has sort of become a tradition by this point.<br /><br />In this newly released DVD/Blu-Ray release of \\"Elvis On Tour\\", Warner Bros has removed \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" from the opening credits and replaced it with a pathetically edited live version of \\"Don't Be Cruel.\\"  Anyone who has seen the original opening credits knows that this decision was a huge misstep.  Not only did the opening credits set the tone for the entire film---it was obviously chosen to be the song to accompany the stunning opening footage.  It was an artistic choice made by the editors to marry these 2 elements together.  Now, in this first-ever-release of \\"Elvis on Tour\\"---WB has decided to remove \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" and replace it with a below-par version of \\"Don't Be Cruel.\\"  To make matters worse--the \\"editing\\" job to loop the track to fit the 2 minute credits is deplorable.  I would not be surprised if the loop was created by a 14 year old kid who just discovered ProTools.  It's an absolutely amateur hack job that leaves you speechless.  Their new Frankenstein opening insults the original credits and most of all it insults the fans.<br /><br />There is absolutely no mention of this change anywhere.  Not in the description, nor in the press release announcing this project.  It was an underhanded move.  This only shows how little WB cares about their Elvis products or his fans--a group whose patience has been tested time and time again.  See these other instances:<br /><br />That's The Way It Is Special Edition 2001 - instead of including a batch of bonus songs and special features---all plans were scrapped at the 11th hour.  This film had reels and reels of extra footage that was waiting to be seen and WB took that away from the fans.<br /><br />That's The Way It Is (2007) Now they've re-released the film with both the ORIGINAL film and the re-edited film from 2001 on DVD.  This time they included a collection of bonus songs---but in the poorest qualityimaginable.  Footage that looked like came from 5th generation VHS tapes with a mono soundtrack.  Just awful.<br /><br />And of course on top of all this-we had to wait nearly 15 years for Elvis On Tour to get its own DVD release.  Much like the film \\"That's The Way It Is\\", it is very well documented (and bootlegged) that there are hours upon hours of additional footage available from \\"Elvis On Tour.\\"  There are countless hours of concert footage, candid behind the scenes footage, reels of rehearsal footage and even a rare on camera interview with Elvis himself.  There is enough extra material that could have easily fit 3 additional discs, thereby creating a magnificent multi-DVD box set that would no doubt put Elvis in an extremely flattering light.<br /><br />But we didn't get any of that---instead we get a bare-bones release with not a drop of special features.  But hey, we had won the war.  We were just happy to get the damn movie on DVD---finally!  It was a small victory amongst the fans.  We turned the other cheek on the lack of bonus footage--we just wanted the original film.  But we don't even get that.  They butcher the opening credits completely spoiling the film right from the beginning.<br />So what are fans to do?  We are screwed time and time again only so WB can milk more and more money out of us.  No doubt WB will re-release Elvis On Tour properly some years down the line.  But the fact that they could not even preserve the original film for us in its first ever DVD release is pathetic.<br /><br />I have no idea what WB's plans are with the mounds of Elvis footage they have in their possession. The majority of Elvis fans who would actually pay to see this footage are not getting younger. Some of Elvis' best live footage is locked away with no real hope of ever being seen by anyone.  That is truly a shame.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  I liked that it was set different places across the United States.  Adults and children will love it. Read the whole series!!!
B001OQCV2E|2.0|Watching a film like 2012 one MUST throw  all logic and credibility out the window. They MUST remove their brains to allow the ridiculous story to be processed only as an adrenaline rushing barrage of GCI FX and intense yet idiotic circumstances.<br /><br />My title refers to the film 'Armageddon' because I happen to love that film, even though it is just as preposterous. The difference between the two films is that Armageddon doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a testosterone filled patriotic joy ride into space.<br /><br />'2012' has too many moments where I felt the actors were actually trying to make this story seem believable, but in their action made the film even more unbelievable. One instance of this is when the main characters are aboard a plane trying to reach the arks and the family decides to take a nap??! There are lots of moments like this, but that isn't what keeps this film from reaching the greatness of Armageddon as one of the greatest stupid films of all time(OK in part it is that). The film suffers from being way too long and there isn't a really likabler character to root for! It has too many climaxes and the end is too sappy even for this sort of thing.<br /><br />I still recommend this film for action junkies as it does have some intense moments and decent FX, but it just isn't as good as it could be.

B002VPE1OS|4.0|I was excited about getting this product for my wife to use on her newly-inherited 3GS (after I upgraded to the new iPhone 4).  She's been excited about using this since her eyesight is not the best in the world.  In direct light, this product certainly does the trick and deflects the light away.  A surprising benefit has been the lack of any fingerprints on the screen which tends to be a problem when you don't use a protector film at all.  The only downside she says the sensitivity of the screen is reduced on some applications on the phone.  The film could be thinner to reduce this problem.  Of course, then the glare control may dissipate.  All in all, a good screen protector for the iPhone 3G.
B000FKO0Q0|1.0|The DVD is so old that it is not viewable on new equipment. It was never seen. A waste of time to return, but a lesson well-learned.   I love this movie with these particular characters and feel that it should have been stated that it is for use with old style equipment only.
0316926345|5.0|\\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is a novel that can be read on so many levels. It is peopled with real characters that leap of the page in all of their complexity, it is a fervent convert's exuberant praise to his recently realized God, it is a glimpse of the fading aristocracy of England, and it is a story of a few people and their journey to find their faith and proper place in the world.<br />This book is vastly different from Waugh's satirical earlier works. There is still satire and humor in this text, but it is dryer and less central to the plot than in some of his previous novels. Also, unlike his previous efforts the characters in this novel are not caricature, but well developed human individuals. It is also rather episodic in plot and we follow the characters from their late teens to early thirties, a rather formative time in one's life.<br /> I think that reading this novel will be a fuller experience if the reader has a religious background, and some personal experience with faith. But it is not necessary to enjoying (and getting something) from the text.<br />The novel deals with a close circle of friends, and depicts how they all in their own ways come to God. I feel that Mr. Waugh was trying to write a great novel of faith (my personal opinion) and to that extent I think he left religion, and the Catholic Church in particular, open to some criticism, which I don't think was his intent. However, one could read the same sections that I think expose the weakness of the church, and see them as plot details that strengthen the argument for faith. Waugh was much smarter than I, and I am going to assume that was his goal. What makes the text so layered is that one can read the novel and see a great testament to God and Church, and others can read it and just as easily argue for the destructive power of religion on individuals.  To me, that is one of the greatest assets of \\"Brideshead Revisited\\".<br />This novel got under my skin, in a good way, and has been knocking around in my head since I finished. To me, that is high praise. I will be revisiting this text again. Probably again, and again...<br />Read it with a group of friends, there will be lots to digest, and the vastness of reactions this novel will be sure to engender will make the process all the more enjoyable and richer.ad since I finished.

0307271862|3.0|As an avid Mankell reader I was a bit disappointed about this one. The story starts out interestingly enough but then turns into one endless long defense speech for the \\"Old China's\\" (and the Western hippies') values and ideals. You'd wish there was more at this time. Also, the story lines digress way too much and in the end, the solution is a bit predictable.    Having said this, Mankell is still far superior than other mystery writers.

6305907145|1.0|This movie is an abomination. Jane Austin would have been ashamed to watch some of it's scenes.  The director took so many liberties with this movie its ridiculous.  She purposefully changed the main character \\"Fanny\\" from a sweet, wise, innocent, and honest girl, to a feminist with an anti-slavery agenda which was not in the book at all!  Miss Crawford is presented as bi-sexual and Mr. Crawford is actually presented in a likable manner when you are supposed to know he is a flirt and a scumbag!  All the majesty of a beautiful, wealthy house is some how missing and all the characters are inaccurate in some way from the way Jane Austin wrote them.     Do not buy this movie. EVER.

B002VPE1YS|5.0|Five PADDED Stars!! Another affordable item from the AmazonBasics group of accessory items for electronics. Practically sized to fit small items such as iPods, Cell Phones, and Digital cameras, it consists of double-sided black polyester foam-filled material which is divided into multiple squares formed into a pouch shape, fitted with a drawstring and bead closure at one end  and a handy carabiner. The padding will provide some protection for the item and has a one year warranty. Highly Recommended.

0765350386|4.0|I was led to Sanderson after seeing his name popping up in several forums and in reviews of other books that I had enjoyed here on Amazon.  It made sense, to me, to start with his first work and thus I picked up \\"Elantris\\" with pretty high expectations.  However, having read Elantris (which was not a bad read) and now Mistborn, I'd highly recommend starting with the latter.    While I was impressed with \\"Elantris,\\" it being a debut novel and such, \\"Mistborn\\" so greatly exceeded the expectations set by that novel that it was almost hard for me to believe they were written by the same author.  The world was both believable and vividly realized and the plot, with it's hat-tip to classic \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" heist stylings, was unique in my experience of the fantasy genre.  As has been mentioned many times and in many places, the magic system portrayed in the story is not only logical and cohesive, but entirely original -- not to mention ingenious.    I felt that the primary characters were well-developed and distinct, contrary to some other reviews I've read on the book, and as a guy who prefers novels driven by character, it was this aspect that had perhaps the strongest influence on my opinion of the book.  In particular, I enjoyed the contrasting elements that gave depth to personality.  It just seems to make things more interesting when one of your key protagonists is a caring and compassionate leader with a touch of cold-blooded murderer thrown in.    As a bonus, the author has provided annotations to each chapter on his website, allowing the reader to follow along with the development and thought processes that went into the creation of this impressive novel -- a bit of a treat for those of us who enjoy writing as much as we do reading.    All in all, a VERY strong sophomore effort that reveals growth and development in the author and promises very good things to come.  Read \\"Elantris\\" first and you may or may not pick up another Sanderson novel.  Read \\"Mistborn\\" first and I promise you you'll be hungry for more.

0671042858|4.0|This is a great book that differs a bit from King's usual horror-fiction.  Events<br />are told from a single character perspective and we are left at the end wondering whether they actually occurred or were a figment of a young girl's imagination.  The book is fast-paced and short making for a quick read.  It should appeal to younger readers and those who like a suspenseful story with horror elements without a lot of 'blood and guts' killing.
B0000640VO|5.0|Am&eacute;lie has never quite adjusted to people.  She lives alone and seems to like it that way, until she finds a tin box in her apartment, left behind by a resident who had been a resident as a child there decades earlier.  She realizes that if she can return it to the grown him it could be a good thing.  Which leads to her the idea that helping others in general would give her the same feeling, without them knowing she is helping of course, and so it becomes her prime focus in life.  Well that and teasing and tempting a man she takes a liking to - also from afar.<br /><br />It's a fun quirky movie.  Everyone should be so lucky as to bump into their own Am&eacute;lie in life.

B003UMMSSW|3.0|After seeing The Police and Sting many times in concert and listening to both album and live performances of his wonderful work for many, many years, I am a little critical.  My major gripe with this recording is the title, which is obviously taken from his tour with the same name.  Only problem, there is not one single song on this recording from the actual Synchronicity album of 1983.  After seeing the Symphonicities setlist, this is obviously not a greatest hits from the tour but a mixed bag of great songs and rare tracks that were performed.  A few seem very out of place on this shortened concert, mainly \\"Next To You\\", and others compliment each other nicely, like \\"Burn for You\\" followed by \\"We Work the Black Seam\\".  A full recorded show from the Symphonicities tour needs to be released.  This presentation is overall decent, the complete show would have been much better.  There are some greats that should have been here, maybe something off of Synchronicity since it's called Symphonicities.

B0036EH3WK|2.0|Forget it! The only way this show worked was by stringing it out over such a long period of time that you forget almost 75% of the things you hear over the seasons.     This show had so much magic, character development, mystery, and epic battles that it was such a shame to end it the way it did.     If you watch this show from beginning to end you will feel very let down by the ending. Not to say it isn't a good ending, but it's an ending of a SEASON not of a SERIES. This show left absolutely way too much unanswered.     In the middle of Season 6 I ordered this set. After the show ended, I canceled my order. Why rewatch the entire show only to know it ends without answering all the things you wanted to know about?

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this after I bought the sharpening stone kit by Smiths.  I bought this one because I needed the serrated edge sharpen stone and find I don't even use the double stone kit anymore.  This sharpener didn't work at all when I first bought it. Because it has a lanyard and so easy to use - I kept using it. I found after about forty minutes of breaking it in - - AWESOME.  It sharpens surgical sharp just be very careful because it is a bit hard to use at the end of the stroke.  It is well worth the money!  It fits right into my survival kit!  It is super effective and very affordable....<br /><br />-CSL

1591843162|5.0|Linchpin by Seth Godin     \\"Self marketing might be the most important kind. What story do you tell yourself about yourself?\\" Seth Godin    Anne McCrossan, a in her review of Linchpin on Grodin's site Squidoo [...], said that Seth had commented that our depressed economy may someday be seen as an under appreciated chapter in history in the same way that until recently historians thought the Dark Ages were just dark and not a preparation for the Renaissance that was to follow.    Anne also noted that digital transparency is making personal reputation more important than corporate reputation. In addition technical self-sufficiency; computers and other technology can be powerful tools when combined with our ability to overcome fear and access our inherent creativity. Workers whether solo or corporate can seize the power and stand out from the crowd of individuals looking for certainty in these challenging times.     How to cultivate these qualities? Seth Godin employs neuroscience, social marketing, eastern philosophy, psychology and social theory to empower and support the artist (in the broadest sense of the term) in all of us.  But first we need to be clear on exactly what we are working with.    The chapter called The Resistance, starting on page 101 details that, it was powerful for me.  The Resistance, recounts a story about a woman with severe short-term memory loss starring the Amygdala.       Quote from Linchpin--   \\"Each day she would visit her doctor. He would shake her hand, reintroduce himself, and they would start over. One day, in a fairly unethical experiment, he put a thumbtack in his hand. When they shook hands she was pinched. It hurt. He explained to her what he had done, and of course, an hour later she had forgotten about it.    The next day, though when the doctor extended his hand, she flinched. How did she know about the thumbtack? Her short term memory was clearly gone. She wasn't faking. And yet, she remembered enough to avoid the pain.    This was her amygdala at work. It has it's own memory, it's own survival system in place. The lizard brain stands by, jumping into action whenever basic survival needs are at stake. And when it is aroused, the other part of our brains stand little chance, particularly if we haven't trained for these events.    And so, the conflict. The conflict between what feels good now and what we ought to do. This explains how someone with throat cancer can persist in smoking, or how an obese person who clearly knows better can persist in eating \\"just one more doughnut.\\" In the face of greed or fear from the amygdala, an untrained person surrenders\\".    Fear comes up for all of us often at the expense of logic, talent and potential. Seth Godin goes to great lengths in Linchpin to help us zero in on how these phenomena are at work in our lives and what we can do to make a dent in the situation.      Attributes of the lizard brain listed in the book:     \\"The Lizard Brain on top of your spine fighting for survival...  \\"Wants to eat and be safe...  \\"Will fight to the death if it has to...  \\"Would rather run away...  \\"Likes a vendetta...  \\"Has no trouble getting angry...  \\"Cares what everyone thinks...  \\"Believes that status in the tribe is essential to survival...    Shenpa*   Here is the definition of the term Shenpa, used by Godin to describe phenomena produced by the Amygdala.    *A t term discussed in \\"Don't Bite the Hook: Finding Freedom from Anger, Resentment, and Other Destructive Emotions, by Pema Chodron  [...]    Here is an everyday example of shenpa. Somebody says a mean word to you and then something in you tightens-- that's the shenpa. Then it starts to spiral into low self-esteem, or blaming them, or anger at them, denigrating yourself. And maybe if you have strong addictions, you just go right for your addiction to cover over the bad feeling that arose when that person said that mean word to you. This is a mean word that gets you, hooks you. Another mean word may not affect you but we're talking about where it touches that sore place-- that's a shenpa. Someone criticizes you--they criticize your work, they criticize your appearance, they criticize your child-- and, shenpa: almost co-arising.      Having our ego bruised is familiar to us all. Why do we go over and over it and over it? The amygdyla, our fight or flight mechanism has been triggered.     Some quotes from Linchpin that I find helpful    \\"Nip it in the bud. If you cant teach the world a lesson, accept it. Don't get attached to a different outcome, sit with the anxiety\\".    \\"If you boss has some critical comments for you say `Thanks for the feedback', and repeat the feedback to him in your own words. It only takes 3 seconds and you avoided an hour of pain\\".    \\"The quiet strength it takes to withstand the urge to flee builds confidence in those around you\\".    Seth Godin sat in a meeting with the itch and the squirming for two days. \\"The \\"resistance\\" (another name for the lizard brain) realized he wasn't going to change his position\\".    \\"Never let the lizard send an email\\".     \\"Accept that human beings are difficult to change. Embrace the uniqueness that everyone brings to the table\\".    \\"Perhaps it's not your job to change what can't be changed\\".     \\"Particularly if working on that change harms you and your goals in the process\\".    \\"Attachment to outcome blinds one to the available choices\\".    \\"What's scarce is a desire to accept what is and then work to change it for the better, not deny that it exists\\".     \\"Art, generosity and brave action are in demand.\\"    \\"Do your art only for people you like, people you enjoy.\\"    \\"A gift is a signal of surplus.\\"    \\"Giving a gift with no expectation of reciprocal implies abundance. The power lies in the creation of abundance.\\"    \\"Generous artists aren't easily replaceable\\".    Regards, Jennifer

No time to write more, I watching the whole thing through again....................

B0002XMF5I|4.0|Ian Gillian fronting Black Sabbath? It sounded strange, but the combination worked! All of the songs on this record are strong. Ian Gillian's voice pairs remarkably well with Tony Iommi's brooding guitar sound. It was the album that Deep Purple fans wish Deep Purple could have made...and Sabbath fans were happy that yet another powerhouse vocalist was within thier ranks again. it was an inspirational album for some....just listen to the the riff from ZERO THE HERO......I don't know about you, but it seems the boys in Guns-N-Roses kinda borrowed that riff and used it in PARADISE CITY(listen to those songs back to back and you'll see what I mean).<br /><br /> Overall....this album is not PARANOID, it's not HEAVEN & HELL, but it is one of the stronger and better albums in the Sabbath catalog(just listen to NEVER SAY DIE, TECHNICAL ECSTASY or any of the very late 80's & early 90's Sabbath releases). It can always be found at a resonable price now, so there is no reason that anyone who is into Sabbath, Purple or any other good classic metal/rock band shouldn't enjoy this.<br /><br />happy Listening! \m/
B003CM368Q|1.0|I live in the Philippines and ordered this product online and had it sent to a friend in the U.S. It was then shipped via sea but experienced many delays because of some uncontrollable factors. I finally got the unit July 6. Was very disappointed to find that it did not work properly with my isuzu pickup - the sound produced versus the actual engine revs were way off. I figured it didn't match with the vehicle due to new electronics or some other reason. I gave it to my cousin to try on some other vehicles and he had the same results. Now it's just a glorified fm transmitter for an mp3 player. Maybe i just got a lemon but since the shipping took so long and would cost too much to ship back, there is nothing i can do about it. That's the risk i took...
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Although this is really a children's book, it appeals to all ages and goes into detail about ancient Egyptian's mystical and religious beliefs, which I find fascinating.  The plot's very fast paced action and will keep you glued to it. It's filled with very graphic visual imaginary of monsters and Egyptian Gods, but never holding back on the story line.  I highly recommend it.

B003L45JLW|5.0|I love this album.  I think it is one of their best.  I bought the BluRay just so I could get the FLAC 24/48 download.  These files are not as compressed as the CD and they sound fantastic.  I will probably never use the BluRay.  In the future, I wish they would sell just the hi res FLAC 24/48 files, or even offer 24/96.
044656740X|1.0|This book does have very valid points -<br /><br />1.  Invest in cash flow producing assets that will pay you, your kids, and your kids kids forever,<br />2.  Be savvy,<br />3.  \\"Think outside the box\\" (I hate that term).<br /><br />But it's ridden with made-up examples of how Robert \\"flips\\" apartment complexes for hundreds of thousands of dollars of profits, which clearly never occurred, but are inserted to make him out to be an \\"expert\\".<br /><br />He also claims he bought penny stocks that gained thousands of percentage points and made him a millionaire - from one investment in penny stocks!  If you've ever invested in penny stocks, maybe, MAYBE 1 out of every 200 stocks actually amount to something, but most are junk and a very, VERY poor invesment recommendation.  But of course, he did it!<br /><br />The \\"Rich Dad\\" and the \\"Poor Dad\\" are also fictional characters.<br /><br />Clearly, he needed to convey his points of the \\"Rich\\" vs. the \\"Poor\\" by creating these characters, which is fine and I get it, just know that 80% of this book is fluff with made up investment returns, but the other 20% is really good stuff.<br /><br />It's a one star book based on poor writing and a lot of wasteful reading to convey a few valid points that could have been conveyed in a 30 page book.  Weak.
1591843162|5.0|Seth Godin's book 'Linchpin', is a great addition to any hardworking person's book collection.<br /><br />As a programmer for a small company, who is very interested in entrepreneurial and startup related information, I was able to extract a lot of great information from Seth's writings.<br /><br />In summary, his book teaches you how to be more successful--at everything. Seth explains how today's world demands more dynamic workers, people who are able to think critically, and use their creativity and passion to make their work truly priceless.<br /><br />So often, we are taught by schools, society, and even our families, that we must simply 'fit in', and go with the flow. We are trained to follow orders, stifle our inner passions, and just 'work' in a factory. Seth's book challenges this philosophy, and suggest rapid paradigm shifts to re-structure yourself, your thinking, and your habits.<br /><br />I'm giving Linchpin 5 stars because it is well written, contains extremely valuable information, and is really enjoyable to read.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in bettering yourself, and becoming an invaluable asset to your company, then this book should be on your shelf.
0316017922|5.0|For the most part, after reading a book I simply can't stand it...most books could realistically be a 2 page magazine article, but this book was packed with info, examples, and research.      I'm not a huge reader, but trust, I will be reading all of Malcolm's books going forward...I'm hooked.    Outliers does a great job of analyzing success, both the downside and upside measure of success, specifically all the small nuances that make successful people successful, and unsuccessful people unsuccessful.  It's really quite amazing how Malcolm breaks these 2 groups of people down.    Buy the book - it's worth every penny!
0375758992|4.0|This was a story that was hard to read because of the hardship of the child growing up.  It was a great insight to what it would be like to grow-up in the African wilds.  One would have to put aside all judgements of what should be and accept that this is the truth of what this child lived in her day.   I like true stories and this is one I am glad I read and feel that I can have a deeper insight into the lives of people in a third world country.    I have also lived in a third world country so know that much of this story is real.  I am glad I read it.
1582701709|1.0|Ok fine I get it.      We need to think positively to adequately live our lives, but that's like 1 step in a 10 step process to really getting what you want.    The best advise I ever got was \\"Life is what you make of it\\", and it's true, life requires a lot of effort.  But to only advise people to \\"think and it will appear\\", is preposterous.    The only path to pure happiness is through action - getting everything God blessed you with out of your system and into the world.  That's a paraphrased Russell Simons quote.    Happiness is not crossing your fingers and really, really, REALLY hoping for the best...that's just empty hope.    This chick also 100% stole this book from a book written in the 1800's by Wallace D. Wattles titled \\"The Science of Getting Rich\\".  That book is available for free online...not sure where but it's out there.    Lame book...don't waste your money.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|I guess I'm in the minority, but I am pretty disappointed with this headset (the newer PX21 model).     First, they are not made for smaller heads and fit me quite poorly, and no, I'm not a pin-head; my head is fully proportional. To help with this issue, I have started taking a washcloth and wrapping it around the top head rest. While this does make a difference, it's ridiculous that I have to do this, not to mention, it looks completely absurd.    Second, and maybe this is just because they are still new and need to be broken in more, but they start really hurting my ears a lot quicker than I'm used to with other headphones.    Finally, I'm not so impressed with the sound. As has already been mentioned, there is a constant hiss which is quite annoying. Beyond that, the overall sound is only so-so. While I can hear noises rather well, I have a difficult time determining it directionally. Considering that I primarily got these to play MW2 while my wife is asleep, it's pretty annoying. I have a mediocre 5.1 setup, and while it may be unfair to compare these to an actual system, I find these severely lacking comparatively.    Like I said, maybe I'm the exception but that's my two cents.
B003NFM3JU|4.0|A CHRISTMAS CAROL<br /><br />STARRING: The Voices of: Jim Carrey, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Robin Wright Penn, Bob Hoskins and Carey Elwes<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Robert Zemeckis; based on the novel by Charles Dickens<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Robert Zemeckis<br /><br />Rated: PG<br />Genre: Animation / Drama<br />Release Date: 06 November 2009<br /><br />When it comes to animation, it doesn't get any better than the master himself; Robert Zemeckis. He changed the face of animation forever with his classic Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Years later he dazzled all of us with The Polar Express and his legendary adaptation of Beowulf. Now, he's done it once more with his latest masterpiece from Walt Disney: A Christmas Carol.<br /><br />I don't know of any story that's been retold more than this one, and rightfully so. It's been around for nearly 200 years, and I'm sure Zemeckis's version won't be the last to be seen.<br /><br />I'll take the liberty of assuming that everyone is familiar with the plot, and just highlight the key points: Ebenezer Scrooge absolutely despises Christmas and everything to do with it. He has a massive fortune but not so much as a single friend, and treats everyone like rubbish. Seven years after the death of his partner Jacob Marley, he will be visited by the ghost of Marley as well as three other specters (the ghosts of the past, present and future) on the night of Christmas Eve. The ghosts will show him visions of his past, present and future and the life he has lived and will live, if he does not change his twisted ways.<br /><br />You get what you'd expect from the plot, yes, and you've seen it a hundred times in other forms, yes; but you have never seen it quite like this. Despite being a huge Robert Zemeckis fan and maybe even a bigger fan of Jim Carrey, I too had these same thoughts going in. But as I was, you too will be amazed.<br /><br />The animation is nothing short of incredible. Several times in the film, I thought I was looking at real people and actual sets, for a few seconds. It's truly impressive. This will no-doubt be a must-own on Blu-ray! The colors are vibrant, the picture is crystal clear and the sound quality is truly spectacular.<br /><br />You can see Jim Carrey and Colin Firth and Gary Oldman, hidden in the characters they voice, and it's awesome! I'm sure that the actors physically acted out these scenes at some point during the process in addition to the voice-over-work, as their physical movements are all very life-like.<br /><br />Jim Carrey plays Ebenezer Scrooge exceptionally well and we have never seen the character more hideous and vial. He is terrifyingly thin and oddly hunched over and looks like he's ready to croak any second. His voice is raspy and dry and it makes your skin crawl.<br /><br />If you are expecting to laugh during the film, DON'T. The laughs are scarce as this is a very heavy drama indeed. In addition to the drama, it's very dark as well, so you may want to re-think taking smaller children. The spirits are scary and there are several moments where things jump out at you and make loud unsettling noises.<br /><br />What makes this so different from other versions of the classic Dickens tale, aside from the obvious beautiful look the film offers, are the moments where Scrooge is visited by the ghosts.<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis wrote the script in addition to directing the film, so it is very much his spin on things. The three entities are all different from what we have seen in versions of the past and they offer a nice touch to the story, cinematically. They don't crowd the scenes they're in. They take Scrooge where he needs to go, and offer him minimal guidance and that is good for the kids; they will be able to learn the valuable lessons of this story, from seeing what's happening with the characters, versus the ghosts telling us and Scrooge the implications his actions have and will cause.<br /><br />We also go on spectacular thrill-ride adventures with Scrooge as he is hurled through the streets of London, and shot into the sky like a rocket.<br /><br />Zemeckis and his team of animators have created a gorgeous London for this story to unfold in. I think that's one of the best elements to animation; you can create interesting and majestic worlds for your characters to live in, without limitations to reality and visual believability.<br /><br />There are a ton of animated movies that youngsters will love watching, but parents would rather have heart surgery than sit through. There are also several animated films parents don't want their kids to see due to its content and subject matter. Disney's A Christmas Carol is something parents will find comfort in their children watching, and they will undoubtedly enjoy themselves as well.his team of animators have created a gorgeous London for this story to unfold in.

0783225857|5.0|This movie portays the actor off screen as well as on film. He stands up for the defendant and is a good attorney. His voice was wonderful to listen to and he expressed his feelings in his special way. The scene where the father and his son are seated on the porch swing is the way that people should remember him. When he shows his love for someone you can feel it and bringing the son next to him is showing his strong feelings for his son. Gregory Peck was a special actor and it is sad to think that he is no longer with us. To see him on screen makes you see the kind of man that he really was.

B0031ED20M|5.0|I know I haven't read many of John Grisham's books, but after this one I'd love to pick up another.  This book is comprised of seven short, entertaining stories.  They each have a very real problem that an average person may be able to identify with.   The two main things that I loved about each story was that they didn't take long and there wasn't hardly any violence or death.  Of course there was conflict in each; however, it wasn't overwhelming.    My favorite was the last story entitled Funny Boy. It had several humorous parts that made me laugh even though there was a serious message that Grisham was conveying throughout.  The relationship that formed between two people who led such complete and opposite lifestyles proves that one never knows who they may become friends with!

B002QB1910|5.0|Rihanna is back with her latest album `Rated- R'. Everybody was anticipating her album after the incident with her ex-boyfriend Chris Brown. I am a Rihanna fan but I put that aside when I review an album.     1. Mad House- This song is just an intro. It is a dark sounding voice that introduces Rihanna and the Album. It's basically saying listen at your own risk because it's a Mad House. 4/5  2. Wait Your Turn- It is a little different then what we are used to hearing from her. Nevertheless it is still a good opening song and it's actually quite catchy. The song is saying that she's back and it's her turn to shine, so the `Wait Is Over'. 4.5/5  3. Hard- This song is definitely new to Rihanna's previous style. It is a cocky song that is saying that Rih goes hard. Young Jezzy makes an appearance and even though I'm not a big fan of his but his voice worked in this song. It's also a very catchy song. 5/5  4. Stupid in Love- This song is obviously a song about her relationship with Chris. A lot of people will be able to relate to this song. It's about being a fool in love. Her voice sounds good in the song as well. 5/5  5. Rockstar 101- Definitely one of my favorite songs on the album. It's cocky, addicting, and overall satisfying. You will find yourself singing and dancing to this song in your bedroom. It also shows us a more adult Rih Rih. 5/5  6. Russian Roulette- The second single lives up to its expectations. The music gives an eerie feeling to the song. It explains how love is like a game of Russian roulette, that it's a game of chance. Her voice sounds phenomenal on the track. 5/5  7. Fire Bomb- This is a fan favorite. The song is once again about love. It's about your significant other feeling what you are feeling. 4/5  8. Rude Boy- My favorite song on the album. It reminds me of Sell Me Candy (My favorite Song on Good Girl Gone Bad). It is naughty and will have you singing it throughout the day. It was truly my guilty pleasure. 5/5  9. Photographs- This song isso beautiful. It's just saying how they could have made it but they didn't, so all she has left is photographs. Will.i.am made the song better, if that was possible. 5/5  10. G4L- I don't like this song. It gives a weird vibe. It does give the bad girl vibe but I didn't like it. Her voice and the music just through me off. 3/5  11. Te Amo- A beautiful song as well. I didn't like this song at first. It grew on me. The words `Te Amo' means I love you in Spanish. 5/5  12. Cold Case Love- One of my favorites. The song is different and the instruments sound beautiful in the background. Rih's vocals also shined on this track. 5/5  13. The Last Song- I didn't like this song at first either but it grew on me as well. It ended the album perfectly and left me missing the album after I turned it off. 4.5/5
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I'll admit I read and watch twilight, True blood was my raunchy dirty secret for awhile but this show...it has so much DEPTH. I gave it a chance even though I figured I would probably get tired of it and leave it at that. NO WAY! As much as I'd like to hate the beautiful Elena (like I did in the book...the show is SO much better and different then the book) She is so kind, smart, with spunk she isnt the swoony I'll do anything for you Bella type at all. She's caught between two brothers as much as she denys it. Who wouldnt feel something for Damon? He's mysterious, Sexy, bad with a good heart? He is such a complex character. I wanted to hate him in the first couple episodes, the way he treated caroline made my skin crawl, but as the season went and the more developed he became and the more backstory we got I couldnt help but think Elena should be with him. Don't get me wrong Stephan is awell thought out Character as well what with his trying not to be his brother thus being the very serious brooding type, But Damon makes me smile in spite of myself. Ian Somerhalder takes the character to the next level. I LOVE this show and can't wait for sept. 9th to see what happens next the season finale left me on the edge of my seat yelling \\"NO!!!\\" lol If you havent seen this show go on [...] watch a couple episodes. You will see what we are all raving about.

B001HN6940|3.0|Even I give the movie an A.  The Blue Ray fell short of expectation.  Even though you get more special features then the DVD 2 disk it does not very much.  They might have done special on the main actors but nothing on the dragon, the caterpillar, the white rabbit and many more they could have done.  And there is no director commentary.  They are probably going to put on a future Blue Ray to make more money.

B002ZG997C|5.0|This is more than just a movie, it is a message. To know the truth is to know the word of God. This movie puts that fact and many others into perspective.  In a potential post appoctaliptic world Eli given a mission to carry the last bible to the place that God has ordained encounters events that would take the heart of all people without faith. Eli finaly completes his task having kept the word of God in his heart.      The casting is wonderful and I could not imagine a leading cast both good and evil that better portray what the mission of Eli is.    The photography is just a bit light on contrast for most of the movie but it plays well in a world close to hell.    I have to mention the wonderful job that Mila Kunis did in her role. She plays a young woman who could not know the work of God, and has grown up in a world of the dammed yet she is blessed with love and goodness. Miss Kunis plays this most difficult role very convincingly and with great maturity.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I am a die hard Twilight fan I hate reading so I haven't read any of the books. I have watched all the Twilight saga movies and I must say Eclipse is better than new moon although it was very predictible even on the previews before the theatre. I knew that team of newborns was headed by Victoria. I am anticipating the release of Breaking Dawn Im hoping it is a Epic as they say it is.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly: The Complete Series is an excellent purchare. The Series introduce a blend of western and space-opera and the good plot contain action, adventure, drama and very comedy of course. The character are well and definite with a story captivate from the beginning.  The format blu-ray display a superior image and the sound is simply perfect. And the complete series in a single box- three discs- is an authentic luxury. And moreover, a luxury very cheap because the price is fantastic.  Indispensable purchare.   The film Serenity complete the history and is great too.
B001AQR39O|4.0|I really enjoyed the second season of Californication, but I was disappointed by the lack of extras on the dvds. I would like to see more individual episode commentary in future releases. Hearing what the writers and directors and actors have to say with running commentary usually enhances the viewing experience for me.
B000V9D5LG|5.0|Love this lens. I have taken some really great shots with it. I am a professional photographer and this lens gives me great depth of field and the bokeh is really nice. I highly recommend this lens.
B002BFBAWO|4.0|Director Greg Mottola famously worked at a run-down amusement park in his younger years, and that transformative experience serves \\"Adventureland\\" well.  This flick goes for a quieter, deeper humor than Mottola's smash hit \\"Superbad,\\" but it is no less endearing.    It's somewhere in the later '80s, and James (Jesse Eisenberg) is a smart guy cursed with a) a liberal arts degree, b) parents who are unexpectedly financially strapped, and c) who lives in Pittsburgh.  (By the way - is it eerie or cool that Eisenberg stars in two movies with similar one-word titles, \\"Adventureland\\" and \\"Zombieland,\\" that are based in theme parks where he plays the Michael Cera role?)  To raise the cash to go to Columbia journalism school, James gets stuck with a terrible summer job at Adventureland - a place that puts the \\"lack\\" in lackluster.    The theme park is populated with a range of supporting characters that is as solid and pleasing as any ensemble has a right to be.  One of the problems with these sorts of films is that the supporting characters tend to be one-note archetypes.  That's definitely not the case here - the supporting cast is surprisingly original and defies expectations.      Take the park bombshell Lisa P. (Margaria Levieva).  We first see her in one of those Sexy Slow Walks through Adventureland as all the guys stop to watch her lick a Sno-Cone.  Every guy's first reaction is, \\"I hope this is the actress who agreed to do a bit of nudity.\\"  Instead of being either a) a simple sexpot or b) a stuck-up rhymes-with-with coasting on her beauty, Lisa P. actually turns out to be cool-but-flawed - she even asks James his thoughts about God during a good pot-smoking session.  This is a real girl who just happens to be gorgeous - it's this kind of attention to detail that makes \\"Adventureland\\" a pleasure.    Much of the movie focuses on James trying to act on his obvious chemistry with Em (Kristen Stewart, \\"Twilight\\" saga).  James and Em are seriously into each other, but are kept apart by a variety of neuroses and conflicts.  In a lesser film, these two would be kept apart by silly misunderstandings that could be cleared up with a simple five-minute conversation - here, there are darker and deeper issues in play.  Whether these issues will be resolved takes time, and as a result we care about these two.    For those of us looking for a raunchy \\"Superbad 2,\\" \\"Adventureland\\" does not fit the bill.  Even though this is a funny movie, there are only a couple of laugh-out-loud moments.  For me, the funniest scene in the movie involves the park owners, Bobby and Paulette (Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig), as they confront a violent park patron - watching Paulette nonchalantly hand Bobby a baseball bat so he can defend the park's honor before returning to the finances was a perfect snapshot of the lives of these two entrepreneurs.  And there is a shot-to-the-groin scene toward the end of the movie that I found as hilarious as Homer Simpson did when he watched Hans Moleman's film, \\"Football in Groin.\\"     For anyone who's worked a bad job with great coworkers, this movie's for you.
B002SF9YUM|1.0|Let me say this if you are a Robert Pattinson fan DO NOT watch this movie!!!  It will change your view of him terribly.  His acting is good in the movie but to see him kiss another man was just TO MUCH for me.  However if you want another movie with him in it I recommend \\"Remember Me\\" it is a GREAT movie.  I have just recently ordered the \\"The last airman\\" and hope it doesnt let me down.  Like i said his acting is good its just not a movie one of his fans from twilight should watch cause he is gay in this movie not that Im against that but when a person has a crush on an actor its hard to look at him the same way after you see him  making out with a man no offense.
0307120007|5.0|This is THE touch and feel book, and has been a classic for decades, and there is a reason for that.  My daughter, now 14 months, has loved touching and feeling every page since she was about 6 months old.  She always pats the bunny, plays peek a boo with Paul, and puts her finger in Mummy's ring.  She never gets bored or restless like she does with other books that are unsuccessfully geared toward the toddler set.  It is a simple, soothing little read, with the perfect amount of stimulation, and the perfect length.  It took my daughter a while to understand how to \\"smell the flowers,\\" but now she loves to do that, too.  It is a joy to read for both parent and child.    For those who call this book \\"flimsy,\\" the pages and comb binding have been the format forever.  That IS the Pat the Bunny format, and it is perfectly sturdy.  Just because it is not big and heavy does not mean it is not sturdy.  In fact, many board books are so heavy for my daughter to pick up and hard for little tiny hands to manipulate-- and their pages sometimes stick together.  This little lightweight treasure with easy-to-turn pages on a spiral bound make this book sooo easy for little ones hold and turn the pages.  My daughter has played with it many, many times, and I do not treat it any differently from her other board books, and it is in perfect condition, just like the rest.  I think a toddler would have to go pretty crazy on it to rip it or anything.

1400034779|5.0|Precious Ramotswe has had a tough life. Her father has passed away after a long, painful illness. She's survived a disastrous marriage to a ne'er-do-well musician, and miscarried a child. What should she do with the modest legacy her father has left behind?<br /><br />Start a detective agency, of course.<br /><br />It's the first detective agency in Botswana run by a woman, and after a little hoopla and media attention, she settles down into the routine of a small businessperson trying to meet the monthly expenses. Who in Botswana is going to want to hire a lady detective, anyhow? Lots of people, it turns out. Precious is a natural detective. She has a sharp eye for detail and a good memory. She listens patiently and sympathetically to people's problems, and the clients begin coming to her, in ones and twos, then more regularly. She handles a variety of small cases-unfaithful husbands, rebellious children, con artists and embezzlers. She gains a reputation as somebody who solves problems.<br /><br />One day, she encounters a more serious mystery-a missing child may have been murdered, and powerful people are implicated. Memories of her own lost child haunt her, and this case becomes an obsession. She must find the answers, no matter what the cost.<br /><br />Alexander McCall Smith lives in Scotland, not the sort of fellow you'd expect to pen The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency, first in a series of detective novels featuring a woman in Botswana, but he was born not far away, in Zimbabwe, and taught law at the University of Botswana. He visits regularly. His affection for Africa and its people comes through loud and clear. This is a story that savors the slow pace of life on the edge of the Kalahari Desert, the summer's relentless heat and broad blue skies.<br /><br />Precious is a fabulous character. A woman of progressive ideas, and a \\"traditionally-built African lady,\\" she moves through the male-dominated culture of Botswana with grace and style. She's comfortable in her own skin, proud of her accomplishments, and filled with unquenchable love for her homeland and its people. No obstacle is insurmountable, given a little thought, and patience, and a good cup of bush tea. She obtains guidance from an obscure book on private investigation, and inspiration from Agatha Christie, but she doesn't really need it. Precious has all the intellectual tools a good detective needs, plus the confidence and audacity to stick her nose in where society says it shouldn't be allowed. She gains many admirers along the way, including two very eligible bachelors, but she insists she's through with husbands and wants to focus on her new career.<br /><br />There are no sensational crimes, intractable puzzles, or drawing-room confrontations in this book. The cases Precious handles might seem rather mundane, but they are of paramount importance to her and her clients. She solves them mostly through persistence, keen observational skills, and old-fashioned common sense, leavened with compassion for both victims and perpetrators. It's a very human story, and I was fascinated by the interactions among the characters. I didn't care so much about the crimes--Precious was going to figure out what happened, no doubt of that--I wanted to find out who she was going to meet along the way, and what they were going to talk about.<br /><br />Smith has written a very charming story, with an insider's feel for the people and territory of Botswana and its neighbors. Like much of Africa, the story moves at a tranquil pace that allows the reader to savor its images and characters. It's a great book for a sunny summer afternoon.<br /><br />HBO has produced a television series based on the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency novels, but I haven't seen it, and I don't really have any plans to.

B000BQV52A|5.0|I have just listened to this set completely through, so I'm simply going to offer brief initial impressions - but as I titled this review, Gulda's interpreations are surprisingly wonderful.<br /><br />I had stayed away from Gulda as a \\"fringe\\" interpreter (i.e., Yves Nat) an acquired taste best left to those who seemed somewhat fanatical about his musicianship. I was never too concerned about his \\"crossover\\" status (Keith Jarrett is another in this select group, a musician who simply went in the reverse direction when he recorded his wonderful Shostakovich) but I was concerned that I'd have another Gould sitting on my shelves. (I love Gould, though not his Beethoven although it is always thought provoking. But I can only live with so much provocation...)<br /><br />Not to worry. Gulda's interest in jazz is reflected in his rock solid rhythmic foundation to these works. His only similarities to Gould are in regard to his unquestionnable technique (minimal pedaling, extreme clarity) and in the later sonatas when he plays on the faster end of the spectrum. Personally, I appreciate the slower, more profound work of Richter, Serkin, and Arrau in these later sonatas. Still, Gulda offers very competitive interpretations.<br /><br />His speed, technique, and clarity work well in favor of the earlier sonatas particularly the earliest \\"Haydn-esque\\" sonatas. The adagio of the Moonlight is played beautifully, and at a respectful tempo. (Unlike Gould. Gulda's speed does not pervert any of the sonata's slower movements) Needless to say the presto is taken at a furious clip. But listen to the presto of #15 to get an idea of his speed - almost a galloping rhythm. This is pianism of the highest order - whether of not the speed and clarity of texture is your cup of tea is another matter. But it's difficult to resist getting caught up in the rhythmic vortex of Gulda's vision for these masterworks.<br /><br />Actually, the pianist who most often came to mind while listening to the set was Rudolf Serkin, who did not record a complete cycle. Serkin was of the old school, and Gulda is a \\"modern\\" pianist - more rhythmically alive and flexible.  Gulda, like Serkin has a certain cool detachment to his tone. (A Beethovian \\"Birth Of The Cool\\"?). While this objectivity is appreciated, I did miss the depth and profundity associated with the later sonatas. But man, this musician's fingers could fly! There is an absolute joy in his playing that makes these sonatas come alive with freshness and vitality. Imagine that - from a set about 40 years old!<br /><br />I completed the set of sonatas with a strong desire to re-listen to them once again. No higher recommendation would be possible.<br /><br />This box set is an outstanding value, as it includes Gulda's recordings of Beethoven's piano concertos as well, recorded with Horst Stein. These recordings are quite fine too, although obviously a complete concerto set has more competitors. While the playing remains strong, the sudden shifts in tempi and some odd accents caused me to think \\"Hmmm...\\" at several moments Gulda and Horst are in complete synch with one another. Orchestral playing is quite good too, making this a set of concertos to sit alongside some of the better known cycles in the repertoire.<br /><br />The recordings themselves are excellent - state of the art re-mastering of the late 60s Amadeo stereo recordings. This box seems to selling in the $35-$50 range through third party sellers now at amazon. It's a limited release, so it's bound to go up in cost. But at this price, it's hard to pass up.<br /><br />I will continue to return to Kempff and Serkin for the wisdom of their interpretations. But I am certain that I will be returning again and again to Gulda - both for the sheer enjoyment of his pianism as well as the desire to partake in a voyage of re-discovery of this \\"New Testament\\" of piano literature. Four and 1/2 stars. Five stars for the box, for Gulda's traversal of the sonatas, and Four stars for the recordings of the concertos.<br /><br /> I never would have thought that after 40 years I could still be amazed and surprised by these sonatas. Great music, and great value. Grab this set before it goes away.thought that after 40 years I could still be amazed and surprised by these sonatas. Great music, and great value.

B003OCWF6I|5.0|This movie was completely underappreciated in the theaters. My girl friend and I decided to see `Kick @$$' and the Losers on the same day. We saw `Kick @$$' first and didn't really care for it. After sitting through that, we were not excited to sit through another movie. Luckily `The Losers' was a far better movie then the buzz about it. Really awesome action and more laughs then some comedies. The big name cast also adds an extra kick. One of my friends also went to see it right after me and agreed it is one of the best movies this year. You should buy `The Losers'. You will not be disappointed.
B002VECM72|5.0|This movie was fantastic. Sandra Bullock was incredible as was the whole cast. The Michael Orr story is a triumph. I enjoyed this flick, as it seems most people have. Enjoy
B002QW7AJY|5.0|this is the best sci fi horror movie since aliens in my opinion. watch at night for a better experience.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|First let me say if you loved Star Trek the tv show as i did as a kid, this set is a must have. In order to make sense of the newest movie your children need to see where it all started. Then they will understand why you rave about the newest actors and just how close they are to their portrayal of the tv series stars. The packaged set is the way to go by far.    Second I have to give Amazon 5 stars for their much improved customer service. I bought the blueray set by mistake. In a matter of seconds I had shipping labels for the return. The credit was issued immediately. The blueray set was returned and I reordered the correct format. The set was at my home in just a few days and I was back to searching the galaxy in no time.    I have been an amazon customer for quite awhile. In the beginning it was not so easy to return, get credit back, heck even to reach a real person for help. I am happy to say this company has my loyalty once again. They have seen the future in gaining good customer service by simply answering the call and doing what they can to insure the customer is satisfied.    I'm off to that star out there to the right...  sincerely,  ej

B0039UTDFG|1.0|WOW Oprah does a really bad job I am so glad Amazon sells the original BBC narration version. I went to Best-Buy to pick up LIFE and they only had the Oprah disaster - I actually heard some of the Oprah narration on TV and knew there was no way I was picking that version up. I couldn't stand listening to her narration , I had to quit watching. She was 100% unbelievable as anyone that knew what they were talking about and she sounded extremely uninterested -like lets get this over with but I'll read it for the kiddies. I couldn't even focus on the show itself. My wife in the other room at one point just yelled out to me and asked what the hell was I watching  -- she thought the narration was atrocious from the other room!! It was dumbed down and felt like it was read by and uninspired narrator thinking the narration was for kids.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|Great buy. The price went down before I received my order and Amazon let me purchase at the lesser amount. Really enjoy the dvd and went to the concert.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Perceptions.

B000A6T1HC|5.0|It's really amazing how Cecilia Bartoli controls her voice! This CD comprises fast paced, rich, energetic songs as well as more introvert emotional pieces. It has a great sound quality. I think, besides the vocal parts, the orchestra also sounds very good. The pieces included on this CD are from the same period (around 1700 A.D.) as a more recent CD from Bartoli: 'Sacrificium' which contains pieces written for castrates. That's probably the reason why both CD's have a similar musical atmosphere.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|This was a great movie, you got to know and like/dislike the characters according to the role they played.
0142000655|5.0|Though the book I ordered was used, it came to me in excellent condition and in just a couple of days. I have read this book before, but had checked it out of the library. When I was wanting to read it again, I just had to have a copy for myself.  If you have ever lived anywhere along the Central Coast of California, this is a must read, John Steinbeck descriptive prose really take you there.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|I'm not a fan of Dicaprio, so didn't see this film as a new release. I then read the reviews and found out that it is based on another film/book/whatever. Anyway- I didn't start the movie with high hopes.<br /><br />When Dicaprio & Ruffalo's characters first get to Shutter Island- the music was a little much. There was a crescendo as if something terrible was about to happen as they approached the gates- then...nothing. I thought I had the story figured out within the first 30 minutes and literally had my finger on the stop button. Blood was displayed as a bright tomato paste, which annoyed me, but later made sense. I figured I had made it so far into the movie I should go ahead and finish; I could at least make fun of it. I am glad that I finished.<br /><br />Spoiler alert, there are a lot of things Dicaprio does in the film that are questionable considering he is a detective. He is left alone in a dark stairwell to fight a half-naked crazy, he climbs up and down a 100 foot cliff, he trusts his partner who is obviously in on the plot, etc. There are a number of situations that most people would have questioned but he just accepted. The twist at the end makes sense of it all. I found myself not wanting to believe the truth of his situation. There is an emotional attachment to his character and it is heartbreaking in the end to find out the truth of the \\"plot.\\"<br /><br />I like a movie that I can sit through, but I love a movie that I would watch again and consider purchasing. This is one to purchase.
B000U0F7RG|1.0|I bought this and this is NOT problem free. Some discs didn't play, some episodes have no visuals and/or sound for the first 20 minutes. Such a poor product for a great show.  Most problematic are seasons 4 and 5. Of course by the time you get to that point, you can't exchange anything from amazon (unless you are watching 5 episodes a day!), and are left trying to contact the manufacturers direct.    Had to watch missed episodes on-line, and buy the individual season in one case to compliment this poorly devised set. Clearly no-one quality checks.
B000FC10MU|5.0|Gaiman's wonderful imagination builds a whole world up around us and the protagonist, Shadow. As we learn along with Shadow, everything takes on a sort of dreamlike quality and makes you wonder how possible it all is. COULD there be new gods of technology?? WOULD they try to overthrow the old gods??<br />As Shadow calmly accepts everything after the death of his wife, you also begin to just roll with the plot. The idea that all gods ever thought of do exist is not that extremely radical of a concept, but the way Gaiman portays it by going back in time is engaging and adds many more layers to the story. One of the most interesting things about the book is how as the gods' motives get clearer, Shadow's character does, too.<br />I read this book in two days. Then I went back and read it again. This is an *excellent* book. BUY IT. It won't be a waste of your money.
B002VPE1Z2|4.0|For just an ultra compact camera like the Canon SD400 this case is oversized.  It is better suited to a mid-size camera like the Canon Powershot A series.  It is also a good size for a larger GPS unit.  I can actually fit my small Garmin GPS and my Canon SD400 at the same time (albeit very snugly).<br /><br />Overall I like the build.  The front flap comes down far enough to provide ample protection.  The sides are completely enclosed.  The velcro closure feels sturdy and there is a small zippered pocket in the front for storing small items like a memory card or a couple AA batteries.  It has a velcro secured belt loop which seems pretty strong.  It doesn't feel like it would accidentally come loose unless you really applied a lot of force.<br /><br />Anyway it's a good case if you have the right sized gadget for it.  For a small camera it's going to be rather large.  But if you want to put a second item in it (such as an Ipod or phone) then you might find it to be just the right size.
B000FC130E|5.0|Gaiman is a genius. His fantasy world sends you spinning into the world of London Below. Engaging characters, beautifully descripted settings, but just enough to let your imagination fluorish. I don't know what else to say, other than BUY THIS BOOK. It's just such an amazing story with lovable and dangerous characters. The beginning is great, the end is great, and all the the pages in between are great. READ IT. You won't regret it, I promise.
1400032717|5.0|I love to read and read everyday.  The problem is I mostly read just before going to bed and have conditioned myself to fall asleep reading. Not the most intelligent thing to do, I know, but it is what it is. As a result, I almost never read a book twice.  I would call \\"100 years of Solitude\\" my favorite book of all time.  I have only read it once about 35 years ago. So the other day I am at the library with my 11 year old daughter and this book is in the young adult section.  Now my daughter has a photographic memory and reads more than any child I have ever seen.  She is scary smart. I had not read a book to her in many years.  I was talking about how much I loved this and she asked me to read it to her.  Yeah, I knew there was some inappropriate stuff in it, but I had not read it since it was first released, and my memory is the polar opposite of my daughter's.  So I skipped most the F words, but it was hard to make it PG.  Who cares the book is unique, Christopher is one of the greatest fictional characters of my lifetime, and reading it aloud with the  Unique emotions of Christopher was a hoot.  I would not recommend reading this book to your eleven year old, but I would recommend that you read it.  I have not had a wealth of experience with autistic children, but I truly felt that Mark Haddon captured what it is like inside the fascinating mind of an autistic child, almost as well as Temple Grandin was able to do in her first person writings.
B001C1066E|5.0|I really love my new Naruto coin purse!  It's really cute.  It has a good snap on it, so it won't open on its own.  Big enough to hold many coins, but small enough to fit in a purse.<br />My boyfriend is even jealous of it^^<br />I recommend it~
B00005N6KG|3.0|I am an avid fan of these headphone and have been using them for YEARS! They are cheap, small, light and fit my ears perfectly. I wear them when training, running marathons, racing triathlons, traveling, etc.   My ONLY complaint, and this is a big one, is the durability. After a few months (3-9) months one of the headphones will stop working. I will move the wire around that connects to the earpiece and sometimes it'll come to life but then, just as quickly, is dead again. There's no warning that one of the wires is about to bite the dust. Next thing you know, after strapping on your running shoes and prepping for a 2-hour run you are only hearing music from one ear.   Since these headphone are cheap and comfortable I buy 2-3 paid each time I purchase them and while buying multiple pairs may be more expensive in the long run versus buying a more expensive set of headphones, I just can't find anything as comfortable.
B002RAREAK|4.0|There were very high fan expectations with this album release \\"Raymond vs Raymond\\" by the recently divorced Usher. The album has 15 songs with featured other artists T.I., Will.i.am, Ludacris & Nicki Minaj. Notable solid tracks include \\"Pro Lover\\", \\"Makin' Love (Into The Night)\\", \\"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)\\", \\"Mars vs Venus\\" (title of my review) & my most favourite song of the bunch \\"Foolin' Around\\". Divorce has certainly affected him quite badly, hence the album is very personal at least lyrically (he sings regarding cheating, too many girls in the world, three sides to a relationship failure story, etc). The overrall assessment of this  album is just above average with gems highlighted above, earning Usher 3,5 stars. Hopefully he would have recovered well from the pain of his divorce in the next album release.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I was skeptical, like many others - but I figured it was worth the small price to find out. I've been pleasantly surprised!     Makes a louder, but more importantly, fuller sound. Especially with decent headphones.     One caveat though - when I first tried it out I was bitterly disappointed by the vocals being almost completely washed out, as I read in one other review. I was ready to give them up when I realized that one of the cords (specifically the \\"input\\") hadn't clicked all the way in! Needless to say, it made all the difference in the world.     Recommended.    Update 2/22/11    Although the default distributor is great to deal with (very receptive to feedback, and willing to repair an out of warranty product for a small fee) I've just had the second one of these die. It works well for a while (in my case, a year for the first one and 6 months for the second) but then just... stops. The power light still works, it still charges like it should, but it no longer produces sound. Still, I can only take 1 star off my initial review - after all, $20 is a small price to pay for one and a half years of much better sound.     As for me, I'm upgrading to the E7 now.
B002QY9RMA|4.0|That Beyonce' Knowles is a talented singer-songwriter (though not prolific as she may want to be) there is no doubt, but she does need honest mentor to streamline her releases to enhance her art at this stage of her career : this was lacking in this release \\"I Am ... Sasha Fierce\\" with songs that should have been trimmed to 10 or 12 and these put on 1 CD only instead of the 2 CDs offered! I like the Disc 1 : a better real booty shaking delight with hits \\"If I Were A Boy\\", \\"Halo\\", \\"Single Ladies\\" & \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\". Disc 2 is dance oriented offering but not strong in general as compared to Disc 1. It's her third album release, this rhythm & blues singer (grammy award winner) has a great potential to go even higher, but only if she can get good & honest guidance like should have been the case with this release.
B0000047EC|4.0|Pat Metheney and Charlie Haden create musical magic on this disc. This is the kind of CD that is perfect for a Sunday Morning or anytime you need a musical getaway from the \\"noise\\" of the world.These two musicians have a chemistry that comes through on every track.

0525421580|5.0|Will Grayson #1 believes in two rules: 1. Don't care too much. 2. Shut up. He's pretty sure if he follows those he can make it through high school. But he's not always good at following them. The last time he violated his rules was to defend his best friend Tiny Cooper, who is gay, in a signed letter for the school newspaper. Now he doesn't have any friends but Tiny, who's trying to set Will up with Jane. But to accept would violate Will's rule #1.    Will Grayson #2 says he is trying to get through high school without killing himself or everyone around him. He takes medication for depression, and he hangs out with a girl named Maura, mostly because he doesn't have other friends. He's gay, but he hasn't told anyone yet but his online friend, Isaac.    When Will Grayson meets Will Grayson one unlikely night in Chicago, both their worlds begin to change in unexpected ways.    Will Grayson, Will Grayson is written by John Green and David Levithan, two young adult authors known for edgy teen literature. Their joint work is told in alternating chapters, with each Will Grayson penned by a different writer. In less skilled hands the result could be disjointed, but Green and Levithan each create a Will Grayson that is complex and conflicted. In his own way, each Will is isolated and lonely, unsure of his own sexuality and what he's willing to risk to be friends with someone. In his own way, each keeps his head down until something moves him out of his comfort zone and makes him unhappy with the status quo he has established.     There are big questions for teens involved, and mother-daughter book clubs who take on this book must know what they're getting into: questions of sexuality, sexual identify, friendship and self-acceptance. There's plenty of profanity to go around. But it's refreshing to see an honest look at what it means for a teen to be gay and the challenges a friend of a gay teen faces while supporting his friend. Will Grayson, Will Grayson is also funny, and it will be hard for readers not to fall in love with Tiny Cooper. In fact, at one point Will Grayson #1 says he's tired of playing a bit part in Tiny Cooper's life. In some ways, both Wills are playing a bit part in Tiny Cooper's book. Mother-daughter book clubs with girls aged 15 and up should find this book opens up a conversation about lots of issues that may otherwise not come up on their own. I highly recommend it.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|First blu-ray movie we've seen. The details are spectacular. Like being in another world. Really enjoyed it.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This product is amazing and well worth the price.  It picks up everything on hard suf=rface floos and most on tightly woven carpet. Vertully ends the need for a broom. The  instructions say do not leave in charged for more than 24 hours.  Make sure you follow thses directions. Otherwise the battery will not least.  I would recommend this sweeper .
0767853636|1.0|I swear it's missing parts of the movie. I Have not watched it in many years but I swear this version is missing parts that the VHS has. Sad really
1592402038|3.0|Was it the cute pandas on the cover? I can't imagine how this book became a best seller. There are far more useful grammar books out there. There are far more enjoyable grammar books out there. There are, in fact, a slew of grammar books that are both more useful and more enjoyable than this one.     \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" will teach you little more than that the incorrect usage of apostrophes and quotation marks bugs Lynne Truss. The book is easy to read -- not a bad thing -- and can be a friendly introduction to the world of grammar instruction and the people who care. If you're looking for anything more than that, though, skip this book and look to other authors' works.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|The second season ratchets up the action and suspense from the first season, while maintain the complexity of the relationships and moral dilemmas. I'm sure more people have gone into greater detail; I just wanted to add my voice to the huge number of fans and critics that love this show. Worth buying the DVD.
0545123275|5.0|A charming love story. Very sweet and entertaining. Read in a day. Gonna get the next book, Linger.
B000063DHL|5.0|After purchasing Powerslave it was easy to see that I had to buy another Iron Maiden album. The question was which one? By reading these reviews from this website and listening to the samples I decided on Somewhere in Time. And well I sure wasn't disappointed. This album is mostly a very fast paced rocker with so many solos and guitar riffs layered in each song you will have to listen to it several times to pick up on it all. Tens of thousands of notes are shreded on this 51 minute plus c.d. Plus Nicko McBrain plays the drums with a fury making the music all the better. Once again there are no fillers on this ambitious album. As of right now I really don't have any favorite songs, because I like them all. This is certainly a must have for any Iron Maiden collection.
0061537969|5.0|This book is touching in so many ways!!  It will make you laugh and it will make you cry!  I can't stress enough how good this book is, but it is a must read!  I own a copy and my husband is reading it now, then I will pass it on to my parents and other friends.  Whether you are a dog lover or not, this book will touch you and bring out many emotions.  Supposedly they are making a movie out of this book.  I can't wait to see it, but I am sure it won't compare to the book.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|When this came out around Christmas of 09' it was a choice for me, either Avatar in 3D or Shrelock Holmes. Unfortunately for me and my people we wanted to try something new and decided let's see Avatar in 3D. Man, I wish somebody would have told me. The movie looks nice but it was not worth the 12 dollars spent on it. I waited about the first 1hr and a half to see some action but NOPE. This movie gave me a terrible headace the story is very familar and the main actor is very dull. Don't believe the hype behind this how this movie made it past The Dark Knight is a mystery to me because it is just terrible.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|Ahhh, how long has it been since you've seen a current horror film that really engaged your mind as well as your nerves? Not since The Descent, as far as I can remember, and it turns out this film has even more going on in the brains department. It's also genuinely creepy and funny, although truth be told, not as scary as some others. But who cares?    We begin with clever little animal skeletons that form into logos. After the credits, the camera literally is born, coming out through the birth canal to greet our two geneticists, Clive and Elsa [named after two actors from Bride of Frankenstein]. They have created these two living lumps of flesh from the DNA of various other animals, for the purpose of deriving new pharmaceuticals from them. They are big shot scientists, featured on the cover of Wired, and they want to take the next step and start using human DNA. But no--they get shut down in order to process the new products they've just made. In spite, Elsa makes a special splice of human and animal DNA and throws it in an incubator.    That night they talk about having a baby, and Elsa says she doesn't want to go through childbirth. In a matter of days their creation is ready to be born, and looks like gigantic sperm. In a few days it dies, but turns out it has spawned a cute little thing that's like a cross between a bunny and a naked mole rat. Elsa begins getting attached to it and treating it like a child almost immediately. Clive doesn't like the whole thing one bit, but is basically a giant wuss, while Elsa is domineering and emotionally manipulative. Soon Elsa is taking the protection off of Dren's [that's what they name her] poison-tipped tail, and treating her like her own special child. When someone else at the lab sees, they take her out and hide her in Elsa's mother's farm. Not long after this it is noted that Clive and Elsa haven't done the deed in quite some time.    Now if you want to see this movie, which you should, I would advise you to skip thespoilers until you do. Especially because there's lots of crazy insane sexual stuff coming up, and it might be fun to be taken by surprise.    SPOILERS > > >  So they come to show the first two creatures to investors, when suddenly the creatures fight each other to [literal] bloody pulp! THAT was a surprise, and it gets a big shocked laugh when the whole front row gets spattered in blood. Uh-oh, funding for their projects is a thing of the past, unless they can figure out what went wrong. You see, it would seem that after the two beasties had sex, one of them switched sexes, and the female became male. So it's back to work for Clive and Elsa--but they have a big problem at home to worry about.     Dren is now a full-grown young woman, and wants to go outside. She's also developed an appetite for flesh, which Elsa sees and yet denies. Polley does an excellent job of portraying Elsa as an extremely damaged woman with a large capacity for self-delusion, while still remaining understandable and human. She also starts morphing into her own difficult mother, taking away the cat Dren has adopted, trying to bond while teaching Dren how to apply makeup[!], and jealous over finding a number of drawings of Clive--but not her. Dren, it seems, is becoming quite attracted to Clive, and you'll recall which couple hasn't had sex in quite a while. Oh, and by the way, Clive suddenly realizes that the human DNA Elsa used to create Dren was her own.    Now here come serious spoilers, which normally I wouldn't include, but we need them to discuss the whole subtext happening here. Nevertheless, you may want to skip past the spoilers at this point and come back after you've seen the movie.    Clive comes home, Elsa is gone, and Dren comes on to him, hard. He tries to resist, but ultimately gives in--and you KNOW who walks in at that very moment. This, and the Jerry Springer confrontation that follows had a large portion of my movie audience laughing uproariously for quite a while, whichI didn't mind, as they were just enjoying and getting into the movie. But here comes a significant line, when Clive tells Elsa she should have thought thrice about adding her own DNA given \\"what she knows about her family history.\\" We have also earlier heard Elsa describe her mother as \\"crazy\\" and learned that she has SERIOUS issues about coming back to her childhood home, where many awful things happened. She chops off Dren's stinger, and takes it into the lab, where she synthesizes the necessary protein [for their funding] in a snap. Soon after, Dren dies. They bury her. Then, she digs her way out of the grave--and is now MALE.    There follows a final battle, during which the now-male Dren rapes Elsa and kills Clive before being killed herself. There is a final scene back in the pharma office, where we learn that Dren's body has led to a number of discoveries, and Elsa signs an agreement for what we are to assume is giga-dollars in exchange for having DREN'S BABY, that she is now pregnant with. The last image of the film is the company representative and now owner of Elsa's baby, who is styled in a rather traditionally mannish way, standing at a window embracing the pregnant Elsa, both of them looking very much like an expecting couple.    There are a number of subtle clues that part of Elsa's troubled youth and problems with childbirth stem from her having a child via incest that died. This explains Clive's comment about how she should have known the issues that stem from combining similar DNA \\"given her family history.\\" So Dren has her DNA, say 50%, and when Dren switches sexes and impregnantes Elsa, the resulting child would have near-total incestuous DNA. As my friend said \\"Dren becomes Elsa's own father.\\" This is continued by the last image, where the company representative is shown in the manner of the father... and who is, in some thematic way, the father. So the whole movie becomes this giant mobius strip of incestuous offspring generating even more of themselves, and a statement that in this age of genetic engineering the question of who is the actual parent of these offspring becomes very murky. Not to mention the even more relevant idea of responsibility: if there are a number of parties providing funding or encouraging troubling research or actually doing the work, which one is ultimately responsible for the result? And if everyone is... it kind of means no one is.   < < < SPOILERS END    Not like we don't have enough issues going on here with all the thorny issues of parental responsibility and boundaries, Oedipal attraction, maternal passive-aggression and family mental illness. This is one of those movies that is exciting and maintains interest because of its ideas and how it expertly establishes a set of concepts, then continually throws wrenches into its ideological mechanisms.    That it has so many ideas is exactly the problem it faces at the end, when its climax can only come off as a bit rote. But I think this is because the whole movie that has come before has been packed with so many ideas and interesting character points that the last few minutes, with its need to wrap the whole story up in an action-packed way, can't really hope to live up to. Not to mention that the film introduces a major thematic element right at the very end that, given the needs to wrap up the story, can't be given the time the new development deserves. But these are quibbles.    Overall the movie is quite fine, moves quickly, is intelligently written and directed, wonderfully acted, has stunning special effects [the creature seems quite fleshy, real and THERE in a way that brings back the old \\"How did they do that?\\" wonder], and yeah, it's one of the better things, of any genre, I've seen in quite a while.
B002N8A14M|5.0|I like this Ipod armband and clip.  It makes it very easy for me to run and enjoy music or podcasts.  The band is easy to use and comfortable, and the clip and case combination protects the Ipod well.  Sweat has not been a problem for the Ipod, even with my hour-long runs in extremely hot, steamy weather.  The clip also serves well when I am using my Ipod in less-athletic circumstances.<br /><br />I am a happy runner now.
B00288KNLS|5.0|Bought this for my wife, she loved this movie, I watched it and found it interesting as well...<br /><br />Good packaging and quick turn around...i hate 3d so i can't review that for you...
B003RNZDKY|5.0|this is an ill cd! very well thought out n great sounds from one of the illest bands in the land! THE ROOTS!!!! so many instant roots classics on here, one of my personal favs dear GOD 2.0! stop reading the review n buy this cd now!
0316044938|3.0|(Warning:  Minor spoilers below, marked with ****.)<br /><br />If you asked me my opinion of this book while I was reading it, my answer would have depended entirely on what portion I was reading at the time.  This book is at times beautiful and moving, with vivid imagery of the afterlife and a young girl's transition there.  Sebold conveys the dissolution of a family in the face of unspeakable tragedy smoothly and credibly.  This is not a \\"we'll all work through this together\\" sitcom where every character is a pillar of stability and emotional strength.  It's a dark take on what often happens to families in the real world:  Internal strife.  Blame.  Depression.  Breakdown.<br /><br />However, my appreciation of the novel was frustrated by turns of plot that were the kind to make you sit back, roll your eyes, and just say, \\"Are you kidding me?\\"  (Spoilers coming up)<br /><br />**** For example, the main murdered character gets the chance to come back to life by possessing the body of a girl she knew as a child.  Does she try to contact and reassure her devastated family, or try to tell someone who killed her to ensure he can't rape and murder another little girl?  No, she just uses the body to have sex with the boy she had a crush on in school.  Let's just ignore the fact that we're basically raping the body donor in the process.<br /><br />**** Also, if you're going to end a book with \\"the bad guy gets away with it,\\" have the stones to follow through.  Throwing in a random event decades later that kills the bad guy just feels like an afterthought, so the writer can say \\"oh wait, here you go, happy ending.\\"  It lacks the gut-wrenching \\"the world is horrible and bad guys sometimes win\\" punch, but also lacks a sense of retribution.<br /><br />Overall, I would give the writing and imagery of the book 4 or 5 stars, and the bothersome portions of the plot 1 or 2 stars, and average it out to 3.5 stars.  Failing that, it will have to be 3 stars.  It's definitely worth reading to enjoy the positives, but be prepared for the frustrating moments as well.red for the frustrating moments as well.
B003L5LEYW|5.0|this is one of the best calbo cd's i have heard in a long time, im so proud of nas n jr gong for putting this together. excellent cd for anyone truly a hip-hop fan! this is not the typical garabage they have been playing on the radio this is real hip-hop!
0307454541|5.0|I strongly recommend this book.  The author has woven an amazing story, breathing life into all his characters, not only the main protagonists, but all the minor characters as well.  Fiction it may be, but you will end up caring for these people as if they were real. It is a riviting tale, and I am ready to push on to the second and third books written by Mr. Larsson.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like the ab workout portions the most on this DVD at Level 1.  I don't think Level 2 is as effective for me personally as Level 1 is.  I haven't even looked at Level 3.  The overall workout is quite good - she crams quite a lot into 20 mins.  I do not do it everyday.  I personally feel that you should give certain muscle groups a day of rest in between.  Abs and cardio are fine to do everyday but certain muscle groups - I've always been told not to work every single day.  That said - it's good, it's short and I work up a really good healthy sweat with it.  Make sure you are doing those squats and those lunges correctly and those arm movements too!  Keep that back straight and those knees should not go over the toe.  Jillian says this in so many words but only once or twice. It bears repeating.  Worth every penny - buy it!!  : )
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I've read all the reviews and I'm quite shocked and yet not surprised by some of the negative comments. In my nearly 30 years of being a fan of Doctor Who and even going to a few DW conventions in the past and reading some comments in DWM and the internet the ones who dislike or hate series 5 or season 31 are few and far between. For the most part they are hard core DT fan who are still not used to fact that he's gone. I was that way for awhile when my Doctor Tom Baker left and this new young guy(Peter Davison) took over. Within 20 mins of Peter Davison debut story I was won over! I never forgotten Tom Baker(who couldn't and shouldn't). But, I thought what was I worried about? This Peter Davison guy is going to be alright. The Tardis is in good hands. Even David Tennat said the same thing at Comic Con last year. My point is I thought Matt might be too young to play the Doctor. But I got over that within 5 mins of watching DWC. I was more concerned that Peter Davison would no longer be the youngest person to play the Doctor anymore. Matt has said how much he likes Pat Throughton's Doctor and that 'Tomb of Cybermen' is his fav story. You can tell that he pays tribute to PT in his costume and even the Tardis is similar to the 1st and 2nd Doctor. Throughout the series it pays tribute to pass Doctors every now and then. Which I think is wonderful and educational to all the new fans who just started out with DT and CE. Matt's Doctor (to me) is a mixture of Tom Baker and Patrick Throughton and judging from his interviews a bit of Matt himself. I love the fact that Amy is not all googly over the Doctor like Rose and Martha. She's more like Donna or Sarah Jane. I also like that fact that she really does love Rory and doesn't dump him like Rose did with Mickey. The only thing that I haven't like about the new series is the new Daleks. They look stupid. I never was a big fan of them anyway. I liked Davors better. Other than that I really loved series 5/season 31. Moff really came through. Some stand outs: The lodger, Vicent and the Doctor and the Vampries of Venice, and The Pandorica Opens. As of me typing this the 'Big Bang' has yet to air here in the States(this Sat it debuts). But, from what I read in DWM it will probably be on my list as well.ame through. Some stand outs: The lodger, Vicent and the Doctor and the Vampries of Venice, and The Pandorica Opens.

B000V5TV22|5.0|The BU 353 is recommended by Mac ENC (marine chart plotter).  I have a few gps receivers which work with various PC software but not the Mac.  Found it on Amazon for $25 less than from the software provider.  A no-brainer.   Fast delivery too.
0060920432|3.0|Reading this book made me able to understand why I \\"get lost\\" in a pleasant way in certain activities. (I know nothing about Jung , Maslow, or Zen.) The subject matter earns five stars for giving me that personal insight, but the quality of its editing gets only two stars. The book is repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. Did I mention that it is repetitive? Another reviewer said something like \\"it could have been adequately covered in 50 pages.\\" I agree. And publishers who neglect to create an index for a work of non-fiction make it difficult for a reader to go back to find certain information---not exactly conducive to learning. Good editing would have removed the repetition and included an index. In spite of the book's drawbacks, I'm glad I read it.
B003EYVXSW|3.0|This movie is not for the faint-hearted movie-goer. For those looking for something original with a dash of sci-fi horror and sexuality, this is the movie of the year. It's terrifying conclusion and other moments manage to cover up some of the more lax parts in the plotline, but they are sometimes still recognizable. Nonetheless it pulls the coup-de-gras for making you feel awkward in brand new ways you wouldn't want to revisit without good reason.
B002VECM6S|5.0|You won't have a dry eye in the house and the fact that it's a true story add to the emotion. Sandra Bullock is fantastic and is probably playing out the realities of her own life in regard to her generosity toward those less privileged than she is. A fantastic movie to be watched time and again. One for all the family
B002VPE1AW|3.0|The most beautiful blatant political statement you'll ever see! I loved the scenes of Pandora. The scenes with Jake and Neytiri running, climbing and flying on the Ikrans was breath taking! For me, the scenes in the Hallelujah Mountains alone were worth the price of the rental. The background music was wonderful as well!  If only Mr. Cameron would've made the movie as a sort of modern technical `Fantasia'  without any talking! The dialogue was weak. At some points it was laughable. The characters were blatantly one dimensional. The Stephen Lang character was a parody of himself! Sigourney's  character was consistently irritating. Also, it seems to me that a large portion of these Amazon reviews seem to be people falling into queues behind those who espouse Mr. Cameron's world view (or more specific his view of western society and religion), and those who don't. That's the central `vibe' I'm getting in reading these reviews. As far as the movie itself, I thought it was a movie worthy of the money it made at the box office. Visually, like I said earlier, it was amazing and cutting edge as Mr. Cameron's work always is (technically speaking). Avatar is eye candy;  amazing to watch and a joy to my visual artistic sensibilities. However, I completely understand why it didn't win the Best Picture Oscar. (The `Hurt Locker' at least was fair in it's portrayal of soldiers and showed  multi dimensional characters).  Like many reviewers, I didn't find the Avatar story to be too original. But, I guess that itself isn't why I'm giving it three stars.  Lots of stories, screenplays and movies worth seeing aren't original. They are just good stories that never get old. They aren't overly `preachy'. Avatar unfortunately has a  dogmatic  presence that is too in your face. If would be fine if it were just a generic  good/evil thing like `Lord Of The Rings'. But Cameron identifies evil with/as one specific  thing and benevolent good with the other. War loving U.S. Marines bad; peacefulbenevolent natives good; greedy rich bad; innocent poor good, etc. It's his sermon and he's entitled to it; it's obviously a free country. But personally I think he should stick to his strength (cutting edge technology) and preach less. The sermon (at least to me), is tiresome. I heard it with Dances With Wolves and I really get the message. No need to repeat it. This is basically Dances With Wolves with blue faces on a colorful virgin planet. I half expected Mr. Cameron to have the John Lennon song \\"Imagine\\" playing during the closing credits....    Imagine there's no heaven  It's easy if you try  No hell below us  Above us only sky.......
B00005OCMR|3.0|To all the four and five-star reviewers, let's be honest . . you're giving Tron extra-credit for its undeniable place in special-effects history. As a pure viewing experience, it's seriously lacking. Try to imagine coming to this film cold, without any nostalgia to sway your opinion or any historical context. Can you honestly say it holds up?     Its story is simple and goofy (which isn't always a bad thing), the dialogue is clunky at best, and the ending seemed like a major anticlimax. I made my four kids watch it with me last night to prep them for possibly seeing the new Tron flick this fall, and was struck by how thin the whole thing was. That said, I'm glad they saw it, as I actually think there's value to exposing kids to films made before they were born and before special effects had become so ubiquitous and \\"real.\\"    So let's be frank . . we admire Tron more than we enjoy it. Points to Disney for trying an experiment like Tron, and demerits for losing any semblance of that experimental spirit over the subsequent decades. But as a pure MOVIE, Tron is silly, simplistic, and a crushing bore. I wish it weren't, and I remain hopeful regarding the sequel.
B000002KON|5.0|This is a phenomenal rock opera. Unfortunately, it was greatly overshadowed by The Who's Tommy, which was released earlier in that year. Tommy is also a fantastic album, but I feel Arthur is better and would've been a greater hit had it been released by a more popular band at that time.\\"Victoria\\" is one of the Kink's best and has a first verse that probably would have fit great on The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. It's easily the best track on the album. Next is the incredebly catchy \\"Yes Sir, No Sir\\" which has an instantly memorable chorus. Another great track is \\"Brainwashed\\" with a very simple melody like the much earlier Kinks songs such as \\"You Really Got Me\\" and \\"All Day and All of the Night\\". \\"Austrailia\\" is a great glimpse on Kinks instrumentals even though it has lyrics. Shangri-la is a very haunting thinker of a song. It is also one of my favorite Kinks songs.Every track on this album is great.They contain some of Ray Davies's most satrirical lyrics. All the more proof he is an incredibly talented lyricist.Many people will disagree, but I would suggest buying this before Tommy. Both have loose storylines,but this one has no drab.
B000000WCA|2.0|The songs \\"Wannabe\\" and \\"If You Can't Dance\\" are the most annoying songs on this album.  I think this is the Spice Girls' worst album because they try to hard to be sexy on most of the songs and it comes out being fake and awful.  I only liked \\"Two Become One.\\"
B000PATZQK|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite albums. It's too bad very few people only know The Zombies for She's Not There and Time of the Season. Those are fantastic songs,but there was so much more to this band. This album is great proof. There's the hilariously cynical \\"Care of Cell 44\\" (my favorite Zombies song),the sad ballad \\"A Rose for Emily\\", the beautiful \\"Maybe After He's Gone\\", the haunting \\"Beechwood Park\\",the almost epic \\"Hung Up on a Dream\\",the childish whismy of \\"I Want Her She Wants Me\\" and \\"This Will Be Our Year\\", the terrifying \\"Butcher's Tale\\",the uplifting \\"Friends of Mine\\",and the most famous Zombie's song \\"Time of the Season\\". It really is a shame that the poor sales of this album caused this band to break up. Who knows what the could of accomplished if they had stayed together? This is an outstanding album that would be a treat for anyone to listen to. It's worth every penny.  P.S. Rod Argent is one of the best keyboardists of all-time
1400032717|4.0|I read an article that this novel was originally intended to be marketed as a Young Adult novel.  I'm so glad it wasn't.  I don't think teenagers would get the nuances and perspective of the novel.  They would just think it was poorly written.<br /><br />The novel is from the perspective of an autistic 15-year-old boy named Christopher.  He speaks and thinks in literal terms; everything to him is factual-based or in black-and-white terms.  Of course, he wouldn't understand the concept of \\"black and white\\" because to him they're just colors; he can't quite grasp the concept of that phrase because it can't be taken literally.  Details are also very important to him, and everything is mathematical or scientific.  He has trouble with emotions, but can recognize when people are happy, sad, or mad.<br /><br />The novel opens with Christopher discovering his neighbor's dog dead on the lawn, stabbed with a gardening fork.  He takes it upon himself to discover who killed neighbor's dog like a modern day Encyclopedia Brown.  What follows are his discoveries about the people in his life and his adventures to places and subjects unknown to him.  He gets the answers he was seeking, but also gets many more answers than he bargained for.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and the simplistic, yet scientific, manner in which it was written, but got a little tired of it by the end.  Thankfully, the book is fairly short for a novel and a quick read.<br /><br />Christopher is the only character that is truly fleshed out, but that's because everything is seen only from his point of view, and he only views people empirically.  His \\"development\\" throughout the novel is impressive, though, in that significant events change around him, yet he remains the one constant.  So while that's good for the stylistic approach of the novel, it also dampened my interest a bit because I didn't really get very emotionally invested in the story...much like Christopher.
1591843162|5.0|Initially, my intention was to title this review:  \\"Four Days I Spent with Seth Godin.\\" Unfortunately, my lizard brain wouldn't allow it because I didn't really spend four days with Seth Godin, but reading Linchpin made me feel as though I did.  Reading Linchpin made me feel as though I was hanging out with Seth, walking the streets of New York City with him, and absorbing his teachings.  He would point out people who were Linchpins and why.  We walked down memory lane as he showed me how businesses once operated, how successful businesses are operating today, and what successful businesses will need in order to succeed in the future.  More importantly, at the individual level, he showed me what it takes to be a Linchpin and why many people are never able to achieve the success they desire.  Before my time with him was finished, I had a new appreciation for art and it's importance to individuals and businesses, a better understanding of myself (and you) in the context of overcoming obstacles (usually our own lizard brain) and the true nature of gifts (not the birthday kind) and the role of gifts in becoming a Linchpin.  He went on to teach me the importance of shipping or finishing a project on time and sending it out into the world.  Let's take a brief look at each of the four days I spent with Seth:    During our first day, Seth gave me a history lesson.  In the context of business and work, he wanted me to understand where we are and how we got here.  He showed me the nature of left-brain jobs and why they're now going to the lowest bidder.  He showed me an old building, where clothing was once manufactured, but no more.  We visited unemployed workers who's jobs were now being performed by workers in other countries.  He continued by emphasizing the importance of creativity to a Linchpin.  With each lesson, I felt a sincere desire from him to help me (and you) to break free of the binding chains that prevent us from becoming a Linchpin and reaching levels of success we desire.  This day was fun, enlightening and encouraging.     Rising early the next day, I wanted to absorb more of Seth's teachings.  We began by visiting an art gallery.  Confused, I asked: \\"What does art have to do with being successful?\\"  \\"What is art to you, Ed?\\" he asked.  My lizard brain wouldn't allow me to answer.  Stepping back outside the gallery, Seth directed my attention to different types of art.  For example, a blog post, conversation, smile, the way an employee interacts with a customer, etc.  \\"All those are forms of art, Ed.\\"  My mind was broadening, as I was beginning to understand.  Art wasn't just a painting or a sculpture.  Art can be almost anything.  I could barely sleep this night, eager to learn more the next day.    We started day three at the zoo, where the lizards live.  \\"You see these lizards?\\", asked Seth.  \\"Would you want one of these little guys to stand between you and success?\\".  \\"Certainly not!\\", I replied.  \\"It happens every day, even to me\\", he said.  Seth wanted me to understand that our lizard brain is that part of us that doesn't want to feel rejection or failure.  The lizard brain is all about fear, generally irrational fear.  Your lizard brain wants to keep you like everyone else.  It wants to spare you the pain and anguish of defeat.  Unfortunately, your lizard brain isn't interested in your success, but only your survival.  Each day we must be wary of our lizard brain as it will keep us from stepping out and taking those chances necessary to achieve success.  Linchpins have lizard brains just like everyone else, it's just that their lizard brains are under better control.  Wrapping up day three and learning about my lizard brain was very hard on me.  In fact, my lizard brain didn't want me to write this review.  It was trying to convince me the review would sound stupid.  Or that Seth would read the review and think it was stupid.  Certainly, my lizard brain was more alive and more active than ever.  Taming this lizard would be a big challenge for Ed - a daily challenge.    Appropriately, I arrived on time, meeting Seth at UPS to start day four.  \\"How many gifts do you think are shipped by UPS each day, Ed?\\", Seth asked.  My lizard brain wouldn't allow me to guess, as I was afraid to sound silly.  Seth went on to explain the history and importance of gifts.  Gifts are powerful and the artists who freely give gifts to the world are those people who earn our attention.  For example, most of the information found in Seth's books is also found in his blog and it's free!  What does he receive in return for giving the gift of a great, daily blog post?  He receives a good feeling, many satisfied readers, the satisfaction of helping many people, and many potential book purchasers.  But the key to the power of gift giving is to not give the gift expecting anything in return.  If you do that, the gift isn't a gift anymore - it's a transaction.    To finish our four day adventure, Seth taught me about shipping.  Essentially, shipping is the act of setting a time to ship, a goal of what you will be shipping, and putting aside perfectionism and resistance to actually ship.  For example, I could edit this blog post for two months.  I could tinker with it, change a few things here and there, and write it over and over again.  What would that accomplish?  Not much.  Indeed, it's important to do quality work, but don't allow yourself to be hindered because you can't ship.  In all honesty, my lizard brain has been fighting with me about this blog post for months.  It's not a good place to be so don't allow it to happen.  Linchpin will help you overcome your lizard brain.
0307474712|4.0|I found myself touched quiet deeply over the story of Emma and Dexter who meet at the end of their college days yet form an unbreakable bond for their lifetimes.  The author uses a very interesting literary device with this novel, we visit both Emma and Dexter on the same day every year for 20 years.  I found myself voyeuristically looking forward to the next year as I read the last paragraph from the year before for each character.<br /><br />The story is a story of love, friendship, society and dreams. I felt very satisified after finishing the novel and anticipating telling my good friends about the book they \\"just have to read\\".

B002ZG994U|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun. The 12 year old boy in me absolutely loved it; comedy and stuff that's blowing up...cool. Best one liner in an action movie this year is definitely...'the devil walks into a bar'. The story line is based on the 1980's T.V. show about a rogue special forces team who have been drummed out of the army by the evil forces that be. Maybe General McCrystal can sign on with this elite team of desperado's for the sequel.
0307577589|5.0|AUDIOBOOK PRODUCT REVIEW<br />Let me start out by saying that the reason I'm only giving three stars is because I'm only reviewing the AUDIOBOOK PRODUCT  (as these are the product review pages).<br /><br />Simon Vance is a very good reader.  As a narrator he does great job of putting the emphasis where it belongs in each sentence and paragraph. With dialogue he gives each character a unique voice and he totally embodies the voices he chooses.  Since this is a translation I actually think I enjoyed having it read to me more than if I had read it in book form because I may have (just like with Tolkien) had the flow of reading interrupted by all those foreign place names and character names. Simon Vance speaks these with ease.<br /><br />If you are a consumer who intends to rip the audiobook CDs to your digital device there is something you need to know.  The tracks on the CDs are seemingly purposely tagged in a disordered fashion.  For example, when I ripped CDs 1, 3 and 4 on Itunes they ended up in the directory under /Stieg Larsson/The Girl With the Dragon Tatto.  When I ripped CDs 2,5 and 6 they ended up in the directory under /Compilations/Simon Vance/CD Tattoo.  The metadata on the tracks is not the same on every CD.  So once you rip the CDs you have to select all the tracks and re-enter the metadata to your liking so that all 13 CDs will have the same information.  It's tedious but not undoable.<br /><br />BOOK REVIEW<br />I was riveted to through my entire listen to this book.  I found the non-mystery related exposition on the state of financial journalism interesting and very timely.  I found the side story regarding machinations at Millenium magazine very interesting.<br /><br />I didn't find the mystery very mysterious but I still enjoyed listening to the characters work through all of it.  I enjoyed learning about the rotten backstory of the rich industrialist family.  I enjoyed listening as the journalist worked through different clues.  I also liked the jump between scenes of the hero and heroine.<br /><br />I especially liked the social commentary on Sweden's mental health/social services system.  I liked how Lisbeth, with her \\"issues\\", was an embodiment of what happens to people when they are thrown around by \\"the system\\". But I also like how, even though she was thrown around by the system, she was not a victim.oine.    I especially liked the social commentary on Sweden's mental health/social services system.

031236198X|4.0|On the surface, this book appears to be ridiculously simple, unless you've read Leading Change, also by John Kotter and realize that changing an entire organization is never simple.    This is another easy to read book in the business fable genre that takes advantage of the appeal of a good, if light, story. The characters of the story are the members of a penguin colony who slowly - some more slowly than others - come to realize that the iceberg that they call home is in danger and that they must find another.      Predictably, at first many penguins don't accept that there is really a problem and even as realization dawns on most, there are strong hold-outs that attempt to sabotage the change effort underway.  Someone who had not read Leading Change might miss the execution of each of the eight steps for leading a successful change effort.  But those who have read that previous book will appreciate the complexity and importance of the issue that Kotter and Rathbeber have handed the penguins.    Equally predictable: the penguins solve their problem, make a big change successfully, and the story has a happy ending.  Otherwise, there would not be much point to reading the story.    This is a light read, to be sure, but one that will appeal to those that would like to see the execution of the eight steps outlined in Kotter's previous book.
B002VJ0576|4.0|English cast, steampunk, and Sherlock Holmes.  What more needs to be said?<br /><br />If you want to read more . . . The special effects are good to above-Asylum-average.  Some of the plot points are ridiculous, and some require more explanation.  However, fans of Sherlock Holmes can fill in the blanks and appreciate the extra references regarding Holmes.  Holmes is both intelligent and heroic . . . and possibly a recovering drug addict.  Watson is not a bumbling idiot but is instead a doctor and everyman.  Watson is not subservient to Holmes but his equal.<br /><br />Despite the shortcomings, it all feels correct.  Even the ending makes sense and is fulfilling, unlike many Asylum movies.
0393072231|5.0|The was a compelling story focusing on a handful or so of investment professionals who saw the meltdown coming, and had the courage and conviction to stick with their trades despite incredible pressure and market momentum working against them.  You get to feel the anxiety and pressure that they experienced as they pushed against a tsumani of believers (who also were the uninformed).  Lewis is able to share his story with enough context and depth to offer a good layman's understanding of the environment, activity and transactions, but not too deep to be wading in it.  This is yet another page turner written by a gifted writer - you'll find it's hard to pull yourself away and put the book down - and it can be read in one day.  Here's a few of my favorite excerpts:    \\"The first sign that Spider-Man (Eisman) had no interest in Deutsche Bank's dark dealings came at a speech that morning, given by the CEO of Option One, the mortgage originator owned by H&R Block.  Option One had popped onto Eisman's radar screen seven months earlier, in June 2006, when the company announced a surprising loss in its portfolio of subprime mortgage loans.  The loss was surprising because Option One was in the business of making loans and selling them off to Wall Street, they weren't meant to be taking risk.  In these deals however, there was a provision that allowed Wall Street to put the loans back to Option One if the borrowers failed to make their first payment.  'Who makes a home loan and doesn't make the first payment? asked Danny Moses, putting the matter one way. 'Who the f*** lends money to people who can't make the first payment? asked Eisman, putting it another.'  When the CEO of Option One got to the part of his speech about Option One's subprime loan portfolio, he claimed that the company had put its problems behind it and was now expected a modest loss rate on its loans of 5%...Eisman raised his hand.  Moses and Daniel sank in their chairs.  It wasn't a Q&A.  The CEO sees Steve's hand and says, 'Yes?'  \\"Would you say that 5% is a probability or a possibility?' says Eisman.  A probability said the CEO, and went back to giving his speech.  Eisman had his hand in the air again, waving it around...\\"Yes?\\" asked the obviously irritated CEO.  \\"Is that another question.?\\"  \\"No,\\" said Eisman...There is zero probability that your default rate will be 5%.  The losses on subprime loans would be far, far greater...(and he walked out).    \\"Time is a variable continuum,\\" he wrote to one of his e-mail friends, one Sunday morning in 1999: An afternoon can fly by or it can take 5 hours. Like you probably do, I productively fill the gaps that most people leave as dead time. My drive to be productive probably cost me my first marriage and a few days ago almost cost me my fiancée. Before I went to college the military had this \\"we do more before 9am than most people do all day\\" and I used to think and I do more than the military. As you know there are some select people that just find a drive in certain activities that supersedes EVERYTHING else.\\" (Dr. Mike Burry, medical intern turned Hedge Fund manager)

0517548232|5.0|Economics in One Lesson is not only easy to read, clear, and to the point. It is reassuring for those people whose common sense is often challenged by the opinions of professional economists and policy makers.  It has become a classic more for the coherence of its postulates and their elaboration, than for the math, the graphs, and the jargon that often hide behind a veil of technicalities the actual simplicity of economics.

0525423842|4.0|I teach sixth grade ELA and I wholeheartedly, without hesitation or apprehension, endorse this book FOR YOUNG ADULTS. It has great purpose - to introduce inquisitive minds to the in/outs of the legal system, simple plot, easy-to-relate-to characters, and minimal detail ... all set at a fairly quick pace. The ending? Yes, it's quick, precise, and unclear. This book is supposed to be a first in a series, thus the cliffhanger ending. And it asks for the reader to take an action that many YA books require. Make an inference. You decide what happened. Better yet, find textual evidence.     No more crushing on Encyclopedia Brown. Theo Boone is the leading crime story hero now!    Please give us more, Mr. Grisham.
B002Q9MZHE|3.0|I did not like the film version but the singing of these two opera stars was terrific. Puccini did not complete this work as he was working on his greatest masterpiece, Tosca. The libritist (Illica) changed the sequence between the second and the third act making Mimi a \\"cheap woman\\" by including an affair she had with with Muzzeta's lover (The Duque). The change was not based on what inspired Puccini to compose this work: \\"Scenes of Bohemians\\" by Henry Murger. Puccini agreed with the change made by Illica as again, he was bussy conposing Tosca. The theatrical element of this opera is flawed, but the music is just heavenly.
B002N8A14M|5.0|I researched throughly before I purchased the Griffin iClear Armband Case.  The reviews were most helpful and the product did not disappoint. I'm a runner and also weight train weekly.  I needed a product that protects my Ipod and was functional.  This case/armband exceeded my expectations.  It is comfortable and allows for easy access to the control dial while protecting the screen.  I also like the clip feature which allows for easy transport when not using the armband feature.  One aspect of the armband I like is that the Ipod is raised slightly off your arm due to the clip providing no direct contact to the arm and perspiration.  The materials are quality and seem to be holding up just fine with daily wear.       I highly recommend purchasing this product if you are active and need a functional, sturdy armband/clip/protective cover for your iPod.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Reminiscent to scenes from The Road, Eli is walking on road with the land around parched and devesatated.  You come to understand that decades before, mankind had decided that destroying himself was the thing to do.  Washington/Eli comes across some bad guys who he dispatches quickly.  He is like a super hero.  There is nothing he can do wrong in fighting these guys who are trying to take what he has.  Yet, this is some very intense violence, some of the more gory violence as well.  There are some off scene but mostly quick hitting in your face type violence.  There are yet more of this to come.<br /><br />But the story moves a little slowly as he walks toward his ultimate goal.  Moving West.<br /><br />Washington is very intense in this movie.  Gary Oldman (Carnegie), is an ornery leader of a town where it is like the wild west.  They have water, some food, but not much else.  The decay is endless, and you wonder what town they are in.  Kunis plays a young woman who is basically a subject of Oldman, and she comes into contact with Eli and gets involved in his quest without her complete understanding of what it is.<br /><br />The movie is very good, yet, since there are times where you see the devastation and he seems to walk somewhat onward, it may have been good as a subplot to have Eli's early life shown as well as that of Carnegie's. Actually in the DVD extra there is a bit on Carnegie as a child and that may have been a good way to do this, injecting it into the scenes without losing the flavor or the moment.<br /><br />As you know, the book that Eli is carrying is the Bible.  There is a tug here.  The Bible is blamed for the cause of the disaster that has the world as it is.  Yet, it is a book of hope.  One wants it to control others, the other, wants it because he is destined to.<br /><br />The scenes of the bridges and towns after the destruction are intense and seem even real.  The ending is a surprise, gives you a wow moment for sure.  I like the Book of Eli and hope that it continues to find success.ccess.

B0000029GA|5.0|Before I begin, let me just address the majority of people who gave \\"Illmatic\\" a 1 star rating:<br /><br />I have to ask...why? Why hate on NaS' first album, which ended being a major contribution to hip hop/rap in general? Why do you say you are true hip hop fans when you show such ignorance to tight rhymes and stellar production? Why do you turn your reviews into a gossip section and/or a place to say such and such artist is better than NaS when the focus should be on the album? And then, why do you make such pathetic attempts at bashing his lyrics and how the tracks sound like? You are not hip hop fans and you will never appreciate a great MC. Do us all a favor and go crawl back under that rock you used to live in and never come out.<br /><br />Now on with my thoughts:<br /><br />I remember ordering this CD from Columbia House Back then, I haven't heard of him at all but I ordered it because I heard some kids talk about how good it was. The word \\"good\\" was such a understatement. This couldn't be a more perfect example of what a classic album is. He was already making the rounds in the underground rap scene as a great lyricist. He had a guest spot on the awesome Main Source track, \\"Live At the BBQ\\" and had one of his songs featured on the \\"Zebra Head\\" movie (Halftime.) So when it came for him to work on his first album, he had what any up and coming rapper dreamed of: the opportunity to work with some of hip hop's finest producers.<br /><br />DJ Premier, Large Professor, L.E.S., Q-Tip and Pete Rock all produced great tracks and because of that, the singles \\"It Ain't To Tell\\", \\"The World is Yours\\" and \\"One Love\\" were released and quickly made everyone realize hip hop has another great MC to call its own. And yet, while \\"Illmatic\\" did not sell as well as it should have at first, word of mouth was all he needed for everyone to look forward to his next album, \\"It Was Written.\\" Nas was able to carry \\"Illmatic\\" practically by himself with only one guest MC (AZ) on \\"Life's a Bitch.\\" From start to finish, every track is worth listening to with absolutely NO FILLER at all. So when it was done, you just listen to it all over again and again. Many other reviewers went into the details of his lyrics, flow and dynamics of the tracks overall so I won't add anymore to that.<br /><br />This was an album you HAD to listen to back in the days.

145360331X|4.0|This short novella that has become such a staple of our culture is a quick and easy read, but definitely rewarding.  In most formats, the entire story takes up only 50-70 pages, and could be read in a single sitting of a couple of hours.  Given this, you may hesitate to fork out your well-earned money for such a small amount of gratification, but if you can find this story as part of a collection or at a good discount (maybe an e-book), definitely go for it.<br /><br />The novel version of Jekyll and Hyde is quite different from the many movie adaptations.  For the most part, this version is more simple, with very little filler.  Stevenson's original leaves much up to the readers' imagination, making the story even darker and more powerful, in my opinion. Apparently, the idea behind this book came from a very real fear of Stevenson's that he might be living a double life, in which he would unknowingly sneak out at night to commit atrocious misdeeds.  Knowing this gives the story even more power, as you can sense the author's seriousness for the topic.<br /><br />If you haven't before, make the effort to find a good copy of this novel.  Written in only a couple of days, it is remarkable how integrated these ideas have become in our culture.  Recommended.
B003M8LL6E|5.0|After waiting for resolution to the storyline for months, this episode did not disappoint.  In fact, it made me say, \\"Wow. The writers are brilliant!\\"    The acting, music, and original score are the best yet--this praise being lavished upon a series chalk full of great acting, music, and score.    VERY RARELY do I ever watch a television episode more than twice in a six month period, but I've watched \\"Swan Song\\" 5 times since it's airing.    If you like a great story about what characters go through and what drives them to do what they do, and not necessarily a bunch of monsters running around eating people, you will enjoy this series.    Start off with season one.  The season five finale will be payoff enough, not to mention the great stories and characters you'll view and meet along the way.    Enjoy the ride--in a '67 Chevy Impala.

0061914177|5.0|Personally, the Presidential elections of 2008 got me interested in social media, as I saw how a skillful use of social media technology generated a network effect to successfully change the outcome of the elections.<br /><br />Both the social media technology and the people habits using it continue to evolve daily. The amount of literature about social networking keeps growing in step with the changes in this domain.  Unfortunately, none of the books can cover all of this topic alone.  That's why these four books make a small course in this most important field starting from<br /><br />  1. Motivation (Gary Vaynerchuk, [[ASIN:0061914177 Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion]]),<br />  2. Etiquette (Chris Brogan and Julien Smith, [[ASIN:0470743085 Trust Agents: Using the Web to Build Influence, Improve Reputation, and Earn Trust]]),<br />  3. Practice (Tris Hussey, [[ASIN:0672330652 Create Your Own Blog: 6 Easy Projects to Start Blogging Like a Pro]]), and<br />  4.

0307460444|5.0|i did not expected to get so much recipes as it has... it is full of creative ideas and a huge variety of recipes so you never get bored... i loved it!!
B002ZTIIXK|4.0|Almost every song on this double disc \\"Recollection\\" of k.d. lang's finest is a gem. I can't argue with any of them. Her voice is a treasure of emotional intensity and vulnerability, and her interpretive skills are with few rivals in modern music. So why not five stars?<br /><br />Well, frankly, the collection is skimpy. There's easily another half hour's space available between the two discs, room enough for at least one song from \\"Angel With A Lariat\\" and \\"Live By Request\\" or a couple more songs from \\"All You Can Eat.\\" Or a few more one-off singles, like her duet with Andy Bell on \\"No More Tears.\\" At least they did us the favor of only repeating one song from the \\"Reintarnation\\" set (\\"Trail Of Broken Hearts\\"). Oh well.<br /><br />However, the second CD of odds and ends totally justifies buying this set. It pulls a batch of songs out of soundtrack obscurity, like her original duet of \\"Cryin'\\" from the forgettable Jon Cryer movie \\"Hiding Out.\\" Or her tear jerking rendition of \\"So In Love\\" from the \\"Red Hot and Blue\\" charity project. There's also a new song, the sweet \\"Beautifully Combined.\\" And while I am not all that thrilled that two versions of \\"Hallelujah\\" are here, you have to admit, her version rivals the late Jeff Buckley's for goosebump inducement.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Recollection\\" is far from a bad collection of k.d.'s work. It's just that there is so much more to hear that I kept waiting for more songs to come out of my stereo once the discs were inserted.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|I want my six bucks back from the airlines.  But, I felt bad about demanding it.  After all, I did get to watch a re-run of Holmes on Holmes.  Far better than this sad attempt at remaking a classic from our generation.<br /><br />Clash of the Titans (2010) Looks like a cut/paste job of special effects.  Super-slow-mo hero jumping over angry beast?  Seriously...is that the best you can do?  I half-expected Lee Majors and that nunh-nunh-nunh-nunh sound from the Six Million Dollar Man.  The scenes were short and disjointed.  Big names like Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes should have requested their names be removed.  They had little-to-no screen time, and those few minutes were hackneyed character acting that could have been done for a fraction of the price with no-name actors.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor.  Skip it.
0525951113|5.0|Read some of the other reviews on here and it's all pretty much been covered. This book is awesome (as is the sequel Freedom TM).   If you're a true geek it'll make a lot more sense to you than if you're not all that tech-savvy. Especially all you programmer/developer   and or online gamer types. (like me) :)
0307454541|2.0|Hmm.. what was all the buzz about?  This is the first of a trilogy that is very popular and getting amazing reviews at the moment. I am sorry, but I wasn't thrilled.  The first 3/4 of the book were almost painful. It was difficult to get through and even disgustingly graphic and desciptive with murder and rape.  Not a happy breezy read. It's actually difficult to find an actual review that tells you what the story is about, which is understandable since the plot is so complicated and involved.  It is a murder mystery on crack.  It reminded me of John Grisham a lot.<br /><br />There are a crazy amount of characters that are all tied into this journalist, big time corporation, rich family, corruption and missing persons case. All the people end up connected and intertwined and the bad guys turn out to be worse than humanly imaginable.<br /><br />The author Steig Larsson did however do a good job at hiding the ending and developing very unique and quirky characters. The last 1/4 of the book was good and supposingly the series gets significantly better, so I may come back to the other two at the end of the summer to see what happens to the characters who I enjoy a whole lot better than the plot.  Ehh.
B002ZG997C|5.0|This movie is very deep and makes you think about yourself.  When you watch it the second time you pick up so many more things you missed the first time.  The movie parallels our lives on a deeper level with checks and balances.
0143118420|4.0|Eat, Pray, Love is a non-fictional story about a writer who leaves NYC after a nasty divorce to find peace in her life and God within her soul. She spends four months in each Italy, India, and Indonesia.  In Italy she learns about pleasure and good food, India is where she leans about peace and God, and Indonesia she learns about love and friends. Her journey takes her from a depressed woman on the verge of losing to life and is transformed into a truly happy and blissful woman who is centered and balanced. As you read you are taken on her journey and transformation both locationally and spiritually. Her writing style is unique and personal and her metaphors and analogies cause you to be quickly lost in her world and adventure.<br /><br />I was given this book a while ago to read as a Christmas/Hanukkah gift. I am not sure why it took me so long, and summer movie being released this year to pick it up, but it was fantastic. I have no idea how they will be able to fit such a jam packed book into a movie, but I strongly encourage women to read it; I can tell you right now the movie won't be as good. There is something for everyone and at every stage and the insights are amazing. You will find yourself at some point in the book saying \\"wow, that's me.\\"
1401323820|4.0|I liked the chemistry the author gave to the two main characters. I am looking forward to the next book to see how their relationship develops. I also liked the plot of the story.
B002ZG99G8|2.0|Most of the four & five star reviews rationalize the script and action shortcomings as simply the comic book foundation of this film. Well, I will go a step further and say that most of the action would have had the heroes booted out of 7th grade special ops class immediately e.g. how can a 100 lb female subdue a special ops commando that, besides vastly more experience, is twice her size? Even worse are the swinging round house punches that any beginning middle school boxing class would have laughed at (looks good on film though). That aside, the comic book graphics and freeze frames of people being dispatched was just cheap-looking filler. And, the doomsday device looked-like and acted-like a garbage disposal in the sink except the garbage was an entire island. On the positive side, that doesn't leave an environmental mess. I will give a bit of credit to one or two good explosion/destruction scenes. Acting - who cares, and the ever evolving one-against-many numbers keep escalating as if the latest film can't succeed unless the kill ratio is greater than any prior competitors' action movie.
B002ZG99G8|3.0|the action in The Losers is great, but in story will have you shaking your head with disgust.<br /><br />My biggest issue was the theme that the CIA is evil, operates like a crime syndicate, and murders innocent children for no reason. Secondly, the CIA agent who acts as the movie's villain buys \\"environmentally friendly\\" nuclear bombs (no joke, it's in there) from Indian scientists, to sell to ... China. No mention of Islamic terrorists, or even Islamic nations. In fact the Indian scientist who's involved goes on a rant to make SURE the audience knows that he is Hindu and NOT a Muslim.<br /><br />This movie has great action scenes, and hits all the right points; lots of explosions, special effects, and good camera-work. However, the Leftist propaganda ruins this film for me. The writers obviously have no problem casting our intelligence agencies as the moral equivalent of Satanic child molesters, but take pains to not offend Muslim audiences (although they're apparently not worried about offending Indian audiences).
B001FB5634|1.0|Two truely great actors...what were they thinking when they read this script.  No dialog and not any acting... one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Two thumbs down on this one!  Sorry.
B001AXME2S|5.0|The first Shinedown album I have ever listened to, but I am definitely going to pick up the rest of them.  Good, solid rock sound.  This guy can frikin belt it out.  His voice is amazing.  Start to finish, this album is superb.  Ignore the one-star reviews about enhanced cds that don't work right, or people pissed off because they have to listen to the same radio station at work all day long.  This record is great.  In a time with so much garbage being peddled to us by floundering record companies, a band like this stands out with great music.
B002HNA95E|4.0|I have not bought this CD and am debating whether I should. The reason is that my favorite song is not in this collection... \\"True Blue\\". It was not on \\"Immaculate Collection\\" either. Does anyone know why? That song had a great oldies sound to it that I really loved and was also a pretty big hit.
B002ZBD9Q4|5.0|First off, let me say that I am a big fan of Mark Tremonti's guitar style.  I was a fan of is work in Creed.  That being said, I never paid much attention to Alter Bridge, until I heard Myles Kennedy on Slash's solo album.  The guy can freakin sing!  I recently saw him in concert and was sold.  So, I decided to pick this album up.  It is excellent, start to finish.  Very diverse.  People say that this is a better version of Creed (Myles is the only non-Creed member), but I say they are wrong.  The guys really took their music in a different direction, and amazingly, sound nothing like Creed.  You take one of the best rock singers out there currently, pair him with a guy who really knows how to play a guitar, and a rhythm section that pounds it out, and you have a great album.
1400064627|5.0|This was such a fun book!  While it did have its moments of seriousness and development between characters, there was a lot of joy and jokes in this book as well.  Flagg certainly has written a classic in my opinion.<br /><br />There are two main story lines in this book, with little snippets of newspaper articles thrown in.  The narrator storyline would probably be between Evelyn and Mrs. Threadgoode in the time line of the 80's.  Evelyn visits with her husband every Sunday to see his mother in the nursing home.  Since his mother isn't particularly nice to her, she uses the time to go by herself and sneak in candy.  This changes one Sunday when Mrs. Threadgoode sits in the same area with her and begins talking.  And doesn't stop.  This continues on each Sunday until Evelyn begins to look forward to the lady and her stories and starts sharing her snacks with her.  Through the stories she is able to overcome problems of her own and feel like she belongs somewhere.<br /><br />The next storyline involves the people in the stories.  The people who frequented the Whistle Stop Cafe in its heyday.  The time line ranges from the very early 1900's to almost the time of Evelyn and Mrs. Threadgoodes story.  Must prominently featured in this time line are the owners of the cafe, Idgie and Ruth.  It tells of how they meet, what happens in their lives, and the friends and adventures they have.  There are a few sad moments including topics such as death, abuse, and accidents, but the majority of the stories are very light hearted.  Also with these chapters there's a smaller chapter written by the towns postal service worker as a news article for the paper.  It usually mentions an event that the storyline goes on to tell in greater detail.<br /><br />All the characters were wonderfully complex.  They had distinct personalities and fit into the story well.  I especially love how Evelyn grew in the book.  She went from downtrodden to angry to an uplifted person.<br /><br />The writing was mostly easy to read.  At first I drove myself crazy trying to keep up with what date was what for the chapters, but finally I gave up and just concentrated on the story.  I found that that improved the book greatly for me and honestly, the dates really didn't matter so much.  As far as the language goes this was written to be an honest telling of the South in that era and as such, it isn't very politically correct.  This could offend some people potentially.<br /><br />There was one thing that wasn't very fitting (and could be a spoiler, this is your warning) was the relationship between Idgie and Ruth.  While it wasn't so much the possibility of the relationship that was unusual, it was the way no one batted an eye at it.  For the times that seemed very progressive as there are still a lot of people who are homophobic even in today's world.  Instead of trying to make sense of it in an accurate fashion, I just told myself that Idgie acted so much like a boy that maybe everyone forgot she was a girl.  Regardless, it was nice to see how these differences were accepted in the novel even if it wasn't realistic.<br /><br />Great story and I've heard the movie is just as good.  I may have to go see it now.<br /><br />Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe<br />Copyright 1987<br />395 pages + a few pages of mouthwatering southern recipesirst I drove myself crazy trying to keep up with what date was what for the chapters, but finally I gave up and just concentrated on the story.

B0000844I8|3.0|I came to this movie rather late and I haven't watched the TV series. However, I do enjoy science fiction when it's well done so I thought I'd give it a try.    The first part was just fine. It was reminiscent of 'Close Encounters Of The Third Kind', from which it clearly borrowed a couple of ideas. The main characters were well-established, the concept was intriguing and the special effects were realistic enough to allow disbelief to be suspended. Once the voyagers got to the other end of the stargate, the world they found was both inhospitable yet somewhat familiar, enough to make the concept of humans being relocated there not altogether implausible.    The problem is that from there the movie changed. Suddenly the quality of writing and the plot twists dropped to those of a 1950s B-movie. So many cliches were included- the mysterious woman from another planet with whom the hero falls in love, the young rebel reminding the grieving military father of his dead son, the brave peasants revolting against the infinitely superior weapons of the slave masters. Most of all, the cheesy faux-Egyptian villains, totally unbelievable despite a deliciously creepy performance from Jaye Davidson. The fights were hokey and badly staged and although the climax was well-realized, by that time I'd ceased to care.    It's not a bad film overall, but it could have been a lot better. Had the strong writing and concepts of the first part of the movie been kept up, it would have been very good indeed. As it is, it's a three-star movie. Why anyone would give it five stars when movies like 'Close Encounters' and 'Contact' did it so much better, I'm not sure.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|The latest spy thriller to hit the box office, 'Salt', starring Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, Chiwetel Ejiofor, written by Kurt Wimmer and Brian Helgeland, and directed by Philip Noyce, is a cat and mouse game with a plot straight from the good ol' days of James Bond that does what Bond used to do- entertain you.<br /><br />The movie opens two years prior to current events with CIA operative Evelyn Salt (Jolie) being interrogated in a North Korean prison.  She's released in a prisoner exchange- against standard spy protocol- not so much at the behest of the CIA but the man who's her current cover assignment and love interest, Krause, a German arachnologist (spider biologist).<br /><br />Fast forward to present times and on the day of her anniversary Salt and her supervisor Tom Winter (Schreiber) interview a 'walk-in'- a spy who literally hands themselves over- in the presence of Peabody (Ejiofor), from Internal Affairs.  This man, Orlov, spins a tale about the KA-12 Project: Russian sleeper agents trained since childhood and integrated throughout the United States in preparation for 'Day X', the deadliest covert strike against US Imperialism imaginable- beginning with the assassination of the Russian President on American soil.  The assassin's name... Evelyn Salt.<br /><br />Orlov manages a bloody escape from custody, placing Salt squarely in the CIA's sights.  Now suspected of being a sleeper agent and her husband gone missing, Salt engineers her own escape and heads to New York where the Russian president will be appearing at a funeral service.  Despite Peabody and Winter leading the hunt, she manages to infiltrate the church.  Yet even after surrendering to the police she once again slips her captors, leading to even more questions: is Salt really a Russian sleeper agent?  Why has her husband disappeared?  Who are the KA-12 agents...?<br /><br />The performances are pretty solid throughout; Jolie's desperation and determination, Schreiber's professional calm and Ejiofor's active disbelief all come off good- though Ejiofor sometimes looks constipated instead of cynical.  The pacing is good, too- with slices of Salt's life interspersed through the action to show us what she's fighting for.  And it's always good to see veteran actor Andre Braugher in anything, but like Laurence Fishburne in Predators, there wasn't anything for him to do other than collect a check.  The action sequences are impressive and inventive- Jolie gets down and dirty in this one and handles herself well (my personal faves were her takedowns of the two main bad guys and her creative use of a taser to escape the police).  Some of the scenes are reminiscent of earlier Bond films, or even MacGyver but it's all part of the fun.  The highway chase was clearly inspired by the one from Matrix Reloaded, but that's ok, too.<br /><br />'Salt' is Jason Bourne-lite with lots of action and decent attention to detail, and even if the ending felt a bit rushed it's still pretty entertaining.  The only real downside is once the big plot twist is revealed, you already know the others.  But it's a fun ride and worth 90 minutes of your summer.  And for those of us who are a certain age, I won't even make any cracks about the sequel's potential title: Salt II...f all come off good- though Ejiofor sometimes looks constipated instead of cynical.

B002P8O29K|5.0|I was an impressionable teen when I saw Gimme Shelter for the first time. Living in northern CA when this all happened, I got to watch the entire drama play out on the evening news. The second time I watched it was at the old Ventura Theater as part of a midnight triple feature (remember those?) with Pacific Vibrations and [[ASIN:B00003ETIU Zachariah (Ws)]].    Anyway, this movie is a surreal trip into the bad boy Stones' image, and a truly amazing \\"rockumentary\\" that followed an amazing band during an amazing time in our cultural & musical histories.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|this is an album you can listen to over, and over, and over again. it flows beautifully and is a perfect example of why \\"the roots\\" are the most original and creative hip-hop band/group in the game today. at least i think so. i love them, my girl loves them and her son can learn from them. especially from this album which showcases black thought's ability to truly express his raw emotions over excellent tracks. he is without a doubt my favorite m.c. and has been for some time. the only drawback to some of \\"the roots\\" previous albums was production fluidity. this album definitely has that down to a science (with the exception of the last two tracks). they are good tracks, just a little out of place in the grand scheme of the album. so for any \\"true\\" roots fan this is a must own album. if you don't like it then i would have to say you don't really like what they are about.
B003CIG7AE|5.0|It looks like the boys from the Pacific Northwest have found a home in the South with \\"Infinite Arms,\\" a beautiful, slick, alt-country album that matches up to their earlier brilliance and continues to place the Band of Horses in the upper echelon of music. Often reminiscent of Wilco's [[ASIN:B00000I5JS Summerteeth]], THE album of the first half of 2010 \\"Arms\\" provides the listener with great melodies, smooth grooves, and a bit of experimental production.<br /><br />Highlights are the up-tempo \\"Compliments,\\" which starts off with the Jim Morrisson-esque lyrics, \\"I'm fixin' a drink in the morning with the way things are,\\" and probably the catchiest tune on the 12-tracker, \\"Older,\\" which puts the listener in the heart of Texas with a bottle and good friends. \\"Older\\" could have easily come from an Eagles album, but fits perfectly in \\"Arms.\\" The upbeat \\"Dilly\\" is a fun summer jam for the kids and \\"On My Way Back Home\\" is a pocket symphony for the ages.<br /><br />The CD comes complete with a collection of individual photos that compliment the music and offer a glimpse into the band's life.<br /><br />After five years, this band has produced some of the best music of their time and this album is no let down. Buy it and take a road trip. You'll thank me later.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|No good.  I must admit, every time I watch a  nature video and David Attenbourgh is not narrating, I am disappointed. Oprah is not even slightly a good replacement, however.  She sounds like she is trying to entertain a roomful of kids.  The score is very distracting from the beautiful imagery.  Instead of the organic instruments they have used in the past, it now sounds like a mutated version of Toy Story.  The whole thing would be totally awesome if I were seven again, but I need more.  The info is lacking, the narrating is unbelievable and uninspired, the sound effects are obnoxious...a true disappointment, but not nearly as disappointing as it is for all the photographers who slaved and provided stunning visuals, the only reason this got any stars at all.  It might be beautiful on mute, but the audio ruins it all.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|Do not buy from Wholesale AV.  The company shipped me a broken unit and it took weeks of them giving me the run around to get a return number in order to ship it back.  They do not follow through with what they are going to do and their only plan on customer support is to contact the manufacturer.  All and all very poor, disappointing service, especially when you take into account they shipped a broken unit to a customer and then refuse to expedite service and take care of that customer.  Truly an awful company - BUYER BEWARE!

9889979942|5.0|For so many Americans, the thought of China fosters mental images of consumption, pollution and a heavy handed government presence.  China, Portrait of a People, forces those stereotypes to retreat into the background by providing a stunning compilation of photos and captions that highlight the Chinese as individuals.  Carter's ability to capture the distinct personality of each subject allows the reader a glimpse into the soul of the Chinese people - very different from our own, and yet, in many ways, so relatable.      One can almost feel the joy, the anger, the passion of the people pictured.  I think some of my favorite shots were those that offered geographic context - gorgeous landscapes, ancient structures, abject poverty, urban glam (or grit, depending...)- for the people and situations caught on film.  That allowed the book to surprise me... finding beauty and innocence where none was expected, and seeing images of emotions, felt so many times in my life, in the lives of people whose worlds are completely different from my own.      I highly recommend this book and would love to see the same type of work done here in the states!
B0007CNXUK|4.0|I knew I would like the movie, so that was not a problem. The shipping just seemed to take longer than the usual, comparing to other purchases on amazon.

Other than shipping time, I am satisfied with my purchase.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Why is everyone complaining about the last episode of \\"Lost\\"? Honestly, how did you think it would end? A weird, innovative and complex series like \\"Lost\\" obviously needed a weird, innovative and complex last episode!<br /><br />Personally, I got it. The alternative timeline was in the future, when all the characters had died and their souls gathered in a waiting room to Heaven. I suppose Christian Shepherd's name and empty coffin was an allusion to the resurrection of you-know-who. The other episodes of the last season answered other pressing questions: Where did Jacob and the Man in Black come from? How did Richard get to the island? Not a bad finale, all things considered.<br /><br />The main problem with \\"Lost\\" is that, frankly, the people behind it came dangerously close to loosing it. For starters, the series was too long. The same story could easily have been told in just four seasons. Or even less. After a while, the story became unwieldy in the extreme, with all the subplots and supplementary characters, many of whom were of little interest. Frankly, who cares about Charlotte? The constant jumps back and forth in time became involuntary comic relief after about the dozenth jump. Obviously, it became impossible to answer all the questions raised by these complexities. But then, this was obvious to discerning viewers already three years ago... My favourite meaningless question never answered was: Why did Mr. Eko build a church? And why did good ol' Smokie kill him?<br /><br />Well, who knows? ;-)<br /><br />So why did I keep watching \\"Lost\\", despite knowing that all the loose ends would never be tied up? I think it was the splendid actors and the intriguing characters with their weird life stories. In fact, the flashbacks were often more interesting than the actual story of the island! Who can forget John Locke being conned by his own father, the long cons of Sawyer, the ugly, crazy and lovable Hugo Reyes, or the beautiful and homicidal Kate? Then there's Lapidus, the pilot who looks like a guy from a Burt Reynolds movie, fished out of the water just at the right time for the grand finale. Is that a continuity error?<br /><br />Despite not answering EVERYTHING, I do believe \\"Lost\\" somehow found itself in this last season.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad show.<br /><br />Now, I'm off to see Jacob, LOL.ike a guy from a Burt Reynolds movie, fished out of the water just at the right time for the grand finale.

B003TTIXOO|5.0|Excellent preview of Greys Anatomy Season 6 - of course I would have liked to seen more.  I pre-ordered this box set in April for what was then August release, and now I have to wait til September - not happy about that at all.  Callie's reaction to George's passing was a bit surprising and it was a lovely tribute to the type of person her character is, and that George really was HER \\"McDreamy\\" - even after all of the history.  I was/am so sorry to see George's character written out of the show - I thought he was great - a great balance - funny, smart, sensitive, loving and caring.  But, it's a show and it's his life - he is so talented he's got a lot of acting to do beside Greys.  Just my opinion.

B000002L9Y|3.0|The \\"classic\\" Fleetwood Mac line-up released just five recordings during its decade plus of existence. The first four are excellent and although none sounded better than Tango this is my least favourite. Tango is very much a child of the eighties and, as such, several of the songs do sound dated (Little Lies, Family Man). I find that I can play nearly any FM song from any other album in the band's repertoire and it will not sound out of place in 2010. Play almost any song from Tango and it will scream out \\"late eighties.\\"  To me Tango In The Night is for the most part well played, well produced and great sounding generic pop/rock. I like the title song, Nicks' Seven Wonders and McVie's rocking Isn't It Midnight. Big Love is a sensational song. Sadly, other than the one song, Stevie's contributions are not up to her normal high standards. This is not a CD that I'll be revisiting soon

B003IPC5SO|5.0|Never a huge Kylie fan but always loved listening to her music.  This album makes me a HUGE fan!!!  Every song is fantastic.  I love disco and this is a perfect disco album.  Every song is a new adventure and to be honest, this album has a drug-like effect when you listen to it from start to finish.  It's been complimenting my margarita's and hard iced tea very well!!!  I say JUST BUY IT!!!  Definately planning on a vaca to Australia to see her in concert when she tours on this album.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|This was an amazing purchase.  I bought it for my husband's birthday, and he absolutely loved it! I did buy the video narrated by D. Attenborough vs Oprah, I think this scored a few points with the birthday boy :)
B000006TRV|4.0|AS FAR AS EVERYONE KNOWS, THIS WAS A GOOD CD. SOME OF THE SONGS JUST RAMBLED ALONG, BUT IT WAS GOOD. THE TRANSACTION AND PURCHASE WAS WELL PERFORMED.
055357342X|1.0|It's almost too embarrassing to admit that I've read this ridiculous trash, it was at times juvenile fun but mostly just an overlong boring slog through an endless parade of heraldry and sigils. George RR Martin is just one of those fantasy authors who is better suited to writing for the want ads. If you disagree with this review you only prove my point.
B000002KXO|4.0|This is commercial pop with a capital C. Perhaps the band did record this album with the intention of recapturing the fans who deserted them three years earlier (Tusk - great double LP that it is). Perhaps Mirage was just a throwaway effort. Who knows and who cares? I must admit that although I hadn't listened to Mirage in many years when I did give it a play this afternoon I was pleasantly surprised. There are a couple of really great songs (That's Alright, Gypsy, Only Over You, Straight Back) and a number of good ones. I even like the Lindsey Buckingham compositions that so many consider weak. This is a better than average recording, certainly a worthy addition to Mac's discography. I'm glad to have re-discovered this music.
0060536357|4.0|For a true story, it has all the ups and downs and excitement of a John Grisham novel.
0143039431|5.0|There are books that you read for entertainment and books that you read because you have been told you should. This is a novel I had been told to read for years. I heard from everyone how much I would love it. So I tried several times and just could not get into it. It didn't grab me right from the start as some stories do. Then, one day, I decided to give it one last try. For whatever reason I was finally ready and wow, did I love it! The plight of the Joad family evoked such a combination of despair and hope that I felt as though my heart would burst. I had read Steinbeck before, (\\"East of Eden\\" is one of my favorites), but \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is so relevant to the present economic situation in this country that it really struck a chord with me. I imagine there are many American families living a modern-day version of this story. Steinbeck was a master and his vision extends into a future we can only imagine. I don't think you can rate this novel on the same scale as other works sold on Amazon. If I could I would give it ten stars, at least.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|Excellent series. Watched over several nights. Could not wait until the next night to see more. Was disappointed when finished. Can't wait until the next season.
6304712936|4.0|I received this video quickly and was very pleased with the quality of a used video.  I had searched on other sites but, as much as I wanted the movie, I couldn't pay the average asking price of $20. I will use this seller again.
B002MCJZHS|4.0|This is an interesting minimalist cool Cd with echoes of Joy Division (and, therefore, New Order), the early Cure, the Bristol bands like Portishead and most of all The Durutti Column. Some of the negative reviewers have criticized both vocalists as being technically deficient. They are missing the point. The sparse conversationalist singing suits both lyrics and music perfectly. The XX have made one of 2009's best debuts.

B000P0J09W|5.0|There are very few films that really stick with you from childhood on until today.  See when I was a kid and I first saw Goonies it was like a little adventure you were preparing for.  You had your blanket it was dark you had your friends over watching the film made you yourself go on an adventure.  Why anyone would give this film anything below a 4 star rating is beyond me.<br /><br />I dont have to tell you the story line of this film because chances are you saw it already if not then you must be somewhere under 27 or 28 because this film was really for the late 20 early 30's individual before surround sound, and HD was even considered as a movie format.  The benefit of Goonies is that it takes you back to when you were a kid and keeps you there.
1400052173|5.0|As a medical professional, I must say this book should be required reading for every professional, particularly researchers,  in the health care profession.

0143114085|4.0|Alice Fancourt, still suffering from the physical consequences of a difficult birth, takes time away from her role as a mother to go on a brief outing. She entrusts the care of Florence, their baby, to her husband David.  But instead of feeling rejuvenated by the short break, Alice becomes hysterical when she returns home and claims that while she was away someone took Florence, leaving another infant in her place. The police are called in, Alice's mother-in-law, who is on vacation, is called back, and the identity of \\"Little Face\\", the baby living in the Fancourt home, is called into question. As the book progresses the solution of an old crime is called into question.<br /><br />Alternating chapters written in the first person from Alice's point of view with chapters written in the third person that detail the police investigation and the personal problems, relationships and peculiarities of the officers assigned to the case, Sophie Hannah creates a psychological thriller that may, even at the end of the novel, leave most readers wondering about the motivations of several characters, including DC Simon Waterhouse and the woman who supervises him, Sergeant Charlie Zailer.<br /><br />Hannah unfolds the plot and the pasts of the characters slowly, creating mounting tension and doubts about what really happened to Florence, as well as to how much the reader can trust perspectives of the characters.  Even the characters doubt themselves and each other, making it easy to misjudge motives, what has happened, and what is happening.<br /><br />It is not difficult to understand why some readers feel plot developments are unfair or the ending is not satisfactory or why some reviewers have felt aspects of the plot were forced or just too clever.  It is true the book requires close reading and the avoidance of assumptions.  It is also true that the book is as much about complexity of character - maybe even more so - than unraveling the crimes in the story.  As for the way the novel concludes, it does leave the reader with the feeling that not every question is answered or every detail explained - pretty much like life.t does leave the reader with the feeling that not every question is answered or every detail explained - pretty much like life.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I have never been into rap, and have varied music tastes ranging from oldies to country. I have always written Eminem off as a gimmick and foul mouth rapper. Recently I got hooked on one of his songs and downloaded his first album. Once I got past the surface, I realized that his lyrics have great depth and must be taken past face value. He is a true artist that has expressed himself in ways that most people will not understand if they cannot get past some of the explicit and violent metaphors he uses. Upon truly understanding his lyrics you realize how much of a genius, albiet an individual that has gone through the depths of hell to raise to the top of the music industry. I have since obtained all his albums and enjoyed them all.     Recovery is one of the absolute, if not best album he has released. I think if most people listened to this album and the lyrics they would have great respect of what he acheived. If you get any Eminem album, this should be it.
0525423842|4.0|I loved the book, and I think my students will also. Those reviewers who think that the school setting is outdated must not have their children in a good private school. Although the school where I teach does not segregate the sexes, teachers and staff all have a personal interest in each and every student. I doubt that many of the students think their classes are boring at my school, but they are each respectful of the students and challenge each student to excellence. Thank you, John Grisham, for portraying a school where people actually learn and care about each other.
B003LXM1RS|5.0|This album has been years in the making... and, boy, is it worth the wait! Playful, sexy, funny, and just outright fabulous, the Sisters have outdone themselves with \\"Night Work\\". In all honesty, there isn't a bad song on this album. The Thriller-esque voiceover provided by Ian McKellen is both sinister and sexy. Ana Matronic's bridge is hilarious. \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" is almost anthemic, and possibly the most commercial track -- I wouldn't be surprised if it winds up a single. The whole disc is like a dazzling celebration of gay life, pre-AIDS. The cover, a photo by Robert Mapplethorpe, is like a wistful memory and a tribute to that lost era.     I love the entire CD -- it has been on continuous play in my car for a week. The beats make me want to get up and dance, and the lyrics are often deeper than they seem upon a first listen.     This is the Scissor Sisters album you MUST have. Get it. Now.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This album is a complete breath of fresh air!  I love the quirky (sometimes slightly morbid) lyrics, and the infectious rhythms.  The Eclipse soundtrack introduced me to Florence, with her song \\"Heavy In Your Arms\\".  It is a wonderfully dark love song, with a heavy rock influence.  I look forward to hearing more from Florence + the Machine!
030726999X|5.0|All three of these books, from an avid Dean Koontz and Iris Johannsen fan, was phenominal reading.  Just picturing the people, following the story and Lisbeth is someone I would have loved to meet in person.  I admire the personality and characteristics that he gave her.  And Blomkvist and Berger - just fun people to follow.  This book introduces Figuerlo (sp) and she even seems like a great person that he profiled.  Just overall - a great series and very depressing to know it is over....
0060290110|5.0|I was so anxious to read this classic to my kids, but they are only 4.5yrs.  The Illustraions are beautiful and kept their attention.  I thought we would read it over several nights but we plowed through it in two nights.  Great for 4-7 year olds.
0525423842|5.0|My son-in-law is a lawyer and an avid John Grisham fan.  This book was a birthday present for him.  As soon as he got it, he immediately began reading! Amazon has the best prices I have found for my purchases of books.  Thank you!
B003ITZBW2|4.0|This was truly the batman cartoon I've been waiting for, for so long.  The story ran smoothly and seamlessly.  I will admit that the first scene Joker's voice was a bit off putting, but it eventually grows on you. Having NPH as Nightwing worked surprisingly well. Jensen Ackles was phenomenal, I can't think of a better person for the part. Animation is also really well done
0307454541|2.0|This book is driving me crazy. I am now on p. 328 of 590 and the main character FINALLY, I mean FINALLY met the OTHER main character, said girl w/dragon tat. Where is the editorial staff when you need it, I ask you? You know, this book shows just how arbitrary success in publishing can be, because this book is long, tedious, and infuriating. It took this guy 120 pages to set up the story. 120 pages! And finally, more than halfway through the entire long, overdrawn story, the most interesting character of all shows up for a starring role. Up until now, she's had half a dozen or so cameo appearances; the main body of the story has been about the other main character trying to solve an old family mystery. It's infuriating. Oh, but now that I've stuck it out for this long, maybe, hopefully, ONE CAN ONLY PRAY, the story will pick up and be worth reading. For crying out loud.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Have both the BBC production & the movie.  Wonderful book brought to life in both versions.    One with an older Elizabeth Bennett & a faithful adaptation of the book.    The other with a young Keira Knightley, some changes to the story, but nonetheless an absolutely stunning movie.      I recommend both versions.
0743566572|4.0|The story is great, but the reader is not what i expected.  I would have preferred a different reader for the audiobook
0385504225|2.0|Reading this book was like watching a high speed chase live, always waiting to see what's next, only to the have an unsatisfied and marginally entertained feeling after it's all done.  Like the other 2 Langdon books,  there's a bad guy who manipulates everyone to accomplish his bidding, which takes everyone through a convoluted web of conspiracy laden history, endless trivia, and cheesy dialogues.  The overuse of codes and symbols is fascinating at first, then just down right cheesy.        Oh well. At least the paperback itself had a nice cover and was delivered early by Amazon.
B0015ABRE2|2.0|I was only able to watch the first 2 episodes in this 3rd season so far, and because of that I'm not overly happy.  I'm sure the season itself is good, as the first 2 were amazing, but due to technical difficulties I can't see the rest of it, and apparently I'm not the only one thats run into problems of this kind with it, so...  The first season played fine on a PS3, but then it'd automatically reset the player if I tried viewing beyond that.  I watched the 2nd episode on my PC, and then the 3rd episode would \\"skip\\" and become pixelated with every other frame or so, same with the 2nd disc when I tried it.  Still anxiously awaiting advice that will allow me to enjoy the rest of the season.
B002ZG97E2|4.0|A fun tale of the number one villain losing his choice position to a young upstart and enrolling three orphan girls to help him.  There are some good flashbacks, among other things, which ties his story to those of the orphans.  In addition, it's good fun and there are lots of villainous gadgets and good to great humorous lines.  The one-eyed gibbering minions steal some of the scenes.  MY GRADE: B plus.
0380725398|4.0|One of duMaurier's best - a rich, romantic, and atmospheric gothic romance - a classic.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|If you love nature, you should purchase these series. It is as if you are there. No need to waste money and go for a holiday when you can be there by watching these series in a good HD/LED TV using Blu Ray!     These series are also very educative. I definately learnt a lot about nature.  The best thing is that these series were also used to educate my children. Now, they do not have to memorise geography! Looked at many movies of 'nature' but nothing is comparable to these.
B003MC5N28|1.0|my class  had to read this book for school. it was a very. . . interesting book filled with death. i would not recomend this book. nobody in my class liked it. it is an unnerving book. it was slow and boring in my opinion.
006145205X|4.0|In this book, acclaimed biologist Matt Ridley argues that real human progress began when people started exchanging stuff, which was anything from goods to food. But the real excitement in our evolution began when humans started exchanging ideas. Ideas spread like viruses and ideas about self-preservation and progress led to the world as we see it today. Ridley's central thesis is that we should have have cause for optimism in the face of our current problems such as overpopulation, nuclear threats and climate change, because the same human mind that has progressed through the give and take of ideas will save us. Ridley's optimism is not always founded in hard data (after all, prediction is always difficult...especially about the future), but at the very least his book provides provocative ideas which at least have the potential to be shaped into the reality of the future, if only we show a little perspective.

B000002O4X|3.0|The music seemed to be much more powerful in the movie, when it was paired with the beautiful images of Africa.  Without the images, it loses its punch.  Now it's just good background music for when you want something quiet and not intrusive.
044654146X|5.0|For lack of time I'm compelled to stick to brevity... as I could surely digress with superlatives readily favorable to the book.  (Let me say, though, that while I'm opting not to say much, I feel compelled to make sure my well-deserved, 5-star rating and subsequent review are herein entered.  The book is absolutely excellent, informative, and eye-opening into Israel's amazing story.  It is not a dull or sluggish read and though informative seems not too preoccupied with an exhaustive slew of facts or any of the other similar typical literary formalities that often beset such works (though I appreciate those as well as this).    I would particularly recommend the book to any interested or involved in economics, political science, business, modern history, or philosophy... and/or any of a host of other various fields.
B003OCWF6I|3.0|I really like this film. but the films that have some problems like the ending which I won't talk about for the people who haven't seen it. But for a good action film and a action film with Zoe Saldana who been in lots of geek films like star trek and avatar and she said that from herself that she is a geek. the only person who I hated in the film and lots people hated him is Max well the guy playing Max is Jason Patric is was really bad. Jeffery Dean Morgan was descent as Clay and Chris Evans is funny as hell Idris Elba is getting better with his America voice and this is a DC Comic series by Andy Diggle and this guy named Jock and this guys are British as well as Idris Elbra and the losers is a good action film until the end so check it out.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|I can't believe the difference changing to this cable made in my TV picture.  I am very happy with it.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This is a great movie. It has subtitles but most of the time the dialogue is sparse enough to read without having to pause. It is a very tender and sensitive movie without being sentimental or maudlin. It elegantly avoided all the pitfalls that ruin so many of this kind movie. It's educational, but I wouldn't hold that against it.

B003J27WFW|5.0|This was a welcome history/documentary of Rush that was both entertaining and informative. I like the part where they talk about Hine producing Presto- I wish he would produce another one of their albums. Nice bonus DVD in which they include some concert footage. My favorite was the song from Counterparts(one of the few songs that I actually like from that album) dedicated to Entwistle. I almost docked a star for the negative portrayal of their mid 80s albums. I loved these albums and I truly believe that Rush was one of the few bands at that time that continued being progressive. Their personalities are certainly revealed. Geddy likes baseball like me so that's cool and he seems to be a down to earth kind of guy.  Alex is funny and Neil's kind of a loner. The movie holds ones interest and is well worth purchasing.
B00003003R|2.0|The pleasure of listening to a live album is that it features a great band delivering spectacular, improvisatory performances that enriches not only audiences in the building but also listeners at home, making them feel like they are a part of the show. Such great examples are THE WHO LIVE AT LEEDS, GET YOUR YA-YA'S OUT and even BULLET IN THE BIBLE. It is with great displeasure, though, to say that GUNS N' ROSES LIVE ERA 87-93 is not one of them. In fact, it is one of the most misconceived and disappointing live records ever made.<br /><br />\\"Nightrain\\" sets the mood of what is wrong with LIVE ERA. The music sounds tight and exciting but there's one problem: the Axl Rose who is singing is not the same Axl Rose that sang it at the time. In other words, Axl sounds like he has re-recorded most of the songs from a nearby booth instead of singing from an actual show. And it's not just Axl; many of the other songs, guitar bits and all, sound polished and slick, as if the remaining members of GNR refurbished some of their own material.<br /><br />For example, \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\", which was taken from the Freddie Mercury concert, sounds more raincoat than the actual version, which rocked harder, even with the fruity keyboards while \\"Rocket Queen\\" is missing a rhythm guitar and is instead replaced by Dizzy Reed's bongos and keyboards. This diminishes the excitement of the album since Guns N' Roses were known to be an exhilarating, self-destructive rock group that, like the Sex Pistols, was always on the verge of exploding on stage. This reviewer has watched many GNR concerts on Youtube and can honestly tell you that 80% of the track list sounds nothing like the actual shows. In fact, the shows themselves sound better.<br /><br />Another problem with LIVE ERA 87-93 is that it is just that: a live era encompassing Guns N' Roses' live performances from 1987-1993. This would have been a good idea if one disc captured GNR from 1985-1990 and another from 1991-1993. But instead, it is jumbled together. One performance from a 1987 show is followed by one from a 1992, and then one from 1991, and then another back to 1992. This creates a distorted overview of a band that was known to give fiery performances and, at the same time, experiment with their own music on each tour they were in. Listening to this album, it is quite obvious that the majority of tracks came from the USE YOUR ILLUSION tour. This begs the question: why couldn't they just release a GNR live record covering the UYI tour instead? It would have made more sense and create a more better live record.<br /><br />That is not to say the songs themselves are not enjoyable. A mediocre GNR song is superior to anything that has happened today and some of the live songs have an ounce of energy. Izzy's grimy, Stones-like \\"Dust N' Bones\\" surpasses the studio version; \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", \\"You're Crazy\\" and \\"Used to Love Her\\" captures GNR at their raw peak more effectively than the other songs; and \\"Move to the City\\" is GNR at their most irresistibly excessive, featuring killer guitar riffs, jazzy pianos and silly horn sections. Not coincidentally, these songs also happen to be ones less polished than the other tracks.<br /><br />As a GNR album, LIVE ERA is an interesting time waster but as a live record, it fails on nearly every level. For a better live document of Guns N' Roses, you'd be well-advised to watch Ritz at 1988, Paris 1992 or Argentina 1993 instead. Messy as they are, they are more enjoyable and exhilarating to sit through than this haphazard compilation.tead, it is jumbled together.

1582701709|1.0|In  sales, training for a job I no longer have, the training manager `treated' me and my colleagues to a movie.  Now, the anticipation of breaking the monotony of a classroom situation with a movie presentation is buried deeply in American students.  The title came up and it was the video version of the best-selling _The Secret_.  I watched this, and diligent student that I am, I took notes.  I had very little conception of just what I was in for.  I knew that it was a highly selling book.<br /><br />The 'Secret', for those out of the know is simple.  All you have to do is ask the universe for stuff and it gives it to you.  I wish that were a gloss of the explanation, but that seems to be it.  If I had my notes from that day, I would most likely see things like `Magical Thinking!' or other such pithy refutations of the main premise of the video as I argued against it as I watched it.  I remember that my main beef with the video was that of the dozen or so speakers advocating the `Secret' that were featured as authors, I had heard of exactly none of them.  If the secret is so powerful, I asked, why are these people not successful enough that I had ever heard of them.  When the lights came up, the trainer asked about our opinions of the video.  I can't remember what I said, but I hope it was positive enough for him.<br /><br />I understand the appeal of the  secret.  People like stuff.  Our capitalistic economy makes you break the tenth commandment all the time.  Happiness is not just related to material accumulation, but happiness is material accumulation.  The advertising and the media assure us that this is the uncritical mindset that people live their lives in.  I have seen people play general positive thinking up in both scholastic and professional life, and I kept wondering about the efficacy of it.  In my opinion staying positive is detrimental to critical thinking and maintaining a realistic and non-exhausting baseline.  The biggest argument against the secret is the last two years.  How many people in 2007 started asking for less stuff?is the last two years.  How many people in 2007 started asking for less stuff?

B002ZG97RE|3.0|This picture gives insight on what really went on in the upper politics of the white house, CIA, and pentagon about all the lies that were constructed to invade Iraq and steal its oil by the republicans/Zionists. It gives insight on who participated in spreading the lies to sell the war back in the US and even the UK. Paul Bremer and his Journalist friend were well represented as they were, so they are easy to distinguish. Apart from the Rambo Style action and the hero who never runs out of wit and ammo, and ends up killing everyone on his own in every language possible.(Keeping the Hero Soldier theme alive) Mat Damon was a good choice for the film. The other nice thing about this film is that for the first time it is finally given out as a fact that the Iraqis had prepared for a Guerilla War in case the defence of the cities was not possible. At least that is what I felt is the case as they never seem to run out of men and ammo for their just cause in freeing their country from the occupation, as any decent nation would do on this planet ! Great Film and very daring in pointing out the corruption that led to the Disaster in Iraq !!!!

0061801313|5.0|we have not read all the books yet, but so far they are pretty good.  the price was great.  now if you would just offer the other books in the series as a box set, i would jump right on that.
B003CN5SAY|2.0|Well here comes, there goes, \\"Nip Tuck\\". After six seasons the production team have moved on to a new and more successful show. It is such a shame that (quite obviously) the team that gave us five funny, crazy, fascinating, ridiculous seasons should opt out so lamely at the end. There is no doubt in my mind that Ryan Murphy and his team were a little distracted when they were putting this season together, and who could blame them. At the same time they were creating the most exciting and successful new TV sensation of the decade. But what \\"Glee\\" has gained, \\"Nip Tuck\\" has sadly lost. This looks like a contractual obligation on everyone's parts, but if the ridiculous hairbrained, repetitious storylines aren't enough, the actors looked positively bored and almost embarassed by it all . I remember in the Australian press Julian McMahon making some sort of critical remark about the last season when he had to return suddenly to tend to his ailing (famous)mother who sadly has since died.<br /> Why didnt they leave it at season five, one of the best seasons of the series. Nothing is new here and the guest (patients)stars seem to dominate. The regular player are bit by bit written out in less than satisfactory ways. Kelly Clarkson's\\"suicide\\" looks like a plot device for her to return in the final episodes, when she doesnt, you ponder in amazement that such a vital character from the series could be written out in such an inappropriate and unbelievable way.<br /><br />I give it two stars only because the wondrous Vanessa Redgrave returns for two episodes and her moments are the best in the series. Joely Richardson, the other reason for making this season almost bearable is also back but only for four episodes out of nineteen. Her exit is contrived and if you want total nonsense see what happens to John Hensley, whose unlikeable character probably deserves what he gets in the end, but it would have been nice if he had been given some positive finale, some sort of learning or redemption. But no, off he goes into another disaster.As to the two central characters, well, I wouldnt have minded if \\"sean\\" had jumped off a boat in the first episode, Julian remains the most developed character, but clearly is out the door long before the final credits. The series has outstayed its welcome and best for us to remember the good times, of which this season certainly is not. !!.

0785126708|3.0|I don't know what I was expecting from a Hulk event but I wanted more from this.  It was a huge slugfest that was one note and makes everyone else besides the Hulk look terrible.  The supporting cast, Hulk's Warbound, don't play a large enough roll.  John Romita Jr.'s art, which I usually love felt rushed and was lackluster.  The coloring on the book was awful.  This book was nothing more than 100+ pages of Hulk beating up heroes which seems like every 12 year old Hulk fan's dream.  As an old man (32) it left me wanting more.

0553381687|3.0|There seems to be a great deal of debate as to whether or not this is a good book/series.  I'm not going to jump in with the rest of the crowd and write a review that bashes the other reviews (come on people), but as a well-read fantasy enthusiast and author, I would like to give my impressions of the book to potential readers.  I'll begin by saying what I liked about the book.<br /><br />Let me first start off by saying that I did indeed enjoy this book, and I went on to read the next three.  The characters are very interesting and well developed, and the story is full of twists and turns.  One of the key selling points for this book is that it breaks from the traditional \\"good vs. evil\\" fantasy saga.  The story is fitting for the title, and you'll probably find yourself rooting for different \\"players of the game\\" throughout the course of the story.  Martin has managed to successfully merge traditional fantasy with a modern realpolitik novel.  His dramatization of the action is very compelling and will have the reader turning the page and staying up later and later to finish one more chapter.  His details of medieval warfare, weaponry, and politics also seem to be very well researched.<br /><br />There are numerous negative points to this book (and series), however, which cause this book not to be my first choice of fantasy to recommend.  First of all, the story is only marginally constructed and is quite poorly organized.  The characters, dialogue, and action are all excellent, but the plot is extremely convoluted.  The book also includes profanity that serves absolutely no literary purpose (and that is not to sound prudish; it's not the profanity I have a problem with - it's Martin's way of using it just for the sake of using it).  I think what truly compels me to recommend against this book, however, is the fact that Martin is very irresponsible as an author.  This was a decent book; by itself, it's a good read.  However, Martin began a four-book series which remains unfinished - he had promised that book five would be released in 2005.  It's now 2010 and we're still waiting for it.  Honestly speaking, I have read so much other good fantasy since then (like [[ASIN:0812538366 The Wheel of Time (Boxed Set #1)]] and [[ASIN:0812575482 Through Wolf's Eyes (Wolf, Book 1)]]) that I'm not sure I'll even read book five if it ever comes out.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - this book is a great book for killing an hour or two on a winter evening, but it certainly falls short of fantasy greats like J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert Jordan.  Even if you're looking for a fantasy that breaks from tradition, this is not the best read.  For that, you're better off with a series like [[ASIN:076536543X Mistborn Trilogy Boxed Set]].

B001ER4CSO|5.0|The quality of this film is very high, and it is rare a sequel will triumph over its predecessor.  This film does more than triumph.  The incredible detail in all the creatures, the story, it all wraps you in, and is a thrill ride worth taking.
B003ELOQCK|5.0|Wonderful DVD to add to your U2 collection. There are some very special moments that sneak up on you. Look for Bono forgetting a word in Wild Horses & just throwing in a rhyme that surprises him & he just chuckles at himself. Special moments between band members that are touching. U2 does rock & this DVD proves this. They just keep evolving & better themselves. You will love this DVD !
B000W0TJQE|4.0|I like the direction Frank Herbert took the Dune series in his first two sequels. This book has a bit more development than the original Dune. We get to learn more about the inner turmoil of Paul, Alia, and then meet the kids. Frank has a way of creating politically exciting twists and power struggles, without making any one character the villain. Paul and Alia in their own ways are both despots and victims. In terms of storyline, I think this brings the story to a satisfying conclusion (I'm not so big a fan of what happens after [[ASIN:0441104029 Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)]]).    Frank's writing style can be a bit dense. Sometimes the dialogue is filled with philosophical or nonsensical musings. Some of it is quite deep - but certainly not how people actually talk. It takes some getting used to. I'd recommend only continuing on to this book if you got through the original Dune and liked it.    If you liked the books, I highly recommend [[ASIN:B00008RUYH Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (Sci-Fi TV Miniseries) (Two-Disc DVD Set)]] - it's a pretty good film adaptation of [[ASIN:0441015611 Dune Messiah (Dune Chronicles)]] and [[ASIN:0441104029 Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)]].

B00337KM2S|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed watching Up in the Air. I was a bit worried this would turn into a typical Hollywood movie bashing corporations and celebrating \\"family values,\\" but it's much more subtle. It's much deeper than I thought (certainly much more so than a typical George Clooney movie). Vera Farmiga and George Clooney add a lot of emotional complexity and are a joy to watch. My only disappointment was with Anna Kendrick - her acting was basically mechanical and forced. I'd definitely recommend checking this movie out.

B003OCWF6I|3.0|The film adaptation of Andy Diggle and Jock's Vertigo comic The Losers is a breezy, fun, flashy, and entertaining action flick, and not much else other than that.  The Losers follows a team of special forces ops (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Idris Elba, Columbus Short, Oscar Jaenada, and future Captain America Chris Evans) who are looking to get revenge on the evil mastermind (Jason Patric) who betrayed them and wants them dead.  Even with a mysterious new partner (Zoe Saldana) by their side, things don't look to go too well for anyone involved.  At its core, The Losers is fun enough with solid work from Morgan, Saldana, Evans, and Patric especially, though whether or not you're a fan of the comic or not, you'll still find it to be mindless flashy mainstream action that surprisingly pushes the limits of its PG-13 rating.  Still, there are much worse comic book adaptations that you could waste your time on, so in the end, The Losers isn't too bad and a step above being mediocre.  In that respect alone, it's worth checking out.

I really don't understand how reviewers can say this is one of the best books they've read in years. There were definitely parts that dragged on. I didn't find this a particularly easy or fun read. Not horrible, it was OK.

B000002HJA|4.0|I'm not so sure why, but to me, Circus just doesn't stand up to Kyuss' earlier efforts.  I've listened to it again and again and again and there just are not enough songs that stand out to me.  \\"One Inch Man\\" is the only song on this album worthy of including in a Kyuss' Greatest Hits album. \\"Hurricane\\" is great and the rest of the album is by no means bad.  I think this album lacks some of the awesome raw garage sound that is a staple of their earlier albums.    Kyuss fans will want this album, because this band rules.  But if you're new to Kyuss, I'd recommend you start with Blues for the Red Sun or Sky Valley.

B00006AG5N|5.0|All the king of rock n rolls number one hit songs from the U.S. and U.K., or I should say 30, since he probably had more number ones in those countries than that. All his big songs like Jailhouse Rock, Hound Dog, and Return to Sender are here, and we get them in pretty crisp and clean quality. From what I am aware, not all the songs are the original recording versions, but I can forgive this, since Elvis always sang his best, whether he was performing live or for a record. Elvis still is the king of rock n roll, and you can see why by listening to all these greatest hits. And the remix of a Little Less Conversation is amazing. One of the best tributes to the king that I've heard.
0385736002|5.0|Twin 15-year-old siblings Sophie and Josh Newman meets Nick Fleming, actually Nicholas Flamel, a 14th-century alchemist who can turn metal into gold.  From the get-go, the book is full of action that takes the twins across the world, meeting werewolves and vampires, fighting evil in order to save the world.  Preteens to adults will enjoy this action adventure with an intriguing premise.  Pacing is just right and the characters (although not as in-depth as other young adult characters) are likable and engaging.  I will be reading the next books in this series.
0374531269|5.0|I wanted to read this novel for quite some time, and when I finally got to it I was not disappointed.  Though rather short, \\"A Long Way Gone\\" is to the point and powerful, educational and thought-provoking.<br /><br />\\"A Long Way Gone\\" is a memoir, written by Ishmael Beah, a young man from Sierra Leone who brought the savage civil war in his country to the forefront in his stirring recollection.  Personally I was aware of many different regional conflicts (Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwanda, to name a few), but I was utterly unfamiliar with the war in Sierra Leone.  Seeing it through the eyes of a boy who was caught up in the fighting taught me more than a dry history book would have.<br /><br />Ishmael was not even a teen when fighting in his country erupted.  Forced to flee his area due to rebels invading his area, Ishmael is separated from his family and forced to walk across the country in hopes of escaping the conflict.  The rebels were infamous for killing indiscriminately, while at the same time kidnapping boys in order to have them fight against government forces.  Those that refused lost their lives.  Ishmael was not a fighter, trying to survive the madness his country was enveloped in.  Even so, when he stumbled upon government forces, Ishmael was forced to join.  He was introduced to weapons and desensitizing drugs, which helped him kill.  Thanks to a responsible officer, Ishmael was sent to the capital city in order to be reunited with the only family he had left: his uncle, and in order to be \\"reprogrammed\\" so he could be a kid again.<br /><br />Although written with an objective undertone, with absolutely no self-pity, the reader can still see and feel everything the author went through, which I find to be an excellent accomplishment.  The reader is allowed to make his/her own decisions about the conflict presented with an experience of a child.  Succint prose, vivid (though not flowery) descriptions, and precise presentation of information, all contributed to an easy, yet informational read that was powerful and educational.<br /><br />I would highly recommend \\"A Long Way Gone\\" to all who are unfamiliar with the Sierra Leone conflict, and with the conflicts in that area in general.  Many a time we get lulled by our own security, not realizing what goes on in the world around us.  This novel showed what people are capable of doing when they fight to survive, even in our own, modern time.  And that brings a sort of an awakening; realizing the differences in fortunes, a reader can hardly stay indifferent.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />*** Also published on Epinions
B003C1QIO6|1.0|I've tried getting into this guy. I used think that I could get used a boring guy that sounded like a cross between Phish, Jimmy Buffett and Jason Mraz, but after trying for awhile I just can't do it. I don't like Curious George that much either. I think he's a stupid animal. I listened to the curious george thing and his last CD because the supermodel looking girl I was dating at the time liked it. We had an agreement, I could play playstation three and roller skate in the kitchen whenever I wanted and she could listen to Jack Johnson on the home stereo. That was a mistake. I got so angry that I chased our cat, Gooberwonkles, around the house with an ice cream scoop. I shouldn't be doing that when a mellow CD is on. I really shouldn't be doing that period, but I really didn't like what I was hearing.     We ended up breaking up because I met someone hotter, but guess what? She wanted to listen to this in the car on our first date. I agreed because, ya know, but I ended up falling asleep and crushing her doghouse. I'm glad the dog wasn't in it, but it was truly a lesson on how dangerously bad this CD can be.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|I've always loved the original Sinatra/Jobim album and wanted more. I knew there was another album that never saw the light of day, so I was thrilled when I heard about this project to release it. The new songs are almost on par with the old ones, and I suspect that after listening to the a couple of hundred more time they will blend it perfectly with the rest. Sinatra's voice is in excellent condition and perfectly suited for Jobim's creations.
B000UCI5WS|5.0|Most literary snobs won't touch this book because it is classified as fantasy, but I think it is more historical fiction with some minor horror and couple of Dragons thrown in.  There are so many characters that he brings to life to life with unique complex personalities and faults.  So far, I like this series better than any other.  I wish he would dare to put out the final two volumes.  He is such a perfectionist.  He needs to learn a lesson from Steven King and just do it.  I wish Steven King would write more like GRRM though.
1423101499|3.0|The Battle of the Labyrinth involves Percy battling with a selection of Greek monsters. The first battle that Percy has is with two creatures called 'Empousai'. The two empousai (vampires) dress as high school cheerleaders and attack Percy and his new friend, Rachel Dare.  The next battle is with a Sphinx. The third  battle in the book is between Percy and Nemesis' son. They fight for hours until...well I can't say too much (but lets face it we know he survives because Book 5 follows on!).
B001E75QH0|5.0|Great edition, with the four Indiana Jones movies, with introductions of George Lucas & Steven Spielberg in every movie. With Spanish subtitles in all movies including the extras. To complete the collection only need the extra DVD of the first three movies.
B000Y1ZXUM|1.0|I have a brand new higher end home theater system. I watched the blu Ray disc last night. I am not a fan of Shakira in fact I have never heard or seen her work. I am also 58 so this may be a generational thing. However I love concert videos and have a large collection spanning several genres. I also love Latin singers. In addition I am an avid concert goer. My main disappointment was with the audio recording of this disc. Don't get me wrong. The music was crystal clear. It was just that it was hard to hear Shakira. Her voice seemed to blend in with the music in a way that it was difficult to hear what she was singing. I tried the various sound stages on my pioneer receiver however no luck. I stopped watching the disc because I was disappointed. I so much wanted to and was expecting to enjoy this one. If anyone has a suggestion of another disc of hers that I can watch where her voice is more distinct I would like to give it a try.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This clasic movie is one of my favourites, when I was 10 years old was the first time that I've watched this movie, only with Spanish voices without subtitles on English on the songs. This edition came with two DVDs, one is the movie with Spanish subtitles, the other one the extras, very interestings, sadly only on English without subtitles, but If you know something of English you can understand it.

0515142247|2.0|My first impression found no first person narrative, which I enjoyed in the first novel.  The over use of \\"right?\\" and the shrugging made everyone seem like they had the same \\"acting coach.\\"  The FBI guys were interchangable for the first 3/4 of the book, and the female lead was fantastically annoying.  In short, there was way too much \\"everyone else\\" and too little Reacher.  Certain high tension moments in the book were totally unbelieveable (lasers from the sky ruse, and the gun to the chest).  I really enjoyed the first book but found this story a severe disappointment.

0812548094|3.0|I really like Stone of Tears; the plot and situations facing Richard and Kahlan are very unique and creative. Let me go ahead and say right now, that I don't think this is a bad book, but a couple of things got under my skin:<br /><br />1) Too much recap. I know Goodkind (or his editor) was probably not thinking too much for his future readers. What he (or they) had in mind was making sure his fans would be reminded what happened in Wizard's First Rule and could therefore grab it hot off the presses on its release date. But for someone like me (who, 15 years later, bought the boxed set and could immediately jump to the next book) that much recap was useless and frustrating.<br /><br /> 2)Repetition of certain concepts. I don't know what the problem was but it seemed Goodkind felt his readers couldn't remember basic facts about Kahlan or Richard. I was reminded in almost every chapter focusing on Kahlan that she was THE Mother Confessor and it was HER responsibility to watch over the little people of the Midlands. I GET IT! I remembered that just fine from WFR. Thankfully, around halfway through the book, Goodkind must've felt it was hammered in well enough and moved on to telling the story. It also seems that Richard can't even touch the Sword of Truth without Goodkind throwing in that Richard \\"felt the word 'Truth' on the hilt digging into his palm\\". Cut the drama of useless detail and get on with it.<br /><br />3) Way too much sap. And this is bad coming from a chick. I know, I know, \\"but they discovered they could love each other and not hide their feelings\\" blah, blah. Instead of condensing this into one or two effective, touching and poignant scenes, this drags on with every chapter Rich and Kahlan are together until they're separated, which is when I took a sigh of relief. I needed them to have some time apart!<br /><br />4) Characters talking to each other as if they're stupid. This happened a handful of times between Zedd and Adie; Zedd is a wizard, Adie, a sorceress. There should be at least a base of common knowledge between the two. The best analogy I can make is to pretend that they both have Ph.Ds in physics, but one is telling the other how Newton formulated his theory of gravity, or explaining how sub-atomic particles work. That should not happen, ever! Goodkind should've thought of better ways to teach his readers this system of magic besides dialogue, especially between the two most skilled wizards of the story (so far) after Darken Rahl. It was forced, fake and boring.<br /><br />Again, this is NOT a bad story, it was bad editing. I recommend reading it, but be aware of the crap you're gonna have to skirt around to finish it.t least a base of common knowledge between the two.

Its pretty much compatible with every one of my strollers (all single strollers)It is sturdy and holds up great with 2 coffees on the sides and wallet, phone and keys in the middle.

But that was an easy fix!

6302752337|5.0|I knew of this movie since I was A Kid and I Am A Motorcycle Fan but I found this movie Not to be as great as I thought It would be, because Its Not very realistic (As an up-date actually I Am being foolish to say this movie Is Not realistic actually this movie Is ahead of Its time, I do Not know what to call them Some call them rednecks but then Jeff Foxworthy make Them to be a back woods Country Folks as Myself, Some call them pharisees but what ever they are called they are murderers looking for an excuse to murder and We know what happened when one was elected president with the help of false Prophets If You Google 911 Blueprint for truth) even though Oklahoma has Its fair share of lying slime politicians but still yet I have never heard of Anyone getting shot for having long hair but that could be because I Am The Meek and I Know what Meek means and I shoot back, but this movie Is entertaining. I see Hollywood Is on here trying to get People to buy expensive Blu Ray and yes I have a Playstation 3 and seen how they make a picture look burly to trick You Into buying something more expensive. Hollywood are thieves they do everything to keep high resolution recording equipment out of the hands of Artist as Me, I mean come on Hollywood do Not have talent any more then they try to sell the movies on Blu Ray LOL. When Hollywood says High Definition what they mean Is HD for digital standards because Analog and CRT already was high resolution especially S-VHS and film Is even higher resolution. I bought this movie on VHS used and I Am very pleased with It.
B000088E6D|2.0|I was very disappointed at this CD. I had heard Buble on TV only on one or two songs, then I bought the CD. To me it seems quite over-produced or gimick-y. Based on this, I do not see much reason to liken Buble to Sinatra, beyond the obvious similarity of music sung.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Chihiro is a \\"typical\\" pre-teen that is moving with her parents to a new town. After taking some short cut they find a tunnel where \\"the wind is blowing in\\". The first thing that I noticed is that Chihiro doesn't want to go trough, but her parents have no problem going inside. They eventually find a deserted town alla Japan circa 1800's that only has restaurants. They find one with lots of food and her parents eat and eat. Again, Chihiro doesn't want to try the food. Everything happens with beautiful ambiance and incidental music by Joe Hisaishi.   Chihiro wonders off and realizes that this town only comes to life at night. A boat arrives with lots of wonderful characters. This also caught my attention. The character design is completely original. This is a clear example of the cultural differences preset in the general direction of Miyazaki. For instance, look at Yubaba, the sorceress that owns the bath house that serves nearly \\"8 million gods\\". We all know that this design could hardly be ever approved in a American made animated film.    During this part Chihiro is always afraid until she meets Haku, a 13 year old or so boy that takes her inside the bath house. Haku tells Chihiro to ask Kamaji, an old man with six long arms, for work. Kamaji operates the baths furnace. Kamaji does not have work for her and sends her to Yubaba. In Yubaba's office she meets three green-bald-bearded-bouncing heads. She signs a contract to work for Yubaba as a servant in the bath house and Yubaba literally takes her name and calls her Sen. To me this is a reflection on how one's profession sometimes takes hold of us. With her new job, Sen learns responsability and gains independence.    On night a Stink God arrives to the baths. He brings his eye-opening hair-raising stink along and it's Sen's responsability to lead him in. She learns that it's not the stink outside what counts, but the junk inside, figuratively and literally speaking.    More things happen. There's more characters and situations I won't mention here just in case you have not seen the movie yet. By the end of her journey Chihiro has changed. You can see it in her face. To me the whole experience is a look into her past, present and future life.
B003FK8V7G|5.0|American Slang is a great record by a great band.<br />In no way is it disappointing at all when compared to The Gaslight Anthem's previous two albums.<br />American Slang has much in common with Sink or Swim and The 59 Sound; nothing dramatically different musically or lyrically. This is a good thing though, because The Gaslight Anthem really hit the spot with their style and are as close to perfect as they can get.<br /><br />Maybe I haven't listened to American Slang enough, but the only non-positive comment I have about this album is that there are no songs that really stick out. I haven't found a single song that is just perfect on this album like Film Noir and Ida Called You Woody, Joe.<br /><br />Overall, American Slang is a great album. I would definitely recommend it.<br />If American Slang was the first thing you heard from The Gaslight Anthem, I would definitely check out Sink or Swim and The 59 Sound, both slightly better albums I think.

B002ZG980U|2.0|Admittedly, I am not a big sci-fi fan to begin with, so perhaps I was doomed to dislike this movie from the start. I had high hopes for \\"Inception\\" because everyone I know who saw it absolutely loved it, but it just didn't do anything for me. It reminded me of a slightly improved \\"Matrix\\" (which I absolutely hated). \\"Inception\\" is more thought-out, with good acting, a fantastic score, and impressive visual effects. However, I thought the plot itself was kind of lame, to be quite honest. Perhaps my biggest complaint is that it is WAY too long (almost three hours). I also felt that it was somewhat predictable, because within the first 20 minutes or so, I had an idea of how the film would end, and I was totally right, so there was no big surprise for me when the final scene rolled around. Some of the dream sequences got a little too crazy, and for a while the movie turned into an action flick when everyone started shooting at each other during the snowy mountain sequence. That detracted from the rest of the film. I think I would have enjoyed it more if Marion Cotillard had a bit more screen time, because the scenes she shared with Leonardo DiCaprio were the most interesting and enjoyable for me. I appreciate the creativity behind this film, and I can understand why other people like it as much as they do, but it's just not my cup of tea.
B001FB55L2|1.0|The worse movie Ive seen in a while.  The casting was completely wrong, there was absolutly no chemistry between any of the actors.  The only believable character in the whole movie was the father in law.      Toby Maguire; a Captain in the Military??  oh please, He looked like a 18 year old boot camp recruit and acted like it.  The movie dragged on and on and on but rushed on other parts and that was due to very bad editing. This was probably a good book but certainly did not play well on camera.
B003ES5JE2|4.0|I'm glad that this short is getting such rave reviews. My question is what is the Amazon-exclusive full-color animation 3\\" x 5\\" litho cel that is excluded as an extra? Is it really a cel used in the production of the movie...or  just a re-creation a cel used as a gimmick to trick buyers into spending $3 more than the regular Blue-Ray version of the DVD? Answers please?<br />  I would like to second the request an earlier reviewer suggested that DC has to make their animated films longer if they are going to make the experience truly satisfying for the many older-fans who are buying them. I realize that the excuse they may offer is that kids have too short an attention fan for a 2-hr cartoon, but I suspect that the real reason is that it's just cheaper to make a short film than a full-length one....and yet they still get to charge the same prices! You can full some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time but......

006112429X|5.0|An avid reader friend recommended this book and I'm thankful she did. Kevin is the nightmare child I wouldn't wish on anyone.  He's incredibly intelligent and his actions deliberate but he's also disturbed and sadistic. His mom, as well as this reader, grows to fear him, yet the dad doesn't seem to really see him for who he is.  It's interesting to ask readers when they've finished the book which parent they felt was a more sympathetic character, a more honest parent -- and I vote for the mom.  But the book is very polarizing--Shriver did an incredible job of drawing complete characters and letting the reader come to their own conclusion.<br /><br />Rather than give any of the plot away, I'll just say that the story gets better and better as you go along.  If you have time to read only one book this summer, pluck this off the shelf.<br /><br />Marie Estorge<br />author of CONFESSIONS OF A BI-POLAR MARDI GRAS QUEEN<br />and STORKBITES: A MEMOIR<br />[...].
B002IVLH60|1.0|Clocking in at just 25 minutes, the latest Pearl Jam tape has more in common with [[ASIN:B00005QGAZ Thriller]] than epic Who. What was Eddie Vedder thinking, and who is his manager? Where once these guys ruled Rome, now they're being fed to the lions by the rulers of Target and Venture (a store made popular by 1980s fashion, for those that don't know). But hey, Ed Vedder still has a pretty decent growl when he can rouse himself out of bed on a sunny Seattle morning by the sea.     Has anybody seen Chris Cornell or the dude from The Cars? Maybe they could set things right.     Peace, my bros and broettes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B0029QRA1U|3.0|This record player sounds great, works great, but I was pissed about two things. First of all, while you can play the record player through your computer, it cannot actually record the songs if you have a mac. It acts like it is, but then the files don't play and I had to research online to find out that the software is not mac compatible. Second, if you're running it through a stereo system you have to plug it into the audio input, NOT the phono input. I could have saved a lot of time and hassle if they had just explained those two things in their instructions. Hopefully this will help other people!

B000002LCX|4.0|I could go on and on about how and the conditions which the album was recorded, but that's irrelevant here. After all this is an album review and not a history lesson.<br /><br />In a dizzying run of singles and albums, The Smiths called it a day with this final release. Probably the most cohesive of all Smiths album as the songs just carried the same vibe throughout.<br /><br />\\"Stop Me...\\" is the most commercially recognized song from the album, but there are other gems, such as \\"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me\\", \\"Paint A Vulgar Picture\\" (sadly foretold the fate of any artist(s) or band that either has died or disbanded and gets repackaged (Beatles, Led Zepplin anyone?), \\"I Won't Share You\\" and my personal favorite \\"Rush And A Push And The Land Is Ours.\\"<br /><br />To casual fans, this is a good album to get acquainted with the band.
B001AQR39O|4.0|I was a big fan of the first season of Showtime's raunchy yet surprisingly heartfelt series about the mishaps of gifted but wounded author Hank Moody, but I was suprised at how much better the second season turned out to be.  The action picks up where things ended with the season one finale.  Karen had left her groom-to-be at the altar and jumped in Hank's car instructing him to keep going before she changed her mind.  And so, the second season opens with Hank, Karen and their teenage daughter, Becca, together again and Hank devoted to making things work this time around.<br /><br />But this is Hank we're talking about, and it doesn't take him long to mess up (albiet accidentally) and the same familiar cycle begins again.  When Karen turns down his marriage proposal, Hank leaves and takes up residence with music producer/man child, Lew Ashby whose biography he is writing.  Ashby shares many traits with Hank, including being haunted by \\"the one that got away\\", a woman that Lew sacraficed in exchange for his fast paced lifestyle.  He and Hank form a bond out of their shared loneliness and self-destructive behaviors that gives season 2 even more of a bruised heart feel than the first.<br /><br />Despite the empty place in Hank's heart, and his efforts to change his patterns of behavior, this season is no mere naval gaving mope fest.  Several other plots percolate around our anti-hero.  Becca begins dating, Charlie is fired from his job and becomes involved with an aspiring porn star, his wife succombs to her cocaine addiction again and Hank tracks down the love of Lew's life all while facing the possiblity that he may be a father; and no, Karen is not the mother.  All of these plot threads weave together for a hilarious and moving examination of broken hearts and unrealized dreams.  Plus it's even raunchier than the first season, which is saying a lot.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, Californication is not just about sex, drugs and fast times.  It is a study of how people use these very things to fill in the empty places left by heartbreak and disappointment. The fact that it is able to convey these things while at the same time being enormously funny and entertaining makes it one of the best shows on tv right now.things to fill in the empty places left by heartbreak and disappointment.

0307386171|3.0|The concept of this story is interesting, but I felt like I was trudging through mud to get through it. I like a story that keeps me captivated and I read to be entertained and informed. This book, like Atonement, has so much description that, in my opinion, it detracts from the flow of the story. The entire book takes place in less than a single day, if that helps explain what I mean about a lot of description and detail. That being said, however, it does offer a compelling insight into the human psyche. McEwan explores the depths (literally every step from the surface to the bottom) of the human mind and the feelings, fears and thoughts associated with \\"the\\" honeymoon night of a newlywed couple.    So depending on what you are looking for, you may or may not enjoy this book. If you want a great story, stay away, especially if you are looking for romance. If you are looking for pyschological stimulation and more artistic prose, this may be the book for you. I would say this book is interesting, just not really entertaining.

B002BU0DPE|4.0|You cannot imagine how much it improves your gaming experience until you try them. I like FPS, but I don't actually play them that often. I wear this headset for any game that has directional sound. They are phenomenal for Red Dead Redemption. If there are gunshots in the distance or there is a snake or other animal making noise or stalking me, I can easily pinpoint the exact direction and distance of the sound. The game I play online the most is Uncharted 2 and they are very helpful. Any time an enemy shouts &#34;Over there!&#34; I can take 'em out before they even see me. I recommended this headset to a friend and she absolutely loves it as well. Some people complain about the &#34;hiss&#34;, but it's seriously ridiculous that people are even complaining about that. When you turn on your PS3 and there is NO sound, yes, you will hear it. When you're gaming and have sound or music coming through, that &#34;hiss&#34; is 100% inaudible. It's never been an issue and never will be an issue.<br />If this headset ever wears out, I'll buy another one without thinking twice about it. This is the best $70 I have ever spent.<br /><br />Update 3/03/2015: Removed 1 star. It's been a while since I upgraded to the PX4, but I thought I should update this review. I still believe that the P11's are a good, budget headset. They never crapped out like my PX21's did and the sound quality is excellent for the money. The reason I lowered my rating to 4 stars is long-term comfort; Mainly, I'm referring to the padding in the band that rests on top of your head. It's pretty lousy. Fine at first, but after months or 1-2 years of use, it will get pretty stiff. It now feels like a piece of cardboard wrapped in cheap, faux leather, and there is an indentation from where it rested on my head. I thought about cutting the padding off and fabricating some at home, with a nice foam and wrap it in a breathable piece of cloth, but I wanted a new headset when I got my PS4 anyway and I opted for the PX4 headset instead, which is far superior to the P11 (naturally, it costs more).d, which is far superior to the P11 (naturally, it costs more).
0802130208|5.0|I've read about this book for years. I've probably stood in a bookstore and read the forward (by Walker Percy) half a dozen times. Finally, a copy came my way in a used bookstore, and it was cheap enough that I felt I shouldn't resist. Turns out I was right, and I could have spent a lot more money without wasting it.    Ignatius J. Reilly, the main character of this outrageous masterpiece, is something unique to me in literature. I'm struck how in his own way he's similar to Holden Caufield, the protagonist of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\". Both are completely alienated from society around them, both completely misunderstand their surroundings and the world they live in, and both have a rather perverse view of life and what they want out of it. Reilly, though, is older, has a college degree (you wonder how he got it) and a more formed, if twisted, view of life. He won't ride in the front passenger seat of a car (because it's a \\"deathtrap\\"), is terrified of Greyhound Scenicruisers (once spent a trip to Baton Rouge in one, sick out of his mind), and is a history major who against all the evidence believes that the advent of the Reformation and the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment afterwords, were the beginning of the downfall of World society. He actually wants to start a Divine Right political party, so that someone can be crowned hereditary and unlimited ruler of America. He habitually drinks Dr. Nut, an amaretto-flavored soft drink available in New Orleans (where all this takes place) in the sixties. He blunders through life, bellowing strange pronouncements in a weirdly dignified, pompous voice that is somehow charming and bewildering at the same time. He's definitely an original.    The book's plot consists of him careening through the city of New Orleans, having been expelled from home by his mother, who insists he get a job. What makes the novel interesting is that while no one else Ignatius encounters is really up to his level of weirdness, no one is completely normal, either. Everyone has some sort of misconception or screw-up in their make-up, and Ignatius seems to bring out their weirdness, emphasizing it. When he gets a job in the office of a factory, we meet several people in the office who he works with. So one character never realizes Ignatius is male, and refers to him by the name of a former female coworker. Another thinks a woman working for her would \\"go to pieces\\" if she retired, so (against the woman's wishes) she keeps making her go to work, with comical consequences. Ignatius' mother has troubles of her own, a boyfriend who's a bit of a problem because he sees communists everywhere, a friend with a son who's a policeman, and who tried to arrest the commie-hunter, and so forth. At one point you watch a stripper with a weird act involving a bird, but her act goes horribly wrong in a comical fashion. At another point Ignatius is trying to form a political party exclusively of gays, believing that since they're so habitually neat they'll outlaw warfare. When the lesbians show up and break up the party things get really funny.    I have to confess I'm confused why he had trouble getting this thing published. Interestingly, I read somewhere on the net that Robert Gottlieb was involved in working with Toole on the book at one point, and encouraged him, but didn't think it was publishable in its current state. Gottlieb's a good editor, though I suspect he must have been pretty young at the time. Even so, it must be jarring to him now to realize that this book is as good as it is--it won the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for fiction--even though he apparently thought it needed more work.    Regardless, I would recommend this book highly, especially to anyone with a sense of humor.
B003JTHSE0|5.0|Excellent book!  I was a little hesistant about reading this book at first but because it was our book of the month selection for our book club...I decided to go through with it.  Can you say AWESOME!  I really did judge this book by it's cover initially.  I thought a book about an Indian boy.  Hmm would I have any interest?  Would the story be current?  Would it be a page turner and have me focused?  Answer: All of the above!  Slumdog Millionaire is the story of a boy that actually won the million dollars based on giving answers (to the tv show) that related to his own life.  Very funny. Very witty.  A must read:-)
B003102JDM|5.0|A good man cannot be harmed . . . - Socrates    But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. - Jesus Christ    There are two ways to be a serious man in the manner in which the term is understood in this movie. One way is to be recognized by society as the kind of man who can reward his friends and punish his enemies, a man of consequence, a man to be taken seriously. The other way is to be in full possession of your soul. The eponymous hero of this movie, Larry Gopnik (a physics professor played with great skill by Michael Stuhlbarg) is of the second type. To the eyes of the world, he is a timid man of little consequence. But God, who sees all things, knows otherwise and sends him sorrows so that his soul might bear fruit.     His wife leaves him for another man who, while pretending to be his friend, is secretly conspiring to get Larry denied tenure at his college. One of his students tries to bribe him into giving him a passing grade and when Larry refuses, threatens a lawsuit. His troglodyte neighbor bullies him. His teenage children, being teenage children, can see his predicament and yet are too wrapped up in their own petty concerns to give him the affection and companionship he needs. In desperation, Larry seeks out, in succession, the advise of three Rabbais. The first two try their best to help. The last, the wise Marshak who understands what is going on, offers silence.     What does Larry do? Instead of striking back, he simply absorbs the insults and cruelty. When his wife and her lover suggest he move out of his own house to a seedy motel, he quietly complies. He carries on with each situation by ascertaining the most civil, the most considerate response until, at the end of the film, things turn around and each burden resolves to a tolerably good conclusion, seemingly by itself. Mysteriously, God laid these burdens on Larry and, just as mysteriously, He lifted them. It was all fora purpose. The burdens could have been born with such grace only by a serious man. The trial is over.
0783240287|4.0|I bought this to replace the old VHS tape that had deteriorated beyond repair. It filled the bill nicely. I have had no problems with the sound that some other reviewers have noted. Mine played fine through my home theater system.   As far as content, it's a movie adaptation of a theatrical production. That means it's not going to be exactly like the stage version. In fact, in viewing the \\"bonus content\\", it appears that parts can be swapped or omitted to suit the needs of the actors or audience when put on by a school or amature acting company. Kind of like Handel's \\"The Messiah\\".  Is it a true representation of the Joseph story from the Bible? No. Does it change the plot in several ways? Yes. Is it a worthwhile production? Yes. It is fun and mostly maintains the essential themes from the Bible story. We have enjoyed this movie for a long time and would still recommend it. I give it 4 stars because in my opinion there is no such thing as a perfect 5 star movie.
B001JJBO74|1.0|I am always interested in trying out new fragrances so i was really looking forward to reading this book. Alas, i was destined to be dissapointed.

006145205X|4.0|The author, Matt Ridley, has written an excellent book that is epic in the scope of issues he tackles.  The book covers why homo sapiens thrived while other members of the homo genus fail.  He shows that on average the human condition has gotten consistently better and this increase in wealth has been especially true in the last 200 years.  He destroys the noble savage myth.  He shows the intellectual failings of Marxism, environmentalism, self sufficiency, and renewable energy.  His two main themes underlying these vast topics are: 1) trade leads to division of labor, which leads to invention and 2) the inexorable march of human progress.<br /><br />Despite Mr. Ridley's incredible breadth of knowledge, there is a logical gap in his first thesis when he attempts to explain the industrial revolution and why it took off in England.  This logical gap is the result of his misunderstanding of intellectual property.<br /> This misunderstanding of intellectual property is most likely due to his open source utopianism.  This utopianism leads the book to conclude \\"Thanks to the internet, each is giving according to his ability to each according to his needs, to a degree that never happen in Marxism.\\" P. 356.  Even with this imperfection, this is an incredible book that I highly recommend to anyone.<br /><br />Population Density - Good or Bad for Wealth Creation?<br />The book argues that population density is necessary for trade and division of labor, which is the route to economic prosperity.  It also argues that the division of labor leads to inventions, which leads to further specialization.  Specialization requires a large enough market to support it and as a result population density is the friend of economic progress.  However, later in the book it argues that increasing population caused a decline in the living standards of Japan and Denmark.  This decline supposedly occurred because the increasing population decreased the value of labor and therefore the market for specialization and inventions.  England escapes this fate because of coal and phantom land in the colonies.  This contradiction between the need for human density for specialization and economic progress and the idea that increased population density reduced the value of labor destroying the market for inventions is not adequately resolved.<br /><br />The book argues, starting on page 52, that trade is what allowed homo sapiens to succeed where other apes failed and even other humans failed such as Neanderthals.  It provides numerous examples of how various groups of humans regressed technologically because of inadequate population densities to support specialization, such as Tanzania.  The book summarizes the lessons by quoting economist Julian Simon \\"population leading to diminishing returns is fiction: the induced increase in productivity is scientific fact.\\"  P. 83.<br /><br />In a chapter entitled \\"Escaping Malthus Trap,\\" Ridley discusses how Japan after a period of prosperity gives up its technology.  He states \\"that sometime between 1700 and 1800, the Japanese collectively gave up the plough in favour of the hoe because people were cheaper to hire than draught animals.\\"  P. 198.  The reason for this according to Ridley was rapid population expansion due to paddy rice technology.  This population boom made labor cheap and killed the market for technology.  Denmark follows the same path as Japan and by the 1800s becomes \\"trapped by its own self sufficiency.\\"  P. 200.  Britain escapes the Malthusian trap that Japan, Denmark, and Ireland suffer, according to Ridely, because of selective breeding (maybe p. 200), ghost acres provided by the colonies (p. 202), release valve emigration to the colonies (p. 202), and coal (sustained industrial revolution p. 216.)<br /><br />There is a logical inconsistency between the conclusion early in the book that population density is necessary for prosperity, but later in the book arguing that prosperity stalled after a burst in population in various countries.  The explanation of selective breeding, does not explain why the US or Australia prospered.  These countries were heavily populated by British rejects.  Similarly, the ghost acres provided by the colonies were eventually used up.  It might be argued that there was some tipping point that could only be achieved with ghost acres.  I think this fails also, because it flies in the face of the book's earlier argument that increased population densities allow more specialization and invention to increase everyone's standard of living.  The release valve emigration fails for the same reasons as the ghost acres.  The emergence of coal is also unsatisfying.  Coal mining was known before the birth of Christ and trade in coal occurred in England as far back as the 1300s, according to Wikipedia.  The book also argues that many surges of economic growth were extinguished by parasitic political systems.  However, it never states this is why Japan's and Denmark's prosperity was reversed.<br /><br />What was new in the industrial revolution was not coal, but the machines to use coal and numerous other inventions.  The book argues that these inventions were not in general due to new scientific discoveries, p. 255, and I agree.  So why at this particular point in time did we have a sudden increase in rate of technological advance, including machines that used coal?  The beginning of the industrial revolution coincides with the recognition of property right's in inventions.  The US constitution states (Article 1, section 1, clause 8) that inventors have `RIGHTS\\" in their inventions.  Patents, which are legal title to an invention, are the only free market system for encouraging people to invent.  While Britain had a patent system at least back to the Statute of Monopolies, 1623, it did not recognize a right to property in one's invention.  It was a royal grant, subject to the whims of the ruling monarch.  As a result, it was expensive and arbitrary.  However, when the United States recognizes that inventors have a property right to their invention, this provides a whole new incentive to inventors and their financial backers.  No doubt this attitude towards inventions also infected Britain.  For more on the correlation between real per capita increases in income and patent systems see Source of Economic Growth [...].<br /><br />Mr. Ridley argues that patents at best have marginal effect on the rate of invention.  However, Mr. Ridley shows an appalling lack of knowledge about patents and intellectual property.  He also has a number of inconsistent statements about intellectual property.  For instance, on page 267, he states that copyrights have little effect on the creativity of musical composers.  However, on page 326 he states that Nashville was saved by music entrepreneurs using good local copyrights in the 1930s.  Not only are these two statements contradictory, there is no such thing as local copyrights in the United States.<br /><br />Patents<br />The book has numerous other errors about intellectual property.  For instance, it states that intellectual property is not like other property, because it is useless if you keep it to yourself, p. 262.  This statement is nonsense.  The Coca Cola formula is not shared and this is the only reason it has any value.  A patent to an invention (legal title to an invention) only has value if there is some ability to exclude others from using it - as opposed to knowing about it.  If everyone can make a laser without pay royalties, then it may have value to the world but it has no differential value to the inventor.  Patents are derived from exactly the same philosophical basis as real property.  Namely,  Locke's theory of Natural Rights.  For more information see Scarcity - Does it Prove Intellectual Property is Unjustified? [...]  Below are a list of some, but not all, of the book's errors related to patents:<br /><br />1) The book then states that people get rich by selling each other things and services not ideas, p. 263.  What are authors, professors, engineers, scientists, really selling?  Authors are not selling books, they are selling ideas that just happen to be embodied in books.  The Kindle proves this.  The Kindle does not allow the user to buy a book, but to buy the ideas in a book.  Professors are either selling the teaching of ideas or just an expensive way to bore students.  Engineers are selling a service, which encompasses ideas not the paper (digital ones and zeros) on which it is written.  Most companies do not make money manufacturing things, they make money with inventions (ideas) that are implemented in things.  When a company only sells things with no (new) ideas in these things, then their profit margins are extremely narrow.  One of the limitations on growth has been this Luddite refusal to allow inventors to specialize in inventing.  This book's premise is built on the division of labor, but the author rejects this idea when it comes to inventing.<br /><br />2) Mr. Ridley also seems to be confused between the spread of information related to inventions and the legal right to use that information to build an invention.  It is a major goal of modern patent systems to spread information about inventions so that they can be used by other people to build other inventions.  In the U.S. we built patent depository libraries to spread the wealth of information in patents (before the internet).  Patents encourage people to share the information associated with their inventions instead of keeping them a trade secret.  Countries without patent systems tend to invent mainly things that can be protected with a trade secret.  (See Switzerland before they adopt a patent system)  As a result, other inventors do not get learn from these inventions and the rate of technological progress is inhibited.<br /><br />3) The book perpetuates the first mover advantage alternative to patents.  Xerox had the world's greatest first mover advantage in plain paper copiers, when it agreed to settle an antitrust lawsuit in 1975 by giving away its patent portfolio.  Its market share went from almost 100% in plain paper copiers to 14% in just four years.  The first mover advantage is a fairy tale.<br /><br />4) The book argues, p. 264, that there is no evidence that patents are what drive inventors to invent.  This statement is completely illogical.  Real property rights are not what drive farmers to farm or builders to build houses.  Nevertheless, there would be a lot less building and less efficient farming, if we did not have real property rights.  Just look at countries, where property rights in buildings and land are hard to impossible to obtain.<br /><br />5) The book states that a number of inventions were never patented, p. 264, such as automatic transmission, Bakelite, ballpoint pens, cellophane, cyclotrons, gyrocompasses, jet engines, magnetic recording, power steering, safety razors and zippers.  While it is possible that the first version of some of these inventions were not patented, all of these inventions were subject to numerous patents.  This can be easily verified with a simple patent search.  For instance, there are at least 20 patents and probably hundreds of patents on automatic transmissions.  The same is true of ballpoint pens, gyrocompasses, jet engines, magnetic recording, power steering, safety razors and zippers.  A simple internet search shows that chemist Leo Hendrik Baekeland (1863-1944) invented and first patented the synthetic resin that we know as Bakelite in 1907.  Jacques E Brandenberger was granted patents to cover the machinery and the essential ideas of his manufacturing process of the new film (cellophane).  The assertions of no patents for the zipper is also easily shown to be incorrect.  Elias Howe, who invented the sewing machine received a patent in 1851 for an 'Automatic, Continuous Clothing Closure' (zipper).<br /><br />6) The book argues that the Wright brothers, enforcing their patent on airplane control surfaces, supposedly shut down the airplane industry in the US.  This is the typical propaganda of open source community.  First of all the Wright brothers were building airplanes, so the industry was not shut down by enforcement of the patents.  Second stealing other people's property is not shutting down industry, it is shutting down theft.  We would not say that someone stopped the harvest of wheat, because they did not let someone else reap the wheat they planted on their land.<br /><br />7) The patent thicket argument is repeated by Mr. Ridley to suggest that patents inhibit advances in technology.  A number of papers  have shown that there is no empirical evidence for the patent thicket argument and that the logical analogies on which it is based are flawed.  For more information see  Intellectual Property Socialism: Part IV USPTO Takes Aim at Inventors [...].<br /><br />8) Mr. Ridley further demonstrates his ignorance of patents by repeating the concern that the US Patent Office was issuing patents for human genes in the 1990s, p. 265.  What the Patent Office did and does was issue patents on \\"isolated genes.\\"  This is similar to patents on things like isolated forms of vitamin B12, which was patented.  For more information see Gene Patenting Debate Continues [...]<br /><br />9) The book also mistakenly calls a patent a \\"temporary monopoly.\\"  A patent is a property right, just like property rights in land, houses, cars, etc.  The logical basis for patents is exactly the same as other property rights.  Property rights are based on Natural Rights, which states that since you own yourself you own the product of your labor (physical and mental).  For more information see The Myth that Patents are Monopolies [...].<br /><br />10) He also implies that patents are top down solution to encouraging invention.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  All a patent system does is provide property rights to inventors for their inventions.  This is similar to property rights for land, which is a bottom up way to increase the productivity of farming for instance.  Just giving pseudo property rights to peasants in the USSR and China caused enormous increases in farm production.  Property rights are a bottom up solution, not a top down solution.  In fact, the genius of the United States patent system (as opposed to Britain's) is that it was accessible to all people, including women and slaves that had no property rights under their state laws.  This encouraged a torrent of inventive activity in the U.S. that propelled it from a backward farming country to an economic and technological powerhouse in the world in less than 60 years.  For more information see the excellent book by B. Zorina Kahn, The Democratization of Invention: Patents and Copyrights in American Economic Development, 1790-1920.<br /><br />Open Source<br />I am convinced that Mr. Ridley's poor research on patents and intellectual property is due to his infatuation with the open source movement.  On page 356 he opines that genetic research will soon go open source.  He is so excited about open source that he eventually suggests a Marxist's open source utopia - \\"Thanks to the internet, each is giving according to his ability to each according to his needs, to a degree that never happen in Marxism.\\" P. 356<br /><br />The open source movement has been a dismal failure.  Its biggest success has been to extend UNIX (LINUX) to personal computers, other platforms, and add new features.  Open source has mainly extended existing technologies, much like the incremental invention that can be expected from large companies.  The open source movement deludes itself into believing they are fighting some sort of David versus Goliath battle against large corporations and the patent system.  The reality is that open source developers are giving large corporations, such as IBM, their efforts for free and weakening the bargaining power of technical personnel.  The open source movement plays right into the hands of large corporations and other large institutions, by weakening the property rights of developers in their work.  It should be no surprise that open source has been an abysmal failure, since this exactly the situation most of the world lived under until 1800.  Before modern patent systems, new inventions were rare and the return for the invention was often controlled by a trade guild.  The members of the trade guild profited equally, meaning there was little incentive for the inventor to spend time creating.  Per capita income of the world before 1800 had been stagnant for millennia.  Where modern patent laws were adopted around 1800, incredible increases in per capita income occurred.  Mr. Ridley trumpets this progress throughout his book.  In areas without patent systems, we see stagnant growth in per capita income.  For instance, Japan's per capita income does not take off until they copy the US patent system in the 1860s.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that this excellent book is disfigured by the author's irrational infatuation with the open source movement.  This infatuation causes the author to embrace the logical contradiction that increases in population density increase economic growth and also causes the Malthusian trap (decreases in economic growth).  It also causes him to reject the solution to the Malthusian trap, which is the recognition of property rights in inventions.<br /><br />Dale B.

0060557818|5.0|Neil Gaiman is imaginitive, clever and can weave a witty and utterly believeable story out of whole cloth.  This is particularly true in _Neverwhere_.  Set in London, the boringly average Richard Mayhew leads a boringly average life: a beautiful, domineering girlfriend, a job in middle-management, and the world makes sense to him.  Until he meets Door, who shows him \\"London Below\\" - a city alongside Richard's London, but one very different, and much more dangerous.<br /><br />Richard's experiences in London Below is the classic hero's journey: the refusal of the call, the mentor, and so on.  The predictability of events, however in no way diminish from the richness of the experience, especially given Gaiman's playful wit as he takes the mundane and common in London and recreates it.  Tube stations become literal (Blackfriars, for example, is a station that leads to a monestary of ruddy-skinned, black cowled monks, and the ubiquitous London call \\"mind the gap\\" has sinister implications for those who don't mind it.)  It is an utterly captivating read.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Gaiman's work, this (or [[ASIN:0060558121 American Gods: A Novel]]) would be my recommendations to start.  Fair warning: once you've experienced the creativity and uniqueness of his writing, you will want to read more by him.  For those who have read his work, this certainly among his best work.  Highly recommended.

0439023483|4.0|When my daughter can't put a book down, and upon completing it tells me I *have* to read it because it was *so* good (as only an earnest young girl can do), I was forced to relent.  The story line of _The Hunger Games_ is equal parts \\"The Lottery\\" by Shirley Jackson, \\"The Running Man\\" by Stephen King, and the TV series \\"Survivor.\\"  In the dystopian future America, the nation is broken into (originally 13, now 12) districts.  Annually each district holds a lottery where a boy and a girl (aged 12 - 18) is chosen to represent their district in \\"the Hunger Games\\" - televised games, not unlike the Olympics, where these children compete to the death, only one survivor being declared the winner of the games, the winner's district awarded food, fame and accolades.  (The details of how and why the games began is a plot point I won't get into here.)<br /><br />The process of selection of champions, the brief training the protagonist recieves, and the brutality of the games made for riveting reading.  I wholly understand why my daughter could not put the book down, as I, too was pulled into it - an irony, as the reader, being riveted to the drama of the Games, is complicit in its barbarity.  Another bitter irony of the story is the heroine, Katniss develops a relationship with Peeta, the other representative from her district; of course, there can be only one winner of the games, a realization that is never far from Katniss' mind.<br /><br />For young adult readers, I can see how this book would work well on a number of levels: the story line is taught and suspenseful; where there is violence, it is graphic and brutal (a sure hit with teen boys); there is a romantic angle between Katniss and Peeta - but it is portaryed with sympathy and realism, as Katniss struggles with whether her feelings are authentic, or if they are a function of her simply \\"playing the game\\" (much as young teens struggle with their first relationships and the feelings they engender.)  For adults, the vouyeristic nature of entertainment (the \\"Hunger Games\\" are a wonderful metaphor for any popular reality televison show) and the questions it raises about ethics and morality are never far from the story line.  In a similar vein, the issues of class and privlidge are brought up (not only between Katniss and Peeta, but also between the champions of the various districts.)  Simply put, there is a lot going on in this book that provides food for thought for a wide variety of ages.  I was, however, frustrated by the lack of catharsis: while the immeadiate story of the Hunger Games ends, it is clear that there is much more to be told, and readers are (to some extent) left hanging in order to read the next in the series.  This was a little aggravating.<br /><br />I don't read much \\"young adult\\" material; with that said, this would certainly be one of the books of that genre that I would recommend - the plot is a bit used, but issues and questions it raises are not the \\"bubble-gum\\" fluff one typically associates with writing geared towards this audience.e of entertainment (the \\"Hunger Games\\" are a wonderful metaphor for any popular reality televison show) and the questions it raises about ethics and morality are never far from the story line.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|I've been a fan of Doctor Who since 2005 when Christopher Eccleston took the title role. After that first season I didn't think anyone else could top him but of course David Tennant came along and made the character iconic from the get go. After three seasons and some so-so films I was ready to stop watching the show because I didn't think anyone could top David Tennant, nor did I want them to. Imagine my surprise when I watched the first episode of Dr. Who season 5 and was rooting for Matt Smith from the get go!<br /><br />Doctor Who season 5 sets itself apart from the first four seasons by creating a completely new plot. There's a crack running through all of time and space that's erasing all of existence. The Doctor meets new companion Amy Pond who's connected to this rift somehow and it keeps popping up wherever they go. The episodes seem like standard Dr. Who fare (somethings wrong in some part of space/time, they investigate, nothing's as it seems, Doctor pulls some idea out of no-where nd saves the day with a speech in the end). That is until a few episodes in and we get the two-parter 'Time of Angels'/'Flesh in Stone'. These two episodes bring a level of suspense rarely seen in television and make up for the more formula episodes in the season (though the finale, which is also a two-parter manages to tie in the more mundane episodes into the overall plot). To put it simply, the story of this season is not to be missed!<br /><br />As I said before I was hesitant about Matt Smith as the Doctor. The promo-shots with him in the bow-tie made me want to gag and his youthful appearance made me afraid he was going to ruin a good mature character. Of course I was wrong; Smith's Doctor is more naive but he's got a charm that's completely his own and I'll admit he's my favorite incarnation of he Doctor to date, bow-tie and all! Just as good (or maybe better) is actress Karen Gillan as companion Amy Pond. While Amy's very taken with the Doctor at first she's not afraid to talk back to him and throw his self-righteousness back in his face! Their relationship in the season is really something to see!<br /><br />While this season of Doctor Who is very different than previous series, it's no less impressive (and in my opinion MORE impressive). It strikes the perfect feeling of familarity and uniquenes. I like the fact that not everyone follow's the Doctor based on his high-morals and I love a human companion who's not afraid to question him. This season's a winner and in my opinion is one of the best shows that's aired in 2010!him and throw his self-righteousness back in his face!

B002ZCDR88|1.0|You will not find a harder core fan Natalie Merchant fan than me.  Her music is so beautiful, it can leave you breathless, and nigh unto tears... but this... what's this? Her new direction... is a mix of an Irish Folky - Hoe-Down sounding, Jazzy styled music.  This is so far different than anything she's ever done.  I'm floored by the reviews on Amazon.com, how lightening quickly they filled up with dozens and dozens of perfect long essay length five star detailed reviews... I smell shills.  Thus is Amazon, but anyways, just give it a listen. I can't find one \\"good\\" song on here, good as in like her old stuff.  If you happen to like blue-grass, old Jazz style, or Irish folk music, and Natalie, then you will probably like these CDs.  If you adore the sweet long heavenly notes of this female vocalists that swoon you info bliss, you will not find it here.  Sorry Natalie, at least I still have all your old CDs that it's hard to find one song I don't love.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Director/writer Christopher Nolan has explored dark, obsessive characters in exemplary films like The Dark Knight.  In his most ambitious story yet (one that took ten years to develop), he designs a thoroughly complex story with concurrent narratives (think Godfather Part II or Intolerance) where (like his earliest film, Following, and his classic, Momento,) time and reality are bent and juxtaposed.  This is not light, escapist fare but a deep, convoluted story that engages the mind and heart, and few movies in recent years can be so challenging yet rewarding to its audience.     A man named Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) washes ashore and is taken by armed guards to an old man.  From there the film begins to jump in different settings or dream states.  Cobb is an expert at the art of `inception', the ability to enter people's subconscious to steal an idea or plant one.  A fugitive, he longs to be reunited with his two children and is constantly plagued by recurring visions of his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who becomes increasingly dangerous.  A wealthy Asian businessman, Saito (Ken Watanabe), makes a proposition to Cobb: extract a piece of information from a rival businessman (Cillian Murphy), and Cobb gets to return home to his kids.  Vowing this to be his last job, Cobb assembles his team of experts, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a newbie architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), a forger and impersonator, Earnes (Tom Hardy), and a drug chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao).  To infiltrate Fischer's mind, the team designs an elaborate set of dreams within dreams to effect a con game.  This compounds the risks and, as Cobb finds himself being harassed by a more menacing Mal, the team encounters last minute crises that force Cobb to make a desperate choice.  Can they get Fischer to reveal his secrets in time, and what of Cobb's personal obsession?      The plot brings to mind the alternative realities of The Matrix, Dreamscape, and Altered States.  Like the magicians in Nolan's The Prestige, it is a slight of hand where much of the film's narrative plays like stream of consciousness.  It's about a lifetime of love that's experienced in mere flashes or an eternity, and despite the film's intricate machinations, its simple themes are the search for validation and love.  The film is also about the need of letting go and taking a leap of faith.  At times you wonder if any given scene is real or a dream, and that is the conceit of the film; for some, the dream IS the reality.     The team concept is in keeping with Mission: Impossible and Oceans 11 (any version) as each member's expertise comes into play, and the deeper the team goes into the dreams, the greater the risks.  In one key sequence set in a snow mountain compound, there is an obvious homage to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and you wonder what wonders Nolan could work on the James Bond franchise!      This `dream' cast works together very well and includes Nolan's repertory actors, Murphy and Caine.  DiCaprio (looking astonishingly like Nolan) does an excellent job as the tortured soul with a dark secret.  Cotillard is hauntingly beautiful as Cobb's wife while the younger Page is adorable as the bright architect who also serves as Cobb's moral compass when he begins to falter and have self doubts.      The film's technical accomplishments are outstanding, and although the special effects are terrific in depicting the mind bending scenery, the live action sets and stunt work (with Levitt doing some remarkable acrobatics) are even more impressive in depicting mixed gravity where people float or walk on walls and ceilings.  In a masterful blend of film editing, the dream sequences shuttle back and forth, and time is slowed to a crawl in one instance, and given years in another.  Hans Zimmer's relentless, minimalist score is a particularly noteworthy achievement of mood and dramatic pacing.      This is not a perfect film, and (at two and one-half hours) there are moments where you think Nolan could have explored more of his subjects.   A director like Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard might have emotionally milked certain scenes for all they are worth, and it is because of that, we expect a bit more connection and feelings.  Like most of Nolan's films, the brooding characters and situations are almost entirely devoid of humor or any lighthearted tone which brings to mind any number of Stanley Kubrick films.  While some may find the ending a bit too neat or perhaps too open ended, it is left to the audience to decide how to interpret the meaning of the finale.  Yet these are minor quibbles for grand, pure cinematic experience.  Nolan has created something so special that it engages the mind. How dare he?    With Inception, Christopher Nolan is most certainly one of the best film directors.  His previous masterpiece, The Dark Knight, should have been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar.  Come to think of it, that very film helped change the Oscar rules to expand from five to ten nominees so that gems like Inception are not left out.  It won't be.  Do take this wild ride, and you'll find that you are obsessed with its mystery and beauty and repeating the journey again and again.

B001BGTWXI|5.0|Slipknot is a band often criticized by many simply for being \\"Nu Metal\\".  Does this somehow imply that they are a horrible band?  No, not at all.  In fact, Slipknot is a very polished Nu Metal band that constantly evolves with each sequential album release.  Starting off as a more traditional, one dimensional Nu Metal band with their self titled album, Slipknot has made strides to gradually step in other directions in terms of musical style.<br /><br />Up to this point, \\"Iowa\\" had been the band's \\"heaviest\\" release to date, and \\"Vol. 3\\" was regarded as their most alternative record to date.  Well, \\"All Hope is Gone\\" finds a nice balance between the two styles.  Utilizing heavier tracks (much like \\"Iowa\\") yet at the same time throwing in more melody (like \\"Vol. 3\\"), \\"All Hope is Gone\\" shows all of Slipknot's musical skills in terms of both styles that the band has experimented with in the past.<br /><br />The album starts off fast and heavy, bringing out heavy hitting tracks like \\"Gematria (The Killing Name)\\", \\"Sulfur\\" and \\"Psychosocial\\".  These tracks resemble classic Slipknot sound, while still throwing in more melody than past releases.  Utilizing Corey's traditional \\"yells\\" for the majority of the play length of these tracks, the opening songs are very similar to older work done by the band.  From here, the album begins to take a more \\"alternative\\" sound, and almost all of the yells associated with Slipknot tracks are absent in the majority of the tracks remaining.<br /><br />Songs begin to slow down, showing that Slipknot is more than just the one dimensional band that they are stereotyped as.  The album still throws in the occasional heavy hitting song, such as \\"Wherein Lies Continue\\", \\"This Cold Black\\" and \\"All Hope is Gone\\".  The majority of the album, however, consists of easy to listen to, slow songs, with clean vocals and lots of melody.  This is good move for the band to experiment with, and the results are beautiful.<br /><br />Despite the fact that \\"All Hope is Gone\\" features multiple songs that utilize a slower pacing, and a more alternative sounding singing style, the album is still top notch and worth listening to.  Tracks like \\"Dead Memories\\", \\"Snuff\\", and \\"Gehenna\\" are very well done songs, and are actually quite catchy.  It's true that this album is not true to Slipknot's original sound that drew so many fans in to begin with, but credit should be given to the band for trying out new styles and taking time to evolve as a whole.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm too open minded to music (loving everything from Alternative Rock, to Black Metal, Death Metal and Grind) that when a band tries out a new style I usually consider it an intriguing progression for the band.  As long as you are tolerant of a large variety of musical styles and genres, then I'm sure you'll find something worth listening to, whether that includes the heavier tracks found on \\"All Hope is Gone\\" or the alternative songs, there's a little bit for everyone to enjoy to a degree.ple songs that utilize a slower pacing, and a more alternative sounding singing style, the album is still top notch and worth listening to.

0307277453|4.0|This book is written at a level that is easily accessible to the non-scientific public. The writer integrates down-to-earth information about what it's actually like to do fieldwork  (a mixture of pain and pleasure, but mostly pain) with explanations of how findings in the field (and the lab) add to our understanding of evolutionary theory.  Most of the \\"science\\" in the book is part of a high school biology curriculum, but the way in which Neil Shubin shares his personal experiences brings the concepts to life.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Simply an amazing movie.  It is a story you can get lost in and forget about the real world for a while.
0446310786|5.0|For a person who tends to be overly critical of religious institutions, I am hardly ever critical of \\"good\\" religious people. In this book, there's an exemplar of what a good religious-Christian person is in Atticus Finch. For anyone who thinks this book is solely about racism, which I did prior to having read it or even having seen the movie-adaptation, would be a gross oversimplification of the novel. It's an exploration in morality and Lee uses a very powerful vehicle: Children. Children learn through, what most call growing up, socialization and the social norms and understandings guiding everyday life. Here, Lee focuses on primary agents, notably the family. You see a stark contrast within the Finch family between Atticus and his \\"proper\\" sister Alexandra. The morality each shares is different. Therefore, it stands to reason that children will think in very different moral terms.    Using children is powerful because in many ways, they are a tabula rosa.  However, if you have an extraordinary person like an Atticus Finch teaching morality, then you realize that the social word is full of immorality and illogicalness. This is what Harper Lee points out with the problems of Social Inequality, of a pseudo-Caste system, and of racism. Both Jem and Scout see and come into conflict with these ideas in major and minor things: Who is acceptable to bring home to dinner all the way to institutional racism within the legal system. These are norms and values most people accept in the town. However, she implicitly points out that that everyone is a product of some environment and some way of learning: As Atticus tells Scout and Jem to put themselves in others skin before they act... They understand why some people act the way they do, such as poor Boo Radley. What this does is point that there is both good and evil in people but if you got to know them... you'd see the good. Although she does give a caveat later in the novel about how some people can never be reached. In the end, there is good and there is evil... and they both co-exist.

B00006G8K0|4.0|I was never interested in seeing a Christopher Lee Dracula film since I figured the Bela Lugosi version or Nosferatu were superior. But when watching Dracula last year I was thinking it was really good but not as exciting as I remember as a child. While watching Horror of Dracula though it dawned on me that this is actually the version I remember as a child.<br /><br />The end of Horror of Dracula is so much more memorable and is the way I thought the Bela Lugosi version ended, because the end is so well made that it could only be from the classic 30's version I thought. The movies are very similar of course but Christopher Lee hams it up less than Legosi. His performance is less talky and more bite. There's just something about the faces he makes with fangs that makes it hard to believe that he's not really a vampire. His performance is all in the fangs.<br /><br />Peter Cushing is also excellent as Van Helsing and possibly the best. Van Helsing isn't meant to be an action hero like in the Hugh Jackman film. He's just an expert on vampires and he's willing to stop them if necessary, but in no way is he a big bad monster hunter. Still, Cushing's Van Helsing has a presence about him that makes you think the guy can handle himself. He steals the show as soon as he's introduced. He may have many lines and the film may be slow at times but you're always intrigued by what he has to say even if you know the story and have already seen many Dracula films.
B003L45JLW|5.0|If you like great sounding music then get the Bluray it is far better than the CD. Awesome dynamics - like the band is with you in the room. This recording is stellar. Just crank it and enjoy. This is one of the top sounding r'n'roll/blues productions evah!    I wish Petty and other artists would release more material on Bluray in higher resolution - night and day versus iTunes downloads or MP3's or CD's! The BD even comes with a FLAC 24 bit 48 KHz stereo download code - so you can enjoy this great sound on your PC with iTunes or any other music player.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I watched this movie when it came out solely because it was Elijah Wood's next film after Lord of the Rings. Although a completely opposite role, it quickly became a favorite and I have watched it several times. (Just discovered whoever I loaned my copy to didn't return it, so I am ordering another.) This movie, to me, is about 2 grandsons and 2 grandfathers.  One grandson appears 'anal-retentive' and fearful of forgetting where he came from but also aware of  the importance of family in his life. The other, carefree and living mostly for the moment, states the past should be left in the past. Both love their grandfathers.  One grandfather has never forgotten his past and passes a piece of it on to his grandson.  The other grandfather has completely closed his past and may not even remember it himself.    The juxtaposition of the old and the new (for example, the 2 in babushkas on a bench, and then the camera rises and you see the skate park), the delightful music, and the hilarious, broken English all add to this wonderful film, that made me laugh, cry and think.  I highly recommend it.
B000089A07|2.0|As usual, I'm here to look at the flaws mainly.    1. Hannibal in this third installment is not how he usually is in previous installments. He is still smart and witty and quick to speak, but not poetic and the suspense in his tone is lacking or not there. You have to sort of watch the others and this back to back to see the difference. I just find his verbal scenes in this one a lot less satisfying, the Hannibal signature is starting to lack. It's hard to describe.    2. The new main character, Edward Norton, is a great actor HOWEVER he does not fit this role nearly as well as his predecessors. He just doesn't have it. He's a fantastic actor in other movies, he just doesn't fit this role much in this one IMO. He doesn't look the part nor is he meant for it.    3. The pace of the movie. I feel it is a bit quick and doesn't have the mystery feel behind it like it usually does. Hannibal usually assists with this area significantly, but his role feels rather lacking not to mention it differs from the usual. Basically, I'm missing the similar suspense and story build up. It doesn't interest me like the others.    4. The scene with the reporter I believe? Slightly past the one hour mark of the movie and the scene with the killer (no this is not a spoiler....) This is where the acting goes to h*ll. Just watch it, the whole entire scene becomes a joke and I almost had to keep myself from laughing. Like the movie was sorta okay, then suddenly they threw in some goof balls....it almost became a comedy of some sorts. Just watch the whole scene from their encounter, just plain laughable directing and acting.    5. !!WARNING POSSIBLE OPENING SCENE SPOILER ALERT!! I'll just admit straight out that the opening scene itself is flawed because in the prequels of this making, Hannibal is usually portrayed purposefully as someone almost invulnerable, impossibly witty and sly. Him getting killed the way he did in the beginning is a grave mistake, especially with such a lame and outright approach. He's the great Hannibal Lecter, getting stabbed with some arrows and shot during a lame charge is an insult....    6. LMAO! I'm still watching this and they describe the villain as a very strong person that is possibly a body builder! Based on the weights that he lifted in the earlier parts of the movie, there is no way he is that darn strong. He is not exceptionally or extraordinarily strong or buff enough for him to set himself apart from many other people out there, especially enough to help narrow the search down to just him. He looks like an average man, not even muscly either!      7. !!POSSIBLE VILLAIN'S WEAPON CHOICE SPOILER!!The villain's choice of weapon is one huge thing degrades the movie, how can you have a Hannibal related villain that runs around with a silencer gun....I mean come on! We want our villains to remain brutal, man eating, gore loving, hands on murderers! Not some little pansy with a gun, guns are for wimps. I do also take note that the villain in the first movie also slightly uses a gun, but he fits the other description so it's negligible.     8. The ending was a bit confusing but basically there's a twist. I won't tell you the twist, but like other reviewers, I have to agree that it is indeed lame.    9. !!POSSIBLE NEAR ENDING SPOILER ALERT!! Okay does anyone even know how the heck that blind woman got out of that ring of fire near the end? I mean COME ON!          IN CONCLUSION:    Anyone that gives or have given this movie a star rating of 4 or 5 is out of their mind. Take in mind that only 5 percent or less of the population knows what is good and what is bad. This movie is not horrific, but it does not belong in the same line as the previous two. Will not watch again.

Is is quite an interesting read and keeps the reader aksing \\"what happens next.\\" However, by the end of it the reader is left horriblt disapointed and asking himself, \\"what is the point of it all?\\" But this is only my opinion. I do not recommend this book.

B00012QM8G|5.0|One of the greatest films of all-time! Very direct and gut-wrenchingly accurate and painful. The true hate and animal behavior of the Nazi regime is shown here in all it's glorious disgusting inhuman truth! I'm so glad I didn't live through that time. But I hope we never forget it! The worst part is for the most part people have forgotten. Today's youth certainly has. They don't really know what really happened and that is a shame. Mankind has really sunk to some low places in human behavior and this ranks as one of, if not the lowest, point in human history! But don't forget we also had Stalin and the Japanese warlords competing with the Nazis for worst place! Seventy years ago and we've been through very many more since. I wonder if humankind will ever not do these things. It always seems hate takes hold and runs amok for sometime before reason and sanity take over and conquer the hate. A visious cylce it seems. Watch this film and never forget! Tell your kids to watch it too. And your grandkids and others as well. We can never allow this to happen again. Never!
B003PGNBO8|2.0|I was hopeful about this show for the entire season.  One thing I must say is that the actors did a great job.  Acting was superb and that was the main thing that kept me going.  The story was weak and slow.  I spent the entire season telling myself that this whole thing will lead to a great finale where I will sit on the edge of my seat screaming at the TV \\"Why did this have to end?!\\"  The show raises the question of are we truly bout to our destiny.  The choices that the characters make sometimes do not make sense and it feels like the writers were trying really hard to make that character stay on his path.  Eventually this long convoluted show ended in a boring finale that made me only regret the entire time i wasted behind the TV wishing for something better.

1439165645|5.0|Through the highly imaginative and captivating unfolding of the life story of the novel's main character, Hassan Haji, Richard Morais has given us a timeless, magical story that from the first page lovingly and romantically embraces the reader around the unfolding of a universal theme.  That theme is Hassan's unrelenting, heroic pursuit of his destiny, overcoming some very heavy odds.  Quite a journey - his roots were those of a pre-WW11 Indian family of poor Muslim subsistence farmers.  His journey culminated many decades later when the restaurant he created in rural France achieved the recognition and honor of earning 3 Stars.  We are given a front row seat to his process of both life-discovery, and of his personal self-discovery, emergence and crystalization as a very wise and compete person and a premier chef.    In telling Hassan's story, Morais weaves us through multiple continents, countries, fascinating cultures and characters and unforgettable cuisine.  The authenticity, graphic description and feel of Hassan's experiences speaks to the many years of expat living of the author.  As Hassan's life narrative unfolds, and because Marais excels at communicating experiences, we get to virtually smell and taste the emergence of his artistry as a chef.  The author's obvious love of food is passionately sprinkled, chopped and poured throughout.    Among the many things Hassan's journey reveals, one that stands out to me is how he ultimately succeeds in achieving his destiny and simultaneously learns the importance of trusting and believing in himself and his craft.  I highly recommend The Hundred-Foot Journey.

B000J3EEBY|5.0|After the death of her fiance, Loreena McKennitt went into retirement for several years. But when she returned, she came back in a big way -- \\"An Ancient Muse,\\" a haunting little album filled with Middle-Eastern grandeur and Celtic bittersweet beauty. In other words, McKennitt picked up where she left off, and the years have not dulled the richness of her music.<br /><br />In a way, the album feels like it follows a day all across Europe and the Middle East. It begins with \\"Incantation,\\" a slow sunrise of a song filled with murmuring vocals and dark sweeps of strings, before segueing into the lazy half-lit twangs and angles of \\"The Gates of Istanbul\\" and the peppy sand-swept ballad of \\"Caravanserai.\\"<br /><br />Then McKennitt moves into colder climates with the wistful, string-soaked ballad \\"The English Ladye and The Knight\\" (all about a lady in love with a Scottish knight -- cue tragedy), the swirling \\"Kecharitomene\\" and the painfully lovely \\"Penelope's Song.\\" With the final leg of the album, she drifts into the twangy Eastern European flavors of \\"Sacred Shabbat,\\" the lush twilight tones of \\"Beneath a Phrygian Sky,\\" and finishing with the soft lulling beauty of \\"Never-Ending Road (Amhr&aacute;n Duit).\\"<br /><br />\\"An Ancient Muse\\" is only nine songs long, but it's one of those albums that feels like a full meal once you've finished it. There are a couple songs that aren't quite brilliant all the time (\\"Sacred Shabbat\\" just didn't grab me), but overall McKennit picks up where she left off in the late nineties -- lush multi-instrumental music laced with angelic vocals, flavored with the mystical.<br /><br />Her music brims over with silky strings, piano, guitar, keyboards, harp, angular accordion and earthy drums, as well as more exotic instruments like the bouzouki, the oud, the Turkish clarinet, the tabla and the lyra.

Although, I heard hints of \\"The Mummer's Dance\\" in a couple of the melodies.<br /><br />Her voice is also incredibly lovely, rich and angelic in all the songs she sings in. Her lyrics are similarly rich -- she seems to make nature itself into a light-filled temple (\\"The sand was shimmering in the morning light/And dancing off the dunes so far away\\"), even as she often sings of yearning and lost love (\\"And in the night when our dreams are still/Or when the wind calls free/I'll keep your heart with mine/Till you come to me\\").<br /><br />It took many years for Loreena McKennitt to make a full return to musicmaking, and \\"The Ancient Muse\\" is a short but good reminder of why she was worth waiting for.

She is so judge-like that she is literally a judge; A judge who judges things.    Peter turns on his computer and opens a file that makes him cry. He is so sad he forgets how to exit out of a word document and instead starts pressing ctrl+alt+delete because Jodi Picoult is not familiar with computer.

When told not to enter because he would be defying protocol, he states \\"There is no f**king protocol for this.\\" (Oh snap!) Then he busts into the school like a cop who plays by his own rules, and finds a bunch of dead bodies that have been shot to death because they were murdered. With bullets. He finds Josie cowering in a locker room beside her dead boyfriend.    --Seventeen years before--    Oh man, so Alex is taking these pregnancy yoga mom tranquility classes and stuff because she's pregnant with Josie. Lacy is the teacher just so she can seem important later on in the story. Alex doesn't want her baby because she got knocked up by some old man named Logan who did not care about her.    Lacy has a baby, and leaves it with Alex when she goes to the bathroom or something. Alex sees how annoying the baby is and decides \\"I want one.\\" Lacy still thinks Alex wants an abortion, but then Alex freaks out because she thinks she had a miscarriage and Lacy's all \\"You do want the baby! Man, what a strong independent woman you are, like those women on lifetime who do strong independent things like being independent and strong.\\"    Before Alex has her baby, Lacy says \\"Let's do this together,\\" which is a total 'that's what she said' moment. Then Alex births her baby and she is a mom, because moms have babies. Picoult is a genius.    --Present day--    Patrick is investigating dead bodies. John crawls out of a closet and flies out a window. Lacy, Peter's mom, arrives at the school in search of her son, but surprise! Her son shot up the school. Some unimportant people and Mr. McCabe are found dead.    Josie has amnesia. Lacy is all like \\"How could my son do this?\\" Jordan McAfee is called to be Peter's defense attorney.    --Twelve years before--    Peter loves the idea of school so much, he skips sleep because kindergarten will be so unbearably awesome. He gets on the school bus and some stereotypical bullies take his superman lunchbox and throw it out the window. The bus driver is like \\"Hey kids, settle down.\\" and doesn't care at all. This happens three times within the month, because the bus driver is either one of the bullies or sleeping. Alex thinks about the differences between a judge and a mother, and thinks some things that are supposed to connect to the reader.    Lacy learns that because Peter is being bullied, he should become a bully too, because problems are handled with fists no matter what. Josie and Peter are best friends because neither one of them cares about social status. Alex and Lacy lose track of their kids and find the two playing with a RIFLE. A GUN. AN ENTIRE ONE. Alex FREAKS OUT because she's a MOM. A SOMEWHAT RESPONSIBLE MOM. She forbids Josie from socializing with Peter anymore.    Peter's dad starts teaching him about guns at age 6 because Peter has the psychological capacity of a lonely 46 year old Harvard professor.    (At this point I'm going to stop following along with the book and just write what I remember.)    Josie grows up and starts being popular because she wears makeup and does generic popular teenager things. She disses Peter because he's not popular. Peter is sad. He starts coding complicated computer games, somehow in basic HTML. Matt and Drew pick on him because he is unpopular.    Matt is a douche. After Josie found out her dad wanted nothing to do with her, he was all \\"Let's have sex on the side of the road.\\" Then they did, because that's what happens after dramatic first encounters with unknown fathers. She thinks about mild philosophical things all the time, because she is complicated on the inside but not really. She hates herself because she won't be herself, because she hates herself. I know, right?    Peter is confused about his sexual preference, because he showers naked with dudes. He goes to a gay bar and starts playingpool with some gay dude. The gay dude assumes giving up a few of his quarters guarantees him his way with Peter, but suddenly Mr. McCabe, gay math teacher incognito, trots into the room on a shining rainbow-colored unicorn and saves Peter. He drives Peter home, if you know what I mean. Peter denies being gay and runs all the way down his street to get away from his gay thoughts.    One time, Peter got stuck in an elevator with Josie, because it was important to the story. She kissed him because he dared her to. Later on he sent her a letter revealing his love for her, and Courtney Ignatio (Alpha female) conveniently found it first and spammed it out to the whole school just because she could. Man these high school kids are so original and unpredictable, their pranks know no bounds. When Peter approaches Josie about her reaction to the letter, he gets pantsed in front of the cafeteria by Matt. Everyone laughs because he is half naked. Some teacher runs up and is like \\"Is that all or do you want detention?!\\" when he clearly should have escorted Matt to the principal's office right there. He doesn't, because clearly he does not care about the students at all.    Peter takes all of his built-up frustration and shoots up his school, killing 10 and wounding others. He even stopped for a bowl of rice krispies, because they are just that delicious.    (Like 12 unimportant backstories.)    (Way later on)    Patrick, the detective guy, makes out with Alex and they become a couple. Josie finds out and is like \\"whatevs\\", because Patrick turns out to be an alright guy. Alex was going to be the judge on Peter's trial, but couldn't because her daughter was too involved. Peter goes to trial and everyone hates him. People testify for him and everyone still hates him. Josie remembers everything, then goes up to testify. Turns out one of the two gunshot wounds in her boyfriend was caused by her, because she loved him so much she hated him, and vice versa. Random unimportant backstoryof how he got her pregnant but she miscarried.    Peter ends up being charged with 8 accounts of manslaughter and two accounts of 'they deserved it', and Josie is sentenced to 5 years in prison. Alex and Patrick are having a baby together. The end.

B00006AW2F|5.0|This compilation album contains songs that are outtakes and alternate versions of well-known songs recorded from 1964 to 1970. Some of them never made it on any of the Stones' albums from 1964 to 1970, but a fare few of them can be found on any one of those albums during that span. Hope that anyone can enjoy this, because this one has songs you wouldn't believe they did unless you heard them.

0756405890|5.0|Here's my review from an everyday regular guy who enjoys reading: I found this book by accident while searching for a good Fantasy Fiction book to read. I have just started getting into Fantasy Fiction. This is only the second Fantasy Fiction book that I've read.I could not put this book down! After reading some of the negative reviews,I think some people just didn't understand how this story is told. The main character \\"Kvothe\\" is telling the story of his life to a scribe named \\"Chronicler\\". So when you read this book, you are being TOLD the story by the main character. There are breaks in the story telling. I think some readers expect something to happen during this \\"break\\" - like that's when the story will unfold. This book reads the same way a friend would be telling you the story of his life - if he wanted you to write it down. Kvothe's life IS the story. This is a very entertaining book that left me wanting more every time i picked it up. Can't wait for the sequel. If you want an easy reading, great book that you can't put down - this is it!
B0000696I0|3.0|The turtles return in this action but yet comic movie return.  While the story picks up where our heroes were pretty much left off, like where they're staying at and what lays ahead for our favorite reptiles.  Though the story focuses on the story on how the turtles came about to their present state and the foot trying their best to get their hands on the last canister of the stuff better known as 'the ooze'.  Although the foot got the ooze and created two new mutants known as 'Tokka' and 'Rahza' to tackle their enemies.  One of my complaints with the movie is that there's no Casey Jones in the movie, and it don't feel the same without that nut making an appearence in the movie, though the movie I felt that it was still good even with the flaws that the movie has.  My other complaint is that Shredder didn't get a proper death but I can't go about changing that.  As for any extras, there aren't that many extras to go with in this release.  Overall I give this 3 stars out of 5.
B001TH8UUA|4.0|I compared various cables from Monster, Sony, Vizio and others and finally decided to go for this one.  I noticed no loss in picture quality or sound quality.  9 feet is a pretty good length.  Highly recommended and well worth the price.
B0000696I1|2.0|The third live-action movie of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  While the story of this is different from the previous two dealing with the foot along with the Shredder again.  This time the turtles end up going back to 15th Century Feudal Japan and many wonder if this is actually a nice way to take the turtles.  Although I have to say that I'm a little iffy on that idea, while one way it's good to see that they take the turtles in a different direction but at the same time I wonder as to why they would do like time travel for a turtles movie.  While I can say that the costumes for the turtles were good for the first two movies though in this one they don't seem to be that good but yet it's better than I expected for this movie.  While we go into the movie we see a side of Raph that most never though we'd see, as he befriends a young boy named Yoshi while the turtles are in a time of war in Japan.  Overall this movie may not be liked amongst some but I give it a 2.5 stars out of 5.
B003EYVY0E|2.0|No extended cuts that are aired regularly on TV and no lossless audio. The extras make it a tempting buy, but WB skimped on the crucial aspects of the \\"ultimate\\" editions this time
B00005JPMZ|3.0|It's been years since the last Ninja Turtles movie.  After 14 years after the last movie was done, we finally get a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie starring our favorite reptiles.  The story picks up years later after the third movie, while Leonardo is training to be a better leader leaving the others back in New York waiting for his return.  While Mikey, Donnie and Raph have to find some way to keep busy while Leo is off on his training that Splinter had sent him on, though there seems to be a rough patch for them as they try to keep the turtle family together.  Eventually Leo, makes his way back to his brothers just in time to face their possible threat to their brotherhood, eventually they learn how to act as a family to overcome the possibilities.<br /><br />While this is the first `animated' movie in the turtles franchise, although this technology wasn't in full use back in the day of the live action movies.  Visually the turtles look good, as well as the other characters, but one thing is that some areas don't seem to look to be all that great, that may be due to not being a big budget to work with.  Although this movie does reminisce, some qualities of the previous movies while at the same time it seems to keep true to the original source which is that of the Turtles comics.  If there's anything I can say is that with this movie they were able to do things that they may not have been able to do if they would've made this a live action movie.  As for the extras, they're good but not excellent though it helps give an idea on what wanted to be done as well as knowing why some things were taken out.  Overall I give this 3.5 stars out of 5.

B001HN69AY|3.0|[[ASIN:B003MQYR5S The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]This movie is relatively good for adults, not for children.  It is good for thinking, but at times hard to understand.  It is about Dr. Parnassus who makes a deal with the devil.  As a result the doctor lives for hundreds of years, supposedly, and introduces people to alternate realities.  Near the end of life, he made a deal that he would have to give the devil his daughter at the age of 18, he realizes that this was a mistake.  The good doctor thought that having a family, and living a long time, he got the better part of the deal.  He found out near the end of his life, that there is such a thing as living too long.
9889979942|5.0|I'm so glad copies of this amazing book are finally available locally so my friends can enjoy it too.  I've had my copy from overseas for over a year and I still look through it, both randomly just to see which photos I might have missed or to revisit favorites, and as a reference whenever I read news from China and want to see what the author wrote about and photographed from that area.    I am very impressed with the breadth of his observations and his lyrical descriptions.  I enjoyed the reading immensely.  When it comes to books of photographs I almost never read the text--the pictures usually say more than enough--but in this case I especially appreciated the concise doses of history, all of which would be mind numbing if not illustrative of the various provinces.  It's densely informative, but brief, so as not to overly interrupt or interfere with the images, and contains sufficient historical references pointing one to further reading if so desired.    There are occasional first-person accounts of Tom's adventures backpacking across that enormous country and you come to feel a closeness with his experience that enriches this incredible collection of photographs.    I highly recommend it!
0670021652|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir \\"Committed: A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage\\" begins when a U.S. Government Official detains Felipe, Elizabeth's boyfriend, at an American border crossing. They were given a choice: either get married or Felipe would never be allowed to enter the country again.<br />Since they were sentenced to marry Elizabeth decided it's time to confront her fears and make peace with the idea of matrimony before she jumped into it again.<br />For the next ten months, while traveling in Southeast Asia with Felipe, a man seventeen years her senior, Elizabeth researched, wrote and talked to others about the befuddling, vexing, contradictory yet stubbornly enduring institution of marriage.<br />With great wit, wisdom, insight and compassion Elizabeth, at age 37, researched the history of western monogamous marriage and examined the questions of compatibility, fidelity, risk and responsibility.<br />Her inspirational stories speak to our souls. I particularly resonated with Elizabeth and Felipe's flagging morale after six months of no movement on his immigration case. Separated from his gemstone and jewelry import business in America, Felipe was unable to earn money or make plans.<br />Feeling powerless and totally dependent on Elizabeth and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security<br />he became increasingly jittery, irritable and ominously tense. Elizabeth buried her own frustrations under a sunny demeanor. Their tension reached a peak on a twelve-hour bus ride through Laos to an archaeological site. Elizabeth's writing soars in her vivid descriptions of their conflict and the bus ride. Felipe became numb to the unbearable heat and the manic aggression and near collisions of the bus driver who almost dumped them over cliffs.<br />Trying to defuse the tension Elizabeth tried some practical strategies from her past to resolve the dispute. Felipe finally broke through their heated silence by taking her hand and suggesting they be careful. \\"Being careful\\" is their code for practicing preemptive conflict resolution. He explained how when people get tired fights happen. Choosing words carefully can arrest an argument before it begins.<br />Her insight, honesty and openness about their relationship is breathtaking.<br />Elizabeth's observation that most of us have a \\"default emotion\\" is fascinating. She shared how her Cambodian guide had a default emotion of quiet disapproval. After two days she could barely open her mouth she felt so foolish, pathetic and bloodless.<br />She uses the story of her own life to explore why many American's get married and divorced more often than any other nation. She says American society believes in two completely contradictory ideas about marriage. Both have their origins in ancient Greek and Hebrew thinking. From the Greeks we inherited our ideas about secular humanism, the sanctity of individual democracy, equality, personal liberty, scientific reason, intellectual freedom and open mindedness. From the Hebrews we inherited tribalism, faith, obedience and respect. The Hebrew credo is clannish, patriarchal, moralistic, ritualistic and suspicious of outsiders. The collective is more important than the individual, morality is more important than happiness and vows are inviolable. Hebrew thinking sees the world as a clear play between good and evil, right and wrong with God firmly on \\"our\\" side. There's no gray area. Elizabeth says American society is an amalgam of both. Our legal code and sense of fairness is mostly Greek and our moral code and sense of justice in mostly Hebrew.<br />\\"Committed\\" is a passionate, intelligent, important book written by a woman who knows suffering and redemption. Her story is our story in it's rich humanity, humor and zest for life.icing preemptive conflict resolution. He explained how when people get tired fights happen.

B001AQO3QA|1.0|No matter how in depth these blurays are, no matter how good the picture quality is.  100-125 dollars for 4 movies, 2 that are questionable quality at best, is ridiculous.  These studios needs to get a grip on their sanity and realize they aren't selling us gold.
159562015X|5.0|Firstly I should say I found the results of the test to be reassuring although not surprising (I'm a mature adult).   Secondly I like the \\"focus on the positive\\" aspect of the book's philosophy - that is: go with the strength, is a much more productive approach in my experience in business.    I took the test from the first edition of the book (Now, Discover your Strengths) four years ago, and just retook it from the more recent version of the book - Strengths Finder 2.0.   Results: THREE out of my 5 top strengths were the same.  Pretty good reliability it seems.    I recommend this to all who are interested in greater self-knowledge.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|This comment contains some spoilers.     If you like Melissa George then 2009's \\"Triangle\\" is a must see. She is on screen for about 90% of this 99-minute psychological horror feature. By far her most challenging role to date; she gets a lot of tight close-ups, a number of action sequences, and a character that is all over the map emotionally (must have been exhausting). The entire feature is told from her character's point-of-view (POV); and she does a good job of getting viewers to identify with her character.    Basically the story is weird mix of \\"Ghost Ship\\" (2002); \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" (2004), and \\"Groundhog Day\\" (1993); with a little bit of Julianne Moore's \\"Freedomland\\" (2006) thrown in for good measure. Even the POV twist was done recently in the minimalist Spanish film \\"Timecrimes\\"; although here it is more central to the plot.    But what makes the cobbled together mix of other movie elements special is more than the way they are mixed together or its intriguing POV twist. It is the introduction of Greek mythology as the story's primary thematic element. Specifically it is a retelling of the myth of Sisyphus, a man the gods had condemned to a hell of ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, at which time it would roll back to the bottom. The Gods had it in for Sisyphus who had been able to cheat death for a period through a deception. They thought with some justification that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor. There has been a long debate about whether it would have been better or worse for Sisyphus to know in advance that the rock was simply going to roll back down each time. Most jobs require a worker to spend their career at the same tasks, a fate just as absurd, but only tragic when they become conscious of the fact. Many believe that Sisyphus surmounts his fate by scorning it.  The concept has been extensively examined by existential thinkers.    Jess, George's character, is busy processing her fate during each cycle but just as she is almost fully clued in she goes to sleep and loses all but a vague sense of déjà vu about her surroundings.    My \\"speculative\\" read on the story is that the process started when she killed her autistic son in a moment of frustration. Regretting her act she made a bargain with death (symbolized by the sea gulls that appear at various times in the film). She will give up her life in exchange for being allowed to go back to the moment of her son's murder and prevent it. But after preventing the murder she tries to renege on the agreement, driving away with her son. Death then subjects her to a punishment in the tradition of Sisyphus.    This is a relatively low budget film ($12 Million) in which almost all the budget makes in onto the screen. There is excellent production design throughout the film and just enough special effects to complement the storyline without calling attention to themselves. Likewise there is enough gore to meet the genre's quota but not so much that it distracts from the basic story.    It is all about point-of-view and a good example for film students of the power this device can bring to a film if used effectively. Even if the story is not your \\"cup of tea\\", the film is worthwhile viewing just to expand your understanding of how to read films.    Finally, there is a subtle but pervasive homage to Stanley Kubrick's \\"The Shining\\" (1980). Not just the #237 on Jess's house and on the liner's stateroom door (this was the number of the haunted room in the Overlook Hotel) but the whole tone of the production; where the main set is actually more creepy because it is not dilapidated.    Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

B0001I562I|4.0|While made in the 80s, this is one of the best movies that Disney was able to produce in that era that was satisfying to kids as well as adults.  While I wasn't that old when the movie came out, but when I was able to watch it, it was one of the movies I could watch quite a bit while I was young.  As I got older I never knew if this movie was on DVD and when I was able to pick it up I did.  Upon watching this movie, it was just like when I remembered it and I feel that this movie definitely aged well, at least to me it did.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that has kids or just wanting to watch a movie from when they were growing up when I was.  Although that there's no special features with this movie but that don't hinder this movie whatsoever.  Overall I give this movie a 4 stars out of 5.
1591841666|2.0|This book was recommended to me by a guy I know who saw me struggling with my sales career. I do direct sales outside on the street, and the factors against me are huge (rejection, bad weather, crowds, energy levels, police, etc.).    Now, I read this book and I realized it was way too short and too simple to be practical for my needs. In this book, I'm basically being encouraged to think about quitting ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING that I'm not NUMBER ONE at and that I can't be NUMBER ONE at. That's fine, but where do I discover whether to quit or stay? This book gave me ZERO examples, but plenty of technical diagrams. And for someone like me, who has no idea who this author even is, I don't even know what he's NUMBER ONE at and I have no idea why I should narrow myself into a tiny niche just so I can be #1.    It sounds like it was written by a geek who wanted to think of something original just to make money. So instead of saying what all the other self help books write, that I should stay FOCUSED AND PERSISTENT on my goals, here I'm being told to QUIT on everything but my goals.       I do give some credit to this book, and he's why. I have read from the self help literature that advocates for a NEVER QUIT attitude, and again and again in my career, I've been rejected from HR departments, job interviews, etc. When I took up sales, I was quitting everything I had done in my past career, and I was happy that I did. I definitely was in a cul-de-sac, and now I know I am where I should be. I've gone through the anxiety/learning stages, and I think the Dip I'm in now is well-worth it.

B001TW69J4|5.0|This album continues to blow my mind.. so much material in one album!  I was going into the album expecting the typical prog/metal, and got anything but.  Sure, the same elements are combining (technical proficiency, meter changes, stylistic changes, etc etc), but this is not your Father's prog.  The more I listen the more I like it.  You will too.
0740785508|5.0|\\"Don't judge a book by it's cover\\" might be a cliche, but I find it quite relevant for this book. I own James Gurney's 2 books \\"Dinotopia\\" and have followed his blog and I can say that I am a fan of his work. However the cover on this book, to put it mildly, was not quite what I'd expect from him. Fortunately, thanks to my friend's persistence, I browsed this book at my local bookstore and was impressed by what I saw, so much so that I purchased a copy from Amazon. When I got the book, wow! I was even more impressed, it's one of the few art books that I have read with gusto from cover to cover.    James covers many topics and shows many illustrations to support the ideas. The balance of text and pictures was just right to keep me interested in reading the book. It's not a step by step book but more of conceptual reference book. He narrates the thought process behind the paintings and gives insightful advise on the topics covered.    I showed it to a friend of mine who is an accomplished illustrator in his own wright, and he was well impressed and inspired by this book. Highly recommended.
0385341008|5.0|It's been a while, I'm ashamed to say, since I read a book. This was the perfect one to start me reading again. It's so vivid. The characters are so well drawn, one can really see and feel who they are. And because it's told in letters, it's a very easy read.
B002VECLVO|5.0|Pairing Julianne Moore and Colin Firth in this 1960s drama is the best thing that could have happened for this story.  Colin Firth is a fine actor and this definitely is one of the best roles of his career.  His performance is so real and sincere that is tstunning and it echoes the feelings of people who have lost someone they truly loved once and could never recover from it.<br /><br />There is also a quiet pace of the film that makes it familiar and agreeing to the audience.  There is no rush to show one man's grief, his alianation from the world around him, loneliness that only in tiny spurs can be lifted by a dear friend who understands him as a human being, a mate and a countryman.  The exploration of possibility that we all live in our lonely world and perhaps only allow the people from the outside in.  Is it wrong for some of people to be that selective?  Film definitely manages to show that it definitely is not snobbish, sometimes it is a necessity from providing too much explanations and need to live life in its little moments, one at the time.<br /><br />This film will be an absolute classic one day.  I absolutely loved it.
0307577589|5.0|One of the best audibooks I have listened too!  I could NOT have sat down to read this one. I have a ''thing'' about being able to pronounce names and places when I read. So having the audio of this book made all those Swedish names easier to understand.  Now, my husband listened to this book first. And told me it was set in Sweden, involved murder, mystery and intrique with a great cast of characters. After one or two chapters I was hooked on the story of Blomkist  the reporter investigating a decades old mystery about a vanished family member and computer hacker extrodinaire Lisbeth Salander.  She is the toughest, female character to hit book pages in ages. She pulls no punches and is pretty darn fearless.  There are some VERY graphic scenes of violence through out the book and some may find these hard to take. However, if this does not bother you ( there is much similar stuff on prime time tv) you find your self drawn into the book and it's mysteries. It almost makes me want to go to Sweden and visit some of the towns. The author did a teriffic job of keeping just enough detail here to make it interesting without it turning into a mini-travelogue.  Book Two - Girl Who Started the Fire  goes at almost break neck speed and the last 1 hour of listening time - well I almost had to pull the car over and listen as the book was so exciting I got so caught up!  Now I am jsut waiting for book three ( when my hubby finishes it! Highly recommend this entire trilogy. I am so very sad that there will be only three books in the series; losing Larsson at such a relatively young age is a great loss to the book industry and it would have been wonderful to have another half-dozen or more of these thrilling characters.
B001IF9WJ6|5.0|Concert was staged in historic Petra, in Jordan, an over 2000 year old site (remember \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\"). The artists contributing were the likes of Andrea Bocelli, Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras to Sting(!), etc. This Blu-Ray is on my short-list of very favorite concerts. Fans of \\"The Three Tenors\\" shouldn't miss this one.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|Isn't it amazing how we play the entertainment card to make excuses for preposterous films? We as audiences will buy into a whole host of cinematic flaws as long as there are sights and sounds to keep us amused, and in all honesty, I don't know whether or not I mean that as a criticism. Maybe it's just what is. \\"Salt,\\" like so many summer action movies before it, is a fun thrill-a-minute stunt caper, and yet it possesses not a single shred of plausibility. It's one of those movies that gives you license to put your brain on autopilot; you're not supposed to question it, you're just supposed to enjoy it for what it is. I hope this isn't a copout on my part, considering all the other escapist summer films I've dismissed (\\"Eagle Eye,\\" the \\"Transformers\\" films, \\"The A-Team\\"). The fact that it's a spy thriller may have something to do with why it works. Tales of international intrigue involving secret agents are generally successful.    The plot: Trusted CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused by a Russian defector of secretly being a sleeper agent for the KGB, Russia's foremost internal security organization. He also says she will be involved in a plot to assassinate the President of Russia, who will be in New York City attending the funeral of the American Vice President. Although she denies the defector's claims, she realizes that she will be held against her will, which will endanger the life of her German husband, a spider scientist (a plot point that isn't as inconsequential as it might seem). Using every trick in the book, Salt escapes headquarters and goes on the run, claiming that she's out to clear her name. Pursuing her are Agents Winter (Liev Shreiber) and Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor); the former is willing to believe her innocence while the latter is highly suspicious.    One of the film's most ridiculous yet clever story points is an elaborate decades-old scheme by the Russian government to brainwash children into being KGB agents. Their goal: Raisethem to blend in, have them infiltrate the United States, and then let them bide their time until X Day, an operation that will plunge the country into nuclear war with the rest of the world. You'd be hard pressed to find a better sinister plot in a James Bond film, with or without the silly gadgets and gizmos built into wristwatches and ball-point pens. What does any of this have to do with Evelyn Salt? Wouldn't you like to know? Let's just say that, whatever her association, she gets to take part in many death-defying stunts, including impressive acrobatic leaps from the tops of semi trucks and gas tankers, all moving along at average freeway speeds.    Stories like this require a plot twist or two, and you'll get them both in \\"Salt.\\" I will say that, given the formulaic nature of spy thrillers, the twists aren't all that surprising - one is, in fact, so predictable that I could tell it was coming as early as the first ten minutes. But what this movie lacks in surprises it more than makes up for in sheer action spectacle, aided greatly by decent casting choices. Jolie, still in her prime, has been amazingly versatile, with credits as diverse as \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,\\" \\"Changeling,\\" \\"A Mighty Heart,\\" and \\"Wanted\\" to her name; it's always a good sign when an actor can convincingly touch you deeply in one movie and get your heart pounding in another. Schreiber and Ejiofor play fairly generic roles, but in all fairness, they do the best with what little they're given.    The only disappointment is Salt's husband, Mike Krause (August Diehl), who's featured so infrequently that I couldn't bring myself to care about him. This is bad because he is an important character, not merely because of his field of study, but also because of his emotional ties to Salt. Flashback sequences showing the two together should have been enough, but for me, something was missing. Maybe it was just a matter of too little screen time; had he been more actively involved, had he been givenmore dialogue, something substantial could have developed. As it is, I don't think anything of great importance would have been lost if this character had been altogether removed. Let the spider thing work itself in differently.    We need another mindless action film about as much as we need another reality show. But if they absolutely have to be made, then \\"Salt\\" is a good indicator of what they should be like. Yes, it's silly from start to finish. Yes, it doesn't bother with anything that's even remotely realistic. But boy, it certainly knows how to keep an audience entertained. The action is plentiful. The mystery is engaging. The characters are well-played. The suspense is palpable. It's a lot of fun. And here I go again, sliding that entertainment card from out my sleeve, slipping into a fairly weak hand. Are we too easily amused? Movies like this are enjoyable distractions, but I shudder to think this is all we have left when it comes to summer popcorn flicks. As is the case with real salt, too much isn't good for you - just a pinch will do.
B003L20ICE|2.0|We see a marriage based upon artificial insemination, penile prosthetics and butch/femme role-playing. We see a family where the kids want a father, the mothers are attracted to male bodies, and one of them has repeated sex with a man. In short, we see half-baked imitations of the real thing, with everyone yearning for the one element that can make them whole: the opposite sex, and not just more of the same.<br /><br />Obviously, that wasn't the filmmakers' intention. They wanted to give us an arms-open portrait of an unconventional family, and send the Worthy Message that gay parents are the same as any other parents. I rather doubt that, and my skepticism is not allayed by the casting of two straight actresses in the lead roles. (&#34;The inauthenticity&#34;!). Casting actual lesbians would have been braver and more honest, but the results would have been too real for a mainstream audience, and the film's cozy message of equivalence would have been a tougher sell. In any case, by showing us a gay couple pretending to be straight, and straight actresses pretending to be gay, the film subverts its agenda at every turn.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I loved Avatar on the big screen, and I loved it just as much on DVD. The quality is also superb.
030726999X|5.0|Make sure you have this book BEFORE you finish the second book.  You will want to continue reading this wonderful page turner.
B000001GQB|5.0|This is a modern orchestra with big modern sound, so it is not \\"authentic.\\" But I have never heard more stirring performances of these Mozart symphonies. I listen to the stately, majestic opening of the 39th under Bohm and my petty worldly problems fall away.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|Star Trek season 2 is a great season.  Trouble with Tribbles is a great episode as are others.  It's easy to see that the show was running out of steam near the end of the season.  The season is full of sword fighting, Nazis and Romans Gladiators.  The series is still exciting, humorous and lots of fun.  William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley are a great cast.  Brings back lots of memories.
B002UNMW7O|2.0|I liked the original Boondock Saints well enough. It didn't thrill me as it did some other viewers but I liked its quirkiness. I liked the cock-eyed lead duo and their sort of stumbling into their situations. Willem Dafoe as a gay police detective was also a nice touch. But in chapter 2 the writer director Troy Duffy seems to have gotten everything wrong.     He screwed up his main characters. They almost seem to be lampooning themselves. And I don't know if I've ever seen a movie that failed almost entirely due to bad casting. I don't recall who casted this, but he/she should be banned from further outings. This may be the worst casting of any movie I've ever seen of this stature. Virtually every character sucked. Even Clifton Collins, who I've liked in many of his roles, was just plain wrong here. The character was wrong and he didn't seem to know how to play him. The detective Greenly character, played by Bob Marley (No. Not that Bob Marley) was the only one I cared for.    I didn't care much for the story either. It lacked the naive charm of the original. This I found to be much meaner in spirit and the humor just didn't hit the right notes.     I know there are fans of the first out there who will love this installment but for my money this missed the mark by a mile.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|I love this watch and this brand! Outstanding time and looks! I am right handed, but I ordered this watch because of, looks, brand, craftsmanship, and the crown is on the other side so it doesn't dig into the back of my hand. If you are looking for a GREAT watch, this is the one! You will be very glad you got this one! When you get this watch, there is no need to thank me, I just tell it the way it is! Thank you Invicta, masterful watch!
