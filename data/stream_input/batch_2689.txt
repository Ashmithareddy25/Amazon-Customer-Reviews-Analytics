B004XWLN20|5.0|I missed most of the seasons of Smallville but when it was shown on tv I just had to watch.  Then the complete series was available and I bought it. thank you
0307878937|5.0|This novel could easily have slipped into the improbable, but the author avoided that and instead showed situations in which the characters acted authentically.
B005HERFPC|3.0|could this tin man be speice 8472 that voyager encountered in Delta quarte? it always bothers me when star trek overlaps its plots
B0095MVOMC|1.0|I'm so glad I started reading the reviews before it finish downloading.  for a while my kindle fire wouldn't turn on.....but now its fine. I had to keep turning it on and off until it started right.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love it it is very helpful to know how much you have must have app love it so much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is cute funny and fun to play! recommend for all. the one thing I would change though is the point of view is sometimes hard.
0812975219|4.0|I would have given the book 5 stars but there were some grammatical and syntax errors that bothered me. I guess I am used to editors who fix that kind of thing. But maybe that's not a good thing, maybe language irregularities are the way a language grows, so what one person calls an error another could call progress. But hey, don't we need some kind of standard, I mean where is the stability?<br /><br />Aha - that is one of the issues this book tackles - the randomness of events  that shakes us up. We expect the the world to be rational, that there are reasons for things and if we don't know the reason someone, usually Google or wikipedia does know.<br />Ah, but there you would be wrong, there are irrational things, random unforseeable events that happen more often than you think, events that affect us and we have to react to them. These are the kind of things I have always been thinking about, how we make decisions, how much of what happens to us we can control and what role luck or chance plays. Turns out that all these years that I have thinking about this and writing about them in my private journal, others have been producing books and getting PHd's, writing about this stuff and calling them theories and fitting them into existing categories of economics, mathematics, psychology and others I can't think of at the moment. See, if I was more motivated I could be writing these books instead of reviewing them on Amazon and Goodreads.<br />In conclusion, I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in learning about how others see the world There are certain conclusions and insights which really can shine a beacon on the irrationality that surrounds us all. For example - how is success measured, by results or by the process?<br />The most important insight I gleaned from this book, I think , is not to congratulate yourself too much for success, or berate yourself too much on failure - there is more randomness than you think. Just do what you think is right and proper for your life and loved ones, hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
B0063IH60K|4.0|At first I thought this was just like the average Solitaire game that you can play on most systems, but this one has the capability of giving you a winning deal (which doesn't guarantee you'll win--it still takes some skill) And has the capability of playing live games with people from all over the world. Be prepared though, the live games are FAST, only being around 1.30 - 2.30 minutes long.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I bought this for my wife, who absolutely loves this show. As it turns out, most of my neighbors are watching it too. So the whole neighborhood will benefit from this purchase.
B00B769XB8|5.0|Definitely enjoyed this movie in 3D that is a well written addition to this Fairy Tail!  You can't miss on this one!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's really nice to be able to check the temperature and humidity before I go out to work in the yard.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This puzzle is fun but a challenge for me as I can't find what I should do very fast.  It makes me think which is good.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is challenging as I haven't learned how to match them.  I really liked the Barnyard Mahjong and can do it quite well.<br />I think I will learn to like this one as well when I get faster in finding the different designs faster.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|I like it but it has some problems like with the blemish remover it gets so blurry to the point it looks like carp
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So much fun and highly addictive!! I can't wait for more levels to be released! This is the perfect way to wind down after a busy day.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|This is a great film, but alas, the audio is all in Japanese. Been looking for a copy for a long time and bought it a bitr impulsively; Though I expected a DVD to at least have English dubs as a secondary audio.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Classic Beatles. I was looking for fun, family friendly music for a road trip and my boys- 6,3, and 1- loved this CD. Of course, my husband and I do too. Classics everyone should know.
B000093BDX|5.0|Classic Beach Boys. I was looking for fun, family friendly music for a road trip and my boys- 6,3, and 1- loved this CD. Of course, my husband and I do too. Classics everyone should know.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Laughing on one page, crying a few pages later, I loved every minute of reading THE DUCHESS WAR.<br />Thank you Courney Milan, I can hardly wait for book 2!
B006FE7PT4|5.0|I love this movie, and when I heard the Reel Heroes editions were coming to the states they were all in Steelbooks. I love Kick-Ass so I wanted it to add to my collection and I assumed this was also a steelbook. Since we didn't get Kick-Ass with this cover I ordered it to match my other ones. I received it and I was wrong. Its in a regular bluray case with a slipcover. I should have made sure before my purchase But decided to write this for others thinking the same thing.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love mahjong it is a great game and I love the different levels it has. I am so glad to be able to play.
B0016KJKIG|5.0|It is exactly what I wanted! I completely wore out my original one and was surprised to find a replacement at such a low price!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Learn by watching,is very important.  It is easier to learn if we watch first and then experience it. In that way<br />The learning process would be more meaningful.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|Simply the Very Best WWII Movie Ever Made. What more needs to be said? Excellent acting at all levels, plot, location, title, set, costume, research, etc. It really is the very best WWII movie ever made. All thumbs up.
B0029LCJJS|1.0|In the very first scene Henry VIII's uncle (!!!!), the English ambassador to Urbino, is assassinated by a group of French soldiers.  That pretty much tells you what you need to know.  This series is less historical than &#34;A Knight's Tale&#34;, without an eighth of the wit.
B0009A40ES|4.0|The 1980's were full of named-dropping, pretentious behavior, and overt overspending, much of it on credit cards, and Mary Harron's film version of Bret Easton Ellis' novel illustrates it all beautifully. Christian Bale is perfect as the Armani and Rolex loving Patrick Bateman, who just happens to enjoy carving up people as much as he loves wearing his Oyster Perpetual Date Just Roley. Bale's sneering, self-absorbed yuppie is a great villain with a great body to boot, and the Supporting Cast of Josh Lucas, Jared Leto, and Justin Theroux are first-rate. Poor Chloe Sevigny pines for her crazy Boss, while Reese Witherspoon brings her standard vapidity to the role of Bateman's fiance. Much of the sex and violence of the book are truncated, but there is still plenty here. \\"American Psycho\\" manages to be funny, grotesque, and strange - just like the 1980's.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Not as complicated as other Gaiman novels but still very captivating.  A quick but engaging summer read. Would definitely recommend.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This show is full of beautiful cinematography and great plot direction.  I look forward to owning this series on DVD.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I definitely had a more difficult time following this book. From the who is it? to the where is that? I was kind of lost. Maybe because I am so far ahead of the television version.  I enjoyed it still but not as much as the three of the series that went before this one.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book is one of the best that I have read in a long time and I read a lot of books.  Great insight into the thinking of a German fighter pilot during WWII.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Enjoyed everything about this book.  The personal stories are compelling but perhaps the most important messages for me wer about compassion and not making preconceived notions about those who have been labelled as &#34;enemies&#34;.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My daughter and I love this game. It is a great brain game for kids!  We would recommend it to all!
B00COMLLX2|3.0|Not as good as some software pinball games I've played on my computer, but it's ok as a distraction on my Kindle Fire.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this season, I could watch these characters interact forever. The season starts strong and continues to deliver. I care more for when they practice law tho then anything else lol.
B00D6M86RS|2.0|Not any better than the free pinball that comes with Windows.  The game doesn't progress or save.  The controls are simple, but not really accurate.  It implies that there are several &#34;machines&#34;, but all you get is &#34;Avengers.&#34;
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Thought it was fitting and it was. Not the perfect movie but everything is reenacted well enough for a movie that we can all connect to it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Extremely fun and makes you think. Not too challenging and you should be able to work out all the puzzles without paper.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Had to give Season 3 of Downton Abbey a 5 star rating. It is a hands down winner . Love the storyline and cast.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was well written and I encourage you to read this one! Its bittersweet and I enjoyed it from start to finish.
B002M87V0A|5.0|Great music, funny characters, and a bit of a moral.  The time period lends authenticity.  Enduring classic, it never gets old :)
B005QYKD4I|5.0|I love this movie I would watch it over and over again! !!! it has everything you want to see in a movie.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The book tries to explore how habits are formed and how can we change it. If applied in life it may change life. The examples given are very good.  There is saying old habits die hard, the book explains why.  I will try to apply things mentioned in the book and update my review stay tuned.<br /><br />If you like freeknomics, the upside of rationality you may like this book.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great cast. Far better than 90% of the crap on network TV. Great production value. Solid story lines. Must see.
B000NJXG6S|5.0|always loved the show could not stop watching once I received these all discs worked and were all packaged together no complaints
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The game is awesome. there isn't much bad things to say about it. It's worth the money. It's a good time worthy game. If you like short mystery type games, you will love this. It is absolutely fun. I'm glad I spent the $2. ONLY problem, is how short it is. I think about it as more of a movie type game, just with a lot of puzzles.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This film is a example of many broken homes in America, where the dad is an alcoholic and his wife and children leave. But what most don't see is the chance for the children to break out of that cycle, and succeed. Warrior will not disappoint you.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is a very addictive! It could perhaps be a bit more challenging than it is. I have  managed to advance a lot through it. It is a good game  to play while going to the restroom
B00CATSONE|5.0|Nicely written biography of the greatest scientist and inventor of 20th Century. The book includes many interesting facts and names.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is so much fun if you like solitaire. From funny setting to the hilarious commentators this game packs a punch and never leaves you bored!
B005LAIGOQ|1.0|Radcliffe has been looking for work that will proves that he can do something other than Harry Potter.  He made a poor choice with the C Class horror flick.  The movie drags and then dies without a satisfactory ending.  Radcliffe still looks, talks, and acts like Harry Potter, just with a lot less direction and support to make him shine.  A solid C Class performance.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Same as subject. I like playing it with the kids as it teaches key levels of reasoning. I would recommend and look forward to new levels
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am definitely a &#34;paper person&#34; and have bought many books in both the paper format, as well as the Kindle edition - so I can still read on the go or when I have a few minutes to kill.  I also love the ability to download samples of books to read before committing to buy the book - to get an idea of whether or not it's something you will like.  My only complaint would be that I strongly feel there should be some kind of discount for purchasing Kindle book editions of other books that paper copies have already been purchased - but that's just my opinion.  As far as the app goes, it's great.  I have used it on multiple versions of Motorola Droid phones and the app runs smoothly, and it is extremely rare to encounter any problems in usage.
B000W198QY|5.0|Loved the songs on the album<br />Truly acoustic soul<br />One of my very favorite artists<br />I recommend this album to everyone
B001G9F9IW|5.0|This is probably one of the two greatest Woody Allen movies ever made, showcasing Woody Allen's latest contribution to the field of comedy.<br /><br />The story traces the lives of two women with peculiarly different personalities; one engaged to be married and searching for a place to reside and the other, being more adventurous, finding herself engaging in a love triangle with an Italian artist and his estranged wife, she being the inspiration behind the rekindling and maintenance of their relationship. However, when she decides to leave the love triangle, the relationship between both husband and wife characteristically begins to fall apart again.<br /><br />The story devised by Woody is engrossing and captivating and immerses you in a totally mesmeric world that is fascinating and entertaining. Without a doubt one of Woody Allen's finest achievements to date.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have been playing the card game ever since it came out and have played many video game versions as well. Simply put this is the best of both worlds. You get a story based campaign that is superior to any released before along with a faithful card game experience right down to opening some booster packs for a sealed deck tournament! If you have never played Magic the Gathering before this game is for you. It's tutorials are great for first time players and in no time at all you will be ready for any challenger you meet. To us veteran planeswalkers we finally have our \\"paper crack\\" in a video game format that allows us to take a ton of cards on the road for playing against friends without adding wear to our favorite tournament card decks. You hit a homerun this time Wizards of the Coast, keep them coming!!!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|How perfect a movie this is...and that it finally gave Steven Spielberg the cred he had been due for so long is even better...well before [[ASIN:B008CBZX7E Saving Private Ryan]] and [[ASIN:B00C1BU7V8 Lincoln]]. (Did you know Spielberg doubted himself, and actually tried to pass off the director's chair to Martin Scorsese, Sydney Pollack and Roman Polanski?)<br /><br />Of course it's more than that: it is not just Spielberg who deserves all the credit, but there is indeed so much credit he does deserve:<br />...It's the powerhouse book by Thomas Keneally called [[ASIN:B002VHI8MM Schindler's Ark]].<br />...It's the decision to do it in black and white (save for the girl in red, an idea that came to him when one of the actual camp survivors told the director a story about a four-year old girl shot before his eyes).<br />...It is the sensational acting, led of course by Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley.<br />...It is the powerful musical score created by John Williams, including a terrific performance by Itzhak Perlman.<br />...It is the crisp, period-inspired and stark realism photography of cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, who worked without a storyboard.<br />...It is the brilliant eye of production designer Allan Starski, whose job it was to darken or lighten the sets so that the actors would not recede into the backdrops (costumes too were addressed in this manner).<br />...And finally, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, let us not forget that it is due to the REAL Oskar Schindler, who did indeed save more than twelve hundred lives by employing them in his factories. Schindler, who died in 1974 in poverty brought about by his liquidating everything he had in order to \\"employ\\" his mostly Polish-Jewish workers. He was a man who had begun the war as a relatively amoral businessman who knew how to \\"work\\" the German war machine to profit himself, but eventually found himself a conscience, and did something so simple that no one else seemed to really think of it.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|Sitting on the edge of my seat for a lot of this movie! I love scary movies,and this was the ticket.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|This book is like Blade Runner meets Seven.  It has the future set that any technophile will love, merged with a warped murder mystery that delights the twisted part of ourselves and makes us ask, &#34;What would we do?&#34;.
B003G4W49C|5.0|How have I never read this book before!  It was great! I don't normally re-read books, but a few have made me do so.  I re-read this one within a month which is VERY rare for me, but a testament to how great this book is!
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Well I actually don't really mention anything about what happens in the book, just my thoughts and feelings so every one is still surprised!<br /><br />By now, we all know and love Gideon and Eva..<br />We know about their screwed up pasts and all the mistakes they keep making…<br /><br />In this book they seem to grow…<br />Events, words and rumours that would of started world war 3 in the past are looked upon, talked about and worked out like adults.<br /><br />So I’m not going to sit here and write about the actually story.. I’m just going to express my feelings and thoughts.<br /><br />In saying that.. I loved this book!<br />There was A LOT OF SEX though.<br />Like A LOT<br />At times I skimmed some of it….<br /><br />I KNOW I KNOW … I can hear you yelling BUT KELLIE! THAT’S WHY WE LOVE THEM!<br /><br />And I agree… but I wanted answers… so the sooner I got to the end of the book the sooner I got my answers… Don’t worry before the next is out in November I will re-read and take my time with it.<br /><br />We all know that Sylvia Day has signed a deal for 5 books.<br />So as I mentioned at the 100% status update,<br />I REALLY don’t understand why so many people are<br />A - bagging the shhh out of this book.<br />B – Aren’t happy with the ending?<br /><br />Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but some reviews have been HARSH, especially on Amazon.<br /><br />I mean REALLY??!<br /><br />We aren’t going to have everything answered until the 5th book! Where is the fun in that?<br />We are going to have even more questions in the 4th book!<br /><br />I liked the way it ended.. Yes I have questions…but it ended with a kinda half HEA.. they ended with their relationship solid… FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER! can’t we be happy with that?<br /><br />We just get enjoy the ups and downs of Eva, Gideon and Carey and wish that Sylvia will write Corrine Giroux out of it..<br /><br />And really…<br />I’m happy with that!<br />Bring on November!ovember!
B007IV1E2W|4.0|Great to watch if you are looking for the oddity of a story line!<br />Highly recommended whoever created this many years ago should be proud!
B007N0REX6|5.0|Slash and myles Kennedy are great together. This is a must! Listen to Anastasia and u will want this CD!
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|My family loves this game (I  haven't got to play it much) . I hear alot of laughter when they are play it!
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|I enjoy watching the Die Hard franchise, this story stretches the bounds of credibility so I'm happy that I watched it at home instead of in the theaters and saved money.
B007IV11PM|4.0|Love the not knowing which way the plot will turn! Though I loved season 4's doctor, season 5 doctor grows on  you.
B009CF3P7E|4.0|If you don't want junk, then don't require text submissions<br />Ferri simul labore quo te, vix mutat liber et. Qui ipsum integre id, mel ad quod persequeris,
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I love the Stargate SG1 series and spin offs Atlantis and SGU. Atlantis' first season is suspenseful, with a lot of twists and turns as the Stargate explorers venture into the Pegasus galaxy with not enough power to go back home, in the Milky way galaxy.  The Atlantis teams meet the humans of the galaxy making some new friends and some enemies. A new and horrifying enemy... who prey on humans, who are their food source. The Wraith suck the life out of a human, turns them old and then they die. Its a great show with a pretty much great cast.  The Wraith harvest the galaxy like a rancher harvests his cattle.  Except the team from Atlantis has woken all the wraith at once not a small portion of them that should have risen.  Too many wraith not enough humans to feed on. See how the team survive in this strange new galaxy with the technology and the city of the first human race &#34;the gatebuilders or the ancients&#34;thousands of years old.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|I tried to download this game onto my device, for some reason, it can never seem to be download. I hate it so much. I guess this is what happens when something is free.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|originally I downloaded this game for my nephew, I don't ever play games,  but I opened it up to make sure it worked and was instantly addicted! essentially its the same thing as temple run just cute. :)
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it. Fun read. Too many references to count. Perfect for nerds and geeks everywhere. Recommended for anyone who has ever played a videogame, watched a movie, or done anything involving pop culture of the past 40 years.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the greatest PBS series. Once you start watching you can't stop. Brings alive the human dynamics of commoners and royalty in jolly old England.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|a big 0!!! thats how I rate this!! It had filthy language (most people think nothing of) but it was stupid. It had a massive overdose of blood and the way white people treated the black people was very much exaggerated that I am surprised this film even was released! It was NOT WORTH EVEN 5 CENTS AND I WANT MY $5 BACK!!
B00C7D3TRO|3.0|but not my favorite FOB album.  It is a bit more poppy than the previous albums for my taste.  It's not bad, but it seems less inventive than previous albums.
B0000009XP|5.0|Buddy Guy's \\"Stone Crazy\\" must be one of the most _passionate_ blues albums ever recorded.  Every track is a full-on workout, in which Buddy lets his guitar grind, wail and cry.  His first few albums were restrained, in that he was not allowed to turn up the amp, and he has said since that \\"some people like\\" that clean tone, but he does not.<br /><br />Finally, by the time this album was recorded, he was allowed to play in the studio the same way he played live.  Some would say that he played too much, that his timing was sloppy and that he needed to calm down.  I say that he'd already done that and it was about time for the great man to let the dogs out.  On \\"Stone Crazy\\" he did.  All the way out.  What a rip-roaring album of fret-flailing fun and neck-strangling blues ferocity.  Long may Buddy Guy reign.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Plain and simple, this book is for anyone who eats. Thorough and well-written, Moss has gained access to the food industry's  most damning facts and revelations. The only ones who buy into the fantasy of \\"healthy food in a package\\" are the giant corporations.  Supermarkets are lined with products solely designed to deliver profits before nutrition.<br />I considered myself fairly knowledgeable about food, and I'm not foolish enough to have ever thought that processed foods were good for us...I just had no idea how bad, how absolutely indifferent and soulless the food business was.<br />But knowledge is power-- read the book and be armed to battle for your life and health.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game starts off easy then gets harder as you move along. Lots of fun and challenging. Wish there were more levels.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The mixture of the western, science fiction, amazing characters, everything is the best. Joss Whedon has never let me down.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Its a good cartoon to watch with the family. The cartoon becomes better because of the minions, they are hilarious.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I think the new format is not as clean as the old format.  Was easier to see the weather at a glance before.  Maybe this one will be better as I use it more.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is great. I am ready for season 4! My only complaint is that it wasn't long enough. I do not want to give any spoilers away in my review, so it is hard to give too much detail. Great acting and the story line just continues to develop as the family tries to find their place in modern times.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoy historical fiction and this was a great read. I learned so much about that time period while enjoying the story.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|This movie is ok if you have nothing better to do. I personally wish we had waited for it to come out on prime, but I am glad we did not pay $12 a person to see it at the movie. Most, if not all, the funny parts are seen in the trailer. It has a happy ending though, so of you need something new to watch this might be a decent choice.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|It's the kind of imagination I had as a child.  Full of excitement, wonder, bad guys and a happy ending with lots of laughs from start to finish.  It would have been 5 stars if the profanity would have been left out.  There's no need for it and children spouting 4 letter words is not funny nor shocking.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|This show brings back some great memories! Watching the first episode I noticed they changed the Walsh's house. Also noticed how little Tori Spelling was in the show the first few episodes. It's a little dated but still a quality show I enjoy watching!
B0012TWRAO|3.0|I'm not sure what type of manufacturing process they use, but it seems every item I get from RAM mount with a ball on it has poor finishing on it.  The base of the ball always seems crude and it looks like the finish is damaged.<br /><br />Other than that, this item serves its intended purpose.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great time passer.  I like games that make me think.  I also like not having a timer that I have to beat.
B00846REIS|5.0|It is so much better then 50 shades. I can't wait until book 4 comes out this series is amazing and a must read
B002W2AD60|4.0|good melodies, production, sound, energy.<br /><br />uli roth's guitar work is pretty awesome at times.<br /><br />recommended if you like judas priest, heaven n hell era black sabbath,<br />hendrix, progressive rock. :)
B006AZZPCM|5.0|downloads video so I can watch it when there is no Internet connection. Love it! A must down load for tablets owners.
0307895505|4.0|I bought this for my boyfriend's eighteenth birthday. He will love it. I was very surprised with how fast this item shipped.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I've used yahoo's free email for a number of years. Over the past 6 months, there's been numerous times my email won't load or yahoo isn't available. In addition, the screen is more and more cluttered with ads. Not cool!
B00005KHJR|5.0|The Wicker Man is a cult classic, and left a considerable impression on me when I saw it at a young age. Since then I had scoured stores in my town for a copy of the film, continually being let down. First, there was the 2006 remake, an absolutely horrendous piece of garbage. Second, as I soon learned, the movie was released in an edited and re-arranged American cut as well. I originally bought one of the American cuts, thinking it was the original I had seen as a kid. Boy, was I ever wrong. Luckily, I was able to find this beautiful box set, that includes both the re-arranged American version, with a very interesting documentary bonus feature, and the full Director's cut on a separate disc. Here, at last, is the version of The Wicker Man that I remember from my childhood, with all of the pagan philosophy, cultural musical numbers, sexuality, and mysticism that I remember. For those who are fans of the original, there is no better version of The Wicker Man available than this 2-disc Wicker Box Set.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I'm a 3D Nut! I've loved 3D since I was a kid in the late 1950's. Adding this film to my collection was the right choice for me! Simply stated, it has a good wholesome story (with a twist I might add), is exciting, and most important - it was visually stunning in 3D. You can't go wrong getting this one!
B00BB67UNW|5.0|Both Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe do an excellent job.  Very suspenseful to the very end. A very good thriller. I highly recommend this move.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Even more so than the first book, A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings opens up the world of A Song of Ice and Fire deeper into this amazing story, and expands these characters and their motivations as their paths lead them towards their eventual destinies. Although I have watched the show, I feel often that I'm not reading the same story, but an alternate and usually better version of it, and this book has quite a bit more difference than I noticed reading the first, and by the end felt like I really missed a lot of the author's work just from what I saw on the series. So, if you're just watching and you really like it, do yourself a favor and pick up the books...I can't even tell you how much I find myself filling in the gaps for friends and family. My Kindle copy is absolutely full of highlighting and notes, and the X-Ray feature is SO helpful to keep track of a story with so many characters and similar names (however, I will also note that there are more than a few dumb mistakes so trust your instincts).  There's just no way watching alone does this work justice, but I must say the same for the show as it is another layer of sorts to the full model, so read and watch and thoroughly enjoy this world that never ceases to amaze.
B00AEBB86A|5.0|I love this movie.  Great action and acting. This role of Bob Lee Swagger is made for Mark Wahlberg. I've recommended this movie to several people.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|This movie is worth watching. It's funny, spicy, and romantic. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. Will watch again anytime.
B002APU580|5.0|Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen are amazing in this version of Pride & Prejudice.  The best ever.  I highly recommend this film to everyone. A+
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly provided an enjoyable,  gripping, entertaining group of characters that one looked forward to see how they continued to grow, mesh and interact with each other.
B004132HZS|5.0|Item was exactly as described. Shipping was in short order. Price was affordable considering origonal source (BBC). I shall enjoy these DVDS for years to come.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|This is exactly the type of book that the character, Richard Castle, on the TV show CASTLE, would write.  The characters in this story mirror the characters on the TV show.  Nikki Heat is a detective and she is stuck working with a magazine writer.  The book is fast-paced and full of action, just like the TV show.  The two main characters work together, with a growing sexual tension, to solve the murder mystery.  If you like the TV show, CASTLE, you will enjoy reading this book.
B00CFA222M|1.0|Hard to think of when the last time was that I saw such a bad movie -- poorly written, uninteresting, waste of time, waste of brain space
B0034G4P94|5.0|This was a phenomenal movie. When the trailer came out for it I thought it was another cliche brother fighting brother movie but it turned out to be so much more than that. It is the struggle of a family that goes through what so many of us do not. The heartache and struggle from all 3 characters' perspectives is truly moving.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, for me personally, I felt the most compassion for the father who reminds us that the decisions we choose to make can end up becoming some of the biggest regrets in our lives. He tries so hard to fix his mistakes but it's too late. It's a reminder that should never take our loved ones for granted whether it's our kids, our parents, our siblings, or our friends.<br /><br />My only complaint for this movie, yes I have one, is that I wish the characters were drawn out more but I understand why they weren't seeing as the movie runs almost 2 1/2 hours as it is. A complaint I initially had was the ending which left things up in the air, but now that I think about it it seems more fitting the way it was.<br /><br />Excellent movie that brought me to tears and will certainly be watched by me again.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Really got into this movie - kept my interest - Maggie Smith provided a great performance as usual. Wish it had been longer.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I can usually finish a good book in a few days at the most- this book was just boring in parts- and took me over a long & agonizing week to complete. I appreciate the unexpected turns, but the space in between was too long and tedious. I never stop reading a book, but thought about it several times while reading this book. I'd have to encourage thriller readers to definitely pass on this book- not a page turner and somewhat predictable.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|Couldn't get into it - Gives us background on how the wizard came to Oz - shows how the wicked witch( who later persecuted Dorothy ) developed into the evil witch she was.
8866131105|5.0|I have always received exceptional quality from Moleskine. This product is no less in quality than any of their other products. The daily planner is very useful to jot down appointments (even by the hour), to-do's, or reminders in general. You have plenty of space compared to other planners which are only weekly or monthly. As a student, I can appreciate the amount of space provided to write down anything from assignments or projects to meetings (or even just a 'record' keeper for a day or such). I do believe there exists a larger model (size A4), but this is more convenient to take anywhere (though A4 is nice for a desk planner, and plenty of space to write in it).<br />I would say that this is the preferable type of planner to those interested in daily planners.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|ok so lets just start a running tab of things that was awesome about this movie.<br /><br />1. Main character's hands glowed and not just for light<br />2. big honkin space guns!!! red space laser guns!!!<br />3. big giant morphing animal!!!<br />4. outstanding movie altogether the story line was great they couldnt have found a better group of actors and actresses to play their respective parts this was an amazing movie!!! thank you amazon
B0055PGUYU|5.0|It's my first review on Amazon and this book just compels me to do that. Because it practically changed how I view the world, the people around me and myself. It brought my understanding of the world as I know it to a whole different level. I feel empowered and encouraged that the most deeply entrenched habits can be changed by employing the right strategies and by cultivating the right mindsets. The power of change can then spread out from self to the society at large. The effect is so powerful that can make a nation, change a man's life, or earn a company handsome profits. I know the lessons I learned through this book will carry me further and make me a better person in my life.
0064430227|5.0|I chose this one because I loved it as a child and have the DVD version, which I use in my classroom. I always like to have the actual book to go with the DVD when possible.

0385495323|4.0|I didn't expect this book to be this good. It covers evolution of cryptography in a very engaging way. It starts with the earliest forms of codes which were, letter to letter  word to word substitutions and How they were decoded by crypto-analysts. Which in turn, forced cryptographers to make more stronger codes and thus, this game of coding and decoding begun. In this process, author also included a lot of interesting anecdotes from history  which suggested importance of cryptography through the history.  At the end of the book, I was able to understand why present day encryption is the way it is. More importantly, it got me interested in internet security which otherwise I would have just taken from granted.<br /><br />At the end of the book it includes some puzzles for you solve ( I have not tried them yet .. but I'll soon )
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|An excellently written work examining the improbability of the existence of God or gods from a highly scientific viewpoint.  The book goes on to incorporate principles of evolution and natural selection to explain why humans \\"need\\" religion and why we look at the world the ways in which we do.  Although religion is discredited, it is done so systematically and not in an insulting manner.  A must-read for atheists, agnostics, skeptical or just plain open-minded religious readers.
B00D8RYV52|1.0|This app worked the first few hours then stopped. I called Amazon after trying to trouble shot it they refunded my money. I was told that this app was having trouble back in June and had been taken off the market for awhile. Just put back up and it was actting up again.

B001BANK32|5.0|I was into every second of this book! Dam I was at the Overlook Hotel. I thought the movie was great before I read this book and sorry to say it didn't hold a candle.  \\"I am his biggest fan!\\" . Lol
B0025WX2YW|5.0|We really enjoyed the Tudors Season 2! It was pretty accurate to the story. The costume design is very good!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|great its like decay but not scary. I hope the makers of this do a better game that is more interactive and make more items to find more visual to the player
B009GEDP26|5.0|I love Castle. It doesn't take itself too seriously and that's one of the best things about it.  I like that it doesn't focus just on the Castle character. Everyone in the core cast is essential and that's what makes it such a great show.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love to play this game with my friends and family! Especially because I move a lot so I can still keep in contact with old friends and make new ones with just this one FREE app!:) Although it can be a tiny bit slow at times, it is fun for all ages!
B000U0O9FM|4.0|Saw the movie in the theater in 2000, own the DVD and had been meaning to read the book since. Great voice, interesting narrative structure, compelling plot and exciting characters. Definitely a good summer read. Excellent &#34;Afterward&#34;.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the fact that the points you get you are able to donate them to charities. I also like that you can track your weather.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I'm a Gaiman fan. I had high hopes for this book and it delivered. A beautiful story all the way around with classic Gaiman imagery. I'd rather not list any sort of spoiler.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It is a fun game.  You will get addicted so quickly that you might as well skip the plans for your day.  Duh
B00BEIYM42|4.0|\\"Unfinished Song\\" (2013 release from the UK where it showed as \\"Song For Marion\\"; 93 min.) brings the story of Marion (played by Vanessa Redgrave) and Arthur (played by Terence Stamp), a long-time married couple where Marion is the cheerful and eternally optimistic wife and Arthur is the grumpy old husband (when asked if he is enjoying himself, Arthur grumbles \\"you know how I feel about enjoying things!\\"). Marion attends the local community center to sing in a choir of similar seniors. Then one day Marion collapses and we learn that she has terminal cancer (the doctor tells her \\"eat all the chips and ice cream you want!\\"). In a parallel storyline, we see Arthur also struggling mightly in his relationship with his son Steve and 8 yr. old granddaughter Jennifer. Meanwhile, the choir, lead by a young woman named Elizabeth (played by Gemma Arterton), is getting ready for the singing competition they have entered. At this point we are about 30 min. into the movie. How will things turn out for Marion and Arthur? Can Arthur mend the fences with his son? Will the choir break through in the singing competition? To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all turs out.<br /><br />Several comments: first and foremost, I was struck by the similarities in themes between this movie and \\"Quartet\\", the Dustin Hoffman-directed British movie from late last year: the soothing, if not healing, powers of both music and companionship for elderly folks. Second, you will see a side of Vanessa Redgrave that you have not seen before (not to mention that Redgrave, now in her mid-70s, remains as active as ever). Third, THE break-out performance of the movie for me is Gemma Arterton, who reminds me of a British version of Anna Kendrick. Arterton is an up-and-coming talent, the last of which we have not yet seen (she was most recently in \\"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\\" and later this year she'll be in \\"Byzantium\\").<br /><br />The screening I saw this at here in my local art-house theatre in Cincinnati this weekend was packed, heavily tilting towards seniors, I might add, and they absolutely loved this movie, laughing out loud many time (for example, when the choir started doing the 'robot dance') and even giving an applause as the end credits started to roll. This is a fine movie for sure, but for me lacking a bit in originality. That said, if you loved \\"Quartet\\", you cannot go wrong with \\"Unfinished Song\\".eening I saw this at here in my local art-house theatre in Cincinnati this weekend was packed, heavily tilting towards seniors, I might add, and they absolutely loved this movie, laughing out loud many time (for example, when the choir started doing the 'robot dance') and even giving an applause as the end credits started to roll.

B0027J4SKA|5.0|I saw Melody Gardot performing on &#34;Later, with Jools Holland&#34; the other day and was blown away by her performance and the song she was singing.  I immediately purchased &#34;My One And Only Thrill&#34; and was not disappointed.  I don't know how I've missed hearing her over the last few years, but better late than never!  Her songs sound as if they have always existed, and her performances are flawless.  The music is easy-going but still a challenge to the listener.  Clever lyrics and beautiful melodies, with arrangements that are perfect for the songs.  I can't wait to explore her other work.  Read her biography and you will be inspired by her triumph over serious injuries which still plague her, but don't keep her from expressing herself beautifully as a singer and songwriter.
B00BF124PC|4.0|I skipped this at the movies because I knew how it would end. But it's the journey not the ending ...
B0058W74UY|3.0|This program works, but it needs to have additional features.  It needs to be integrated with some web browsers since there is no way to play flash on an Android web browser.
B000002AGN|5.0|All music students should listen to this album.  Great composition,  great technique,  a great blend of all the necessary elements.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like Facebook, but their censorship policies have me very concerned.  If you are going to market yourself as a way for people to keep in touch, then let them do it.  Don't censor speech that is not politically correct.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing!!!!! It was very heart warming and I loved the ending it was simply fantastic I recommend it to everybody
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season of Downton Abbey has it all, Intrigue, suspense, life & death moments, medical drama and laughter.  It was a very compelling series and I could stop watching it until I had watched all of the episodes.
034580404X|5.0|I am almost through reading the first of three in the series and I am glued to this book. I cannot put it down. I am so glad that I purchased it. I also want to thank Amazon for such excellent customer service. It was a pleasure doing business with you. I appreciated the fact that you kept me updated as to when the books were being mailed and when they were due to arrive.<br /><br />Thank you!
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|this game has nice graphics, easy (so far) to use controls, and is fun to play - I didn't see or really look for directions as game play was fairly easy to figure out - there was no instant tutorial level like you find in many games. I like that it has goals / achievements to work towards - I like games with a point to playing them. it somewhat reminds me of donkeykong country but is much easier so far! I have had no problems so far with levels working properly or game continuing - this downloaded and is working great on my first gen kindle. I would pay for this game but happier I got it as the faotd! thanks amazon!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is a great name its perfect for children because it help the understand real friendship and how to live life and life lessons too
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|No permissions seems like a miracle, so thanks to the creators! Got this as the FAOTD.<br />As for the game, it is very fast paced. There is a running character on top and  you must manage inventory & matches to keep him going. Game play is as short as a single run or as long as your battery lasts. There are items to purchase & upgrade. Tile matching is not anything I've run across yet either. I'm many levels in and still discovering new techniques & tools. There is humor thrown into the hints too. Graphics are old-school and basic. Sound and music volume can be changed separately under settings option. There is also an option to clear all game data. Wish it would have more to upgrade. This will definitely stay on my 1st gen KF. Recommended to older kids & up.
B001AFF25W|5.0|This was an amazing book, and I have been successfully applying its principles in the week or so since I've read it. The author has a succinct way of putting things, and uses humour to good effect. It is a self- help book that really helps!
B008J34466|5.0|Every song is great. Some of her best work including slow sons and party songs too. Her talent and range was very impressive.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Works almost as well as the web...radar works better.  Overall it does the job well.<br />It was recommended to me, and I would recommend it.
B00846REIS|2.0|I just don't get all the hype with this one. Of course I read FSOG, yes I loved it. But this seemed like a poor cheap rip off. I didn't get the chemistry btwn Eva & Gideon and their relationship seemed forced. And a dream rapist...whaaaat?  Idk maybe it got better in the next book but at that price I wasn't willing to find out. For my money there are better, cheaper books out there.
0767817478|5.0|My relationship with this film is odd, and as mutated as the lizard himself. When I first saw it, I didn't care for it. Simply, it wasn't a Godzilla film, and this very well done creature was not Godzilla/Gojira. Godzilla is a kaiju. In the Toho Films tradition, that's a critter of immense size and inexplicable abilities whose life is all about breaking stuff. Lots of stuff. But this Godzilla is an innocent. He causes damage only when looking for food or seeking a place to make his (?) nest. That's not a kaiju. As Mathew Broderick says in the film, \\"he's just an animal.\\"<br /><br />About a year after I saw it, I happened upon the DVD playing in a Sam's Club, and, to my surprise, found myself smiling. I bought the DVD, and the more I watch it, the more I love it. It's a delightful film, rich with terrific performances by a lovable cast. Jean Reno is classic as Philippe Roche, an \\"insurance agent\\" who is really much more. Hank Azaria is worth the ticket price all by himself as news photographer \\"Animal.\\" Maria Pitillo is funny and enchanting. We also have the brilliant Michael Lerner as \\"Mayor Ebert\\" (get it?) and the ever reliable Kevin Dunn as the colonel in charge of operations. Everyone does a great job, and Broderick himself plays Nick Tatopoulos (the last name is taken from the visual effects director) as moody and difficult to approach, a sort of ultra geek AKA \\"the worm guy,\\" for his work with earthworms in nuclear environments. Usually he's warm and cuddly; not until \\"The Producers\\" remake did we see an edgy side to him. He's a riot.<br /><br />Visually, despite some opinions to the contrary by no less a film luminary than Roger Ebert, the effects are magnificent. Ebert's problem with rain allegedly hiding flaws is dead wrong. Of course, Mr. Ebert, whom I loved and respected, was often clueless about visual effects; he called \\"The Last Airbender's\\" visuals \\"atrocious.\\" In fact, they were groundbreaking. Likewise, here, the rain isn't designed to cover flaws,but to provide mood and depth. It actually complicates the work, requiring reflections and specular highlights in the renderings. Great work by Patrick Tatoupoulos, which is nothing unusual. He also did the visual work in \\"Pitch Black,\\" the \\"Underworld\\" films, \\"Stargate,\\" \\"I Am Legend,\\" and many more. He's first-rate.<br /><br />The ticket here is to  enjoy the movie for what it is, not excoriate it for what it isn't. Godzilla's necessary demise is painful to watch, a testament to the effects work. Acting is charming, musical score (except for the ridiculous rap over the final credits) is often moving. Is \\"Godzilla\\" a perfect movie? Heck, no. It has a couple of plot holes and misdirected moments big enough for the \\"lizzid\\" to lay eggs in. Some sequences go a bit too long, yes. But overall it's a hoot, a kindly kinda kaiju with a sense of humor, and one that rewards repeated viewings with big grins and even an occasional lump in the throat. It deserves much better than it has received.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I just love this App.  The tiles are very easy to read.  The grids are all different and very challenging.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I've seen this before, still awesome!  Glad it is still out there so I can watch it again and again.
0385523394|5.0|I really liked this book.  It is written like a series of sequential articles rather than a narrative with true character development, but it still provides interesting insights into the rhythm of institutional prison life, with its mind-numbing bureaucracy and its mash-up of humanity trying to adapt or deal with incarceration.  It is told from Kerman's pov, and thus her reactions to life in prison make up the bulk of the book, but she still provides a lot of food for thought about our prisons and the people who live in them.<br /><br />I came to the book through the Netflix mini-series, and the only reason I watched that was because of Kate Mulgrew who is \\"Red\\", but I found myself completely drawn in by the series story line and the lives of the characters in the movie, in spite of the fact the show was much, MUCH more shockingly graphic than anything I typically enjoy (used tampon sandwich for starters).  After the mind-blowing ending of the first season of the mini-series, I had to read the book to see whether something like that incident really happened.  The answer is thankfully no.  There are no deaths in this book, no overt sex, no pregnancy drama, no drug-running drama, no brutal attacks, and so on.<br /><br />It is difficult for many people to have compassion for people who are in prison or to care about their living conditions since they \\"made their bed\\", but I think books that remind us of our common humanity with \\"others\\" are important and worth reading, and so I added a star to the book's rating.<br /><br />Recommended.  And if you are put off by the graphic nature of the mini-series, this book is a \\"safe\\" read.  If you are hoping to read graphic descriptions of events portrayed in the mini-series, you will be disappointed.
1781162646|5.0|A very good book.  Suspenseful and good reading.  Enjoyed it very much.  Would recommend it to anyone.  I love Stephen KIng.
B000007UXS|2.0|I'll make it clear right now that I love this album and Radiohead and all, and wanted to have this on vinyl. Sadly, when I received my record, it was badly warped, and almost unplayable. I don't blame Amazon or anything, this was most likely the fault of storage or such, perhaps caused by laying the records flat rather than upright. Either way, I'm left with a record I can't really play, unless I can find a way to fix it. Price was very cheep however, and all in all the whole thing was well executed. Shipping was prompt and good and all. I guess this serves as a cautionary tale of buying records online.
B009POHHR6|5.0|Very enjoyable story and not what you would expect. Very well thought out ideas of Superman dealing with not being human.
0385523394|2.0|Although I very much wanted to like this book, as I've been for quite some time interested in the penal system, and (while I've read several books on mens' experiences) this was the first I'd read from a woman's perspective. However, as a couple of other reviewers have stated, on the whole, I found myself disappointed with the author's rather smug attitude.<br /><br />I did like her descriptions (and, often, compassion) about her friends/fellow inmates, but felt she often had to go out of her way to point out how she was better educated than them (and blonde! and pretty! and with a good, tight body, thanks to all that runnin', to boot!), and goodness knows, homegirl would have found it anathema to, like, ever sit down and watch some telly, or read a book not on a Seven Sisters' approved reading list. I mean, yes, I was aware that this was meant to be a story of how she was tooootally out of her element, but her frequent sentiments on how 'different' she was, and how she essentially didn't belong there came off as frustrating to me, like she couldn't ultimately take responsibility for her crime (something suggested in the fact that she blamed Nora, in the end, for getting her into the mess in the first place, rather than realizing it was utterly and totally her doing to have accepted the mission, as it were, from Nora to begin with). Also, in a few infuriating bits, she points out how the racist counselors she has favour her thanks to her hair colour and pale skin, and while I understand that maybe she could have, in some respects, seen this as a good thing while she was incarcerated, she never really takes the time out to note how deplorable this really is.<br /><br />Sooo...I could go on, but should probably wrap this up--basically, I guess I just wished to convey to everyone that even if you're deeply interested in the subject in general and compassionate towards prisoners, Ms. Kerman might try your nerves. In the end, to me, this book felt a lot more like the author putting her hipster 'street cred' out there (whatever lackluster protests she may make otherwise) and telling us a kind of funny story about a really, really unpleasant year (that has ultimately worked out rather well for her, thanks to the book deal, television program, and the rest) than any major or heartfelt step towards actually changing things for the better (again, whatever lackluster points she may make about wanting to do such). I'd give it a C-, and even then, only because the topic is one that's of particular interest to me. Otherwise, I'd suggest you leave it alone.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|That's what it's meant to be made for, and this super cheap and super edition version makes it worth it.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I'm definitely part tiger Mom. Albeit a westernized version for sure. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it in 24 hours.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|And I have a ton of those physics books.  It probably goes with Mr. Ferguson's accent more than his education because there are a lot a lot a lot of those British cosmology physicists.  However I skipped the shebang, and the pictures are available nowhere else, and look like the pictures from most biographies.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I kept reading as this book takes control of you and won't let go until<br />the end.  Read in two sittings.  That's the kind of book I like!

B0052FG750|1.0|When I purchased this, the ad said remastered. When I got it listened to them and the songs were different than the original recordings.When I read the back of the box set, it said the albums were remixed.I only bought this because I do not have any of the doors albums on cd. I did not want the remixed cds which is why I never got the Perception box set. Eventually, I was able to pick up all of the cds individually that were the original recordings that were not remixed.I recomend to anyone that wants the original doors cds without the remixes that doesn't mind buying used cds because that is the only way you can get these right now. Look at the copyright date on the cd. If the date is 1990 or older it is the original. If it is any other date after 1991 it was remixed. Also look on the back of the cd or box set If it says remastered it is the original.However, if it says remixed then it is remixed.If you don't mind the remixed doors albums, I will say this box set is a good value. But for me, this was not what I wanted.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|gotta love the Star Wars Legos!!!  we've been waiting a while to order this set because of the price but it's well worth for the size and number of minifigs
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so well written. The characters are believable, both the kids and the adults. The book wouldn't have been so heartbreaking if you didn't buy into their separate lives. The author character living in Amsterdam was a pretty convenient villain, but I think it shows how the death of one very close to you can take almost any toll.<br />Is there a happy ending or does life just move on? A little bit of both, I think.<br />Okay?<br />Okay.

B007C12RDS|4.0|This is a lovely series about a young girl (a sort of female version of John-Boy in The Waltons) who is sent to the nearby larger city to work for her Postmistress cousin.  It portrays an idealized vision of country life, so some may find it too unrealistic, but the actors are excellent:  in addition to the lovely young actress who plays the lead, Laura, the cast is populated with wonderful character actors.  Brendan Coyle, who has become popular through Downton Abbey is one of the leads and does a terrific job portraying Laura's father.
B00DDTQE1Y|5.0|that is finaly on amazon appstore, i waited it for 1 month to see that on here, thank you dev, i bought it insantly as I promised
B005544TRQ|5.0|I enjoy this show. It is in the vein of some of the best lawyer shows I've watched, but it's even more than that. The witty dialogue and interesting characters make this show great.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This has always been a great app up until this last update. Now it freezes constantly, the buttons frequently don't work, and the layout is considerably less user friendly. It's unfortunate and I hope they fix it soon. Also, the forecast is sometimes different on my kindle from on my phone for the same area.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|The book is eye-opening for sure.  I found parts of it did not really add value to the story so I found myself skimming over parts here and there.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is really fun it is challenging and helps you use your brain really fun puzzle game. you SHOULD get this game
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love every thing about the show.  The actors all play their parts very well.  The pecking order of thing is very evident.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game rocks there is two different modes creative and survival in creative mode you can build what ever you want my friend built my school in creative. In survival you have to kill robots and other people but you have to get your own food and supplies and make your own tools
B00008DDRX|5.0|a real Steve McQueen, with old fashioned mores, and pure hard racing. The circuit is the old one, with the real French country roads.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|Wouldn't work correctly on my kindle. Graphics was not very good. Slow at loading. It would probably be a good game if it didn't have the glitches.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Great book about what we all search for in our lives.  It should be read by all students in high school.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is simply a very nice show that gets better as it goes along and the characters become established. For fans of Downton Abbey, one of the main characters is the actor who plays Mr. Bates. He did this show right before going to Downton Abbey. The show is about the poor town of Lark Rise and the wealthier town of Candleford which is almost 8 miles away and where the Post Office is located. There are many interesting characters in both towns who have their own struggles, predjudices, loves and opinions. It is a great family show that teaches life lessons. I don't like reality shows and  I am grateful to Amazon and PBS for broadcasting these wonderful shows that can no longer be found on network t.v.<br />I highly recommend this show.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I could not put this book down.  The author leads the reader deeper and deeper in to the mystery that is Nate, the young character.  The characters are all interesting, and this book holds your attention.  It delves into problems with mankind without being preachy.  Mystery, magic and oh what possibilities the universe has to offer unfolds in this fun story.  Who to trust, what to believe, is it possible?  Read the book and decide for yourself.  It's fiction, but what if... I found the book to be enticing and thought provoking!  I can't wait to see how much more Nate learns about his abilities, and if he truly can use his new found abilities for the greater good. If you like all things psychic, spiritual, time travel, reincarnation and other mystic phenomena, this story is for you.  Even if you are a skeptic, the book is simply enjoyable and well worth you time.
B00957T6X6|5.0|And with the possible exception of &#34;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever&#34; and the first &#34;Dragonlance&#34; series, maybe THE best.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|An amazing finish to perhaps the best fantasy series of all time. Brandon Sanderson carried on Jordan's legacy well, and though there were subtle differences, he tied it all up well. A very fitting ending to an epic series.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|everyone raved about &#34; The Help &#34;  this book is so much better - I'd like to see them make a movie
B005PK56TA|5.0|One of those shows that you say \\"Huh\\" and then five minutes later \\"oh my gosh!\\" Lots of twists. May cause whip lash
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|Purchased for my wife as she LOVES the movie!  It met all her expectations and then some. Deleted scenes are awesome!!
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Ellie Goulding went a little more darker than \\"Lights\\" and was able to pull it off. She is very sincere and lays her feelings out for everyone to see which makes \\"Halcyon\\" relatable to people like us who have gone through heartbreak. All the songs are beautiful but the one that gets me tearjerking is \\"Dead in the Water\\". You will not regret buying this!!!!!!
6305014140|5.0|I bought this on vhs years ago and have been trying to find a copy on dvd ever since. This is a great movie and what made me watch anime. The action is paced just right and I really can't find anything bad to say about this film.
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|This Despicable 2 is a wonderfully funny comeback to Despicable 1.  Love this movie.  I thought I was going to be disappointed.  Not at all.  The story line moved fast.  Loved the whole movie.  Come on Despicable 3!
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|Having decided to read the Jack Reacher books in chronological ( rather than date published ) order , this book was as good as The Enemy. The book was tense, well plotted and interesting in its description of a small town that relied expressly on a nearby military installation. Reacher in a semi civilian role was good - a fish somewhat out of water. The political angle was also good. (Must say though, that although Tom Cruise sufficed in &#34;One Shot&#34; he is not Jack Reacher!)
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I thought it would never end. Actually, turned it off and said I wasn't finishing it. Because I paid for it, I broke down and watched the end.  Not a redeeming second in the last hour.  Just pointless and painful.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|Didn't like this one at all.  Guess I'm not good at strategy games.  Frustrating, not very enjoyable in my humble opinion.
B0042ESTQW|4.0|For how much Garmin bike computers/GPS units cost, a protective case should be a small expense to pay for. This case fits my Edge 800 well. I bought another one for a riding buddy's Edge 810, and it fits that just as good. If there's one thing this could improve on, it's the rubber tabs covering the micro-SD card slot and the USB port - this could be a bit more snug fitting. That's a minor gripe though, and I'd recommend this case to anyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Really appreciate being able to get all the different Bible versions on this app.  A BIG plus it that it'll audibly read it for you also.  This helps in my home studies on pronunciation of hard to say names, places, etc.  Also has nice studies on prayer, fasting, family matters, etc. and links to Moody radios several daily radio programs.  Plans to read the Bible in a year and other great plans also included.  Great to have it available at any time!
B000059MEL|1.0|i guess i had very bad luck since it's a case of bad pressing. the right channel has noise all over the 2 lps.
0425263908|4.0|This is definitely a sexy story. All those reviews that say to read this if you liked 50 Shades are right. While the story line has several parallels to 50 Shades, I feel it is better written (as it should be since this isn't Day's debut). Day has developed characters who are evenly matched in both the strengths and the baggage they bring to the relationship. I can't wait to read the next 2 to learn more about where their passion (and their family and friends) take them!
B0091VTISO|5.0|If you watch this movie with the classic Schwarzenneger films in mind, you will be disappointed. This is in no way a sequel, prequel.... It IS, however, an amazing movie in and of itself! The characters interact well together and move the story line right along. I loved it!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I have played a ton of fb and kindle games based of movies and never been happy until now. With the storyline in there and having the famous mini games too. I can only say the game is quite epic.
B0026OR1UK|4.0|If you are a coach, teacher or anything this is a great book that you can apply to a lot of different parts of your life.  It makes you think on how your brain works. Great book!
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Lot's of surprises and good acting.  I had heard a lot of negative things about it, but enjoyed the movie myself and watched it twice.
B000LJ9ZWE|3.0|Movie was still as good as it was when it was released to theaters.<br />Great concept, great story line and<br />cast.<br />Almost too true in today's technological atmosphere.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat for this action packed adventure romance! The personalities of the characters were fantastic!
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Truly enjoyed this movie. Great plot and keeps you watching until the end. Liam Neeson is, as always, a terrific actor.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|For some reason my father loves westerns, so this was a classic for all of us to enjoy with him.  Thanks!
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|I did not get the movie as yet but when I saw it in the theater it was exciting and action packed, I like it when a movie has a little comedy in it and not all drama or action.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Yes, Clint Eastwood is an extremely talented actor, but I loved how this movie took a look @ how times have changed & the ROI of learning from others and actually caring @ our neighbors.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|I personally did not enjoy this movie but it would be fine for kids,  and if you like that kind of cartoon movie get it for the kids it will entertain them for an hour and a half.
B001EBWIUO|5.0|For some reason my father loves westerns, so this was a classic for all of us to enjoy with him.  Thanks!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I loved these books so much better than the 50 shades series. They are better written and the characters have more depth to them. I can't wait for the 4th book to come out and I wish they would make these books into a movie rather than the 50 shades!
B00B5FBQTS|3.0|I have the free version on my phone and you get an option to buy equipment for your team before each mission. The premium version its gone and i can only spend coins on potions and scrolls during the levels. Missing something or just lame version?
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is quite engaging and  I really love the graphics. This one gets a 4 star from me.<br />Well done!
B00AHHODH2|4.0|This is a very unique novel, filled with colourful characters and drama. While it may be classified as a sort of mystery, it is a soap opera, as well.<br /><br />The story revolves around the Gordonston area of Savannah. A popular neighborhood park is where many residents meet and walk their dogs. Within the neighbourhood is a close-knit group of women who does everything together. When one of the women dies of cancer, the dynamics of the group changes. People change, lines are crossed, secrets come to light.<br /><br />In fact, it seems there are many secrets and mysteries brewing in Gordonston. From financial problems to politics, questionable relationships to inappropriate conduct, there is a lot going on in this book.<br /><br />Duncan Whitehead has written an entertaining book with dark humour and drama, along with many twists and turns. This is a great summer read.
B001APM46W|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have heard in many, many years. George has a wonderful, versatile, sexy voice that he wraps around these diverse, sophisticated, modern/urban songs about love in the big city. Each song is its own mini-world, with varied musical influences, interesting instrumentals and lyrics that really tell each story clearly. Although different in sound and texture, all of the songs flow well together due to the common theme.<br /><br />It is unclear if this album received proper publicity at the time it was released, but I invite others to take this musical trip with George Michael. This is my 'go to' CD when I am happy, sad, etc. It has received extended play time in my car and in my home.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like those little minions there so cute and make me want to play more. You should get this game like I did!!!! #cool<br />(better than temple runs and subway surfers) :)&lt;3
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|Ok let's get started the ups , some good things are you can get tokens to spin and win prizes of sorts or u can exchange them for coins , u can collect coins and buy clothes jetpack s and more.. here are the downs it takes a while to get coins to buy stuff and u can only own 2 umm what's the thing well anyway u can only have 2special things at time and when u get new one u got to buy the old one again
B001HN690O|5.0|If you like Kung Fu Panda or movies like that this is excellent. It has a great story line and ends well.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|This sucks well the game doesn't, but when your supposed to earn coins it will still say that you have zero coins and you can't buy anything !! :(
1439127727|5.0|Book club I'm par of selected this book.  Glad we did.  Personalities, politics, and purposes blend with surprising outcomes.  If you like Presidential history, you'll like The President's Club.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game is so fun and challenging that it's fun for the whole family. My husband and I enjoy it as well as my 6 year old.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|This was the least expensive case I could find for my kindle and I really like it. It protects my kindle, is not overly bulky, and stands up to a lot of abuse.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|The set doesn't come with the regular Blu-ray, just the 3D disk.  Limits significantly the places we can play the movie. I don't think that was clear.  Very disappointed at the cost without all the formats.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Like Cut the Rope, Zepto Lab has another hit!  I love the little pudding characters.  Great puzzle game for killing time.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|I went into this movie with high hopes, and even higher expectations. An hour after the movie was over, I was still talking about it. I couldn't stop. The next morning, I mentioned it to a friend at BK when I went to pick up breakfast. Bar none, this has got to be the most FANTASTIC movie of its kind that I've ever seen (and, trust me, boys and girls, when it comes to giant monsters and giant robots, I've seen 'em ALL!). I grew up in the 70s and 80s. I saw all the Godzilla, Gamera, etc., movies. I watched Transformers, Voltron, UFO DiaApolon, Johnny Sokko, Ultraman, etc. If it had a giant monster in it, or a giant robot (or better, both!), I was THERE! This is every fan of either genre's wet dream come to the big screen. I already have plans to watch it, memorize it, and go see it again in the theater (maybe this time, in IMAX 3D ... ). My favorite part is (seen in previews first) of the Jaeger using a boat like a baseball bat. SPECTACULAR!<br />Some people have said that it's this or that, or the other thing. I'm telling you to judge for yourself. If I had paid attention to the 'mixed reviews' it got before release, I might not have gone to see it. I would have missed out on a fantastic time, and a spectacular movie. Granted, it's not deeply philosophical, and the plot is formulaic, but that's part of what makes it GREAT!<br />VERY IMPORTANT: Stay all the way through the credits. You will not regret it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great fun game for all ages. graphics are good and game is pretty much reality. try it you will love it
B0094D462M|5.0|One of the best movies of that era. One of my favorite and is on my top ten movies of all time
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This games is amazing but you should add the further and more of the past and you should add Greek and you can use the gods
B000X9ZERW|5.0|Awesome music and a great listen. Copied it to my iphone so I can listen to it all the time. Never get tired of it. Love all of his music. Highly recommend it. Great CD.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|NEMO'S REEF IS AN EXCELLENT GAME AND HELPS ME TO RELAX AND RELIEVE STRESS. WHAT I DON'T LIKE ARE THE PLAYERS WHO DISRESPECT THE RIGHTS OF OTHER PLAYERS BY STEALING MY PEARLS, SEEDS, THAT I'VE PLANTED AND THEN EARNING A PRIZE THAT IS RIGHTLY MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! THIS REVIEW HAS NOTHING WITH AMAZON.COM OR THEIR  EXCELLENT SERVICE AND PRODUCTS THAT THEY PROVIDE. IT IS ONLY MEANT TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE DISNEY GAMES CO AND VENT MY FUSTRATION!
B006362ZR6|5.0|Awesome music and a great listen. Copied it to my iphone so I can listen to it all the time. Never get tired of it. Love all of his music. Highly recommend it. Great CD.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I've been a Paramore fan for years, and despite losing two members, I think this is the best Paramore's ever been. There's been so much growth since Brand New Eyes and the album itself satisfies so many different musical genres. I really love the interludes, and almost every single song on the album is one of those songs you wouldn't be afraid to blast for the world to hear.<br /><br />I especially love Part II because I really feel like it's the perfect sequel to past songs, hence the name, but it's definitely one of my favorites. All of the songs have really great, relate-able lyrics as well, so I really commend the band for such great works.<br /><br />I'm sad to see so many that do not appreciate such an amazing change. Don't get me wrong, I own and love their other albums too, but I feel like things can only get better from here.
B002BW7A58|5.0|Awesome music and a great listen. Copied it to my iphone so I can listen to it all the time. Never get tired of it. Love all of his music. Highly recommend it. Great CD.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Some parts were boring but it was very interesting. I can't wait to read reached. A  Good  book for anyone.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|Awesome music and a great listen. Copied it to my iphone so I can listen to it all the time. Never get tired of it. Love all of his music. Highly recommend it. Great CD.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I love it nothing else to say but I am required to put so many words so this is talking up the space needed
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I felt an immediate connections with the characters in this novel.  Their lives and story were so very different from my own, yet I felt their pain and joy in a very authentic way.  Didn't want this one to end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a fun one for all ages...would recommend this game to anyone of any age...Fun Fun Fun...So glad they finally made it compatible for the kindle.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app so much!!!!!! It hardly gives me problems. It's extremely easy to use!!! And it's a great way to chat with friends!! And having a kindle fire doesn't allow me to use emojis, this app is great because it lets me use some!! I find myself constantly using this app. It allows me to easily keep in touch with people anytime!!! But u do need wifi, anyways this is my absolute favorite app ever!!!!!!!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What a gorgeous game. As others have said, very MYST-like. It's an intricate series of puzzle boxes, challenging enough to keep my interest throughout without making me want to throw my Kindle across the room in frustration. Not more than a couple of times, anyway. *g*
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My friends at school introduced me to this game I think it is better than candy crush my favorite game.
B00A1XIXM8|3.0|I prefer the previous two albums, but this one is pretty good too.  I'm a little disappointed with the F-bombs.  I think they've shown in the past they don't need to swear to make great albums.  Not bad though.  Not bad.
B005HSL626|4.0|Help on Amazon Kindle fire HD. It worked fine for few days... later it has been going thru some problems
0451228731|5.0|Suarez has created a near future world that instead of an Edward Snowden blowing the whistle on the fascist police state military-industrial complex, a billionaire decides to do something about it - by direct action. Wildly imaginative and terrifying. You won't know who are the good guys for a considerable number of pages and just like real life there are some on both sides of the conflict. Highly recommended.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My daughter likes how the person changes into cool characters (e.g., dragons).  It is challenging and she plays it frequently.
B00APYKXFS|3.0|Bullet storm games are ok. This one could use some variety in coloration. Changing the music automatically would be good to. Played better.  Played worse.
B0088W4YTK|4.0|good action great special effects sometimes a waining plot but still a great series<br />the new bad guys make it interesting
B001ANSSDC|5.0|at first it took a bit to get into his narrative, but once I got it, I could not put this book down!
B005IQ39AY|1.0|I haven't liked this from the first time I tried playing it. I'm kind of new at these games, but until now I've been able to figure them out. I'll keep trying, for a while anyway.
0955153077|4.0|good but the hard cover that protected it was partially broken, apart from that was one of my best purchases!
B008220BLG|5.0|This movie is really good. But of course, you can't take it too seriously! Watch for what it is and you'll enjoy!!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|But a little gory and scary for young elementary school or less. Lots of scenes with very little light makes it difficult to see. Good for family movie night, when choices for a fairly clean movie are limited
B00COGY2P2|5.0|A lot of fasted paced action typical of a Jack Reacher story line. Excellent character development that had you guessing until the final confrontation.
1452101248|5.0|And I own waaaaay too many cookbooks. This one has become my go-to book for delicious, healthy, exciting recipes. I have made about one third of the recipes so far and I'm excited to try the rest. Eggplant and mango with soba noodles sounds truly bizarre and is FABULOUS. I crave this dish. My fussy friends went went for second and third helpings and came back for leftovers. This is probably not a book for novice cooks. But it is worth learning the techniques to enjoy this food. It is really amazing.
B00785P2QC|3.0|A good game over all.  Seems that if you don't share info on Facebook it is really difficult to get ahead.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show - interesting characters. Show allows you to get emotionally invested with everyone. It's fun watching new technologies being introduced that correspond with the era like electricity and cars.
B00027JYLC|5.0|I learned of this flick 25 years ago while in college, forgot all about it till I came across class notes that mentioned this, everyone I share this with loves the story, a true classic and introduces a viewer to some of the most unique people of modern times!
B00985E3UG|4.0|Lots of interesting information in a bit more detail than I was up for. But I have recommended the book to others because it is such an indictment of the processed food industry.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Speaker for the Dead is a book completely different but exactly the same as Ender's Game. Orson Scott Card is incredible with words to be able to tell stories in such an intelligent, and heart wrenching way. I look forward to reading more of his books!
B00932A3SK|4.0|Not your typical Hollywood formulaic thriller.  The movie is subtitled in English, which prevented me from fully appreciating every detail of the movie.  I would need to watch it again to catch every detail, but I'm not sure it captured my interest enough to do so.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|You can expect the unexpected, the acting and writing are top notch, and I love seeing Albuquerque and the southwest!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I usually don't take the time to rate games...but this one is so good I decided it was worth it. I recommend it to anyone.
B00455IVHU|5.0|I could watch this a thousand times and not get enough! Babs is the best! And i didn't realize Bridges could be funny!
B00CHVJODE|5.0|The movie was fun. Anyone who does not like this movie is a loser<br />My whole family liked it and again if you didn't your a loser.
B005T87QCI|2.0|99 cent 7 dollars for all robots to be unlocked no other way to unlock them thats just greedy otherwise was sorta function,
1592537251|4.0|We live in a world that varies so fast!<br />It is very interesting  to write down our impression,our viewing of everything..<br />This book is a very good idea!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really addicting and I've spent hours playing but I'm currently having trouble connecting with my Facebook. If this could get fixed I would gladly change the 4 stars to 5 :)<br />THANKS FOR THE FIX :D NOW I CAN BRAG ABOUT MY HIGH SCORE AND HAVE MY FRIENDS TRY AND BEAT IT.. THEY NEVER WILL THOUGH -u-
B00DU74U74|3.0|I have seen the Twilight movies and have read the books as well.  I thought each movie got a little bit better with improved budgets. I enjoyed them, but I am more of 'True Blood' vampire fan. I don't think you have to like the 'Twilight' series to enjoy this movie.  It's completely different. I never heard of 'The Host' until I saw it out at the theaters.  I thought I'd wait to see it on dvd or instant streaming because I wasn't quite sure about it.  It was quite entertaining. There was some action, it was interesting, and the cast was pretty good.  Give it a try. There are plenty of adults in the movie, so I don't think it is just for teens. (I never go by who it's meant to entertain anyway.  If I want to see something, I just see it!)
B00127RAJY|4.0|It's good, the exercise aren't too difficult and it's got different stages you can do, so you can do what ever level you feel up to.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is fun and with no time limit I can play as long as I want. It is fun and free.....awesome.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore is the best rapper I have heard in 5+ years. Buy it. Some of the best songs are the ones that are not played on the radio all the time (Wing$, Same Love, White Walls, Ten Thousand Hours, etc.).
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is great for people who love animals and protecting the wild I love the animals they look real!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Pretty cool game. Easy to play and very entertaining. The graffics are spectacular and the theme of the game is exciting.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|This charging cable works as it is suppose to and the price is very low. Very much worth the money.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It was a very compelling book.  It was hard to read at some points because of the subject matter but it gave you a first hand look at the times.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is a great book for those of us who are introverts.  Despite what our culture tells us, it isn't a disease!  Should be required reading for all extroverts and especially for those who think introverts need to change.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read all his books and find his characters to be very engaging.  It kept my attention through out and I read it in 3 dayss
B0064X7FVE|2.0|It is purely laid out and confusing to use. I can see that they tried to make it better but it just hard to navigate.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This was a wonderful book I had downloaded on my Kindle.  It was a very fast read.  It allowed me a better understanding of this disease.  It was very well written.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|giving me lost of valuable knowledge. knowing the smart, unique, intellegent people around the world.<br />teaching me to listen and speak english
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is awesome.I play it for hours .you should really get it.it is great for kids around my age 8 of 9.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is an almost scary account of Alzheimer's because it is told from the view of the patient and it's easy to experience what the main character is feeling. It brought tears to my eyes more than once because it makes you realize how fragile life as we know it can be. My father-in-law, who lives with us, has dementia and this helps me to  understand what he must be going through, as I see the signs in him as they are described in the book. I read the book to understand this, so I can, hopefully, become a better caregiver. As with any terminal illness, I think it can be difficult as a caregiver to stop and realize exactly what the patient goes through, because you become wrapped up in just figuring out how to get through each day. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This game will keep you going! I like the game because it keeps you focus and wanting more. A must have game!!!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Absolutely great app with what you can remotely access your desktop and do whatever you want on your computer.<br />If you have problems with cropped or resized desktop, don't forget to go to the settings of the particular computer in the app and set the display to native resolution.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like how I can read and not have to download it and use my space. I like how I can read my books on my computer, tablet, and phone. The only thing I don't like it how I can not share my books. I feel I get more my money worth if other read it as well. But I understand it from the Amazons point as well, because if I share it less people will pay.
B00008DDRX|5.0|This is a film about racing for racing enthusiasts. I love the way it captures an era of racing and race drivers long gone. Perhaps the pounding heartbeat in the background and the absence of dialogue can feel a bit too much fore some, but personally I just love it.<br />If you want to get the feeling of racing before commercialism took over in the 80's and onwards, I can warmly recommend this film.
B00846REIS|5.0|I have a family and work full time. I was unable to put it down. With my family and work. I managed to finished the book in a week. I ended up staying up late every night because it was just that good. Cant wait to read the next one. When the book started I thought it was too much like 50 shades but then it got really good. It similar but its got its own twist.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is ok but the thing is it doesn't always work. So I would give it about 4 stars But it's a great game It's also very addictive game I hope you like my opinion.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Helpful and easy. I haven't had any issues with the product. It is nice to be able to know how much time I have left on my battery.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|This book does something extremely rare:  It ties together elements from every season of the show (as well as the TNG movies, even the bad ones!) into an interesting science fiction epic.  The author must be a true fan, but even better, he tells a great story about Data, his creator and Data's &#34;relatives&#34;.  It ends off on a good note, while leaving room for sequels which I can't wait to read.<br /><br />Any fan of ST:TNG has to read this book.  It'll bring back lots of great memories of the show, while changing your views on the character of Data.  It even addresses silly minor things you never noticed, like how Data never uses contractions when he talks.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Story is interesting and well told. The writing is high quality, and this is from someone who rarely reads anything less than 100 years old.
B00BMHFYVA|5.0|Every song on this album is fantastic, but especially &#34;Darkness in our Hearts&#34;, &#34;Don't Forget Who You are&#34; and &#34;Out of Control&#34;.
0374533555|5.0|This book is for someone who want to study both psychology and economics at the same time. However, it might be little hard, even though Kahneman tried hard to explain his theory as easy as he can, theory is still unfamiliar, and it is still the theory that received Nobel Prize.<br />Standard economics, which had made their basis on physics, is now accepting psychological theories. Behavioral economists proved that existing decision making process toward risk is wrong or imperfect. Human being, which reinterpreted through their experiment, only shows bounded rationality. However, it is too soon to evaluate that the behavioral economics had developed into highly completed theory, in the level of able to replace the standard economics' rational human theory. Rational human theory does not completely meet with reality, but it is still useful. Theory does not have to reflect the reality to be useful, it became useful when the theory can find the reason and solve the problem. Actually, as Kahneman had mentioned, market gives compensation for rational investment and punishment for irrational investment. However, people should pay attention to what behavioral economists are saying. It is one of the positive aspect of the behavioral economics, that it knows about human being's weakness. We can be wiser when we understand our weak point.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|why couldn't this series have caught on instead of 'TWILIGHT?&#34;  the adults and the dialogue make this movie fun. emma thompson has a field day onscreen.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I don't like this one at all.  I can't get out of the first room.  Its frustrating and it makes me mad. I just have to give up on it.
B00CDJNHH4|5.0|One of the best quality Blu-Ray remasters I've ever seen. I strongly recommend you watch the remastering featurette included on the Blu-Ray disk prior to watching the movie so you can have a greater appreciation for the improvements made to this version. I bought this after my VHS copy finally gave up the ghost. Coming from perhaps the worst picture to best was very jarring. It's like a completely different (and better) movie.
B005HSL626|5.0|It's fun and it keeps me alert as to not slice the bomb.  Its an eye- hand coordination  test for me.  I love it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is a great tool to be able to read the bible in the palm of my<br /><br />hand;as a Pastor is combinient
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love all the different puzzles it has for you to choose from.  Its not like you have to be doing the same one all the time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really good app.  It makes you think.  Some levels are really easy and a couple are pretty hard. I really enjoy it.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I've been a great fan of Hosseini's writing and I remember impatiently waiting for And the Mountains Echoed to come out. The book starts off promisingly, and is fast in the beginning, but sadly starts meandering during the later half. It jumps from here to there, leaving a lot of loose endings. The idea of narrated stories all suppposedly interconnected doesn't really appeal to me, maybe because it lacks perfect execution. You won't be staying up all night reading this one.
B008602KQI|5.0|This will keep you on the edge of your seat. More than that, Hunger Games is a great commentary on how we have become a reality tv obsessed nation. It definitely gives you pause to think.
0062220837|2.0|Firstly this review is not about the contents. If you know Neil Gaiman, then you probably know that this is one of his better stories, and thus very good indeed.  You may also know that the version fully illustrated by Charles Vess (ie the comic book) is probably the preferable edition, but that is a matter of taste - some people like illustrations, others prefer their imaginations.<br /><br />This review is about what you get if you pay your money for the signed limited 'gift' edition. The print run is 2000 copies with a number and signature. The book looks quite nice and is boxed. In the introduction Mr Gaiman says he wanted it to look like a much loved book from 1922. Superficially this is the case. However, William Morrow, the publishers, in their wisdom decided to make the book perfect bound. That is to say they, that while the book is hardcover, they have used a cheap paperback binding. The book may survive four or more readings, if you are lucky. You should not open it flat if you don't want it to fall apart. If you are lucky the glue won't splinter in 20 years even if you don't read it.<br /><br />What the publisher has done is assume that book collectors know nothing about books, and that collectors are willing to pay, quite a lot of money, for a badly and cheaply made book. It is not a matter of cost. Publishers like Subterranean Press, for example, regularly turn out signed, limited editions in smaller print runs, properly bound - sewn and in cloth - and at less cost to the purchaser. Why a big publisher like William Morrow cannot do this too is beyond me. I certainly will not purchase any other limited editions from them.<br /><br />Whether you like this edition or not will depend upon how much price gouging you can accept.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|One of the most profound movies I've ever seen. Beautiful cinematography and the story is beyond description.  I would recommend this movie to everyone I know.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's pretty okay. There were some levels that seemed not to have enough info. Despite that, I still enjoy playing. It's a little addictive. I'm looking forward to the other levels.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|Poorly acted, poorly directed, not much of a story...just a lot of yelling and over-talking. Would not recommend this to anyone.
B009EERZ1K|3.0|Daredevil director's cut is definitely a step above the regular theatrical version is it a blockbuster everyone wanted it to be ? No but as a lifelong fan of daredevil this version is worth watching and purchasing I wish it could have been better but as comic book movies go I don't think it's the stinker everyone makes it out to be daredevil fan's won't be too disappointed check it  out<br /><br />ter
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Before James Bond... there was Ian Fleming, Agent 17F of British Intelligence. The setting is World War Two, and the secret agent carries out a desperate mission to persuade a maverick French admiral to lend his fleet to the cause of stopping the Nazi war machine.<br /><br />Through detailed descriptions, a picture emerges of the weapons, ships and even fashions of the day. From the moment Agent Fleming commandeers an aircraft to seek out the hidden French fleet, the reader is plunged into an action tour de force with a real feel of the Second World War. Of particular interest is the experience of a bombing raid by the Germans. It is as if you are racing through the city and the explosions are going off all around you!<br /><br />There are some interesting comparisons and contrasts to be made between Agent 17F and his creation 007. Both are young, handsome agents, with a flamboyant lifestyle. However, Agent Fleming is a bit gruffer in demeanor, though still possessing undeniable charm.<br /><br />This book has everything you would expect from a Bond tale: action, explosions, sultry vixens, and ironic quips. Get to know the man behind the myth: Agent 17F is at your service...
B007IXWKUK|4.0|GOOD IF YOU WANT TO LIVE SOMEONE'S ELSE'S LIFE.BUT SOMEHOW I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN I GUESS IT REMINDS ME OF MY HUSBAND AND I WITHOUT THE EXAGGERATION.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 6 yr old is horse crazy so this game is perrect for her. I usually dont alloy games with in game purchases but this one an exception. Thank goodness for the ability to disable that. We play it together.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|well.. apart from the gross sound of the guys neck breaking its a cool game.. good game to play if u got a few minutes to kill or hours to kill.  the guys neck cracks &amp; breaks if u turn the vehicle over &amp; that sounds gross to me but i am sure others think its cool...
B0092S4WLY|5.0|A game of deduction, that gets really addictive. I really want to play more games like this one. Thank you for making it.
B008EKMB82|5.0|loved this novel about a slice of contemporary japanese culture told from the perspective of a bullied, isolated teenage girl.  Integrated are Buddhist teachings and way of life.
B00932A4XE|4.0|It was a good movie to relax with.  I loved the difference in pregnancies between the wife and daughter-in-law. Cameron Diaz was cute as usual.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun. Doesn't make you frustrated! I like it!<br />Would recommend to my friends that like this type of game!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down!  Anyone into this genre will like it.  Now, onto book two!
0761169431|5.0|My son saw this at Barnes & Noble, and wanted me to purchase it. I pulled up my Amazon App on my iPhone and scanned it, ordered it on the spot and got it w/in 4 days. Same condition as the bookstore and much cheaper!
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|played this for about 15 minutes and uninstalled it.  Just didn't think it was that fun.  Maybe if I was really bored...
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Everything in the movie is awesome.<br />It has everything. Comedy, Romance, Suspense.<br />It's a great movie from start to finish.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|Good acting, writing and directing all around. The film actually breathed and nothing was rushed. And who doesn't love a happy ending.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Good movie very violent.  Good acting by the three leads.  Some of the other acting toke me out of the movie.  Seemed like some of them were overacting.
B002DEI4NG|5.0|This is the best show ever - wish it hadn't gone off the air.  six more words required...really really reallY?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy this Wonder Series very much and I'm sure you will also. Just hope they don't discontinue the series for many years :)
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is beyond addicting.  It's so much fun.  It's not too hard and not too easy.  You can play for a few minutes, the levels go fast if you need a short time-filler, or you can play as long as you'd like.  The colors are pretty.  I do wish they stayed more vivid after they are connected.  It's really fun to play in the dark. Last night one of my dogs snuggled up to me and watched the lights and movement for several minutes before he yawned and fell asleep.  Highly recommended.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I have not listened to pop music for years, but not sure this is entirely in that genre.  The voice on this lady has excellent range, and she sings with such passion.  I can honestly say this is the best singer currently out there that I have been exposed to.  Great album, especially if you are going thru a rough breakup.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great Series! I watched it all in a span of three weeks. I wish that the last season was longer but it still is a great show!
1781162646|5.0|I've read over 40 of Stephen King's works so far and Joyland not only got my attention, I'd have to say that it has easily found its way into my Top 5 favorite Stephen King stories so far. Just about everything about this book is phenomenal from the characters to the setting to the storyline itself. This book is amazingly human and Stephen King does a marvelous job of putting readers into the mind and heart of the main character, Devin. I absolutely loved this book!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game you missions to do you get to buy vehicles and it like your life you get to kill people and have a gang you need to buy it seven $ worth it
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This Game Is Really Cool.<br />If You Like Any Of The Dungeon Hunter Apps This Is A Good One.<br />I Have Dungeon Hunter 2 But This Ones Better.
B004DMNT2W|4.0|Nice case for out video camera.  Easy to carry and makes me feel that the camera is safe.  Good price also.
B005N09L5C|2.0|Dark, plodding, boring with no explanation of what was going on. Read the book to better understand how prescient George Orwell was!
B0060AY6FO|4.0|This is a really good continuation of one of my favorite classics. James weaves a fun mystery around well known characters. I particularly enjoyed how she introduced characters from other Austen stories into the periphery.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Great movie, shows loyalty and unconditional love that we as humans do not always give.  This dog deserved so much more.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Continuing the saga of the Clifton Chronicles, this is another&#34;can't put it done&#34; book. I hated to finish it because now I have to wait for the next book. The characters are so believable and interesting. The continuing story line of all the families is engrossing.
B003AUFCVE|1.0|Product was damaged...vinyl was warped. We could not play it because of the condition it was in.  VERY VERY poor quality. Highly disappointed
B0036OP0QQ|5.0|I sang every word to every song upon as soon as this set arrived!!! I only wish it included the American Anthem:)
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Having read and studied history in dry history books through school, I found I could glean more of what it was really like to have lived during that era.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I have used Documents to Go for six years on Palm DX systems and Blackberry's using it for Microsoft Access database synchronization for a delivery route that the company I was working for at the time was very impressed with.  I don't miss the Microsoft Outlook app that was included with previous versions.<br /><br />I was happy to see they were back with a Kindle/Android app and I didn't even bother with the installed version because I have been a loyal customer of Dataviz and they have done very well when creating the app for previous as well as current portable data devices based on industry reviews. I did buy two copies from each app store.  One for Kindle Fire and one for my Android tablet making me legal.<br /><br />This is great for viewing PDF files (unlike other apps, this one will scale the fonts properly and quickly when increasing size) and Power Points. Works perfect when you need to view or show presentations on an HDTV.  There were some formatting problems discovered on Power Point presentations if you are using older file versions.  Tests using Office 2012 files were perfect.  Transitions didn't appear to be a problem.<br /><br />As with all Documents to Go products, this version will sync with your Windows computers by dragging and dropping files into the desktop folder.  It will work with Browser for Skydrive folder apps as well (if you download the file to your Kindle first).
1932735410|4.0|I used three books to study for the exam.  I believe that this is the best of them by far.  Without it, I would not have passed.  Note that a fair amount of project management experience is necessary to pass.  The book is well written and to the point.
B00785P2QC|3.0|So far I have enjoyed playing this game I just wish u could earn investments with easier and faster so I can build more.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|John Goodman played a good part, should have been in it more.. Denzel was good as well but movie was not that good
B001FVV2X2|5.0|So, while I know it's not returning, I am enjoying catching up on the series from the beginning. I missed episodes often enough not to understand some of the underlying story lines when they originally aired.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Love Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper together, they should do more movies together. Loved the story, should do a sequel. Loved the Philly stuff.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|My husband and I backtracked because we could not find season one until we remembered Amazon. So thank you we enjoyed Season 1 as much as season 2 thru 4. Looking forward to 5 and many more!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! Love the suspense of &quot;what comes next&quot;.  Great App! Thanks One of the best apps I've came across lately!
B001C34HUS|5.0|In this little book Mr. Young whispers the secret formula for producing new ideas right into your ear. Whether you listen and do what he says is up to you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love despicable me. It's fun for kids that like temple run or subway surfers. You can fight vector. Get the FLUFFY UNICORN. Freeze Ray and become minon of the year.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out and now I can't wait until the next book comes out. The intensity of their love, passion and need for each other makes me believe this could be possible.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Loved it. Looking forward to the next one. Please realize these are not meant to be stand alone books. It's a series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Never read a book before that had a such a twist to the middle of the book. It left me completely mind boggled. I loved itl
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|When I saw the previews for this movie in the theater, I thought, \\"no chance\\".  But after it became available as a rental, I figured I've give it a try because Bryan Singer (X-Men) is attached to it, and Bill Nighy (Davy Jones from the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" series) voices the lead bad guy (a two-headed giant who dies an exceptionally unpleasant death at the end).<br /><br />The thing that impressed me the most about the film is that everyone in it was playing it straight. At no point did I feel that the actors were making fun of themselves, or their material, or of the audience for watching. The action was straightforward and free of super-tight close-ups and night shots that prevent you from seeing what's happening. The actors didn't come across as grim, but they weren't trying to act hip and cool (like they were in the truly awful \\"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters\\") either; they hit just the right balance and came across as normal people in an inherently absurd situation. It's also worth mentioning that there is a very strong and positive female role model in the character of the princess.<br /><br />All in all, worth viewing. It's much better than the previews might have led you to expect!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I am very satisfied with this game as both me and my family enjoys it and I wont need Wi-Fi so i can play it out and about wether on my phone or my kindle. The only thing I dont like much is that theres only one male character you start off with, I think you should at least have a choice in your gender as it bothers bothers both I and my younger cousins so.I am very grateful of this games creation and I hope many more people will enjoy it in the near future as the game is very intriguing and makes me want to play more!<br /><br />Keira -10yrs old
B002ZBPPHA|4.0|We liked the new ending. Had no idea that was in store for us. It would have been nice to select the option of endings prior to starting the movie but regardless we enjoyed the it.
B007SGM084|4.0|I chose four stars for this novel because i just liked it. It was what I expected it to be. In spite of the bad reviews I've read about this novel, I think it is worth reading. It makes you feel good. Even if it might be too repetitive, it is acceptable due to the point of view well developed by the author.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I got this app out of pure boredom....it turned out to be really fun! It was difficult by a little bit, at some points but really fun!! :D
B005ETA5K2|1.0|i had to return to Manufacturing company for repair because it didnt work. so for that one i was not happy
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Had a job to do and did it well. Glorifying being a bad ads at home...being a man has nothing to do fighting with other men. Do the right thing all the time.<br /><br />..
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story is so much more than what the description tells  you.  A wonderful heartbreaking, endearing story. This story will stay with you long after you've finished reading.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|watched this movie in 3D in movie theater, loved it so much so decided to get the DVD, watched many times now watching with my daughter, we love this movie!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|My brother has been looking for this item for a long time.<br />Saw it here and ordered it for him, he loves it. Thanks to Amazon<br />and its suppliers, I could get this and make my brother a happy camper.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Real, great acting, good plot.  Truly suspenseful and believable.  If only the law was that interesting on a day to day basis
B0096HKZ1M|4.0|The talking head was great fun. Great mad scientist in the classic B movie style and great for plenty of laughs.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Overall good book! Various littlemstoriesnthroughout the book made it a little confusing and hard to keep track of the characters, but once I figured out what was happening I was able to figure out what was going on for the most part. If you read the other books by Hosseini, you should enjoy this one also.
B00B7VPKMY|4.0|If you're looking at this Eagles box set, presumably you already know most of what you need to know about the band, and about their albums. They started as a country-influenced band, had a few hit singles and modestly successful albums. Over the course of their first four albums, they moved increasingly towards the pop/rock middle. With their fifth album, they took on rock guitarist Joe Walsh, lost the last vestiges of country (and some of their original members) and had their biggest, most shining, moment with Hotel California, which rightfully defined a musical time and place. Hubris, infighting, drugs, and many other withering influences wrecked havoc with the now huge band in the wake of Hotel California, and the long delayed swan-song studio album of their original run, The Long Run, was disappointingly inferior given expectations and the time it took to come to fruition.<br /><br />Later came the Hell Freezes Over reunion, the endless tours, and one more (decent) studio album (so far). But that part of the story isn't covered by this box.<br /><br />So what do you get here? You get all the original studio albums of their 1970s Asylum tenure. You don't get the live album from that era (rather dull anyway), and you don't get the one-off Christmas single (Please Come Home for Christmas), or a stray b-side. But other than that, this is their entire released studio output of that era. There are no bonus tracks on any of these albums. The albums also have not been remastered for this release, but instead are identical to the previous remasters from more than a decade ago. They sound fine, though...<br /><br />The mini sleeves are adequate, as is the enclosing box. There are no liner notes.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a good deal for someone who wants all the music, with decent sound quality, for a low price.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This is a great movie with Denzel giving us a strong performance in this film.  I recommend this movie even though it is more for adults than younger children.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It's not meant to replace a full sharpening, but it's great for putting an edge back on a knife and sharpening the edge
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Not a bad attempt, but I expected more Darkness in it.  The CG 'Mama' was interesting but was too much on screen in my opinion.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great predictive text on this keyboard! Often times it knows exactly what I want the next word to be. It's a fast learner. Great themes. I got it on sale, but would have gladly paid the full price. In fact I paid full price for the tablet version after being so impressed with this one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a series that I could watch over and over.  The characters are believable and the story pulls no punches.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. If you say that you have never felt like Charlie at some point in your adolescence, I don't believe you're telling the truth.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The descriptions are  easy to visualize and there is a very good and unusual  story . It does switch back and forth a lot but not hard to follow.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|To early for me to say, the concept is cool and McConaughey is the right guy to be sharp enough to hold his own as an attorney and use his car for an office. It may be easy to get tired of though. If I change my mind, I'll come back and revise my review.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Part 2, was even better than part one. I mean The Joker totally out of control. with a deadly showdown between the two of them.Robin proves her worth, and Batman and Superman go head up, who will win this powerful showdown. make no mistake about it in the DC Universe, Batman is the best of them all
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I have been a staunch Jeremy Brett fan for years and thought that, at his death, I would never see another Sherlock Holmes again.  However, Benedict and Martin have captured every nuance of Arthur Conan Doyle's characters AND then managed to translate this delightful duo into the modern high tech era we know today.  What brilliant acting!  I hope we have the pleasure of these two actors plying their craft for years to come.  Welcome to the top of the heap, gentlemen!  You have truly done it...
B00BNYCFNM|5.0|If Peter Gabriel had stayed with Genesis during the &#34;until there were 3&#34; era, it may have gone a little something like this.....(part 2).

B00D8RYV52|4.0|This game froze the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; multiple times.<br />Other than this the game was great for my kids.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love the actors...they have such a bromance going on that it leaves me laughing and truly enjoying the show. Love how easy it is to have it loaded on my amazon account so I can watch the episodes where ever I go.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|For anyone who has read the first 2 books in this trilogy, Entwined with You is definitely a must read. Very happy with this purchase.
0898159156|3.0|pictures were nice, I just felt that i was reading he same thing over and over, it was to repetitive.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|This game is fun and very addictive. I love all the features and weapons you can get. I highly recommend this game for fans of heart pumping action games.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was fun. At times it was a bit challenging but I wished it didn't stop at level 10. Looking forward to more levels.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this adaptation of the classic Sherlock Holmes. Warning: it is not for those who only enjoy the traditional view of Sherlock but I really enjoy it!
B002ISID10|5.0|I grew up listening to punk/pop. But when my sister moved out, I only listened to pop. I started going through this dark emo phase and I found Asking Alexandria and bought this album. I love everything about it. Even a random lyric like \\"I CAN'T BREATHE\\" shows the feeling and emotion he's feeling, showing the anger the lead singer shows. I love this whole entire album, even the parts that weren't screaming. The album has a good lead scream/singer, so I think it's amazing. Every track sounds different. I would recommend this to anyone who like metal/screamo.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|This is a pretty good show, I watched it because it was free to prime members and was hooked before I knew it!
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Loved this book, never read a bad Jo Nesbo book yet. Harry Hole series is both fast moving and interesting.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love this show but I wish they would get back to it being mostly funny and less drama. I would strongly recommend it!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I hate this game it is not fair that big monkey is just so unfair I hate it and it freezes my kindle don't get this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an amazing game and I would highly recommend this to all of the horse lovers<br /> about there. I love this game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hunger games is awesome! But, I'm so sad it's over! It's by far my favorite book series! Suzanne Collins, you are amazing!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey is an excellent author.<br />I thought the character development was superb, the settings,situations and the characters reactions to them were all too believable.<br />I am looking for the next group of books to follow with anticipation.
B00B7ERH04|5.0|Does anyone know why I can here my self when I record anything on any app. I'm talking I just can here myself I wonder if anyone else can here me
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Overall we liked the movie. My wife is really into any sort of medical drama, and we were huge fans of Contagion. This movie similarly explored interesting aspects of medice and law in a fun drama. I would say at the end it got a bit out of hand with its attempted plot twists and backstabbing turning everywhere on everyone. Overall still a +1, check it out.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Couldn't put this book down, as I read it in two days! Kept you wondering who was next on the list of possible suspects.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is a jumper style game, where your goal is to have the monkey bounce on the vines to collect gems, bananas, or complete certain goals (like to get to the finish line without getting stung) in a certain amount of time. If you don't like playing on a timer, I'd just recommend playing on gem quest, as you're not timed on those levels. There's also two other categories to play: totem trial and quick play (which unlocks after you begin playing--I think after totem as I only then realized there was a new category). The main difference between gem and totem besides the timer is the \\"main\\" goal of gem is to collect all five gems and in totem, you have five \\"trials\\" to complete in order to gain a circle of the totem pole.<br /><br />There are also more monkeys for you to unlock, which become unlocked as you play. There's also different \\"abilities\\" to help you that can be bought with banana points. The points are pretty easy to gain (not too easy, but not hard), which you can gain them from just collecting them on the way in gem quest, from collecting in totem after completing each trial (more if you beat them in a timely manner), or from playing quick play.<br /><br />The controls are simple, you just touch the monkey and move your finger backward (this is how far/high the monkey will go) and you move your finger in the direction you want the monkey to go. Lucky for me, there's an arrow that helps guide you (I probably wouldn't have gotten anywhere in totem without it). The graphics are wonderful and the sounds are nice though a bit too much even on medium sound (what my kindle is normally set on)--a plus, though, there's a volume bar in the options for the music and sound.<br /><br />Overall, a great game and fun way to pass time. If you like playing games with replay value, this one won't let you down. I think this game would be great for children as well (maybe a bit hard for very young children). For $1, this game is well worth it and I'd definitely recommend this game.ame.
B009LROCJI|5.0|I heard Daniel Hope perform this 'live' at the Aspen Music Festival in July 2013; I immediately went home and found the MP3 album and bought it so I could listen to it again at my leisure.  I really enjoyed this 're-composition' of Vivaldi's Four Seasons - at the beginning of each section the original version was played long enough so I recognized it, but then Max Richter took those notes and re-organized them into some additional variations which engaged my ear to really listen to what was being played.  If you like or love the original 'Four Seasons', then I think you'll want to add this version to your music library.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci has become one of my favorite writers.  His work is different and very well written.  Easy reading while making you think.
B003M6EAXM|3.0|This season is not as bad as the previous one but it's still pretty bad. Which in the big scheme of network TV, means it's just OK.<br />Nice to see Jack go postal in the last few shows and return to those bad ass moves so many 24 fans came to love. It redeems what have otherwise been a very weak season. Some of the plot twists are so overdone in this series it becomes almost laughable. (a mole in CTU? AGAIN? Really? They really need to work on their screening process.)  But at least no family members are kidnapped to force someone to do something they don't want to do.  I REALLY got tired of that one.<br /> I really loathe this ultra liberal President Taylor character, a holdover from the previous season. But at least we get to see her evolve into the same kind of political hack all presidents become. The ends always justify the means.  One more eye roller was the miraculous return of Mr Smarmy himself, President Logan (Huh? I though he got stabbed to death by his former wife two seasons ago. No matter. Resurrection is common in 24. Recall Tony's miraculous return from the dead last season. And, of course, Jack does it almost every season. )<br /> This season is modestly entertaining but doesn't kick in until the second half. Not as tightly written as many earlier seasons. Many things make absolutely no sense. Lots of plot holes (a master Russian spy intimidated by a couple of street thugs for half the season? Logan's reappearance without explanation as to how he recovered from death? Also, why would such an obviously corrupt individual be hired by a holier than thou president) But when Jack starts knocking off people with extreme prejudice at the end, it is very satisfying.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Love the show, funny, lots of action, intense. Can't wait to see Red 2.  Great actors as well. Wished we had more movies like this.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Nothing like a little bit of classic ingenuity and wit to save the day. All without promoting violence as the result, but instead weaving around it, this was a series I didn't get to watch until now, but always knew a lot about through other media (Simpsons, etc.). Lots of fun and brings back the memories... what hair!
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Every Thanksgiving my family kicks off the Christmas holiday season by watching Christmas Vacation. We all love it every time we see it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|During the past 50 years, the Bond movies seem to be getting better and better.  Of course, there is the usual action scenes (a lot of them) but the movies now portray relationships between the various characters and is as not superficial as many of the past Bond movies have been.
B0026SERTY|2.0|Generally Mcavoy can do no wrong in my opinion<br /> But after this movie was over I asked myself \\"what the heck was that?!\\"  All the actors in this film are too good for this POS. AND A REAL GRIPE I HAVE IS MAKING EVERYONE LOSE THEIR GORGEOUS ACCENTS TO SOUND AMERICAN.  I'm American and I HATE that!  Mcavoy, Colin Ferrell, Gerard Butler  et al should boycott films that make them sound like they are from NOWHERE!  Unusual miss for all the stars of this film.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|Initially thought this movie would just be a comedy based on the advertisements I saw on TV.  There is a lot more to this movie.  It delves into family relationships (mother & son in this case) and how the two of them worked through issues in their personal lives about which the other one had not been aware.  The &#34;road trip&#34; was a venue for the two of them to work out personal unresolved issues and their own relationship.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|Like so many third seasons, fails to live up to the expectations set by the first two.  A couple of unpleasant plot twists leave the viewer feeling a little let down by the end of the season, and to be honest you are probably better off spending these hours of the time you have left on earth watching a more fulfilling tv show.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Nothing spookie or teenage gore about zombies. The story is about peoples and countries' reactions and startegies of survival facing a spreading disease.
B00881VLCE|3.0|ok this is an addicting game! but the update has made it really slow! ! it's hardly responding to touch and the pieces are hard to drag. ugh please fix!!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Great balance of rock songs with a few slower ballads. I did sort of hope they would all be like \\"fire\\" but glad they were not!<br /><br />Glad I bought the entire album instead of just the one track!
B00CF34B2I|2.0|Check the file size and your available space first.  If you have the older Kindle Fire, you will not have enough room.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed the first 2 seasons so I had to continue by watching season 3.  The writer really did write great and unexpected episodes.  The final episode has left me wanting to continue watching Downton Abbey.  I would recommend starting with the first season before watching season 3.  I think you would have a better understanding of the characters with the background of all seasons.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|I did not expect to enjoy a movie about a plane crash, but I did. I hate flying,I am absolutely terrified that the plane will crash, so it took me several weeks to build up the strength to watch this movie.  It's a good movie, expresses concern for more than flying. It's the kind of movie that you can watch several times.<br /><br />I almost always get my orders earlier than expected (there was that one time that I ordered a book that I needed for class), and I really appreciate that.  Price is excellent and the quality, outstanding.
B0055S348W|5.0|I just downloaded this app. I was able to print a test email on 3 printers, HP 8600, Epson 845 and Brother 7840W on the first try. There are a bunch of options for printing and the user interface is very straightforward.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Since \\"My Colouring Book\\" I have noticed that Agnetha's voice (ex vocalist of ABBA) is more brilliant, with more exciting. The sample available shows that she hasn't lost your charming and tuned voice. I really never had waited for a releasing of an album as I have waited for this!!! The duet with Gary Barlow (Take That) is marvelous, and the disco track \\"Dance Your Pain Away\\" is a great song that seems like ABBA today, you can't stop to dance... Happily, it's comming... really it will be GREAT listening to Agnetha Faltskog again!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It shows how was life for certain rich people in times of was and how fortunate they were, interesting and entertaining.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game makes you think and will continue to make you think challenge yourself and put you're mind to the game
B0053O89JM|4.0|With well writing and good plot lines house moves like a train. I did notice a change after the 8th series, the intensity was not there as before. I don't know what changed, directors or writers, but that on the edge of your seat action was gone. This 8th season house did move like a medium train instead of the House series before, which moved fast.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My daughter and I had fun playing Sherlock Holmes and Watson withthis game. Well done! :) she consistently asks to play this game, and I'm happy to oblige.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|From the first movie I knew this would be a franchise of movies. Some movies you can tell by looking at them. Action, love, naivete of the characters of what is really going on, comedy. This combination is what keeps most movies into the trilogy series. The problem with most movies like this...you tend to run out of ideas after the fourth movie...time will tell.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|They've gone more pop than in their previous albums but One Republic is still my favorite band out there! Whether you're new to them or have been listening to them for years I would highly recommend this band.
B003INBNXO|5.0|While searching through Netflix for something to watch the other night, I came across this movie. Judging from the cover picture, I guessed this movie was yet another over-blown, outrageous, ultra-violent and angry martial arts movie. In other words, I didn't have high hopes for it. After watching it for a half hour, though, I realized this movie was nothing like I expected. It was a rather calm, serious historical fiction movie that was based on actual events. The acting was good, the sets were good, and the fight choreography was the best I've ever seen. This movie had none of the supernatural Kung fu silliness of people jumping from building to building or kicking other people through walls or catching sword blades with their bare hands or stuff like that.<br /><br />The fight scenes were fast and furious and really a marvel to watch. I was unfamiliar with the actors or the director or anyone else in the movie, but everyone involved with it impressed me.<br /><br />The one thing that is a bit of a mystery to me is the R rating. This movie had two or three swear words and not much blood. Though there was a lot of Kung fu action, most of it was bloodless. There were a couple of shootings, but only one death by shooting. I think the R rating was too strong. A PG-13 rating would have been plenty strong. I would have no problem letting my 13-year old daughter or 11-year old son watch this movie. The lead character is a married man of morals, principles, discipline and honor, and that is a rare thing in movies, these days.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to all fans of Kung fu movies or anyone who just enjoys good action movies!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I had no idea where the story was going to go when I bought this. It's a mystery meets secret society meets heist. Love the characters! I want to read more by this author.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Admittedly, Joss had decent material to work with. I give Marvel props for the movies setting up the main characters in the Avengers, but I think Joss did an excellent job at what is a difficult task. Introduction/origin movies tend to be the easiest because they're where we see the most growth in super heroes, and while this was an origin story, it was the origin of team, which is much more difficult than defining an individual. I think Joss handled the formation of the Avengers with skill, reverence and humor. It's an enjoyable, action packed movie with a solid plot, great dialogue and fitting character development. What more could you really ask for?
B004YW4L5K|5.0|An elegant, intelligent, and deeply creative work that delves into the nature of godhood in America, American God's will have you falling in love with deities both common and exotic as you travel expanses of a beautifully rendered America with a deeply relatable protagonist.
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|The Hollywood label of \\"science fiction\\" sadly mostly denotes violent movies with aliens killing people, lots of special effects and little to really tease the mind. This is the opposite--a rare science fiction film which focuses on ideas and human stories, and which appeals to our imaginations.<br /><br />What I love about this movie is how it convincingly and chillingly portrays an imagined future world. Creating a futuristic world (particularly a dystopian one) is the main strength of director Andrew Niccol and he did it beautifully here. The sterile and orderly look of an earth taken over by aliens, superior in some ways to us, was brilliantly done--down to the chilling grocery stores devoid of brand names and even checkout counters. There's one thirty-second scene in a store which, at least for me, was worth the entire movie.<br /><br />But the brilliant world building was completely eclipsed by one of the worst scripts I have ever seen in any movie. Usually even the most boring hackneyed scripts are at least reasonably professional in a dull conventional kind of way. This one--while tantalizingly creative--was simply amateurish. It almost completely failed to meet the most basic requirement of building a plot arc that keeps us interested and engaged...not to mention poor character development and flat, dull dialog. The excellent actors, William Hurt and Saoirse Ronan among others, did a valiant job with almost nothing to work with, but oh, what a waste of such a great cast!<br /><br /> Like the book, the movie script focused on emotional and human impact of the alien-themed plot, rather than on violence and action. I like that. But, the movie script--like the book--slogged along with no strong plot tension, no sense of timing or urgency, poor dialog, nonexistent character development. This is due largely to it fairly closely following the book, which was wonderful, for an amateur writer, but it just didn't have what was needed to make it into a good movie. Someone should have had the guts give the movie the professional overhaul it desperately needed.  If they'd taken the book as a starting point and hired a competent, seasoned writer to revamp it completely, this movie could have been on the level of Gattaca.<br /><br />It's sad really. I don't know if Andrew Niccol didn't know how to reimagine it or if he didn't have the go-ahead to do so. But if you're a fan of real science fiction (about ideas, not about violence) and if you like dystopic tales, you should see this anyway. It's a passably good rainy night bowl of popcorn don't have too high an expectation kind of movie.eone should have had the guts give the movie the professional overhaul it desperately needed.

B00B7Y0206|3.0|Before the updata, this app was the best YouTube video viewer for the kindle fire. But now, the app wont work at all. It wont install the updata. I tried removing the app from my kindle and re-installing it, but I had the same problem. &quot;This app could not be installed&quot; it said.<br />Bottom line, it was a great app when it worked and I hope Voyage fixes the problems.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Great read. Different than &#34;Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;1000 Spledid Suns&#34; but just as good. I highly recommend it.  My favorite of his so far.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Very entertaining. I watched the entire 1st season in one night-of course! Funny. Intriguing. Good show for young at hearts.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I enjoy this show.  It's not an award winner, but it is entertaining.  The casting was well done for this show.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|This is confronting, and definitely NOT a HEA story.  It is powerful, thought provoking and you should have tissues, lots whilst you read.  If I'd  known the subject matter, I wouldn't have read it this year.  Having said that, I'm glad I did.  I feel disturbed (in a good way).<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|All you do in this game is tap, tap, tap, and more tapping.  It is more than a bit boring.

B001F290E4|5.0|This was the first CD I have every brought for SEAL and I was impressed.  He has a beautiful voice and I like the old school music he put on his tracks.  Sometimes you like to sit back and be caressed by the oldies but goodies.  Job well done!!
B00CATSONE|4.0|I had studied a little about Tesla over the years, and heard about him when there was discussion about Edison. This book magnified what little I knew. He really made the electrification of the world possible, but also had to struggle with ignorance and greed on the part of others to make it happen. He was way ahead of his time. The book itself could have been more detailed. It seemed like the author was trying to quickly describe the man and his achievements in the most expedient way.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I always love when I buy a CD and like the entire CD and don't have to skip tracks.  Just like his other CD's, I like his flow and energy.  Love It!!  His CD's always have great music!

Great cast, great writers and great plots. Who is \\"A\\" and who is \\"Red Coat\\" ? It's more complex than u ever thought!!! 3 seasons in and I'm still scratching my head. This A mystery is baffling as it is fun to be a part of.

086571701X|3.0|Sylvia Bernstein has written a nice book on Aquaponics.<br />This book will help out many of those new to this technology.<br />As for me, I've been involved since 1977 so none of these books do that much for me. All of the so-called X-Spurts have only come to this technology in the last five or ten years, give or take five years.<br /><br />A few have written books about it, so everyone thinks they are the Big Kahuna's or the Big Gurus of Aquaponics.<br />Fact is Aquaponics is a very old technology that has only been rediscovered.  In the last ten to fifteen years here in the USA, people have started to realize that there are safer, better ways to provide both quality protein and produce, without the use of soil, insecticides and herbicides.<br /><br />It was the Australians who took the two technologies of Aquaculture and Hydroponics and coined the term Aquaponics.<br />Still, there is nothing new about this; it's only a reawakening of an ancient form of growing food.<br />Be very careful though ..... There are numerous publications out there, which have been heavily plagiarized, because everyone thinks they know all about it and are trying to make a fast buck off of your lack of knowledge.

It incorporates the additional content with the original content.  The illustrations, charts and maps are profuse and extremely well done.  I have nothing but great praise for the genius of THE ELDER SCROLLS and this latest guide through that immense world.  (It would be nice to have the first two ELDER SCROLLS as DLC if not on disc.)

B000FC1MCS|4.0|This charming novel was a quick and easy read for the summer. I immediately fell in love with Christopher, the 15 year old narrator of this book who has Asperger's Syndrome. Christopher informs his reader that he is writing a mystery novel because he wants his readers to be entertained. While a portion of the novel discusses the mystery of the dog in the night, the majority of the novel is Christopher's daily life. However, because of Christopher's unique perspective of the world, his narrative does not fail to entertain.

B001L5VYFI|2.0|The album starts off great, but soon it becomes too much of each member playing their solo material alone on stage or with one other member. There aren't the full band harmonies that make them so great or enough of the electric material. This album is more of a promotion for the solo work than CSNY material.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read many books on this topic and this one is definitely in the top 5. More and more books in this genre are being written and the publics awareness of this aspect of spirituality is growing. Since the information surrounding what happens to a person's soul after death cannot be confirmed and substantiated we have to rely upon the individual's personal experience and credibility as well as how they relate to the volume of work already published. In this case we have a highly skilled and published Neurosugeon who has been trained through the rigours of evidence based science who now is willing to consider &#34;something else&#34; may exist beyond the ability of science to explain. This alone is a big breakthrough, but even more it allows us as readers to consider a world beyond our own with the hope that life does not end at death but only continues.  I highly recommend this book and the way it flows, draws you in wanting more. Enjoy it.

B0094M2ODQ|1.0|Every scene in this ego trip for Babs was someone worshipping her. Horrible waste of money time and effort. This is the kind of movie that can end marriages.
B00915G6YE|5.0|This season did a good job of coming off the end of sixth season and made me anxious to see the eighth. Being a big &#34;Chuck&#34; fan i was excited to see yvonne strahovski show up consistently as well. If your a dexter fan you should like it, if you have never seen dexter start with season one.<br />I gave it five stars because i really like the show and amazon had it for 29.99 when it was around 45 dollars in stores.

B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a great game :) my child really enjoys it.  I also enjoy playing it as it involves some strategy.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Reliable. Quick. Easy to use. Love the option for forecast. maps. video<br /> and saving multiple locations. Loads smoothly. Must have.
B006LSZECO|2.0|After reading the rave reviews, I was so excited to read this book.  It kept my attention until it literally just ended.  No wrap up, no justice for the vilian, no logical book ended.  It was like the author just gave up.  Regardless of how good the rest of the book was, I get so angry when I am dissapointed at the end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I recommend this app to everyone who has been wanting a game that just is fun to play anytime anywhere. Love it.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|This is a well written book and definitely one of the most accessible introductions to cooking that I have seen. It definitely sold me on the Tim Ferriss learning and his approach to breaking down learning. However, I would say it has a couple of limitations that make it less useful than it could be. First, Tim does a decent amount of cross selling in the book so it always leaves me wondering to what extent his recommendations are reasonably objective. This is especially true when it comes to his other books (4-hour body, 4-hour work week). Which brings me to my second point, this book is in some senses designed to be paired with the 4-hour body. I prefer cooking vegetarian and am not particularly interested in following his slow-carb diet (high in proteins, low in starchy carbs). That left me looking for alternatives to recipes and made one entire section of the book relatively useless (the scavenging/foraging section which has a lot related to hunting). I had some exposure to cooking beforehand so I could work around this, but I don't think a vegetarian who is new to cooking would be able to get nearly as much out of it. Even after all those caveats though, I think it's a great book. It fits its objective of making cooking more accessible and even creating some excitement about learning to cook really well. If you're a meat eater, I would say this is a must buy. If you're vegetarian, I would say get it as long as you have some basic cooking exposure but want to take your cooking to the next level.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game not very complex but still interesting enough to keep your attention. I do recommend this game and best of all its free.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|I really enjoy this game. I just wish I had more time to play. My wife doesn't mind me playing as long as I quit complaining when I miss.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|the game is a good game and helps you use your mind I would deginetly recommended this game to people

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I wasn't going to download tempel run but since its the minions I did. I love this game its sooooo fun.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like the app. Like the fact that I can download books from amazon onto my iPad for my munchkins. I just don't like the fact that amazon doesn't have the children books section sorted by age. I have to scroll through all the vampire books and teenage love books and in between there'll be a book for preschoolers.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Bought this because my wife had surgery and I forgot to record the Season Finale, glad that I did.  After ten years the acting is still fresh and nuances of the characters are still being revealed.  New themes, developing relationships, and plots that avoid &#34;cookie cutter&#34; style keep me intrigued.  Hope they manage another 10 years or more!

B001F6TXME|5.0|Performs as promised, arrived promptly, and I love having this cable in my camera bag... always at the ready when I'm setting up on tripod and needing to avoid bumping the set-up.  Also helps with set-up at a little distance & hiding yourself a bit... as in catching shots of wildlife!
B0055S348W|2.0|It was able to find my network printer and install the correct driver, but the printing interface is useless. The software must install &quot;renderers&quot; and after two 4MB in-app downloads, it couldn't render a simple text file.<br /><br />Just use Cloud Print.
0345803485|5.0|Let me just start by saying I was a little hesitant before reading this book. Every review or little comment I saw written about it described it as basically porn. Never the less, I decided to purchase it when I saw it on sale on a daily deal site for around 7$, just out of curiousity. At the time, I didn't know I would fall so deeply in love with this author's writing or the amazing storyline.<br /><br />This is a story about a girl named Anastasia (or Ana). She is a young English Litterature student that lives with her roomate, Kate. Kate is a jouralist for the school newspaper and on the day of her very important interview with the young (and very handsome) entrepaneur Mr. Christian Grey, she gets the flu and asks Ana to go instead of her. That's how the story of Ana and Christian begins.<br /><br />The story itself reminds me a lot of some kind of a love story with a forbidden love, a little like Twilight, or the likes of it. It's very cute, very romantic at parts and over-all the perfect love story. But, here comes the twist, instead of it being a Young Adult book with a predator like a vampire or a werewolf, in this story we have Christian. Christian has a very \\"singular erotic taste\\", like the book's description, and pulls Ana into his world.<br /><br />The book is the perfect balance between the \\"love story\\" side of it and the \\"erotic\\" parts, which makes it so unique. I really have enjoyed reading this book and the rest of the series, as well. As soon as I was done reading the first one, I ran to the store to get the next! It was a really captivating series and I hope with all my heart that the author does go ahead and continue writing more books!<br /><br />Over all, this book was amazing and I truely, whole heartedly recommend this series! (to anyone aged 17 and up)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I read Tolkien when I was 30 and 45 years later I found Thrones.  Had the timing been reversed, I might never have finished the Ring Trilogy.  Thrones is full of very recognizable and human characters, with just a light touch of the supernatural.  I haven't seen any of the film versions and probably won't.  GRRM has painted such strong characters on a dark landscape that I don't want to see it through other eyes.  This is a real world with a perfect balance of blood and sex.  I haven't read much fantasy, but I will continue with this series, until its time runs out, or mine does.
0061726834|4.0|When I first heard about Delirium, I really liked the idea of a world where love is forbidden, a disease. It was obvious to me that I really wanted to read it, especially since I recently got into reading a bunch of dystopian novels, but the cover totally threw me off. I'm the kind of person that judges a book by its cover (I know its awful, no need to tell me) and I really dislike this one. I had this sitting in my room for about 2 weeks before finally deciding to pick it up and start reading. I did not regret it.<br /><br />Delirium is the story of Lena, a seventeen and a half years old girl that awaits the operation everyone is so eager to get. The operation that will cure her of the Deliria, of love. In Lena's world, love, or amor deliria nervosa, is a disease and at the age of eighteen you get Cured. Lena is so excited, she's counting down the days until her operation, until she start her new life as a Cured. But then she falls in love.<br /><br />When I first started reading this book, I couldn't stand Lena, she seemed to make all the wrong choices, was too submissive and just way too goody-two-shoes. But (and that's a big but), as the book progressed, so has she. She started thinking for herself, showed some very great acts of bravery and actually lived for once in her life!<br /><br />The love story of this book was extremely cute. The constant danger they were in made the book extremely gripping and hard for me to put down. The characters were great- I especially liked Hana, she was strong, independent and as opposed to Lena, she actually thought for herself since the very beginning. Also, I just really liked the friendship she had with Lena which was extremely cute.<br /><br />The writing was really good too! I loved, loved, loved all the small \\"quotes\\" Lauren added to the beginnings of chapters, which made the whole thing a lot more gripping and had me sucked into the story just that much more. I especially loved the poem in chapter 6- it was the most frightening yet beautiful thing I'd read in a while.<br /><br />But the ending.... was just the best and worst thing in the world! I am just so stunned by it and cannot wait to read the next book in the series!!<br />Overall, this book was really fun to read and I enjoyed every minute of it!<br /><br />[4.5 Stars]ghtening yet beautiful thing I'd read in a while.<br /><br />But the ending.... was just the best and worst thing in the world!

B0063M22QO|4.0|Love the game. Thank goodness you can turn off the music! So far the puzzles haven't been a challenge though. I've even skipped ahead to work on the harder ones.
0385737955|3.0|I have been contemplating on what to write about this book for almost 2 weeks. This book just left me so confused- I loved and hated it all at the same time.<br /><br />This is the story of Thomas, a boy of appox. 16 years old. When he wakes up in the Glade, he has no recollection of his past, he cannot remember any faces or names from his pre-Glade life. In the Glade, he encounters a group of boys, who are all in the exact position he's in- trapped in the Glade, a place surrounded by an unsolvable maze. For 2 years, every day a group of Runners go to search for a way to solve the maze, every day they fail. Even though Thomas knows all the risks involved, he has an unexplainable urge to join them and become a Runner himself. Only problem- time is running out.<br /><br />The storyline was amazing, very gripping and totally lovable and so were the characters! I loved Thomas and felt like I could somewhat relate to him throughout the story. I felt his struggles, his pain and his brief moments of joy. Also, I absolutely adored Theresa's character and I really think she made the whole thing come together the way it did.<br /><br />But at the same time, I just didn't enjoy the way this book was written at all. The beginning was horrible, all those \\"slang\\" words inserted every other word in the first couple chapters just got me so confused and made the whole reading experience really unenjoyable. I felt like I had to over think every sentence I read and I found myself stopping at every new chapter and trying to convince myself to go ahead and read it. I've even started (and finished) a new book while reading this one.<br /><br />At some point I got sort of used to the horrible writing, but I really wish it had been written by a different author, since the story itself was so good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a ton of fun. The entire family is addicted to it and actually plays it together. The graphics, it is not challenging but is fun to watch it grow and learn new tasks. Great for mindless relaxation
014241493X|4.0|This book was... really something.<br /><br />It was a little hard for me to get into the story at first, the beginning is interesting and fun but then it just morphs into this search after Margo and then into the search of the meaning of life and it just turns into a really complicated story. I wasn't so sure I liked it and it was hard for me to read more than a couple pages at a time when I picked it up, but at some point, I really cannot pin point exactly when, it just got so amazing and real and addicting. I could not put it down and when I did, it hunted my thoughts all day.<br /><br />Green's writing is just phenomenal. There is no other way to describe how beautiful his writing style is and just how captivated I become when I read one of his books. The characters definitely evolved throughout this story, from the point of view of the reader, but also from their point of view, as well. I loved the adventure-y vibe this book has and how it succeeded at contemplating death, suicide and life in a manner that put the reader at ease.<br /><br />It was really something.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Good movie, but still just a traditionalist with this storyline. Franco creates a character that is fun and the rest of the cast is just so-so,,,,,would not watch again.<br /><br />Sets and costume work are nice, great work with production.
0545123275|5.0|So I've finally come around to reviewing my favorite book of all times. Since it's been over a year ago that I've discovered this amazing series, I re-read it this week for the purpose of making this review and fell in love all over again.<br /><br />This is the first book I've read by Maggie Stiefvater, but she already became one of my very favorite authors (I can't wait to read The Raven Boys!). Her writing is absolutely fantastic. She is very captivating and keeps you from putting your book down for even a minute! The story itself is told from two different points of view, Grace's and Sam's, and through her amazing writing I could actually tell who was \\"speaking\\" without having to look in the beginning of the chapter to see who it was. She really captured each character's personality through the book.<br /><br />This is one of the sweetest love stories I've ever read. You cannot help but fall instantly in love with the world of the wolves and the love that Sam and Grace share! There was not a dull moment in this book- every single page of it was fascinating and enjoyable. I have to mention the amazing songs Sam wrote throughout the entire book- I think they were what made me connect to the story even more. I would find myself singing them to myself for a whole week after I finished the book!<br /><br />Another thing that cannot go unsaid is the amazing design of the book. The cover is beautiful and I absolutely loved the way they matched the inside to the outside- in Shiver, the book is written in light blue ink, in Linger, in green and in Forever it's red, all to match the various covers! I just thought that it was very unique and artistic of Maggie and gave it a really nice touch.<br /><br />Like I mentioned before, this is my absolute favorite book of all times and if you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend it!
B0036UMM84|4.0|Great Love Story and Barbara Streisand's killer vocals take you on an emotional roller-coaster in this film...especially at the end of the movie. Great Story and I gave it 4 stars only because I wanted more of Streisand...she is a great actor!
0307887448|5.0|This book was really good! The story line was extremely unique- a breath of fresh air.<br />Going into this book I didn't know what to expect what so ever. I didn't even know the premise of the book! All I knew is that I heard people raving about this book non-stop and just had to read it. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />Ready Player One takes place in the 21st century, about 40 years from now. In the book, planet earth is almost completely destroyed and reality completely sucks. It's a good thing they have a way to get away from it. It all started when a guy named Halliday invented the most amazing video game of all time. The OASIS, which evolved into a way of living instead of being just a game, took over everything- everyone started to go to school online, to work thorough their consoles and even interacting with people became a thing you only did on the OASIS. Basically, it became their alternate reality.<br /><br />Then, out of nowhere- the creator of the OASIS, Halliday, passed away. In his will he left the greatest video game created yet. A series of riddles and challenges that will get the winner everything. Control over the OASIS, the entire fortune Halliday made over the years which amounts to more than 50 billion dollars and world-wide recognition.<br /><br />Ready Player One follows Wade Watts (or Pazival), a teenage boy who dreams of winning the competition. In the story, we get to encounter some quite amazing characters (I especially liked Aech), fun 80′s references and a super cute love story.<br /><br />I loved Cline's writing style. I felt like I was a part of the hunt and could totally see the world actually evolving to what was described in the book. It felt realistic, while keeping a fun unexpected twist to the whole plot.<br />I really liked the characters, I felt like, as a teenage girl who spends most of her time online, I could totally relate to them. The plot was interesting and quite unique- I was a little surprised when I just started reading the book that it was mainly about video games, but I found that I really enjoyed it. My inner geek totally came out.<br /><br />I think that if you're a fan of video games, computers, technology, the 80′s or anything of that sort, you will absolutely love this book. But even if you're not necessarily a fan of these things, which I didn't know I was prior to reading this book, give it a try- you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />[4.5 Stars]ing the book that it was mainly about video games, but I found that I really enjoyed it.

B009CF3MEK|5.0|I want to compare it to the New Gatsby with Leonardo DiCaprio...story line followed closely and well done in my opinion. This was my original viewing...again, a big Robert Redford fan, but Bruce Dern was heartless and Fay Dunaway played a great...Ditz!<br />Anyway...definitely worth seeing!
B0057URWSQ|5.0|What can I say? It's a really fun show to watch. All the characters develop in really interesting ways, it's more than a show about lawyers. Much, much more.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Dustin Hoffman is Fantastic in this movie and definitely supports the entire film. I am a big Tom Cruise fan as well (early in his career), but Hoffman steels the show. Into the movie, Cruise show compassion for his brother that he never knew about...breakthrough communication between his autistic brother and himself...was touching. Always a Great Movie!!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|one of the good movie due to the special effect it had in its so will do again to do....................
B0036FYO12|4.0|The only thing I can say is that I am a Robert Redford fan; have not seen a movie with him in it that I did not like. So, in other words, the story lines are not predictable and I like that in a movie....
B009YBTZ8O|5.0|I gave this book a go because I'm a long-time fan of the Studio Ghibli version of Howl's Moving Castle. And while the book and movie are different in their storylines, both are full of the same gorgeous imagery and quirky characters. This is a story that will stay with you. I highly recommend it for all ages.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Too predictable,just more of the same old thing in plot and actors.<br />Just glad I did not pay to see this in the theater and waited to view on Amazon.<br />The title for the next movie should be &#34;Dependables&#34;
B0014E9188|5.0|disc 1 is a great concert experience. They do a great job of compressing a good deal of favorites from two previous albums as well as some rare ones. disc 2 has a lot of behind the scene photos, a couple more live performances and videos. You can't go wrong buying this set.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|well the game is super fun.  but my kindle stopped collecting coins.  I don't know what's up with it.  but its still a super fun drawesome game ;)
B0059DQHHI|4.0|I'd never heard of this movie and was delighted at the plot twists.  Interesting characters that draw your interest and empathy.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I can't even describe why.  It is so different from my usual genre, but once I watched the first sean I couldn't wait to see more.  I enjoy the characters and the costumes and the scenery.
B0098VYE4U|2.0|Interesting premise -- what if the newly elected pope felt unworthy and incapable of the job.  The movie never developed that idea and never got off the ground.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The characters are great and these books are well written.  He has a great imagination and comes up with things you think could really happen!  Once I start reading, I do not want to quit.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|Well done movie- realistic, fairly historically accurate I think- well acted. Makes me want to delve more into the fascinating history of these awful, larger-than-life people.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|A fun way to waste a couple hours, but not a great movie.  Bad acting, stupid plot, but lots of action.
B00CD4RPWM|2.0|I felt like it was just a revisit of Outlander with pictures.  The graphics were also hard to see on my kindle.
B005MLP8E0|5.0|I had always heard that this was a great movie, but I had never watched it.  I'm glad I finally did.  It really is as good as all the critics say.
B003JTHXN6|4.0|Tony was real!  I love books that come across in the voice of the author...the real guy!  Warts and wonders!  If only  the rest of corporate America could learn from this and see that you can be successful and not treat your people as numbers.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I use fractions all the time in my work and thought it would be nice to have an app that quickly and accurately verifies my solutions.  This app is so easy to use that I reach for it instead of my scientific calculator to provide a quick check.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|It's not predictable by any means(just like the books &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34;.  HBO doesn't hold any punches in terms of production values and the same goes for their Blu-ray discs.  Each episode is downright gorgeous and sounds great.  If you want a more mature themed fantasy show that is not afraid to go where most shows do not, this is the one for you.  Pure quality entertainment at it's finest.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game to pass the time with! The levels keep  getting harder.  Making it addicted. You must play to find out.
B004XZR63M|4.0|At minimum, people should be motivated to want to get their finances in order. Take the information and apply it to your own life. Why choose to be poor when you can be rich?
B005DOKL3E|5.0|This sleeve is a perfect fit, padded enough for protection of the unit, and I think it looks great. Purchased at same time as the Kindle, glad I did.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This game not only looks great, it's also fun. Like any game of this sort, it is somewhat repetitive but if you enjoy games like this you'll probably like it.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It is cute for my kids they have fun and it keeps them busy and not driving me crazy they like the little dragon
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Really enjoyed the zombie apocalypse from a biographical viewpoint. Definitely a page turner... I would recommend this to anybody looking for a good read!!

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I loved traveling with Harold on his &#34;adventure&#34; - for better or for worse!  Have some Kleenex towards the end, you will need it!  The book does end on a great note!
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|It tells the portion of the story that it's based on and then some. It mentions every part of the story that Tolkien has in the book. Ian McKellen reprises his role as Gandalf and does it quite well and the cast playing the dwarves play their roles quite well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Like the games.  They are different but interesting.  Fun way to pass the time<br />,some of them are a little  complicated but they definitely make you use some brain power which is always a good thing<br />..
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Quite comical and relaxing I like watching this movie, especially when I need to relax it calms me down and I always have a positive attitude while watching it. I'm looking forward to seeing Despicable Me 2 in the near future
B00821PCJS|1.0|I could only stand to watch the pilot for about 10 minutes. Too depressing and I didn't see any way for the story to get better at all.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Wonderful game and  great challenge. Sat with teenagers and solved puzzles.  Played against another team and was great for family time.  Cannot wait for other floors.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best app ever any boy or girl would love I love it so much though mojang would cut down the price to about 1.99
B0076DELIG|5.0|I started reading it and I thought I had read it before but it was just a flashback to a previous time. Enjoyed it very much.
B006MGDVIY|5.0|A wonderful documentary of F1 in the late 1980's and early 1990's through the drama and controversy of two of its great drivers, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost.  With vintage footage, home videos, and enlightening narration, it is an artistic telling of a sports tragedy that I believe has largely been forgotten outside of the F1 world.  This might be one of my favorite documentaries of all time.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Enjoyed the movie,And the story line,Got to love every movie this great man stares in,A must to add to your collection
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't even know where to start with this book... it's kind of one of those \\"I'm still shell-shocked after experiencing emotional trauma at the hands of a book but I have to explain why that was one of the best experiences ever.\\" But I'll do what I can.<br /><br />Simply put, John Green is the kind of author that speaks TO you very deeply, not AT you like a lot of authors. You get the sense when reading his work like he's writing a story not just for the money or because his readers expect it of him, but because he wanted to speak to you. To communicate with you, as the reader, and to tell you something that's important to him. We all know John Green is an adult, but the way he writes, he is very clearly still a kid at heart. He sees things the way teenagers see things, and not in that overdramatic, cliche way a lot of authors fall into. He tells it like it's real. And you feel like it's real when you read it.<br /><br />Something I learned from taking creative writing classes in college, is that not every story has to be sweeping and epic and suspenseful and deeply plot-oriented. The best books are oftentimes the books we relate to the most, with people in relate-able situations. There doesn't always have to be a traumatic crisis by page seven, or a budding proletariat revolution by page fifteen. Sometimes all you need is story, a believable experience of someone in everyday life just trying to survive in this world. John Green has landed himself squarely in that golden zone. He's made the story meaningful without making it grand, and engrossing without making it grossly overdone. And in a sense, this makes it feel more real to the reader than any YA novel about teens saving the world with their newly discovered powers of magic and their devastatingly attractive male cohort.<br /><br />Another thing I adore about Mr. Green's writing is that though he writes for a young adult audience, he writes intelligently. Not just intelligently, but with a certain level of genius. Several times throughout the book I would literally have to put it down and sit there for a minute, just absorbing what he said. He would have these unexpected pockets and moment of profundity that would catch you off guard in the best ways. Most of the story is composed with wit and humor and then sometimes he'll just hit you with it--a philosophical nugget that enriches the entire experience. It's like biting into a cookie and then finding the inside is full of chocolate. It's almost like reading a mix of a YA book and a book on philosophy. It's precisely awesome. What makes it even better is that John Green doesn't try to dumb anything down for you. Unlike a lot of authors with shallow plots and characters and barely any actual intelligence in the writing, John actually talks to you like you're a smart adult, not just a teenager. He believes that his readers are as smart as anyone else, and that's quite gratifying to read. He doesn't try to dumb anything down for you. It's all there, and it makes you think, and I believe that is something that makes this book (and Mr. Green's other stories) very special.<br /><br />Of course the issue many people who don't like the book address is the problem of Hazel and Augustus not talking or sounding like believable teenage characters. I admit that most teenagers are not as thoughtful, intelligent, profound, or use as big of vocabulary as these characters. However, John Green is not completely off base. I can say from personal experience that teenagers can be that smart. I was one of them, or at least I spent a lot of my time around them in high school and now in college. So while Hazel's and Augustus's level of sophistication and grammatical aptitude is somewhat unusual, it's not completely abnormal. (Also note that several times, Augustus will use big words in the wrong context. Mr. Green says he did this on purpose, because Augustus is a character who tries hard to be grand but still is not in many ways. He just wantsto be. As John Green said, \\"I don't think Hazel or Gus necessarily have particularly high IQs (Gus in particular is constantly misusing words). I just think they're intellectually curious\\"). In short, even if it was unusual, I thought it made it better. For once, teenagers in YA books aren't just average and ditsy and content with their limited knowledge of their universe. Augustus and Hazel want to know more and strive to be more, and I love it.<br /><br />Anyway, I have probably rambled for long enough, but I could probably write essays upon essays about why I adore this book and why it is an astoundingly great piece of literature. But suffice to say, John Green has created a masterpiece, and I believe it will rest forever in a prominent place on the history shelves of phenomenal literature.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Being a Johnny Depp fan and adding this to my collection was a treat for the whole family to enjoy
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i do a lot of crafts and math comes into play with the patterns, especially when i want to enlarge to reduce the pattern. i was always having to drop what i was doing and go to a calculator to figure out my stitches. now with this app i have it right there with my craft i am working on. this is terrific app
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|This was great--made me want to see the new production, but also it's just a great movie unto itself. The story is quirky, and I found myself interested in actual boot and shoemaking afterwards, and looking up lasts and all sorts of equipment. The story is fictional, so don't judge northern England by it, but the themes and issues are brought up in a very convincing way, and there's not really a &#34;quick fix&#34; offered in the movie's treatment of serious human traumas and relationships, although there's a relatively happy ending, thank goodness.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I used the earlier version of app and was very easy to navigate on kindle fire hd.  This latest revised version is a mess to use.  Day. By day forecast at a glance of circles is pretty but useless compared to earlier daily forecast at a glance. Row and column unintentionally looks like calendar format but not true to the day position.  Navigating from location to location requires a stylus because my man size fingers can't use the micro buttons and reminds me that all app developers must have child sized fingers or &hellip;develop these apps on full size tablets.  Old app version rated *****  this revision wanna be update ** on unfriendly user interface.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|So I purchased this for my two sons, because they are huge minecraft fans. I thought this was going to be a rather large lego set, but is when we opened it; it was filled with multiple blocks and only created a 5x5' cube. The creepers are only 2 one blocks and a thin two block. But I was surprised with how quick it shipped, and the packaging was really nice.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|One of the best things about this app is how unobtrusive it is.  I have it on my Kindle HD - it keeps track of battery usage and can tell me how much time I have based on what I want to do (web, reading, etc). That it does this w/o annoying me in any other way was a big surprise.  Highly recommended.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|My kids love it and watch it all the time. It came in great condition had no problems. Thank you.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Classic Tarantino movie, fit snug within his gory and awe inspiring universe of films. A must watch, even if you are not a well versed Tarantino fan.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game. Can`t wait for more. I highly recommend this game. If you like &quot;locked&quot; puzzles, this is a game you have to play.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This is a great game to play after a busy day. Starts out easy and progresses to more challenging levels. It is well designed and you can skip a level if you get stuck. Only downside after purchasing this app you still need to purchase hints. I'll skip the level, thank you.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I liked the movie and the script and acting was good but the movie was not exactly true to the book.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Easy to learn, many, many levels....for a long term experience or a short train commute.<br />I hope the developer adds more features and makes the warriors customizeable.<br />This will be a classic.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun don't get me wrong but it needs to be more challenging. I got to level five in five minutes an  I just got the app five minutes ago. Thank you
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great. It keeps my daughter quiet and busy!!  I play it once in awhile  and I love it sometime I even get addicted!!! :)
0679805273|5.0|How can you go wrong with Dr Seuss??  Bought this for my 2 kids to track their growing up and give to them when they graduate highschool
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|From slace from 1to 100 I would say 100 because it so much fun because you can turn xxl that's why you should get this app form the app store!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|My 10 year-old wanted to read this book to see how it compared to the movie.  I read it first.  Truly surprised at the differences.  Particularly surprised at how violent parts are.  Not for small children and maturity should be considered for older children.  I enjoyed the book and it was a quick read.
B005I4JG80|1.0|I hate this book do not read this book this book is boring  if you read this book you will fall asleep  because it is so boring
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am thrilled that Prime now has the show that I missed when out of the country this spring!  I am enjoying it!<br /><br />Patty
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|I have been missing the First Album since I got rid of my old scratched up album collection. Also tired of listening to the echoing jacked up version of all my favorite songs in the six pack collection. Great to have all these in a small package. Love the old album covers also. This is pretty bare bones otherwise. No inserts etc just great music!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I absolutally LOVE this book. I especialy like the characters and all the action. I am a rising fifth grader and I have been enjoying this series. I can't wait for The House of Hades.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|Every time I read a pdf file is torture.  Cannot bookmark, notate, highlight... Do I have the wrong app?  Why can't it work?
B00821PCJS|5.0|A good script with twists and turns coupled with a good cast makes the sum much larger than the parts
B000FCK65W|5.0|A lovely book.  I'm sorry it took me so long to read it.  I'm sure it will be one I'll read again every few years.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|If you like Gosh then you will love his new cd that's out, He is always some fine listening but he just seams to get better and better would recommend anything new (or old) by Josh Groban
B008MM9630|4.0|I like the game I would fix a couple of things like making it easier to complete tasks and some of the early tasks you cant complete until like level 20 so why give us those tasks so early if they fixed those things I would then give it 5 stars.
B004KKX80A|1.0|I got this beyblade for my son he was so excited to get it, we got it early so he was really happy,when opened it he put it together then launched it, its tip broke in two ,so I guess i got a defective one so I want refund or another one
B00B4VXQC8|1.0|What is going on with this high energized rock band? I rather want to buy Young or Bruce or Dylan if I wished to hear this mellow songs. Is Sambora alive or they got another guitarrist, because his feeling is lost. The worst CD of Bon Jovi.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Loved the first two books but painstakedly read through the third.  For me, it was too much--too much action, too much violence, too much death....
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|An amazing piece of work here. This QR makes a great comeback with great drums, great guitar solos and an amazing fresh voice so good that makes you forget Tate is not there... as if never been there. Buy this record and you will enjoy great QR music... close to be as good as Empire.

B003L20IJM|5.0|I thought that this film was excellent and full of love and goodness.  It's just the sort of film I would want my grandchildren to see
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Fun mystery and hidden object game. Beautiful detail on kindle fire HD. I'm very happy Big Fish has made these for tablets too. Great price, I will definitely be playing their other titles!
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This film was absolutely MAGICAL!  Top notch acting ...and the film was well worth seeing.  For me it was like a trip into fantasy land.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is probably the craziest book that I have ever read.  I had heard people talking about it so I decided to read the series.  It was a great read but a little too crazy for me.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Have read this book about 5 times now and I still thoroughly enjoy getting lost in the fantastic storylines and characters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is probably the craziest book that I have ever read.  I had heard people talking about it so I decided to read the series.  It was a great read but a little too crazy for me.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I like nothing better than a movie that can scare me, and gross me out, this did both. not a great movie but had the two things that<br />make it great for me
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is probably the craziest book that I have ever read.  I had heard people talking about it so I decided to read the series.  It was a great read but a little too crazy for me.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Fun interesting move for a relaxing time.  Liked it, I liked the technology of adding the tiger to the movie.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|fun. nice graphics. kid friendly. great time waster. no issues with permissions so ignore those reviews. well worth the download
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Possibly worth the price to occupy your mind some evening, but not super.  Won't watch it a second time like some great movies.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This series continues to get better and better - huge fan! Excited for the next season, I am sure it will be great.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I loved the other books to this series, but this one was kind of slow. I had a hard time getting into it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good connection and upgrade is a good format.Great app but needs more international forecasts and map availability. Needs more radar use in international countries.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I so want to believe that there is more to life than death.  Your story provided an in depth look into the human mind and soul.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not quite a murder mystery and not quite noir, Gone Girl is the perfect summer read. Cleverly researched and beautifully worded. I can't wait for more from Gillian Flynn.
B000002LFU|5.0|In my opinion, REM is the best band out there.  I mourned when Bill left the group and again when the band ended but it was time for them.  I am still hoping for a reunion that never ends (including Bill).
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|Don't forget to empty your bladder before reading Sedaris. I laughed so hard my jeans were at risk.  While his family cannot possibly be that horrid, I know some that are. They just don't have any gifted writers.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|When Glee was still fresh and worth watching.  Jane Lynch is classic.  Matthew Morrison is good; wife annoying.  Students talented.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Amazing directing and dialogue and my kind of characters.  A must see if you want to see the others in the trilogy.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|A bit hard to figure out for a child, even for me. I am not a game player and it is a bit confusing but cute. I guess I just need to spend a little time at it so I can teach my granddaughters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game provides a good challenge without being frustrating. Wortth the time to download and play for anyone over 10 years old.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|ok easy reading just was not my type of book but made me wonder what my dog was  friends really enjoyed it
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Affleck really outdid himself with the team he gathered and directed for Argo. Even minute details of the 70s era were present in the movie. The flow of the story and all that happened until the six hostages were away from the clutches of misguided theocracy. First rate!
B00881VLCE|4.0|These puzzles are beautiful to look at and relaxing and enjoyable to do. The music is very pretty but wish it didn't run on such a short loop.<br />I rate this a 4.5 out of 5
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have seen the show 5 times - it is the best and the original cast was incredible.  Love it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Cute game for kids, especially after seeing the movie. It has it's limitations in terms of complexity but definitely worth the \\"free\\" app.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I don't know what's missing but with a character as deep as Lincoln's I was left wanting more, but still a very good movie.
B005HED08I|5.0|I watched the original and I'm still impressed with what they could do so long ago with so little to work with technology
B009FAQ9JW|5.0|great story along with great acting by all... what more can you ask for!  They don't make 'em like they used to.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun - not a money trap. Wish it were longer but there's a promise of more levels to come.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Ms. Kline is a great story teller and is able to make you feel you are actually living the story as she describes the characters and their stories.  The book is a novel based on historical events.
0307720950|3.0|The book is very insightful about new manufacturing techniques especially the promising area of 3D desktop printing. That said however the author seems to simplify the complexities involved in mass manufacturing and customization, this was especially glaring when he describes automotive manufacturing.<br /><br />The author in the earlier parts of the book talks about the ability of the innovator to outsource manufacturing to specialist manufacturers while he or she focuses on research and product development. He talks about this as a critical advantage which did not exist earlier. However while talking about Tesla, he says this is a disadvantage and touts the ability of Tesla to vertically integrate all aspects of manufacturing as its advantage,this is a very obvious contradiction. I also don't beleive it is fair to compare an operation that makes 20,000 cars to one that used to make 250,000 cars even if they are the same factory, the factors involved in operating a factory profitably in each scenario are very different. Also, The robotic technology that the author talks about the new manufactures using, have been there for a while and are being used by most automotive and other manufacturers. Infact the \\"Big Three\\" were one of earliest companies that helped develop and push Robotic assembly and part delivery and retrival systems. The book though gives an impression that they are laggards, while the newer car companies are starting to pioneer this technology, which is not the case.<br /><br />Now, the reason automotive companies don't upgrade the performance of a car with a software update is not because they want you to buy a new car, though they certainly hope you would. It is because of the limitations of the IC engine and other mechanical components. Also, you can only go so far without impacting the warranty and saftey requirements, if a company chooses to upgrade the performance of the vehicles it makes. But, you as a customer are free to do so at the risk ofvoiding the warranty by tinkering with the ECU, which is part of what tuning and kit companies do. I would think the electric car makers would do the same to avoid liabiliy, due to safety issues. I agree with the authors vision of software controlling performance of physical objects, the technology exists, but there are a lot of ethical and saftey issues we have to address before software drives and controls our Cars. We still need address, for example how to react or who is responsible when a moving car has been hacked into.<br /><br />Manufacturing customization is way more complicated than a robot changing its tool to do a different process. What about the different components/Material it has to use to build that different car. Those have to be stored somewhere and there has to be a plan to get that part, or steel and aluminium from Ohio, Europe, China or India to the factory. Inventory is still a cost no matter where it is, this is where you still need a supply chain no matter how vertically integrated you are. There is a reason Ford went from being a vertically integrated company to being a assembler focusing on product development. Unless a company has absolute control on the cost of everything it makes, it cannot remain profitable, and it is very difficult to have control over costs in a global economy where not everyone is playing on the same field.<br /><br />The book overall is a good overview of a very promising manufacturing future, but it generalizes too much.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I put this book down about 25% into the story. Felt that the emphasis on Adam Brown's early life challenges was getting repetitive. Something got me to pick the book back up 3 months later and finish it. Am I ever glad that I did!<br />The way that this man lived his life as a husband, father, friend, and soldier serves as an example to us all. His early life struggles also remind us that if we choose, \\"we are never out of the fight\\".<br />Thank you to the Brown family for sharing Adam's story. Thank you Mr. Blehm for telling it so well.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|This is a handy calculator but is missing many of the scientific functions that I use.  Square root, power and parenthetical math expressions would be handy.
B00004CXYQ|3.0|There are movies with plots that mean different things to different people; films that seem to move us one way or another according to who/what we are. This is one of them. The story is one of cruelty, love, talent, suffering, and joy, involving a musical savant. Another such film is &#34;The Midnight Cowboy.&#34; I have asked friends to tell me what each of these movies meant to them - how they defined the plot, etc. The answers were so varied that I suspect that this &#34;kind&#34; of story reflects something inside the viewer. I can't decide if this is good or bad, so I will simply say... if you are looking for simple entertainment, this is not your movie.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I have had a fun time with this game, but it's like any other. It is not friendly. It gives you these challenges that would not be hard if you didn't have to buy their money to complete the quests. You see they give you this challenge and you have to plant 3 to 8 rear seeds. It says ANY rear seeds. The problem is you can buy mystery seeds, cost 1200 sand dollars or you can buy another type for 20,000 sand dollars, then you can buy a real rear seed for 10 pearls. If you do not have enough sand dollars or pearls you are S,O,L. If you do have enough sand dollars to buy the mystery seeds you are not guaranteed that you will get a rear seed. It is kind of like shooting in the dark. It is a great game though. They do give you a lot of pearls. which is a big help. It seems to me if it says any rear seed if you buy them from the rear seed area and you pay that much for them they should be counted as such. I mean when you pay 1200 sand dollars for a rear seed and you get a 20 sand dollar seed That is a BIG rip off......... I would give this game a 5 star rating if not for this one problem!!!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I enjoyed this game. It's not as challenging as most and the instructions were incomplete. However, it helps with boredom.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Not very deep.  Good action.  Tony Stark gets the best lines.  Better movie than Thor or Captain America.  Not as good as first iron man, Spider-Man or batman movies.
B008CLI4N4|3.0|I love the story lines and the lush visuals.  Wish it did not show such graphic violence and sex. Will stick to the book.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|It is really fun. Easy to pick up stupid hard to put down. Plays like Donkey Kong with a Mario feel.
B0084HJE0S|3.0|It was ok it only talks about the changes between the old and new html versions. I would not recommend it
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's great but it needs to update/upgrade. I love it because it's got a lot of stuff but I think it needs more.
B000FC146C|5.0|When I read it in the 70's, I loved the story of the family and the love story. I still enjoyed those but really appreciated the description if life at that time on a huge ranch in Australia. Colleen McCullough's writing is beautiful.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|dangerously addictive. I cant pug this game down. so much fun. only complaint is doesn't always connect to facebook. other than that I love it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good fun makes you want to play all day multiple levels and things to unlock it's just a lot of fun
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book was so good, it changed my life. After reading the words, Metabolic Syndromn and Insuline Resistant, I knew living a gluten-free life was for my husband and I.  One month of being gluten-free has reduced pain and stomach problems, along with increased energy. I recommend this book for everyone in America who eat wheat products!
B002SSUQFG|3.0|I have another Seiko wrist watch that keeps perfect time. My 809 gains 2 minutes in 5 days or so. I did not expect this.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I really enjoy this series. It not only has interesting story lines but is educational on the law. Want more!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This wonderful gem of a game came to me as the free app of the day, and I couldnt be happier. The graphics remind me of a HD remake of donkey Kong country on N64. The gameplay is kind of like the old PC game Gorilla. The sound is very well done. Best of all the game has 0 zero permissions , why can't every game be like Chimpact? Loving this game!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Terrific movie, great graphics, interesting story line. What more could you want? If you are looking for a deep and meaningful movie this is not it, it's note meant to be!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but fun with a good use interface. The ads aren't obtrusive and don't distract from the game. All in all a good app!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Every time I play the game the ads get longer. Pretty soon I will have to delete it. Computers come with free solitaire and so did my phone, so I don't think it is too much to ask for on Kindle.<br /><br />I wish I did not have to give it any stars.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I really enjoy watching the movie. Very cute and fun movie ever. I might want to watch this movie again.
B006WPWH4E|5.0|It took me three tries, but I have found a free game I like. The graphics are good and it plays well. There are no ads to annoy. The action in the screen feels good.
B005DJREGQ|1.0|too morally loose and not the way I would want my teen to behave. Remember this is promoting sex, drugs and defiance...maybe some reality..such as STDs, abortions, overdose, drunk driving....
B008JFUR10|5.0|Pacific Rim is a film about people building giant robot war machines to save the world from city-crushing monsters.  It delivers that.  Pacific Rim is visually brilliant.<br /><br />What it is not:  it is not trying to be deep, it is not trying to deliver witty dialogue, it is not meant to woo you with acting prowess, it is not a movie with a twist, it is not so funny that you will bust a gut. It is not heavily dramatic or overly serious.<br /><br />What it is:  it is a movie about robots fighting monsters and people happen to be there so you get some of their stories.  Since its' spiritual predecessors are Japanese live-action and anime, you get a significant influence from Japanese movies styles. It is an action movie with humorous elements.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Could be the best of the Lincoln Lawyer series.  Vibrant characters, and the courtroom scenes crackle.  As usual, you're ready to jump into the author's next one...
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|This is an excellent movie; quite different from the Twilight series of books and movies associated with this author.  I found the story intriguing.  Underlying the basic setting of the story (aliens which inhabit human bodies) is a love story between the two primary characters.  The story is told nicely and kept my interest throughout.<br /><br />And as always, the transaction to purchase the digital video via Amazon was flawless, and the quality of the digital streaming is absolutely superb.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|I went to see this movie with my husband and was pleasantly surprised.  Although I like both of these actors, action films with political themes do not usually hold my interest...however, this film kept moving, kept twisting and turning...held my interest to the end.  I know that some of the situations were a little far fetched, but who cares?  I wanted to see something that would take my mind off of everyday situations and this film did just that!  It had comedy, suspense, and action...I sooooo enjoyed this movie and will buy it on the release date.
B00005RYLE|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for my grandson,he loved it. It was  exactly as described.  Like new condition.  Very happy with this purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|BEST.BOOK.I.READ.THIS.YEAR!! I don't normally re-read books but I will probably read this again very soon. Simply beautifully writen. Love Holder!!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I haven't ever played the game, but can tell you my grandchildren love it.  They are big Angry Birds fans as well as well as Star Wars fans.  The perfect combo for them.
B005HS4CUY|3.0|I thought I had read this correctly but I guess I read too much of the reviews instead. This is not a 3-5 disc set for each movie. This is 3D disc only for each movie. Its still an ok deal but if you want the bluray or dvd too, this isn't for you.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like the new update where the mail is on one page, rather than having to scroll to different pages looking for an older email
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy playing the game.  I used to play it years ago.  I especially enjoy the music in the background.  It's very relaxing.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I don't use this much especially for job searching becuse it is not location specific, and it keeps asking me to link with people I don't know or want to know
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like game too because it can be quick but also a challenging.  MY 5 and 7 year old love it.
1594204217|4.0|Rarely does a book make me look at the world, my life or myself in a different way. This book, as several others by this author, does just that.<br /><br />In \\"Cooked\\" Pollen posits the theory that cooking not only allowed ancient humans to enlarge their diet as they changed from a hunter/gatherer society but to change the very humans themselves. By cooking, one way or the other, those ancestors managed to do part of the work of digestion outside their body so they, like our relatives the apes/monkeys don't have to spend hours every day chewing to get the nutrients they needed from their food.<br /><br />The way he attacks the issue is to divide cooking into fire, water, air and earth. To illustrate each one, he finds an expert to teach him about the way those elements work. He learns to barbecue, braise, bake and brew and relates the usually self-mocking ways he does it wrong before he learns to do it right.<br /><br />Along the way, he gives the reader a grounding in how each method of cooking has changed and what we have both lost and gained by the change. It's not a quick read but is surely is a good one.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I didn't want to put it down. It kept me interested from the beginning to the end. Definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspenseful reading.
0345803485|1.0|To have read this series . I had no intend on reading them as i have made the mistake in the past to read the twilight books but i got cought up ih the hype AGAIN!<br /> Let me start by saying i am a heavy reader and i never really enjoyed women authors maybe because almost all of them write about the same thing , girl meets boy , boy is broken , girls fixes him, they get married have babies live happily ever after the end .<br /> Story apart here , the writting is wrong on so many levels it makes me think anyone can write a novel these days , scribel some words and pass it as literature .Writing is an art form , in my humble opinion , and to see it succumb to this is disturbing .<br /> Ok the book... so i waited and waited for a plot , any plot , other than them having sex , which got boring at some point , but nothing . Nothing ever realy happened . They had some differences but instead of talking them through just had sex instead , like that was the magical solution to everything . But for someone who is sexually active ( meaning they had sex this year !) it was just the same thing over and over again , sometimes with handcuffs , others with a tie , some balls for the vagina and so one, the same positions almost always !!!!!!!!. And i'm sorry if you cosider THIS kinky sex then you need to visit a sex shop immediately. I have no knowledge of BDSM but i do know a thing about good sex and bad sex and boring sex . This started with the promise of kinky sex but fell hard on it's face . I get it though it was written by a 50!!!!! year old women who in my opinion hasn't had sex since the millenium and almost certainly has never experienced an orgasm in her life! Because me as a 35 year old , sexualy active ,single woman  never have i in my entire adult life been told to come and just magicaly did ! Her consept of an orgasm is like the unicorn , it's pretty but DOES NOT EXIST . For me that was the most idiotic thing.<br /> So to come to the heroine ( LMAO) she is 21 a virgine and has an orgasm on the first time (???????) . My first time was awful , it hurt and it was awkward at best , no orgasm for me ( what did i do wrong?????). After that what is there more to say .I read in one of the reviews that she was potrayed as an empty shell so we could see our selves in her !!! WTF !!! I can't imagine any woman in her right mind portaying her self in Mrs. Steele . Yes i'm clumsy at times but i can take care of my self ! It sounds as the whole consept of these books is to state that women NEED a man to take care of them and should accept any crap just to be rewarded with SEX and gifts . Let him control your life in every aspect , fear him most of the time  ohh but wait you will eventualy change him because love changes us all. I know most women think they need a lost , broken man to fix with their love , but ladies in real life a man like that would kill you eventualy ( how many times have we heard on the news ). This book just glorifies abuse ,fisical and mental.<br /> The perp ahh sorry the hero i mean is just creepy most of the time . In real life he would be served a restraining order ( best case senario for him ) . I think i've made my point .<br /> Now i'm not American , i'm Greek but even i was confused as to where this was taking place , the US or England ?<br /> If you want to read it do by all means but remember you have been warned .
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have to say I have put off reading this book for awhile. I enjoy romance novels but the idea of a dominant and submissive never appealed to me. I recently joined a book club and this was the first book we decided to read. I figured I would give it a try. The writing is pretty amateur to start with, but once the story picks up you forget about it. This book did make me think. I will admit I almost put it down at one point because the red room disgusted me, but I decided to keep going. I am sad that the story really didn't end, I was hoping to get away with just reading one of the books, but I found myself intrigued and wanting to know more. I just purchased the second book with hopes of finding out what makes Grey tick. And to be honest I want to know what the &#34;situation&#34; was at the end of the first book. Although this book touches areas I am not comfortable with and the writing could use sprucing up, I am left intrigued by the hero and heroine and want to know more. I gave the book a 3 star review because the writing could be improved and although I read the story it is not one I would see myself reading again. This book will make for an interesting discussion in our book club meeting.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|These DVD's were in excellant condition. I watched all of them. I could not stop, this series is so interesting.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|A review/help guide wasn't what I wanted.....I wanted the actual game which I haven't been able to download to me Kindle Fire or Lap top.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game.  Kids just love it.  Makes them want to watch the movie again.  Would recommend to anyone that is looking for a new game to play.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|So let me get to it. This game is completely worth the money. The guns, killing, driving, etc. Is something every man dreams of. But I do have a few ideas of what HAVE TO BE ADDED for the ULTIMATE experience.<br />1. Car Details<br />Buying an Orange Sorroria isn't bad, bad sometimes I've wanted a lime green one like the Punisher's. PLEASE make it so you can paint your car a different color. And what about the police cars and ambulances? If rockstarr can get sirens for there vehicles, why can't Gangstar Rio?<br />2. Weapons<br />M16's and AK-47s are really fun and all. But where are the M60s and PKP's? And I would love to walk around with a .44 Magnum. I know I'm speaking for myself and all the other people who love this game<br />when I say you should add some of the other gun classes (Rifles with no scopes, revolvers, LMGs, miniguns and such)<br />3. More Map<br />The same old &quot;Ghetto with a few skyscrapers&quot; mini-map kinda gets boring after awhile. Why not make it so you can take a boat or a long bridge to another island where another story can go. Like hunting down Veronica Davo or perhaps a Drug Lord kidnaps Fumo and you have to rescue him. But it should be like a Skyscaper filled place unlike the other side.<br />4. Some Vehicles<br />Vehicles like the Yellow Baron and Bus should be in the store. While trains should be drivable and capable of being derailed or stopped.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|[[ASIN:159463176X And the Mountains Echoed]]<br /><br />This is one book I have read recently that kept me engaged right through. The numerous threads of the story are easy to follow though I have normally find that hard with A Kindle edition. The author is able to deal with numerous character simpathetically.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|Easy to read, would make a good movie, but no deep insight into characters.<br />Read it on a plane flight to LA from Australia!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|you have to read the innoncent before th hit. it was suspenseful intriguing and youdidn't know what would happen<br />next
159463176X|4.0|I did enjoy reading the book.  Was very easy to get into the characters.  Had a little problem at the beginning of each section as to which character the story line was following.
0767817648|3.0|Blue Thunder, 1983 film<br /><br />They show police helicopters flying. Men gather for their assignment. Is this a good assignment? They report for a 211 in progress and follow the robber with a searchlight. A helicopter's blades create a downdraft. They spot an abandoned vehicle. This is an unusual attraction at night. \\"How does she bend like that?\\" A radio call takes them away. There are shots and suspects fall; they call for an ambulance. Their manage has complaints; they are grounded. Frank's driving tells of his attitude. His girlfriend visits. The TV reports the death of a politician. Frank Murphy is suspended. Two Federal agents tell of a new helicopter that will be tested (the Olympic Games will be held in Los Angeles). It has anti-terrorist capabilities. [Is that legal?] Its 20 mm rapid fire machine gun does tremendous damage (with collateral casualties).<br /><br />Frank will do the test flight. His helicopter develops engine trouble and crashes! [Sabotage?] Driving down a one-way street the wrong way? Does Frank have memory flashbacks to Vietnam? [Note the personal conflicts added for drama.] Frank is warned about his comments to that Colonel. He flies the helicopter at night. The computer can research names, and he overhears a conversation about the shooting of a Commissioner. Is Murphy a threat? \\"Take him out.\\" Captain Braddock grounds him again. His copilot Lyman is attacked at home and tortured so he'll give up that tape! Can he escape? Who will be blamed? Murphy listens to a telephone message from Lyman. Who will he call? He calls his girlfriend to pick up that tape hidden at a drive-in theater. A police car shows up but she gets away. [A chase for action.] Two police helicopters fly near, then have to land!<br /><br />The helicopters fly along a river bed, one helicopter has to land. Frank's girlfriend is stopped. Can she get away? Will police property be destroyed? The TV station broadcasts the live news. Will F-16s be sent to shoot down the helicopter? Yes. One heat-seeking missile goes astray, so does the next one! But a small helicopter succeeds in shooting Murphy's ship. The TV station plays that tape and learns who is stirring up trouble! Who benefits from a riot that can be suppressed with military force? [Don't they ever run short of ammunition or fuel?] The pursuit helicopter is forced down. \\"Catch you later.\\" A freight train demolishes that helicopter. The death of that Commissioner is reopened due to this new evidence. [Where will it lead?]<br /><br />There are better action films. This depends too much on a mechanical item to its story. The personal conflicts between a municipal employee and Federal agents seem too contrived for me. It does provide a warning against Federal involvement with civilian authorities. Was this based on some policy in the 1980s? In 1867 the Supreme Court banned military involvement (martial law) in municipal affairs when there was no rebellion.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun game and I love the graphics unused to love playing the Oregon trail in the third grade I remember r my teacher sister June let us play it at computer time for a hour....
B004XUMMFE|5.0|That this was cancelled before even one full season is one of the greatest travesties of modern television. It's shiny!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We watched all three season's over several days.  Nice way to do it.  You can keep up with the characters better.<br />It's a well done series.  Keeps one engaged and wanting more.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|It has been my favorite TV show for six years! And the new season six is as good as always! Love it.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I'm using Verizon's VZ Security app on my Samsung Note II.  The security software tagged this app as Spyware (artemis).  Avoid installing!
B0067R0APK|1.0|As others have said, maps don't load after choosing which location you want. Not sure if this issue is just on phones or not. The only reason I keep it is the fact that I paid for it and hope they fix it. This has been going on for MONTHS  now !! Don't buy this if you plan on using it on a phone. You're wasting your money.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 is the best one yet! Lots of emotional highs and lows. Can't wait to see what season 4 brings!
B00DNLXDUW|2.0|This app does not run right on my Kindle Fire. The list of email looks fine. When I open an email, it formats the page as though it was a much larger screen so I only see the top left corner of the email. It won't let me shrink the size so I can read it at all. This happened on nine of the first ten emails I opened. Unacceptable so I deleted it from my device.
B00493E1GI|5.0|This movie is BRILLIANT. It was exactly what I needed when it first came out, and it still is.<br /><br />Ignore the bad reviews; people judge things they don't understand. This is not a romantic comedy, so while it can be funny and romantic, that is not its purpose. It's the hero's journey from myth, but with a female hero.<br /><br />Nonattachment and choosing your own thoughts, subjects covered during her trip to India, are the key to happiness and are being taught in every spiritual discipline. Nonattachment is what spiritual teachers are teaching students right now. It's ironic in the best way that the attachment she ultimately had a hardest time giving up was her new dedication to nonattachment! She was terrified of wanting something again, and making a commitment.<br /><br />She is not selfish for choosing the life she wants. As women we're taught that we're bad people if we don't dance to everyone else's tune. I thought it was the bolder choice doing what they did, maintaining the first husband's personality from the book, and making him not a bad guy. It was no one's fault, it just wasn't working.<br /><br />I've been in her position, praying for something, anything, a way up off the floor. And education is almost always the answer. Yes, the fact that the character seemed to have a lot of money made her trips a lot easier but that's not a reason to be completely prejudiced against her. Starting with physical indulgence in Rome, exploring the power of pleasure, then turning completely spartan in India and concentrating only on the spirit, she had to find out if it was possible to do both -- to live in the modern world, enjoy herself, and maintain the spiritual life she needed. She got both, and the right man, in Bali.<br /><br />This movie is perfect for anyone having hard times, someone exploring spirituality, especially meditation, Eastern religions, or simply anyone who really wants to travel. It hit me on all fronts. Watch it if you want to know more about having a larger life.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Perhaps had one more hour of gameplay would have been 5 stars. Good puzzles, not too difficult. Good hint system.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I don't know how Charlaine Harris does it, but she continues to write the most interesting and thrilling vampire books!  This is the last in the Sookie Stackhouse series and I am very sad to see them go.  I will really miss Sookie and her wild adventures!  Wow, what a ride this has been.  Thank you Charlaine!
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I enjoy shows about this time period and this one does very well at not using modern day language and attitudes.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I love Coldplay so they can rarely do wrong as in this song.it is just so right to keep you moving and having fun with this ding all the time.
B000V9WQSE|5.0|I first read this in the 80's. My co managers reject it and say they're too busy or if I use it I won't be so special and the company will get rid of me. They're always busy working in the business not on it.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|Nora Jones just puts peace and tranquility in my heart. She is songstress that is timeless and meaningful. She can calm me anytime with that voice!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Such a great project. It has that weird mixture of great writing and casting. I find it such an oddity, when you get a show with a cast that has this kind of personal chemistry with each other.
B000SW4DH6|1.0|Did not receive the item but will love it when I get it.  This is my favorite movie of all times.  Have seen it many times and look forward to receiving it.  I thought it was sold out and would be sent later.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|just got it as a free app and now its all i want to play very entertaining i would recommend it for everyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|game is intriguing. kept me interested and the tasks were difficult enough without being too hard to figure out. cool.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of puzzles, very entertaining. One of the better ones that I have tried where everything wasn't transparent and simple.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I bought this movie after reading some reviews; Warrior will not disappoint.  Tom Hardy is an actor to watch.  Hardy portrays Tommy with such under-stated realism and precision that he steals the scenes with Nick Nolte and Joel Edgerton.  Not to say that Nolte or Edgerton were less than fantastic in their portrayals as well.  Nolte pulls off Paddy with such finesse that you feel torn as a viewer whether you should betray the other characters and have pity for him or to root for his personal successes and effort.  Edgerton is charming as the caring father figure, living with guilt brother, and underdog fighter.  But Hardy has the most complex character; a quiet powerhouse fighter with a heart of gold, living with an intense sadness and pent up anger.  He is cool in his portrayal, never allowing the cliches to corrupt his delivery.<br /><br />The premise has some elements of cliche, but the writing, direction, and acting bring this movie out of the mold and create a compelling movie experience.  The story is well built up, drawing the viewer into the characters, and allowing the actors to deliver incredible performances.<br /><br />The fighting scenes were well selected, not overtly brutal but intriguing.  The movie balances the story line well with the excitement of the fight scenes.  You stay as interested in the characters and their personal victories as much as victories in the cage.<br /><br />Warrior is a fantastic movie!
B004CMBZJC|5.0|Love the show.always wanted to watch to, glad I got the chance to watch, thans to amazon. great show .good story line.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|This book was recommended to me.  However, I found it confusing to keep track of the characters; I did not think it was an easy read;  It may have gotten better, but I gave up around page 100.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so asome my whole family liked it when we saw it we got it right away I said to uninstall this app but they said no
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and very addictive. Challenges you and makes you think on you toes!! Great for everyone! Download it, you will glad you did!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I used to play subway surfers a lot but now this is the only game that I play. that is how great it is
B009EANE3M|5.0|The Script continues to put out great music, and I love the way their style has been evolving. There isn't a song on here that I don't love, as is the case on their previous albums. They've yet to disappoint, and this album is worth every penny.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved going through all 3 seasons in about 2 weeks.  It was entertaining and compelling.  Hard to believe people lived like that.  I loved when the grown children pushed back and repeatedly said, after all it is 1920!!  Nothing ever really changes except people died tragically with less advanced healthcare and less safety regs in place.  The last episode is stuck in my head and I absolutely cannot wait for Season 4!!!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I have enjoyed almost all I have read from Neil Gaiman and this tale was no exception.  It was entertaining and a good read, but it seemed to me that it was not quite finished.  Do not misunderstand me, it was fine as written, but more could have been done to develop the characters.  Overall I would recommend this to any Gaiman fan with confidence.  I sincerely hope this was not meant to be an opening for &#34;The Further Adventures of Lettie....&#34;
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Great action movie.  Decent acting and great special effects. Fun plot but nothing too heavy.  Just a good summer flick.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kid LOVES playing this game! He has not reported any issues or problems.  Its a great game! Good job!
B002NN5F7A|5.0|Classic lines all over this movie.  Great actors doing what they do best.  Kind of dark but struck a cord with me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game was very enjoyable.  I got stuck on a couple of levels, but once I got my roll on it was exciting to say the least, to see where each opened clue would take me. Can't wait for more levels.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game! I just wish it was longer. I'm looking forward to updates and new levels in the future.
1781162646|4.0|I finished Joyland 10 minutes ago. I bought it three days ago. I thought it would be a nice, fun summer read that I'd take in over the course of a week or so. However, it's Stephen King, and this is Mr. King at his finest. It became a race between myself and the pages to find out how the story would resolve.<br /><br />When I first heard about King's \\"Joyland, I was definitely intrigued. A murder-mystery whodunnit set at a carnival theme park in the 1970's? Is this Stephen King, or Scooby-Doo? Not that I was disparaging the idea; I loved it. It reminded me of the books I read when I was a kid, especially RL Stine's Goosebumps Series. Also, I love that there's no digital edition. I loved going to the bookstore, picking up this pulp fiction paperback, resplendent with its over-the-top cover art and tagline (\\"WHO DARES ENTER...THE FUNHOUSE OF FEAR!). I felt taken back to a simpler time with this story. I would only hope that this revives the bookstore medium.<br /><br />As for the story itself -- it's obvious Stephen King is on a second-wind. 11/22/63 was one of the best novels I've ever read, and this shorter (and funner) adventure continues the trend. In \\"Joyland,\\" Devin is a 21 year-old college student who is spending the summer of 1971 working at an independent theme park in North Carolina called Joyland. (Aside: Joyland reminds me too much of my own local indie theme park Wonderland, here in the Texas panhandle. Everything from the horror house, the Ferris Wheel -- I have to think Mr. King modeled his fictional park after Wonderland.) Getting over the heartbreak of his girlfriend dumping him, our protagonist makes a few friends, meets a young boy with a deadly disease and a psychic gift, and comes face-to-face with a murder mystery! All within just shy of 300 pages!<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun summertime read, pick up \\"Joyland\\". I promise you, you won't be able to put it down. Joyland is pure, unadulterated pulpy fun.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is fun to play because it has a lot more game to play I fined I go to this mahjong game to play more often then the other mahjong 2 game.
B00076NYFU|5.0|I have the original vinyl album which I purchased on my 13th birthday 38 years ago... ( Have most of their older albums also )<br /><br />  Not being able to play it any longer, I decided to buy the CD.  A trip down memory lane for sure !!!  Love It ..  Thanks Amazon. Will be back in the future to purchase more of their CD's
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. It's never has any glitches or problems where it stops working. It always works and has great graphics, you would have thought we had to pay for it, but nope it's.......FREEEE!!!!!. Indefinitely recommend this game to any age, it's a fun game to play to pass time or to just have fun on your free time. If u have a y neices and nephews or cousins they would love to play it
0792162803|5.0|This unique movie is funny and serious and totally enjoyable. Entertainment and humorous. This original  movie pokes fun at faith.
0393312836|3.0|Although a very strange novel, I think it speaks well to the nature and confusion of adolescents.  My only wish would have been if this book had come with a glossary of British slang (which I believe I read that the author had actually mostly made up).  It was pretty tricky figuring out what was going on, when the narrator used so much uncommon slang.  I'm going to give it another read though, because it was quite interested once I got going in the book.  (Perhaps I will make my own glossary nest time?)
B000002UHG|4.0|It was a needle in a haystack but good listening. Only wish he had made more albums before he sadly died.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun I love playing, plus the minions are so cute, love the game. Minion rush rocks
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|my favorite part about this game is that you dont to buy all your animals and you get to drive a jeep to catch them
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like the APP but all of the &quot;free&quot; stuff is annoying.  I just want to know the weather and all of this claim your points and &quot;gifts&quot; I could do without.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie but if I rated it 5 stars I couldn't face myself the next day.  This movie has absolutely no chick appeal-- the hero shows no trace of emotion and doesn't even remove his helmet for the entire movie!  He's the futuristic version of the Man With No Name from all those spaghetti westerns.  The violence is graphic and gratuitous and the villain is this heinous looking, brutal ex prostitute.  She is not sexy, and there is no nudity.  That's my favorite kind of guy movie, though!  Mindless violence, but without booze and bimbos.  This is the opposite of James Bond movies.  Judge Dredd does not try to be cool and suave and bang the pretty girl.  His only motivation is killing and surviving to face another day so that he could, as Hemmingway might write, die in the rain.  Awesome guy movie, but if you're the typical chick, or if you have any pretense to sophistication, I would avoid this movie like the plague.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Very typical Diehard movie. Added his movie son was different. If you like the other Diehard you will like this one.
B00CNZ17DO|5.0|Great album well rounded would buy again want to see them live would be a great show hope they come to the USA
1423140605|5.0|Love This Book! Love The Series! It's One Of Those Books You Just Can't Put Down. This Is Book 3 Of The Series You Should Read Book one And Two First.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love this game, it will keep you wanting to play. Great graphics, cool scenes. Love it love it, love it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Awesome read. One of those that you don't want to end. After reading a story like this it's hard to find Another to interest
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Minion rush is a great game with lots of action and excitement but you don't get a reward for accomplishing a achievement you should at least get like 3 bananas or son thing
B008GJV4F2|5.0|I loved the movie because it is all about chocolate! She was all about enjoying life. I loved the happy ending.
B000FBFMFW|4.0|but still lots of fun and adventure even though much of the plot revolves around the fact that our young hero is so very astute when it comes to the political machinations of the monarchy. I say this not to detract; I found it fascinating.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Kept your attention.  I have seen the boss in other movies and i always like the character she plays as a very strong women. The senior lawyer wants to win and he usually does. There is a secret between the young guy and his partner who hired him.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I found this book fascinating for its content and presentation style.  The doctor writes very well, is easy to understand while not talking &#34;down&#34; to the reader.  I don't know if I am convinced of its veracity, but it sure is an interesting read.
B007SSDBBM|5.0|A movie about time travel and what a real man is! Someone who knows how to respect a lady. He is from a time where the way you treat a women is important.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Special this weekend to get the stingray - grow ANY 8 rare plants. Spent all my $ did not get  anything
1781161097|5.0|Very nice book. Beautiful pictures. Lots of information on the making of the movie, the concept behind it. Words from the director and cast and crew.
B000002GXX|5.0|If You like any Eagles music you will like this album. The whole album if full wonderful songs written by the classic band. THere is a reason they are considered one of the best rock bands and this album is proof of that.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is fun but it crashed my Kindle. It wouldn't let me get on the app store and most of my apps. It also messed up my time and date so I had to reset it. I liked it but I don't recommend it for that reason.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|If you like Joe Bonamassa electric rock-blues sound you will love what he can do with an acoustic guitar. His fellow musicians who play along side him are equally amazing. A great overall album with a twist of unique acoustic musicianship along with down home blues-rock heart and soul.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i luved this game great for every age and very awesome, and cute for<br /> girls i guess so please get it ,and check out despicible me 2  in thearures
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This was a very good game to have on my Kindle Fire HD. No trippy lags, no black screens, and it`s not the fact that it takes a while to download. Even though I`m a boy, I like this game. 4 stars for My Horse!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I wonder about the poverty in our country today and the lives of children. The Orphan Train can remind us of the horror of some children's lives and the safety nets we must provide for the innocent poor now.
B008JFUO0Y|1.0|A very poor remake of a great movie. No Ash, no special appearance by Bruce Campbell, and they condensed parts of the other two movies into the last 15 minutes. Please do yourself a favor and watch the REAL Evil Dead movies.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It does get disconcerting when a character you really get attatched to gets slaughtered. On the other side of the coin, it's refreshing to read a story line where it can't be taken for granted that any character will survive to the end.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|How do I get rid of this. I want it off my tablet.It will not open. It is a waste of time. I am really dissPPOINTED IN THIS AND ONE OTHER i GOT TODAY. i HAVE NEVER BEEN DISSAPPOINTED BY amazon ALWAYS HAVE HAD GREAT INTERACTIONS. Sorry about the caps.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The human spirit is enhanced and advanced by the meaning of flowers.  This is a beautifully written story of how this happens when we allow it.
B0031RS44S|5.0|A rollicking good read - Reacher and his old team reunite to solve a serious crime - the murder of people near and dear to them.
B00B2TTVNU|4.0|I have been following Valentina on YouTube for a couple of years and really like what she does and her personally. So why only four stars? I actually found these performances to be a little flat.Sometimes I have seen this with musicians with amazing technical facilty (like Augustine Anievas). I don't know if she was trying to place it a little safe because of the depth of the project, but I would have personally liked to hear her own style come through more, especially in the Paganini variations where she had some room for a little whimsy.<br /><br />I still like the recording and will continue to follow Valentina. I just can't say this is my favorite interpretation of these works.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|No instructions on how to play.  Had no idea what I was doing.  Perhaps if there were an instructions link within the app...
B005544TRQ|5.0|I just love this show! The combo of Mike and Harvey with the hatred for Louis thrown in there. I really want to be Harvey's secretary. I love strong female characters.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|This was a great game but I felt I could never play it without the hints telling me what to do.  This is definitely too difficult a game for a fun afternoon play; but using the hints can get you through and does make it interesting.  If one is truly wanting to be challanged in a game, this is for you.  If you simply want to play a strategy game for fun, this may be too hard.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Love the drama! Love the irony! Love the scandel!! I can't wait to watch the next episode. My number one drama.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|I have always enjoyed playing Freecell.  This is a strategy playing game and yet it is not too complicated.  Something to while the time away while waiting in an office or airport.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|Chris throws a lot at you but it's all easily absorbed and detailed enough to help you follow through with your own research into the topics. This book is a real springboard to help inventors get a grasp of the tools out there nowadays and hopefully will help bring back American manufacturing and the old Made in the USA logo, even if now spits out of a 3-D printer.
B009R659L8|5.0|This book kept me guessing until the last chapter.  I enjoy Mary Higgins Clark books. I know it will always be a good, clean book if it's written by her
B008J05EL8|1.0|I have tried to install the font package several times and it always fails. Amazon needs to remove this product from it's site.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Bitter sweet coming to the end of a series like this! I'm so into the characters I think about them all day long! It's been all consuming finding the time to read all 3  books, but I'm glad to have the time back!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. It is a fun game to play with my son, we challenge each other. We love it...
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I am not going to say much about the story but I can say that once you start this book you're immediately attached to the characters and have a hard time putting it done.  Well written, incredible story and a flow that doesn't seem forced.  Also Anthony Ryan did not fail where others usually do, he did not implode with a horrible ending that left a taste in your mouth.  I can only hope a second book is coming shortly.  I will buy it immediately!!!
B002413TY2|5.0|What can I say Nice movie nice shipping and well Jason Statham what more can you say the movie is very nice and well the man does not do anything that I have found not worth of watching so 5 *****s
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this game a lot I just can't get passed Vector! But that's ok! I love the little minions! They're so cute!
B004HO6HWK|5.0|What can I say Nice movie nice shipping and well Jason Statham what more can you say the movie is very nice and well the man does not do anything that I have found not worth of watching so 5 *****s
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game so far! The only con about this game is the loading is a little longer than I would want it to be but I'm not complaining, I still love it!!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|One of the best modern-day violinists I've ever heard; I've lost a bit of sleep because I couldn't stop listening!
B008TTPQXA|5.0|I loved reading this book, one mans experiences with a profoundly life altering out of body experience. In this age of over materialism, especially by the scientific community, Dr. Alexander's quest to make his experience more known is one that we all should support.<br /><br />Even with the corruption of all our religious institutions, with the violence and hypocrisy they engender, its up to each of us to find a sense of the goodness of the universe, and return to the source of our belonging.
B000TETJTK|5.0|What a great jam, if you're not sure if you want this in your collection or not just go for it!

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Very good read. It grabs you from almost the beginning, and holds you till it gets to philosophical, for me at least.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|The Impossible<br /> was a very intense movie and the whole family enjoyed it. It was moving and gross. Unblievable that they survived.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is fun to play I love it never get old I play it when I'm bored so I'm going to play it right now
B00CHILW64|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone.  The story was amazing, all the actors were amazing, and the special effects were amazing.  5 stars.<br /><br />My heart goes out to the people and families that truly did live through this ordeal.
B000002B5L|5.0|He loves this CD and listens to it constantly. I don't know why, but he thinks it is absolutely great! There are some good songs on it, but I am not as big of a fan as he is.
B00005NKKV|5.0|Love it played it had fun with it and loved the songs always make me smile thanks for the songs
B0064X7FVE|2.0|To many mistakes make it not user friendly, why do I have to hunt for forecast, it should be first Thing I see. Maps are stupid

B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fun.  Keeps you going..challenging,  keeps you thinking, but still makes it fun.  When you win you have worked for it.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|love the songs and love to sing along with them brought back the times I had when I was a kid
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|i love this app the best so far all it needs is more weapons and add ons and explosives pleas.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|My husband liked the action and special effects and I liked seeing an ever so slightly improved version of the Hollywood fighting chick. Still, the evil witches are one-dimensional and the so-called love interest made me yawn.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|A documentary that moves so beautifully, it could almost not be a documentary. Most cut awkward and the live footage is often different quality. This whole piece is done really well.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|\\"A Beautiful friendship... one of the best movies of all time! Epic is the first word that comes into my mind...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Couldn't tear myself away from this series. Great cast and story. Wonderful job PBS. Can't wait for season 4 to start.
B006P96PAO|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this movie. In the day and age of too much sexual content and vulgar language this was a wonderful entertaining Christian movie. I laughed I cried I rejoiced.
B005LAII0I|5.0|We first saw this movie on a Disney  cruise and watched it three times!  When we got back we ordered the DVD and watched it twice so far.....very, very funny movie.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this game is really fun to play. i always enjoy coming home and playing this wonderful game. i hope that they make more games like this in the near future.
B003ASLJMW|5.0|I love Clint Eastwood movies, I always have. So, this was a treat. Get it, it's a classic. Not boring!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Fantastic! Harry`s biggest adventure yet (albeit his first!)  Mr. Nesbo, please keep writing!<br />Harry Hole is my favorite detective, bar none.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Very good book. Very easy to read. I saw the movie first and was surprised how different the book and movie are.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just a good read.  I would recommend that any one of age would enjoy reading this book.  Good story line.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I liked the look of the set up. Unfortunately the Google app did not get along with my IPad. It froze on more than one search.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just a really good read.  I would recommend that anyone of age would enjoy reading this book.  Good story line!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like this game. It requires a player to think through patterns and make predictions about what may or may not work. I am currently stuck on some of the level 9 puzzles, but I still like pulling it up periodically.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|For the price i think these are the best headsets i have had so far...Definitely worth it. Thanks turtle beach and Amazon
B005EJNAK4|5.0|In a plastic world where perfection and not connection is the goal, this could happen and that is what makes it good.  Bruce Willis seldom disappoints too and he did not in this movie.  We loved it and referred our daughter and fiancé and they loved it.
B00BB22GSU|5.0|I really like the way Vampire Weekend has evolved. They keep their sound fresh and always entertaining lyrics make this a great album.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I wanted this for my EDC bag and ended up putting it on my key chain. I wanted it to keep my knives I carry and use everyday sharp and ready to work....man it really works!!....it keeps my folders razor sharp and can even sharpen my hunting knives....I have stones ive used for years and this works better.....5 stars...and I Very Mutch recommend this sharpener.
B00CA9VRA6|5.0|This is a great mix of two strong performers. The vinyl is rich in tone and the music is excellent.
B0014DQSGW|5.0|Bullock and Grant at their comedic best.  Heartwarming and laugh out loud funny!  A must own for fans of either star or someone who enjoys a good laugh.
B000FBFML6|5.0|Robin Hobb is truly one of the most amazing authors I have ever read. I love living in the realm she created for these characters, and I hate it every time I finish a book because I want more. I long to see my beloved stories turned into movies but only if Peter Jackson directs and only if they're done properly.<br /><br />Love love love.
B000ICZCZS|5.0|Anyone who loves rooting for the underdog, or Hugh Grant will love this movie.  The strange, sad, yet triumphant life of one boy is mirrored by the growth of Grants character.  It's a comedy yet deeply moving and is a must have to any collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I wouldn't say its better than temple run because they both have different playing styles, but this game is excellent in its own way.
B000OV85AW|5.0|There is still controversy surrounding the author (and main character of the movie) as to the veracity of his story.  That in no way detracts from the story itself.  A heart wrenching journey through the French penal system and it's vicious past.
0062082353|5.0|Such a great story.  What an American hero. It is so sad that his life ended so quickly. God Bless him.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Very good, needed something like this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 while in the car. Thanks. Charges my phone very quickly and is reliable so far.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|The writing has started to suffer in season 3.  Most of the characters have not changed in 3 seasons. It is getting a little redundant.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This is a great addition to the series. Fallen Tree continues to make major strides with every new edition. All of the Quell games are amazing and get a little better each time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really liked this game. It kept me thinking. I sat and looked for all the little hidden places. This was great exercise for my brain.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book. Took me two days to read it because I couldn't put it down. On to the third one.
B0044XRIMW|4.0|The movie itself is perfect, but my KindleFire had a hard time keeping up with Iyar times and would glitch, or turn the movie off.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The show catches my attention with a great charisma from the cast. I appreciate the witty banter and the shrewdness of the various characters.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I loved this app b/c you can change octaves. I do theatre so this helped me plunk out the notes for a harmony that was quite hard. So worth it! I use it all the time.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|The experience of seeing this film was  very pleasant.  Since I will be 80 in three weeks, it was a pleasure  to see fine actors in a well-set, adult tale about later life with the protagonists bring something other than dumpy grandparents or silly fools
B00009QG73|5.0|This concert was performed and recorded live at the Hammersmith Apollo Theater in London on October 2, 2001.  It was part of the group's 30 year anniversary tour and featured long time members Brian Ferry (lead vocals & keyboard), Andy Mackay (woodwinds), Phil Manzanera (guitar) and Paul Thompson (drums).  Although the entire concert is terrific, I was most impressed with the first half.  We were treated to long versions of songs that would feature various players with long solos.  Mackay and Mannanera in particular really shine.<br /><br />The second half of the show features many of the group's most famous hits including \\"Avalon\\" \\"Dance Away\\" \\"Jealous Guy\\" \\"Love Is The Drug\\" and others in mostly their traditional radio ready form.<br /><br />Supplementing the band is Lucy Wilkins on keyboard, backup vocals and some killer violin.  Also Sarah Brown handles the key backup vocals, joined in the second half by Yanick Etienne who has an amazing upper range.  Chris Spedding is on second/rhythm guitar, Zev Katz on bass and Colin Good on piano.  Finally, there is Julia Thornton, a stunning blond (yes I know that is not relevant) who handles percussion, keyboards and backup vocals.  It turns out she's actually an accomplished harpist but got this gig thanks to Ferry's sound director, Rhett Davies whose wife who discovered her at a yoga demonstration where she was playing harp.<br /><br />I will also point out that although this is a DVD not a Blu ray, both the video and the audio are first rate for this medium.  The stagecraft is excellent and the various camera shots are very well done.  The audio features 3 options; Dolby Digital 2.0, 5.0 and DTS 5.0.  I went with the DTS and played it loud.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a great game I LOVE it's like real life things and it just takes my breath away
B0041KKYDI|5.0|I love this movie. James Franco is a talented actor and I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves adventure, biography, drama...<br />&#34;A mountain climber becomes trapped under a boulder while canyoneering alone near Moab, Utah and resorts to desperate measures in order to survive.&#34;
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|If you enjoyed earlier seasons of Dowton Abbey you'll probably also like this one. The dialogue is often snappy, the sets are still gorgeous, and even the nasty or classist characters all have enough redeeming qualities to make a viewer care what happens to them.<br /><br />(Mild spoiler follows) One word of warning about season 3: because of career choices by some key actors, this series leaves the impression that being a British aristocrat is as hazardous as joining the cast of the Soprano's. that said, the show handles these unexpected departures as plausibly as possible under the circumstances. That said, The final scene of the final (Christmas) episode really raises questions about where the show can go next. Season 4 may be too hobbled by these casting issues to maintain the same level of appeal. I'll certainly be watching to find out.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|Campy sci-fi in the vein of Dr. Who.  Most of the plot lines are fun to watch, a couple were more violent than necessary, but worth the watch anyway.
B00009P1MP|4.0|The title song on this CD is really the main reason I purchased it but as so many others have said here in the reviews that the other songs are easy to listen to also.  The more I listen to the other songs, the more I like them.
B007N6EUHI|4.0|The app is very functional and the definition information is great, however key elements such as alveoli in the respiratory system are missing... at least I can't find them...
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Thanks to Amazon KDP for a great and useful guide. This will make my publishing process much quicker and more efficient! Well done.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Super! can't wait for the rest of the episodes.  loved every minute of seeing it.  when is the next one?
B00C90T4QK|5.0|anything from the Buble'! Again there are songs I love and songs I don't know about yet. So much music, so little time.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|simply loved it.  looking forward to all the seasons that will follow this except found out that after season 3 there will be no more.  very disappointing
B003O86FMW|5.0|The whole series was great.  Kept me interested and couldn't want to get back to it. Sad I am done.
B007712XAU|5.0|super! can't wait for more episodes. loved every minute of this in anticipation of what was to happen next .
B000Q7B8FS|5.0|Matt Damon as always does a superb job in this film, the second film in a three-film trilogy. It picks up where 'Bourne Identity' left off. It is very fast pace and has some real surprises for the aficionado of the films brought to the silver screen from the pages of that great writer of action and suspense Robert Ludlum. He is gone now but how his books entertained me while growing of age. I have read most of Robert Ludlum books and really have enjoyed them immensely. So when the ‘Bourne Trilogy’ was brought to the screen I definitely wanted to see them, Well with Matt Damon playing the leading role I loved them. For me they were outstanding. If you have read any of Robert Ludlum’s books or seen any of the movies you will see that usually there is one heroic individual who is being sought for termination. Why? Well usually it is all about a conspiracy theory. Matt Damon in ‘Bourne Supremacy’ is a trained assassin. He is also very good at what he does but he is not a robot. He has a conscious and knows what is right and tries to do it but people will not leave him alone. So Academy Award winner Matt Damon, as Jason Bourne must finish it. This film like the other two are very tense and are non-stop action! In my view they are hits. Why? Well when you take on the establishment that is way off base you have to be very creative and always alert for your next step could be your last. But what makes this film good is the idea that there are people like Jason Bourne who regardless of the odds get the job done and we can all sleep easier at night knowing that for now we are safe.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I wasn't hoping that it would very helpful app for me. I use Ubuntu and I couldn't to fully manage files and folders in my Kindle Fire HD, but now I can it!
B001A34B42|5.0|Good seller.<br /><br />This SACD is pretty awesome though I do not think it is significantly better than the Redbook CD. Great world music and a fun listen.
B000000OSG|1.0|Use Your Illusion<br />This review covers both Use Your Illusion I and II.  I cannot believe that amount of 5 Star Reviews for Use Your Illusion I and II.<br /><br />Appetite for Destruction:  We now know that the true genius behind Appetite as not any one band member BUT rather the producer, Mike Clink. Clink successfully utilized Led Zeppelin's light and shade and fused it with 70's punk.<br /><br />Lack of Songs<br />The first single, You Could Be Mine to accompany the Terminator 2 movie was passable but rang the bell. The next single Don't Cry - sounded the death knell.  Don't Cry a shallow song tailor made for an MTV audience. Heavy MTV rotation illustrates that the videos take precedence over the songs. That's the problem with HAVING to obtain the sales, but pretending that you still have street credibility.  What made Illusion worse was that band members were criticizing other bands, boasting about their hard street lives and then produce an album that was made for MTV. The punks of the day, the emerging grunge bands had the most fun as Cobain correctly said that \\"they write these crap songs with their packaged rebellion\\" and think that they're geniuses.<br /><br />There is no point critiquing the songs, one by one. The songs are infantile and his punk angst is simply an excuse for misogynist rants (and later actual physical assaults on both Erin Everly and Stephanie Seymour) to cover his limited capacity with the English language. Furthermore, the songs on both Illusion albums were over produced; play by the numbers efforts as the band HAD to kiss MTV's backside for going overbudget. Apart from partisan fans, what song apart from Civil War is memorable without a garish video. None.<br /><br />November Rain:<br />The ultimate delusion - where Axl Rose boasted incessantly that he had written the nineties Stairway to Heaven. Really?  Why then was it written for an MTV audience. November Rain a truly pretentious number that lacks Stairway's impact. Infantile song lyrics coupled with not one but TWO, poor solo's by Slash. How many millions were spent on that one single?<br /><br />Personal Jesus<br />My favorite song at that time was Personal Jesus by Depeche Mode. Filmed in a South - Western US town inside a bordello complete with tumbleweed and senoritas ... one's that you pay for. The band members wore black leather; MTV banned 3 seconds of Personal Jesus as there was heavy breathing and a shot of a mules' behind at the SAME time. God forbid. It was the ultimate clip that set the scene for the '90's.<br /><br />Who's the bigger ASS, the Gunners OR Depeche Mode?<br />The latter a band who come across as a \\"cool and chic\\" hard rock band  who actually were a synth band that utilised sampled or \\"treated\\" guitar with a brilliant satirical video in Personal Jesus AND whose lead singer by 1991 looked like Jesus, OR, the former \\"dangerous band\\" looking stupid in a vulgar million dollar video.<br />(NOTE: Personal Jesus made MILLIONS for Warner's whereas November Rain cost millions which had to be recuperated)<br />Truly delusions of grandeur for Guns, as a pair of spectacles, shorts, flannelette shirt  and a Supermodel draped over a coffin are a poor a disguise for punk.<br /><br />Punk Pretenders<br />Punk: Ah yes, the so called punk  on Illusion. Stephen Davis is correct in saying that punk bands stand against groups who rule the charts and hence are deemed .... Establishment.  As the Gunners were the THE establishment, Who were they exactly rebelling against .... err perhaps .... Depeche Mode?  The punk on Appetite was angst ridden. The punk songs on Illusion were nothing more than band members claiming they were \\"punks\\". Please, please don't bring up Estranged.  Punk .... my a#$!!!<br /><br />1 Star ..... for a prophetic title as that's all that was left of a group that held so much promise .... Yet led to nothing but a fading Illusion fueled by one MASSIVE EGO that doomed the band.!!!<br /><br />1 Star ..... as there are only moments and no complete songs. A somewhat prophetic title as the albums should have been called Delusion ..... as thats all that was left of a group that held so much promise .... Yet led to nothing but a fading Illusion.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Couldn't put it down. This book is the definition of a page turner. I recommend it to everyone who likes The Hunger Games.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|It took a while after the movie came out for me to see it but it was worth the wait. Good story, great characters and nice job done overall.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Love it! No technical issues with download or play on Kindle Fire. Great graphics and music, with funny sound effects and animation of monsters eyes. Ready for new levels!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|When satellite would not work in a recent storm this shows us where the bad weather was and kept us safe.
B00D4FDNIO|5.0|I had been waiting for this album to be released ever since I happened to hear this song called White Noise on a radio station from Naples, Italy. Then came Latch and now several others. If you enjoy electronic and EDM this album is a must have to your collection!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I didn't think I would continue to like it after the first few episodes but I do! Gabriel Macht and Gina Torres are great. I like a lot about this show (dialogue, acting, storylines, style). It still seems odd that Harvey defends Mike so much but looking forward to that secret coming out at some point...hope it's a good reason.
B00005JLEU|5.0|It came in great condition. Great movie, and it was a good price too. I love finding good deals on miyazaki movies. They tend to be kind of expensive.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is one of the best series out on network broadcasting. Every aspect of the program sparkles! I couldn't be more pleased.
B001706I5I|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie, makes me so happy everytime i watch it, it got it all funny sweet and a very important message.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Just wonderful, beautiful scenery, funny, great characters, just enough drama, but not too much. I felt the need to spread them out so they would not be over too quickly, but at the same time I wanted to watch them one right after another.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I don't like games that make you keep paying for 'tokens' to keep playing. It was fun while it lasted
B006S08RLU|5.0|After reading the reviews I wasn't sure what to expect, but I \\"took the chance\\" and rented Amelie.  What a delicious and wonderful surprise!  Kooky, artsy, bold and breathtaking....the time flew and, quite frankly, I miss the characters now.<br /><br />An absolute charming gem!
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|It gave me a chance to see the real Katy Perry and her struggles for fame and not just an overnight success story.
B008MM9630|5.0|This is such a great game. You will find yourself lost in this game fast. It game for all ages
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is great if your trying to pass some time. It kind of reminds me of temple run but with a twist.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|the game is pretty neat. if you love iron man unlocking his various suits is pretty cool. the only downside is it's pretty lagged out on my droid. it plays well on the kindle though so I only play there now.
B00005T7I1|5.0|I saw this with my dad and I wanted to share with my son. I recommend Amazon for most all my movie purchases. I get them usually within a week, that is awesome!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I really love this guy, I now have a few of his recordings.. and I'm sure I'll buy more soon...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is so full of passion and love. I am dying with anticipation for the next. The things they have both together been learning feeling. The pictures in my mind of their time together the passion the love I cannot express the excitement I have to finish the trilogy.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This is a great way to learn  I  love it it is a great way to get a great way for the first to learn
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game. It's interactive and best of all free!! There are actual levels you can play to and rewards that are helpful.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I really don't think I can judge this book having seen the movie first.It was not a book I felt glued to and that's not good.<br />Very predictable.I liked the characters but again that's coming from the movie.
B004LQI0HE|5.0|I loved this film! The film was well thought out and beautifully shot, and pretty true to the book. Carey Mulligan is an outstanding actress. When I watched it, I almost felt like I was reading the book. Almost. Watching the movie did not give enough time for the story to sink into the soul, though, in my opinion. A journey like this needs more time for pondering than the confines of a feature film.<br /><br />Don't sell yourself short on the power of this story. Be sure to read the book either before or after the film. The story deserves to be in your head for a long, long time. Kazuo Ishiguro is a master story teller. He delivers a cautionary tale, a morality play, really, that should be on every school child's reading list. Taking the time to read rather than just watch, will allow the needed time for it to really sink in. If I were a teacher, I'd love for this to become a class project. Beautiful book, beautiful movie. Read and savor the book, not just watch the movie.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Out standing read I recommend you read all three.Its not very often you come across such a riveting series,very memorable.Theres so many twists and turns.loved the main characters,I actually became very close with them.I miss them.Thats never happened to me before.I was very sad to learn that the author is deceased.Great read
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The structure of this book is a bit confusing but does work well once the characters are established. Author is very good at beautiful phrasing . Kept me interested.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Outstanding read.The first book of the series is so good and unexpected.And what's to follow the second and third book<br />it just keeps getting better.Hated to have to end that last book.Terrific story line.Unforgetable characters.
B001N9ESQ4|3.0|A little better than the first movie for realism, but choppier. Julia D. is too thin in this movie, though!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Just started seeing ads for Planned Parenthood. Uninstalled immediately. I will not support baby killers. Very dissappointed in The Weather Channel for only caring about money and nothing else!
B001NA6096|3.0|Not as enlightening as I would have hoped, and some parts were even cliche... but I'm not sorry I watched it. I'll admit, it made me want to travel and be young again!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I always enjoy playing and it gives you fun plus it gives your Brian a nice little  work out.  Even my Grandson enjoys it the changel.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I've never played any Slender Man games before, but it got great reviews so I decided to give it try.  The only problem was I had no idea how to work the screen.  I found a walkthrough on YouTube which was extremely helpful and I thought I would share what I learned about how to play.  You use your left thumb to control walking forward (or backward).  Use your right thumb to look around and turn the way you are going.  If you want to stop and look around, then just release your left thumb so you are standing still.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Lots of play options. Never bored. Awesome game! Highly recommend for anyone. Good supply of tickets ... unlike other games no need to purchase tickets or coins.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|My only complaint is that sometimes it's a little slow to load the videos.  It doesn't allow enough buffer.  The way I get around this is I pause the video before it start and let the buffer fill before watching the video.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book. Full of action and the story moved along quite rapidly. Looking forward to this next one now.
0375703764|1.0|Read the whole thing and regret the endeavor.  A classic case of gimmicky crap being mistaken by the masses as progressive art and modern \\"experimental\\" creativity.  If you're into trying to find and decode secret messages, you may enjoy the ride, but for me it was a tedious journey with very little payoff and just seemed forced.<br /><br />Skip
B003L20IHE|4.0|Gave this as a gift as it seemed like a good love story.  Have not watched it myself but heard it was good
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I hate it.  Terrible to use.  Map is just plain useless.  Drains battery and takes forever to load.  Will be deleting.  Bring back the old app!!!
0143118420|4.0|Bought this as a gift.  Hopefully it was well received. Had heard reviews on it and the report was good.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good entertainment and fun to watch.  No Hollyood progressive propaganda in it.  Only negative was Morgan Freeman, he was a bad choice.for the role; would have been better cast with Bruce Willis.
B0042816YK|4.0|Also gave this as a gift along with the book.  Sometimes fun to compare different medias.  Hopefully a good one
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|cute and educational. random clicking with not much thought. reminds me of Sims. only downfall, there is no help section. would like to play a game without being encouraged to spend money.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I enjoyed this very much at some points it really challenged me and I had to get help. I look forward to the next challenge
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is absolutely amazing its supper fun it combines temples run sub way sufers and other fun things.its a good app.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great!<br />I enjoyed it from start to finish.  Hope the others are as good as this one.  The pace is perfect.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very good and useful Android Apps. I give it two thombs up. Recommand to everyone with Android Devices.<br />It make reading more joyable.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My children and I can play this game for hours.  Highly addictive and great graphics.  The more points you earn, the more powers you can buy.  We compete with each other to see who can go the farthest.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Wasn't anything like the book. It would've been nicer to see them be more accurate over several movies in a series than cram everything into one and not be accurate. The movie was good but it made me wish I hadn't read the books.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|At First glance, I didn't think I would enjoy the book.  It took a couple of chapters before I truly became engrossed.  The main character has a dark and tainted past and I was just as interested in solving the mystery of her past as I was in solving the murder mystery. Great Read!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|A little hard to understand the thick British accents but I love the story line. It really accentuates the issues of that time period.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I downloaded this game on my kindle and was not very impressed.  Graphics were not good and the game was boring.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I downloaded this app and as soon as I started playing it on my kindle fire hd it froze. Now my kindle is frozen. I am deleting this app. Im looking to get my money back.<br />.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Great Graphics!  I enjoyed solving the Mystery.  Pretty easy with hints in case you get stumped.  Would play this game again and games similar to it.  Was worth the purchase.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Some might call this CD eclectic, but the lush sound that Lana Del Ray has crafted is incredibly distinct and definitively classic... Sometimes her lyrics can be taken as sounding depressed, but I feel that they are more the result of a deep introspection rather then despondent. Overall I love delving into the world that is created within the context of this disc and would recommend it to anyone with an open mind.
B005R9HK8O|5.0|This book tells of Richard Alberts journey to be Ram Dass. It also tells of God and endless love. Namaste.
B009K72G8I|5.0|I watched this season with my three children, ages 5, 7, and 11.  An exciting story and suspenseful plot made this awesome.  I even have to confess that I nearly cried at the end of the season finale!  Wish we would be seeing season 6 soon.
B00ATP24NW|5.0|I enjoy their music and  like how different their songs are from each other. They don't all sound the same.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It is all hidden object with no puzzle solving. It gets a little repetitive.  Graphics are good. The basis of a story line is there. The game could be so much more. it's not bad for free, but I would rather pay for a more interesting game. Also don't like push for Facebook sharing. I don't pester my friends with my game playing.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game. I like how it's a mix of temple run and subway surfer.<br />Thank you for making this game!!!!
B003XQM2YU|5.0|I'm never disappointed with any movie Russell Crowe is in. I know the story of Robin Hood has been told in many movies, but this is the best!
B005NFWCSK|5.0|This movie was great.  Lots of action and we get to see the back story of many of the characters. I love all the x-men movies!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|It is mostly a long boring story with funny quips by the main character.  DeMille just lost me as a long time fan with this book.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|I liked this game until suddenly it erased all my progress. I haven't played it much since then. It's a fun game, but for me, it wasn't something I could see myself playing often. The tilt-screen controls were wonky and controlling by touch was a bit better, but stll sometimes annoying.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark never disappoints. She is an wonderful writer that I will continue to follow! If you like mystery, she is the one to read.
B007MG360G|3.0|Just like the other Doodle games, Doodle Farm is the same. It's fun and simple. There's really not much more to say. The Doodle games are a good way to pass time and some of the combinations make you really think on what would make what.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I have trade other apps like this before and what I have to say is this app is batter then those other. The number one thing like about this app is, it lets you play video on the laptop and tablet. I'm miss more and see what I can do with this app.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Well, it's Doodle God. The app where you combine two things to make new things. Simple and fun and addictive. Great way to pass the time.
1401937268|5.0|I love these tarot cards, they are really great and very on point, I greatly represent these tarot cards. And I also love the picture on them and also the color.
B005XI94HY|5.0|One moment she's reminding me of Sarah McLachlan, and the next it's Linda Rondstat.  The music is dramatic, sweeping, with tribal percussion and a great sense of pop bombast.  It's tough to STOP listening to this album.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I like this game and a great app. I represent this game because it a fun game to play and enjoy
B00475CB1K|1.0|I love this movie BUT I didn't check for what country it was for. Thus I couldn't play it and it was a waste of my time and money. very disappointed. Always, always check that when purchasing online.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is amazing. I play it everyday, it has great graphics and works perfectly<br />on  my kindle fire HD.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love romantic books but I don't like knowing what's going to happen next. This book had some twist but still didn't keep me on the edge of my seat.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Only just started reading this author and am most impressed.  Will certainly continue reading his books. Look forward to the next book
0307341577|5.0|Where does Gillian Flynn get these ideas?!  My friend and I both read  it and were pulled in at the moment we started. She is a great writer with an amazing imagination. I want to read everything she has written!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just amazon could provide such a simple necessity and add it to my home screen. Never look for a calculated again
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|A brilliant film version of an excellent musical, it really tugs on your heart strings, and makes you want to sing-along to the glorious songs. Great acting in the midst of the singing, by the way. Russell Crowe may not be the best singer in the world, but he does try his best, and he does act with the conviction and then the uncertainty of Javert. Jean Valjean, as played by Hugh Jackman, ages gracefully throughout the movie, becoming a noble man, and Anne Hathaway is great as Fantine. The Thenardier couple, played by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, are the right comedic notes necessary to sustain interest in the movie, and Eddie Redmayne as Marius and the rest of his revolutionary friends are absolutely tragic/brilliant, not to mention Eponine, wonderfully portrayed by Samantha Barks. A great movie version, despite the changes, and the close-ups.
B000QJM8Z0|5.0|i have probably read this book three or four times over the years. it just always cracks me up! super easy read. great for when you want something fun and light. we all need those sometimes.
B00D0OR5EC|5.0|I bought this book since I loved the movie and wanted a little more back story on it. This is a must read for women.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love pinterest. i took my sweet time checking it out, but it is such an awesome idea and super convenient to keep all those things you see online organized and in one place!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is way better than the first ever subway surfers because the first one was okay the second one was better and then it got really good from as smkkelly04
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It had a lot of quick wit funny lines. It was fun until toward the end, then for me it kinda went off the rails.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is so cool . I wish I was in the game. is a really good thing for kids to play.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This season pulled his Sister (Debra) deeper into the action.<br />They are now a team, almost like a vigilantly Bonnie & Clyde killing machine.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is like a better version of Subway Surfers! I recommend this game if, 1: You are fast with your fingers or 2: Like running games.
B008M9PHWM|5.0|Bob grew right along with us into old age. Still love his songs.<br />Seller shipped fast. So glad to be able to buy vinyl and keep adding to my old collection. Gave the extra cd to the kids.AAA+
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is so fun all my friends have it on their mom's and dads iPad now I have my own kindle fire and subway surfer was the first app I got!
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Kids like to learn about going to the store, this app teaches them about the shopping for groceries like mommy does. It's just like being in the real store, they pick their items, gets it scanned and pays for it. They even get to help the store clean up the aisles and messes.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The most recent update totally changed the user interface.  It is nearly unusable now.  Why would I want to screenshot my forecast?
B00D8RYV52|5.0|Kids can build and decorate their own vehicles and see it drive to the finish line. What better way to watch their creation in action.
B0094M2O7C|4.0|Some interesting new vectors for the plot, plenty of good action.  The giant werewolf was a bit much, and how he was removed and a lot of the other action was a bit too predictable, but if you like the franchise this is one of the better episodes.
B0001BKAEE|4.0|I do not the particulars of purchasing the DVD. It was a gift for my son. I did see it and it was good.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|One of the cleverest reboots of a franchise ever, and best of all they seem to have finally and permanently removed William Shatner and all of the other hangers-on from the original series, except Spock, which can be forgiven. The references to the original series are still there to keep things oriented, but just enough off-kilter to make it clear the new Star Trek can go in any direction it wants.
B00D37UQ1K|2.0|Stephanie Meyer should have quit while she was ahead with this one. \\"The Host\\" is her best novel, in my opinion, and I can't even blame Hollywood for doing this to her story, since she produced it. I'm an avid reader and know better than to expect a film adaptation to provide everything that a 600 page novel can deliver. What I do expect are recognizable characters and plot. I *hope* for visual elements that flesh out a story and make up for detail that won't fit in an hour and a half. What I got was a retrofit that turned a thoughtful story with highly developed (adult) characters into a teen paranormal romance. Melanie's mental voice was very annoying, totally out of keeping with the way the character is presented in the novel. If this was how Meyer envisioned the character, I like my interpretation a lot better. I gave the movie two stars instead of one because the last fifteen minutes finally captured my attention.
B0094M2V7U|4.0|if you have been able to suspend your disbelief enough to like Underworld, you will like this. Good action, CGI, what you expect from the franchise.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great Book!!  A GOOD thriller with a real twist!~<br />I highly recommend it to those who like thrills and mystery!<br />A real twist in it.....
B009LREA1S|5.0|This is another essential part of the trilogy with Christian Bale's batman.  It will finally erase the memory of George Clooney, Uma Thurman and Arnold Schwarzenegger from your eyeballs if you had the misfortune to see THAT version of Batman.
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|Ever since producer Kanye West decided to step from behind the boards, he's made one thing clear- expect the unexpected. While he has been accused of being an egomaniac and self-indulgent, no one could accuse him of making the same album twice. His first album \\"The College Dropout\\" was a tribute to the golden age of hip hop, but he didn't stop there. He enlisted the production talents of Jon Brion (Fiona Apple, Aimee Mann) for his sophomore album- the orchestra driven \\"Late Registration\\". His next album \\"Graduation\\" was largely inspired by the stadium rock of the late 80's. While things seemed to be going great, he lost his mother and his girlfriend simultaneously, which resulted in the lament heavy \\"808's And Heartbreaks\\". In 2010, he released his most ambitious project yet- the progressive rock inspired \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\". In spring 2013, Kanye retreated back into the studio for the recording of his fifth album. He brought in producer Rick Rubin as an executive producer to oversee an album that was inspired by industrial music that was made by the likes of Nine Inch Nails and Ministry. After a month of recording, he released the stripped down album \\"Yeezus\\".<br /><br />Joining Kanye for the production of the album is the French electronic music duo Daft Punk. On the album, they produce almost half the songs- the brief opener \\"On Sight\\", the politically charged \\"Black Skinhead\\" and the commentary on race and consumerism \\"New Slaves\\". Daft Punk also produce the song \\"Send It Up\\" which features an appearance from newcomer King Louie. Kanye intertwines his ego with his celebrity status on \\"I Am A God\\", and teams up with Chief Keef and Bon Iver lead singer Justin Vernon on the song \\"Hold My Liquor\\". On the song \\"I'm In It\\", Kanye gets graphic on the song as he mentions various uninhibited sex acts. \\"Blood On The Leaves\\" employs a vocal sample of Nina Simone's cover of Billie Holiday's \\"Strange Fruit\\" while the song deals with the subject of an alcoholic fueled love affair gone wrong. The album closes with the best song on \\"Yeezus\\"- \\"Bound 2\\", a dark love song with a brief appearance from The Gap Band singer Charlie Wilson. Overall, \\"Yeezus\\" is another experimental album from Kanye West. While it's different from its predecessors, it's an album that could have been improved. Aside from the forgettable lyrical content, the production sounds rushed and unfinished. Had he taken a little more time on \\"Yeezus\\", Kanye could have made a much better record.c fueled love affair gone wrong.

B004XIZN5M|5.0|Iam a personal trainer myself so iam always reading fitness related books what i learned here is that there are alot of books out there that try to imitate paul wades way of teaching however imitators is all they are this is the real deal get this book it will be all you ever need.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is the best book out of the whole series.  I love Bella' s gift the way the hook tells it.  I just wish she would write more maybe one about another love triangle Jacob Nahual and Renesmee.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Are there any NEW Extras on the Blu-ray? I purchased the VHS collection but was disappointed in the Extras. I was looking for something about the making of Parts I and II that was not there.
B00B5AP7NY|4.0|My kids (and me) love the Lego games. I think they are brilliantly done. This movie is just an extension of the game which is great. They watch over and over again.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Hilarious - quirky and cleverly makes this completely impossible fantasy seem plausible. I giggled throughout the whole book. Would be a good holiday read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would recommend this show to anyone who is searching for a television viewing with substance.  The series was recommended to me by someone I wok with, and while it took some time to get through S1 E1, I'm glad I did.  There are characters that I love such as Anna and Bates, and some I love to hate - O'Brien and Thomas.  I read some of the other reviews in which the viewers were upset by characters being &#34;killed off.&#34;  What they and others should keep in mind is that death is very much a part of life even in affluent families - think of the Kennedys.  It's sad to see them go, but in order to give a realistic aspect of life, death has to be a part of it .  Can't wait to see what unfolds in Season Four!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game!!! my mom went crazy because I could not put this game down! I cant wait to play the next one!!!!
B0067R0APK|5.0|We have this app on all our devices. It's spot on for all our weather needs. Definitely worth it. Even the free one is great
B00006JIA4|5.0|I gave it as a gift to a good friend, and everyone else at the party wanted a copy too!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Is an easy, fun book to read, i will love to see more work like this, congrats to Pam Grout,
B00821OX98|5.0|I was skeptical when I heard about this show, mostly because Noah Wiley has done so many flops despite his incredible talents. But I was very wrong. This show is exciting, its characters deep and interesting, and of course the syfy elements that I love.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Fun little game. Hard to put down. Good graphics and fun that you keep going further and seeing different stuff.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|An excellent keyboard with superior accuracy. I would give it 5-stars if it would add Chinese to its language options.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|Supper fun. Love the graphics and seeing my profit. Sound effects are funny too. Totally worth it. I got free free on a special glad I down loaded it.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|This game is a favorite with my family, and I love being able to play it on my Nexux 4. My family has gotten fairly good at it, and can beat the computer most of the time at the highest setting. I wish the AI on this game was better.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I love the story and the animation, but when I bought the book for $8 or something like that I thought I got more than just a very short comic.  I feel slightly ripped off.  I want to continue the story but feel the price is way too expensive
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I like SiFi so I liked this movie. The story is good and there are enough changes in direction to keep your interest. I was happily surprised with the way the movie ended.
B0085OEA9U|5.0|Probably the cast was the best part of the movie.  The timing was good and story line was unique.  If you are a frequent traveler, the movie can be especially entertaining.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|I thought the story of this movie was very good and believable in the beginning. As time goes on and the story unfolds it becomes very unbelievable and fairly wild. But if you like the shoot em up, blow em up movies, you will like this one.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is awesome for keeping in touch I could get I. Touch with my friends and family all day every day all the time and any time I want this is the most awesome texting app I've ever seen thanks KIK
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I can't wait for the final of the trilogy to see what happens to the characters.<br />I kind if know what happens in history
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Very informative book!  I shall keep it as a reference. Should be read by anybody who has a family member that is dealing with  dementia.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Have tried and rejected dozens of these games. This one is actually a keeper. Very responsive and visually attractive too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun way to spend a few extra minutes throughout the day. If you like a small challenge., this app is for you.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Disappointed how we can open cloud city after latest update..it crashes the game.  I keep searching the internet for a fix with no mention of the issue...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Compelling, unusual, innovative, with lots of surprising twists and turns. Great interpersonal analysis and atypical characters, leading to surprising outcomes
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  The end is quite unbelievable, but it seems that is quite common with action thrillers.  I like David Baldacci's books,  I am a fan.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius at his musical best. Great CD with really authentic songwriting. Several tracks have become a favorite already. This will be in rotation for a long time.
B004GYY714|4.0|This is a great app that allows you to find the genre that you like & listen to stations from around the world.
B0020M99LC|4.0|Instead of making a movie fully focused only on action, this movie has an interesting storyline. It feels like a real James Bond movie.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|wonderful to hear her sing again .<br />not all here music is my style, but that voice<br />made it all worthwhile
B00CSJYYO4|3.0|I simply don´t like his style. It is simplistic. After a while, it gets boring. However, many people like him, and I respect that.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A lot of fun and makes you think. Great ambience with music and visuals. Well worth the price. Really enjoyed it!
B0047Y17P2|4.0|so glad i started reading michael connelly.....the characters are awesome, the stories are fun....can't wait to finish all of them.

B006QRQVMC|5.0|Update 6/3/15: This review was originally posted in 2013 under a listing for the UK Boxed Set that has since been removed by Amazon. I have deleted that review and re-posted it under the current listing. Please note this was written prior to the release of the Hogwarts Collection, which is why that set is not referenced in my review. That said, my opinion and recommendation of UK set remains unaffected. Original review follows:  This review is specifically for the UK Blu-Ray set, which is Region-Free and &#34;should&#34; play on any North American Blu-Ray player. For the record, I have a North American 120GB PS3 Slim, and all of the discs, movies and special features alike, played flawlessly.  Two things in particular attracted me to this collection over its US counterpart. First of all, it's cheaper. The price of the US set has come down in recent months, but this one is still less expensive as of this writing. Better still, there is more content in the UK version. For those of you who don't know, this set is basically a compilation of the individual releases of each film. While the first five films were released as single discs, the last three were 2-disc sets (with, as you might expect, the movie on the first disc and the special features on the second). The US version omits the special features discs for the last three films, but they are included here. Now, obviously, this collection is not as comprehensive as the Ultimate Editions or the Wizard's Collection. There are no extended cuts or 3D versions here, and since the early films were limited to single discs, the extras are somewhat lacking. But for the more casual Harry Potter fan like myself, you're getting all you probably need for under $50. FYI, as of this writing, it is actually slightly on Amazon UK than it is here, including shipping.  I have no complaints about the video quality of these discs. I'm sure the early films would've benefited from having separate discs for the special features thereby allowing for a higher bit-rate for the movies themselves, but they look fine. The later films, having more room to breathe as well as simply being newer, look fantastic. I have yet to experience the lossless audio options as I have an older A/V receiver, but the lossy Dolby Digital and DTS tracks sound great for what they are.  I will say that the packaging could have been better. The set comes in a cardboard slipcase housing four Blu-Ray cases containing two movies each. This is fine, but the hinges on the disc trays are a bit flimsy and the fourth case, which houses the two Deathly Hallows movies, is unnecessarily thick with a lot of empty space for the discs to be jostled around and become dislodged during shipping. Fortunately, this didn't happen to me, but I'm sure it easily could have.  That minor complaint aside, I couldn't be happier with this purchase and would recommend this collection to anyone who wants the Harry Potter movies but can't justify the expense of the Ultimate Editions or the Wizard's Collection.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love it but,when i go on new game it goes to the home screen.But otherwise its a very good game.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|This is a great series. The characterizations are unusual and complex. In regards to the filming, the deep color saturation makes every frame worth watching over and over again.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Had a lot of success buying through ebay ,they are easy to deal with and any problems are dealt with promptley
B005DJREGQ|4.0|The characters are actually pretty interesting to follow. The bully is quite original and her execution style is unique. I'm definitely watching more of this.
B00003CX8N|4.0|I gave this otherwise brilliant movie four stars because it begins and ends with action that took place well after the book the movie was based on and when I transferred the material from VHS to a blank DVD I edited it out. If they would make a movie out of The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street, then it wold be appropriate. I loved the book 84 Charing Cross Road, and found the movie with Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins just as good. To watch a frustrated scriptwriter in Brooklyn, New York, try to find the kinds of books she wants is completely understandable. When she cannot find what she wants in her country, she answers an ad from a bookseller in England, London to be exact. There begins a trans-Atlantic relationship between her and the rather stuffy manager of the store. It took a while for someone of Frank Doe's position to get used to the rather Earthiness of Helene Hanff but it does happen. You really do wish the two could see each other, but his duties and families on one side of the Atlantic and her lack of funds to fly over there made it impossible. Still, they had their exchanges through the mail to form a bond between the two. Even though I had read the book and knew what was coming, it was difficult to handle, but the movie treated it with respect, and made for plenty of teary-eyed moments. Have a hanky present as you are sure to need it.
1932907009|5.0|Oh my sweet JESUS!!! My script which was 105 pages fell write into place after I read about his BEAT SHEET! Everything fell right into place and of course a rewrite. But it made my wounderful story even more wounderful! I was also able to place my transitions and shots in. At first I didn't. I've read directing on page is a turn off. But if Blake Snyder does it.... hey. This wealth of knowledge also ended my script at a perfect 110 pages! Thank you Mr. $nyder. I did that dollar sign on purpose. That's what I expect now. Money making $cripts!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Very happy with the purchase. I've been meaning to buy these recently, and instead of looking at a Best Buy or Target I decided to check on Amazon first. Found this for a good price, and it met all the expectations.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this product to anyone else simply looking for the entire Harry Potter collection for a good price.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My friend showed me this game and I started playing and now I am kind of addicted to the game so yeah try it
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I was so excited to find a Magic 2014 Kindle app that I beat all the free levels right away and for the first time ever, decided to purchase a full game of something. I love the ability to pay on the go with my Kindle Fire HD and I like this platform interface even better than the console version. Good job WOTC!!!

B008DW6VOQ|5.0|this app has access to most of the necessary financial information I use on a daily basis.  It is fast and efficient to find information.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Gave this as a gift to my dad and he loves the music. Michael Jackson created a great album that many will love.
B002KKCVQE|5.0|Pair is perfectly adjustable and formed well for comfort  Excellent for summer activities and water wear. Highly recommend these Sandals.
B004SEUIWY|2.0|Two con-artist brothers with vastly different accents are finally brought down by a crazed French commander, General Vavarin Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce) and his blood thirsty henchman, Mercurio Cavaldi (Peter Stormare).  After who knows how many years of bilking unsuspecting villagers, these two charlatans are brought to task for their crimes.  On a rash claim that they can help a village recover 11 missing girls, the brothers are set free to do just that.  Naturally, things don't run smoothly.  Things go from bad to worse as torture is employed, the brother's coworkers lose their heads, a kitten has a bad turn, and a queen/witch pops up at the very last minute.<br />This is a perfect example of tons of money being spent on gorgeous sets and costumes while precious little was left for the script.  The casting errors were another problem.  Gilliam wanted Johnny Depp but got stuck with Matt Damon instead.  Robin Williams was slated to play the crazy Italian henchmen but obviously didn't.  Nicole Kidman was supposed to play the Mirror Queen but couldn't.  The characters were challenging in any regard.  Damon managed to turn Wilhelm Grimm into a pompous twit who verbally abuses his brother relentlessly.  As a grinning overly greedy creep, it's impossible to find anything redeemable in his behavior.  While poor Jakob Grimm (Heath Ledger) comes across as a sad witless buffoon easily victimized by his overbearing brother.  The rest of the characters are all archetypes that don't stray from their underdeveloped stick figures that might have looked better on paper than film.  The prevailing aesthetic throughout this movie is grotesque, gruesome, and very grim indeed.  However exquisite the film looks, it can't get beyond the unpleasant nature of the approach taken by Terry Gilliam.<br /><br />Yes, the Grimm fairy tales were cautionary in nature and thus unflinching in their approach.  They weren't, however, nasty and repellent.  This movie is less fantasy, more nightmare.  And while I appreciate some brief moments of excellence, overall, there was just too much that reeked of disparagement and therefore impossible to enjoy.  I was never happier than when it was over, never to be watched again.d while I appreciate some brief moments of excellence, overall, there was just too much that reeked of disparagement and therefore impossible to enjoy.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is a great series.  The price was really great and I had forgotten many of these episodes.  Great purchase.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Not sure why this album gets some negative reviews. The 2nd Law is fine example of what Muse do so well: Epic & sophisticated modern rock with touches of electronica. Heck, even one of the Cylons from the original Battlestar Gallactica makes a vocal appearance on the title track. How cool is that? And the lead off track (Supremacy) is worth the purchase price alone. This is a fantastic album from a fantastic group of musicians. I have no complaints.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is one of my sister's favorite movies.  She can watch the end over and over.  A great family movie
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season has the most emotionally charged episodes thus far....can't wait to see next season! Wouldn't dare give the details and spoil it for anyone!
B0038LB4TE|5.0|Jack Reacher is as tough and fair as usual. No surprise. Child's writing is itself as efficient as usual. A must read Reacher.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is a great game for all ages!  There is no adds that pop up so<br />that is great as well! 2.99 is a great price, and is worth it! Have fun with your app!

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Really fun to play and entertaining. Id play this game on roadtrips anytime. Fun to play with friends and see who can do better.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I liked it but I felt bad sometimes because of how bad people can be. Live is very hard for some people
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Fascinating story with a different look at war.  It reminds us that we are all human.  I was caught up in it from the start.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a kind of a book that keeps on edge, plots and lies is something I love. Recommend it
B008RA3X5E|5.0|this is great, just when I needed an alarm clock (mine broke), there it was so I downloaded it and just 2 days later I used the alarm and it worked just fine.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|The book is very well written an could almost not stop reading to see the end, but then I wanted more, I want to know what now
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|For me, Hopeless was hard to get into at first. I just kept thinking it was another young adult book with the girl falls for the bad boy, then the bad boy breaks her heart for some strange reason. But boy was I WRONG!! This book has soooooo much emotional upheaval to it, I didn't know which was up or down. It is such a unique story that I fell in love with it once I was done reading it.<br /><br />Sky has had a pretty sheltered life. She's been home schooled all of her life, and she's a senior now. She's also never had any type of electronic device such as a t.v, cell phone ect. You get the point. So now she's finally going to get to go to high school. And her best friend is going away for the year so she won't have anyone there she knows. They both don't have very good reputations even though Sky's the type of girl who doesn't give a crap about that it doesn't help earn her friends when she starts school.<br /><br />But she does catch the eye of one boy whose been away for the last year. Things start to change for Sky when she and Holder start to form a relationship. At first it's just friends because neither one of them knows how to deal with the connection they feel. And they have a whole lot of drama with Holder's mood swings, and Sky being a little bit afraid. But they do start to have a nice relationship, until all kinds of secrets are revealed.<br /><br />And let me just say HOLY CROW! Major Major Major plot twist. I seriously never saw this coming. I've never read a book like this, and It was just that awesome. I highly recommend this book, and I can not wait to read more.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Get the biggest HD screen you can find, then sit back and prepare to be awed.  Director Ang Lee raises the bar for movie eye candy with this tour de force in special effects.  A captivating story runs a bit long and almost runs out of gas before a thought provoking ending that will stay with you for a while after the movie is over.  Worth the little bit of tedium along the way to get to.  Certainly recommended viewing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this season and the previous two seasons.  Can't wait for season four in October.  It is a must see. I have not seen any of the seasons until they had the walking dead preview over the weekend and go hooked.  I've seen it all and now I am a fan!!!
B004LROMWU|1.0|I watched the 1st part on this dvd & started falling asleep... I thoiught with all the great reviews that it would be better in the 2nd part, same thing started falling asleep again. I have no idea what those people with the good reviews were watching, It couldn't have been this boring waste of a movie I wouldn't think.<br />I would not recmmond to a friend...
B0063IH60K|4.0|You know what I mean? Not what I was expecting. It's a game with cards. Why didn't somebody tell me that?
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The book is great following the story of the other two books.<br />I can't put it down.  This is one of the best group of books that I have ever read.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|His movies rarely disappoint. Even when he screws up, he shows we all have two sides, and none of us is perfect.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is a real gem. It's astonishing how this book was self-published by the author and has gained so much momentum and is now a best-seller. Go Hugh Howey!
B001DUDKEY|1.0|I'm sure it is a good movie, but could not follow it.  Maybe you will do better.  Good luck!  Enjoy!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this... Keeps you engaged.<br /><br />The plot is good and performances are great!<br /><br />Can't wait for next season to start.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Tons of drama, a compelling story, and quick witted humor. What's more, all of this is delivered at rapid pace. What more do you want?
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a fantastic read! It really got me thinking and it wasn't like a normal, boring, predictable novel. It had a big plot twist that I wasn't expecting at all. Lots of big words too but I really liked that aspect. It got me thinking and it was far from boring. Loved it and recommend it for anyone and everyone!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game!! It is super addictive and lots of fun!! I have to fight my husband for my ipad in order to play it.

0307341577|4.0|After reading &#34;Gone Girl&#34;, I thought I couldn't possibly find another Gillian Flynn novel to equal it.  But I'm finding &#34;Dark Places&#34; comes very close to keeping me intrigued.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Second time playing got a high score over 11 thousand you should get it it is an awesome game I have a blast playing it I also play on my mom's phone get it or you'll be sorry
B004EPZ034|5.0|I had bought the movie for a friend,she watches really a lot plus enjoys the movie an awful lot.  She enjoys the movie to the point to where it many times.
B00846REIS|3.0|This was so similar to Fifty Shades.. just different characters.  Will not be purchasing the other two books in this series.  Might get from library but will not pay for them.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|well I am 3 weeks into the fast diet and I think it is great!  put on weight this week but had a million birthday parties so would have been far worse if I wasn't fasting.. do need to trim back on what I am eating for the other 5 days.. but loving it so far.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Poor story, worst acting and this was nomated  for what award?  Even the music was out of left field.  Good thing I did not pay to watch it at a movie theater.  I would have demanded my money back.  I did want to give one star.  I think I need to to get this review attached.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Watched the first few tv episodes of the King & Maxwell Series airing on TNT this summer and decided to try reading the book series. Just finished the first ebook while traveling on several long cross-country flights. I highly recommend the books if you like Baldacci's other mystery series. There is fast-paced action along with several plots to follow so you should be highly entertained!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Broke my kindle a while back but haven't found the need to replace it when I can use my phone or my tablet for the very same purpose.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|The behind-the-scenes look at theater is so interesting. The music, dancing, and voices are fabulous. The story is very good and the characters make you love them one minute and not the next! Funny, fun, and educational. Who could want anything else? I love this show.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app, it truly does help to relax, sleep and concentrate. It has really helped with my insomnia problems.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Kind of reminds me of Tracey Chapman. I would recommend the album. A lot of the songs have a social message.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|The origin of naming an English estate building \\"abbey\\" comes from Henry VIII giving confiscated Roman Catholic Church property (an abbey or a friary or a monastery) to English nobility (the aristocracy), as a reward for service to the king or, in the case of very powerful nobility, for simply supporting Henry in his \\"Great Matter\\", which was his quest to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, which lead to the separation of the English Catholic Church from the Church of Rome. The producers really should have sought out a structure that actually looks like an abbey (which Highclere Castle doesn't) or had Julian Fellows change the name of the estate. None of this makes a particle of difference, of course, to \\"Downton Abbey\\" which I absolutely love! I can't wait for Season 4!
B004SDSSFY|1.0|BE careful with this &quot; free&quot; app. Installation has crashed my Kindle. Can't even get the Web to open now since trying to install.
B00B5JVXYC|1.0|Worse game I downloaded in a long time. After 10 mins of fiddling around with it, I uninstalled. Do not recommend!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|If you enjoyed Iron Man and all the other Marvel movies you will love The Avengers!!! A must see movie.
